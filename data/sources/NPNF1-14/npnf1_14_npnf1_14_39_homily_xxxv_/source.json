So the Jews, who excelled the Samaritans in knowledge, and had been always familiar with[fn-18-P1824_622695:1-nf] the Prophets, were shown from this cause inferior to them. For these believed even on the testimony of the woman, and without having seen any sign, came forth beseeching Christ to tarry[fn-18-P1825_622908:2-nf] with them; but the Jews, when they had beheld His wonders, not only did not detain Him among them, but even drove Him away, and used every means to cast Him forth from their land, although His very Coming[fn-18-P1826_623129:3-nf] had been for their sake. The Jews expelled Him, but these even entreated Him to tarry with them. Was it not then rather fitting, tell me, that He should receive those who asked and besought Him, than that He should wait upon those who plotted against and repulsed Him, while to those who loved and desired to retain Him He gave not Himself? Surely this would not have been worthy of His tender care;[fn-18-P1827_623552:4-nf] He therefore both accepted[fn-18-P1828_623595:5-nf] them, and tarried with them two days. They desired to keep Him among them continually, (for this the Evangelist has shown by saying, that \"they besought Him that He would tarry with them,\") but this He endured not, but stayed with them only two days; and in these many more believed on Him. Yet there was no likelihood that these would have believed, since they had seen no sign, and had hostile feelings towards the Jews; but still, inasmuch as they gave in sincerity their judgment on His words, this stood not in their way, but they received a notion which surmounted their hindrances, and vied with each other to reverence Him the more. For, saith the Evangelist, \"they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard Him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.\" The scholars overshot their instructress. With good reason might they condemn the Jews, both by their believing on, and their receiving Him. The Jews, for whose sake He had contrived[fn-18-P1829_624633:6-nf] the whole scheme,[fn-18-P1830_624672:7-nf] continually were for stoning Him,[fn-18-P1831_624768:8-nf] but these, when He was not even intending to come to them, drew Him to themselves. And they, even with signs, remain uncorrected; these, without signs, manifested great faith respecting Him, and glory in this very thing that they believe without them; while the others ceased not asking[fn-18-P1832_625089:9-nf] for signs and tempting Him.","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"18","code":"P1824_622695","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"lit. \"brought up with.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1825_622908","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"to be.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1826_623129","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"Ben. \"that coming.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1827_623552","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"khdemoni/aj.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1828_623595","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"elected.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1829_624633","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"instituted.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1830_624672","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"i.e. of Redemption. pa=san th9n pragmatei/an sunesth/sato.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1831_624768","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"them,\" i.e. the Prophets.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1832_625089","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"seeking.\"","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"Such need is there everywhere of an honest soul; and if truth lay hold on such an one, she easily masters it; or if she masters it not, this is owing not to any weakness of truth, but to want of candor[fn-18-P1834_625337:10-nf] in the soul itself.

The Jews did not so, but going about to establish their own righteousness, submitted not themselves to the righteousness of God; while these confess that all are deserving of punishment, declaring with the Apostle, that \"all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; being justified freely by His grace.\" (Rom. iii. 23, Rom. iii. 24.) For by saying that He was \"the Saviour of the world,\" they showed that it was of a lost world,[fn-18-P1837_626307:12-nf] and He not simply a Saviour, but one of the very mightiest. For many had come to \"save,\" both Prophets and Angels[fn-18-P1838_626528:13-nf] ; but this, saith one, is the True Saviour, who affordeth the true salvation, not that which is but for a time. This proceeded from pure faith. And in both ways are they admirable; because they believed, and because they did so without signs, (whom Christ also calleth \"blessed,\" saying, \"Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed,\") (c. xx. 29,) and because they did so sincerely. Though they had heard the woman say doubtfully, \"Is not this the Christ?\" they did not also say, \"we too suspect,\" or, \"we think,\"[fn-18-P1839_627081:14-nf] but, \"we know,\" and not merely, \"we know,\" but, \"we know that this is of a truth the Saviour of the world.\" They acknowledged Christ not as one of the many,[fn-18-P1840_627258:15-nf] but as the \"Saviour\" indeed. Yet whom had they seen saved? They had but heard His words, and yet they spake as they would have spoken had they beheld many and great marvels. And why do not the Evangelists tell us these words, and that He discoursed admirably? That thou mayest learn that they pass by many important matters, and yet have declared the whole to us by the event. For He persuaded an entire people and a whole city by His words. When His hearers are not persuaded, then the writers are constrained to mention what was said, lest any one from the insensibility of the hearers should give a judgment against Him who addressed them.","index":"5","references":[{"fn":"18","code":"P1836_625738","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"e0pi\\ diorqw/sei.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1837_626307","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"ms. in Bodl. reads, \"and why say I of a lost world? of a world which was in evils great exceedingly.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1838_626528","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"or, \"messengers.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1839_627081","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"suppose.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1840_627258","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"i.e. who had wrought deliverances.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"\"Now after two days He departed thence and went into Galilee.\"","index":"6","references":[]},{"text":"Ver. 44. \"For Jesus Himself testified that a Prophet hath no honor in his own country.\"","index":"7","references":[]},{"text":"Wherefore is this added?

For I suppose that in this place He speaketh of Capernaum as \"His country.\" Now, to show that there He received no honor, hear Him say, \"And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell.\" (Matt. xi. 23.) He calleth it \"His own country,\" because there He set forth the Word of the Dispensation, and more especially dwelt upon it. \"What then,\" saith some one, \"do we not see many admired among their kindred?\" In the first place such judgments must not be formed from rare instances; and again, if some have been honored in their own, they would have been much more honored in a strange country, for familiarity is wont to make men easily despised.","index":"8","references":[{"fn":"18","code":"P1844_628329","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"ms. in Bodl. \"and this is, that `a prophet hath no honor in his own country.\f0' \"","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"Ver. 45. \"Then when He was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received Him, having seen all the things that He did at Jerusalem at the feast, for they also came unto the feast.\"","index":"9","references":[]},{"text":"Seest thou that these men so ill spoken of are found most to come to Him?
