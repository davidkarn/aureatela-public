Observe, for instance, when Judas had thrown himself into sin, how great assistance he enjoyed, yet not even so was he raised. Christ said to him, \"One of you is a devil\" (c. vi. 71); He said, \"Not all believe\" (c. vi. 65); He said, \"I speak not of all,\" and, \"I know whom I have chosen\" (c. xiii. 18); and not one of these sayings doth he feel.

Thus schoolmasters write the letters for children very beautifully, that they may come to imitate them though but in an inferior manner. Where now are they who spit on their fellow-servants? where now they who demand honors? Christ washed the feet of the traitor, the sacrilegious, the thief, and that close to the time of the betrayal, and incurable as he was, made him a partaker of His table; and art thou highminded, and dost thou draw up thine eyebrows? \"Let us then wash one another's feet,\" saith some one, \"then we must wash those of our domestics.\" And what great thing if we do wash even those of our domestics? In our case[fn-39-P3997_1326317:11-nf] \"slave\" and \"free\" is a difference of words; but there an actual reality.

Butnow it is matter for contentment if we do not treat free men as bondmen, as slaves bought with money. And what shall we say in that day,[fn-39-P3999_1326669:13-nf] if after receiving proofs of such forbearance, we ourselves do not imitate them at all, but take the contrary part, being in diametrical opposition, lifted up, and not discharging the debt? For God hath made us debtors one to another, having first so done Himself, and hath made us debtors of a less amount. For He was our Lord, but we do it, if we do it at all, to our fellow-servants, a thing which He Himself implied by saying, \"If I then your Lord and Master-so also do ye.\" It would indeed naturally have followed to say, \"How much more should ye servants,\" but He left this to the conscience of the hearers.","index":"7","references":[{"fn":"39","code":"P3997_1326317","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"e0ntau=qa.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"39","code":"P3998_1326464","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"i.e. this humble office.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"39","code":"P3999_1326669","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"to/te.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"[2.] But why hath He done this \"now\"?

On this account He added, \"He that eateth bread with Me,\" and letting pass all the rest, He hath put that which was most fitted to restrain and shame him; \"he who was fed by Me,\" He saith, \"and who shared My table.\" And He spake the words, to instruct them to benefit those who did evil to them, even though such persons should continue incurable.","index":"11","references":[]},{"text":"But having said, \"I speak not of you all,\" in order not to attach fear to more than one,[fn-40-P4010_1331549:19-nf] He at last separateth the traitor, speaking thus; \"He that eateth bread with Me.\" For the, \"not of you all,\" doth not direct the words to any single one, therefore He added, \"He that eateth bread with Me\"; showing to that wretched one that He was not seized in ignorance, but even withfull knowledge; a thing which of itself was most of all fitted to restrain him.

The grasping man, the false accuser, and whoso worketh any other evil thing, do themselves the greatest injury, and us the greatest good, if we do not avenge ourselves. Such a case as this: some one has robbed thee; hast thou given thanks for the injury, and glorified God? by that thanksgiving thou hast gained ten thousand rewards, just as he hath gathered for himself fire unspeakable. But if any one say, \"How then, if I `could' not defend myself against him whowronged me, being weaker?\" I would say this, that thou couldest have put into action the being discontented, the being impatient, (for these things are in our power,) the praying against him, who grieved you, the uttering ten thousand curses against him, the speaking ill of him to every one. He therefore who hath not done these things shall even be rewarded for not defending himself, since it is clear that even if he had had the power, he would not have done it. The injured man uses any weapon that comes to hand, when, being little of soul, he defends himself against one who has injured him, by curses, by abuse, by plotting. Do thou then not only not do these things, but even pray for him; for if thou do them not, but wilt even pray for him, thou art become like unto God. For, \"pray,\" it saith, \"for them, that despitefully use you-that ye may be like unto[fn-40-P4012_1333621:20-nf] your Father which is in Heaven.\" (Matt. v. 44, 45.)

Surely we are enjoined to return the opposite, benefits, prayers. Wherefore Christ also repaid him who was about to betray Him with everything opposite. He washed his feet, convicted him secretly, rebuked him sparingly, tended[fn-40-P4013_1334111:21-nf] him, allowed him to share His table and His kiss, and not even by these[fn-40-P4014_1334202:22-nf] was he made better; nevertheless (Christ) continued doing His own part.","index":"13","references":[{"fn":"40","code":"P4012_1333621","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"\"the children of,\" N.

Will you then that I tell you of Moses, or shall we go yet farther back? For the more ancient the instances that can be pointed out, the more are we surpassed. \"Why so?\" Because virtue was then more difficult. Those men had no written precepts, no patterns of living, but their nature fought, unarmed, by itself,[fn-40-P4016_1334815:23-nf] and was forced to float in all directions unballasted.[fn-40-P4017_1334910:24-nf] Wherefore also when praising Noah, God called him not simply perfect, but added, \"in his generation\" (Gen. vii. 1); signifying, \"at that time,\" when there were many hindrances, since many others shone after him, yet will he have nothing less than they; for in his own time he was perfect. Who then before Moses was patient? The blessed and noble Joseph, who having shone by his chastity, shone no less by his long suffering. He was sold when he had done no wrong, but was waiting on others, and serving, and performing all the duties of domestics. They brought against him an evil accusation, and he did not defend himself, though he had his father on his side. Nay, he even went to carry food to them in the desert, and when he found them not, he did not despair or turn back, (yet he had an excuse for doing so had he chosen,) but remained near the wild beasts and those savage men, preserving the feeling of a true brother. Again, when he dwelt in the prison house, and was asked the cause, he spake no evil of them, but only, \"I have done nothing,\" and, \"I was stolen out of the land of the Hebrews\"; and after this again, whenhe was made lord, he nourished them, and delivered them from ten thousand dangers. If we be sober, the wickedness of our neighbor is not strong enough to cast us out of our own virtue. But those others were not like him; they both stripped him, and endeavored to kill him, and reproach him with his dream, though they had even received their meat from him, and planned to deprive him of life and of liberty. And they ate, and cared not for their brother lying naked in the pit. What could be worse than such brutality? Were they not worse than any number of murderers? And after this, having drawn him up, they gave him over to ten thousand deaths, selling him to barbarian and savage men, who were on their journey to barbarians. Yet he, when he became ruler, not only remitted them their punishment, but even acquitted them, as far at least as relating to himself, of their sin, calling what had been done a dispensation of God, not any wickedness of theirs; and the things which he did against them he did not as remembering evil, but in all these he dissembled, for his brother's[fn-40-P4018_1337146:25-nf] sake. After this, when he saw them clinging to him, he straightway threw away the mask, and wept aloud, and embraced them, as though he had received the greatest benefits, he, who formerly was made away with by them, and he brought them all down into Egypt, and repaid them with ten thousand benefits. What excuse then shall we have, if after the Law, and after grace, and after the addition of so much heavenly wisdom, we do not even strive to rival him who lived before grace and before the Law? Who shall deliver us from punishment? For there is nothing, thereis nothing more grievous than the remembrance of injuries. And this the man hath showed that owed ten thousand talents; from whom payment was at one time not demanded, at another time again demanded; not demanded, because of the lovingkindness of God; but demanded, because of his own wickedness, and because of his malice toward his fellow-servant. Knowing all which things, let us forgive our neighbors their trespasses, and repay them by deeds of an opposite kind, that we too may obtain mercy from God, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
