For this is the natural course of things, and everywhere virtue is wont to engender hatred from wicked men. For envying those who desire to live properly, and thinking to prepare an excuse for themselves if they can overthrow the credit of others, they hate them as having pursuits opposite to their own, and use every means to shame their way of life. But let not us grieve, for this is a mark of virtue. Wherefore Christ also saith, \"If ye were of the world, the world would love its own.\" (c. xv. 19.) And in another place again, \"Woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you.\" (Luke vi. 26.) Wherefore also He saith here, \"I have given them Thy word, and the world hath hated them.\" Again He telleth the reason for which they were worthy to obtain much care from the Father; \"For Thy sake,\" He saith, \"they have been hated, and for Thy word's sake\"; so that they would be entitled to all providential care.","index":"3","references":[]},{"text":"Ver. 15. \"I pray not that Thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that Thou shouldest keep them from the evil.\"","index":"4","references":[]},{"text":"Again He simplifieth[fn-46-P4663_1542932:1-nf] His language; again He rendereth it more clear; which is the act of one showing, by making entreaty for them with exactness, nothing else but this, that He hath a very tender care for them.

For as, when in the case of Him and the Father the \"as\" is used, a great Equality is signified, because of the Relationship in Nature; so when it is used of us and Him, the interval is great, because of the great and infinite interval between the respective natures. For if He \"did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth\" (1 Pet. ii. 22), how could the Apostles be reckoned equal to Him? What isit then that He saith, \"They are not of the world\"? \"They look to another world, theyhave nothing common with earth, but are become citizens of heaven.\" And by these wordsHe showeth His love, when He commendeth them to the Father, and committeth them to Him who begat Him.

How then doth He now ask it from the Father?\" That thou mayest again learn their equality ofHonor. For right doctrines asserted concerning God sanctify the soul.

For when he[fn-47-P4724_1556406:25-nf] helps his domestics and kinsmen and strangers, while thou dost not even succor those who are related to thee by family, what will henceforth be thy excuse, when God is blasphemed and insulted by reason of thee?

Yet the money by being spent will sustain no injury, but thy brother if neglected will perish. What madness then to be careful of money, and careless about one's kindred? Whence hath this craving for riches burst in upon us?[fn-47-P4725_1557447:26-nf] Whence this inhumanity and cruelty? For if any one could, as though seated on the highest bench of a theater, look down upon all the world,-or rather, if you will, let us for the present take in hand a single city,-if then a man seated on an elevated spot could take in at a glance all the doings of the men there, consider what folly he would condemn, what tears he would weep, what laughter he would laugh, with what hatred he would hate; for we commit such actions as deserve both laughter, and the charge of folly, and tears, and hatred. One man keeps dogs to catch[fn-47-P4726_1558036:27-nf] brute animals, himself sinking into brutality; another keeps oxen and asses to transport stones, but neglects men wasting with hunger; and spends gold without limit to make men of stone, but neglects real men, who are becoming like stones through their evil state.

Again, one hath swallowed up another in the law-courts; another hath spent his money on women and parasites, another on stage-players and theatrical bands,[fn-47-P4729_1558827:30-nf] another on splendid edifices, on purchases of fields and houses. Again, one man is counting interest, another interest of interest; another is putting together[fn-47-P4730_1559032:31-nf] bands full of many deaths, and doth not enjoy rest even at night, lying awake for others' harm. Then, when it is day, they run, one to his unjust gain, another to his wanton expense, others to public robbery.[fn-47-P4731_1559261:32-nf] And great is the earnestness about things superfluous and forbidden, but of things necessary no account is taken; and they who decide questions of law have indeed the name of jurymen, but are really[fn-47-P4732_1559516:33-nf] thieves and murderers. And if one should enquire into law suits and wills, he l would find there again ten thousand mischiefs,frauds, robberies, plots, and about these thingsis all time spent; but for spiritual things thereis no care, and they all inconvenience the Church, for the sake of seeing only. But this is not what is required; we need works, and a pure mind.[fn-47-P4733_1559918:34-nf] But if thou spendest all the day in grasping after riches, and then coming in sayest a few words, thou hast not only not propitiated God, but hast even angered Him more. Wouldest thou conciliate thy Lord, exhibit works, make thyself acquainted with the mass of woes, look upon the naked, the hungry, the wronged; He hath cut out for thee ten thousand ways of showing love for men. Let us not then deceive ourselves by living aimlessly and to no purpose, nor presume, because we now are in health; but bearing in mind, that often when we have fallen into sickness, and have reached the extreme of debility, we have been dead with fear and the looking for things to come, let us expect to fall again into the same state, let us get again the same fear, and let us become better men; since what is done now deserves infinite condemnation. For those in the courts of justice are like lions and dogs; those in the public places like foxes; and those who lead a life of leisure, even they do not use their leisure as they ought, speeding all their time on theaters and the mischiefs arising from them. And there is no one to reprove what is being done; but there are many who envy, and are vexed that they are not in the like condition,[fn-47-P4734_1561171:35-nf] so that these in their turn are punished, though not actually doing wicked things. For they \"not only do these things, but also have pleasure in them that do them.\" Because what belongs to their will is alike[fn-47-P4735_1561416:36-nf] corrupt; whence it is plain, that the intention also will be punished. These things I say each day, and I will not cease to say them. For if any listen, it is gain; but if none give heed, ye shall then hear these things, when it will avail you nothing, and ye shall blame yourselves, and we shall be flee from fault. But may it never come to pass that we should only have this excuse, but that you may be our boast before the judgment-seat of Christ, that together we may enjoy the blessings, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, for ever and ever.
