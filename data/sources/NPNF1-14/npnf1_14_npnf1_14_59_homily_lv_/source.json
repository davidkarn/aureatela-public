Again do they betake themselves to his relationship. Yet it would have been suitable to say, \"Art thou greater than God? or they who have heard thee than Abraham?\" But they say not this, because they thought that He was even less than Abraham. At first, therefore, He showed that they were murderers, and so led them away from the relationship; but when they persevered, He contrived this in another way, showing that they labored uselessly. And concerning the \"death,\" He said nothing to them, neither did He reveal or tell them what kind of death He meant, but in the meantime He would have them believe, that He is greater than Abraham, that even by this He may put them to shame. \"Certainly,\" He saith, \"were I a common man I ought not to die, having done no wrong; but when I speak the truth, and have no sin, am sent from God, and am greater than Abraham, are ye not mad, do ye not labor in vain when ye attempt to kill Me?\" What then is their reply? \"Now we know that thou hast a devil.\" Not so spake the woman of Samaria. She said not to Him, \"Thou hast a devil\"; but only, \"Art thou greater than our father Jacob?\" (c. iv. 12.) For these men were insolent and accursed, while she desired to learn; wherefore she doubted and answered with proper moderation, and called Him, \"Lord.\" For one who promised far greater things, and who was worthy of credit, ought not to have been insulted, but even admired; yet these men said that He had a devil. Those expressions of the Samaritan woman were those of one in doubt; these were the words of men unbelieving and perverse. \"Art thou greater than our father Abraham?\" so that this (which He had said) maketh Him to be greater than Abraham. \"When therefore ye have seen Him lifted up,[fn-29-P2999_1011454:5-nf] ye shall confess that He is greater.\" On this account He said,\"When ye have lifted Me[fn-30-P3000_1011561:6-nf] up, ye shall know that I Am.\" (Ver. 28.) And observe His wisdom. Having first rent them away from Abraham's kindred, He showeth that He is greater than Abraham, that so He may be seen to be very exceedingly greater than the Prophets also. Indeed it was because they continually called Him a prophet that He said, \"My word hath no place in you.\" (Ver. 37.) In that other place[fn-30-P3001_1011964:7-nf] He declared that He raiseth the dead, but here He saith, \"He that believeth shall never see death,\" which was a much greater thing than not to allow believers to be holden, by death.

There is nothing worse than a soul hardened in desperation; though it see signs and wonders, it still perseveres in retaining the same shamelessness. Thus Pharaoh, who received ten thousand strokes, was sobered only while being punished, and continued of this character until the last day of his life, pursuing those whom he had let go. Wherefore Paul continually saith, \"Lest any of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.\" (Heb. iii. 13.) For as the callosities[fn-30-P3031_1017500:15-nf] of the body, when formed, become dead, and possess no sensation; so the soul, when it is occupied by many passions, becomes dead to virtue; and apply what you will to it, it gets no perception of the matter, but whether you threaten punishment or anything else, continues insensible.","index":"34","references":[{"fn":"30","code":"P3030_1016706","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"i.e. so that they could not stone Him.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"30","code":"P3031_1017500","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"oi9 tu/loi, a very happy emendation of Mr. Field's for stu=loi, \"pillars,\" of which former editors could make no sense.

For men who have become past feeling, are after that in the blind state[fn-30-P3033_1018204:16-nf] of despairing pilots, who give up their vessel to the wind, and themselves contribute no assistance. Thus the envious man looks to one thing only, that is, to satisfy his lust, and though he be like to be punished or even slain, still he is possessed solely by that passion; and in like manner the intemperate and avaricious. But if the sovereignty of the passions be so great, much greater is that of virtue; if for them we despise death, much more for this; if they (sinners) regard not their own lives, much less ought we to do so in the cause of our salvation. For what shall we have to say, if when they who perish are so active about their own perdition, we for our own salvation manifest not even an equal activity, but ever continue wasting with envy? Nothing is worse than envy; to destroy another it destroys itself also. The eye of the envious wastes away in grief, he lives in a continual death, he deems all men, even those who have never wronged him, his enemies. He grieves that God is honored, he rejoices in what the devil rejoices in. Is any honored among men? This is not honor, envy him not. But is he honored by God? Strive and be thou like him. Thou wilt not? Why then dost thou destroy thyself too? Why castest thou away what thou hast? Canst thou not be like unto him, nor gain any good thing? Why then dost thou besides this take for thyself evil, when thou oughtest to rejoice with him, that so even if thou be not able to share his toils, thou mayest profit by rejoicing with Him? For often even the will is able to effect great good. At least Ezekiel saith, that the Moabites were punished because they rejoiced over the Israelites, and that certain others were saved because they mourned over the misfortunes of their neighbors. (Ezek. xxv. 8.) Now if there be any comfort for those who mourn over the woes of others, much more for those who rejoice at the honors of others. He charged the Moabites with having exulted over the Israelites, yet it was God that punished them; but not even when He punisheth will He have us rejoice over those that are punished. For it is not His wish to punish them. Now if we must condole with those who are punished, much more must we avoid envying. those who are honored. Thus, for example, Corah and Dathan perished with their company, making those whom they envied brighter, and giving themselves up to punishment. For a venomousbeast is envy, an unclean beast, a deliberate vice which admits not of pardon, a wickedness stripped of excuse, the cause and mother of all evils. Wherefore let us pluck it up by the roots, that we may be freed from evil here, and may obtain blessings hereafter; through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost, be glory now and ever and world without end. Amen.","index":"35","references":[{"fn":"30","code":"P3033_1018204","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"phrou=ntai, a conjecture of Dr. Heyse, for peirw=ntai.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"","index":"36","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"37","references":[]}]}]}
