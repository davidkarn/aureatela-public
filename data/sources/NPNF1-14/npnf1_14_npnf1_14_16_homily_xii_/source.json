What then is the habit of most persons? Often when any have seen a king richly decked, and glittering on all sides with precious stones, and are afterwards describing to others the beauty, the ornaments, the splendor, they enumerate as much as they can, the glowing tint of the purple robe, the size of the jewels, the whiteness of the mules, the gold about the yoke, the soft and shining couch. But when after enumerating these things, and other things besides these, they cannot, say what they will, give a full idea of[fn-6-P681_204795:14-nf] the splendor, they immediately bring in: \"But why say much about it; once for all, he was like a king;\" not desiring by the expression \"like,\" to show that he, of whom they say this, resembles a king, but that he is a real king.

But He as Lord and Ruler of all, and this when He appeared in poor and humble form; but even so creation recognized her Lord. Now the star from heaven which called the wise men to worship Him, the vast throng pouring everywhere of angels attending the Lord,[fn-6-P683_205854:15-nf] and hymning His praise, and besides them, many other heralds sprang up on a sudden, and all, as they met,[fn-6-P684_206040:16-nf] declared to one another the glad tidings of this ineffable mystery; the angels to the shepherds; the shepherds to those of the city; Gabriel to Mary and Elisabeth; Anna and Simeon to those who came to the Temple. Nor were men and women only lifted up[fn-6-P685_206319:17-nf] with pleasure, but the very infant who had not yet come forth to light, I mean the citizen of the wilderness, the namesake of this Evangelist, leaped while yet in his mother's womb, and all were soaring[fn-6-P686_206557:18-nf] with hopes for the future. This too immediately after the Birth. But when He had manifested Himself still farther, other wonders, yet greater than the first, were seen. For it was no more star, or sky, no more angels, or archangels, not Gabriel, or Michael, but the Father Himself from heaven above, who proclaimed Him, and with the Father the Comforter, flying down at the uttering of the Voice and resting on Him.

And one might see things strange and wonderful, such as with good cause the prophets desired to see, and saw not. One might see eyes fashioned (John ix. 6, John ix. 7), (might see) Him showing to all in short space and on the more noble portion of the body, that admirable thing which all would have desired to see, how God formed Adam from the earth; palsied and distorted limbs fastened and adapted to each other, dead hands moving, palsied feet leaping amain, ears that were stopped re-opened, and the tongue sounding aloud which before was tied by speechlessness. For having taken in hand the common nature of men, as some excellent workman might take a house decayed by time, He filled up what was broken off, banded together its crevices and shaken portions, and raised up again what was entirely fallen down.","index":"9","references":[{"fn":"6","code":"P688_207303","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"nature.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"6","code":"P689_207491","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"\"Throughout,\" E.

The health of our bodies is a great thing, but that of our souls is as much greater as the soul is better than the body. And not on this account only, but because our bodily nature follows withersoever the Creator will lead it, and there is nothing to resist, but the soul being its own mistress, and possessing power over its acts, does not in all things obey God, unless it will to do so. For God will not make it beautiful and excellent, if it be reluctant and in a manner constrained by force, for this is not virtue at all; but He must persuade it to become so of its own will and choice. And so this cure is more difficult than the other; yet even this succeeded, and every kind of wickedness was banished. And as He re-ordered the bodies which He cured, not to health only, but to the highest vigor, so did He not merely deliver the souls from extremist wickedness, but brought them to the very summit of excellence. A publican became an Apostle, and a persecutor, blasphemer, and injurious, appeared as herald to the world, and the Magi became teachers of the Jews, and a thief was declared a citizen of Paradise, and a harlot shone forth by the greatness of her faith, and of the two women, of Canaan and Samaria, the latter who was another harlot, undertook to preach the Gospel to her countrymen, and having enclosed a whole city in her net,[fn-6-P694_210292:24-nf] so brought them[fn-6-P695_210355:25-nf] to Christ; while the former by faith and perseverance, procured the expulsion of an evil spirit from her daughter's soul; and many others much worse than these were straightway numbered in the rank of disciples, and at once all the infirmities[fn-6-P696_210628:26-nf] of their bodies and diseases of their souls were transformed, and they were fashioned anew to health and exactest virtue. And of these, not two or three men, not five, or ten, or twenty, or an hundred only, but entire cities and nations, were very easily remodeled. Why should one speak of the wisdom of the commands, the excellency of the heavenly laws, the good ordering of the angelic polity? For such a life hath He proposed to us, such laws appointed for us, such a polity established, that those who put these things into practice, immediately become angels and like to God, as far as is in our power, even though they[fn-6-P697_211265:27-nf] may have been worse than all men.","index":"10","references":[{"fn":"6","code":"P694_210292","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"saghneu/sasa from sagh/nh, \"a seine net.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"6","code":"P695_210355","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"brought them out.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"6","code":"P696_210628","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"pa/qh.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"6","code":"P697_211265","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"we.\"","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"[3.] The Evangelist therefore having brought together all these things, the marvels in our bodies, in our souls, in the elements[fn-6-P699_211442:28-nf] (of our faith), the commandments, those gifts ineffable and higher than the heavens, the laws, the polity, the persuasion, the future promises, His sufferings, uttered that voice so wonderful and full of exalted doctrine, saying, \"We beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-Begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.\" For we admire Him not only on account of the miracles, but also by reason of the sufferings; as that He was nailed upon the Cross, that He was scourged, that He was buffeted, that He was spit upon, that He received blows on the cheek from those to whom He had done good. For even of those very things which seem to be shameful, it is proper to repeat the same expression, since He Himself called that action[fn-7-P700_212195:29-nf] \"glory.\" For what then took place was (proof) not only of kindness and love, but also of unspeakable power. At that time death was abolished, the curse was loosed, devils were shamed and led in triumph and made a show of, and the handwriting of our sins was nailed to the Cross. And then, since these wonders were doing invisibly, others took place visibly, showing that He was of a truth the Only-Begotten Son of God, the Lord of all creation. For while yet that blessed Body hung upon the tree, the sun turned away his rays, the whole earth was troubled and became dark, the graves were opened, the ground quaked, and an innumerable multitude of dead leaped forth, and went into the city. And while the stones of His tomb were fastened upon the vault, and the seals yet upon them, the Dead arose, the Crucified, the nail-pierced One, and[fn-7-P701_213062:30-nf] having filled His eleven disciples with His mighty[fn-7-P702_213136:31-nf] power, He sent them to men throughout all the world, to be the common healers of all their kind,[fn-7-P703_213279:32-nf] to correct their way of living, to spread through every part of the earth the knowledge of their heavenly doctrines, to break down the tyranny of devils, to teach those great and ineffable blessings, to bring to us the glad tidings of the soul's immortality, and the eternal life of the body, and rewards which are beyond conception, and shall never have an end. These things then, and yet more than these, the blessed Evangelist having in mind, things which though he knew, he was not able to write, because the world could not have contained them (for if all things \"should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written\"-c. xxi. 25), reflecting therefore on all these, he cries out, \"We beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-Begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.\"","index":"11","references":[{"fn":"6","code":"P699_211442","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"stoixei/oij.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"7","code":"P700_212195","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"i.e. His Crucifixion.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"7","code":"P701_213062","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"then again.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"7","code":"P702_213136","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"a certain irresistible and divine.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"7","code":"P703_213279","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"Or \"of their whole nature.\"","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"It behooves therefore those who have been deemed worthy to see and to hear such things, and who have enjoyed so great a gift, to display also a life worthy of the doctrines, that they may enjoy also the good things which are (laid up) there. For our Lord Jesus Christ came, not only that we might behold His glory here, but also that which shall be. For therefore He saith, \"I will that these[fn-7-P705_214551:33-nf] also be with Me where I am, that they may behold My glory.\" (c. xvii. 24.) Now if the glory here was so bright and splendid, what can one say of that (which shall be)? for it shall appear not on this corruptible earth, nor while we are in perishable bodies, but in a creation which is imperishable, and waxes not old, and with such brightness as it is not possible even to represent in words. O[fn-7-P706_214978:34-nf] blessed, thrice blessed, yea many times so, they who are deemed worthy to be beholders of that glory! It is concerning this that the prophet says, \"Let the unrighteous be taken away, that he behold not the glory of the Lord.\" (Isa. xxvi. 10, Isa. xxvi. 10 LXX.) God grant that not one of us be taken away nor excluded ever from beholding it. For if we shall not hereafter enjoy it, then it is time to say of ourselves, \"Good were it for\" us, \"if\" we \"had never been born.\" For why do we live and breathe? What are we, if we fail of that spectacle, if no one grant us then to behold our Lord? If those who see not the light of the sun endure a life more bitter than any death, what is it likely that they who are deprived of that light must suffer? For in the one case the loss is confined to this one privation; but in the other it does not rest here, (though if this were the only thing to be dreaded, even then the degrees of punishment would not be equal, but one would be as much severer than the other, as that sun is incomparably superior to this,) but now we must look also for other vengeance; for he who beholds not that light must not only be led into darkness, but must be burned continually, and waste away, and gnash his teeth, and suffer ten thousand other dreadful things. Let us then not permit ourselves by making this brief time a time of carelessness and remissness, to fall into everlasting punishment, but let us watch and be sober, let us do all things, and make it all our business to attain to that felicity, and to keep far from that river of fire, which rushes with a loud roaring before the terrible judgment seat. For he who has once been cast in there, must remain for ever; there is no one to deliver him from his punishment, not father, not mother, not brother. And this the prophets themselves declared aloud; one saying, \"Brother delivers not brother. Shall man deliver?\" (Ps. xlix. 7, Ps. xlix. 7 LXX.) And Ezekiel has declared somewhat more than this, saying, \"Though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters.\" (Ezek. xiv. 16.) For one defense[fn-7-P707_217112:35-nf] only, that through works,[fn-7-P708_217155:36-nf] is there, and he who is deprived of that cannot be saved by any other means. Revolving these things, then, and reflecting upon them continually, let us cleanse our life and make it lustrous, that we may see the Lord with boldness, and obtain the promised good things; through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the Holy Spirit, be glory for ever and ever.
