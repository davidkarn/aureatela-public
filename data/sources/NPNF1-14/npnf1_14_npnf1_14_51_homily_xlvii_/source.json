What then, doth He add difficulties to difficulties? No, (that be far from Him,) but by the greatness of the doctrines, and the number of them, He desireth to bring them over. For if one had said simply, \"I have come down from heaven,\" and added nothing more, he would have been the more likely to offend them; but He who said, \"My body is the life of the world\"; He who said, \"As the living Father hath sent Me, so I live by the Father\"; and who said, \"I have come down from heaven,\" solves the difficulty. For the man who utters any one great thing concerning himself may perhaps be suspected of feigning, but he who connects together so many one after another removes all suspicion. All that He doth and saith is intended to lead them away from the thought, that Joseph was His father. And it was not with a wish to strengthen, but rather to do away that stumbling-block, that He said this. For whosoever deemed that He was Joseph's son could not receive His sayings, while one that was persuaded that He had come down from heaven, and would ascend thither, might more easily give heed to His words: at the same time He bringeth forward also another explanation, saying,","index":"20","references":[]},{"text":"Ver. 63. \"It is the Spirit that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing.\"","index":"21","references":[]},{"text":"His meaning is, \"Ye must hear spiritually what relateth to Me, for he who heareth carnally is not profited, nor gathereth any advantage.\" It was carnal to question how He came down from heaven, to deem that He was the son of Joseph, to ask, \"How can he give us His flesh to eat?\" All this was carnal, when they ought to have understood the matter in a mystical and spiritual sense. \"But,\" saith some one, \"how could they understand what the `eating flesh' might mean?\" Then it was their duty to wait for the proper time and enquire, and not to abandon Him.","index":"22","references":[]},{"text":"\"The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life.\"","index":"23","references":[]},{"text":"That is, they are divine and spiritual, have nothing carnal about them, are not subject to the laws of physical consequence, but are free from any such necessity, are even set above the laws appointed for this world, and have also another and a different meaning.

For if a man receives them carnally, he profits nothing. \"What then, is not His flesh, flesh?\" Most certainly. \"How then saith He, that the flesh profiteth nothing?\" He speaketh not of His own flesh, (God forbid!) but of those who received His words in a carnal manner. But what is \"understanding carnally\"? It is looking merely to what is before our eyes, without imagining anything beyond. This is understanding carnally. But we must not judge thus by sight, but must look into all mysteries with the eyes within. This is seeing spiritually. He that eateth not His flesh, and drinketh not His blood, hath no life in him.

Then He added, \"Except it be given him from above from My Father\"; thus persuading them to deem God His Father, not Joseph, and showing them that it is no common thing to believe in Him.

Both because He preserved the dignity befitting a teacher, and also to show them that they ought rather to be attracted by this mode of dealing. For had He praised them, they might, supposing that they were doing Him a favor, have had some human feeling; but by showing them that He needed not their attendance, He kept them to Him the more. And observe with what prudence He spake. He said not, \"Depart ye,\" (this would have been to thrust them from Him,) but asked them a question, \"Will ye also go away?\" the expression of one who would remove all force or compulsion, and who wished not that they should be attached to Him through any sense of shame, but with a sense of favor. By not openly accusing, but gently glancing at them, He showeth what is the truly wise course under such circumstances. But we feel differently; with good reason, since we do everything holding fast our own honor, and therefore think that our estate is lowered by the departure of those who attend on us. But He neither flattered nor repulsed them, but asked them a question.

Then lest it should seem that he had said, \"to whom shall we go?\" because there were none that would receive them, he straightway added, \"Thou hast the words of eternal life.\" For the Jews listened carnally, and with human reasonings, but the disciples spiritually, and committing all to faith. Wherefore Christ said, \"The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit\"; that is, \"do not suppose that the teaching of My words is subject to the rule of material consequences, or to the necessity of created things. Things spiritual are not of this nature, nor endure to submit to the laws of earth.\" This also Paul declareth, saying, \"Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven?

He made not the traitor manifest, yet allowed him not to be hidden; that on the one hand he might not lose all shame, and become more contentious; and on the other, that he might not, thinking to be unperceived, work his wicked deed without fear. Therefore by degrees He bringeth plainer reproofs against him. First, He numbered him too among the others, when He said, \"There are some of you that believe not,\" (for that He counted the traitor the Evangelist hath declared, saying, \"For He knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray Him;\") but when he yet remained such, He brought against him a more severe rebuke, \"One of you is a devil,\" yet made the fear common to them all, wishing to conceal him. And here it is worth while to enquire, why the disciples at this time said nothing, but afterwards were afraid and doubted, looking one upon another, and asking, \"Lord, is it I?\" (Matt. xxvi. 22), when Peter beckoned to John to find out the traitor, by enquiring of their Teacher which was he.

And what He saith is of this kind. \"Nothing abasheth Me from rebuking the bad; think not that because ye have remained I shall choose to flatter you, or that because ye have followed Me I shall not rebuke the wicked.

Yea, surely if there were no punishment, if no kingdom were set before us, it were a duty to show regard for those of like descent and family, to respect those who have like feelings with ourselves. But now we feed dogs, and many of us wild asses, and bears, and different beasts, while we care not for a man perishing with hunger; and a thing alien to us is more valued than that which is of our kin, and our own family less honored than creatures which are not so, nor related to us.","index":"41","references":[{"fn":"26","code":"P2608_881743","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"e0fo/dia ge/gone.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"26","code":"P2609_882006","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"vengeance.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"26","code":"P2610_882149","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"lit. \"throttle.\"","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"Is it a fine thing to build one's self splendid houses, to have many servants, to lie and gaze at a gilded roof? Why then, assuredly, it is superfluous and unprofitable. For other buildings there are, far brighter and more majestic than these; on such we must gladden our eyes, for there is none to hinder us. Wilt thou see the fairest of roofs? At eventide look upon the starred heaven. \"But,\" saith some one, \"this roof is not mine.\" Yet in truth this is more thine than that other. For thee it was made, and is common to thee and to thy brethren; the other is not thine, but theirs who after thy death inherit it. The one may do thee the greatest service, guiding thee by its beauty to its Creator; the other the greatest harm, becoming thy greatest accuser at the Day of Judgment, inasmuch as it is covered with gold, while Christ hath not even needful raiment. Let us not, I entreat you, be subject to such folly, let us not pursue things which flee away, and flee those which endure; let us not betray our own salvation, but hold fast to our hope of what shall be hereafter; the aged, as certainly knowing that but a little space of life is left us; the young, as well persuaded that what is left is not much. For that day cometh so as a thief in the night. Knowing this, let wives exhort their husbands, and husbands admonish their wives; let us teach youths and maidens, and all instruct one another, to care not for present things, but to desire those which are to come, that we may be able also to obtain them; through the grace and loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, now and ever and world without end.
