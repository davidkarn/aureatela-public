For when it has enjoyed no care, it is in a manner timid, not by nature but by will.[fn-42-P4295_1418838:2-nf] For when I see the man who once was brave,[fn-42-P4296_1418897:3-nf] now become a coward, I say that this latter feeling no longer belongs to nature, for what is natural is immutable. Again, when I see those who but now were cowards all at once become daring, I pass the same judgment, and refer all to will. Since even the disciples were very fearful, before they had learned what they ought, and had been deemed worthy of the gift of the Spirit; yet afterwards they became bolder than lions. So Peter, who could not bear the threat of a damsel, was hung with his head downwards, and was scourged, and though he endured ten thousand dangers, would not be silent, but enduring what he endured as though it were a dream, in such a situation spake boldly; but not so before the Crucifixion. Wherefore Christ said, \"Arise, let us go hence.\" \"But why, tell me? Did he not know the hour at which Judas would come upon Him? Or perhaps He feared lest he should come and seize them, and lest the plotters should be upon him before he had furnished his most excellent teaching.\" Away with the thought! these things are far from His dignity. \"If then He did not fear, why did He remove them, and then after finishing His discourse lead them into a garden known to Judas? And even had Judas come, could He not have blinded their eyes, as He also did when the traitor was not present?[fn-42-P4297_1420225:4-nf] Why did He remove them?\" He alloweth the disciples a little breathing time. For it was likely that they, as being in a conspicuous place, would tremble and fear, both on the account of the time and the place, (for it was the depth of night,) and would not give[fn-42-P4298_1420515:5-nf] heed to His words, but would be continually turning about, and imagining that they heard those who were to set upon them; and that more especially when their Master's speech made them expect evil. For, \"yet a little while,\" He saith, \"and I am not with you,\" and, \"the ruler of this world cometh.\" Since now when they heard these and the like words they were troubled, as though they should certainly be taken immediately, He leadeth them to another place, in order that thinking themselves in safety, they might listen to Him without fear. For they were about to hear lofty doctrines. Therefore He saith, \"Arise, let us go hence.\" Then He addeth, and saith,[fn-42-P4299_1421221:6-nf] \"I am the Vine, ye are the branches.\" What willeth He to imply by the comparison? That the man who gives no heed to His words can have no life, and that the miracles about to take place, would be wrought by the power of Christ.\"My Father is the Husbandman.\" \"How then?Doth the Son need a power[fn-43-P4300_1421556:7-nf] working within?\" Away with the thought! this example does not signify this. Observe with what exactness He goeth through the comparison. He saith not that the \"root\" enjoys the care of the Husbandman, but, \"the branches.\" And the foot is brought in in this place for no other purpose, but that they may learn that they can work nothing without His power, and that they ought to be united with Him by faith as the branch with the vine.","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"42","code":"P4295_1418838","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"proai/resin.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"42","code":"P4296_1418897","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"a brave darer.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"42","code":"P4297_1420225","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"to persons present.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"42","code":"P4298_1420515","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"and it was not even possible to give.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"42","code":"P4299_1421221","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"having led them away, He saith.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"43","code":"P4300_1421556","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"e0nergei/aj.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"Ver. 2. \"Every branch in Me that beareth not fruit the Father[fn-43-P4302_1422068:8-nf] taketh away.\"","index":"4","references":[{"fn":"43","code":"P4302_1422068","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"\"He,\" N.

Seest thou that here also, as I am always saying, this is declared because of the infirmity of the hearers? For He chiefly speaketh to their suspicions, and by every means showeth them that they are in safety, and that their enemies are being lost, and that all, whatever they have, they have from the Son, and that, if they show forth a pure life, none shall ever have the mastery over them. And observe that He discourseth with them in a very authoritative manner, for He said not, \"abide in the love of My Father,\" but, \"in Mine\"; then, lest they should say, \"when Thou hast set us at war with all men, Thou leavest us, and departest,\" He showeth that He doth not leave them, but is so joined to them if they will, as the branch in the vine. Then, lest from confidence they should become supine, He saith not that the blessing cannot be removed if they are slack-minded. And in order not to refer the action to Himself, and so make them more apt to fall, He saith, \"Herein is My Father glorified.\" For everywhere He manifesteth His own and His Father's love towards them. Not the things of the Jews, then, were \"glory,\" but those which they[fn-43-P4339_1429026:21-nf] were about to receive.

He reconciled us when we were His enemies, let us, now that we have become His friends, remain so. He led the way, let us at least follow; He loveth us not for His own advantage, (for He needeth nothing,) let us at least love Him for our profit; He loved us being His enemies, let us at least love Him being our friend. At present we do the contrary; for every day God is blasphemed through us, through our plunderings, through our covetousness. And perhaps one of you will say, \"Every day thy discourse is about covetousness.\" Would that I could speak about it every night too; would that I could do so, following you about in the market-place, and at your table; would that both wives, and friends, and children, and domestics, and tillers of the soil, and neighbors, and the very pavement and walls, could ever shout forth this word, that so we might perchance have relaxed a little. For this malady hath seized upon all the world, and occupies the souls of all, and great is the tyranny of Mammon. We have been ransomed by Christ, and are the slaves of gold. We proclaim the sovereignty of the one, and obey the other. Whatever \"he\" commands we readily obey, and we have refused to know family, or friendship, or nature, or laws, or anything, for him. No one looks up to Heaven, no one thinks about things to come. But there will be a time, when there will be no profit even in[fn-43-P4341_1431103:22-nf] these words. \"In the grave,\" itsaith, \"who shall confess to Thee?\" Gold is adesirable thing, and procures us much luxury, and makes us to be honored, but not in like manner as doth Heaven. For from the wealthy man many even turn aside, and hate him, but him who lives virtuously they respect and honor. \"But\" saith some one \"the poor man is derided, even though he be virtuous.\" Not among men, but brutes.[fn-43-P4342_1431533:23-nf] Wherefore he ought not so much as to notice them. For if asses were to bray and daws chatter at us, while all wise men commended us, we should not, losing sight ofthis latter audience, have regard to clamors of the brutes; for like to daws, and worse than asses, are they who admire present things. Moreover, if an earthly king approve thee, thou makest no account of the many, though they all deride thee; but if the Lord of the universe praise thee, seekest thou the good words of beetles and gnats? For this is what these men are, compared with God, or rather not even this, but something viler, if there be aught such. How long do we wallow in the mire? How long do we set sluggards and belly-gods for our judges?They can prove dicers well, drunkards, those who live for the belly, but as for virtue and vice, they cannot imagine so much as a dream. If any one taunt thee because thou hast not skill to draw the channels of the watercourses,[fn-43-P4343_1432495:24-nf] thou wilt not think it any terrible thing, but wilt even laugh at him who objects to thee ignorance of this kind; and dost thou, when thou desirest to practice virtue, appoint as judges those who know nothing of it? On this account we never reach that art. We commit our case not to the practiced, but to the unlearned, and they judge not according to the rules of art, but according to their own ignorance. Wherefore, I exhort you, let us despise the many; or rather let us desire neither praises, nor possessions, nor wealth, nor deem poverty any evil. For poverty is to us a teacher of prudence, and endurance, and all true wisdom. Thus Lazarus lived in poverty, and received a crown; Jacob desired to get bread only; and Joseph was in the extreme of poverty, being not merely a slave, but also a prisoner; and on this account we admire him the more, and we do not so much praise him when he distributed the corn, as when he dwelt in the dungeon: not when he wore the diadem, but when the chain; not when he sat upon the throne, but when he was plotted against and sold.[fn-43-P4344_1433688:25-nf] Considering then all these things, and the crowns twined for us after the conflicts, let us admire not wealth, and honor, and luxury, and power, but poverty, and the chain, and bonds, and endurance in the cause of virtue. For the end of those things is full of troubles and confusion, and their lot is bound up with this present life; but the fruit of these, heaven, and the good things in the heavens, which neither eye hath seen, nor ear heard; which may we all obtain, through the grace and lovingkindness of I our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever. Amen.","index":"29","references":[{"fn":"43","code":"P4341_1431103","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"no time for.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"43","code":"P4342_1431533","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"a0lo/goij.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"43","code":"P4343_1432495","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"Tou\\j o0xetou\\j tw=n a0marw=n e#lkein.
