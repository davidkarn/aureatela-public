This is My commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you.\"","index":"2","references":[]},{"text":"[1.] All things good then have their reward, when they arrive at their proper end, but if they be cut off midway, shipwreck ensues. And as a vessel of immense burden, if it reach not the harbor in time, but founder in the midst of the sea, gains nothing from the length of the voyage, but even makes the calamity greater, in proportion as it has endured more toils; so are those souls which fall back when near the end of their labors, and faint in the midst of the struggle. Wherefore Paul said, that glory, and honor, and peace, should meet those who ran their course with patient continuance in well-doing. A thing which Christ now effecteth in the case of the disciples. (Rom. ii. 7.) For since He had accepted them, and they rejoiced in Him, and then the sudden coming of the Passion and His sad words were likely to cut short their pleasureafter having conversed with them sufficiently to soothe them, He addeth, \"These things have I spoken unto you, that My joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be fulfilled\"; that is, \"that ye might not be separated from Me that ye might not cut short your course. Ye were rejoicing in Me, and ye were rejoicing exceedingly, but despondency hath fallen upon you. This then. I remove, that joy may come at the last, showing that your present circumstances are fit cause, not for pain, but for pleasure. I saw you offended; I despised you not; I said not, `Why do ye not continue noble?' But I spake to you words which brought comfort with them. And so I wish ever to keep you in the same love. Ye have heard concerning a kingdom, ye rejoiced. In order therefore that your joy might be fulfilled, I have spoken these things unto you.\" But\"this is the commandment, that ye love one another as I have loved you.\" Seest thou that the love of God is intertwined with Our own, and connected like a sort of chain? Wherefore it sometimes saith that there are two commandments, sometimes only one. For it is not possible that the man who hath taken hold on the first should not possess the second also. For at one time He said, \"On this the Law and the Prophets hang\"[fn-43-P4351_1436663:1-nf] (Matt. xxii. 40); and at another, \"Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them, for this is theLaw and the Prophets.\" (Matt. vii. 12.) And, \"Love is the fulfilling of the Law.\" (Rom. xiii. 10.) Which He saith also here; for if to abide proceeds from love, and love from the keeping of the commandments, and the commandment is that we love one another, then the abiding in God proceeds from love towards each other. And He doth not simply speak of love, but declareth also the manner, \"As I have loved you.\" Again He showeth, that His very departure was not of hatred but of love. \"So that I ought rather to be admired on this account, for I lay down My life for you.\"[fn-43-P4352_1437392:2-nf] Yet nowhere doth He say this in these words, but in a former place, by sketching the best shepherd, and here by exhorting them, and by showing the greatness of His love, and Himself, who He is. But wherefore doth He everywhere exalt love? Because this is the mark of the disciples, this the bond of virtue.[fn-43-P4353_1437801:3-nf] On this account Paul saith such great things of it, as being a genuine disciple of Christ, and having had experience of it.","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"43","code":"P4351_1436663","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"\"On these two commandments,\" &c.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"43","code":"P4352_1437392","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"Ver. 13. \"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\" N.

For if we reflect on these things, all will be most easy and tolerable. Since if one suffering for those he loves is even proud of it, what feeling of things dreadful will he have who suffers for the sake of God? For if He, for our sake, calleth that shameful thing, the Cross, \"glory\" (c. xiii. 31), much more ought we to be thus disposed. And if we can so despise sufferings, much more shall we be able to despise riches, and covetousness. We ought then, when about to endure anything unpleasant, to think not of the toils but of the crowns; for as merchants take into account not the seas only, but also the profits, so ought we to reckon on heaven and confidence towards God. And if the getting more seem a pleasant thing, think that Christ willeth it not, and straightway it will appear displeasing. And if it be grievous to you to give to the poor, stay not your reckoning at the expense, but straightway transport your thoughts to the harvest which results from the sowing; and when it is hard to despise the love of a strange woman, think of the crown which comes after the struggle, and thou shalt easily bear the struggle. For if fear diverts a man from unseemly things, much more should the love of Christ. Difficult is virtue; but let us cast around her form the greatness of the promise of things to come. Indeed those who are virtuous, even apart from these promises, see her beautiful in herself, and on this account go after her, and work because it seems good to God, not for hire; and they think it a great thing to be sober-minded, not in order that they may not be punished, but because God hath commanded it. But if any one is too weak for this, let him think of the prizes. So let us do in respect of alms-doing, let us pity our fellow-men, let us not, I entreat,[fn-44-P4409_1451917:23-nf] neglect them when perishing with hunger. How can it be otherwise than an unseemly thing, that we should sit at the table laughing and enjoying ourselves, and when we hear others wailing as they pass through the street, should not even turn at their cries, but be wroth with them, and call them \"cheat\"? \"What meanest thou, man? Doth any one plan a cheat for a single loaf of bread?\" \"Yes,\" saith some one. Then in this case above all let him be pitied; in this case above all let him be delivered from his need. Or if thou art not minded to give, do not insult either; if thou wilt not save the wreck, do not thrust it into the gulf. For consider, when thou thrustest away the poor man who comes to thee, who thou wilt be when thou callest upon God. \"With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\" (Matt. vii. 2.) Consider how he departs, crushed, bowed down, lamenting; besides his poverty having received also the blow from your insolence. For if ye count the begging a curse, think what a tempest it makes, begging to get nothing, but to go away insulted. How long shall we be like wild beasts, and know not nature itself through greediness? Many groan at these words; but I desire them not now, but always, to have this feeling of compassion. Think, I pray you, of that day when we shall stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, when we shall beg for mercy, and Christ, bringing them forward, shall say, \"For the sake of a single loaf, of a single obol, so great a surge did ye raise in these souls!\" What shall we reply? What defense shall we make? To show that He will bring them forward, hear what He saith; \"Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of these, ye did it not to Me.\" (Matt. xxv. 45.) They will no more say anything to us, but God on their behalf will upbraid us. Since the rich man saw Lazarus too,[fn-44-P4410_1453770:24-nf] and Lazarus said nothing to him, but Abraham spake for him; and thus it will be in the case of the poor who are now despised by us. We shall not see them stretching out their hands in pitiful state, but being in rest; and we shall take the state which was theirs (and would that it were that state only, and not one much more grievous) as a punishment. For neither did the rich man desire to be filled with crumbs \"there,\" but was scorched and tormented sharply, and was told, \"Thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things.\" (Luke xvi. 25.) Let us not then deem wealth any great thing; it will help us on our way to punishment, if we take not heed, just as, if we take heed, poverty also becomes to us an addition of enjoyment and rest. For we both put off our sins if we bear it with thankfulness, and gain great boldness before God.","index":"39","references":[{"fn":"44","code":"P4408_1449947","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"a0rxhgo\\n, so rendered in margin of E.

And this may we all obtain, by the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with the Father and the Holy Ghost be the glory and the might for ever. Amen.","index":"41","references":[{"fn":"44","code":"P4414_1457115","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"Ben. omits \"all things so near their end.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"44","code":"P4415_1457292","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"e0reugome/nwn.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"","index":"42","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"43","references":[]}]}]}
