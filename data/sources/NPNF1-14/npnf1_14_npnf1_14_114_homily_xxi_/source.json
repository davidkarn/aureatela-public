He said, that they who left father or mother, or brethren, or sisters, should have both fathers and mothers; And this we see fulfilled by facts. He said, \"in the world ye shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world\" (John xvi. 33), that is, no man shall get the better of you. And this we see by the events has come to pass. He said that \"the gates of hell shall not prevail against the Church\" (Matt. xvi. 18), even though persecuted, and that no one shall quench the preaching [of the Gospel]: and the experience of events bears witness to this prediction also: and yet when He said these things, it was very hard to believe Him. Why? Because all these were words, and He had not as yet given proof of the things spoken. So that they have now become far more credible. He said that \"when the Gospel should have been preached among all the nations, then the end shall come\" (Matt. xxiv. 14); lo! now ye have arrived at the end: for the greater part of the world hath been preached to, therefore the end is now at hand.
