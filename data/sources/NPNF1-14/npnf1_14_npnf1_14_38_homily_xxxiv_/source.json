What then may be the cause of this? for the grace of the Spirit did not ordain it to be so without a reason, but why and wherefore? On two accounts; one, that the discourse may be more vivid, and bring what is said more clearly before our eyes. For the mind when it has laid hold on a familiar image of the matters in hand, is more aroused, and beholding them as it were in a picture, is occupied by them to a greater degree. This is one reason; the other is, that the statement may be sweetened, and that the memory of what is said may be more lasting.

At present we do the opposite of this, for we fear not Him who shall judge us, but shudder at those who do not in anything hurt us, and tremble at the shame which comes from them. Therefore in the very thing which we fear, in this do we incur punishment. For he who now regards only the reproach of men, but when God seeth is not ashamed to do anything unseemly, and who will not repent and be converted, in that day will be made an example, not only before one or two, but in the sight of the whole world. For that a vast assembly is seated there to behold righteous actions as well as those which are not such, let the parable of the sheep and the goats teach thee, as also the blessed Paul when He saith, \"For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad\" (2 Cor. v. 10), and again, \"Who will bring to light the hidden things of darkness.\" (1 Cor. iv. 5.) Hast thou done or imagined any evil thing, and dost thou hide it from man? yet from God thou hidest it not. But for this thou careth nothing; the eyes of men, these are thy fear. Think then that thou wilt not be able to escape the sight even of men in that day[fn-18-P1810_616772:16-nf] ; for all things as in a picture shall then be set before our very eyes, so that each shall be self-condemned. This is clear even from the instance of Dives, for the poor man whom he had neglected, Lazarus I mean, he saw standing before his eyes, and the finger which he had often loathed, he intreats may become a comfort to him then. I exhort you therefore, that although no one see what we do, yet that each of us enter into his own conscience, and set reason for his judge, and bring forward his transgressions, and if he desire them not to be exposed to public view then in that fearful day, let him now heal his wounds, let him apply to them the medicines of repentance. For it is in the power, yea, it is in the power of one full of ten thousand wounds to go hence whole. For \"if ye forgive,\" He saith, \"your sins are forgiven unto you.\"[fn-18-P1811_617697:17-nf] (Matt. vi. 14, not verbally quoted.) For as sins buried[fn-18-P1812_617874:18-nf] in Baptism appear no more, so these[fn-18-P1813_617931:19-nf] also shall disappear, if we be willing to repent. And repentance is the not doing the same again; for he that again puts his hand to the same, is like the dog that returneth to his own vomit, and like him in the proverb who cards wool into the fire,[fn-18-P1814_618216:20-nf] and draws water into a cask full of holes. It behooves therefore to depart both in action and in thought from what we have dared to do, and having departed, to apply to the wounds the remedies which are the contraries of our sins. For instance: hast thou been grasping and covetous? Abstain from rapine, and apply almsgiving to the wound. Hast thou been a fornicator? Abstain from fornication, and apply chastity to the wound. Hast thou spoken ill of thy brother, and injured him? Cease finding fault,[fn-18-P1815_618814:21-nf] and apply kindness. Let us thus act with respect to each point in which we have offended, and let us not carelessly pass by our sins, for there awaiteth us hereafter, there awaiteth us a season of account. Wherefore also Paul said, \"The Lord is at hand: be careful for nothing.\" (Phil. iv. 5, Phil. iv. 6.) But we perhaps must add the contrary of this, \"The Lord is at hand, be careful.\" For they might well hear, \"Be careful for nothing,\" living as they did in affliction, and labors, and trials; but they who live by rapine, or in luxury, and who shall give a grievous reckoning, would in reason hear not this, but that other, \"The Lord is at hand, be careful.\" Since no long time now remains until the consummation, but the world is hastening to its end; this the wars declare, this the afflictions, this the earthquakes, this the love which hath waxed cold. For as the body when in its last gasp and near to death, draws to itself ten thousand sufferings; and as when a house is about to fall, many portions are wont to fall beforehand from the roof and walls; so is the end of the world nigh and at the very doors, and therefore ten thousand woes are everywhere scattered abroad. If the Lord was then \"at hand,\" much more is He now \"at hand.\" If three hundred[fn-18-P1816_620105:22-nf] years ago, when those words were used, Paul called that season \"the fullness of time,\" much more would he have called the present so. But perhaps for this very reason some disbelieve, yet they ought on this account to believe the more. For whence knowest thou, O man, that the end is not \"at hand,\" and the words shortly to be accomplished? For as we speak of the end of the year not as being the last day, but also the last month, though it has thirty days; so if of so many years I call even four hundred years \"the end,\" I shall not be wrong; and so at that time Paul spoke of the end by anticipation. Let us then set ourselves in order, let us delight in the fear of God; for if we live here without fear of Him, His coming will surprise us suddenly, when we are neither careful, nor looking for Him. As Christ declared when He said, \"For as in the days of Noah, and as in the days of Lot, so shall it be at the end of this world.\" (Matt. xxiv. 37, not verbally quoted.) This also Paul declared when he said, \"For when they shall say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child.\" (1 Thess. v. 3.) What means, \"as travail upon a woman with child\"? Often have pregnant women when sporting, or at their meals, or in the bath or market-place, and foreseeing nothing of what was coming, been seized in a moment by their pains. Now since our case is like theirs, let us ever be prepared, for we shall not always hear these things, we shall not always have power to do them. \"In the grave\" saith David, \"who shall give Thee thanks?\"([fn-18-P1817_621714:23-nf] (Ps. vi. 5.) Let us then repent here, that so we may find God merciful unto us in the day that is to come, and be enabled to enjoy abundant forgiveness; which may we all obtain, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and dominion now and ever, and world without end. Amen.","index":"25","references":[{"fn":"18","code":"P1810_616772","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"ms. in Bodleian reads here, \"and be more careful than thy (present) self.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1811_617697","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"ms. in Bodl. reads, \"My Heavenly Father will also forgive you, but if ye forgive not, neither will He forgive you.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1812_617874","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"kataxwnnu/mena.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1813_617931","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"i.e. sins done after Baptism.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1814_618216","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"Ei/j pu=r cai/nonti.
