For had He done all as God, how could we have known, on falling in with such things as we wished not, what we must do? As, for instance, when He was in this very place, and the Jews would have killed Him, He came into the midst of them, and so appeased the tumult. Now had He done this continually, how should we, not being able to do so, and yet falling into the like case, have known in what way we ought to deal with the matter, whether to perish at once, or even to use some contrivance[fn-26-P2665_900434:3-nf] in order that the word might go forward? Since, therefore, we who have no power could not have understood what to do on coming into the midst of our foes, on this account we are taught this very thing by Him. For, saith the Evangelist, Jesus, \"when He had said these words, abode in Galilee; but when His brethren were gone up, then went He up also unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.\" The expression, \"when His brethren were gone up,\" is that of one showing that He chose not to go up with them. On which account He abode where He was, and manifested not Himself, although they in a manner urged[fn-26-P2666_901079:4-nf] Him to do so. But why did He, who ever spake openly, do so now \"as it were in secret\"? The writer saith not \"secretly,\" but, \"as it were in secret.\" For thus, as I have said, He seemed[fn-26-P2667_901285:5-nf] to be instructing us how to manage matters.

Now there are many reasons for His using lowly words, as that He might not be deemed unbegotten, or opposed to God, His being clothed with flesh, the infirmity of His hearers, that He might teach men to be modest, and to speak no great thing of themselves: while for speaking lofty words one could only find one reason, the greatness of His Nature.

And that this was no imagination of theirs, but His own declared judgment,[fn-27-P2713_909868:28-nf] and that He spake not as do the many, but in a special and peculiar sense, is clear from this circumstance. Many often called God their Father; as \"Have we not all one Father, hath not one God created us?\" (Mal. ii. 10), but not for that was the people equal to God, on which account the hearers were not offended. As then when the Jews said, \"This man is not from God,\" He often healed them,[fn-27-P2714_910275:29-nf] and made defense for the violation of the Sabbath; so now had the sense they assigned to His words been according to their imagination, not according to His intention, He would have corrected them, and said, \"Why suppose ye Me equal to God? I am not equal\"; yet He said nothing of the kind, but, on the contrary, declared by what followed, that He is equal. For, \"As the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them, so also the Son\" (c. v. 21); and \"That all may honor the Son as they honor the Father\"; and \"The works which He doeth, the same doeth the Son likewise;\" all these go to establish His equality. Again, concerning the Law He saith, \"Think not that I am come to destroy the Law or the Prophets.\" (Matt. v. 17.) Thus He knoweth how to remove evil suspicions which are in their minds; but in this place He not only doth not remove, but even confirmeth their suspicion of His equality. On which account also, when they said in another place, \"Thou makest thyself God,\" He did not remove their suspicion, but even confirmed it, saying, \"That ye may know that the Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive sins, He saith to the sick of the palsy, Take up thy bed, and walk.\"[fn-27-P2715_911487:30-nf] (Matt. ix. 6.) This then He first aimed at, to make Himself equal with God, showing that He was not God's adversary, but that He said the same and taught the same with Him, and afterwards He setteth Himself to[fn-27-P2716_911729:31-nf] the breach of the Sabbath, saying, \"Did not Moses give you the Law, and none of you keepeth the Law?\" As though He had said, \"The Law saith, Thou shall not kill; but ye kill, and yet accuse Me as transgressing the Law.\" But wherefore saith He, \"None of you\"? Because they all sought to kill Him. \"And if,\" He saith, \"I even have broken the Law, it was in saving a man, but ye transgress it for evil. And if My action was even a transgression, yet it was in order to save, and I ought not to be judged by you who transgress in the greatest matters. For your conduct is a subverting of the whole Law.\" Then also He presseth it farther, although He had said many things to them before, but at that former time He spake after a loftier manner, and more suitably to His own dignity, while now He speaketh more humbly. Wherefore? Because He would not continually irritate them. At present their anger had become intense, and they went on to murder. And therefore He continueth to check them in these two ways, by reproving their evil daring, and saying, \"Why go ye about to kill Me?\" and by modestly calling Himself, \"A Man that hath told you the truth\" (c. viii. 40), and by showing that murderers in heart are not worthy to judge others.

Though we have Noah, Job, or Daniel for a father, this will avail us nothing if we be betrayed by our own works. One thing alone we need, that is, excellency of soul. This will be able to carry you safe through, and to deliver you from everlasting fire, this will escort[fn-27-P2739_919743:46-nf] you to the Kingdom of Heaven. To which may we all attain, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, now and ever and world without end. Amen.
