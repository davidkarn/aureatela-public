Observe, for instance, how this is the case with the Jews; for because they were intent upon gluttony, entirely occupied with worldly things, and without any spiritual thoughts, though Christ leads them on by ten thousand sayings, sharp and at the same time forbearing, even thus they arise not, but continue groveling below. For consider; He said to them, \"Ye seek Me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the bread, and were filled \"; He touched them by the reproof, He showed them what food they ought to seek, saying, \"Labor not for the meat that perisheth\"; He set before them the prize, saying, \"but that which endureth unto everlasting life\"; then provided a remedy for what might have been an objection, by declaring that He was sent from the Father.","index":"3","references":[]},{"text":"What then did they?

Else why did they mention none other of the miracles of old, though many took place in those times, both in Egypt and at the sea and in the wilderness, but only that of the manna? Was it not because they greatly desired that one by reason of the tyranny of their bellies? Ye who when ye saw His miracle called him a Prophet, and attempted to make Him a king, how is that now, as though none had been wrought, ye have become thankless and ill-minded, and ask for a sign, uttering words fit for parasites, or hungry dogs?

Now because they sought these (carnal). things, He would have corrected them by His succeeding words, yet not even so did they desist. When He promised the Samaritan woman that He would give her \"the water,\" He made no mention of the Father. What saith He? \"If thou knewest who it is that saith unto thee, Give Me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of Him, and He would have given unto thee living water\" (c. iv. 10); and again, \"The water which I shall give.\" He referreth her not to The Father.

And He calleth that other the \"true bread,\" not because the miracle of the manna was false, but because it was a type, and not the very truth. But in mentioning Moses, He doth not compare Himself to him, for the Jews did not as yet prefer Him to Moses, of whom they still had a higher opinion. So that after saying, \"Moses gave not,\" He addeth not that \"I give,\" but saith that The Father, and not Moses, giveth. They, when they heard this, replied, \"Give us this bread to eat\"; for they yet thought that it was something material, they yet expected to gratify their appetites, and so hastily ran to Him.

And first He discourseth of His Godhead, saying, \"I am the bread of life.\" For this is not spoken of His Body, (concerning that He saith towards the end, \"And the bread which I shall give is My flesh,\") but at present it referreth to His Godhead. For That, through God the Word, is Bread, as this bread also, through the Spirit descending on it, is made Heavenly Bread. Here He useth not witnesses, as in His former address, for He had the miracle of the loaves to witness to Him, and the Jews themselves for a while pretending to believe Him; in the former case they opposed and accused Him. This is the reason why here He declareth Himself. But they, since they expected to enjoy a carnal feast, were not[fn-24-P2437_825003:6-nf] disturbed until they gave up their hope. Yet not for that was Christ silent, but uttered many words of reproof. For they,[fn-24-P2438_825154:7-nf] who while they were eating called Him a Prophet, were here offended, and called Him the carpenter's son; not so while they ate the loaves, then they said, \"He is The Prophet,\" and desired to make Him a king. Now they seemed to be indignant at His asserting that He \"came down from heaven,\" but in truth it was not this that caused their indignation, but the thought that they should not enjoy a material table. Had they been really indignant, they ought to have asked and enquired how He was the \"bread of life,\" how He had \"come down from heaven\"; but now they do not this, but murmur. And that it was not this which offended them is plain from another circumstance. When He said, \"My Father giveth you the bread,\" they exclaimed not, \"Beseech Him that He give\"; but what? \"Give us that bread\"; yet He said not, \"I give,\" but, \"My Father giveth\"; nevertheless, they, from desire of the food, thought Him worthy to be trusted to for its supply. Now how should they, who deemed Him worthy of their trust for giving, be afterward offended when they also heard that \"the Father giveth\"? What is the reason? It is that when they heard that they were not to eat, they again disbelieved, and put forth by way of a cloak for their disbelief, that \"it was a high saying.\" Wherefore He saith, \"Ye have seen Me, and believe not\" (c. v. 39); alluding partly to His miracles, partly to the testimony from the Scriptures; \"For they,\" He saith, \"are they which testify of Me\" (c. v. 43, v. 44); and, \"I am come in My Father's Name, and ye receive Me not\"; and, \"How can ye believe which receive honor of men?\"[fn-24-P2439_826770:8-nf] ","index":"16","references":[{"fn":"24","code":"P2437_825003","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"remain and are not.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"24","code":"P2438_825154","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"Ben. \"But they.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"24","code":"P2439_826770","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"one of another?\"","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"Ver. 37. \"All that the Father giveth Me shall come to Me, and him that cometh to Me I will in nowise cast out.\"","index":"17","references":[]},{"text":"Observe how He doeth all things for the sake of them that are saved; therefore He added this, that He might not seem to be trifling and speaking these things to no purpose. But what is it that He saith, \"All that the Father giveth Me shall come unto Me\" (ver. 37), and \"I will raise it[fn-24-P2442_827192:9-nf] up in the last day\"? (Ver. 40.) Wherefore speaketh He of the common resurrection, in which even the ungodly have a part, as though it were the peculiar gift of those who believe on Him? Because He speaketh not simply of resurrection, but of a particular kind of resurrection. For having first said, \"I will not cast him out, I shall lose nothing of it,\" He then speaketh of the resurrection. Since in the resurrection some are cast out,[fn-24-P2443_827645:10-nf] (\"Take him, and cast him into outer darkness,\" Matt. xxii. 13,) and some are destroyed. (\"Rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.\") (Matt. x. 28.) And[fn-24-P2444_827856:11-nf] the expression, \"I give eternal life\" (c. x. 28), declareth this; for they \"that have done evil shall go forth to the resurrection of damnation, and they that have done good to the resurrection of life.\"[fn-24-P2445_828080:12-nf] (c. v. 29.) This then, the resurrection to good things,[fn-24-P2446_828161:13-nf] is that which He here designed. But what meaneth He by saying, \"All that the Father giveth Me, shall come to Me\"? He toucheth their unbelief, showing that whosoever believeth not on Him transgresseth the will of the Father. And thus He saith it not nakedly, but in a covert manner, and this He doth[fn-24-P2447_828488:14-nf] everywhere, wishing to show that unbelievers are at variance with the Father, not with Him alone. For if this is His will, and if for this He came, that He might save man,[fn-24-P2448_828696:15-nf] those who believe not transgress His will. \"When therefore,\" He saith, \"the Father guideth any man, there is nothing that hindereth him from coming unto Me\"; and in another place, \"No man can come unto Me, except the Father draw him.\" (Ver. 44.) And Paul saith, that He delivereth them up unto the Father; \"When He shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father.\" (1 Cor. xv. 24.) Now as the Father when He giveth doth so without first depriving Himself, so the Son when He delivereth up doth so without excluding Himself. He is said to deliver us up, because through Him we have access (to the Father).","index":"18","references":[{"fn":"24","code":"P2442_827192","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"Ben. \"him.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"24","code":"P2443_827645","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"Ben. \"as appears from,\" &c.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"24","code":"P2444_827856","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"So that.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"24","code":"P2445_828080","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"clauses transposed.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"24","code":"P2446_828161","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"e0pi\\ toi=j a0gaqoi=j.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"24","code":"P2447_828488","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"thou wilt see Him doing,\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"24","code":"P2448_828696","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"all the world.\"","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"[3.] And the \"by whom\"[fn-24-P2450_829362:16-nf] is also applied to the Father, as when the Apostle saith, \"By whom ye were called unto the fellowship of His Son\" (1 Cor. i. 9): and,[fn-24-P2451_829511:17-nf] \"By the will of the Father.\" And again; \"Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee.\" (Matt. xvi. 17.)

For if Thou also desirest this, it is very clear that Thy will and the Father's is one. In another place also He saith, \"For as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them, even so the Son quickeneth whom He will.\" (c. v. 21.) But what is the will of the Father? Is it not, that not so much as one of them should perish? This Thou willest also. (Matt. xviii. 14.) So that the will of the One differeth not from the will of the Other. So[fn-24-P2461_831930:22-nf] in another place He is seen establishing yet more firmly His equality with the Father, saying, \"I and My Father `will come, and will make Our abode with him.'\" (c. xiv. 23.) What He saith then is this; \"I came not to do anything other than that which the Father willeth, I have no will of Mine own different from that of the Father, for all that is the Father's is Mine, and all that is Mine is the Father's.\" If now the things of the Father and the Son are in common, He saith with reason, \"Not that I might do Mine own will.\" But here He speaketh not so, but reserveth this for the end. For, as I have said, He concealeth and veileth for a while high matters, and desireth to prove that had He even said, \"This is My will,\" they would have despised Him. He therefore saith, that \"I co-operate with that Will,\" desiring thus to startle them more; as though He had said, \"What think ye? Do ye anger Me by your disbelief? Nay, ye provoke My Father.\" \"For this is the will of Him that sent Me, that of all which He hath given Me I should lose nothing.\" (Ver. 39.) Here He showeth that He needeth not their service, that He came not for His own advantage,[fn-24-P2462_833355:23-nf] but for their salvation; and not to get honor from them.

Let us continually say to others,[fn-24-P2468_835069:27-nf] and to ourselves, \"There is a resurrection, and a fearful tribunal awaiteth us.\" If we see any man insolent and puffed up with the good things of his world, let us make the same remark to him, and show him that all those things abide here: and if we observe another grieving and impatient, let us say the same to him, and point out to him that his sorrows shall have an end; if we see one careless and dissipated,[fn-24-P2469_835510:28-nf] let us say the same charm over him, and show that for his carelessness he must render account.

No one of those who have lived aright disbelieves the Resurrection, but every day they pray and repeat that holy sentence, \"Thy Kingdom come.\" Who then are they that disbelieve the Resurrection? They who have unholy ways and an unclean life: as the Prophet saith, \"His ways are always polluted. Thy judgments are far above out of his sight.\" (Ps. x. 5.) For a man cannot possibly live a pure life without believing in the Resurrection; since they who are conscious of no iniquity both speak of, and wish for, and believe in it, that they may receive their recompense. Let us not then anger Him, but hear Him when He saith, \"Fear Him which is able to destroy both body and soul in hell\" (Matt. x. 28); that by that fear we may become better, and being delivered from that perdition, may be deemed worthy of the Kingdom of Heaven. Which may we all attain to, through the grace and loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, now and ever and to the endless ages of eternity. Amen.","index":"27","references":[{"fn":"24","code":"P2473_837781","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"seized.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"24","code":"P2474_837841","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"him only.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"24","code":"P2475_838120","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"prooi/mion.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"24","code":"P2476_838392","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"lit. \"fair weather.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"24","code":"P2477_838851","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"dost thou not confess?\"","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"","index":"28","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"29","references":[]}]}]}
