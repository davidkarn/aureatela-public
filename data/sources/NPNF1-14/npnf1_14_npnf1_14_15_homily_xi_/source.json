What then is it that I require of you? That each of you take in hand that section of the Gospels which is to be read among you on the first day of the week, or even on the Sabbath, and before the day arrive, that he sit down at home and read it through, and often carefully consider its contents, and examine all its parts well, what[fn-6-P620_189330:1-nf] is deal what obscure,[fn-6-P621_189393:2-nf] what seems to make for the adversaries,[fn-6-P622_189454:3-nf] but does not really so; and when you have tried,[fn-6-P623_189533:4-nf] in a word[fn-6-P624_189591:5-nf] every point, so go to hear it read. For from zeal like this will be no small gain both to you and to us. We shall not need much labor to render dear the meaning of what is said, because your minds will be already made familiar with the sense of the words, and you will become keener and more clear-sighted not for hearing only, nor for learning, but also for the teaching of others. Since, in the way that now most of those who come hither hear, competed to take in the meaning of all at once, both the words, and the remarks we make upon them, they will not, though we should go on doing this for a whole year, reap any great gain. How can they, when they have leisure for what is said as a by work,[fn-6-P625_190304:6-nf] and only in this place, and for this short time? If any lay the fault on business, and cares, and constant occupation in public and private matters, in the first place, this is no slight charge in itself, that they are surrounded with such a multitude of business, are so continually nailed to the things of this life, that they cannot find even a little leisure for what is more needful than all Besides, that this is a mere pretext and excuse, their meetings with friends would prove against them, their loitering in the theaters, and the parties[fn-6-P626_190871:7-nf] they make to see horse races, at which they often spend whole days, yet never in that case does one of them complain of the pressure of business. For trifles then you can without making any excuses, always find abundant leisure; but when you ought to attend to the things of God, do these seem to you so utterly superfluous and mean, that you think you need not assign even a little leisure to them? How do men of such disposition deserve to breathe or to look upon this sun?","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"6","code":"P620_189330","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"let him mark what is clear, &c.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"6","code":"P621_189393","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"very plain.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"6","code":"P622_189454","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"to be contradictory.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"6","code":"P623_189533","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"diakwdwni/santej, \"having tried by ringing.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"6","code":"P624_189591","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"a9plw=j.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"6","code":"P625_190304","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"e0k pare/rgou.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"6","code":"P626_190871","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"sune/dria.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"There is another most foolish excuse of these sluggards; that they have not the books in their possession.

Or if any should stay, they are no better disposed than those who have retired, since they are only present here with us in body.

It is that \"the Word became Flesh,\" that the Master took on Him the form of a servant. For He became Son of man, who was God's own[fn-6-P636_193297:13-nf] Son, in order that He might make the sons of men to be children of God. For the high when it associates with the low touches not at all its own honor, while it raises up the other from its excessive lowness; and even thus it was with the Lord. He in nothing diminished His own Nature by this condescension,[fn-6-P637_193620:14-nf] but raised us, who had always sat in disgrace and darkness, to glory unspeakable. Thus it may be, a king, conversing with interest and kindness with a poor mean man, does not at all shame himself, yet makes the other observed by all and illustrious. Now if in the case of the adventitious dignity of men, intercourse with the humbler person in nothing injuries the more honorable, much less can it do so in the case of that simple and blessed Essence which has nothing adventitious, or subject to growth or decay, but has[fn-6-P638_194162:15-nf] all good things immovable, and fixed for ever. So that when you hear that \"the Word became Flesh,\" be not disturbed nor cast down, For that Essence did not change[fn-6-P639_194347:16-nf] to flesh, (it is impiety[fn-6-P640_194419:17-nf] to imagine this,) but continuing what it is, It so took upon It the form of a servant.","index":"7","references":[{"fn":"6","code":"P636_193297","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"gnh/sioj.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"6","code":"P637_193620","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"descent.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"6","code":"P638_194162","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"possesses.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"6","code":"P639_194347","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"mete/pesen, \"fall from what It was into.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"6","code":"P640_194419","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"truly impious.\"","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"[2.] Wherefore then does he use the expression, \"was made\"?

For as when (Paul) says, \"Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us,\" he does not mean that His essence removing from Its proper glory took upon It the being[fn-6-P643_195348:19-nf] of an accused thing, (this not even devils could imagine, nor even the very foolish, nor those deprived of their natural understanding, such impiety as well as madness does it contain,) as (St. Paul) does not say this, but that He, taking upon Himself the curse pronounced against us, leaves us no more under the curse; so also here he (St. John) says that He \"was made Flesh,\" not by changing His Essence to flesh, but by taking flesh to Himself, His Essence remained untouched.","index":"8","references":[{"fn":"6","code":"P642_194652","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"The Docetae, who maintained that our Lord appeared only to act and suffer in the Flesh, and that His Body was a phantom.

But if He admit of change, change for the worse, how could He be God? for change is far from that simple Nature. Wherefore the Prophet saith, \"They all shall wax old as doth a garment, and as a vesture shalt Thou roll them up, and they shall be changed; but Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail.\" (Ps. cii. 27, Ps. cii. 27 LXX.) For that Essence is superior to all change. There is nothing better than He, to which He might advance and reach. Better do I say? No, nor equal to, nor the least approaching Him. It remains, therefore, that if He change, He must admit a change for the worse; and this would not be God. But let the blasphemy return upon the heads of those who utter it. Nay, to show that he uses the expression,'\" was made\" only that you should not suppose a mere appearance, hear from what follows how he clears the argument, and overthrows that wicked suggestion. For what does he add? \"And dwelt among us.\" All but saying, \"Imagine nothing improper from the word `was made'; I spoke not of any change of that unchangeable Nature, but of Its dwelling[fn-6-P646_197122:21-nf] and in habiting.

And observe I pray you, the awful and ineffable nature[fn-6-P653_198213:27-nf] of the mystery. He inhabits this tabernacle for ever, for He clothed Himself with our flesh, not as again to leave it, but always to have it with Him. Had not this been the case, He would not have deemed it worthy of the royal throne, nor would He while wearing it have been worshiped by all the host of heaven, angels archangel, thrones, principalities, dominions, powers. What word, what though can represent such great honor done to our race, so truly marvelous and awful? What angel what archangel? Not one in any place, whether in heaven, or upon earth.
