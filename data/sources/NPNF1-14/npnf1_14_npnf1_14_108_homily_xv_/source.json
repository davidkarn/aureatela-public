Our affairs,[fn-63-P6321_2128163:42-nf] both our business[fn-63-P6322_2128201:43-nf] and our politeness, are turned into laughing; there is nothing steady, nothing grave. I say not these things to men of the world only; but I know those whom I am hinting at. For the Church has been filled with laughter. Whatever clever thing one may say, immediately there is laughter among those present: and the marvelous thing is that many do not leave off laughing even during the very time of the prayer.","index":"37","references":[{"fn":"63","code":"P6321_2128163","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"ta\\ h9mete/ra.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"63","code":"P6322_2128201","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"politismo\\j.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"Everywhere the devil leads the dance,[fn-63-P6324_2128667:44-nf] he has entered into all, is master of all.

Nowhere: but that He was sad indeed oftentimes.

If he who grieves not over the sins of others deserves to be accused, of what consideration will he be worthy, who is without sorrow for his own sins, yea laughs at them? This is the season of grief and tribulation, of bruising and bringing matter [the body], of conflicts and sweatings, and dost thou laugh?

There is no harm in laughter; the harm is when it is beyond measure, and out of season. Laughter has been implanted in us, that when we see our friends after a long time, we may laugh; that when we see any persons downcast and fearful, we may relieve them by our smile; not that we should burst out violently[fn-63-P6329_2131944:45-nf] and be always laughing. Laughter has been implanted in our soul, that the soul may sometimes be refreshed, not that it may be quite relaxed. For carnal desire also is implanted in us, and yet it is not by any means necessary that because it is implanted in us, therefore we should use it, or use it immoderately: but we should hold it in subjection, and not say, Because it is implanted in us, let us use it.","index":"42","references":[{"fn":"63","code":"P6329_2131944","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"a0nakagxa/zwmen.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"Serve God with tears, that thou mayest be able to wash away your sins.
