For if one reckon our desert, we were not only unworthy of the gift, but also liable to punishment and vengeance; but He, because He looked not to this, not only delivered us from punishment, but freely gave us a life much more bright[fn-13-P1369_458429:1-nf] than the first, introduced us into another world, made us another creature; \"If any man be in Christ,\" saith Paul, \"he is a new creature.\" (2 Cor. v. 17.) What kind of \"new creature\"? Hear Christ Himself declare; \"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.\" Paradise was entrusted to us, and we were shown unworthy to dwell even there, yet He hath exalted us to heaven. In the first things we were found unfaithful, and He hath committed to us greater; we could not refrain from a single tree, and He hath provided for us the delights[fn-13-P1370_459030:2-nf] above; we kept not our place in Paradise, and He hath opened to us the doors of heaven. Well said Paul, \"O the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!\" (Rom. xi. 33.) There is no longer a mother, or pangs, or sleep, or coming together, and embracings of bodies; henceforth all the fabric[fn-13-P1371_459352:3-nf] of our nature is framed above, of the Holy Ghost and water. The water is employed, being made the Birth to him who is born; what the womb is to the embryo, the water is to the believer; for in the water he is fashioned and formed. At first it was said, \"Let the waters bring forth the creeping things that have life\" (Gen. i. 20, Gen. i. 20 LXX.); but from the time that the Lord entered the streams of Jordan, the water no longer gives forth the \"creeping thing that hath life,\" but reasonable and Spirit-bearing souls; and what has been said of the sun, that he is \"as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber\" (Ps. xviii. 6), we may now rather say of the faithful, for they send forth rays far brighter than he. That which is fashioned in the womb requires time, not so that in water, but all is done in a single moment. Here our life is perishable, and takes its origin from the decay of other bodies; that which is to be born comes slowly, (for such is the nature of bodies, they acquire perfection by time,) but it is not so with spiritual things. And why? Because the things made are formed perfect from the beginning.","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"13","code":"P1369_458429","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"precious.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"13","code":"P1370_459030","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"trufh\\n.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"13","code":"P1371_459352","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"kataskeuh;.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"When Nicodemus still hearing these things was troubled, see how Christ partly opens to him the secret of this mystery, and makes that clear which was for a while obscure to him. \"That which is born,\" saith He, \"of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.\" He leads him away from all the things of sense. i and suffers him not vainly to pry into the mysteries revealed with his fleshly eyes; \"We speak not,\" saith He, \"of flesh, but of Spirit, O Nicodemus,\" (by this word He directs him heavenward for a while,) \"seek then nothing relating to things of sense; never can the Spirit appear to those eyes, think not that the Spirit bringeth forth the flesh.\" \"How then,\" perhaps one may ask, \"was the Flesh of the Lord brought forth?\" Not of the Spirit only, but of flesh; as Paul declares, when he says, \"Made of a woman, made under the Law\" (Gal iv. 4); for the Spirit fashioned Him not indeed out of nothing, (for what need was there then of a womb?) but from the flesh of a Virgin. How, I cannot explain unto you; yet it was done, that no one might suppose that what was born is alien to our nature.

Now if the Son is so born also, in what shall He be superior to men so born? And how is He, Only-begotten?

If then you do not complain because you cannot see this body, and do not on this account disbelieve, why do you, when you hear of \"the Spirit,\" hesitate and demand such exact accounts, although you act not so in the case of a body? What then doth Nicodemus? still he continues in his low Jewish opinion, and that too when so clear an example has been mentioned to him.

For the first-created man, and the woman formed from his side, and the barren women, and the things accomplished by water, I mean what relates to the fountain on which Elisha made the iron tool to swim, to the Red Sea which the Jews passed over, to the pool which the Angel troubled, to Naaman the Syrian who was cleansed in Jordan, all these proclaimed beforehand, as by a figure, the Birth and the purification which were to be. And the words of the Prophet allude to the manner of this Birth, as, \"It shall be announced unto the Lord a generation which cometh, and they shall announce His righteousness unto a people that shall be born, whom the Lord hath made\" (Ps. xxii. 30; xxx. 31 LXX.); and, \"Thy youth shall be renewed as an eagle's\" (Ps. ciii. 5, Ps. ciii. 5 LXX.); and, \"Shine, O Jerusalem; behold, Thy King cometh!\" (Isa. lx. 1; Zech. ix. 9); and, \"Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven.\" ( Ps. xxxii. 1, Ps. xxxii. 1 LXX.) Isaac also was a type of this Birth. For tell me, Nicodemus, how was he born? was it according to the law of nature? By no means; the mode of his generation was midway between this of which we speak and the natural; the natural, because he was begotten by cohabitation; the other, because he was begotten not of blood,[fn-13-P1391_467765:10-nf] (but by the will of God.) I shall show that these figures[fn-13-P1392_467861:11-nf] proclaimed beforehand not only this birth, but also that from the Virgin. For, because no one would easily have believed that a virgin could bear a child, barren women first did so, then such as were not only barren, but aged also. That a woman should be made from a rib was indeed far more wonderful than that the barren should conceive; but because that was of early and old time, another figure, new and fresh, was given, that of the barren women; to prepare the way for belief in the Virgin's travail.

And that this is so, and that He desires to establish nothing else, and refers not to sensual vision, is clear from this; after saying, \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit,\" He adds, \"We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen.\" Now this (of the Spirit) was not yet born[fn-13-P1397_469466:13-nf] ; how then saith He, \"what we have seen\"?

Wherefore we must abstain from anger, and make our words in every way credible by avoiding not only wrath, but also loud speaking[fn-13-P1399_470495:14-nf] for loud speaking is the fuel of passion.","index":"20","references":[{"fn":"13","code":"P1399_470495","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"lit. \"shouting.\"","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"Let us then bind[fn-14-P1401_470575:15-nf] the horse, that we may subdue the rider; let us clip the wings of our wrath, so the evil shall no more rise to a height. A keen passion is anger, keen, and skillful to steal our souls; therefore we must on all sides guard against its entrance. It were strange that we should be able to tame wild beasts, and yet should neglect our own savage minds. Wrath is a fierce fire, it devours all things; it harms the body, it destroys the soul, it makes a man deformed[fn-14-P1402_471065:16-nf] and ugly to look upon; and if it were possible for an angry person to be visible to himself at the time of his anger, he would need no other admonition, for nothing is more displeasing than an angry countenance. Anger is a kind of drunkenness, or rather it is more grievous than drunkenness, and more pitiable than (possession of) a daemon. But if we be careful not to be Bud in speech,[fn-14-P1403_471475:17-nf] we shall find this the best path to sobriety of conduct.[fn-14-P1404_471547:18-nf] And therefore Paul would take away clamor as well as anger, when he says, \"Let all anger and clamor be put away from you.\" (Eph. iv. 31.) Let us then obey this teacher of all wisdom, and when we are wroth with our servants, let us consider our own trespasses, and be ashamed at their forbearance. For when thou art insolent, and thy servant bears thy insults in silence, when thou actest unseemly, he like a wise man, take this instead of any other warning. Though he is thy servant, he is still a man, has an immortal soul, and has been honored with the same gifts as thee by your common Lord. And if he who is our equal in more important and more spiritual things, on account of some poor and trifling human superiority so meekly bears our injuries, what pardon can we deserve, what excuse can we make, who cannot, or rather will not, be as wise through fear of God, as he is through fear of us? Considering then all these things, and calling to mind Our own transgressions, and the common nature of man, let us be careful at all times to speak gently, that being humble in hear we may find rest for our souls, both that which now is, and that which is to come; which may we all attain, by the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, for ever and ever Amen.","index":"21","references":[{"fn":"14","code":"P1401_470575","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"lit. \"tie the feet of.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1402_471065","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"or, \"unpleasing.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1403_471475","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"kra/zein.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1404_471547","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"filosofi/an.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"","index":"22","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"23","references":[]}]}]}
