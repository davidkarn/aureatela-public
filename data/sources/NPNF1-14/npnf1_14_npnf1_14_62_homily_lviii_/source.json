Since even now in this place one might with show of reason question, how, when they had asserted, \"This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the Sabbath,\" they now say to the man, \"What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes?\" and not, \"What sayest thou of him, that he hath broken the Sabbath?\" but put now that which was the ground of the defense, not that of the accusation. What then have we to reply? That these (who speak) are not the men who said, \"This man is not of God,\" but those who separated themselves from them, who also said, \"A man that is a sinner cannot[fn-31-P3124_1056163:1-nf] do such miracles.\" For desiring to silence their opponents the more, in order that they may not seem to be partisans of Christ, they bring forward theman who had received proof of His power, and question him. Observe now the wisdom of thepoor man, he speaketh more wisely than themall. First he saith, \"He is a Prophet\"; and shrank not from the judgment[fn-31-P3125_1056548:2-nf] of the perverse Jews who spake against Him and said, \"How can this man be of God, not keeping the Sabbath?\" but replied to them, \"He is a Prophet.\"","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"31","code":"P3124_1056163","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"\"How can a man,\" &c., N.

But this isthe nature of truth, by the very means by whichit seems to be assailed by men, by these itbecomes stronger, it shines by means of that bywhich it is obscured. For if these things had not taken place, the miracle might have been suspected by the many; but now, as if desiring to lay bare the truth, so do they use all means, and would not have acted otherwise, supposing they had done all in Christ's behalf. For they first attempted to cast Him down by occasion of this mode (of cure), saying, \"How opened he thine eyes?\" that is, \"was it by some sorcery?\" In another place also, when they had no charge to bring against Him, they endeavored to insult the mode of the cure, saying, \"He doth not cast out devils save by Beelzebub.\" (Matt. xii. 24.) And here again, when they have nothing to say, they betake themselves to the time (of cure), saying, \"He breaketh the Sabbath\"; and again, \"He is a sinner.\" Yet He asked you, who would slay[fn-31-P3130_1057923:5-nf] Him, and who were ready to lay hold of His actions, most plainly, saying, \"Which of you convinceth Me of sin?\" (c. viii. 46); and no man spake, nor said \"Thou blasphemest because thou makest thyself without sin.\" But if they had had it in their power to say so, they would not have held their peace. For they who because they heard that He was before Abraham would have stoned Him, and said that He was not of God, who boasted that they, murderers as they were, were of God, but who said that One who did such wonders, after that He had wrought a cure, was not of God,[fn-31-P3131_1058513:6-nf] because He kept not the Sabbath, if they had had but a shadow of a charge against Him, would never have let it pass. And if they call Him a sinner because He seemed to break the Sabbath, this charge also is shown to be unsound, when those who are ranked with them condemn their great coldness and littleness of soul.[fn-31-P3132_1058853:7-nf] Being therefore entangled on every side, they afterwards betake themselves to something else more shameless and impudent. What is that? They \"did not believe,\" It saith, \"that he had been blind, and received his sight.\" How then did they charge Christ with not keeping the Sabbath? Plainly, as having believed. But why gave ye not heed to the great number of people? to the neighbors who knew him? As I said, falsehood everywhere defeats itself by the very means by which it seems to annoy the truth, and makes the truth to appear more bright. Which was now the case. For that no one might say that his neighbors and those who had seen him did not speak with precision, but guessed from a likeness,[fn-31-P3133_1059672:8-nf] they bring forward his parents, by whom they succeeded against their will in proving that what had taken place was real,[fn-31-P3134_1059822:9-nf] since the parents best of all knew their own child. When they could not terrify the man himself, but beheld him with all boldness proclaim his Benefactor, they thought to wound the miracle by means of his parents. Observe the malice of their questioning. For what saith it? Having placed them in the midst so as to throw them into distress,[fn-31-P3135_1060206:10-nf] they apply the questioning with great severity and anger,","index":"5","references":[{"fn":"31","code":"P3130_1057923","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"who envied.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"31","code":"P3131_1058513","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"was a sinner.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"31","code":"P3132_1058853","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"mikroyuxi/an.

And we shall be ableto do this, if we are bold,[fn-31-P3197_1073365:35-nf] and give heed to the Scriptures, and hear them not carelessly. For if one should come in here regularly, even though he read not at home, if he attends to what is said here, one year even is sufficient tomake him well versed in them; because we do not to-day read one kind of Scriptures, and tomorrow another, but always and continually the same. Still such is the wretched disposition of the many, that after so much reading, they do not even know the names of the Books, and are not ashamed nor tremble at entering so carelessly into a place where they may hear God's word. Yet if a harper, or dancer, or stage-player call the city, they all run eagerly, and feel obliged to him for the call, and spend the half of an entire day in attending to him alone; but when God speaketh to us by Prophets and Apostles, we yawn, we scratch ourselves, we are drowsy. And in summer, the heat seems too great, and we betake ourselves to the market place; and again, in winter, the rain and mire are a hindrance, and we sit at home; yet at horse races, though there is no roof over them to keep off the wet, the greater number, while heavy[fn-31-P3198_1074530:36-nf] rains are falling, and the wind is dashing the water into their faces, stand like madmen, caring not for cold, and wet, and mud, and length of way, and nothing either keeps them at home, or prevents their going thither. But here, where there are roofs over head, and where the warmth is admirable, they hold back instead of running together; and this too, when the gain is that of their own souls. How is this tolerable, tell me? Thus it happens, that while we are more skilled than any in those matters, in things necessary we are more ignorant than children. If a man call you a charioteer, or a dancer, you say that you have been insulted, and use every means to wipe off the affront; but if he draw you to be a spectator of the action, you do not start away, and the art whose name you shun, you almost in every case pursue. But where you ought[fn-31-P3199_1075410:37-nf] to have both the action and the name, both to be and to be called a Christian, you do not even know what kind of thing the action is. What can be worse than this folly?[fn-32-P3200_1075598:38-nf] These things I have desired continually to say to you, but I fear lest I gain hatred in vain and unprofitably. For I perceive that not only the young are mad, but the old also; about whom I am especially ashamed, when I see a man venerable from his white hairs, disgracing those white hairs, and drawing a child after him. What is worse than this mockery? What more shameful than this conduct? The child is taught by the father to act unseemly.","index":"42","references":[{"fn":"31","code":"P3197_1073365","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"i.e. through a good conscience.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"31","code":"P3198_1074530","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"heavy and violent.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"31","code":"P3199_1075410","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"desire.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"32","code":"P3200_1075598","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"lawlessness.\"","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"[5.] Do the words sting? This is what I desire, that you should suffer the pain caused by the words, in order to be delivered from the disgrace caused by the actions. For there are some too far colder than these, who are not even ashamed at the things spoken of, nay, who even put together[fn-32-P3202_1076356:39-nf] a long argument in defense of the action. If you ask them who was Amos or Obadiah, or what is the number of the Prophets or Apostles, they cannot even open their mouth but for horses and charioteers, they compose excuses more cleverly than sophists or rhetoricians, and after all this, they say, \"What is the harm? what is the loss?\" This is what I groan for, that ye do not so much as know that the action is a loss, nor have a sense of its evils. God hath given to thee an appointed space of life for serving Him, and dost thou while thou spendest it vainly, and at random, and on nothing useful, still ask, \"What loss is there?\" If thou hast spent a little money to no purpose, thou callest it a loss: when thou spendest whole days of thine upon the devil's pageants, thinkest thou that thou art doing nothing wrong? Thou oughtest to spend all thy life in supplications[fn-32-P3203_1077309:40-nf] and prayers, whereas thou wastest thy life and substance[fn-32-P3204_1077389:41-nf] heedlessly, and to thine own hurt, on shouts, and uproar, and shameful words, and fighting, and unseasonable pleasure, and actions performed by trickery, and after all this thou askest, \"What is the loss?\" not knowing thou shouldest be lavish of anything rather than time.[fn-32-P3205_1077674:42-nf] Gold, if thou shalt have spent, thou mayest get again; but if thou lose time, thou shall hardly recover that. Little is dealt out to us in this present life; if therefore we employ it not as we ought, what shall we say when we depart \"there\"? For tell me, if thou hadst commanded one of thy sons to learn some art, and then he had continually stayed at home, or even passed his time somewhere else, would not the teacher reject him? Would he not say to thee, \"Thou hast made an agreement with me, and appointed a time; if now thy son will not spend this time with me but in other places, how shall I produce him to thee as a scholar?\"[fn-32-P3206_1078408:43-nf] Thus also we must speak. For God will say also to us, \"I gave you time to learn this art of piety, wherefore have ye foolishly and uselessly wasted that time? Why did ye neither go constantly to the teacher, nor give heed to his words?\" For to show that piety is an art, hear what the Prophet saith, \"Come, ye children, hearken unto me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord.\" (Ps. xxxiv. 11.) And again, \"Blessed is the man whom Thou instructest, Lord, and teachest him out of Thy Law.\" (Ps. xciv. 12.) When therefore thou hast spent this time in vain, what excuse wilt thou have? \"And why,\" saith some one, \"did He deal out to us but little time?\" O senselessness and ingratitude! That for which thou wert most bounden to give thanks to Him, for that He hath cut short thy labors and abridged thy toils, and made the rest long and everlasting, for this dost thou find fault, and art discontented?","index":"43","references":[{"fn":"32","code":"P3202_1076356","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"are not even ashamed at what takes place at the theaters, but raise.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"32","code":"P3203_1077309","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"alms-deeds.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"32","code":"P3204_1077389","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"bi/on.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"32","code":"P3205_1077674","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"that thou wilt rather have required of thee the husbandry of time than any other thing.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"32","code":"P3206_1078408","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"an artist.\"","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"But I know not how we have brought our discourse to this point, and have made it so long; we must therefore shorten it now.

Nor is it \"there\" alone that ye shall receive your reward, but \"here\" also ye shall enjoy pure pleasure. Such a thing is virtue; besides giving us crowns in heaven, even here it maketh life pleasant to us.
