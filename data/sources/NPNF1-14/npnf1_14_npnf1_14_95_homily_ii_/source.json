And having said, \"whom He appointed heir of all things,\" and that \"by Him He made the worlds,\" he then adds, \"and upholding all things by the word of His power.\" For He that by a word only governs all things, could not be in need of any one, for the producing all things.","index":"10","references":[]},{"text":"[2.] And to prove this, mark how again going forward, and laying aside the \"by whom,\" he assigns to Him absolute power. For after he had effected what he wished by the use of it, thenceforward leaving it, what saith he? \"Thou Lord in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of Thine hands.\" (Infra, ver. 10.) Nowhere is there the saying \"by whom,\" or that \"by Him He made the worlds.\" What then? Were they not made by Him? Yes, but not, as thou sayest or imaginest, \"as by an instrument\": nor as though He would not have made them unless the Father had reached out a hand to Him. For as He \"judgeth no man\" (John v. 22), and is said to judge by the Son, in that He begat Him a judge; so also, to create by Him, in that He begat Him a Creator. And if the Father be the original cause of Him, in that He is Father, much more of the things which have been made by Him. When therefore he would show that He is of Him, he speaks of necessity lowly things. But when he would utter high things, Marcellus takes a handle, and Sabellius; avoiding however the excess of both, he holds a middle [way]. For neither does he dwell on the humiliation, lest Paul of Samosata should obtain a standing place, nor yet does he for ever abide in the high sayings; but shows on the contrary His abundant nearness, lest Sabellius rush in upon him. He names Him \"Son,\" and immediately Paul of Samosata comes on him, saying that He is a son, as the many are. But he gives him a fatal wound, calling Him \"Heir.\" But yet, with Arius, he is shameless. For the saying, \"He appointed Him heir,\" they both hold: the former one saying, it comes of weakness; the other still presses objections, endeavoring to support himself by the clause which follows. For by saying, \"by whom also He made the worlds,\" he strikes backwards the impudent Samosatene: while Arius still seems to be strong. Nevertheless see how he smites him likewise, saying again, \"who being the brightness of His glory.\" But behold! Sabellius again springs on us, with Marcellus, and Photinus: but on all these also he inflicts one blow, saying, \"and the express image of His person and upholding all things by the word of His power.\" Here again he wounds Marcion too;[fn-53-P5393_1752963:17-nf] not very severely, but however he doth wound him.

Therefore he [the Apostle] uses the word \"brightness,\" showing that this was said in the sense of \"Light of Light.\" Nor is it this alone which he shows, but also that He hath enlightened our souls; and He hath Himself manifested the Father, and by \"the brightness\" he has indicated the nearness of the Being [of the Father and the Son[fn-53-P5395_1753650:18-nf] ]. Observe the subtlety of his expressions. He hath taken one essence and subsistence to indicate two subsistences. Which he also doth in regard to the knowledge of the Spirit[fn-53-P5396_1754096:19-nf] ; for as he saith that the knowledge of the Father is one with that of the Spirit, as being indeed one, and in nought varying from itself (1 Cor. ii. 10-12): so also here he hath taken hold of one certain [thing] whereby to express the subsistence of the Two.[fn-53-P5397_1754375:20-nf] And he adds that He is \"the express Image.\" For the \"express Image\"is something other[fn-53-P5398_1754813:21-nf] than its Prototype: yet not Another in all respects, but as to having real subsistence. Since here also the term, \"express image,\" indicates there is no variation from that whereof it is the \"express image\": its similarity in all respects. When therefore he calls Him both Form,[fn-53-P5399_1755109:22-nf] and express Image, what can they say? \"Yea,\" saith he, \"man is also called an Image of God.\"[fn-54-P5400_1755231:23-nf] What then! is he so [an image of Him] as the Son is? No (saith he) but because the term,image, doth not show resemblance. And yet, in that man is called an Image, it showeth resemblance, as in man. For what God is in Heaven, that man is on earth, I mean as to dominion. And as he hath power over all things on earth, so also hath God power over, all things which are in heaven and which are on earth. But otherwise, man is not called \"Expressimage,\" he is not called Form: which phrase declares the substance, or rather both substance and similarity in substance. Therefore just as \"the form of a slave\" (Phil. ii. 6, Phil. ii. 7) expresses no other thing than a man without variation[fn-54-P5401_1755967:24-nf] [from human nature], so also \"the form of God\" expresses no other thing than God.","index":"12","references":[{"fn":"53","code":"P5395_1753650","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"kai dia\\ tou= a0pauga/smatoj th=j ou0si/aj th\\n e0ggu/thta e@deicen.

For tell me, if any man sick of a fever should drink much water, which for a short space indeed quencheth his thirst, but afterwards kindleth the flame, ought he to be high-minded? And what, if any man have many cares without cause, ought he therefore to be high-minded? tell me, wherefore? because thou hast many masters? because thou hast ten thousand cares? because many will flatter thee? [Surely not.] For thou art even their slave. And to prove that to thee, hear plainly. The other affections which are within us, are in some cases useful. For instance, Anger is often useful. For (saith he) \"unjust wrath shall not be innocent\" (Ecclus. i. 22): wherefore it is possible for one to be justly in wrath. And again, \"He that is angry with his brother without cause,[fn-54-P5421_1767101:31-nf] shall be in danger of hell.\" (Matt. v. 22.) Again for instance, emulation, desire, [are useful]: the one when it hath reference to the procreation of children, the other when he directs his emulation to excellent things. As Paul also saith, \"It is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing\" (Gal. iv. 18) and, \"Covet earnestly the best gifts.\" (1 Cor. xii. 31.) Both therefore are useful: but an insolent spirit is in no case good, but is always unprofitable and hurtful.","index":"25","references":[{"fn":"54","code":"P5421_1767101","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"St. Chrys. here follows a text having the gloss ei0kh= now rejected by nearly all critical editors.-F.

Because he who can live upon a little, is far greater and better than he who cannot. For tell me, supposing certain persons called to the Imperial City, if some of them should need neither beasts, nor slaves, nor umbrellas, nor lodging-places, nor sandals, nor vessels, but it should suffice them to have bread, and to take water from the wells,-while others of them should say, \"unless ye give us conveyances, and a soft bed, we cannot come; unless also we have many followers, unless we may be allowed continually to rest ourselves, we cannot come, nor unless we have the use of beasts, unless too we may travel but a small portion of the day-and we have need of many other things also\": whom should we admire? those or these? plainly, these who require nothing. So also here: some need many things for the journey through this life; others, nothing. So that it would be more fitting to be proud, for poverty if it were fitting at all.","index":"26","references":[]},{"text":"\"But the poor man,\" they say, \"is contemptible.\" Not he, but those who despise him. For why do not I despise those who know not how to admire what they ought? Why, if a person be a painter, he will laugh to scorn all who jeer at him, so long as they are uninstructed; nor cloth he regard the things which they say, but is content with his own testimony. And shall we depend on the opinion of the many? Therefore, we are worthy of contempt when men despise us for our poverty, and we do not despise them nor call them miserable.","index":"27","references":[]},{"text":"And I say not how many sins are produced by wealth, and how many good things by poverty. But rather, neither wealth nor poverty is excellent in itself, but through those who use it. The Christian shines out in poverty rather than in riches. How? He will be less arrogant, more sober-minded, graver, more equitable, more considerate: but he that is in wealth, hath many impediments to these things. Let us see then what the rich man does, or rather, he who useth his wealth amiss. Such an one practicethrapine, fraud, violence. Men's unseemly loves, unholy unions, witchcrafts, poisonings, all their other horrors,-wilt thou not find them produced by wealth? Seest thou, that in poverty rather than in wealth the pursuit of virtue is less laborious? For do not, I beseech thee, think that because rich men do not suffer punishment here, neither do they sin. Since if it were easy for a rich man to suffer punishment, thou wouldest surely have found the prisons filled with them. But among its other evils, wealth hath this also, that he who possesseth it, transgressing in evil with impunity, will never be staved from doing so, but will receive wounds without remedies, and no man will put a bridle on him.","index":"28","references":[]},{"text":"And if a man choose, he will find that poverty affords us more resources even for pleasure. How? Because it is freed from cares, hatred, fighting, contention, strife, from evils out of number.","index":"29","references":[]},{"text":"Therefore let us not follow after wealth, nor be forever envying those who possess much. But let those of us who have wealth, use it aright; and those who have not, let us not grieve for this, but give thanks for all things unto God, because He enableth us to receive with little labor the same reward with the rich, or even (if we will) a greater: and froth small means we shall have great gains. For so he that brought the two talents, was admired and honored equally with him who brought the five. Now why? Because he was entrusted with [but] two talents, yet he accomplished all that in him lay, and brought in what was entrusted to him, doubled. Why then are we eager to have much entrusted to us, when we may by a little reap the same fruits, or even greater? when the labor indeed is less, but the reward much more? For more easily will a poor man part with his own, than a rich man who hath many and great possessions. What, know ye not, that the more things a man hath, the more he setteth his love upon? Therefore, lest this befall us, let us not seek after wealth, nor let us be impatient of poverty, nor make haste to be rich: and let those of us who have [riches] so use them as Paul commanded. (\"They that have,\" saith he, \"as though they had not, and they that use this world as not abusing it\"-1 Cor. vii. 29, 1 Cor. vii. 31): that we may obtain the good things promised. And may it be granted to us all to obtain them, by the grace and love of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father together with the Holy Ghost, be glory, power, honor, now, and for ever, and world without end.
