Not for his sake alone do I wish this, he means, but also on account of the harm arising therefrom. That is to say, even if there be a root of this kind, do not suffer any shoot to come up, but let it be cut off, that it may not bear its proper fruits, that so it may not defile and pollute the others also.

For he also is a slave of a different pleasure. He is forced to be overreaching, he is forced to be rapacious, to behave himself unseemly in ten thousand ways, being the slave of that passion, and oftentimes he blasphemes. So he accounted \"his birthright\" to be nothing worth. That is, providing for temporary refreshment, he went even to the [sacrifice of his] \"birthright.\" So henceforth \"the birthright\" belongs to us, not to the Jews.

By no means. `But how, you say, was it that \"he found no place of repentance\"?' For if he condemned himself, if he made a great wailing, why did he \"find no place of repentance\"? Because it was not really a case of repentance. For as the grief of Cain was not of repentance, and the murder proved it; so also in this case, his words were not those of repentance, and the murder afterwards proved it. For even he also in intention slew Jacob. For \"The days of mourning for my father,\" he said, \"are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.\" (Gen. xxvii. 41.) \"Tears\" had not power to give him \"repentance.\" And [the Apostle] did not say \"by repentance\" simply, but even \"with tears, he found no place of repentance.\" Why now?

He seems to me to hint at some fornicators amongst them, but not to wish at that time to correct them: but feigns ignorance that they might correct themselves. For it is right at first indeed to pretend ignorance: but afterwards, when they continue [in sin], then to add reproof also, that so they may not become shameless.

So long as it is a matter of lameness, it is easy to become upright: but if we turn out of the way, what will be left? For it is to those who have not yet fallen that he thus discourses, striking them with terror, and says that it is not possible for him who is fallen to obtain consolation; but to those who have fallen, that they may not fall into despair, he says the contrary, speaking thus, \"My little children, of whom I travail in birth again, until Christ he formed in you.\" (Gal. iv. 19.) And again, \"Whosoever of you are justified by the Law, are fallen from Grace.\" (Gal. v. 4.) Lo! he testifies that they had fallen away. For he that standeth, hearing that it is not possible to obtain pardon after having fallen, will be more zealous, and more cautious about his standing: if however thou use the same violence towards one also who is fallen, he will never rise again.

For the Evangelist in relating to us the things concerning him, says, \"And he went out and wept bitterly.\" (Matt. xxvi. 75.) Therefore even such a sin was forgiven him, because he repented as he ought.

For since it was likely that he would be high-minded, being conscious to himself that he loved Christ more than they all, therefore \"he wept bitterly\"; and he did other things after his weeping, of the same character. For what did he do? After this he exposed himself to dangers innumerable, and by many means showed his manliness and courage.","index":"18","references":[]},{"text":"Judas also repented, but in an evil way: for he hanged himself.

The blessed David repented, thus saying, \"Every night will I wash my bed: I will water my conch with my tears.\" (Ps. vi. 6.)

If he considers these things, he will not be angry, he will not be indignant, but will mourn, will weep, will groan, and lament night and day.He that is penitent ought never to forget his sin, but on the one hand, to beseech God not to remember it; while on the other, he himself never forgets it. If we remember it, God will forget it. Let us exact punishment from ourselves; let us accuse ourselves; thus shall we propitiate the Judge. For sin confessed becomes less, but not confessed worse.

What then? When he heard,\"Adam, where art thou?\" (Gen. iii. 9), he said, \"I heard Thy voice, and I was afraid, because I am naked, and I hid myself.\" (Gen. iii. 10.)
