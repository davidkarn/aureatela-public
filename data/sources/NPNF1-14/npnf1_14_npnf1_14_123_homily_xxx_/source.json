How so? because in the latter case the expectation of coming despondency makes the present pleasure less: hut in the former the expectation of coming pleasure cuts away the violence of present despondency; so that the result is that in the one instance we never have pleasure, in the latter we never have grief. And the difference does not lie in this only, but also in other ways. As how? That the duration is not equal, but far greater and more ample.

For if the chastisement be of love, if it begin from loving care, if it end with a good result (and this he proves both by facts and by words, and by all considerations), why are ye dispirited? For such are they who despair, who are not strengthened by the hope of the future. \"Walk straight,\" he says, that your lameness may not be increased, but brought back to its former condition.

For nothing so especially makes persons easily vanquished and subdued in temptations, as isolation. For, tell me, scatter a phalanx in war, and the enemy will need no trouble, but will take them prisoners, coming on them separately, and thereby the more helpless.\"Follow peace with all men, and holiness\"[fn-72-P7212_2452169:8-nf] (he says). Therefore with the evil-doers as well? \"If it be possible,\" he says, \"as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.\" (Rom. xii. 18.) For thy part (he means) \"live peaceably,\" doing no harm to religion: but in whatever thou art ill-treated, bear it nobly. For the bearing with evil is a great weapon in trials. Thus Christ also made His disciples strong by saying, \"Behold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves,\" (Matt. x. 16.) What dost Thou say? Are we \"among wolves,\" and dost Thou bid us to be \"as sheep,\" and \"as doves\"? Yea, He says. For nothing so shames him that is doing us evil, as bearing nobly the things which are brought upon us: and not avenging ourselves either by word or by deed. This both makes us more philosophical ourselves and procures a greater reward, and also benefits them. But has such an one been insolent? Do thou bless [him]. See how much thou wilt gain from this: thou hast quenched the evil, thou hast procured to thyself a reward, thou hast made him ashamed, and thou hast suffered nothing serious.","index":"10","references":[{"fn":"72","code":"P7212_2452169","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"It is the same word as above and is rendered in the R.

If any person is unmarried (he says) let him remain pure, let him marry: or if he be married, let him not commit fornication, but let him live with his own wife: for this also is \"holiness.\" How? Marriage is not \"holiness,\" but marriage preserves the holiness which [proceeds] from Faith, not permitting union with a harlot. For \"marriage is honorable\" (c. xiii. 4), not holy. Marriage is pure: it does not however also give holiness, except by forbidding the defilement of that [holiness] which has been given by our Faith.","index":"11","references":[{"fn":"72","code":"P7214_2453481","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"\"sanctification,\" as 1 Thess. iv. 3, &c.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 thessalonians","chapter":4,"verses":[3]}]}]},{"text":"\"Without which\" (he says) \"no man shall see the Lord.\" Which he also says in the [Epistle] to the Corinthians. \"Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor adulterers, nor idolaters, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor covetous persons, nor thieves, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.\" (1 Cor. vi. 9, 10.)

Yea, I entreat you, let no man neglect it. For great is the reward he receives from God. And that thou mayest understand, he who was entrusted with the five talents is the teacher: and he with the one is the learner. If the learner should say, I am a learner, I run no risk, and should hide the reason,[fn-72-P7220_2456857:11-nf] which he received of God, that common and simple [reason], and give no advice, should not speak plainly, should not rebuke, should not admonish, if he is able, but should bury [his talents] in the earth (for truly that heart is earth and ashes, which hides the gift of God): if then he hides it either from indolence, or from wickedness, it will be no defense to him to say, `I had but one talent.' Thou hadst one talent. Thou oughtest then to have brought one besides, and to have doubled the talent. If thou hadst brought one in addition, thou wouldst not have been blamed. For neither did He say to him who brought the two, Wherefore hast thou not brought five? But He accounted him of the same worth with him who brought the five. Why? Because he gained as much as he had. And, because he had received fewer than the one entrusted with the five, he was not on this account negligent, nor did he use the smallness [of his trust, as an excuse] for idleness. And thou oughtest not to have looked to him who had the two; or rather, thou oughtest to have looked to him, and as he having two imitated him who had five, so oughtest thou to have emulated him who had two. For if for him who has means and does not give, there is punishment, how shall there not be the greatest punishment for him who is able to exhort in any way, and does it not?
