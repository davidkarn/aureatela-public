I mean such as the love of money. It is in truth of itself a dreadful malady, but it becomes much more grievous, because it is the root and mother of all mischiefs. Such also is vainglory. See, for instance, how these men were broken off from the faith through their love of honor. \"Many,\" it saith, \"of the chief rulers also believed on Him, but because of the Jews[fn-38-P3869_1294594:1-nf] they did not confess Him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue.\" As He said also to them before, \"How can ye believe which receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor that cometh from God only?\" (c. v. 44.) So then they were not rulers, but slaves in the utmost slavery. However, this fear was afterwards done away, for nowhere during the time of the Apostles do we find them possessed by this feeling, since in their time both rulers and priests believed. The grace of the Spirit having come, made them all firmer than adamant. Since therefore this was what hindered them from believing at this time, hear what He saith.","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"38","code":"P3869_1294594","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"\"Pharisees,\" N.

But that thou mightest learn that He speaketh here of the belief on His Essence, He said not, \"He that believeth My words,\" but, \"He that believeth on Me.\" \"And wherefore,\" saith some one, \"hath He nowhere said conversely, He that believeth on the Father, believeth not on the Father but on Me?\" Because they would have replied, \"Lo, we believe on the Father, but we believe not on thee.\" Their disposition was as yet too infirm. Anyhow, conversing with the disciples, He did speak thus: \"Ye believe on the Father,[fn-38-P3873_1296287:3-nf] believe also on Me\" (c. xiv. 1); but seeing that these then were too weak to hear such words, He leadeth them in another way, showing[fn-38-P3874_1296440:4-nf] that it is not possible to believe on the Father, without believing on Him.

What more than Jeremiah? for he too when he was sent was inspired. (Jer. i. 9.) What then Ezekiel? for he too, after eating the roll, so spake. (Ezek. iii. 1.) Otherwise also, they who were about to hear what He said shall be found to be causes of His knowledge.

How can this be reasonable? Seest thou not that He bringeth His expressions to an excess of humility, that He may both draw those men over, and silence those who should come after.

Hath He then power to quicken whom He will, and to say what He will hath He not power?

But when He saith, \"I judge not,\" He showeth that He is not the cause of the perdition of these men.[fn-38-P3895_1301534:14-nf] By this He all but plainly testifies, when about to remove from, and to be no more with, them, that \"I converse with you, speaking nothing as of Myself, but all as from the Father.\" And for this cause He confined His discourse to them to humble expressions, that He might say, \"Even until the end did I utter this, My last word, to them.\" What word was that? \"As the Father said unto Me, so I speak.\" \"Had I been opposed to God I should have said the contrary, that I speak nothing of what is pleasing to God, so as to attract the honor to Myself, but now I have so referred all things to Him, as to call nothing My own.[fn-38-P3896_1302202:15-nf] Why then do ye not believe Me when I say that `I have received a commandment,' and when I so vehemently remove your evil suspicion respecting rivalry? For as it is impossible for those who have received a commandment to do or say anything but what their senders wish, as long as they fulfill the commandment, and do not forge[fn-38-P3897_1302569:16-nf] anything; so neither is it possible for Me to say or do anything except as My Father willeth.

Through this we everywhere go beyond needful use;[fn-39-P3903_1303833:21-nf] through this arises extravagance in garments, and a great swarm of domestics; through this the needful use is everywhere despised, in our houses, our garments, our table; and extravagance prevails. Wilt thou enjoy glory? Do alms-deeds, then shall Angels praise thee, then shall God receive thee. Now the admiration goes no farther than the goldsmiths and weavers, and thou[fn-39-P3904_1304221:22-nf] departest without a crown, often seeing that thou receivest curses. But if thou put not these things about thy body, but expend them in feeding the poor, great will be the applause from all sides, great the praise. Then shall thou have them, when thou givest them to others; when thou keepest them to thyself, then thou hast them not. For a house is a faithless treasury, but a sure treasury are the hands of the poor. Why adornest thou thy body, while thy soul is neglected, possessed by uncleanness? Why bestowest thou not so much thought on thy soul, as thy body? Thou oughtest to bestow greater; but anyhow, beloved,[fn-39-P3905_1304867:23-nf] we ought to bestow equal care upon it. For tell me, if any one asked thee which thou wouldest choose, that thy body should be fresh and of good habit and surpassing in beauty, and wear mean raiment, or having the body deformed and full of diseases, to wear gold and finery; wouldest thou not much prefer to have beauty depending on the nature of thy person, than on the raiment with which thou art clothed? And wilt thou choose this in the case of thy body, but the contrary in the case of thy soul; and, when thou hast that ugly and unsightly and black, dost thou think to gain anything from golden ornaments? What madness is this! Shift this adorning within, put these necklaces about thy soul. The things that are put about thy body help neither to its health nor to its beauty, for it will not make black white, nor what is ugly either beautiful or good looking. But if thou put them about thy soul, thou shalt soon make it white instead of black, instead of ugly and unsightly, thou shalt make it beautiful and well-favored. The words are not mine, but those of the Lord Himself, who saith, \"Though thy sins be as scarlet, I will make them white as snow\" (Isa. i. 18, Isa. i. 18 LXX.); and, \"Give alms-and all things shall be clean unto you\" (Luke xi. 41); and by such a disposition thou shalt beautify not thyself only, but thy husband. For they if they see you putting off these outward ornaments, will have no great need of expense, and not having it, they will abstain from all covetousness, and will be more inclined to give alms, and ye too will be able boldly to give them fitting counsel. At present ye are deprived of all such authority. For with what mouth will ye speak of these things? with what eyes will ye look your husbands in the face, asking money for alms, when ye spend most upon the covering of your bodies? Then wilt thou be able boldly to speak with thy husband concerning alms-giving, when thou layest aside thine ornaments of gold. Even if thou accomplish nothing, thou hast fulfilled all thy part; but I should rather say, that it is impossible that the wife should not gain the husband, when she speaks by the very actions.[fn-39-P3906_1307069:24-nf] \"For what knowest thou, O woman, whether thou shalt save thy husband?\" (1 Cor. vii. 16.) As then now thou shall give account both for thyself and for him, so if thou put off all this vanity thou shall have a double crown, wearing thy crown and triumphing[fn-39-P3907_1307356:25-nf] with thy husband through those unalloyed[fn-39-P3908_1307415:26-nf] ages, and enjoying the everlasting good things, which may we all obtain, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever.
