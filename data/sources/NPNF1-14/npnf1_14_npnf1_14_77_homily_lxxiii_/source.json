And so the most fervent Peter, when he hears, \"Whither I go ye cannot come,\" what saith he? \"Lord, whither goest thou?\" and this he said, not so much from wish to learn, as from desire to follow. To say openly, \"I go,\" he dared not yet, but, \"Whither goest thou?\" Christ answered, not to his words, but to his thoughts. For that this was his wish, is clear from what Christ said, \"Whither I go thou canst not follow Me now.\" Seest thou that he longed for the following Him, and therefore asked the question? And when he heard, \"thou shalt follow Me afterwards,\" not even so did he restrain his longing, and, though he had gainedgood hopes, he is so eager as to say,","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"41","code":"P4117_1361914","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"a great good.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"41","code":"P4118_1362022","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"whence neither shall there be.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"41","code":"P4119_1362106","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"r9agdai=on.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"Ver. 37. \"Why cannot I follow Thee now?

He said, `thou canst not,' and thou sayest, `I can'? Therefore thou shalt know from this temptation that thy love is nothing without the presence of the impulse[fn-41-P4123_1363234:5-nf] from above.\" Whence it is clear that in care for him He allowed even that fall. He desired indeed to teach him even by the first words, but when he continued in his vehemence, He did not indeed throw or force him into the denial, but left him alone, that he might learn his own weakness. Christ had said that He must be betrayed; Peter replied, \"Be it far from Thee, Lord; this shall not happen unto Thee.\" (Matt. xvi. 22.) He was rebuked, but not instructed. On the contrary, when Christ desired to wash his feet, he said, \"Thou shall never wash my feet.\"[fn-41-P4124_1363803:6-nf] (Ver. 8.) Again, when he hears, \"Thou canst not follow Me now,\" he saith, \"Though all deny Thee, I will not deny Thee.\" Since then it was likely that he would be lifted up to folly by his practice of contradiction, Jesus next teacheth him not to oppose Him. This too Luke implies, when he telleth us that Christ said, \"And I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not\" (Luke xxii. 32); that is, \"that thou be not finally lost.\" In every way teaching him humility, and proving that human nature by itself is nothing. But, since great love made him apt for contradiction, He now sobereth him, that he might not in after times be subject to this, when he should have received the stewardship of the world, but remembering what he had suffered, might know himself. And look at the violence of his fall; it did not happen to him once or twice, but he was so beside himself, that in a short tithe thrice did he utter the words of denial, that he might learn that he did not so love as he was loved. And yet, to one who had so fallen He saith again, \"Lovest thou Me more than these?\" So that the denial was caused not by the cooling of his love, but from his having been stripped of aid from above. He accepteth then Peter's love, but cutteth off the spirit of contradiction engendered by it. \"For if thou lovest, thou oughtest to obey Him who is beloved. I said[fn-41-P4125_1365204:7-nf] to thee and to those with thee, `Thou canst not'; why art thou contentious? Knowest thou what a thing it is to contradict God? But since thou wilt not learn in this way that it is impossible that what I say should not come to pass, thou shalt learn[fn-41-P4126_1365481:8-nf] it in the denial.\" And yet this appeared to thee to be much more incredible. For this thou did, not even understand, but of that thou hadst the knowledge[fn-41-P4127_1365656:9-nf] in thy heart.

Why did He put in a circuit of so many words, placing together questions and answers? With good reason He told not this to the Jews; but why not to these?\" He had indeed said both to these and to the Jews, that He came forth from God, and was going to God, now He saith the same thing more clearly than before. Besides, to the Jews He spake not so clearly; for had He said, \"Ye cannot come to the Father but by Me,\" they would straightway hard deemed the matter mere boasting; but now by concealing this, He threw them[fn-41-P4157_1371039:22-nf] into perplexity. \"But why,\" saith some one, \"did He speak thus both to the disciples and to Peter?\" He knew his great forwardness, and that he would by reason of this[fn-41-P4158_1371240:23-nf] the more press on and trouble Him; in order therefore to lead him away, He hideth the matter. Having then succeeded in what He wished by the obscurity and by veiling His speech, He again discloseth the matter. After saying, \"Where I am, no man can come,\" He addeth, \"In My Father's house are many mansions\"; and again, \"No man cometh to the Father but by Me.\" This He would not tell them at first, in order not to throw them into greater despondency, but, now that He hath soothed them, He telleth them. For by Peter's rebuke He cast out[fn-41-P4159_1371809:24-nf] much of their despondency; and dreading lest they should beaddressed in the same way, they were the more restrained. \"I am the Way.\" This is the proof of the, \"No man cometh to the Father but by Me\";[fn-41-P4160_1372030:25-nf] and, \"the Truth, and the Life,\" of this, \"that these things shall surely be.\" \"There is then no falsehood with Me, if I am `the Truth'; if I am `Life' also, not even death shall be able to hinder you from coming to Me. Besides; if I am `the Way,' ye will need none to lead you by the hand; if I am also `the Truth,' My words are no falsehoods; if I am also `Life,' though ye die ye shall obtain what I have told you.\" Now His being \"the Way,\" they both understood and allowed, but the rest they knew not. They did not indeed venture to say what they knew not.

But first the font cleanseth, afterwards other ways also, many and of all kinds. For God, being merciful, hath even after this[fn-41-P4168_1374875:30-nf] given to us various ways of[fn-41-P4169_1374923:31-nf] reconciliation, of all which the first is that by alms-doing. \"By alms-deeds,\" it saith, \"and deeds of faith sins are cleansed away.\" (Ecclus. iii. 30.) By alms-doing I do not mean that which is maintained by injustice, for this is not alms-doing, but savageness and inhumanity. What profits it to strip one man and clothe another? For we ought to begin the action with mercy, but this is inhumanity. If we give away everything that we have got from other people, it is no gain to us. And this Zacchaeus shows, who on that occasion said, that he propitiated God by giving four times as much as he had taken. (Luke xix. 8.) But we, when we plunder unboundedly, and give but little, think that we make God propitious, whereas we do rather[fn-41-P4170_1375689:32-nf] exasperate Him. For tell me, if thou shouldest drag a dead and rotten ass from the waysides and lanes, and bring it to the altar, would not all stone thee as accursed and polluted?[fn-41-P4171_1375902:33-nf] Well then, if I prove that a sacrifice procured by plunder is more polluted than this, what defense shall we obtain? Let us suppose that some article has been obtained by plunder, is it not of fouler scent than a dead ass? Wouldest thou learn how great is the rottenness of sin? Hear the Prophet saying, \"My wounds stank, and were corrupt.\" (Ps. xxxviii. 5, Ps. xxxviii. 5 LXX.) And dost thou in words entreat God to forget thy misdeeds, and dost thou by what thou thyself doest, robbing and grasping, and placing thy sin upon the altar, cause Him to remember them continually? But now, this is not the only sin, but there is one more grievous than this, that thou defilest the souls of the saints.[fn-41-P4172_1376624:34-nf] For the altar is but a stone, and is consecrated, but they ever bear with them Christ Himself; and darest thou to send thither any of such impurity? \"No,\" saith one, \"not the same money, but other.\" Mockery this, and trifling. Knowest thou not, that if one drop of injustice fall on a great quantity of wealth, the whole is defiled? And just as a man by casting dung into a pure fountain makes it all unclean, so also in the case of riches, anything ill-gotten entering in makes them to be tainted with the ill savor from itself. Then we wash our hands when we enter into church, but our hearts not so. Why, do our hands send forth a voice? It is the soul that utters[fn-41-P4173_1377319:35-nf] the words: to that God looketh; cleanness of the body is of no use, while that is defiled. What profits it, if thou wipe clean thine outward hands, while thou hast those within impure? For the terrible thing and that which subverts all good is this, that while we are fearful about trifles, we care not for important matters. To pray with unwashed hands is a matter indifferent; but to do it with an unwashed mind, this is the extreme of all evils. Hear what was said to the Jews who busied themselves about such outward impurities. \"Wash thine heart from wickedness, how long shall there be in thee thoughts of thy labors?\"[fn-41-P4174_1377963:36-nf] (Jer. iv. 14.) Let us also wash ourselves, not with mire, but with fair water, with alms-doing, not with covetousness. First get free from rapine, and then show forth alms-deeds. Let us \"decline from evil, and do good.\" (Ps. xxxvii. 27.) Stay thy hands from covetousness, and so bring them to alms-giving. But if with the same hands we strip one set of persons,[fn-41-P4175_1378390:37-nf] though we may not clothe the others with what has been taken[fn-41-P4176_1378472:38-nf] from them, yet we shall not thus escape punishment. For that which is the groundwork[fn-41-P4177_1378575:39-nf] of the propitiation is made the groundwork of all wickedness. Better not show mercy, than show it thus; since for Cain also it had been better not to have[fn-41-P4178_1378746:40-nf] brought his offering at all. Now if he who brought too little angered God, when one gives what is another's, how shall not he anger Him? \"I commanded thee,\" He will say, \"not to steal, and honorest thou Me from that thou hast stolen? What thinkest thou? That I am pleased with these things?\" Then shall He say to thee, \"Thou thoughtest wickedly that I am even such an one as thyself; I will rebuke thee, and set before thy face thy sins.\" (Ps. l. 21, Ps. l. 21 LXX.) But may it not come to pass that any one of us hear this voice, but having wrought pure alms-deeds, and having our lamps burning, so may we enter into the bride-chamber by the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with the Father and the Holy Ghost[fn-41-P4179_1379537:41-nf] be glory for ever and ever.
