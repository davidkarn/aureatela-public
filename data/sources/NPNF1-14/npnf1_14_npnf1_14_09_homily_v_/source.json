For, \"In the beginning,\" he says, \"God made the heaven and the earth,\" and then he adds, that light was created, and a second heaven and the stars, the various kinds of living creatures, and, that we may not delay by going through particulars, everything else. But this Evangelist, cutting all short, includes both these things and the things which are above these in a single sentence; with reason, because they were known to his hearers, and because he is hastening to a greater subject, and has instituted all his treatise, that he might speak not of the works but of the Creator, and Him who produced them all. And therefore Moses, though he has selected the smaller portion of the creation, (for he has spoken nothing to us concerning the invisible powers,) dwells on these things;[fn-3-P386_104373:1-nf] while John, as hastening to ascend to the Creator Himself, runs by both these things, and those on which Moses was silent, having comprised them in one little saying, \"All things were made by Him.\" And that you may not think that he merely speaks of all the things mentioned by Moses, he adds, that \"without Him was not anything made that was made.\" That is to say, that of created things, not one, whether it be visible[fn-3-P387_104824:2-nf] or intelligible[fn-3-P388_104853:3-nf] was brought into being without the power of the Son.","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"3","code":"P386_104373","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"i.e. the visible creation.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"3","code":"P387_104824","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"o9rato\\n.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"3","code":"P388_104853","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"nohto\\n.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"For we will not put the full stop after \"not anything,\" as the heretics do.

Besides, we shall find by this argument, not that the Spirit, but that the Son Himself, is created by Himself. But rouse yourselves, that what is said may not escape you; and come, let us read for a while after their fashion, for so its absurdity will be clearer to us. \"What was made, in Him was Life.\" They say that the Spirit is called \"Life.\" But this \"Life\" is found to be also \"Light,\" for he adds, \"And the Life was the Light of men.\" (Ver. 4.) Therefore, according to them the \"Light of men\" here means the Spirit. Well, but when he goes on to say, that \"There was a man sent from God, to bear witness of that Light\" (vers. 6, 7), they needs must assert, that this too is spoken of the Spirit; for whom he above called \"Word,\" Him as he proceeds he calls \"God,\" and \"Life,\" and \"Light.\" This \"Word\" he says was \"Life,\" and this \"Life\" was \"Light.\" If now this Word was Life, and if this Word and this Life became flesh, then the Life, that is to say, the Word, \"was made flesh, and we beheld\" Its \"glory, the glory as of the Only-Begotten of the Father.\" If then they say that the Spirit is here called \"Life,\" consider what strange consequences will follow.

Then after some words between, he has added, \"And we beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-Begotten of the Father.\" (Ver. 14.)

And why do you wonder if we say this of the Father? We could not even say of the Comforter, that wherever \"Spirit\" (is mentioned), the Comforter is absolutely meant, and yet this is His most distinctive name; still not always where Spirit (is mentioned is) the Comforter (meant). Thus Christ is called \"the power of God\" (1 Cor. 1. 24), and \"the wisdom of God\"; yet not always where \"the power\" and \"the wisdom of God\" are mentioned is Christ meant; so in this passage, although the Spirit does give \"Light,\" yet the Evangelist is not now speaking of the Spirit.","index":"6","references":[]},{"text":"When we have shut them out from these strange opinions, they who take all manner of pains to withstand the truth, say, (still clinging to the same reading,) \"Whatever came into existence[fn-3-P394_108487:5-nf] by him was life, because,\" says one, \"whatever came into existence was life.\" What then do you say of the punishment of the men of Sodom, and the flood, and hell fire, and ten thousand like things? \"But,\" says one, \"we are speaking of the material creation.\"[fn-3-P395_108757:6-nf] Well, these too belong entirely to the material creation.

In this way they assert things by no means befitting of the Spirit. Being driven from their other ground, they apply those things to men, which they before thought to be spoken worthily of the Spirit. However, let us examine the reading itself this way also. The creature is now called \"life,\" therefore, the same is \"light,\" and John came to witness concerning it. Why then is not he also \"light\"? He says that \"he was not that light\" (ver. 8), and yet he belonged to created things? How then is he not \"light\"? How was he \"in the world, and the world was made by him\"? (Ver. 10.) Was the creature in the creature, and was the creature made by the creature? But how did \"the world know him not\"? How did the creature not know the creature? \"But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God.\" (Ver. 12.) But enough of laughter.

For if these things are neither said of the Spirit, (and it has been shown that they are not,) nor of anything created, and yet they still hold to the same reading, that stranger conclusion than any which we before mentioned, will follow, that the Son was made by Himself. For if the Son is the true Light, and this Light was Life, and this Life was made in Him, this must needs be the result according to their own reading.

See you how by this short addition he has rectified all the besetting[fn-4-P402_111237:11-nf] difficulties; for the saying, that \"without Him was not anything made,\" and then the adding, \"which was made,\" includes things cognizable by the intellect,[fn-4-P403_111431:12-nf] but excludes the Spirit.

That no one should except any created things from the works of God because of their being invisible, nor yet should confound the Comforter with them, after running through the objects of sense which are known to all, he enumerates also things in the heavens, saying, \"Whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers\"; for the expression \"whether\" subjoined to each, shows to us nothing else but this, that \"by Him all things were made, and without Him was not anything made that was made.\"","index":"10","references":[]},{"text":"But if you think that the expression \"by\"[fn-4-P406_113034:13-nf] is a mark of inferiority, (as making Christ an instrument,) hear him say, \"Thou, Lord, in the beginning, hast laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Thy hands.\" (Ps. cii. 25.) He says of the Son what is said of the Father in His character of Creator; which he would not have said, unless he had deemed of Him as of a Creator, and yet not subservient to any. And if the expression \"by Him\" is here used, it is put for no other reason but to prevent any one from supposing the Son to be Unbegotten. For that in respect of the title of Creator He is nothing inferior to the Father; hear from Himself, where He saith, \"As the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them, even so the Son quickeneth whom He will.\" (c. v. 21.) If now in the Old Testament it is said of the Son, \"Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth,\" His title of Creator is plain. But if you say that the Prophet spoke this of the Father, and that Paul attributed to the Son what was said of the Father, even so the conclusion is the same. For Paul would not have decided that the same expression suited the Son, unless he had been very confident that between Father and Son there was an equality of honor; since it would have been an act of extremest rashness to refer what suited an incomparable Nature to a nature inferior to, and falling short of it. But the Son is not inferior to, nor falls short of, the Essence of the Father; and therefore Paul has not only dared to use these expressions concerning Him, but also others like them. For the expression \"from Whom,\" which you decide to belong properly to the Father alone, he uses also concerning the Son, when he says, \"from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.\" (Col. ii. 19.)","index":"11","references":[{"fn":"4","code":"P406_113034","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"Or, through dia;.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"[3.] And he is not content with this only, he stops your mouths in another way also, by applying to the Father the expression \"by whom,\" which you say is a mark of inferiority.

Neither is the expression \"from[fn-4-P408_115354:14-nf] whom,\" assigned to the Son only, but also to the Spirit; for the angel said to Joseph, \"Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.\" (Matt. i. 20.)

John having spoken of the work of creation, that \"All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made,\" goes on to speak concerning His Providence, where he saith, \"In Him was Life.\" That no one may doubt how so many and so great things were \"made by Him,\" he adds, that \"In Him was Life.\" For as with the fountain which is the mother of the great deeps, however much you take away you nothing lessen the fountain; so with the energy of the Only-Begotten, however much you believe has been produced and made by it, it has become no whit the less. Or, to use a more familiar example, I will instance that of light, which the Apostle himself added immediately, saying, \"And the Life was the Light.\" As then light, however many myriads it may enlighten, suffers no diminution of its own brightness; so also God, before commencing His work and after completing it, remains alike indefectible, nothing diminished, nor wearied by the greatness of the creation. Nay, if need were that ten thousand, or even an infinite number of such worlds be created, He remains the same, sufficient for them all not merely to produce, but also to control them after their creation. For the word \"Life\" here refers not merely to the act of creation, but also to the providence (engaged) about the permanence of the things created; it also lays down beforehand the doctrine of the resurrection, and is the beginning[fn-4-P413_118074:18-nf] of these marvelous good tidings.[fn-4-P414_118122:19-nf] Since when \"life\" has come to be with us, the power of death is dissolved; and when \"light\" has shone upon us, there is no longer darkness, but life ever abides within us, and death cannot overcome it. So that what is asserted of the Father might be asserted absolutely of Him (Christ) also, that \"In Him we live and move and have our being.\" (Col. i. 16, Col i. 17.)

Thus in another place he says, that \"God is Light\" (1 John i. 5), and elsewhere (it is said), that He \"dwelleth in light unapproachable\" (1 Tim. vi. 16); yet these expressions are used not that we may suppose a compounded nature,[fn-4-P418_119344:22-nf] but that by little and little we may be led up to the highest doctrines.

For, as in darkness a man knows neither friend nor foe, but cannot perceive any of the properties of objects; so too is it in sin. For he who desires to get more gain, makes no difference between friend and enemy; and the envious regards with hostile eyes the man with whom he is very intimate; and the plotter is at mortal quarrel with all alike.

Nor is this the only evil which happens to us who are in sin, but this also, that we live in constant fear: and as men walking in a moonless night tremble, though none be by to frighten them; so those who work iniquity cannot have confidence, though there be none to accuse them; but they are afraid of everything, and are suspicious, being pricked by their conscience: all to them is full of fear and distress,[fn-4-P429_124372:28-nf] they look about them at everything, are terrified at everything.

To go naked no one has ever willingly endured; but all men are continually venturing on the others without any fear.

Amen.","index":"20","references":[{"fn":"4","code":"P431_125307","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"eu0sxhmo/nwj, \"decently.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"4","code":"P432_125730","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"pleoneci/aj.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"4","code":"P433_125847","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"i0tameuo/menoi.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"4","code":"P434_127318","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"e0pispasw/meqa.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"4","code":"P435_127359","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"a0kti=na.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"","index":"21","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"22","references":[]}]}]}
