For when He gave them bread, and filled their bellies, they said that He was a Prophet, and sought to make Him a King: but when He taught them concerning spiritual food, concerning eternal life, when He led them away from objects of sense, and spake to them of a resurrection, and raised their thoughts to higher matters, when most they ought to have admired, they murmur and start away. And yet, if He was that Prophet as they before asserted, declaring that he it was of whom Moses had said, \"A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me, unto Him shall ye hearken\" (Deut. xviii. 15); they ought to have hearkened to Him when He said, \"I came down from heaven\"; yet they hearkened not, but murmured. They still reverenced Him, because the miracle of the loaves was recent, and therefore they did not openly gainsay Him, but by murmuring expressed their displeasure, that He did not give them the meal which they desired. And murmuring they said, \"Is not this the son of Joseph?\" Whence it is plain, that as yet they knew not of His strange and marvelous Generation. And so they still say that He is the son of Joseph, and are not rebuked; and He saith not to them, \"I am not the Son of Joseph\"; not because He was his son, but because they were not as yet able to hear of that marvelous Birth. And if they could not bear to hear in plain terms of His birth according to the flesh, much less could they hear of that ineffable Birth which is from above. If He revealed not that which was lower to them, much less would He commit to them the other. Although this greatly offended them, that He was born from a mean and common father, still He revealed not to them the truth, lest in removing one cause of offense He should create another.

(Mark iv. 34: see Matt. xiii. 36.) What then shall we say? What is the profit of the words? Great is the profit and necessity of them. Because they pressed upon Him, asking for bodily food, reminding Him of the food provided in the days of their forefathers, and speaking of the manna as a great thing, to show them that all those things were but type and shadow, but that the very reality of the matter was now present with them, He mentioneth spiritual food. \"But,\" saith some one, \"he ought to have said, Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, but I have given you bread.\" But the interval between the two miracles was great, and the latter of them would have appeared inferior to the former, because the manna came down from heaven, but this, the miracle of the loaves, was wrought on earth. When therefore they sought food \"coming down from heaven,\" He continually told them, \"I came down from heaven.\" And if any one enquire why He introduced the discourse on the Mysteries, we will reply, that this was a very fitting time for such discourses; for indistinctness in what is said always rouses the bearer, and renders him more attentive. They ought not then to have been offended, but rather to have asked and enquired. But now they went back. If they believed Him to be a Prophet, they ought to have believed His words, so that the offense was caused by their own folly, not by any difficulty in the words. And observe how by little and little He led them up to Himself.

For if as yet they had no clear knowledge of the Resurrection, and so knew not what, \"Destroy this Temple, and in three days I will raise it up\" (John ii. 19), might mean, much more would they be ignorant of what is said here. For these words were less clear than those. Since that prophets had raised men[fn-25-P2515_850802:14-nf] from the dead, they knew, even if the Scriptures have not spoken so clearly on the subject, but not one of them ever asserted that any man had eaten flesh. Still they obeyed, and followed Him, and confessed that He had the words of eternal life. For this is a disciple's part, not to be over-curious about the assertions of his teacher, but to hear and obey him, and to wait the proper time for the solution of any difficulties. \"How then,\" saith some one, \"was it that the contrary came to pass, and that these men `went back'?\" It was by reason of their folly.

Wherefore it is necessary to understand the marvel of the Mysteries, what it is, why it was given, and what is the profit of the action. We become one Body, and \"members of His flesh and of His bones.\" (Eph. v. 30.) Let the initiated[fn-25-P2519_852500:15-nf] follow what I say. In order then that we may become this not by love only, but in very deed, let us be blended[fn-25-P2520_852635:16-nf] into that flesh. This is effected by the food which He hath freely given us, desiring to show the love which He hath for us. On this account He hath mixed up Himself with us; He hath kneaded up[fn-25-P2521_852851:17-nf] His body with ours, that we might be a certain One Thing,[fn-25-P2522_852925:18-nf] like a body joined to a head. For this belongs to[fn-25-P2523_852987:19-nf] them who love strongly; this, for instance, Job implied, speaking of his servants, by whom he was beloved so exceedingly, that they desired to cleave unto his flesh. For they said, to show the strong love which they felt, \"Who would give us to be satisfied with his flesh?\" (Job xxxi. 31.), Wherefore this also Christ hath done, to lead us to a closer friendship, and to show His love for us; He hath given to those who desire Him not only to see Him, but even to touch, and eat Him, and fix their teeth in His flesh, and to embrace Him, and satisfy all their love. Let us then return from that table like lions breathing fire, having become terrible to the devil; thinking on our Head, and on the love which He hath shown for us. Parents often entrust their offspring to others to feed; \"but I,\" saith He, \"do not so, I feed you with Mine own flesh, desiring that you all be nobly born,[fn-25-P2524_853899:20-nf] and holding forth to you good hopes for the future. For He who giveth out Himself to you here, much more will do so hereafter.

This[fn-25-P2526_854616:22-nf] blood, if rightly taken, driveth away devils, and keepeth them afar off from us, while it calleth to us Angels and the Lord of Angels. For wherever they see the Lord's blood, devils flee, and Angels run together. This blood poured forth washed clean all the world; many wise sayings did the blessed Paul utter concerning it in the Epistle to the Hebrews. This blood cleansed the secret place, and the Holy of Holies. And if the type of it had such great power in the temple of the Hebrews, and in the midst of Egypt, when smeared on the door-posts, much more the reality. This blood sanctified the golden altar; without it the high priest dared not enter into the secret place. This blood consecrated[fn-25-P2527_855349:23-nf] priests, this in types cleansed[fn-25-P2528_855401:24-nf] sins.
