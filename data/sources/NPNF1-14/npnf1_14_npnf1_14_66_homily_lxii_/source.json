This at least they who sent said, \"Behold, he whom Thou lovest is sick.\" But let us consider the passage from the beginning. \"A certain man,\" It saith, \"was sick, Lazarus of Bethany.\" Not without a cause nor by chance hath the writer mentioned whence Lazarus was, but for a reason which he will afterwards tell us. At present let us keep to the passage before us. He also for our advantage informeth us who were Lazarus' sisters; and, moreover, what Mary had more (than the other), going on to say, \"It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment.\" Here some doubting[fn-33-P3399_1158036:2-nf] say, \"How did the Lord endure that a woman should do this?\" In the first place then it is necessary to understand, that this is not the harlot mentioned in Matthew (Matt. xxvi. 7), or the one in Luke (Luke vii. 37), but a different person; they were harlots full of many vices, but she was both grave and earnest; for she showed her earnestness about the entertainment of Christ. The Evangelist also means to show, that the sisters too loved Him, yet He allowed Lazarus to die. Butwhy did they not, like the centurion and the nobleman, leave their sick brother, and cometo Christ, instead of sending? They were veryconfident in Christ, and had towards Him astrong familiar feeling. Besides, they were weak women, and oppressed with grief; for that they acted not in this way as thinking slightly of Him, they afterwards showed. It is then clear, that this Mary was not the harlot. \"But wherefore,\" saith some one, \"did Christ admit that harlot?\" That He might put away her iniquity; that He might show His lovingkindness; that thou mightest learn that there is no malady which prevaileth over His goodness. Look not therefore at this only, that He received her, but consider the other point also, how He changed her. But, (to return,) why doth the Evangelist relate this history to us?

And this they do, some from grief, others from ostentation and rivalry, others from wantonness; and they bare their arms, and this too in the sight of men. Why doest thou, woman? Dost thou strip thyself in unseemly sort, tell me, thou who art a member of Christ, in the midst of the market-place, when men are present there? Dost thou pluck thy hair, and rend thy garments, and wail loudly,[fn-34-P3485_1174523:38-nf] and join the dance, and keep throughout a resemblance to Bacchanalian women, and dost thou not think that thou art offending God? What madness is this? Will not the heathen[fn-34-P3486_1174742:39-nf] laugh? Will they not deem our doctrines fables? They will say, \"There is no resurrection-the doctrines of the Christians are mockeries, trickery, and contrivance. For their women lament as though there were nothing after this world; they give no heed to the words engraven in their books; all those wordsare fictions, and these women show that they are so. Since had they believed that he who hath died is not dead, but hath removed to a better life, they would not have mourned him as no longer being, they would not have thus beaten themselves,[fn-34-P3487_1175309:40-nf] they would not have uttered such words as these, full of unbelief, `I shall never see thee more, I shall never more regain thee,' all their religion is a fable, and if the very chief of good things is thus wholly disbelieved by them, much more the other things which are reverenced among them.\" The heathen[fn-34-P3488_1175652:41-nf] are not so womanish, among them many have practiced heavenly wisdom; and a woman hearing that her child had fallen in battle, straightway asked, \"And in what state are the affairs of the city?\" Another truly wise, when being garlanded[fn-34-P3489_1175907:42-nf] he heard that his son had fallen for his country, took off the garland, and asked which of the two; then when he had learnt which it was, immediately put the garland on again. Many also gave their sons and their daughters for slaughter in honor of their evil deities; and Lacedaemonian women exhort their sons either to bring back their shield safe from war, or to be brought back dead upon it. Wherefore I am ashamed thatthe heathen show true wisdom in these matters, and we act unseemly. Those who know nothing about the Resurrection act the part of those who know; and those who know, the part of those who know not. And ofttimes many dothrough shame of men what they do not for the sake of God. For women of the higher class neither tear[fn-34-P3490_1176679:43-nf] their hair nor bare their arms; which very thing is a most heavy charge against them, not because they do not strip themselves, but because they act as they do not through piety, but that they may not be thought to disgrace themselves. Is their shame stronger than grief, and the fear of God not stronger? And must not this deserve severest censure? What the rich women do because of their riches, the poor ought to do through fear of God; but at present it is quite the contrary; the rich act wisely through vainglory, the poor through littleness of soul act unseemly. What is worse than this anomaly? We do all for men, all for the things of earth. And these people utter words full of madness and much ridicule. The Lord saith indeed, \"Blessed are they that mourn\" (Matt. v. 4), speaking of those who mourn[fn-34-P3491_1177510:44-nf] for their sins; and no one mourneth that kind of mourning, nor careth for a lost soul; but this other we were not bidden to practice, and we practice it.[fn-34-P3492_1177683:45-nf] \"What then?\" saith some one, \"Is it possible being man not to weep?\" No, neither do I[fn-34-P3493_1177807:46-nf] forbid weeping, but I forbid the beating yourselves, the weeping immoderately.[fn-34-P3494_1177908:47-nf] I am neither brutal nor cruel. I know that our nature asks[fn-34-P3495_1178032:48-nf] and seeks for its friends and daily companions; it cannot but be grieved. As also Christ showed, for He wept over Lazarus. So do thou; weep, but gently, but with decency, but with the fear of God. If so thou weepest, thou dost so not as disbelieving the Resurrection, but as not enduring the separation. Since even over those who are leaving us, and departing to foreign lands, we weep, yet we do this not as despairing.","index":"53","references":[{"fn":"34","code":"P3484_1174040","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"making bloody.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"34","code":"P3485_1174523","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"and raise loud wailings, and leap.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"34","code":"P3486_1174742","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"lit. \"Greeks.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"34","code":"P3487_1175309","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"have been thus inflamed.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"34","code":"P3488_1175652","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"lit. \"Greeks.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"34","code":"P3489_1175907","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"i.e. about to sacrifice.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"34","code":"P3490_1176679","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"loose n.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"34","code":"P3491_1177510","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"bewail.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"34","code":"P3492_1177683","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"to mourn, and we mourn it.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"34","code":"P3493_1177807","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"why, do I.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"34","code":"P3494_1177908","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"al. \"I forbid not to grieve, but I forbid to act unseemly.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"34","code":"P3495_1178032","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"or, \"is overcome.\"","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"[5.] And so do thou weep, as if thou wert sending one on his way to another land. These things I say, not as giving a rule of action, but as condescending (to human infirmity). For if the dead man have been a sinner, and one who hath in many things offended God, it behooveth to weep (or rather not to weep only, since that is of no avail to him, but to do what one can to procure[fn-34-P3497_1178857:49-nf] some comfort for him by almsgivings and offerings;[fn-34-P3498_1178925:50-nf] ) but it behooveth also to rejoice at this, that his wickedness hath been cut short. If he have been righteous, it again[fn-34-P3499_1179082:51-nf] behooveth to be glad, that what is his is now placed in security, free from the uncertainty of the future; if young, that he hath been quickly delivered from the common evils of life; if old, that he hath departed after taking to satiety that which is held desirable. But thou, neglecting to consider these things, incitest thy hand-maidens to act as mourners, as if forsooth thou wert honoring the dead, when it is an act of extreme dishonor.[fn-35-P3500_1179543:52-nf] For honor to the dead is not wailings and lamentings, but hymns and psalmodies and an excellent life. The good man when hedeparteth, shall depart with angels, though no man be near his remains; but the corrupt, though he have a city to attend his funeral, shall be nothing profited. Wilt thou honor him who is gone? Honor him in another way, by alms-deeds, by acts of beneficence and public service.[fn-35-P3501_1179976:53-nf] What avail the many lamentations? And I have heard also another grievous thing, that many women attract lovers by their sad cries, acquiring by the fervor of their wailings a reputation for affection to their husbands. O devilish purpose! O Satanic invention![fn-35-P3502_1180255:54-nf] How long are we but dust and ashes, how long but blood and flesh? Look we up to heaven, take we thought of spiritual things.[fn-35-P3503_1180400:55-nf] How shall we be able to rebuke the heathen,[fn-35-P3504_1180479:56-nf] howto exhort them, when we do such things? How shall we dispute with them concerning the Resurrection? How about the rest of heavenly wisdom? How shall we ourselves live without fear? Knowest not thou that of grief[fn-35-P3505_1180714:57-nf] cometh death? for grief darkening[fn-35-P3506_1180773:58-nf] the seeing part of the soul not only hindereth it from perceiving anything that it ought, but also worketh it great mischief. In one way then we offend God, and advantage neither ourselves nor him who is gone; in the other we please God, and gain honor among men. If we sink not down ourselves, He will soon remove the remains of our despondency; if we are discontented, He permitteth us to be given up to grief. If we are thankful, we shall not despond. \"But how,\" saith some one, \"is it possible not to be grieved, when one has lost a son or daughter or wife?\" I say not, \"not to grieve,\" but \"not to do so immoderately.\" For if we consider that God hath taken away, and that the husband or son which we had was mortal, we shall soon receive comfort. To be discontented is the act of those who seek for something higher than their nature. Thou wast born man, and mortal; why then grievest thou that what is natural hath come to pass? Grievest thou that thou art nourished by eating? Seekest thou to live without this?[fn-35-P3507_1181816:59-nf] Act thus also in the case of death, and being mortal seek not as vet for immortality. Once for all this thing hath been appointed. Grieve not therefore, nor play the mourner, but submit to laws laid on all alike. Grieve for thy sins; this is good mourning, this is highest wisdom. Let us then mourn for this cause continually, that we may obtain the joy which is there, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
