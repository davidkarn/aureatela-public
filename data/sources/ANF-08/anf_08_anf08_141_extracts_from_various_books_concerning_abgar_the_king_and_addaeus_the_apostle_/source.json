For, had He not willed, He had not died, because He is Lord of death, the exit from this life; nor, had it not pleased Him, would He have put on a body, inasmuch as He is Himself the framer of the body. For that will which led Him to stoop to be born of the Virgin, likewise caused Him further to descend to the suffering of death.-And a little after (we read): For, although His appearance was that of men, yet His power, and His knowledge, and his authority, were those of God.","index":"13","references":[]},{"text":"\nII.","index":"14","references":[]},{"text":"From the teaching of Addaeus the apostle, which was spoken in the city of Edessa.[fn-96-P9656_3080659:2-nf] ","index":"15","references":[{"fn":"96","code":"P9656_3080659","folder":"ANF-08","text":"From Cod.

For it is not without perceptions, after the manner of the bodily frame, which has no perception of that corruption which has acquired dominion over it. Recompense, however, and reward it will not receive apart from its bodily form, because what it experiences belongs not to itself alone, but to the bodily form also in which it dwelt for a time.
