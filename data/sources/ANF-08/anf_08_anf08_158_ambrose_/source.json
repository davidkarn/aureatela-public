Hephaestus was not, indeed, at first aware of the love existing between Venus[fn-117-P11764_3490295:20-nf] his wife and Ares; but, when he did become acquainted with it, Hephaestus said: \"Come, see a ridiculous and senseless piece of behaviour-how to me, who am her own, Venus, the daughter of the sovereign of the gods, is offering insult-to me, I say, who am her own, and is paying honour to Ares, who is a stranger to her.\" But to the sovereign of the gods it was not displeasing: for he loved such as were like these.
