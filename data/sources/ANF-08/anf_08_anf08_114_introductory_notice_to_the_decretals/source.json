Like the mason's framework of lath and scantlings, on which he turns an arch of massive stone, the Decretals served their purpose, enabling Nicholas I. to found the Papacy by their insignificant aid. That swelling arch of vanity once reared, the framework might be knocked out; but the fabric stood, and has borne up every weight imposed upon it for ages. Its strong abutments have been ignorance and despotism. Nicholas produced his flimsy framework of imposture, and amazed the whole Church by the audacity of the claims he founded upon it. The age, however, was unlearned and uncritical; and, in spite of remonstrances from France under lead of Hincmar, bishop of Rheims, the West patiently submitted to the overthrow of the ancient Canons and the Nicene Constitutions, and bowed to the yoke of a new canon-law, of which these frauds were not only made an integral, but the essential, part. The East never accepted them for a moment: her great patriarchates retain the Nicene System to this day. But, as the established religion of the \"Holy Roman Empire,\" the national churches of Western Europe, one by one, succumbed to this revolt from historic Catholicity. The Eastern churches were the more numerous. They stood by the Constitutions confirmed by all the Oecumenical Synods; they altered not a word of the Nicene Creed; they stood up for the great Catholic law, \"Let the ancient customs prevail; \"and they were, and are to this day, the grand historic stem of Christendom. The Papacy created the Western schism, and contrived to call it \"the schism of the Greeks.\" The Decretals had created the Papacy, and they enabled the first Pope to assume that communion with himself was the test of Catholic communion: hence his excommunication of the Easterns, which, after brief intervals of relaxation, settled into the chronic schism of the Papacy, and produced the awful history of the mediaeval Church in Western Europe.","index":"2","references":[]},{"text":"In naming Nicholas I. as the founder of the Papacy, and the first Pope, I merely reach the logical consequence of admitted facts and demonstrated truths. I merely apply the recognised principles of modern thought and scientific law to the science of history, and dismiss the technology of empiricism in this science, as our age has abolished similar empiricisms in the exact sciences. For ages after Copernicus, even those who basked in the light of the true system of the universe went on in the old ruts, talking as if the Ptolemaic theory were yet a reality: and so the very historians whose lucid pages explode the whole fabric of the Papal communion, still go on, in the language of fable, giving to the early Bishops of Rome the title of \"Popes; \"counting St. Peter as the first Pope; bewildering the student by many confusions of fact with fable; and conceding to the modern fabric of Romanism the name of \"the Catholic Church,\" with all the immense advantages that accrue to falsehood by such a surrender of truth, and the consequent endowment of imposture with the raiment and the domain of Apostolic antiquity.

Thus the Papacy was formed on the base of the \"Holy Roman Empire,\" and arrogated to itself the right to cut off and anathematize the greater part of Christendom, with the old patriarchal Sees.

Twice he argues from the pseudo-decretal of St. Anacletus, at another time from a synodical letter of St. Athanasius to Felix, at another time from a letter of Julius to the Easterns, all forgeries.

They are now rejected by common consent, and even by those authors who are most favourable to the court of Rome, who are obliged to abandon the patronage of these epistles, though they have done a great deal of service in developing the greatness of the court of Rome, and ruining the ancient discipline of the Church, especially with reference to the rights of bishops and ecclesiastical decisions.","index":"87","references":[]},{"text":"The following is the Translator's Preface to these frauds:-","index":"88","references":[]},{"text":"In regard to these Decretals, Dean Milman says: \"Up to this period the Decretals, the letters or edicts of the Bishops of Rome, according to the authorized or common collection of Dionsysius, commenced with Pope Siricius, towards the close of the fourth century. To the collection of Dionysius was added that of the authentic councils, which bore the name of Isidore of Seville. On a sudden was promulgated, unannounced, without preparation, not absolutely unquestioned, but apparently overawing at once all doubt, a new code, which to the former authentic documents added fifty-nine letters and decrees of the twenty oldest popes from Clement to Melchiades,[fn-88-P8867_2888086:11-nf] and the donation of Constantine;[fn-88-P8868_2888141:12-nf] and in the third part, among the decrees of the popes and of the councils from Sylvester to Gregory II., thirty-nine false decrees, and the acts of several unauthentic councils.\"[fn-88-P8869_2888343:13-nf] ","index":"89","references":[{"fn":"88","code":"P8867_2888086","folder":"ANF-08","text":"Elucidation I.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"88","code":"P8868_2888141","folder":"ANF-08","text":"Elucidation II.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"88","code":"P8869_2888343","folder":"ANF-08","text":"History of Latin Christianity, vol. iii. p. 191.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"In regard to the authorship and date of the False Decretals, Dean Milman says: \"The author or authors of this most audacious and elaborate of pious frauds are unknown; the date and place of its compilation are driven into such narrow limits that they may be determined within a few years, and within a very circumscribed region. The False Decretals came not from Rome; the time of their arrival at Rome, after they were known beyond the Alps, appears almost certain. In one year Nicholas I. is apparently ignorant of their existence; the next he speaks of them with full knowledge. They contain words manifestly used at the Council of Paris, a.d.829, consequently are of later date. They were known to the Levite Benedict of Mentz, who composed a supplement to the collection of capitularies-by Ansegise, between a.d.840-847.
