The first edition was published by Cotelerius in his collection of the Apostolic Fathers, from a manuscript in the Royal Library at Paris, the only manuscript of the work then known to exist. He derived assistance from an epitome of the work which he found in the same library. The text of Cotelerius was revised by Clericus in his edition of Cotelerius, but more carefully by Schwegler, Stuttgart, 1847. The Paris ms.breaks off in the middle of the fourteenth chapter of the nineteenth book.","index":"4","references":[{"fn":"32","code":"P3249_1013561","folder":"ANF-08","text":"See his genuine Epistle, vol. i. p. 1, this series.

In 1859 (Leipzig) he published an edition of two Epitomes of the Homilies,-the one previously edited by Turnebus and Cotelerius being given more fully, and the other appearing for the first time. To these Epitomes were appended notes by Frederic Wieseler on the Homilies. The last edition of the Clementines is by Paul de Lagarde (Leipzig, 1865), which has no new sources, is pretentious, but far from accurate.
