A man, for instance, who is a murderer, is, in so far as he is a man, a substance; but the murder which he commits is not a substance, but a work of the substance. Moreover, we speak of a man sometimes as had because he commits murder; and sometimes, again, because he performs acts of beneficence, as good: and these names adhere to the substance, in consequence of the things which are accidents of it, which, however, are not the substance itself.

If, then, you go so far as to say that God is weak by nature, it seems to me that you imperil your salvation itself; but, if you say that He is weak through being overcome by fear of a greater, things evil will be greater than God, since they frustrate the carrying out of His purpose. But this, as it seems to me, it would be absurd to say of God. For why should not `they' rather be considered gods, since according to your account they are able to overcome God: if, that is to say, we mean by God that which has a controlling power over all things?","index":"61","references":[]},{"text":"\"But I wish to ask you a few questions concerning matter itself. Pray tell me, therefore, whether matter was something simple or compound. I am induced to adopt this method of investigating the subject before us by considering the diversity that obtains in existing things. For, if perchance matter was something simple and uniform, how comes it that the world is compound,[fn-123-P12368_3619428:22-nf] and consists of, divers substances and combinations? For by `compound' we denote a mixture of certain simple elements. But if, on the contrary, you prefer to call matter compound, you will, of course, be asserting that it is compounded of certain simple elements. And, if it was compounded of simple elements, these simple elements must have existed at some time or other separately by themselves, and when they were compounded together matter came into being: from which it of course follows that matter is created. For, if matter is compound, and compound things are constituted from simple, there was once a time when matter had no existence,-namely, before the simple elements came together. And, if there was once a time when matter was not, and there was never a time when the uncreated was not, matter cannot be uncreated. And hence there will be many uncreated substances. For, if God was uncreated, and the simple elements out of which matter was compounded were also uncreated, there will not be two uncreated things only,-not to discuss the question what it is which constitutes objects simple, whether matter or form.","index":"62","references":[{"fn":"123","code":"P12368_3619428","folder":"ANF-08","text":"The text has, su/nqetoj de\\ o0 ko/smoj; which Migne changes to, pw=j dh\\ su/nqeto/j e0stin o9 ko/smoj;","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"\"Is it, further, your opinion that nothing in existence is opposed to itself? \"","index":"63","references":[]},{"text":"\"It is.\"","index":"64","references":[]},{"text":"\"Is water, then, opposed to fire? \"","index":"65","references":[]},{"text":"\"So it appears to me.\"","index":"66","references":[]},{"text":"\"Similarly, is darkness opposed to light, and warm to cold, and moreover moist to dry? \"","index":"67","references":[]},{"text":"\"It seems to me to be so.\"","index":"68","references":[]},{"text":"\"Well, then, if nothing in existence is opposed to itself, and these things are opposed to each other, they cannot be one and the same matter; no, nor yet be made out of one and the same matter.","index":"69","references":[]},{"text":"\"I wish further to ask your opinion on a matter kindred to that of which we have been speaking.

White, for example, is not opposed to itself, but is said to be the opposite of black; and, similarly, light is shown not to be opposed to itself, but is considered an opposite in relation to darkness; and so of a very great number of things besides. If, then, matter were some one thing, it could not be opposed to itself.
