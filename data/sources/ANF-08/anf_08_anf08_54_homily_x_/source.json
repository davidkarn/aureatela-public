But those who have chosen to worship one God, and who have learned of the eternal life given to the good, if they either believe or do anything different from what is pleasing to God, are like to those who have gone out from the city of punishment, and are desirous to come to the well-stored city, and on the road have strayed from the right path.\"","index":"32","references":[]}]},{"name":"Chapter III.-Man the Lord of All.","index":4,"paragraphs":[{"text":"While he was thus discoursing to us, there entered one of our people, who had been appointed to make the following announcement to him, and said: \"My lord Peter, there are great multitudes standing before the doors.\" With his consent, therefore, a great multitude entered.
