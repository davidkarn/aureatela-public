Little as we have of his remains, Lardner shows how very useful is that little. (1) He testifies to the Apostles as delivering the words of Christ Himself; (2) to the jealousy of the early Christians in siring inspired writings from those of no authority as Scriptures; (3) to their methods, as in the case of the pseudo-gospel of Peter; and (4) to the utterly apocryphal character of that book, which Grabe and others suppose to be the work of Leucius, a noted forger and falsifier. It had never been heard of in the great See of Antioch, and this famous bishop could only get sight of it by fishing it out of the dirty pool of the Docetae.","index":"5","references":[]},{"text":"\nI.","index":"6","references":[]},{"text":"From the epistle to Caricus and Ponticus.[fn-124-P12463_3634728:1-nf] ","index":"7","references":[{"fn":"124","code":"P12463_3634728","folder":"ANF-08","text":"In Eusebius, Hist.

But, now that I have learnt from what has been told me that their mind was secretly cherishing some heresy,[fn-124-P12474_3635930:7-nf] I will make all haste to come to you again. Expect me therefore, brethren, shortly.
