Wherefore as man, having something more than the irrational animals, namely, rationality, purify your hearts from evil by heavenly reasoning, and wash your bodies in the bath. For purification according to the truth is not that the purity of the body precedes purification after the heart, but that purity follows goodness. For our Teacher also, dealing with certain of the Pharisees and Scribes among us, who are separated, and as Scribes know the matters of the law more than others, still He reproved them as hypocrites, because they cleansed only the things that appear to men, but omitted purity of heart and the things seen by God alone.","index":"94","references":[]}]},{"name":"Chapter XXIX.-Outward and Inward Purity.","index":30,"paragraphs":[{"text":"\"Therefore He made use of this memorable expression, speaking the truth with respect to the hypocrites of them, not with respect to all. For to some He said that obedience was to be rendered, because they were entrusted with the chair of Moses. However, to the hypocrites he said, `Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye make clean the outside of the cup and the platter, hut the inside is full of filth. Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and the platter, that their outsides may be clean also.' And truly: for when the mind is enlightened by knowledge, the disciple is able to be good, and thereupon purity follows; for from the understanding within a good care of the body without is produced. As from negligence with respect to the body, care of the understanding cannot be produced, so the pure man can purify both that which is without and that which is within. And he who, purifying the things without, does it looking to the praise of men, and by the praise of those who look on, he has nothing from God.","index":"96","references":[]}]},{"name":"Chapter XXX.-\"Whatsoever Things are Pure.\"","index":31,"paragraphs":[{"text":"\"But who is there to whom it is not manifest that it is better not to have intercourse with a woman in her separation, but purified and washed.

Receive, therefore, from all quarters the things that are your own, and not those that are another's, and do not say, If those who are in error do anything well we are not bound to do it.

Unquestionably we ought-we who hope to inherit eternal life-to do better things than the good things that are done by those who know only the present life, knowing that if their works, being judged with ours in the day of judgment, be found equal in goodness, we shall have shame, and they perdition, having acted against themselves through error. And I say that we shall be put to shame on this account, because we have not done more than they, though we have known more than they.

And this speech has been suggested to me, taking occasion from the necessity of respecting the separation, and of washing after copulation, and of not denying such purity, though those who are in error do the same, since those who in error do well, without being saved, are for the condemnation of those who are in the worship of God, and do ill; because their respect for purity is through error, and not through the worship of the true Father and God of all.\"","index":"104","references":[{"fn":"46","code":"P4696_1388262","folder":"ANF-08","text":"Luke xi. 31.-R.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":11,"verses":[31]}]},{"fn":"46","code":"P4697_1388592","folder":"ANF-08","text":"Matt. xii. 41","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":12,"verses":[41]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter XXXIV.-Peter's Daily Work.","index":35,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Having said this, he dismissed the multitudes; and according to his custom, having partaken of food with those dearest to him, he Went to rest.
