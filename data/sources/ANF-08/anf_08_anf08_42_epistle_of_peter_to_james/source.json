Wherefore also the fruit of that caution appears even till now. For his countrymen keep the same rule of monarchy and polity everywhere, being unable in any way to think otherwise, or to be led out of the way of the much-indicating Scriptures. For, according to the rule delivered to them, they endeavour to correct the discordances of the Scriptures, if any one, haply not knowing the traditions, is confounded at the various utterances of the prophets. Wherefore they charge no one to teach, unless he has first learned how the Scriptures must be used. And thus they have amongst them one God, one law, one hope.","index":"10","references":[]}]},{"name":"Chapter II.-Misrepresentation of Peter's Doctrine.","index":4,"paragraphs":[{"text":"In order, therefore, that the like may also happen to those among us as to these Seventy, give the books of my preachings to our brethren, with the like mystery of initiation, that they may indoctrinate those who wish to take part in teaching; for if it be not so done, our word of truth will be rent into many opinions. And this I know, not as being a prophet, but as already seeing the beginning of this very evil. For some from among the Gentiles have rejected my legal preaching, attaching themselves to certain lawless and trifling preaching of the man who is my enemy.[fn-32-P3264_1016833:2-nf] And these things some have attempted while I am still alive, to transform my words by certain various interpretations, in order to the dissolution of the law; as though I also myself were of such a mind, but did not freely proclaim it, which God forbid! For such a thing were to act in opposition to the law of God which was spoken by Moses, and was borne witness to by our Lord in respect of its eternal continuance; for thus he spoke: \"The heavens and the earth shall pass away, but one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law.\"[fn-32-P3265_1017466:3-nf] And this He has said, that all things might come to pass. But these men, professing, I know not how, to know my mind, undertake to explain my words, which they have heard of me, more intelligently than I who spoke them, telling their catechumens that this is my meaning, which indeed I never thought of. But if, while I am still alive, they dare thus to misrepresent me, how much more will those who shall come after me dare to do so!","index":"12","references":[{"fn":"32","code":"P3264_1016833","folder":"ANF-08","text":"This is one of the strongest anti-Pauline insinuations in the entire literature.-R.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"32","code":"P3265_1017466","folder":"ANF-08","text":"This is a fair specimen of the loose method of Scripture citation characteristic of the Clementine literature.

Therefore James, having read the epistle, sent for the elders; and having read it to them, said: \"Our Peter has strictly and becomingly charged us concerning the establishing of the truth, that we should not communicate the books of his preachings, which have been sent to us, to any one at random, but to one who is good and religious, and who wishes to teach, and who is circumcised, and faithful. And these are not all to be committed to him at once; that, if he be found injudicious in the first, the others may not be entrusted to him. Wherefore let him be proved not less than six years. And then according to the initiation of Moses, he that is to deliver the books should bring him to a river or a fountain, which is living water, where the regeneration of the righteous takes place, and should make him, not swear-for that is not lawful-but to stand by the water and adjure, as we ourselves, when we were re-generated,[fn-32-P3272_1020003:4-nf] were made to do for the sake of not stoning.","index":"16","references":[{"fn":"32","code":"P3272_1020003","folder":"ANF-08","text":"The form of adjuration has some points of resemblance with the baptismal forms given by Hippolytus, as those of the Elkesaites.

But if even it should ever seem to me that the books of the preachings given to me are not true, I shall not so communicate them, but shall give them back. And when I go abroad, I shall carry them with me, whatever of them I happen to possess. But if I be not minded to carry them about with me, I shall not suffer them to be in my house, but shall deposit them with my bishop, having the same faith, and setting out from the same persons as myself.[fn-32-P3275_1021995:5-nf] But if it befall me to be sick, and in expectation of death, and if I be childless, I shall act in the same manner.

Therefore James, perceiving that they were greatly afraid, said: \"Hear me, brethren and fellow-servants. If we should give the books to all indiscriminately, and they should be corrupted by any daring men, or be perverted by interpretations, as you have heard that some have already done, it will remain even for those who really seek the truth, always to wander in error. Wherefore it is better that they should be with us, and that we should communicate them with all the fore-mentioned care to those who wish to live piously, and to save others. But if any one, after taking this adjuration, shall act otherwise, he shall with good reason incur eternal punishment. For why should not he who is the cause of the destruction of others not be destroyed himself? \"The elders, therefore, being pleased with the sentiments of James exclaimed, \"Blessed be He who, as foreseeing all things, has graciously appointed thee as our bishop; \"and when they had said this, we all rose up, and prayed to the Father and God of all, to whom be glory for ever.
