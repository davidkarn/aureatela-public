The later Hebrew names also are here added for comparison. It must, however, be noticed that \"the years employed in the Syrian Calendar, were, at least after the incarnation, Julian years, composed of Roman months.\" (See L'Art de verifier les dates:  Paris, 1818, tom. i. p. 45.) The correspondence with the Hebrew months, therefore, is not so dose as the names would indicate, since these commenced with the new moons, and an intercalary month, Veadar, following their twelfth month Adar, was added.
