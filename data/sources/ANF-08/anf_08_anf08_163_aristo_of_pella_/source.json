Now, Papiscus owns himself convinced by the arguments of Jason, and concludes by a request to be baptized. Celsus, who seems to have been a heathen or an Epicurean, derides the work with scornful commiseration; but Origen rebukes this, and affirms his respect for the work. All this considered, one must think Aristo was \"almost persuaded to be a Christian,\" and deserves a place among Christian writers.","index":"9","references":[]},{"text":"\nFrom the Disputation of Jason and Papiscus.","index":"10","references":[]},{"text":"\"I Remember,\" says Jerome (Comm. ad Gal., cap. iii. comm. 13), \"in the Dispute between Jason and Papiscus, which is composed in Greek, to have found it written: `The execration of God is he that is hanged.'\"","index":"11","references":[]},{"text":"\nFrom the Same Work.","index":"12","references":[]},{"text":"Jerome likewise, in his Hebrew Questions on Genesis, says: \"In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth.
