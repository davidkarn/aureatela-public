He tells us that he was a pupil of Tatian, and expresses an intention of furnishing original solutions of Scriptural problems sated by Tatian,[fn-122-P12267_3591558:5-nf] and by that author explained in a manner apparently unsatisfactory. He also appears to have written against the blasphemous Apelles,[fn-122-P12268_3591723:6-nf] whose HexaÃ«meron was an attempt to refute Moses; but whether he also fulfilled his promise concerning an 'Epi/lusij of Tatian's Problems (or Questions), seems doubtful. Routh has devoted to the fragment here translated six pages of notes,[fn-122-P12269_3592007:7-nf] which he subjoins to the Greek text (of Eusebius) and a Latin version of the same.","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"122","code":"P12264_3591007","folder":"ANF-08","text":"Or Rhodo.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"122","code":"P12265_3591154","folder":"ANF-08","text":"Vol. vii. pp. 333-338, this series, where I neglected to insert a reference to Routh, Rel.

For one of their herd, Apelles, who prides himself on the strictness of his life,[fn-122-P12272_3592345:2-nf] and on his age, admits that there is only one first principle,[fn-122-P12273_3592441:3-nf] yet says that the prophecies have come from an opposing spirit, in which opinion he is influenced by the responses of a soothsaying[fn-122-P12274_3592622:4-nf] maid named Philumene. But others, among whom are Potitus and Basilicus, like Marcion[fn-122-P12275_3592723:5-nf] himself, introduce two first principles. These men, following the Pontic wolf, and not being able to discover any more than he the division of things, have had to recourse to rash assertion, and declared the existence of two first principles simply and without proof. Others of them, again, drifting from bad to worse, assume not two only, but even three natures. Of these men the leader and champion is Syneros, as those who adopt his teaching say....","index":"4","references":[{"fn":"122","code":"P12271_3592144","folder":"ANF-08","text":"The Marcionites.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"122","code":"P12272_3592345","folder":"ANF-08","text":"Politei/a|.

For example, he asserted that men should on no account examine into their creed,[fn-122-P12277_3593504:6-nf] but that every one ought to continue to the last in the belief he has once adopted. For he declared that those who had rested their hope on the Crucified One would be saved, provided only they were found living in the practice, of good works.
