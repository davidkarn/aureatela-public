The Palestinian bishops, after the Jewish downfall, seem to have been the first to comprehend the propriety of adopting the more Catholic usage; and our author presided over a council in Caesarea, of which he was bishop, assisted by Narcissus, bishop of Jerusalem, with Cassius of Tyre and Clarus of Ptolemais, which confirmed it. It is to be noted, that Alexandria is cited by Theophilus as authority for this custom; and it is not quite correct to say that the Western usage prevailed at Nicaea, for it was the general use, save only in Asia Minor and churches which were colonies of the same. This fact has been overlooked, and is very important, in history.","index":"4","references":[{"fn":"124","code":"P12447_3632398","folder":"ANF-08","text":"See (Polycrates) p. 773, supra, and Eusebius, H.E., book v. cap. xxiii., etc. pp. 222-226.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"\nFrom His Epistle on the Question of the Passover, Written in the Name of the Synod of Caesarea.[fn-124-P12450_3633335:1-nf] ","index":"5","references":[{"fn":"124","code":"P12450_3633335","folder":"ANF-08","text":"In Eusebius, Hist.
