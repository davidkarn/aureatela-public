For thus, perhaps, it will not be unfitting to adapt the word of the prophet to our present blessings: \"In the multitude of the sorrows which I had in my heart, the comforts of God,\" by your kindness, \"have refreshed my soul,\"[fn-42-P4267_2801651:1-nf] like sunbeams, cheering and warming our life nipped by frost. For both reached the highest pitch-the severity of my troubles, I mean, on the one side, and the sweetness of your favours on the other. And if you have so gladdened us, by only sending us the joyful tidings of your coming, that everything changed for us from extremest woe to a bright condition, what will your precious and benign coming, even the sight of it, do? what consolation will the sound of your sweet voice in our ears afford our soul? May this speedily come to pass, by the good help of God, Who giveth respite from pain to the fainting, and rest to the afflicted. But be assured, that when we look at our own case we grieve exceedingly at the present state of things, and men cease not to tear us in pieces[fn-42-P4268_2802450:2-nf] : but when we turn our eyes to your excellence, we own that we have great cause for thankfulness to the dispensation of Divine Providence, that we are able to enjoy in your neighbourhood[fn-42-P4269_2802773:3-nf] your sweetness and good-will towards us, and feast at will on such food to satiety, if indeed there is such a thing as satiety of blessings like these.","index":"2","references":[{"fn":"42","code":"P4267_2801651","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Ps. xciv. 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":94,"verses":[19]}]},{"fn":"42","code":"P4268_2802450","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"diaforountaj.
