His superiority in philosophy and classical culture was exhibited, therefore, in his writings, as a necessary preliminary. Like a good nautical combatant, his effort was to \"get to windward,\" and so bear down upon the enemy (to use an anachronism) with heavy-shotted broadsides. And we must not blame Clement for his plan of \"taking the wind out of their sails,\" by showing that an eclectic philosophy might be made to harmonize with the Gospel. His plan was that of melting the gold out of divers ores, and throwing the dross away. Pure gold, he argues, is gold wherever it may be found, and even in the purse of \"thieves and robbers.\" So, then, he \"takes from them the armour in which they trusted, and divides the spoils.\" He will not concede to them the name of \"Gnostics,\" but wrests it from them, just as we reclaim the name of \"Catholics\" from the Tridentine innovators, who have imposed a modern creed (and are constantly adding to it) upon the Latin churches. Here, then, let me quote the Account of Bishop Kaye. He says, \"The object of Clement, in composing the Stromata, was to describe the true `Gnostic, 'or perfect Christian, in order to furnish the believer with a model for his imitation, and to prevent him from being led astray by the representations of the Valentinians and other gnostic sects.\" ... \"Before we proceed to consider his description of the Gnostic, however, it will be necessary briefly to review his opinions respecting the nature and condition of man.\"","index":"19","references":[]},{"text":"Here follows a luminous analysis (occupying pp. 229-238 of Kaye's work), after which he says,-","index":"20","references":[]},{"text":"\"The foregoing brief notice of Clement's opinions respecting man, his soul, and his fallen state, appeared necessary as an introduction to the description of the true Gnostic.

He speaks of a twofold knowledge,-one, common to all men, and born of sense; the other, the genuinegnw=sij, bred from the intellect, the mind, and its reason. This latter is not born with men, but must be gained and by practice formed into a habit.

Demetrius, then bishop, at the times with which we are now concerned, sent Pantaenus to convert the Hindoos, and, whatever his success or failure there, he brought back reports that Christians were there before him, the offspring of St. Bartholomew's preaching; and, in proof thereof, he brought with him a copy of St. Matthew's Gospel in the Hebrew tongue[fn-55-P5551_1683176:350-nf] which became one of the treasures of the church on the Nile.","index":"25","references":[{"fn":"55","code":"P5551_1683176","folder":"ANF-02","text":"See Jones, On the Canon, vol. iii. p. 44","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"But it deserves note, that, because of the learning concentrated in this place, the bishops of Alexandria were, from the beginning, the great authorities as to the Easter cycle and the annual computation of Easter, which new created the science of astronomy as one result.

It is idle, therefore, to shelter under theories of the Disciplina Arcani, those Middle-Age inventions, of which antiquity shows no trace but in many ways contradicts emphatically; e.g., the Eucharist, celebrated after the withdrawal of the non-communicants, and received, in both kinds, by all present, cannot be pleaded as the \"secret\" which justifies a ceremony in an unknown tongue and otherwise utterly different; in which the priest alone partakes, in which the cup is denied to the laity and which is exhibited with great pomp before all comers with no general participation.","index":"30","references":[]},{"text":"\nIV","index":"31","references":[]},{"text":"Esoteric Doctrine.[fn-55-P5566_1686239:353-nf] ","index":"32","references":[{"fn":"55","code":"P5566_1686239","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Book i. cap. i. p. 302, note 5.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"Early Christians, according to Clement, taught to all alike, (1) all things necessary to salvation, (2) all the whole Scriptures, and (3) all the apostolic traditions.

In their instructions to the churches, they were able to say with the same apostle, \"I am pure from the blood of all men, for I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.\" Yet, even in the Church, they fed babes with milk, and the more intelligent with the meat of God's word. What that meat was, we discover in the Stromata, when our author defines the true Gnostic, who follows whithersoever God leads him in the divinely inspired Scriptures.

But the fallacy is obvious. Either they were thus secreted, or they were not. If not, as is most evident (because they contradict what was openly professed), then no ground for the pretence. But suppose they were, what follows? Such secrets were no part of the faith, and could not become so at a later period. If they were kept secret by the new theologians, and taught to \"Gnostics\" only, they would still be without primitive example, but might be less objectionable. But, no! they are imposed upon all, as if part of the ancient creeds; imposed, as if articles of the Catholic faith, on the most illiterate peasant, whose mere doubt as to any of them excludes him from the Church here, and from salvation hereafter.
