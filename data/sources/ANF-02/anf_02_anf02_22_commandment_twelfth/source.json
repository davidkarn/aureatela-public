For wicked desire is wild, and is with difficulty tamed. For it is terrible, and consumes men exceedingly by its wildness. Especially is the servant of God terribly consumed by it, if he falls into it and is devoid of understanding. Moreover, it consumes all such as have not on them the garment of good desire, but are entangled and mixed up with this world. These it delivers up to death.\" \"What then, sir,\" say I, \"are the deeds of wicked desire which deliver men over to death?

You must refrain from evil desires, that by refraining ye may live to God.[fn-6-P618_132915:3-nf] But as many as are mastered by them, and do not resist them, will perish at last, for these desires are fatal.
