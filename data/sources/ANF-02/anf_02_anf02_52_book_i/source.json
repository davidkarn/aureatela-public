On the question arising among the apostles, \"which of them should be the greater,\" Jesus placed a little child in the midst, saying, \"Whosoever, shall humble himself as this little child, the same shall be the greater in the kingdom of heaven.\"[fn-33-P3357_998868:34-nf] He does not then use the appellation of children on account of their very limited amount of understanding from their age, as some have thought. Nor, if He says, \"Except ye become as these children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of God,\" are His words to be understood as meaning \"without learning.\" We, then, who are infants, no longer roll on the ground, nor creep on the earth like serpents as before, crawling with the whole body about senseless lusts; but, stretching upwards in soul, loosed from the world and our sins, touching the earth on tiptoe so as to appear to be in the world, we pursue holy wisdom, although this seems folly to those whose wits are whetted for wickedness. Rightly, then, are those called children who know Him who is God alone as their Father, who are simple, and infants, and guileless, who are lovers of the horns of the unicorns.[fn-33-P3358_999759:35-nf] ","index":"44","references":[{"fn":"33","code":"P3356_998129","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Isa. xl. 11.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":40,"verses":[11]}]},{"fn":"33","code":"P3357_998868","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Matt. xviii. 4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":18,"verses":[4]}]},{"fn":"33","code":"P3358_999759","folder":"ANF-02","text":"It might mean lovers of those promises which are introduced by these words in the marvellous twenty-second Psalm.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"To those, therefore, that have made progress in the word, He has proclaimed this utterance, bidding them dismiss anxious care of the things of this world, and exhorting them to adhere to the Father alone, in imitation of children. Wherefore also in what follows He says: \"Take no anxious thought for the morrow; sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.\"[fn-33-P3360_1000388:36-nf] Thus He enjoins them to lay aside the cares of this life, and depend on the Father alone. And he who fulfils this commandment is in reality a child and a son to God and to the world,-to the one as deceived, to the other as beloved. And if we have one Master in heaven, as the Scripture says, then by common consent those on the earth will be rightly called disciples. For so is the truth, that perfection is with the Lord, who is always teaching, and infancy and childishness with us, who are always learning. Thus prophecy hath honoured perfection, by applying to it the appellation man. For instance, by David, He says of the devil: \"The Lord abhors the man of blood; \"[fn-33-P3361_1001079:37-nf] he calls him man, as perfect in wickedness. And the Lord is called man, because He is perfect in righteousness. Directly in point is the instance of the apostle, who says, writing the Corinthians: \"For I have espoused you to one man, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ,\"[fn-33-P3362_1001382:38-nf] whether as children or saints, but to the Lord alone. And writing to the Ephesians, he has unfolded in the clearest manner the point in question, speaking to the following effect: \"Till we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: that we be no longer children, tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine, by the craft of men, by their cunning in stratagems of deceit; but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up to Him in all things,\"[fn-33-P3363_1001938:39-nf] -saying these things in order to the edification of the body of Christ, who is the head and man, the only one perfect in righteousness; and we who are children guarding against the blasts of heresies, which blow to our inflation; and not putting our trust in fathers who teach us otherwise, are then made perfect when we are the church, having received Christ the head. Then it is right to notice, with respect to the appellation of infant (nh/pioj), that to\\ nh/pion is not predicated of the silly: for the silly man is called nhpu/tioj: and nh/pioj is neh/pioj (since he that is tender-hearted is calledh !pioj), as being one that has newly become gentle and meek in Conduct. This the blessed Paul most clearly pointed out when he said, \"When we might have been burdensome as the apostles of Christ, we were gentle (h !pioi) among you, as a nurse cherisheth her children.\"[fn-33-P3364_1002835:40-nf] The child (nh/pioj) is therefore gentle (h !pioj), and therefore more tender, delicate, and simple, guileless, and destitute of hypocrisy, straightforward and upright in mind, which is the basis of simplicity and truth. For He says, \"Upon whom shall I look, but upon him who is gentle and quiet? \"[fn-33-P3365_1003156:41-nf] For such is the virgin speech, tender, and free of fraud; whence also a virgin is wont to be called \"a tender bride,\" and a child \"tender-hearted.\" And we are tender who are pliant to the power of persuasion, and are easily drawn to goodness, and are mild, and free of the stain of malice and perverseness, for the ancient race was perverse and hard-hearted; but the band of infants, the new people which we are, i.s delicate as a child. On account of the hearts of the innocent, the apostle, in the Epistle to the Romans, owns that he rejoices, and furnishes a kind of definition of children, so to speak, when he says, \"I would have you wise toward good, but simple towards evil.\"[fn-33-P3366_1003858:42-nf] For the name of child, nh/pioj, is not understood by us privatively, though the sons of the grammarians make thenh a privative particle. For if they call us who follow after childhood foolish, see how they utter blasphemy against the Lord, in regarding those as foolish who have betaken themselves to God. But if, which is rather the true sense, they themselves understand the designation children of simple ones, we glory in the name. For the new minds, which have newly become wise, which have sprung into being according to the new covenant, are infantile in the old folly. Of late, then, God was known by the coming of Christ: \"For no man knoweth God but the Son, and he to whom the Son shall reveal Him.\"[fn-33-P3367_1004587:43-nf] ","index":"45","references":[{"fn":"33","code":"P3360_1000388","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Matt. vi. 34.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":6,"verses":[34]}]},{"fn":"33","code":"P3361_1001079","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Ps. v. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":5,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"33","code":"P3362_1001382","folder":"ANF-02","text":"2 Cor. xi. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":11,"verses":[2]}]},{"fn":"33","code":"P3363_1001938","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Eph. iv. 13-15.","bible_refs":[{"book":"ephesians","chapter":4,"verses":[13]}]},{"fn":"33","code":"P3364_1002835","folder":"ANF-02","text":"1 Thess. ii. 6,7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 thessalonians","chapter":2,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"33","code":"P3365_1003156","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Isa. lxvi. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":66,"verses":[2]}]},{"fn":"33","code":"P3366_1003858","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Rom. xvi. 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":16,"verses":[19]}]},{"fn":"33","code":"P3367_1004587","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Matt. xi. 27: Luke x. 22.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":11,"verses":[27]},{"book":"luke","chapter":10,"verses":[22]}]}]},{"text":"In contradistinction, therefore, to the older people, the new people are called young, having learned the new blessings; and we have the exuberance of life's morning prime in this youth which knows no old age, in which we are always growing to maturity in intelligence, are always young, always mild, always new: for those must necessarily be new, who have become partakers of the new Word. And that which participates in eternity is wont to be assimilated to the incorruptible: so that to us appertains the designation of the age of childhood, a lifelong spring-time, because the truth that is in us, and our habits saturated with the truth, cannot be touched by old age; but Wisdom is ever blooming, ever remains consistent and the same, and never changes. \"Their children,\" it is said, \"shall be borne upon their shoulders, and fondled on their knees; as one whom his mother comforteth, so also shall I comfort you.\"[fn-33-P3369_1005538:44-nf] The mother draws the children to herself; and we seek our mother the Church. Whatever is feeble and tender, as needing help on account of its feebleness, is kindly looked on, and is sweet and pleasant, anger changing into help in the case of such: for thus horses' colts, and the little calves of cows, and the lion's whelp, and the stag's fawn, and the child of man, are looked upon with pleasure by their fathers and mothers. Thus also the Father of the universe cherishes affection towards those who have fled to Him; and having begotten them again by His Spirit to the adoption of children, knows them as gentle, and loves those alone, and aids and fights for them; and therefore He bestows on them the name of child. The word Isaac I also connect with child. Isaac means laughter. He was seen sporting with his wife and helpmeet Rebecca by the prying king.[fn-33-P3370_1006423:45-nf] The king, whose name was Abimelech, appears to me to represent a supramundane wisdom contemplating the mystery of sport. They interpret Rebecca to mean endurance. O wise sport, laughter also assisted by endurance, and the king as spectator! The spirit of those that are children in Christ, whose lives are ordered in endurance, rejoice. And this is the divine sport. \"Such a sport, of his own, Jove sports,\" says Heraclitus. For what other employment is seemly for a wise and perfect man, than to sport and be glad in the endurance of what is good-and, in the administration of what is good, holding festival with God? That which is signified by the prophet may be interpreted differently,-namely, of our rejoicing for salvation, as Isaac. He also, delivered from death, laughed, sporting and rejoicing with his spouse, who was the type of the Helper of our salvation, the Church, to whom the stable name of endurance is given; for this cause surely, because she alone remains to all generations, rejoicing ever, subsisting as she does by the endurance of us believers, who are the members of Christ. And the witness of those that have endured to the end, and the rejoicing on their account, is the mystic sport, and the salvation accompanied with decorous solace which brings us aid. The King, then, who is Christ, beholds from above our laughter, and looking through the window, as the Scripture says, views the thanksgiving, and the blessing, and the rejoicing, and the gladness, and furthermore the endurance which works together with them and their embrace: views His Church, showing only His face, which was wanting to the Church, which is made perfect by her royal Head. And where, then, was the door by which the Lord showed Himself? The flesh by which He was manifested. He is Isaac (for the narrative may be interpreted otherwise), who is a type of the Lord, a child as a son; for he was the son of Abraham, as Christ the Son of God, and a sacrifice as the Lord, but he was not immolated as the Lord. Isaac only bore the wood of the sacrifice, as the Lord the wood of the cross. And he laughed mystically, prophesying that the Lord should fill us with joy, who have been redeemed from corruption by the blood of the Lord. Isaac did everything but suffer, as was right, yielding the precedence in suffering to the Word. Furthermore, there is an intimation of the divinity of the Lord in His not being slain. For Jesus rose again after His burial, having suffered no harm, like Isaac released from sacrifice. And in defence of the point to be established, I shall adduce another consideration of the greatest weight. The Spirit calls the Lord Himself a child, thus prophesying by Esaias: \"Lo, to us a child has been born, to us a son has been given, on whose own shoulder the government shall be; and His name has been called the Angel of great Counsel.\" Who, then, is this infant child? He according to whose image we are made little children. By the same prophet is declared His greatness: \"Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace; that He might fulfil His discipline: and of His peace there shall be no end.\"[fn-33-P3371_1009594:46-nf] O the great God! O the perfect child! The Son in the Father, and the Father in the Son. And how shall not the discipline of this child be perfect, which extends to all, leading as a schoolmaster us as children who are His little ones? He has stretched forth to us those hands of His that are conspicuously worthy of trust. To this child additional testimony is borne by John, \"the greatest prophet among those born of women: \"[fn-33-P3372_1010038:47-nf] Behold the Lamb of God!\"[fn-33-P3373_1010082:48-nf] For since Scripture calls the infant children lambs, it has also called Him-God the Word-who became man for our sakes, and who wished in all points to be made like to u\"-\"the Lamb of God\"-Him, namely, that is the Son of God, the child of the Father.","index":"46","references":[{"fn":"33","code":"P3369_1005538","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Isa. lxvi. 12,13.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":66,"verses":[12]}]},{"fn":"33","code":"P3370_1006423","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Gen. xxvi. 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":26,"verses":[8]}]},{"fn":"33","code":"P3371_1009594","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Isa. ix. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":9,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"33","code":"P3372_1010038","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Luke vii. 28.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":7,"verses":[28]}]},{"fn":"33","code":"P3373_1010082","folder":"ANF-02","text":"John i. 29,36.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":1,"verses":[29]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter VI.-The Name Children Does Not Imply Instruction in Elementary Principles.","index":7,"paragraphs":[{"text":"We have ample means of encountering those who are given to carping.

If the latter, there is some addition He requires yet to make. But for Him to make any addition to His knowledge is absurd, since He is God. For none can be superior to the Word, or the teacher of the only Teacher. Will they not then own, though reluctant, that the perfect Word born of the perfect Father was begotten in perfection, according to oeconomic fore-ordination? And if He was perfect, why was He, the perfect one, baptized? It was necessary, they say, to fulfil the profession that pertained to humanity. Most excellent. Well, I assert, simultaneously with His baptism by John, He becomes perfect? Manifestly. He did not then learn anything more from him? Certainly not. But He is perfected by the washing-of baptism-alone, and is sanctified by the descent of the Spirit? Such is the case. The same also takes place in our case, whose exemplar Christ became. Being baptized, we are illuminated; illuminated, we become sons; being made sons, we are made perfect; being made perfect, we are made immortal. \"I,\" says He, \"have said that ye are gods, and all sons of the Highest.\"[fn-33-P3378_1012409:50-nf] This work is variously called grace,[fn-33-P3379_1012466:51-nf] and illumination, and perfection, and washing: washing, by which we cleanse away our sins; grace, by which the penalties accruing to transgressions are remitted; and illumination, by which that holy light of salvation is beheld, that is, by which we see God clearly. Now we call that perfect which wants nothing. For what is yet wanting to him who knows God? For it were truly monstrous that that which is not complete should be called a gift (or act) of God's grace. Being perfect, He consequently bestows perfect gifts. As at His command all things were made, so on His bare wishing to bestow grace, ensues the perfecting of His grace.

This is the eternal adjustment of the vision, which is able to see the eternal light, since like loves like; and that which is holy, loves that from which holiness proceeds, which has appropriately been termed light. \"Once ye were darkness, now are ye light in the Lord.\"[fn-33-P3386_1015287:56-nf] Hence I am of opinion man was called by the ancientsfw/j.[fn-33-P3387_1015361:57-nf] But he has not yet received, say they, the perfect gift. I also assent to this; but he is in the light, and the darkness comprehendeth him not. There is nothing intermediate between light and darkness. But the end is reserved till the resurrection of those who believe; and it is not the reception of some other thing, but the obtaining of the promise previously made. For we do not say that both take place together at the same time-both the arrival at the end, and the anticipation of that arrival. For eternity and time are not the same, neither is the attempt and the final result; but both have reference to the same thing, and one and the same person is concerned in both. Faith, so to speak, is the attempt generated in time; the final result is the attainment of the promise, secured for eternity. Now the Lord Himself has most clearly revealed the equality of salvation, when He said: \"For this is the will of my Father, that every one that seeth the Son, and believeth on Him, should have everlasting life; and I will raise him up in the last day.\"[fn-33-P3388_1016450:58-nf] As far as possible in this world, which is what he means by the last day, and which is preserved till the time that it shall end, we believe that we are made perfect. Wherefore He says, \"He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life.\"[fn-33-P3389_1016708:59-nf] If, then, those who have believed have life, what remains beyond the possession of eternal life? Nothing is wanting to faith, as it is perfect and complete in itself. If aught is wanting to it, it is not wholly perfect. But faith is not lame in any respect; nor after our departure from this world does it make us who have believed, and received without distinction the earnest of future good, wait; but having in anticipation grasped by faith that which is future, after the resurrection we receive it as present, in order that that may be fulfilled which was spoken, \"Be it according to thy faith.\"[fn-33-P3390_1017328:60-nf] And where faith is, there is the promise; and the consummation of the promise is rest. So that in illumination what we receive is knowledge, and the end of knowledge is rest-the last thing conceived as the object of aspiration. As, then, inexperience comes to an end by experience, and perplexity by finding a clear outlet, so by illumination must darkness disappear. The darkness is ignorance, through which we fall into sins, purblind as to the truth. Knowledge, then, is the illumination we receive, which makes ignorance disappear, and endows us with clear vision. Further, the abandonment of what is bad is the adopting[fn-33-P3391_1017972:61-nf] of what is better. For what ignorance has bound ill, is by knowledge loosed well; those bonds are with all speed slackened by human faith and divine grace, our transgressions being taken away by one Poeonian[fn-33-P3392_1018257:62-nf] medicine, the baptism of the Word. We are washed from all our sins, and are no longer entangled in evil. This is the one grace of illumination, that our characters are not the same as before our washing. And since knowledge springs up with illumination, shedding its beams around the mind, the moment we hear, we who were untaught become disciples. Does this, I ask, take place on the advent of this instruction? You cannot tell the time. For instruction leads to faith, and faith with baptism is trained by the Holy Spirit. For that faith is the one universal salvation of humanity, and that there is the same equality before the righteous and loving God, and the same fellowship between Him and all, the apostle most clearly showed, speaking to the following effect: \"Before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed, so that the law became our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith; but after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.\"[fn-33-P3393_1019327:63-nf] Do you not hear that we are no longer under that law which was accompanied with fear, but under the Word, the master of free choice? Then he subjoined the utterance, clear of all partiality: \"For ye are all the children of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\"[fn-33-P3394_1020084:64-nf] There are not, then, in the same Word some \"illuminated (gnostics); and some animal (or natural) men; \"but all who have abandoned the desires of the flesh are equal and spiritual before the Lord. And again he writes in another place: \"For by one spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free, and we have all drunk of one cup.\"[fn-33-P3395_1020475:65-nf] Nor were it absurd to employ the expressions of those who call the reminiscence of better things the filtration of the spirit, understanding by filtration the separation of what is baser, that results from the reminiscence of what is better. There follows of necessity, in him who has come to the recollection of what is better, repentance for what is worse. Accordingly, they confess that the spirit in repentance retraces its steps. In the same way, therefore, we also, repenting of our sins, renouncing our iniquities, purified by baptism, speed back to the eternal light, children to the Father. Jesus therefore, rejoicing in the spirit, said: \"I thank Thee, O Father, God of heaven and earth, that Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes; \"[fn-33-P3396_1021288:66-nf] the Master and Teacher applying the name babes to us, who are readier to embrace salvation than the wise in the world, who, thinking themselves wise, are inflated with pride. And He exclaims in exultation and exceeding joy, as if lisping with the children, \"Even so, Father; for so it seemed good in Thy sight.\"[fn-33-P3397_1021617:67-nf] Wherefore those things which have been concealed from the wise and prudent of this present world have been revealed to babes. Truly, then, are we the children of God, who have put aside the old man, and stripped off the garment of wickedness, and put on the immortality of Christ; that we may become a new, holy people by regeneration, and may keep the man undefiled. And a babe, as God's little one,[fn-33-P3398_1022035:68-nf] is cleansed from fornication and wickedness. With the greatest clearness the blessed Paul has solved for us this question in his First Epistle to the Corinthians, writing thus: \"Brethren, be not children in understanding; howbeit in malice be children, but in understanding be men.\"[fn-33-P3399_1022507:69-nf] And the expression, \"When I was a child, I thought as a child, I spoke as a child,\"[fn-34-P3400_1022612:70-nf] points out his mode of life according to the law, according to which, thinking childish things, he persecuted, and speaking childish things he blasphemed the Word, not as having yet attained to the simplicity of childhood, but as being in its folly; for the wordnh/pion has two meanings.[fn-34-P3401_1022993:71-nf] \"When I became a man,\" again Paul says, \"I put away childish things.\"[fn-34-P3402_1023129:72-nf] It is not incomplete size of stature, nor a definite measure of time, nor additional secret teachings in things that are manly and more perfect, that the apostle, who himself professes to be a preacher of childishness, alludes to when he sends it, as it were, into banishment; but he applies the name \"children\" to those who are under the law, who are terrified by fear as children are by bugbears; and \"men\" to us who are obedient to the Word and masters of ourselves, who have believed, and are saved by voluntary choice, and are rationally, not irrationally, frightened by terror. Of this the apostle himself shall testify, calling as he does the Jews heirs according to the first covenant, and us heirs according to promise: Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; but is under tutors and governors, till the time appointed by the father. So also we, when we were children, were in bondage under the rudiments of the world: but when the fulness of the time was came, God sent forth His Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons \"[fn-34-P3403_1024335:73-nf] by Him. See how He has admitted those to be children who are under fear and sins; but has conferred manhood on those who are under faith, by calling them sons, in contradistinction from the children that are under the law: \"For thou art no more a servant,\" he says, \"but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.\"[fn-34-P3404_1024673:74-nf] What, then, is lacking to the son after inheritance? Wherefore the expression, \"When I was a child,\" may be elegantly expounded thus: that is, when I was a Jew (for he was a Hebrew by extraction) I thought as a child, when I followed the law; but after becoming a man, I no longer entertain the sentiments of a child, that is, of the law, but of a man, that is, of Christ, whom alone the Scripture calls man, as we have said before. \"I put away childish things.\" But the childhood which is in Christ is maturity, as compared with the law. Having reached this point, we must defend our childhood. And we have still to explain what is said by the apostle: \"I have fed you with milk (as children in Christ), not with meat; for ye were not able, neither yet are ye now able.\"[fn-34-P3405_1025462:75-nf] For it does not appear to me that the expression is to be taken in a Jewish sense; for I shall oppose to it also that Scripture, \"I will bring you into that good land which flows with milk and honey.\"[fn-34-P3406_1025683:76-nf] A very great difficulty arises in reference to the comparison of these Scriptures, when we consider. For if the infancy which is characterized by the milk is the beginning of faith in Christ, then it is disparaged as childish and imperfect. How is the rest that comes after the meat, the rest of the man who is perfect and endowed with knowledge, again distinguished by infant milk? Does not this, as explaining a parable, mean something like this, and is not the expression to be read somewhat to the following effect: \"I have fed you with milk in Christ; \"and after a slight stop, let us add, \"as children,\" that by separating the words in reading we may make out some such sense as this: I have instructed you in Christ with simple, true, and natural nourishment,-namely, that which is spiritual: for such is the nourishing substance of milk swelling out from breasts of love. So that the whole matter may be conceived thus: As nurses nourish new-born children on milk, so do I also by the Word, the milk of Christ, instilling into you spiritual nutriment.","index":"50","references":[{"fn":"33","code":"P3386_1015287","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Eph. v. 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"ephesians","chapter":5,"verses":[8]}]},{"fn":"33","code":"P3387_1015361","folder":"ANF-02","text":"fwj, light; fw/j, a man.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"33","code":"P3388_1016450","folder":"ANF-02","text":"John vi. 40.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":6,"verses":[40]}]},{"fn":"33","code":"P3389_1016708","folder":"ANF-02","text":"John iii. 36.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":3,"verses":[36]}]},{"fn":"33","code":"P3390_1017328","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Matt. ix. 29.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":9,"verses":[29]}]},{"fn":"33","code":"P3391_1017972","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Migne's text has a0poka/luyij.

How then are we not to regard the apostle as attaching this sense to the milk of the babes? And if we who preside over the Churches are shepherds after the image of the good Shepherd, and you the sheep, are we not to regard the Lord as preserving consistency in the use of figurative speech, when He speaks also of the milk of the flock? And to this meaning we may secondly accommodate the expression, \"I have given you milk to drink, and not given you food, for ye are not yet able,\" regarding the meat not as something different from the milk, but the same in substance. For the very same Word is fluid and mild as milk, or solid and compact as meat. And entertaining this view, we may regard the proclamation of the Gospel, which is universally diffused, as milk; and as meat, faith, which from instruction is compacted into a foundation, which, being more substantial than hearing, is likened to meat, and assimilates to the soul itself nourishment of this kind. Elsewhere the Lord, in the Gospel according to John, brought this out by symbols, when He said: \"Eat ye my flesh, and drink my blood; \"[fn-34-P3419_1030897:87-nf] describing distinctly by metaphor the drinkable properties of faith and the promise, by means of which the Church, like a human being consisting of many members, is refreshed and grows, is welded together and compacted of both,-of faith, which is the body, and of hope, which is the soul; as also the Lord of flesh and blood. For in reality the blood of faith is hope, in which faith is held as by a vital principle. And when hope expires, it is as if blood flowed forth; and the vitality of faith is destroyed. If, then, some would oppose, saying that by milk is meant the first lesson\"-as it were, the first food-and that by meat is meant those spiritual cognitions to which they attain by raising themselves to knowledge, let them understand that, in saying that meat is solid food, and the flesh and blood of Jesus, they are brought by their own vainglorious wisdom to the true simplicity. For the blood is found to be an original product in man, and some have consequently ventured to call it the substance of the soul. And this blood, transmuted by a natural process of assimilation in the pregnancy of the mother, through the sympathy of parental affection, effloresces and grows old, in order that there may be no fear for the child. Blood, too, is the moister part of flesh, being a kind of liquid flesh; and milk is the sweeter and finer part of blood. For whether it be the blood supplied to the foetus, and sent through the navel of the mother, or whether it be the menses themselves shut out from their proper passage, and by a natural diffusion, bidden by the all-nourishing and creating God, proceed to the already swelling breasts, and by the heat of the spirits transmuted, [whether it be the one or the other] that is formed, into food desirable for the babe, that which is changed is the blood. For of all the members, the breasts have the most sympathy with the womb. When there is parturition, the vessel by which blood was conveyed to the foetus is cut off: there is an obstruction Of the flow, and the blood receives an impulse towards the breasts; and on a considerable rush taking place, they are distended, and change the blood to milk in a manner analogous to the change of blood into pus in ulceration. Or if, on the other hand, the blood from the veins in the vicinity of the breasts, which have been opened in pregnancy, is poured into the natural hollows of the breasts; and the spirit discharged from the neighbouring arteries being mixed with it, the substance of the blood, still remaining pure, it becomes white by being agitated like a wave; and by an interruption such as this is changed by frothing it, like what takes place with the sea, which at the assaults of the winds, the poets say, \"spits forth briny foam.\" Yet still the essence is supplied by the blood.","index":"52","references":[{"fn":"34","code":"P3418_1029692","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Jer. ix. 23; 1 Cor. i. 31; 2 Cor. x. 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":1,"verses":[31]},{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":10,"verses":[17]},{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":1,"verses":[31]},{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":10,"verses":[17]},{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":1,"verses":[31]},{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":10,"verses":[17]}]},{"fn":"34","code":"P3419_1030897","folder":"ANF-02","text":"John vi. 34.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":6,"verses":[34]}]}]},{"text":"In this way also the rivers, borne on with rushing motion, and fretted by contact with the surrounding air, murmur forth foam.

For the breasts are not like fountains full of milk, flowing in ready prepared; but, by effecting a change in the nutriment, form the milk in themselves, and discharge it. And the nutriment suitable and wholesome for the new-formed and new-born babe is elaborated by God, the nourisher and the Father of all that are generated and regenerated,-as manna, the celestial food of angels, flowed down from heaven on the ancient Hebrews. Even now, in fact, nurses call the first-poured drink of milk by the same name as that food-manna. Further, pregnant women, on becoming mothers, discharge milk. But the Lord Christ, the fruit of the Virgin, did not pronounce the breasts of women blessed, nor selected them to give nourishment; but when the kind and loving Father had rained down the Word, Himself became spiritual nourishment to the good. O mystic marvel! The universal Father is one, and one the universal Word; and the Holy Spirit is one and the same everywhere, and one is the only virgin mother. I love to call her the Church. This mother, when alone, had not milk, because alone she was not a woman. But she is once virgin and mother-pure as a virgin, loving as a mother. And calling her children to her, she nurses them with holy milk, viz., with the Word for childhood. Therefore she had not milk; for the milk was this child fair and comely, the body of Christ, which nourishes by the Word the young brood, which the Lord Himself brought forth in throes of the flesh, which the Lord Himself swathed in His precious blood.

Hear it also in the following way. The flesh figuratively represents to us the Holy Spirit; for the flesh was created by Him. The blood points out to us the Word, for as rich blood the Word has been infused into life; and the union of both is the Lord, the food of the babes-the Lord who is Spirit and Word. The food-that is, the Lord Jesus-that is, the Word of God, the Spirit made flesh, the heavenly flesh sanctified. The nutriment is the milk of the Father, by which alone we infants are nourished. The Word Himself, then, the beloved One, and our nourisher, hath shed His own blood for us, to save humanity; and by Him, we, believing on God, flee to the Word, \"the care-soothing breast\" of the Father. And He alone, as is befitting, supplies us children with the milk of love, and those only are truly Messed who suck this breast. Wherefore also Peter says: \"Laying therefore aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisy, and envy, and evil speaking, as new-born babes, desire the milk of the word, that ye may grow by it to salvation; if ye have tasted that the Lord is Christ.\"[fn-34-P3425_1038070:90-nf] And were one to concede to them that the meat was something different from the milk, then how shall they avoid being transfixed on their own spit, through want of consideration of nature?[fn-34-P3426_1038351:91-nf] For in winter, when the air is condensed, and prevents the escape of the heat enclosed within, the food, transmuted and digested and changed into blood, passes into the veins, and these, in the absence of exhalation, are greatly distended, and exhibit strong pulsations; consequently also nurses are then fullest of milk. And we have shown a little above, that on pregnancy blood passes into milk by a change which does not affect its substance, just as in old people yellow hair changes to grey. But again in summer, the body, having its pores more open, affords greater facility for diaphoretic action in the case of the food, and the milk is least abundant, since neither is the blood full, nor is the whole nutriment retained. If, then, the digestion of the food results in the production of blood, and the blood becomes milk, then blood is a preparation for milk, as blood is for a human being, and the grape for the vine. With milk, then, the Lord's nutriment, we are nursed directly we are born; and as soon as we are regenerated, we are honoured by receiving the good news of the hope of rest, even the Jerusalem above, in which it is written that milk and honey fall in showers, receiving through what is material the pledge of the sacred food. \"For meats are done away with,\"[fn-34-P3427_1039763:92-nf] as the apostle himself says; but this nourishment on milk leads to the heavens, rearing up citizens of heaven, and members of the angelic choirs. And since the Word is the gushing fountain of life, and has been called a river of olive oil, Paul, using appropriate figurative language, and calling Him milk, adds: \"I have given you to drink; \"[fn-34-P3428_1040126:93-nf] for we drink in the word, the nutriment of the truth. In truth, also liquid food is called drink; and the same thing may somehow be both meat and drink, according to the different aspects in which it is considered, just as cheese is the solidification of milk or milk solidified; for I am not concerned here to make a nice selection of an expression, only to say that one substance supplies both articles of food. Besides, for children at the breast, milk alone suffices; it serves both for meat and drink. \"I,\" says the Lord, \"have meat to eat that ye know not of. My meat is to do the will of Him that sent Me.\"[fn-34-P3429_1040761:94-nf] You see another kind of food which, similarly with milk, represents figuratively the will of God. Besides, also, the completion of His own passion He called catachrestically \"a cup,\"[fn-34-P3430_1040965:95-nf] when He alone had to drink and drain it. Thus to Christ the fulfilling of His Father's will was food; and to us infants,who drink the milk of the word of the heavens, Christ Himself is food.

But the inculpatory and dehortatory forms of speech have been already shown us; and we must now handle the persuasive and the laudatory, and, as on a beam, balance the equal scales of justice. The exhortation to what is useful, the Instructor employs by Solomon, to the following effect: \"I exhort you, O men; and I utter my voice to the sons of men. Hear me; for I will speak of excellent things; \"[fn-36-P3646_1100960:235-nf] and so on.

The second, whose meaning is understood from the present times, as being apprehended by perception; as it was said to those who asked the Lord, \"If He was the Christ, or shall we wait for another?

He invites us to knowledge also, when He says by Jeremiah, \"Hadst thou walked in the way of God, thou wouldst have dwelt for ever in peace; \"[fn-36-P3662_1105101:250-nf] for, exhibiting there the reward of knowledge, He calls the wise to the love of it. And, granting pardon to him who has erred, He says, \"Turn, turn, as a grape-gatherer to his basket.\"[fn-36-P3663_1105309:251-nf] Do you see the goodness of justice, in that it counsels to repentance? And still further, by Jeremiah, He enlightens in the truth those who have erred. \"Thus saith the Lord, Stand in the ways, and look, and ask for the eternal paths of the Lord, what is the good path, and walk in it, and ye shall find purification for your souls.\"[fn-36-P3664_1105661:252-nf] And in order to promote our salvation, He leads us to repentance. Wherefore He says, \"If thou repent, the Lord will purify thy heart, and the heart of thy seed.\"[fn-36-P3665_1105843:253-nf] We might have adduced, as supporters on this question, the philosophers who say that only the perfect man is worthy of praise, and the bad man of blame. But since some slander beatitude, as neither itself taking any trouble, nor giving any to any one else, thus not understanding its love to man; on their account, and on account of those who do not associate justice with goodness, the following remarks are added. For it were a legitimate inference to say, that rebuke and censure are suitable to men, since they say that all men are bad; but God alone is wise, from whom cometh wisdom, and alone perfect, and therefore alone worthy of praise. But I do not employ such language. I say, then, that praise or blame, or whatever resembles praise or blame, are medicines most essential of all to men. Some are ill to cure, and, like iron, are wrought into shape with fire, and hammer, and anvil, that is, with threatening, and reproof, and chastisement; while others, cleaving to faith itself, as self-taught, and as acting of their own free-will, grow by praise:-","index":"128","references":[{"fn":"36","code":"P3652_1102743","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Ezek. xviii., xxxiii.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"36","code":"P3653_1102869","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Matt. xi. 28.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":11,"verses":[28]}]},{"fn":"36","code":"P3654_1103102","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Prov. iii. 13.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","chapter":3,"verses":[13]}]},{"fn":"36","code":"P3655_1103217","folder":"ANF-02","text":"In Prov. ii. 4, 5; iii. 15.

According to which image also we ought, conforming ourselves to the Instructor, and making the word and our deeds agree, to live a real life.","index":"144","references":[{"fn":"36","code":"P3695_1115075","folder":"ANF-02","text":"The secondary, civilizing, and socializing power of the Gospel, must have already produced all this change from heathen manners, under Clement's own observation.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter XIII.-Virtue Rational, Sin Irrational.","index":14,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Everything that is contrary to right reason is sin. Accordingly, therefore, the philosophers think fit to define the most generic passions thus: lust, as desire disobedient to reason ; fear, as weakness disobedient to reason; pleasure, as an elation of the spirit disobedient to reason. If, then, disobedience in reference to reason is the generating cause of sin, how shall we escape the conclusion, that obedience to reason-the Word-which we call faith, will of necessity be the efficacious cause of duty? For virtue itself is a state of the soul rendered harmonious by reason in respect to the whole life. Nay, to crown all, philosophy itself is pronounced to be the cultivation of right reason; so that, necessarily, whatever is done through error of reason is transgression, and is rightly called, (a9ma/rthma) sin. Since, then, the first man sinned and disobeyed God, it is said, \"And man became like to the beasts: \"[fn-36-P3699_1117737:266-nf] being rightly regarded as irrational, he is likened to the beasts.

What is fitting is incumbent. And obedience is founded on commands. And these being, as they are, the same as counsel-having truth for their aim, train up to the ultimate goal of aspiration, which is conceived of as the end (te/loj). And the end of piety is eternal rest in God. And the beginning of eternity is our end. The right operation of piety perfects duty by works; whence, according to just reasoning, duties consist in actions, not in sayings. And Christian conduct is the Operation of the rational soul in accordance with a correct judgment and aspiration after the truth, which attains its destined end through the body, the soul's consort and ally.[fn-37-P3702_1119043:268-nf] Virtue is a will in conformity to God and Christ in life, rightly adjusted to life everlasting. For the life of Christians, in which we are now trained, is a system of reasonable actions-that is, of those things taught by the Word-an unfailing energy which we have called faith. The system is the commandments of the Lord, which, being divine statues and spiritual counsels, have been written for ourselves, being adapted for ourselves and our neighbours. Moreover, they turn back on us, as the ball rebounds on him that throws it by the repercussion. Whence also duties are essential for divine discipline, as being enjoined by God, and furnished for our salvation. And since, of those things which are necessary, some relate only to life here, and others, which relate to the blessed life yonder, wing us for flight hence; so, in an analogous manner, of duties, some are ordained with reference to life, others for the blessed life. The commandments issued with respect to natural life are published to the multitude; but those that are suited for living well, and from which eternal life springs, we have to consider, as in a sketch, as we read them out of the Scriptures.
