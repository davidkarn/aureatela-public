For if you exercise restraint in the doing of good, you will commit a great sin;[fn-5-P558_112388:2-nf] but if you exercise restraint, so as not to do that which is evil, you are practising great righteousness. Restrain yourself, therefore, from all iniquity, and do that which is good.\" \"What, sir,\" say I, \"are the evil deeds from which we must restrain ourselves? \"\"Hear,\" says he: \"from adultery and fornication, from unlawful revelling,[fn-5-P559_112757:3-nf] from wicked luxury, from indulgence in many kinds of food and the extravagance of riches, and from boastfulness, and haughtiness, and insolence, and lies, and backbiting, and hypocrisy, from the remembrance of wrong, and from all slander. These are the deeds that are most wicked in the life of men. From all these deeds, therefore, the servant of God must restrain himself. For he who does not restrain himself from these, cannot live to God. Listen, then, to the deeds that accompany these.\" \"Are there, sir,\" said I, \"any other evil deeds? \"\"There are,\" says he; \"and many of them, too, from which the servant of God must restrain himself-theft, lying, robbery, false witness, overreaching, wicked lust, deceit, vainglory, boastfulness, and all other vices like to these.\" \"Do you not think that these are really wicked? \"\"Exceedingly wicked in the servants of God. From all of these the servant of God must restrain himself. Restrain yourself, then, from all these, that you may live to God, and you will be enrolled amongst those who restrain themselves in regard to these matters. These, then, are the things from which you must restrain yourself.\"","index":"4","references":[{"fn":"5","code":"P557_111868","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Command. vi. cap. i. p. 24, supra.

First of all[fn-5-P561_114409:4-nf] there is faith, then fear of the Lord, love, concord, words of righteousness, truth, patience. Than these, nothing is better in the life of men. If any one attend to these, and restrain himself not from them, blessed is he in his life. Then there are the following attendant on these: helping widows, looking after orphans and the needy, rescuing the servants of God from necessities, the being hospitable-for in hospitality good-doing finds a field-never opposing any one, the being quiet, having fewer needs than all men, reverencing the aged, practising righteousness, watching the brotherhood, bearing insolence, being long-suffering, encouraging those who are sick in soul, not casting those who have fallen into sin from the faith, but turning them back and restoring them to peace of mind, admonishing sinners, not oppressing debtors and the needy, and if there are any other actions like these.[fn-5-P562_115441:5-nf] Do these seem to you good? \"says he. \"For what, sir,\" say I, \"is better than these? \"\"Walk then in them,\" says he, \"and restrain not yourself from them, and you will live to God.[fn-5-P563_115749:6-nf] Keep, therefore, this commandment.
