A certain man had a field and many slaves, and he planted a certain part of the field with a vineyard,[fn-7-P708_156879:3-nf] and selecting a faithful and beloved and much valued slave, he called him to him, and said, `Take this vineyard which I have planted, and stake[fn-7-P709_157067:4-nf] it until I come, and do nothing else to the vineyard; and attend to this order of mine, and you shall receive your freedom from me.'And the master of the slave departed to a foreign country. And when he was gone, the slave took and staked the vineyard; and when he had finished the staking of the vines, he saw that the vineyard was full of weeds. He then reflected, saying, `I have kept this order of my master: I will dig up the rest of this vineyard, and it will be more beautiful when dug up; and being free of weeds, it will yield more fruit, not being choked by them.'He took, therefore, and dug up the vineyard, and rooted out all the weeds that were in it. And that vineyard became very beautiful and fruitful, Having no weeds to choke it. And after a certain time the master of the slave and of the field returned, and entered into the vineyard. And seeing that the vines were suitably supported on stakes, and the ground, moreover, dug up, and all the weeds rooted out, and the vines fruitful, he was greatly pleased with the work of his slave. And calling his beloved son who was his heir, and his friends who were his councillors, he told them what orders he had given his slave, and what he had found performed. And they rejoiced along with the slave at the testimony which his master bore to him. And he said to them, `I promised this slave freedom if he obeyed the command which I gave him; and he has kept my command, and done besides a good work to the vineyard, and has pleased me exceedingly. In return, therefore, for the work which he has done, I wish to make him co-heir with my son, because, having good thoughts, he did not neglect them, but carried them out.'With this resolution of the master his son and friends were well pleased, viz., that the slave should be co-heir with the son. After a few days the master made a feast,[fn-7-P710_158957:5-nf] and sent to his slave many dishes from his table. And the slave receiving the dishes that were sent him from his master, took of them what was sufficient for himself, and distributed the rest among his fellow-slaves. And his fellow-slaves rejoiced to receive the dishes, and began to pray for him, that he might find still greater favour with his master for having so treated them. His master heard all these things that were done, and was again greatly pleased with his conduct. And the master again calling; together his friends and his son, reported to them the slave's proceeding with regard to the dishes which he had sent him. And they were still more satisfied that the slave should become co-heir with his son.\"","index":"14","references":[{"fn":"7","code":"P708_156879","folder":"ANF-02","text":"The Vatican adds, \"for his successors.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"7","code":"P709_157067","folder":"ANF-02","text":"i.e., attach the vines to stakes.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"7","code":"P710_158957","folder":"ANF-02","text":"The gospel parables of the vineyard, and of the sower, and of the man travelling into a far country, are here reflected passim.
