Cyprian to Januarius, Maximus, Proculus, Victor, Modianus, Nemesianus, Nampulus, and Honoratus, his brethren, greeting. With excessive grief of mind, and not without tears, dearest, brethren, I have read your letter which you wrote to me from the solicitude of your love, concerning the captivity of our brethren and sisters. For who would not grieve at misfortunes of that kind, or who would not consider his brother's grief his own, since the Apostle Paul speaks, saying, \"Whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member rejoice, all the members rejoice with it; \"[fn-58-P5897_1849749:3-nf] and in another place he says, \"Who is weak, and I am not weak? \"[fn-58-P5898_1849833:4-nf] Wherefore now also the captivity of our brethren must be reckoned as our captivity, and the grief of those who are endangered is to be esteemed as our grief, since indeed there is one body of our union; and not love only, but also religion, ought to instigate and strengthen us to redeem the members of the brethren.","index":"6","references":[{"fn":"58","code":"P5897_1849749","folder":"ANF-05","text":"1 Cor. xii. 26.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":12,"verses":[26]}]},{"fn":"58","code":"P5898_1849833","folder":"ANF-05","text":"2 Cor. xi. 29.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":11,"verses":[29]}]}]},{"text":"2. For inasmuch as the Apostle Paul says again, \"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? \"[fn-59-P5900_1850305:5-nf] -even although love urged us less to bring help to the brethren, yet in this place we must have considered that it was the temples of God which were taken captive, and that we ought not by long inactivity and neglect of their suffering to allow the temples of God to be long captive, but to strive with what powers we can, and to act quickly by our obedience, to deserve well of Christ our Judge and Lord and God. For as the Apostle Paul says, \"As many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ,\"[fn-59-P5901_1850839:6-nf] Christ is to be contemplated in our captive brethren, and He is to be redeemed from the peril of captivity who redeemed us from the peril of death; so that He who took us out of the jaws of the devil, who abides and dwells in us, may now Himself be rescued and redeemed from the hands of barbarians by a sum of money-who redeemed us by His cross and blood-who suffers these things to happen for this reason, that our faith may be tried, whether each one of us will do for another what he would wish to be done for himself, if he himself were held captive among barbarians. For who that is mindful of humanity, and reminded of mutual love, if he be a father, will not now consider that his sons are there; if he be a husband, will not think that his wife is there kept captive, with as much grief as shame for the marriage tie? But how great is the general grief among all of us, and suffering concerning the peril of virgins who are kept there, on whose behalf we must bewail not only the loss of liberty, but of modesty; and must lament the bonds of barbarians less than the violence of seducers and abominable places, lest the members dedicated to Christ, and devoted for ever in honour of continence by modest. virtue, should be sullied by the Just and contagion of the insulter.","index":"7","references":[{"fn":"59","code":"P5900_1850305","folder":"ANF-05","text":"1 Cor. iii. 16.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":3,"verses":[16]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5901_1850839","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Gal. iii. 27.","bible_refs":[{"book":"galatians","chapter":3,"verses":[27]}]}]},{"text":"3. Our brotherhood, considering all these things according to your letter, and sorrowfully examining, have all promptly and willingly and liberally gathered together supplies of money for the brethren, being always indeed, according to the strength of their faith, prone to the work of God, but now even more stimulated to salutary works by the consideration of so great a suffering. For since the Lord in His Gospel says, \"I was sick, and ye visited me,\"[fn-59-P5903_1852594:7-nf] with how much greater reward for our work will He say now, \"I was captive, and ye redeemed me!\" And since again He says, \"I was in prison, and ye came unto me,\" how much more will it be when He begins to say, \"I was in the dungeon of captivity, and I lay shut up and bound among barbarians, and from that prison of slavery you delivered me,\" being about to receive a reward from the Lord when the day of judgment shall come! Finally, we give you the warmest thanks that you have wished us to be sharers in your anxiety,[fn-59-P5904_1853132:8-nf] and in so great and necessary a work-that you have offered us fruitful fields in which we might cast the seeds of our hope, with the expectation of a harvest of the most abundant fruits which will proceed from this heavenly and saving operation. We have then sent you a sum of one hundred thousand sesterces,[fn-59-P5905_1853534:9-nf] which have been collected here in the Church over which by the Lord's mercy we preside, by the contributions of the clergy and people established with us, which you will there dispense with what diligence you may.","index":"8","references":[{"fn":"59","code":"P5903_1852594","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Matt. xxv. 36.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":25,"verses":[36]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5904_1853132","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Primitive Christians were grateful for opportunities to distribute gifts.
