The Abba of Holy Writ has its equivalent in many Oriental languages, as well as in the Greek and Latin, through which it has passed into all the dialects of Europe. It was originally given to all presbyters, as implied in their name of elders, and was a title of humility when it became peculiar to the bishops, as (1 Peter 5:3) non Domini sed patres. St. Paul (1 Corinthians 4:15) shows that \"in Christ\"-that is, under Him-we may have such \"fathers; \"and thus, while he indicates the true sense of the precept, he leads us to recognise a prophetic force and admonition in our Saviour's words (Matthew 23:1), \"Call no man your father upon the earth.\" Thus interpreted, these words seem to be a warning against the sense to which this name, Papa, became, long afterwards, restricted, in Western Europe: Notre St. Pere, le Pape, as they say in France. This was done by the decree of the ambitious Hildebrand, Gregory VII. (who died a.d. 1085), when, in a synod held at Rome, he defined that \"the title Pope should be peculiar to one only in the Christian world.\" The Easterns, of course, never paid any respect to this novelty and dictation, and to this day their patriarchs are popes; and not only so, for the parish priests of the Greek churches are called by the same name. I was once cordially invited to take a repast \"with the pope,\" on visiting a Greek church on the shores of the Adriatic. It is said, however, that a distinction is made between the words pa/paj and papa=j; the latter being peculiar to inferiors, according to the refinements of Goar, a Western critic. Valeat quantum. But I must here note, that as \"words are things,\" and as infinite damage has been done to history and to Christian truth by tolerating this empiricism of Rome, I have restored scientific accuracy, in this series, whenever reference is made to the primitive bishops of Rome, who were no more \"Popes\" than Cincinnatus was an emperor. It is time that theological science should accept, like other sciences, the language of truth and the terminology of demonstrated fact. The early bishops of Rome were geographically important, and were honoured as sitting in the only apostolic see of the West; but they were almost inconsiderable in the structural work of the ante-Nicene ages, and have left no appreciable impress on its theology. After the Council of Nice they were recognised as patriarchs, though equals among brethren, and nothing more. The ambition of Boniface III. led him to name himself \"universal bishop.\" This was at first a mere name \"of intolerable pride,\" as his predecessor Gregory had called it, but Nicholas I. (a.d. 858) tried to make it real, and, by means of the false decretals, created himself the first \"Pope\" in the modern sense, imposing his despotism on the West, and identifying it with the polity of Western churches, which alone submitted to it. Thus, it was never Catholic, and came into existence only by nullifying the Nicene Constitutions, and breaking away from Catholic communion with the parent churches of the East. Compare Casaubon (Exercit., xiv. p. 280, etc.) in his comments on Baronius. I have thus stated with scientific precision what all candid critics and historians, even the Gallicans included, enable us to prove. Why, then, keep up the language of fiction and imposture,[fn-25-P2523_827532:77-nf] so confusing to young students? I believe the youthful Oxonians whom our modern Tertullian carried with him into the papal schism, could never have been made dupes but for the persistent empiricism of orthodox writers who practically adopt in words what they refute in argument, calling all bishops of Rome \"Popes,\" and even including St. Peter's blessed name in this fallacious designation.[fn-25-P2524_828037:78-nf] In this series I adhere to the logic of facts, calling (1) all the bishops of Rome from Linus to Sylvester simply bishops; and (2) all their successors to Nicholas I. \"patriarchs\" under the Nicene Constitutions, which they professed to honour, though, after Gregory the Great, they were ever vying with Constantinople to make themselves greater. (3) Nicholas, who trampled on the Nicene Constitutions, and made the false decretals the canon law of the Western churches, was therefore the first \"Pope\" who answers to the Tridentine definitions. Even these, however, were never able to make dogmatic[fn-25-P2525_829106:79-nf] the claim of \"supremacy,\" which was first done by Pins IX. in our days. A canonical Primacy is one thing: a self-asserted Supremacy is quite another, as the French doctors have abundantly demonstrated.","index":"29","references":[{"fn":"25","code":"P2523_827532","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Pompey and others were called imperatoresbefore the Caesars, but who includes them with the Roman emperors?","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"25","code":"P2524_828037","folder":"ANF-05","text":"How St. Peter would regard it, see 1 Pet. v. 1-3.

But let us come to facts. Bunsen's preliminary remarks[fn-25-P2533_830471:82-nf] are excellent. But when he comes to note an \"exceptional system\" in the Roman \"presbytery,\" he certainly confuses all things. Let us recur to Tertullian.[fn-25-P2534_830638:83-nf] See how much was already established in his day, which the Council of Nicaea recognised a century later as (ta\\ a0rxai=a e !qh) old primitive institutions. In all things the Greek churches were the exemplar and the model for other churches to follow. \"Throughout the provinces of Greece,\" he says, \"there are held, in definite localities, those councils,\" etc. \"If we also, in our diverse provinces, observe,\" etc. Now, these councils, or \"meetings,\" in spite of the emperors or the senate who issued mandates against them, as appears from the same passage, were, in the Roman Province, made up of the comprovincial bishops: and their gatherings seem to have been called \"the Roman presbytery; \"for, as is evident, the bishops and elders were alike called \"presbyters,\" the word being as common to both orders as the word pastors or clergymen in our days. According to the thirty-fourth of the \"Canons Apostolical,\" as Bunsen remarks, \"the bishops of the suburban towns, including Portus, also formed at that time an integral part of the Roman presbytery.\" This word also refers to all the presbyters of the diocese of Rome itself; and I doubt not originally the laity had their place, as they did in Carthage: \"the apostles, elders, and brethren\" being the formula of Scripture; or, \"with the whole Church,\" which includes them,-omni plebe adstante.[fn-25-P2535_832040:84-nf] Now, all this accounts, as Bunsen justly observes, for the fact that one of the \"presbytery\" should be thus repeatedly called presbyter and \"at the same time have the charge of the church at Portus, for which (office) there was no other title than the old one of bishop; for such was the title of every man who presided over the congregation in any city,-at Ostia, at Tusculum, or in the other suburban cities.","index":"33","references":[{"fn":"25","code":"P2531_830152","folder":"ANF-05","text":"See his Hippol., vol. i. pp. 209, 311.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"25","code":"P2532_830299","folder":"ANF-05","text":"See vol. ii. p. 298, this series.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"25","code":"P2533_830471","folder":"ANF-05","text":"p. 207.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"25","code":"P2534_830638","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Vol. iv p 114, Elucidation II., this series.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"25","code":"P2535_832040","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Even Quinet notes this.

The question may well arise, in our Christian love for antiquity, How could such things be, even in the age of martyrdoms? Let us recollect, that under the good Bishop Pius, when his brother wrote the Hermas, the peril of wealth and love of money began to be imminent at Rome. Tertullian testifies to the lax discipline of that see when he was there. Minucius Felix lets us into the impressions made by the Roman Christians upon surrounding heathen: they were a set of conies burrowing in the earth; a \"light-shunning people,\" lurking in the catacombs. And yet, while this fact shows plainly that good men were not ambitious to come forth from these places of exile and suffering, and expose themselves needlessly to death, it leads us to comprehend how ambitious men, studiosi novarum rerum, could remain above ground, conforming very little to the discipline of Christ, making friends with the world, and yet using their nominal religion on the principle that \"gain is godliness.\" There were some wealthy Christians; there were others, like Marcia in the palace, sufficiently awakened to perceive their own wickedness, and anxious to do favours to the persecuted flock, by way, perhaps, of compounding for sins not renounced. And when we come to the Epistles of Cyprian,[fn-25-P2567_840966:92-nf] we shall see what opportunities were given to desperate men to make themselves a sort of brokers to the Christian community; for selfish ends helping them in times of peril, and rendering themselves, to the less conscientious, a medium for keeping on good terms with the magistrates.

The word retained is questionable in the first instance; and I have adopted Wordsworth's reading, to be enrolled, which is doubtless the sense.","index":"68","references":[]},{"text":"This statement of our author lends apparent countenance to the antiquity of the \"Apostolic Constitutions,\" so called. Perhaps Hippolytus really supposed them to be apostolic. By Canon XVII. of that collection, a man twice married, after baptism cannot be \"on the sacerdotal list at all.\" By Canon XXVI., an unmarried person once admitted to the clergy cannot be permitted to marry. These are the two cases referred to by our author. In the Greek churches this rule holds to this day; and the Council of Nice refused to prohibit the married clergy to live in that holy estate, while allowing the traditional discipline which Hippolytus had in view in speaking of a violation of the twenty-sixth traditional canon as a sin. As Bingham has remarked, however, canons of discipline may be relaxed when not resting on fundamental and scriptural laws.","index":"69","references":[]},{"text":"\nXIV","index":"70","references":[]},{"text":"Attempt to call themselves a Catholic Church, p. 131","index":"71","references":[]},{"text":"The Callistians, it seems, became a heretical sect, and yet presumed to call themselves a \"Catholic Church.\" Yet this sect, while Callistus lived, was in full communion with the Bishop of Rome.

Let us not be surprised, that, during these conflicts, truth on such mysterious subjects was reflected from good men's minds with slight variations of expression. Rather behold the miracle of their essential agreement, and of their entire harmony in the Great Symbol, universally accepted as the testimony of the ante-Nicene witnesses.

Let it be noted, that, while one must be surprised by the ready command of literary and theological materials which the learned doctor and chevalier brings into instantaneous use for his work, it is hardly less surprising, in spite of all that, that he was willing to throw off his theories and strictures, without any delay, during the confusions of that memorable year 1851, when I had the honour of meeting him among London notabilities. He says to his \"dearest friend, Archdeacon Hare, ... Dr. Tregelles informed me last week of the appearance of the work (of Hippolytus) ... I procured a copy in consequence, and perused it as soon as I could; and I have already arrived at conclusions which seem to me so evident that I feel no hesitation in expressing them to you at once.\" These conclusions were creditable to his acumen and learning in general; eminently so.
