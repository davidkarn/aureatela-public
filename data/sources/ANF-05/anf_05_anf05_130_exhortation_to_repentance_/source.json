But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and of clay; and some indeed for honour, and some for contempt. Therefore if any one shall amend[fn-98-P9896_3085798:55-nf] himself from these things, he shall be a vessel sanctified for honour, and useful for the Lord, prepared for every good work. Moreover, flee youthful lusts: but follow after righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call upon the Lord from a pure heart. But avoid questions that are foolish and without learning, knowing that they beget strifes. And the servant of the Lord ought not to strive; but to be gentle, docile to all men, patient with modesty, correcting those who resist, lest at any time God may give them repentance to the acknowledgment of the truth, and recover themselves from the snares of the devil, by whom they are held captive at his will.\"[fn-98-P9897_3086577:56-nf] ","index":"46","references":[{"fn":"98","code":"P9896_3085798","folder":"ANF-05","text":"\"Emendaverit,\" probably a mistake for \"emuadaverit,\" \"shall purge,\" as in the Vulg.; scil. ekkaqarh.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"98","code":"P9897_3086577","folder":"ANF-05","text":"On true penitence see Epistle xxv. p. 304 supra.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"Also in the Apocalypse: \"Remember whence thou hast fallen, and repent; but if not, I will come to thee quickly, and remove thy candlestick out of its place.\"[fn-98-P9899_3086806:57-nf] ","index":"47","references":[{"fn":"98","code":"P9899_3086806","folder":"ANF-05","text":"This selection of texts seems made on the same principle which dictated the compilation of texts against the Jews: a  breviarium, the author calls it,- qusedam utilia collecta et digesta,-to be read with readiness, and frequently referred to.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"","index":"48","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"49","references":[]}]}]}
