Cyprian, who then ruled the Church of Carthage, was the first who judged that they must not be admitted to communion unless they were first purified from error by baptism. But Stephen, thinking that nothing should be innovated contrary to the tradition which had already obtained in that matter from the beginning, was indignant at this. And as Dionysius had already written many letters to him on this argument, he intimates to him finally, that all the churches everywhere, now that the fury of persecution was abated, detesting the turbulent novelty of Novatian,[fn-108-P10809_3435021:63-nf] had established peace with one another.\" parparpar","index":"4","references":[{"fn":"108","code":"P10809_3435021","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Eusebius calls him Novatus.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"","index":"5","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"6","references":[]}]}]}
