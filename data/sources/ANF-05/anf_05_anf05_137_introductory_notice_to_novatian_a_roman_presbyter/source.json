We deplore the lapse of such characters, but after death they are not subject to human judgment. Let us cherish the gratitude we owe to them for their good works, and use their testimony so far as it was faithful; covering their shame with the mantle of charity, and praying for grace never to imitate their faults. \"If any teacher have wandered from the faith, it is permitted,\" says St. Vincent of[fn-100-P10052_3116333:1-nf] , \"by Divine Providence for our trial, whether we love God or not, with all our heart and with all our soul.\"","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"100","code":"P10052_3116333","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In his Commontory, cap. xix. p. 57, ed.

This was about a.d. 250, after the death of Fabian. His marked abilities and real services had fitted him to preside thus over the Roman presbytery, and to be their \"secretary for foreign affairs.\" But he laboured under the impediment of clinic baptism, and had not an unblemished record, if we credit Eusebius,[fn-100-P10054_3117108:2-nf] in his conduct during persecution.","index":"4","references":[{"fn":"100","code":"P10054_3117108","folder":"ANF-05","text":"H E., vi.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"He was not called, therefore, to the episcopate. Cornelius was made bishop June 4, a.d. 251; and, apparently, disappointed ambition soon bore its thorny fruits. \"Emulation of the episcopal office is the mother of schisms,\" said Tertullian;[fn-100-P10056_3117395:3-nf] even in that period when to be a bishop was so often to be a martyr. And we find Novatian grasping a shadowy titular bishopric, which, wholly irregular and universally disowned, could have been to such a man the source of nothing but misery. I say, \"to such a man,\" for, without hearing the other side, I cannot accept what was unquestionably supposed to be fact amid the excitements of the times. And Novatian was not a common or a vulgar character. The arguments of Lardner[fn-100-P10057_3117913:4-nf] teach us at least to be Christians,-to accept the facts, but \"forbear to judge,\" seeing, as that writer observes, \"we have not one remaining line of his in self-defence or against his adversaries.\"","index":"5","references":[{"fn":"100","code":"P10056_3117395","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Vol. iii. cap 17, p. 677, this series.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"100","code":"P10057_3117913","folder":"ANF-05","text":"His elaborate chapter (xlvii. and the note) must be read by all students who wish to understand the matter, or even to read Cyprian advantageously.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"Now as to his orthodoxy, so far as his extant writings are concerned, I think any scholar, not anxious to make out a case, will abide by the candid judgment of Bull, who defends his reputation against Petavius.[fn-100-P10059_3118472:5-nf] \"By no means,\" he says, \"should we tolerate that injustice of the Jesuit Petau towards the ancient writers, against their manifest mind and purpose; twisting, as he everywhere does, their sound and Catholic sayings into a sense alien and heretical.\"","index":"6","references":[{"fn":"100","code":"P10059_3118472","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Defensio Fid.

His heresy, such as it was, turned upon unrelenting discipline, and was a sin against charity, which is greater than faith itself. It violated the \"seventy times seven\" maxim of our Lord, and the comprehensive precept, \"Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven.\" It wounded Christian unity at a perilous period, and when every breach in the wall of the fold was sure to let in the wolves.","index":"7","references":[]},{"text":"\"He may have aspired to the papal chair,\" says a contemporary writer[fn-100-P10062_3119454:6-nf] of no mean repute, adding, \"to which he had the best claim.\" Then he says, \"Novatian was elected anti-pope by a minority, and consecrated by three Italian bishops.\" Is this history? What impression must it give to the young student? The learned writer whom I quote shows clearly enough that there was no \"papacy\" in primitive times, as that word is universally understood. Why, then, put a face upon Antiquity so utterly misleading? Neither Novatian, nor his consecrators, nor Cornelius, against whom he rebelled, ever dreamed of anything more than of an episcopal chair; venerable, indeed, for its succession of pastors from the times of SS. Peter and Paul, but as yet hardly felt in the Christian brotherhood; which for two centuries had produced many pious but few eminent men, and in which Novatian himself was the earliest contributor to the \"Latin Christianity,\" already founded and flourishing, not in Italy, but in Northern Africa.","index":"8","references":[{"fn":"100","code":"P10062_3119454","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Dr. Schaff;  History of Christian Church, vol. ii. p. 851.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"The following is the Introductory Notice of the Edinburgh translator, the Rev.

For a long time he was in determined opposition to Cornelius, bishop of Rome, in regard to the admission of the lapsed and penitent into the Church; but the facts of the controversy and much of our information in regard to Novatian are to be got only from his enemies, the Roman bishop and his adherents.

It is also stated by Cyprian, that he was a Stoic before he passed over to the Christian Church; but this also has been doubted. While amongst the catechumens, he was seized by a violent disease, attributed to demoniac agency; and, being near death, he received baptism. He was ordained presbyter by Fabian, bishop of Rome, against the wishes of the rest of the clergy, who objected thereto because he had received clinic baptism.[fn-100-P10069_3122227:10-nf] The subsequent circumstances of his schism and his contest with Cornelius, are stated at length with no friendly spirit in a letter to Antonianus by Cyprian.[fn-100-P10070_3122419:11-nf] Socrates[fn-100-P10071_3122825:12-nf] states that he suffered martyrdom; but his authority, amid the silence of all others, is not sufficient to guarantee the fact.","index":"11","references":[{"fn":"100","code":"P10068_3121498","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Hist.
