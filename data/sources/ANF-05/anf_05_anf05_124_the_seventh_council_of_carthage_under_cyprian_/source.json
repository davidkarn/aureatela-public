Moreover, another letter of Jubaianus has also been read to you, wherein, replying, in accordance with his sincere and religious devotion, to my letter, he not only acquiesced in what I had said, but, confessing that he had been instructed thereby, he returned thanks for it. It remains, that upon this same matter each of us should bring forward what we think, judging no man, nor rejecting any one from the right of communion, if he should think differently from us. For neither does any of us set himself up as a bishop of bishops,[fn-94-P9410_2935700:3-nf] nor by tyrannical terror does any compel his colleague to the necessity of obedience; since every bishop, according to the allowance of his liberty and power, has his own proper right of judgment, and can no more be judged by another than he himself can judge another.[fn-94-P9411_2936136:4-nf] But let us all wait for the judgment of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the only one that has the power both of preferring us in the government of His Church, and of judging us in our conduct there.","index":"7","references":[{"fn":"94","code":"P9410_2935700","folder":"ANF-05","text":"\"their brother,\" and forcibly contrasts the spirit of Cyprian with that of his intolerant compeer","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"94","code":"P9411_2936136","folder":"ANF-05","text":"This, then is the primitive idea of the relations existing, mutually, among bishops as brethren.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"Caecilius of Bilta[fn-94-P9413_2936453:5-nf] said: I know only one baptism in the Church, and none out of the Church.

Certain people therefore interpret for themselves ill, when they say that by imposition of the hand they receive the Holy Ghost, and are thus received, when it is manifest that they ought to be born again in the Catholic Church by both sacraments. Then indeed they will be able to be sons of God, as says the apostle: \"Taking care to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body, and one Spirit, as ye have been called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God.\"[fn-94-P9429_2941140:17-nf] All these things speaks the Catholic Church.[fn-94-P9430_2941204:18-nf] And again, in the Gospel the Lord says: \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit; because God is a Spirit, and he is born of God.\"[fn-94-P9431_2941452:19-nf] Therefore, whatsoever things all heretics and schismatics do are carnal, as the apostle says: \"For the works of the flesh are manifest, which are, fornications, uncleannesses, incest, idolatries, witchcrafts, hatreds, contentions, jealousy, anger, divisions, heresies, and the like to these; concerning which have told you before, as I also foretell you now, that whoever do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-94-P9432_2941896:20-nf] And thus the apostle condemns, with all the wicked, those also who cause division, that is, schismatics and heretics. Unless therefore they receive saving baptism in the Catholic Church, which is one, they cannot be saved, but will be condemned with the carnal in the judgment of the Lord Christ.","index":"12","references":[{"fn":"94","code":"P9425_2939439","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In Mauritania Caesariensis.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"94","code":"P9426_2940068","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Prov. ix. 12, LXX.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","chapter":9,"verses":[12]}]},{"fn":"94","code":"P9427_2940261","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Prov. ix. 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","chapter":9,"verses":[19]}]},{"fn":"94","code":"P9428_2940447","folder":"ANF-05","text":"John iii. 5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":3,"verses":[5]}]},{"fn":"94","code":"P9429_2941140","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Eph. iv. 3-6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"ephesians","chapter":4,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"94","code":"P9430_2941204","folder":"ANF-05","text":"He has no idea that this voice proceeds from any one bishop.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"94","code":"P9431_2941452","folder":"ANF-05","text":"John iii. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":3,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"94","code":"P9432_2941896","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Gal. v. 19-21.","bible_refs":[{"book":"galatians","chapter":5,"verses":[19]}]}]},{"text":"Januarius of Lambesis[fn-94-P9434_2942234:21-nf] said: According to the authority[fn-94-P9435_2942284:22-nf] of the Holy Scriptures, I decree that all heretics must be baptized, and so admitted into the holy Church.","index":"13","references":[{"fn":"94","code":"P9434_2942234","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In Numidia.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"94","code":"P9435_2942284","folder":"ANF-05","text":"This appeal to Scripture against Stephen must be noted, whatever we may think of his conclusions.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"Lucius of Castra Galbae[fn-94-P9437_2942519:23-nf] said: Since the Lord in His Gospel said, \"Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt should have lost its savour, wherewith shall it be salted?
