This much may be collected from the fact that he names one, and only one, persecution after that of Decius-namely, that of Gallus and Volusianus-and speaks of those who had lapsed under the former, as having been stedfast and victorious in the latter.[fn-105-P10590_3335412:2-nf] He is generally believed to have been an Africa, and Tillemont is only withheld from attributing the work to Cyprian himself by what he judges to be a difference of style. But although from the exordium it may be concluded that the writer was a bishop, yet, from his manifest uncertainty as to the fitting way to treat those who had lapsed, it is evident that Cyprian cannot have been the author; for that prelate, when the persecution of Gallus and Volusianus was just threatening, had already decided upon receiving to communion the penitents who had yielded to temptation under Decius.[fn-105-P10591_3336035:3-nf] ","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"105","code":"P10590_3335412","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Epistles, liii. p. 336, supra.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"105","code":"P10591_3336035","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Ch.
