Many and great, beloved brethren, are the divine benefits wherewith the large and abundant mercy of God the Father and Christ both has laboured and is always labouring for our salvation: that the Father sent the Son to preserve us and give us life, in order that He might restore us; and that the Son was willing[fn-74-P7480_2489427:2-nf] to be sent and to become the Son of man, that He might make us sons of God; humbled Himself, that He might raise up the people who before were prostrate; was wounded that He might heal our wounds; served, that He might draw out to liberty those who were in bondage; underwent death, that He might set forth immortality to mortals. These are many and great boons of divine compassion. But, moreover, what is that providence, and how great the clemency, that by a plan of salvation it is provided for us, that more abundant care should be taken for preserving man after he is already redeemed! For when the Lord at His advent had cured those wounds which Adam had borne,[fn-74-P7481_2490265:3-nf] and had healed the old poisons of the serpent,[fn-74-P7482_2490357:4-nf] He gave a law to the sound man and bade him sin no more, lest a worse thing should befall the sinner. We had been limited and shut up into a narrow space by the commandment of innocence. Nor would the infirmity and weakness of human frailty have any resource, unless the divine mercy, coming once more in aid, should open some way of securing salvation by pointing out works of justice and mercy, so that by almsgiving we may wash away whatever foulness we subsequently contract.[fn-74-P7483_2490870:5-nf] ","index":"4","references":[{"fn":"74","code":"P7480_2489427","folder":"ANF-05","text":"A slight and scarcely noticeable difference occurs here in the Oxford text, which reads the passage, \"that the Son was sent, and willed to be called the Son of man.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"74","code":"P7481_2490265","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Portaverat; \"had brought\" (Oxf. transl.).","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"74","code":"P7482_2490357","folder":"ANF-05","text":"\"Poisons of the old serpent.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"74","code":"P7483_2490870","folder":"ANF-05","text":"The beauty of Cyprian's exordiums and perorations proves that he was a true orator. \"Great and manifold,\" etc., Translators of King James.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"2. The Holy Spirit speaks in the sacred Scriptures, and says, \"By almsgiving and faith sins are purged.\"[fn-74-P7485_2491119:6-nf] Not assuredly those sins which had been previously contracted, for those are purged by the blood and sanctification of Christ. Moreover, He says again, \"As water extinguisheth fire, so almsgiving quencheth sin.\"[fn-74-P7486_2491393:7-nf] Here also it is shown and proved, that as in the layer of saving water the fire of Gehenna is extinguished, so by almsgiving and works of righteousness the flame of sins is subdued. And because in baptism remission of sins is granted once for all, constant and ceaseless labour, following the likeness of baptism, once again bestows the mercy of God. The Lord teaches this also in the Gospel. For when the disciples were pointed out, as eating and not first washing their hands, He replied and said, \"He that made that which is within, made also that which is without. But give alms, and behold all things are clean unto you; \"[fn-74-P7487_2492041:8-nf] teaching hereby and showing, that not the hands are to be washed, but the heart, and that the foulness from inside is to be done away rather than that from outside; but that he who shall have cleansed what is within has cleansed also that which is without; and that if the mind is cleansed, a man has begun to be clean also in skin and body. Further, admonishing, and showing whence we may be clean and purged, He added that alms must be given. He who is pitiful teaches and warns us that pity must be shown; and because He seeks to save those whom at a great cost He has redeemed, He teaches that those who, after the grace of baptism, have become foul, may once more be cleansed.","index":"5","references":[{"fn":"74","code":"P7485_2491119","folder":"ANF-05","text":"\" By mercy and truth,\" etc., Eng.

Let us then acknowledge, beloved brethren, the wholesome gift of the divine mercy; and let us, who cannot be without some wound of conscience, heal our wounds by the spiritual remedies for the cleansing and purging of our sins.

Finally, beloved brethren, the divine admonition in the Scriptures, as well old as new, has never failed, has never been silent in urging God's people always and everywhere to works of mercy; and in the strain and exhortation of the Holy Spirit, every one who is instructed into the hope of the heavenly kingdom is commanded to give alms. God commands and prescribes to Isaiah: \"Cry,\" says He, \"with strength, and spare not. Lift up thy voice as a trumpet, and declare to my people their transgressions, and to the house of Jacob their sins.\"[fn-74-P7492_2494571:11-nf] And when He had commanded their sins to be charged upon them, and with the full force of His indignation had set forth their iniquities, and had said, that not even though they should use supplications, and prayers, and fastings, should they be able to make atonement for their sins; nor, if they were clothed in sackcloth and ashes, be able to soften God's anger, yet in the last part showing that God can be appeased by almsgiving alone, he added, saying, \"Break thy bread to the hungry, and bring the poor that are without a home into thy house. If thou seest the naked, clothe him; and despise not the household of thine own seed. Then shall thy light break forth in season, and thy garments shall arise speedily; and righteousness shall go before thee, and the glory of God shall surround thee.

The remedies for propitiating God are given in the words of God Himself; the divine instructions have taught what sinners ought to do, that by works of righteousness God is satisfied, that with the deserts of mercy sins are cleansed. And in Solomon we read, \"Shut up alms in the heart of the poor, and these shall intercede for thee from all evil.\"[fn-74-P7495_2495867:13-nf] And again: \"Whoso stoppeth his ears that he may not hear the weak, he also shall call upon God, and there will be none to hear him.\"[fn-74-P7496_2496023:14-nf] For he shall not be able to deserve the mercy of the Lord, who himself shall not have been merciful; nor shall he obtain aught from the divine pity in his prayers, who shall not have been humane towards the poor man's prayer. And this also the Holy Spirit declares in the Psalms, and proves, saying, Blessed is he that considereth of the poor and needy; the Lord will deliver him in the evil day.\"[fn-74-P7497_2496441:15-nf] Remembering which precepts, Daniel, when king Nebuchodonosor was in anxiety, being frightened by an adverse dream, gave him, for the turning away of evils, a remedy to obtain the divine help, saying, \"Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to thee; and redeem thy sins by almsgivings, and thine unrighteousness by mercies to the poor, and God will be patient[fn-74-P7498_2496826:16-nf] to thy sins.\"[fn-74-P7499_2496938:17-nf] And as the king did not obey him, he underwent the misfortunes and mischiefs which he had seen, and which he might have escaped and avoided had he redeemed his sins by almsgiving. Raphael the angel also witnesses the like, and exhorts that alms should be freely and liberally bestowed, saying, \"Prayer is good, with fasting and alms; because alms doth deliver from death, and it purgeth away sins.\"[fn-75-P7500_2497355:18-nf] He shows that our prayers and fastings are of less avail, unless they are aided by almsgiving; that entreaties alone are of little force to obtain what they seek, unless they be made sufficient[fn-75-P7501_2497570:19-nf] by the addition of deeds and good works.

Neither, beloved brethren, are we so bringing forward these things, as that we should not prove what Raphael the angel said, by the testimony of the truth. In the Acts of the Apostles the faith of the fact is established; and that souls are delivered by almsgiving not only from the second, but from the first death, is discovered by the evidence of a matter accomplished and completed. When Tabitha, being greatly given to good works and to bestowing alms, fell sick and died, Peter was summoned to her lifeless body; and when he, with apostolic humanity, had come in haste, there stood around him widows weeping and entreating, showing the cloaks, and coats, and all the garments which they had previously received, and praying for the deceased not by their words, but by her own deeds. Peter felt that what was asked in such a way might be obtained, and that Christ's aid would not be wanting to the petitioners, since He Himself was clothed in the clothing of the widows. When, therefore, falling on his knees, he had prayed, and-fit advocate for the widows and poor-had brought to the Lord the prayers entrusted to him, turning to the body, which was now lying washed on the bier,[fn-75-P7503_2499112:20-nf] he said, \"Tabitha, in the name of Jesus Christ, arise!\"[fn-75-P7504_2499221:21-nf] Nor did He fail to bring aid to Peter, who had said in the Gospel, that whatever should be asked in His name should be given. Therefore death is suspended, and the spirit is restored, and, to the marvel and astonishment of all, the revived body is quickened into this worldly light once more; so effectual were the merits of mercy, so much did righteous works avail! She who had conferred upon suffering widows the help needful to live, deserved to be recalled to life by the widows' petition.","index":"9","references":[{"fn":"75","code":"P7503_2499112","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Other translators read, \"in the upper chamber.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"75","code":"P7504_2499221","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Acts ix. 40.","bible_refs":[{"book":"the acts","chapter":9,"verses":[40]}]}]},{"text":"7. Therefore in the Gospel, the Lord, the Teacher of our life and Master of eternal salvation, quickening the assembly of believers, and providing for them for ever when quickened, among His divine commands and precepts of heaven, commands and prescribes nothing more frequently than that we should devote ourselves to almsgiving, and not depend on earthly possessions, but rather lay up heavenly treasures. \"Sell,\" says He, \"your goods, and give alms.\"[fn-75-P7506_2500187:22-nf] And again: \"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust do corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal.

He says: \"The kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchantman seeking goodly pearls.

In fine, He calls those the children of Abraham whom He sees to be laborious in aiding and nourishing the poor. For when Zacchaeus said, \"Behold, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have done any wrong to any man, I restore fourfold,\" Jesus answered and said, \"That salvation has this day come to this house, for that he also is a son of Abraham.\"[fn-75-P7512_2501771:27-nf] For if Abraham believed in God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness, certainly he who gives alms according to God's precept believes in God, and he who has the truth of faith maintains the fear of God; moreover, he who maintains the fear of God considers God in showing mercy to the poor. For he labours thus because he believes-because he knows that what is foretold by God's word is true, and that the Holy Scripture cannot lie-that unfruitful trees, that is, unproductive men, are cut off and cast into the fire, but that the merciful are called into the kingdom. He also, in another place, calls laborious and fruitful men faithful; but He denies faith to unfruitful and barren ones, saying, \"If ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to you that which is true?

If you dread and fear, lest, if you begin to act thus abundantly, your patrimony being exhausted with your liberal dealing, you may perchance be reduced to poverty; be of good courage in this respect, be free from care: that cannot be exhausted whence the service of Christ is supplied, whence the heavenly work is celebrated. Neither do I vouch for this on my own authority; but I promise it on the faith of the Holy Scriptures, and on the authority of the divine promise. The Holy Spirit speaks by Solomon, and says, \"He that giveth unto the poor shall never lack, but he that turneth away his eye shall be in great poverty; \"[fn-75-P7515_2503363:29-nf] showing that the merciful and those who do good works cannot want, but rather that the sparing and barren hereafter come to want. Moreover, the blessed Apostle Paul, full of the grace of the Lord's inspiration, says: \"He that ministereth seed to the sower, shall both minister bread for your food, and shall multiply your seed sown, and shall increase the growth of the fruits of your righteousness, that in all things ye may be enriched.\"[fn-75-P7516_2503825:30-nf] And again: \"The administration of this service shall not only supply the wants of the saints, but shall be abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God; \"[fn-75-P7517_2504000:31-nf] because, while thanks are directed to God for our almsgivings and labours, by the prayer of the poor, the wealth of the doer is increased by the retribution of God. And the Lord in the Gospel, already considering the hearts of men of this kind, and with prescient voice denouncing faithless and unbelieving men, bears witness, and says: \"Take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? For these things the Gentiles seek. And your Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. Seek first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.\"[fn-75-P7518_2504664:32-nf] He says that all these things shall be added and given to them who seek the kingdom and righteousness of God.
