I had believed, brother, that you were now at length turned to repentance for having either rashly heard or believed in time past things so wicked, so disgraceful, so execrable even among Gentiles, concerning me. But even now in your letter I perceive that you are still the same as you were before-that you believe the same things concerning me, and that you persist in what you did believe, and, lest by chance the dignity of your eminence and your martyrdom should be stained by communion with me, that you are inquiring carefully into my character; and after God the Judge who makes priests, that you wish to judge-I will not say of me, for what am I?-but of the judgment of God and of Christ. This is not to believe in God-this is to stand forth as a rebel against Christ and His Gospel; so that although He says, \"Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and neither of them falls to the ground without the will of my Father,\"[fn-61-P6161_1946692:3-nf] and His majesty and truth prove that even things of little consequence are not done without the consciousness and permission of God, you think that God's priests are ordained in the Church without His knowledge.

But with you the fabrication of hostile and malignant men has prevailed against the divine decree, and against our conscience resting upon the strength of its faith, as if among lapsed and profane persons placed outside the Church, from whose breasts the Holy Spirit has departed, there could be anything else than a depraved mind and a deceitful tongue, and venomous hatred, and sacrilegious lies, which whosoever believes, must of necessity be found with them when the day of judgment shall come.","index":"7","references":[{"fn":"61","code":"P6163_1947665","folder":"ANF-05","text":"John v. 31, 32.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":5,"verses":[31]}]}]},{"text":"3.
