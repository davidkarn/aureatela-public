Having, then, previously marked it out for investigation, they draw the birth of persons falling under consideration from, unquestionably, the depositing of the seed, and (from) conception or from parturition. And if one will attempt to take (the horoscope) from conception, the accurate account of this is incomprehensible, the time (occupied) passing quickly, and naturally (so). For we are not able to say whether conception takes place upon the transference[fn-5-P545_119413:13-nf] of the seed or not. For this can happen even as quick as thought, just also as leaven, when put into heated jars, immediately is reduced to a glutinous state. But conception can also (take place) after a lapse of duration. For there being an interval from the mouth of the womb to the fundament, where physicians[fn-5-P546_119772:14-nf] say conceptions take place, it is altogether the nature of the seed deposited to occupy some time in traversing[fn-5-P547_119921:15-nf] this interval. The Chaldeans, therefore, being ignorant of the quantity of duration to a nicety, never will comprehend the (moment of) conception; the seed at one time being injected straight forward, and falling at one spot upon actual parts of the womb well disposed for conception, and at another time dropping into it dispersedly, and being collected into one place by uterine energies. Now, while these matters are unknown, (namely), as to when the first takes place, and when the second, and how much time is spent in that particular conception, and how much in this; while, I say, ignorance on these points prevails on the part of these (astrologers), an accurate comprehension of conception is put out of the question.[fn-5-P548_120665:16-nf] And if, as some natural philosophers have asserted, the seed, remaining stationary first, and undergoing alteration in the womb, then enters the (womb's) opened blood-vessels, as the seeds of the earth[fn-5-P549_120888:17-nf] sink into the ground; from this it will follow, that those who are not acquainted with the quantity of time occupied by the change, will not be aware of the precise moment of conception either. And, moreover, as women[fn-5-P550_121136:18-nf] differ from one another in the other parts of the body, both as regards energy and in other respects, so also (it is reasonable to suppose that they differ from one another) in respect of energy of womb, some conceiving quicker, and others slower. And this is not strange, since also women, when themselves compared with themselves, at times are observed having a strong disposition towards conception, but at times with no such tendency. And when this is so, it is impossible to say with accuracy when the deposited seed coalesces, in order that from this time the Chaldeans may fix the horoscope of the birth.","index":"59","references":[{"fn":"5","code":"P544_118881","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Sextus uses almost these words.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"5","code":"P545_119413","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Or \"lodgment\" (Sextus), or \"deposition.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"5","code":"P546_119772","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Or, \"attendants of physicians.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"5","code":"P547_119921","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Or, \"make.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"5","code":"P548_120665","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Or, \"vanishes.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"5","code":"P549_120888","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Not in Sextus Empiricus.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"5","code":"P550_121136","folder":"ANF-05","text":"The passage is more clearly given in Sextus.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter IV.-Impossibility of Fixing the Horoscope; Failure of an Attempt to Do This at the Period of Birth.","index":5,"paragraphs":[{"text":"For this reason it is impossible to fix the horoscope from the (period of) conception.

But that neither is their horoscope infallible, it is easy to conclude. For when they allege that the person sitting beside the woman in travail at the time of parturition gives, by striking a metallic rim, a sign to the Chaldean, who from an elevated place is contemplating the stars, and he, looking towards heaven, marks down the rising zodiacal sign; in the first place, we shall prove to them, that when parturition happens indefinitely, as we have shown a little before, neither is it easy[fn-5-P558_123730:22-nf] to signify this (birth) by striking the metallic rim. However, grant that the birth is comprehensible, yet neither is it possible to signify this at the exact time; for as the noise of the metallic plate is capable of being divided by a longer time and one protracted, in reference to perception, it happens that the sound is carried to the height (with proportionate delay). And the following proof may be observed in the case of those felling timber at a distance. For a sufficiently long time after the descent of the axe, the sound of the stroke is heard, so that it takes a longer time to reach the listener. And for this reason, therefore, it is not possible for the Chaldeans accurately to take the time of the rising zodiacal sign, and consequently the time when one can make the horoscope with truth. And not only does more time seem to elapse after parturition, when he who is sitting beside the woman in labour strikes the metallic plate, and next after the sound reaches the listener, that is, the person who has gone up to the elevated position; but also, while he is glancing around and looking to ascertain in which of the zodiacal signs is the moon, and in which appears each of the rest of the stars, it necessarily follows that there is a different position in regard of the stars, the motion[fn-5-P559_125064:23-nf] of the pole whiffing them on with incalculable velocity, before what is seen in the heavens[fn-5-P560_125214:24-nf] is carefully adjusted to the moment when the person is born.","index":"62","references":[{"fn":"5","code":"P557_123139","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Or, \"manifestation.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"5","code":"P558_123730","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Or, \"reasonable.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"5","code":"P559_125064","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Or, \"but the motion... is whirled on with velocity.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"5","code":"P560_125214","folder":"ANF-05","text":"This rendering of the passage may be deduced from Sextus Empiricus.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter V.-Another Method of Fixing the Horoscope at Birth; Equally Futile; Use of the Clepsydra in Astrology; The Predictions of the Chaldeans Not Verified.","index":6,"paragraphs":[{"text":"In this way, the art practised by the Chaldeans will be shown to be unstable.

For he affirms that the mastery was communicated to the orbital motion of the same (circle), not only since it embraces the motion of the other, that, is, the erratic stars, but because also it possesses so great mastery, that is, so great power, that even it leads round, along with itself, by a peculiar strength of its own, those heavenly bodies-that is, the erratic stars-that are whirled along in contrary directions from west to east, and, in like manner, from east to west.","index":"75","references":[{"fn":"5","code":"P592_136469","folder":"ANF-05","text":"As regards astological predictions, see Origen's Comment. on Gen.; Diodorus of Tarsus, De Fato; Photii Biblioth., cod, ccxxiii.; and Bardesanis, De Legibus Nationum, in Cureton's Spicilegium Syriacum.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"5","code":"P593_136877","folder":"ANF-05","text":"See Plato's Timaeus.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"And he asserts that this motion was allowed to be one and indivisible, in the first place, inasmuch as the revolutions of all the fixed stars were accomplished in equal periods of time, and were not distinguished according to greater or less portions of duration.

But the kindred number is 4 and 8. These, however, taking from the monad of the numbers[fn-8-P831_209469:139-nf] an idea of virtue, progressed up to the four elements; (I allude), of course, to spirit, and fire, and water, and earth. And out of these having made the world, (God) framed it an ermaphrodite, and allocated two elements for the upper hemisphere, namely spirit and fire; and this is styled the hemisphere of the monad, (a hemisphere) beneficent, and ascending, and masculine. For, being composed of small particles, the monad soars into the most rarified and purest part of the atmosphere; and the other two elements, earth and water, being more gross, he assigned to the duad; and this is termed the descending hemisphere, both feminine and mischievous. And likewise, again, the upper elements themselves, when compared one with another, comprise in one another both male and female for fruitfulness and increase of the whole creation.

And light has been appropriated to the monad, and darkness to the duad, and life to light, according to nature, and death to the duad. And to life (has been appropriated) justice; and to death, injustice. Wherefore everything generated among masculine numbers is beneficent, while that (produced) among feminine (numbers) is mischievous. For instance, they pursue their calculations thus: monad-that we may commence from this-becomes 361, which (numbers) terminate in a monad by the subtraction of the ennead.

For the first creation, he affirms, is that according to Adam in labours, this is he who is seen \"on his knees\" (Engonasis). The second creation, however, is that according to Christ, by which we are regenerated; and this is Anguitenens, who struggles against the Beast, and hinders him from reaching Corona, which is reserved for the man. But \"The Great Bear\" is, he says, Helice,[fn-8-P875_224231:154-nf] symbol of a mighty world towards which the Greeks steer their course, that is, for which they are being disciplined. And, wafted by the waves of life, they follow onwards, (having in prospect) some such revolving world or discipline or wisdom which conducts those back that follow in pursuit of such a world. For the term Helice seems to signify a certain circling and revolution towards the same points. There is likewise a certain other \"Small Bear\" (Cynosuris), as it were some image of the second creation-that formed according to God. For few, he says, there are that journey by the narrow path.[fn-8-P876_225210:155-nf] But they assert that Cynosuris is narrow, towards which Aratus[fn-8-P877_225321:156-nf] says that the Sidonians navigate. But Aratus has spoken partly of the Sidonians, (but means) the Phoenicians, on account of the existence of the admirable wisdom of the Phoenicians. The Greeks, however, assert that they are Phoenicians, who have migrated from (the shores of) the Red Sea into this country where they even at present dwell, for this is the opinion of Herodotus.[fn-8-P878_225731:157-nf] Now Cynosura, he says, is this (lesser) Bear, the second creation; the one of limited dimensions, the narrow way, and not Helice. For he does not lead them back, but guides forward by a straight path, those that follow him being (the tail) of Canis. For Canis is the Logos,[fn-8-P879_226033:158-nf] partly guarding and preserving the flock, that is plotted against by the wolves; and partly like a dog, hunting the beasts from the creation, and destroying them; and partly producing all things, and being what they express by the name \"Cyon\" (Canis), that is, generator. Hence it is said, Aratus has spoken of the rising of Canis, expressing himself thus: \"When, however, Canis has risen, no longer do the crops miss.\" This is what he says: Plants that have been put into the earth up to the period of Canis' rising, frequently, though not having struck root, are yet covered with a profusion of leaves, and afford indications to spectators that they will be productive, and that they appear full of life, (though in reality) not having vitality in themselves from the root. But when the rising of Canis takes place, the living are separated from the dead by Canis; for whatsoever plants have not taken root, really undergo putrefaction. This Canis, therefore, he says, as being a certain divine Logos, has been appointed judge of quick and dead. And as (the influence of) Canis is observable in the vegetable productions of this world, so in plants of celestial growth-in men-is beheld the (power of the) Logos. From some such cause, then, Cynosura, the second creation, is set in the firmament as an image of a creation by the Logos. The Dragon, however, in the centre reclines between the two creations, preventing a transition of whatever things are from the great creation to the small creation; and in guarding those that are fixed in the (great) creation, as for instance Engonasis, observing (at the same time) how and in what manner each is constituted in the small creation. And (the Dragon) himself is watched at the head, he says, by Anguitenens. This image, he affirms, is fixed in heaven, being a certain wisdom to those capable of discerning it.

For when the square is multiplied into itself, it becomes a biquadratic; but when the square is multiplied into a cube, it becomes the product of a quadratic and cube; but when a cube is multiplied into a cube, it becomes the product of cube multiplied by cube. Wherefore all the numbers are seven; so that the generation of things produced may be from the hebdomad-which is number, monad, power, cube, biquadratic, product of quadratic multiplied by cube, product of cube multiplied by cube.","index":"212","references":[{"fn":"8","code":"P896_232965","folder":"ANF-05","text":"The observations following have already been made in book i. of The Refutation.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"8","code":"P897_233376","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Some read arsij.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"Of this hebdomad Simon and Valentinus, having altered the names, detailed marvellous stories, from thence hastily adopting a system for themselves.

For the brain, being the dominant portion of the entire body, reposes calm and unmoved, containing within itself the spirit. Such an account, then, is not incredible, but widely differs from the conclusions which these (heretics) attempt to deduce from it. For the brain, on being dissected, has within it what may be called a vaulted chamber. And on either side of this are thin membranes, which they term little wings. Now these are gently moved by the spirit, and in turn propel towards the cerebellum the spirit, which, careering through a certain blood-vessel like a reed, advances towards the pineal gland. And near this is situated the entrance of the cerebellum, which admits the current of spirit, and distributes it into what is styled the spinal marrow. But from them the whole frame participates in the spiritual energy, inasmuch as all the arteries, like a branch, are fastened on from this blood-vessel, the extremity of which terminates in the genital blood-vessels, whence all the (animal) seeds proceeding from the brain through the loin are secreted (in the seminal glands). The form, however, of the brain is like the head of a serpent, respecting which a lengthened discussion is maintained by the professors of knowledge, falsely so named, as we shall prove. Six other coupling ligaments grow out of the brain, which, traversing round the head, and having their termination in (the head) itself, hold bodies together; but the seventh (ligament) proceeds from the cerebellum to the lower parts of the rest of the frame, as we have declared.","index":"214","references":[{"fn":"9","code":"P900_235801","folder":"ANF-05","text":"The Abbe Cruice refers to Censorinus ( De Die Natali, cap. vii. et xiv.), who mentions that two numbers were held in veneration, the seventh (hebdomad) and ninth (ennead).
