For by this number very constantly is perfection figured. For whence is that which is said, \"seven times in a day will I praise thee\"?[fn-50-P5046_2146970:3-nf] Does a man sin who does not praise the Lord so often? What then is \"seven times will I praise,\" but \"I will never cease from praise\"? For he who says \"seven times,\" signifies all time. Whence inthis world there are continual revolutions of seven days. What then is \"seven times in a day will I praise Thee,\" but what is said in another place, \"His praise shall always be in my mouth\"?[fn-50-P5047_2147373:4-nf] With reference to this perfection, John writes to seven Churches.

Of a truth four thousand men were filled by seven loaves; what is more wonderful than this! Yet even this were not enough, had not seven baskets also been filled with the fragments that remained.

The testimony of his fair beauty the Prophet gives me, who saith, \"Thou art fair in beauty above the children of men.\"[fn-50-P5055_2149813:10-nf] The testimony of his deformity another Prophet gives me, who saith, \"We saw Him, and He had no grace, nor beauty; but His countenance was marred, and His whole look[fn-50-P5056_2150023:11-nf] deformed.\"[fn-50-P5057_2150048:12-nf] O Prophet, who saidst, \"Thou art fair in beauty above the children of men;\" thou art contradicted; another Prophet cometh out against thee, and saith, \"Thou speakest falsely. We have seen Him. What is this that thou sayest, `Thou art fair in beauty above the children of men? We have seen Him, and He had no grace nor beauty.'\" Are then these two Prophets at disagreement in the Corner-stone of peace? Both spake of Christ, both spake of the Cornerstone. In the corner the wails unite. If they do not unite, it is not a building, but a ruin. No, the Prophets agree, let us not leave them in strife. Yea, rather let us understand their peace; for they know not how to strive. O Prophet, who saidst, \"Thou art fair in beauty above the children of men;\" where didst thou see Him? Answer me, answer where didst thou see Him? \"Being in the form of God, He thought it not robbery to be equal with God.\"[fn-50-P5058_2150970:13-nf] There I saw Him. Dost thou doubt that He who is \"equal with God\" is \"fair in beauty above the children of men\"? Thou hast answered; now let him answer who said, \"We saw Him, and He had no grace, nor beauty.\" Thou hast said so; tell us where didst thou see Him? He begins from the other's words; where the other ended, there he begins. Where did he end? \"Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God.\" Lo, where he saw Him who was \"fair in beauty above the children of men;\" do thou tell us,where thou sawest that \"He had no grace norbeauty. But He emptied Himself, taking theform of a servant, being made in the likeness ofmen, and found in fashion as a man.\"[fn-50-P5059_2151677:14-nf] Of His deformity he still further says; \"He humbledHimself, having become obedient unto death even the death of the cross.\" Lo, where I saw Him.

What is \"the wedding garment\"? Let us search for it in the Holy Scriptures. What is \"the wedding garment \"?

That the light from heaven rises upon us, that the rain descends from the cloud, the fountains flow, the fields yield their fruit; these are gifts, but common to the good and bad. Let us go to the marriage feast, let us leave the others without, who being called come not. Let us consider the guests themselves, that is, Christians. Baptism is a gift of God, the good and bad have it. The Sacraments of the Altar the good and bad receive together. Saul prophesied for all his wickedness, and in his rage against a holy and most righteous man, even while he was persecuting him, he prophesied.

The Apostle Paul in a certain place has brought me a great collection[fn-50-P5069_2156381:21-nf] of excellent things; he has laid them open before me, and I have said to him, \"Show me, if so be thou hast found among them that `wedding garment.'\" He begins to unfold them one by one, and to say, \"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of Angels, though I have all knowledge, and the gift of prophecy, and all faith, so that I could remove mountains; though I distribute all my goods to the poor, and give my body to be burned.\"[fn-50-P5070_2156833:22-nf] Precious garments! nevertheless, there is not yet here that \"wedding garment.\" Now bring out to us \"the wedding garment.\" Why dost thou keep us in suspense, O Apostle? Peradventure prophecy is a gift of God which both good and bad have not. \"If,\" says He, \"I have not charity, nothing profiteth me.\" See \"the wedding garment;\" put it on, ye guests, that ye may sit down securely. Do not say; \"we are too poor to have that garment.\" Clothe others, and ye are clothed yourselves. It is winter, clothe the naked. Christ is naked; and He will give you that \"wedding garment\" whosoever have it not. Run to Him, beseech Him; He knoweth how to sanctify His faithful ones, He knoweth how to clothe His naked ones. That ye may be able as having \"the wedding garment\" to be free from. the fear of the outer darkness, and the binding of your members and hands and feet; let not your works fail. If they fail, with hands bound what canst thou do? with feet bound, whither wilt thou fly? Keep then that \"wedding garment,\" put it on, and so sit down in security, when He comes to inspect. The Day of Judgment will come; He is now giving a long space, let himwho erewhile was naked now be clothed.","index":"9","references":[{"fn":"50","code":"P5067_2155307","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Vid.
