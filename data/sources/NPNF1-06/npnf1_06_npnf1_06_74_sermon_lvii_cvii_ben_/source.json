Why He said this, the occasion as it were out of which these words arose, is shown to us in the holy Gospel. A certain man appealed to Him against his brother, who had taken away all his patrimony, and gave not back his proper portion to his brother. Ye see then how good a case this appellant had. For he was not seeking to take by violence another's, but was seeking only for his own which had been left him by his parents; these was he demanding back by his appeal to the judgment of the Lord. He had an unrighteous brother; but against an unrighteous brother had he found a righteous Judge. Ought he then in so good a cause to lose that opportunity? Or who would say to his brother, \"Restore to thy brother his portion,\" if Christ would not say it? Would thatjudge be likely to say it, whom perhaps his richer and extortionate brother might corrupt by a bribe? Forlorn then as he was, and despoiled of his father's goods, when he had found such and so great a Judge he goes up to Him, he appeals to, he beseeches Him, he lays his cause before Him in few words. For what occasion was there to set forth his cause at length, when he was speaking to Him who could even see the heart? \"Master,\" he says, \"speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.\"[fn-54-P5455_2310823:3-nf] The Lord did not say to him, \"Let thy brother come.\" No, He neither sent for him to be present, nor in his presence did He say to him who had appealed to Him, \"Prove what thou wast saying.\" He asked for half an inheritance, he asked for half an inheritance on earth; the Lord offered him a whole inheritance in heaven.

He wished to make him something more than man. What more did He wish to make him, from whom He wished to take covetousness away? What more did He wish to make him?

And the wretched man sought counsel, not as to how he should lay the additional produce out, but how he should store it up; and in thinking he discovered an expedient.

But peradventure he was not yet a Christian.

For of very great concernment is it where a man hath the mark of Christ, whether in the forehead, or both in the forehead and the heart. Ye have heard to-day the words of the holy prophet Ezekiel, how that before God sent one to destroy the ungodly people, He first sent one to mark them, and said to him, \"Go and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and moan for the sins of my people that are done in the midst of them.\"[fn-54-P5474_2318596:17-nf] He did not say, \"which[fn-54-P5475_2318636:18-nf] are done without them;\" but \"in the midst of them.\" Yet they \"sigh and moan;\" and therefore are they \"marked on the forehead:\" in the forehead of the inner man, not the outer. For there is a forehead in the face, there is a forehead in the conscience. So it happens that when the inner forehead is stricken, the outer grows red; either red with shame, or pale with fear. So then there is a forehead of the inner man. There were they \"marked\" that they might not be destroyed; because though they did not correct the sins which were \"done in the midst of them,\" yet they sorrowed for them, and by that very sorrow separated themselves; and though separated in God's sight, they were mixed with them in the eyes of men. They are \"marked\" secretly, are not hurt openly. Afterwards the Destroyer is sent, and to him it is said, \"Go, lay waste, spare neither young nor old, male nor female, but come not near those who have the mark on their forehead.\"[fn-54-P5476_2319612:19-nf] How great security is granted to you, my Brethren, who among this people are sighing, and moaning for the iniquities which are being done in the midst of you, and who do them not!","index":"9","references":[{"fn":"54","code":"P5474_2318596","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Ezek ix. 4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"ezekiel","chapter":9,"verses":[4]}]},{"fn":"54","code":"P5475_2318636","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Against the Donatists.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"54","code":"P5476_2319612","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Ezek ix. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"ezekiel","chapter":9,"verses":[6]}]}]},{"text":"8.
