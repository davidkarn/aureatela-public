Now especial need there was of saying this, and of reminding you, Beloved, of this, because as soon as this word was uttered by the reader's voice, there followed upon it the sound of the beating of your breasts, when ye had heard, I mean, what the Lord said, \"I confess to Thee, O Father.\" At the uttering of these words, \"I confess,\" ye beat your breasts. Now what means this beating of the breast, but to show that which lies hid within the breast, and to chastise by the visible beating the secret sin? And why did ye this, but because ye heard, \"I confess to Thee, O Father.\" Ye heard the words \"I confess,\" but ye did not consider, who it is that confesses. But consider now. If Christ, from whom all sin is far removed, said, \"I confess:\" confession does not belong to the sinner only, but sometimes to him also that praiseth God. We confess then, whether in praising God, or accusing ourselves. In either case it is a godly confession, either when thou blamest thyself, who art not without sin, or when thou praisest Him who can have no sin.","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"37","code":"P3743_1630439","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Matt. xi. 25.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":11,"verses":[25]}]},{"fn":"37","code":"P3744_1630475","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Interim.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"37","code":"P3745_1630733","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Vocem.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"2. But if we consider it well: thine own blame is His praise.

Now if he that confesseth sin hath risen again from the dead, who hath raised him? No dead man can raise himself. He only was able to raise Himself, who though His Body was dead, was not dead. For He raised up that which was dead. He raised up Himself, who in Himself was alive, but in His Body that was to be raised was dead. For not the Father only, of whom it was said by the Apostle, \"Wherefore God also hath exalted Him,\"[fn-37-P3748_1632717:5-nf] raised the Son, but the Lord also raised Himself, that is, His Body.

Origen seems to hold the same, at least as regards the (supposed) pre-existent soul of Christ (vid. Huet. Origen, ii. 3. § 6; vid. however De la Rue's note); and the Arians, at least implicitly (Socr. Hist. i. 6, Athan. Orat. contr. Arian, i. 35, iii. 51; and Leporius, Cassian. Incarn. i. 3, 4). The same heresy was imputed to the Nestorians (but falsely according to Garner, in Mar. Merc. pt. i. p. 431), and thereby connected them with the Pelagians, as if unassisted human nature could merit grace. The Church on the other hand, proceeding from Rom. i. 4, taught that the human nature which became the manhood of the Word was predestined to be such by grace before its creation, and became such in the moment of creation. St. Athanasius touches on this subject against the Arians (Orat. i. 46); St. Augustin enlarges on it against the Pelagians (De Praedest. Sanct. 23, 30; De Corrept. et Grat. 30): St. Cyril, against the Nestorians (Contra Nest. iii. p. 83); Vigilius, against the Monophysites (Contra Eutych. v. B. P. t. 4, p. 528, ed. 1624). When St. Augustin says \"that man,\" he is speaking of our Lord's human nature as abstracted from that Divine Person in whom it actually existed, and not as if it ever existed as a separate hypostasis, This use of \"homo\" and a_nqrwpoj is very frequent with the Fathers; what is more startling is the expression \"homo ille,\" yet vid. also Augustin, De Praed.
