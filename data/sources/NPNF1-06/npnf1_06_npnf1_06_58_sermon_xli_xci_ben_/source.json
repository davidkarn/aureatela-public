When the Jews were asked (as we have just now heard out of the Gospel when it was being read), how our Lord Jesus Christ, whom David himself called his Lord was David's Son, they were not able to answer. For what they saw in the Lord, that they knew. For He appeared to them as the Son of man; but as the Son of God He was hidden. Hence it was, that they believed that He could be overcome, and that they derided Him as He hung upon the Tree, saying, \"If He be the Son of God, let Him come down from the Cross, and we will believe on Him.\"[fn-48-P4897_2099310:1-nf] They saw one part of what He was, they knew not the other, \"For had they known Him, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.\"[fn-48-P4898_2099464:2-nf] Yet they knew that the Christ was to be the Son of David. For even now they hope that He will come. They know not that He is come already, but this their ignorance is voluntary. For even if they did not acknowledge Him on the tree, they ought notto have failed to acknowledge Him on His Throne. For in whose Name are all nations called and blessed, but in His whom they think not to have been the Christ? For this Son of David, that is, \"of the seed of David according to the flesh,\" is the Son of Abraham. Now if it was said to Abraham, \"In thy seed shall all nations be blessed;\"[fn-48-P4899_2100062:3-nf] and they see now that in our Christ are all nations blessed, why wait they for what is already come, and fear not that which is yet to come? for our Lord Jesus Christ, making use of a prophetic testimony to assert His authority, called Himself \"the Stone.\" Yea such a stone, \"that whosoever shall stumble against it shall be shaken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grind him to powder.\"[fn-49-P4900_2100477:4-nf] For when this stone is stumbled against, it lieth low; by lying low, it \"shaketh\" him that stumbleth against it; being lifted on high, by its coming down it \"grindeth\" the proud \"to powder.\" Already therefore are the Jews \"shaken\" by that stumbling; it yet remains that by His Glorious Advent they should be \"ground to powder\" also, unless peradventure whilst they are yet alive, they acknowledge Him that they die not.

For to the unworthy is it closed up, it is opened to those who are meet for it. It is not with stones, or clubs, or the fist, or the heel, that we knock unto the Lord. It is the life which knocks, it is to the life that it is opened. The seeking is with the heart, the asking is with the heart, the knocking is with the heart, the opening is to the heart. Now that heart which asks rightly, and knocks and seeks rightly, must be godly. Must first love God for His Own sake (for this is godliness); and not propose to itself any reward which it looks for from Him other than God Himself. For than Him is there nothing better. And what precious thing can he ask of God, in whose sight God Himself is lightly esteemed? He giveth earth, and thou rejoicest, thou lover of the earth, who art thyself become earth. If when He giveth earthly goods, thou dost rejoice, how much more oughtest thou to rejoice when He giveth thee Himself, who made heaven and earth? So then God must be loved for His own sake.For the Devil not knowing what was passing in the heart of holy Job, brought this as a great charge against him, saying, \"Doth Job worship God for His Own sake.\"[fn-49-P4910_2104079:12-nf] ","index":"5","references":[{"fn":"49","code":"P4907_2102729","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"John xiv. 28.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":14,"verses":[28]}]},{"fn":"49","code":"P4908_2102792","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"John x. 30.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":10,"verses":[30]}]},{"fn":"49","code":"P4909_2102841","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Sacramentum.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"49","code":"P4910_2104079","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Job i. 9.

For with a very slanderous accuser have we to deal. If he seek to invent what is not, how much more will he seek to object what really is. Nevertheless let us rejoice, that ours is such a Judge, as cannot be deceived by our accuser. For if we had a man for our judge, the enemy might invent for him what he would. For none is more subtle in invention than the devil. For he it is who at this time also invents all false accusations against the saints. He knows his accusations can have no avail with God, and so He scatters them among men. Yet what does this profit him,seeing the Apostle says, \"Our glorying is this, the testimony of our conscience?\"[fn-49-P4912_2104851:13-nf] Yet think ye that he does not invent these false charges with aught of subtlety? Yes, well he knows what evil he shall work thereby, if the watchfulness of faith resist him not. For for this reason scatters he his evil charges against the good, that the weak may think that there are no good, and so may give themselves up to be hurried along, and made a prey of by their lusts, whilst they say within themselves, \"For who is there that keeps the commandments of God, or who is there that preserves chastity?\" and whilst he thinks that no one does, he himself becomes that no one. This then is the devil's art. But such a man was Job, that he could not invent any such charge against him; for his life was too well known and manifest. But because he had great riches, he brought that against him, which if it had any existence, might lie in the heart, and not appear in the conduct. He worshipped God, he gave alms; and with what heart he did this none knew, no not the Devil himself; but God had known. God giveth His testimony to His own servant; the Devil calumniates the servant of God. He is allowed to be tried, Job is proved, the Devil is confounded. Job is found to worship God for His Own sake, to love Him for His Own sake; not because He gave him ought, but because He did not take away Himself.

Because then, in order to understand the mystery[fn-49-P4915_2106527:15-nf] of God, how Christ is both man and God, the heart must be cleansed: and it is cleansed by a good conversation, by a pure life,[fn-49-P4916_2106672:16-nf] by chastity, and sanctity, and love, and by \"faith, which worketh by love\"[fn-49-P4917_2106758:17-nf] (now all this that I am speaking of, is, as it were, the tree which hath its root in the heart; for it is only from the root of the heart that actions proceed; in which if thou plant desire, thorns spring forth; if thou plant charity, good fruit): the Lord, after that question which He had proposed to the Jews, when they were not able to answer it, immediately went on to speak of good actions, that He might show why they were unworthy to understand what He asked them. For when those proud and wretched men were not able to answer, they ought of course to. have said, \"we do not know; Master, tell us.\" But no: they were speechless at the proposing of the question, and they opened not their mouth to seek instruction. And so the Lord in reference to their pride said immediately, \"Beware of the Scribes which love the chief seats in the synagogues, and the first rooms at feasts.\"[fn-49-P4918_2107661:18-nf] Not because they hold them, but because they love them. For in these words he accused their heart. Now none can accuse the heart, but He who can inspect it. For meet it is that to the servant of God, who holds some post of honour in the Church, the first place should be assigned; because if it were not given him, it were evil for him who refuses to give it; but yet it is no good to him to whom it is given. It is meet and right then that in the congregation of Christians their Prelates[fn-49-P4919_2108186:19-nf] should sit in eminent place, that by their very seat they may be distinguished, and that their office may be duly marked; yet not so that they should be puffed up for their seat; but that they should esteem it a burden, for which they are to render an account. But who knows whether they love this, or do not love it? This is a matter of the heart, it can have no other judge but God. Now the Lord Himself warned His disciples, that they should not fall into this leaven; as He calls it in another place, \"Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.\"[fn-49-P4920_2108779:20-nf] And when they supposed that He said this to them because they had brought no bread; He answered them, \"Have ye forgotten how many thousands were filled with the five loaves? Then understood they,\" it is said, \"that He called their doctrine leaven.\"[fn-49-P4921_2109047:21-nf] For these present temporal good things they loved, but they neither feared the evil things eternal, nor loved the good things eternal.
