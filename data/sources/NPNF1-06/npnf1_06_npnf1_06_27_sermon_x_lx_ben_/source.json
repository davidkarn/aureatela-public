Every man who is in any trouble, and his own resources fail him, looks out for some prudent person from whom he may take counsel, and so know what to do. Let us suppose then the whole world to be as it were one single man. He seeks to escape evil, yet is slow in doing good; and as in this way tribulations thicken, and his own resources fail, whom can he find more prudent to receive counsel from than Christ? By all means, at least, let him find a better, and do what he will. But if he cannot find a better, let him come to Him whom he may find everywhere: let him consult, and take advice from Him, keep the good commandment, escape the great evil. For present temporal ills of which men are so sore afraid, under which they murmur exceedingly, and by their murmuring offend Him who is correcting them, so that they find not His saving Help;[fn-34-P3489_1519371:1-nf] present ills I say without a doubt are but passing; either they pass through us, or we pass through them; either they pass away whilst we live, or they are left behind us when we die. Now that is not in the matter of tribulation great, which in duration is short. Whosoever thou art that art thinking of to-morrow, thou dost not recall the remembrance of yesterday. When the day after to-morrow comes, this to-morrow also will be yesterday; But now if men are so disquieted with anxiety to escape temporal tribulations which pass, or rather fly over, what thought ought they to take that they may escape those which abide and endure without end?","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"34","code":"P3489_1519371","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Salvatorem.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"2. A hard condition is the life of man. What else is it to be born, but to enter on a life of toil? Of our toil that is to be, the infant's very cry is witness. From this cup[fn-34-P3491_1520206:2-nf] of sorrow no one may be excused. The cup that Adam hath pledged, must be drunk. We were made, it is true, by the hands of Truth, but because of sin we were cast forth upon days of vanity. \"We were made after the image of God,\"[fn-34-P3492_1520446:3-nf] but we[fn-34-P3493_1520468:4-nf] disfigured it by sinful transgression. Therefore does the Psalm remind us how we were made, and to what a state we have come. For it says \"Though a man walk in the image[fn-34-P3494_1520653:5-nf] of God.\" See, what he was made. Whither hath he come? Hearken to what follows, \"Yet will he be disquieted in vain.\"[fn-34-P3495_1521012:6-nf] He walks in the image of truth, and will be disquieted in the counsel of vanity. Finally, see his disquiet, see it, and as it were in a glass, be displeased with thyself. \"Though,\" he says, \"man walk in the image of God,\" and therefore be something great, \"yet will he be disquieted in vain;\" and as though we might ask, How: I pray thee, how is man disquieted in vain? \"He heapeth up treasure,\" saith he, \"and knoweth not for whom he doth gather it.\" See then, this man, that is the whole human race represented as one man, who is without resource in his own case, and hath lost counsel and wandered out of the way of a sound mind; \"Heapeth up treasure, and knoweth not for whom he doth gather it.\" What is more mad, what more unhappy? But surely he is doing it for himself? Not so. Why not for himself? Because he must die, because the life of man is short, because the treasure lasts, but he who gathereth it, quickly passeth away. As pitying therefore the man who \"walketh in the image of God,\" who confesseth things that are true, yet followeth after vain things, he saith, \"He will be disquieted in vain.\" I grieve for him; \"he heapeth up treasure, and knoweth not for whom he doth gather it.\" Doth he gather it for himself? No. Because the man dies whilst the treasure endures. For whom then? If thou hast any good counsel, give it to me. But counsel hast thou none to give me, and so thou hast none for thyself. Wherefore if we are both without it, let us both seek it, let us both receive it, and both consider the matter together. He is disquieted, he heapeth up treasure, he thinks, and toils, and is kept awake by anxiety. All day long art thou harassed by labour, all night agitated by fear. That thy coffer may be filled with money, thy soul is in a fever of anxiety.","index":"4","references":[{"fn":"34","code":"P3491_1520206","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Convivio.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"34","code":"P3492_1520446","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Gen. i. 27.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":1,"verses":[27]}]},{"fn":"34","code":"P3493_1520468","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Detrivimus.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"34","code":"P3494_1520653","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"St. Ambrose, ad loc., observes that Dei is not in the Greek but explains \"in imagine\" in the same sense, as does St. Augustin, ad loc., where he had not \"Dei.\" It seems a sort of gloss.

I see it, I am grieved for thee; thou art disquieted, and as He who cannot deceive, assures us, \"Thou art disquieted in vain.\" For thou art heaping up treasures: supposing that all thy undertakings succeed, to say nothing of losses, of so great perils and deaths in the prosecution of every several kind of gain (I speak not of deaths of the body, but of evil thoughts, for that gold may come in, uprightness[fn-34-P3497_1523259:7-nf] goeth out; that thou mayest be clothed outwardly, thou art made naked within), but to pass over these, and other such things in silence, to pass by all the things that are against thee, let us think only of the favourable circumstances. See, thou art laying up treasures, gains flow into thee from every quarter, and thy money runs like fountains; everywhere where want presseth, there doth abundance flow. Hast thou not heard, \"If riches increase, set not your heart upon them?\"[fn-34-P3498_1523749:8-nf] Lo, thou art getting, thou art disquieted, not fruitlessly indeed, still in vain. \"How,\" thou wilt ask \"am I disquieted in vain? I am filling my coffers, my walls will scarce hold what I get, how then am I disquieted in vain?\" \"Thou art heaping up treasure, and dost not know for whom thou gatherest it.\" Or if thou dost know, I pray thee tell me. I will listen to thee. For whom is it? If thou art not disquieted in vain, tell me for whom thou art heaping up thy treasure? \"For myself,\" thou sayest, Dost thou dare say so, who must so soon die? \"For my children.\" Dost thou dare say this of them who must so soon die? It is a great duty of natural affection[fn-34-P3499_1524426:9-nf] (it will be said) for a father to lay up for his sons; rather it is a great vanity, one who must soon die is laying up for those who must soon die also. If it is for thyself, why dost thou gather, seeing thou leavest all when thou diest. This is the case also with thy children; they will succeed thee, but not to abide long. I say nothing about what sort of children they may be, whether haply debauchery may not waste what covetousness hath amassed. So another by dissoluteness[fn-35-P3500_1524918:10-nf] squanders what thou by much toil hast gathered together. But I pass over this. It may be they will be good children, they will not be dissolute, they will keep what thou hast left, will increase what thou hast kept, and will not dissipate what thou hast heaped together. Then will thy children be equally vain with thyself, if they do so, if in this they imitate thee their father. I would say to them what I said just now to thee. I would say to thy son, to him for whom thou art saving I would say, \"Thou art heaping up treasure, and knowest not for whom thou dost gather it.\" For as thou knewest not, so neither doth he know.

It may be thou art laying up for a robber, or a highwayman. I will say no more on this, lest I call to mind and re-open the wound of past sufferings. How many things which an empty vanity hath heaped together, hath the cruelty of an enemy found ready to its hand. It is not my place to wish for this: but it is the concern of all to fear it. May God avert it! May His own scourges be sufficient. May He to whom we pray, spare us! But if He ask thee for whom are we laying by, what shall we answer? How then, O man, whosoever thou art, that are heaping up treasure in vain, how wilt thou answer me, as I handle this matter with thee, and with thee seek counsel in a common cause?

Thou hast heard and at length learnt wisdom, because when thou sayest, \"Perhaps it is for my children,\" but dost not dare to say, \"I am sure that it is for my children,\" thou dost not in fact know for whom thou art gathering riches.

One is in need before thee, and thou art in need before Another,and since thou art in need before Another, and another is in need before thee, that other is in need before him who is in need himself. For He before whom thou art in need, needeth nothing. Do then to others as thou wouldest have done to thee. For it is not in this case as with those friends who are wont to upbraid in a way one another with their kindnesses; as, \"I did this for thee,\" and the other answers, \"and I this for thee,\" that He wishes us to do Him some good office, because He has first done such an office for us. He is in want of nothing, and therefore is He the very Lord. I said unto the Lord, \"Thou art my God, for Thou needest not my goods.\"[fn-35-P3532_1541552:34-nf] Notwithstanding though He be the Lord, and the Very Lord, and needeth not our goods, yet that we might do something even for Him, hath He vouchsafed to be hungry in His poor. \"I was hungry,\" saith He, \"and ye gave Me meat. Lord, when saw we Thee hungry? Forasmuch as ye did it to one of the least of Mine, ye did it to Me.\"[fn-35-P3533_1541925:35-nf] To be brief then, let men hear, and consider as they ought, how great a merit it is to have fed Christ when He hungereth, and how great a crime it is to have despised Christ when He hungereth.","index":"13","references":[{"fn":"35","code":"P3531_1540738","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"John vi. 35.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":6,"verses":[35]}]},{"fn":"35","code":"P3532_1541552","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Ps. xv. 2, Sept.

Repentance for sins changes men, it is true, for the better; but it does not appear as if even it would profit ought, if it should be barren of works of mercy. This the Truth testifieth by the mouth of John, who said to them that came to him, \"O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance; And say not we have Abraham to our father; for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. For now is the axe laid unto the root of the trees.Every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit shall be cut down, and cast into the fire.\"[fn-35-P3535_1542799:36-nf] Touching this fruit he said above, \"Bring forth fruits worthy of repentance.\" Whoso then bringeth not forth these fruits, hath no cause to think that he shall attain[fn-35-P3536_1542988:37-nf] pardon for his sins by a barren repentance. Now what these fruits are, he showeth afterwards himself. For after these his words the multitude asked him, saying, \"What shall we do then?\" That is, what are these fruits, which thou exhortest us with such alarming force to bring forth? \"But he answering said unto them, he that hath two coats, let him give to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.\" My brethren, what is more plain, what more certain, or express than this? What other meaning then can that have which he said above, \"Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, shall be cut down, and cast into the fire;\" but that same which they on the left shall hear, \"Go ye into everlasting fire, for I was hungry, and ye gave Me no meat.\" So then it is but a small matter to depart from sins, if thou shalt neglect to cure what is past, as it is written, \"Son, thou hast sinned, do so no more.\" And that he might not think to be secure by this only, he saith, \"And for thy former sins pray that they may be forgiven thee.\"[fn-35-P3537_1544054:38-nf] But what will it profit thee to pray for forgiveness, if thou shall not make thyself meet to be heard, by not bringing forth fruits meet for repentance, that thou shouldest be cut down as a barren tree, and be cast into the fire? If then ye will be heard when ye pray for pardon of your sins, \"Forgive, and it shall be forgiven you; Give, and it shall be given you.\"[fn-35-P3538_1544442:39-nf] ","index":"14","references":[{"fn":"35","code":"P3535_1542799","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Luke iii. 7, etc.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":3,"verses":[7]}]},{"fn":"35","code":"P3536_1542988","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Mereri.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"35","code":"P3537_1544054","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Ecclus. xxi. 1.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"35","code":"P3538_1544442","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Luke vi. 37, 38.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":6,"verses":[37]}]}]},{"text":"","index":"15","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"16","references":[]}]}]}
