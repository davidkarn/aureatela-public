We have heard the True Master, the Divine Redeemer, the human Saviour, commending to us our Ransom, His Blood. For He spake to us of His Body and Blood; He called His Body Meat, His Blood Drink. The faithful recognise the Sacrament of the faithful. But the hearers what else do they but hear? When therefore commending such Meat and such Drink He said, \"Except ye shall eat My Flesh and drink My Blood, ye shall have no life in you; \"[fn-62-P6265_2652203:1-nf] (and this that He said concerning life, who else said it but the Life Itself? But that man shall have death, not life, who shall think that the Life is false), His disciples were offended, not all of them indeed, but very many, saying within themselves, \"This is an hard saying, who can hear it? \"[fn-62-P6266_2652517:2-nf] But when the Lord knew this in Himself, and heard the murmurings of their thought, He answered them, thinking though uttering nothing, that they might understand that they were heard, and might cease to entertain such thoughts. What then did He answer? \"Doth this offend you?\"\"What then if ye shall see the Son of Man ascend up where He was before?\"[fn-62-P6267_2652883:3-nf] What meaneth this? \"Doth this offend you?\" \"Do ye imaginethat I am about to make divisions of this My Body which ye see; and to cut up My Members, and give them to you? `What then if ye shall see the Son of Man ascend up where He was before?'\" Assuredly, He who could ascend Whole could not be consumed. So then He both gave us of His Body and Blood a healthful refreshment, and briefly solved so great a question as to His Own Entireness. Let them then who eat, eat on, and them that drink, drink; let them hunger and thirst; eat Life, drink Life. That eating, is to be refreshed; but thou art in such wise refreshed, as that that whereby thou art refreshed, faileth not. That drinking, what is it but to live? Eat Life, drink Life; thou shalt have life, and the Life is Entire. But then this shall be, that is, the Body and the Blood of Christ shall be each man's Life; if what is taken in the Sacrament visibly is in the truth itself eaten spiritually, drunk spiritually. For we have heard the Lord Himself saying, \"It is the Spirit That quickeneth, but the flesh profiteth nothing. The words that I have spoken unto you, are Spirit and Life. But there are some of you,\" saith He, \"that believe not.\"[fn-62-P6268_2654107:4-nf] Such were they who said, \"This is a hard saying, who can hear it?\" It is hard, but only to the hard; that is, it is incredible, but only to the incredulous.","index":"4","references":[{"fn":"62","code":"P6265_2652203","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"John vi. 53.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":6,"verses":[53]}]},{"fn":"62","code":"P6266_2652517","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"John vi. 60.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":6,"verses":[60]}]},{"fn":"62","code":"P6267_2652883","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"John vi. 61, 62.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":6,"verses":[61]}]},{"fn":"62","code":"P6268_2654107","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"John vi. 63, 64.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":6,"verses":[63]}]}]},{"text":"2.

But some, as the Jews in former times, both wish to be called Christians, and still ignorant of God's righteousness, desire to establish their own, even in our own times, in the times of open grace, the times of the full revelation of grace which before was hidden; in the times of grace now manifested in the floor, which once lay hid in the fleece. I see that a few have understood me, that more have not understood, whom I will by no means defraud by keeping silence. Gideon, one of the righteous men of old, asked for a sign from the Lord, and said, \"I pray, Lord, that this fleece which I put in the floor be bedewed,[fn-63-P6307_2667359:35-nf] and that the floor be dry.\"[fn-63-P6308_2667404:36-nf] And it was so; the fleece was bedewed, the whole floor was dry.

Call to mind the time of the Old Testament, grace was hidden in a cloud, as the rain in the fleece. Mark now the time of the New Testament, consider well the nation of the Jews, thou wilt find it as a dry fleece; whereas the whole world, like that floor, is full of grace, not hidden, but manifested. Wherefore we are forced exceedingly to bewail our brethren, who strive not against hidden, but against open and manifested grace. There is allowance for the Jews. What shall we say of Christians? Wherefore are ye enemies to the grace of Christ? Why rely ye on yourselves? Why unthankful? For why did Christ come? Was not nature here before? Was not nature here, which ye only deceive by your excessive praise? Was not the Law here?
