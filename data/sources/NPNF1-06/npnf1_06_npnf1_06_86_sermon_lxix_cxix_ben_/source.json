That our Lord Jesus Christ in seeking lost man was made Man, our preaching has never withholden, and your faith has ever retained; and moreover, that this our Lord, who for our sakes was made Man, was always God with the Father, and always will be, yea rather always Is; for where there is no succession of thee, there is no \"hath been\" and \"will be.\" For that of which it is said, \"it hath been,\" is now no more; that of which it is said, \"it will be,\" is not yet; but He always is, because He truly \"is,\" that is, is unchangeable. For the Gospel lesson has just now taught us a high and divine mystery. For this beginning of the Gospel St. John poured forth[fn-58-P5804_2466323:1-nf] for that he drank it in from the Lord's Breast. For ye remember, that it has been very lately read to you, how that this St. John the Evangelist lay in the Lord's Bosom.[fn-58-P5805_2466507:2-nf] And wishing to explain this clearly, he says, \"On the Lord's Breast;\"[fn-58-P5806_2466595:3-nf] that we might understand what he meant, by \"in the Lord's bosom.\" For what, think we, did he drink in who was lying on the Lord's Breast? Nay, let us not think, but drink;[fn-58-P5807_2466785:4-nf] for we too have just now heard what we may drink in.","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"58","code":"P5804_2466323","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Ructuavit.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"58","code":"P5805_2466507","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"John xiii. 23.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":13,"verses":[23]}]},{"fn":"58","code":"P5806_2466595","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"John xiii. 25.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":13,"verses":[25]}]},{"fn":"58","code":"P5807_2466785","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Non putemus sed potemus.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"2. \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\"[fn-58-P5809_2466950:5-nf] O glorious preaching!

All our words sound, and pass away. Who can comprehend the abiding Word, save He who abideth in Him? Wouldest thou comprehend the abiding Word? Do not follow the current of the flesh.

I am treating of the Word, and perchance the word of men may furnish somewhat like; though very unequal, far distant, in no comparable, yet something which may convey a hint to you by way of resemblance.

As then my word was brought forth to thy sense, yet did not depart from my heart; so That Word came forth to our senses, yet departed not from His Father. My word was with me, and it came forth into a voice: the Word of God was with the Father, and came forth into Flesh. But can I do with my voice that which He could do with His Flesh? For I am not master[fn-58-P5820_2472851:11-nf] of my voice as it flies; He is not only master of His Flesh, that It should be born, live, act; but even when dead He raised It up, and exalted unto the Father the Vehicle as it were in which He came forth to us. You may call the Flesh of Christ a Garment, you may call It a Vehicle, and as perchance Himself vouchsafed to teach us, you may call It His Beast; for on this beast He raised him who had been wounded by robbers;[fn-58-P5821_2473289:12-nf] lastly, as He said Himself more expressly, you may call It a Temple; This Temple knows death no more, Its seat is at the right Hand of the Father: in This Temple shall He come to judge the quick and dead.
