If any one will piously and soberly consider the sermon which our Lord Jesus Christ spoke on the mount, as we read it in the Gospel according to Matthew, I think that he will find in it, so far as regards the highest morals, a perfect standard of the Christian life: and this we do not rashly venture to promise, but gather it from the very words of the Lord Himself. For the sermon itself is brought to a close in such a way, that it is clear there are in it all the precepts which go to mould the life. For thus He speaks: \"Therefore, whosoever heareth these words of mine, and doeth them, I will liken[fn-2-P219_27390:1-nf] him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat[fn-2-P220_27624:2-nf] upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. And every one that heareth these words of mine, and doeth them not, I will liken[fn-2-P221_27814:3-nf] unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.\" Since, therefore, He has not simply said, \"Whosoever heareth my words,\" but has made an addition, saying, \"Whosoever heareth these words of mine,\" He has sufficiently indicated, as I think, that these sayings which He uttered on the mount so perfectly guide the life of those who may be willing to live according to them, that they may justly be compared to one building upon a rock. I have said this merely that it may be clear that the sermon before us is perfect in all the precepts by which the Christian life is moulded; for as regards this particular section a more careful treatment will be given in its own place.[fn-2-P222_28700:4-nf] ","index":"27","references":[{"fn":"2","code":"P219_27390","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Similabo.

Augustin regards it as a perfect code of morals. Tholuck (Die Bergpredigt) calls it \"the Magna Charta of the kingdom of heaven.\" Lange says, \"The grand fundamental idea is to present the righteousness of the kingdom of heaven in its relation to that of the Old Testament theocracy.\" Geikie declares it to be the \"formal inauguration of the kingdom of God and the Magna Charta of our faith.\" Edersheim regards it as presenting \"the full delineation of the ideal man of God, of prayer, and of righteousness; in short, of the inward and outward manifestation of discipleship.\" Meyer (Com. 6th ed. p. 210) says that the aim of Jesus is, as the One who fulfils the Law and the Prophets, to present the moral conditions of participation in the Messianic kingdom. Weiss (Leben Jesu) speaks of it as being \"as little an ethical discourse as a new proclamation of law. It is nothing else than an announcement of the kingdom of God, in which is visible everywhere the purpose of Jesus to distinguish between its righteousness and the righteousness revealed in the Old Testament as well as that taught by the teachers of his day.\"","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"2. The beginning, then, of this sermon is introduced as follows: \"And when He saw the great[fn-2-P224_32704:5-nf] multitudes, He went up into a mountain:[fn-2-P225_32789:6-nf] and when He was set, His disciples came unto Him: and He opened His mouth, and taught them, saying.\" If it is asked what the \"mountain\" means, it may well be understood as meaning the greater precepts of righteousness; for there were lesser ones which were given to the Jews. Yet it is one God who, through His holy prophets and servants, according to a thoroughly arranged distribution of times, gave the lesser precepts to a people who as yet required to be bound by fear; and who, through His Son, gave the greater ones to a people whom it had now become suitable to set free by love. Moreover, when the lesser are given to the lesser, and the greater to the greater, they are given by Him who alone knows how to present to the human race the medicine suited to the occasion. Nor is it surprising that the greater precepts are given for the kingdom of heaven, and the lesser for an earthly kingdom, by that one and the same God, who made heaven and earth. With respect, therefore, to that righteousness which is the greater, it is said through the prophet, \"Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God:\"[fn-2-P226_34813:7-nf] and this may well mean that the one Master alone fit to teach matters of so great importance teaches on a mountain. Then He teaches sitting, as behooves the dignity of the instructor's office; and His disciples come to Him, in order that they might be nearer in body for hearing His words, as they also approached in spirit to fulfil His precepts. \"And He opened His mouth, and taught them, saying.\" The circumlocution before us, which runs, \"And He opened His mouth,\" perhaps gracefully intimates by the mere pause that the sermon will be somewhat longer than usual, unless, perchance, it should not be without meaning, that now He is said to have opened His own mouth, whereas under the old law He was accustomed to open the mouths of the prophets.[fn-2-P227_35582:8-nf] ","index":"28","references":[{"fn":"2","code":"P224_32704","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Multas turbas.

The hill, which is horned like a saddle, is south-west of Capernaum, and commands a good view of the Lake of Galilee. It seems to meet the requirements of the text. Robinson says there are a dozen other hills as eligible as this one. Tholuck enlarges upon the \"beautiful temple of nature in which the Lord delivered the sermon.\" Matthew Henry says, \"When the law was given, the Lord came down upon the mountain, now the Lord went up; then He spake in thunder and lightning, now in a still, small voice; then the people were ordered to keep their distance, now they are invited to draw near,-a blessed change!\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"2","code":"P226_34813","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Ps. xxxvi. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":36,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"2","code":"P227_35582","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Chrysostom, Euthymius, etc., see in the expression the implication that Christ also taught by works.

Some (Olearius, Michaelis, Paulus) have joined \"in spirit\" with \"blessed.\" Augustin explains the passage of those who are not elated or proud, taking \"spirit\" in an evil sense. In another place he says, \"Blessed are the poor in their own spirit, rich in God's Spirit, for every man who follows his own spirit is proud.\" He then compares him who subdues his own spirit to one living in a valley which is filled with water from the hills (En. in Ps. cxli. 4).

For the beatitudes begin with humility: \"Blessed are the poor in spirit,\" i.e. those not puffed up, while the soul submits itself to divine authority, fearing lest after this life it go away to punishment, although perhaps in this life it might seem to itself to be happy. Then it (the soul) comes to the knowledge of the divine Scriptures, where it must show itself meek in its piety, lest it should venture to condemn that which seems absurd to the unlearned, and should itself be rendered unteachable by obstinate disputations. After that, it now begins to know in what entanglements of this world it is held by reason of carnal custom and sins: and so in this third stage, in which there is knowledge, the loss of the highest good is mourned over, because it sticks fast in what is lowest. Then, in the fourth stage there is labour, where vehement exertion is put forth, in order that the mind may wrench itself away from those things in which, by reason of their pestilential sweetness, it is entangled: here therefore righteousness is hungered and thirsted after, and fortitude is very necessary; because what is retained with delight is not abandoned without pain. Then, at the fifth stage, to those persevering in labour, counsel for getting rid of it is given; for unless each one is assisted by a superior, in no way is he fit in his own case to extricate himself from so great entanglements of miseries. But it is a just counsel, that he who wishes to be assisted by a stronger should assist him who is weaker in that in which he himself is stronger: therefore \"blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.\" At the sixth stage there is purity of heart, able from a good conscience of good works to contemplate that, highest good, which can be discerned by the pure and tranquil intellect alone. Lastly is the seventh, wisdom itself-i.e. the contemplation of the truth, tranquillizing the whole man, and assuming the likeness of God, which is thus summed up: \"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.\" The eighth, as it were, returns to the starting-point, because it shows and commends what is complete and perfect:[fn-2-P260_49244:28-nf] therefore in the first and in the eighth the kingdom of heaven is named, \"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven;\" and, \"Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven:\" as it is now said, \"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?\"[fn-2-P261_49953:29-nf] Seven in number, therefore, are the things which bring perfection: for the eighth brings into light and shows what is perfect, so that starting, as it were, from the beginning again, the others also are perfected by means of these stages.","index":"39","references":[{"fn":"2","code":"P260_49244","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"\"In the eighth beatitude the other seven are only summed up under the idea of the righteousness of the kingdom in its relation to those who persecute it; while the ninth is a description of the eighth, with reference to the relation in which these righteous persons stand to Christ\" (Lange).","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"2","code":"P261_49953","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Rom. viii. 35.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":8,"verses":[35]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter IV.","index":6,"paragraphs":[{"text":"11.

Fortitude corresponds to those hungering and thirsting: for they labour in earnestly desiring joy from things that are truly good, and in eagerly seeking to turn away their love from earthly and corporeal things: and of them it is here said, \"Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst afterrighteousness.\" Counsel corresponds to the merciful: for this is the one remedy for escaping from so great evils, that we forgive, as we wish to be ourselves forgiven; and that we assist others so far as we are able, as we ourselves desire to be assisted where we are not able: and of them it is here said, \"Blessed are the merciful.\" Understanding corresponds to the pure in heart, the eye being as it were purged, by which that may be beheld which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, and what hath not entered into the heart of man:[fn-2-P268_52468:33-nf] and of them it is here said,\" Blessed are the pure in heart.\" Wisdom corresponds to the peacemakers, in whom all things are now brought into order, and no passion is in a state of rebellion against reason, but all things together obey the spirit of man, while he himself also obeys God: and of them it is here said, \"Blessed are the peacemakers.\"[fn-2-P269_52851:34-nf] ","index":"41","references":[{"fn":"2","code":"P265_50304","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Isa. xi. 2, 3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":11,"verses":[2]}]},{"fn":"2","code":"P266_51026","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Rom. xi. 20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":11,"verses":[20]}]},{"fn":"2","code":"P267_51073","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Augustin follows the Septuagint, which has \"piety\" instead of \"the fear of the Lord\" in the last clause of Isa. xi. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":11,"verses":[2]}]},{"fn":"2","code":"P268_52468","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Isa. lxiv. 4 and 1 Cor. ii. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":64,"verses":[4]},{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":2,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"2","code":"P269_52851","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"This is guarded against misconstruction in the Retract.

It becomes savourless. Dr. Thomson says (Land and Book, ii. 43), \"It is a well-known fact that the salt in this country (gathered from the marshes in dry weather), when in contact with the ground, or exposed to air and sun, does become insipid and useless.\" The disciples are appointed to communicate the truth and moral grace, before spoken of in the Beatitudes, to counteract the error and corruption m the earth. \"Earth\" not to be confined to \"society as then existing, the definite form the world then presented\" (Lange), but to mankind in general, as Augustin below. \"Wherewith shall it be salted\" does not imply that those who have once fallen cannot be reclaimed (Alford).

Or does the bushel measure also mean something, so that to place a candle under a bushel is this, to place the comforts of the body higher than the preaching of the truth; so that one does not preach the truth so long as he is afraid of suffering any annoyance in corporeal and temporal things? And it is well said a bushel measure, whether on account of the recompense of measure, for each one receives the things done in his body,-\"that every one,\" says the apostle, \"may there receive[fn-3-P304_66235:59-nf] the things done in his body;\" and it is said in another place, as if of this bushel measure of the body, \"For with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again: \"[fn-3-P305_66539:60-nf] -or because temporal good things, which are carried to completion in the body, are both begun and come to an end in a certain definite number of days, which is perhaps meant by the \"bushel measure;\" while eternal and spiritual things are confined within no such limit, \"for God giveth not the Spirit by measure.\"[fn-3-P306_66871:61-nf] Every one, therefore, who obscures and covers up the light of good doctrine by means of temporal comforts, places his candle under a bushel measure. \"But on a candlestick.\"[fn-3-P307_67173:62-nf] Now it is placed on a candlestick by him who subordinates his body to the service of God, so that the preaching of the truth is the higher, and the serving of the body the lower; yet by means even of the service of the body the doctrine shines more conspicuously, inasmuch as it is insinuated into those who learn by means of bodily functions, i.e. by means of the voice and tongue, and the other movements of the body in good works. The apostle therefore puts his candle on a candlestick, when he says, \"So fight I, not as one that beateth[fn-3-P308_67732:63-nf] the air; but I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection, lest that by any means, when I preach to others, I myself should be found a castaway.\"[fn-3-P309_67918:64-nf] When He says, however, \"that it may give light to all who are in the house,\" I am of opinion that it is the abode of men which is called a house, i.e. the world itself, on account of what He says before, \"Ye are the light of the world;\" or if any one chooses to understand the house as being the Church, this, too, is not out of place.","index":"49","references":[{"fn":"2","code":"P299_63840","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Lumen, also used for a luminary; Vulgate, lux.

Then, as to what He says, \"One iota or one tittle shall in nowise pass from the law,\" nothing else can be understood but a strong expression of perfection, since it is pointed out by means of single letters, among which letters \"iota\" is smaller than the others, for it is made by a single stroke; while a \"tittle\" is but a particle of some sort at the top of even that. And by these words He shows that in the law all the smallest particulars even are to be carried into effect.[fn-3-P327_73094:75-nf] After that He subjoins: \"Whosoever, therefore, shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven.\" Hence it is the least commandments that are meant by \"one iota\" and \"one tittle.\" And therefore, \"whosoever shall break and shall teach [men] so,\"-i.e. in accordance with what he breaks, not in accordance with what he finds and reads,-\"shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven;\" and therefore, perhaps, he will not be in the kingdom of heaven at all, where only the great can be. \"But whosoever shall do and teach [men] so,\"[fn-3-P328_74149:76-nf] -i.e. who shall not break, and shall teach men so, in accordance with what he does not break,-\"shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\" But in regard to him who shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven, it follows that he is also in the kingdom of heaven, into which the great are admitted: for to this what follows refers.","index":"54","references":[{"fn":"3","code":"P324_71387","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Here begins the second part of the Sermon.

But you say to me: If, when He was speaking above of those least commandments, He said that whosoever shall break one of them, and shall teach in accordance with his transgression, is called the least in the kingdom of heaven; but that whosoever shall do them, and shall teach [men] so, is called great, and hence will be already in the kingdom of heaven, because he is great: what need is there for additions to the least precepts of the law, if he can be already in the kingdom of heaven, because whosoever shall do them, and shall so teach, is great? For this reason that sentence is to be understood thus: \"But whosoever shall do and teach men so, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven,\"-i.e. not in accordance with those least commandments, but in accordance with those which I am about to mention.

But in order that he may be great and fit for that kingdom, he ought to do and teach as Christ now teaches, i.e. in order that his righteousness may exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees. The righteousness of the Pharisees is, that they shall not kill; the righteousness of those who are destined to enter into the kingdom of God, that they be not angry without a cause. The least commandment, therefore, is not to kill; and whosoever shall break that, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whosoever shall fulfil that commandment not to kill, will not, as a necessary consequence, be great and meet for the kingdom of heaven, but yet he ascends a certain step. He will be perfected, however, if he be not angry without a cause; and if he shall do this, he will be much further removed from murder. For this reason he who teaches that we should not be angry, does not break the law not to kill, but rather fulfils it; so that we preserve our innocence both outwardly when we do not kill, and in heart when we are not angry.","index":"56","references":[{"fn":"3","code":"P332_74709","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"\"With all their care, they had not understood the true spirit off the law\" (Schaff).

For in the judgment an opportunity is still given for defence; in the council, however, although there is also wont to be a judgment, yet because the very distinction compels us to acknowledge that there is a certain difference in this place, the production of the sentence seems to belong to the council, inasmuch as it is not now the case of the accused himself that is in question, whether he is to be condemned or not, but they who judge confer with one another to what punishment they ought to condemn him, who, it is clear, is to be condemned; but the gehenna of fire does not treat as a doubtful matter either the condemnation, like the judgment, or the punishment of him who is condemned, like the council; for in the gehenna of fire both the condemnation and the punishment of him who is condemned are certain. Thus there are seen certain degrees in the sins and in the liability to punishment;[fn-3-P339_82948:81-nf] but who can tell in what ways they are invisibly shown in the punishments of souls? We are therefore to learn how great the difference is between the righteousness ofthe Pharisees and that greater righteousness which introduces into the kingdom of heaven, because while it is a more serious crime to kill than to inflict reproach by means of a word, in the one case killing exposes one to the judgment, but in the other anger exposes one to the judgment, which is the least of those three sins; for in the former case they were discussing the question of murder among men, but in the latter all things are disposed of by means of a divine judgment, where the end of the condemned is the gehenna of fire.

Perhaps, therefore, we are enjoined to yield to God, and to be well-disposed towards Him, in order that we may be reconciled to Him, from whom by sinning we have turned away, so that He can be called our adversary. For He is rightly called the adversary of those whom He resists, for \"God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble;\"[fn-3-P373_98210:103-nf] and \"pride is the beginning of all sin, but the beginning of man's pride is to become apostate from God;\"[fn-3-P374_98335:104-nf] and the apostle says, \"For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.\"[fn-3-P375_98526:105-nf] And from this it may be perceived that no nature [as being] bad is an enemy to God, inasmuch as the very parties who were enemies are being reconciled. Whoever, therefore, while in this way, i.e. in this life, shall not have been reconciled to God by the death of His Son, will be delivered to the judge by Him, for \"the Father judgeth no man, but hath delivered all judgment to the Son;\" and so the other things which are described in this section follow, which we have already discussed. There is only one thing which creates a difficulty as regards this interpretation, viz. how it can be rightly said that we are in the way with God, if in this passage. He Himself is to be understood as the adversary of the wicked, with whom we are enjoined to be reconciled quickly; unless, perchance, because He is everywhere, we also, while we are in this way, are certainly with Him. For as it is said, \"If I ascend up into heaven, Thou art there; if I make my bed in hell, behold, Thou art there. If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; even there shall Thy hand lead me, and Thy right hand shall hold me.\"[fn-3-P376_99688:106-nf] Or if the view is not accepted, that the wicked are said to be with God, although there is nowhere where God is not present,-just as we do not say that the blind are with the light, although the light surrounds their eyes,-there is one resource remaining: that we should understand the adversary here as being the commandment of God. For what is so much an adversary to those who wish to sin as the commandment of God, i.e. His law and divine Scripture, which has been given us for this life, that it may be with us in the way, which we must not contradict, lest it deliver us to the judge, but which we ought to submit to quickly? For no one knows when he may depart out of this life. Now, who is it that submits to divine Scripture, save he who reads or hears it piously, deferring to it as of supreme authority; so that what he understands he does not hate on this account, that he feels it to be opposed to his sins, but rather loves being reproved by it, and rejoices that his maladies are not spared until they are healed; and so that even in respect to what seems to him obscure or absurd, he does not therefore raise contentious contradictions, but prays that he may understand, yet remembering that goodwill and reverence are to be manifested towards so great an authority? But who does this, unless just the man who has come, not harshly threatening, but in the meekness of piety, for the purpose of opening and ascertaining the contents of his father's will? \"Blessed,\" therefore, \"are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.\" Let us see what follows.","index":"69","references":[{"fn":"3","code":"P373_98210","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Jas. iv. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"james","chapter":4,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"3","code":"P374_98335","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Ecclus. x. 13, 12.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"3","code":"P375_98526","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Rom. v. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":5,"verses":[10]}]},{"fn":"3","code":"P376_99688","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Ps. cxxxix. 8-10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":139,"verses":[8]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter XII.","index":14,"paragraphs":[{"text":"33. \"Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: but I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.\" The lesser righteousness, therefore, is not to commit adultery by carnal connection; but the greater righteousness of the kingdom of God is not to commit adultery in the heart. Now, the man who does not commit adultery in the heart, much more easily guards against committing adultery in actual fact. Hence He who gave the later precept confirmed the earlier; for He came not to destroy the law, but to fulfil it.

For there are three things which go to complete sin: the suggestion of, the taking pleasure in, and the consenting to. Suggestion takes place either by means of memory, or by means of the bodily senses, when we see, or hear, or smell, or taste, or touch anything. And if it give us pleasure to enjoy this, this pleasure, if illicit, must be restrained. Just as when we are fasting, and on seeing food the appetite of the palate is stirred up, this does not happen without pleasure; but we do not consent to this liking, and[fn-3-P383_103081:109-nf] we repress it by the right of reason, which has the supremacy. But if consent shall take place, the sin will be complete, known to God in our heart, although it may not become known to men by deed. There are, then, these steps: the suggestion is made, as it were, by a serpent, that is to say, by a fleeting and rapid, i.e. a temporary, movement of bodies: for if there are also any such images moving about in the soul, they have been derived from without from the body; and if any hidden sensation of the body besides those five senses touches the soul, that also is temporary and fleeting; and therefore the more clandestinely it glides in, so as to affect the process of thinking, the more aptly is it compared to a serpent. Hence these three stages, as I was beginning to say, resemble that transaction which is described in Genesis, so that the suggestion and a certain measure of suasion is put forth, as it were, by the serpent; but the taking pleasure in it lies in the carnal appetite, as it were in Eve; and the consent lies in the reason, as it were in the man: and these things having been acted through, the man is driven forth, as it were, from paradise, i.e. from the most blessed light of righteousness, into death[fn-3-P384_104364:110-nf] -in all respects most righteously. For he who puts forth suasion does not compel. And all natures are beautiful in their order, according to their gradations; but we must not descend from the higher, among which the rational mind has its place assigned, to the lower. Nor is any one compelled to do this; and therefore, if he does it, he is punished by the just law of God, for he is not guilty of this unwillingly. But yet, previous to habit, either there is no pleasure, or it is so slight that there is hardly any; and to yield to it is a great sin, as such pleasure is unlawful. Now, when any one does yield, he commits sin in the heart. If, however, he also proceeds to action, the desire seems to be satisfied and extinguished; but afterwards, when the suggestion is repeated, a greater pleasure is kindled, which, however, is as yet much less than that which by continuous practice is converted into habit. For it is very difficult to overcome this; and yet even habit itself, if one does not prove untrue to himself, and does not shrink back in dread from the Christian warfare, he will get the better of under His (i.e. Christ's) leadership and assistance; and thus, in accordance with primitive peace and order, both the man is subject to Christ, and the woman is subject to the man.[fn-3-P385_105676:111-nf] ","index":"72","references":[{"fn":"3","code":"P383_103081","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"The reading \"if\" has been proposed by some.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"3","code":"P384_104364","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Gen. iii.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"3","code":"P385_105676","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"1 Cor. xi. 3 and Eph. v. 23.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":11,"verses":[3]},{"book":"ephesians","chapter":5,"verses":[23]}]}]},{"text":"35.

And as regards this inquiry, nothing occurs to me as a more suitable explanation than a greatly beloved friend: for this, certainly, is something which we may rightly call a member which we ardently love; and this friend a counsellor, for it is an eye, as it were, pointing out the road; and that in divine things, for it is the right eye: so that the left is indeed a beloved counsellor, but in earthly matters, pertaining to the necessities of the body; concerning which as a cause of stumbling it was superfluous to speak, inasmuch as not even the right was to be spared. Now, a counsellor in divine things is a cause of stumbling, if he endeavours to lead one into any dangerous heresy under the guise of religion and doctrine. Hence also let the right hand be taken in the sense of a beloved helper and assistant in divine works: for in like manner as contemplation is rightly understood as having its seat in the eye, so action in the right hand; so that the left hand may be understood in reference to works which are necessary for this life, and for the body.","index":"77","references":[{"fn":"4","code":"P402_110427","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Eat.

And, therefore, He who sought to interpose a delay in putting away, indicated as far as He could to hard-hearted men that He did not wish separation. And accordingly the Lord Himself in another passage, when a question was asked Him as to this matter, gave this reply: \"Moses did so because of the hardness of your hearts.\"[fn-4-P408_112903:125-nf] For however hard-hearted a man may be who wishes to put away his wife, when he reflects that, on a writing of divorcement being given her, she could then without risk marry another, he would be easily appeased. Our Lord, therefore, in order to confirm that principle, that a wife should not lightly be put away, made the single exception of fornication; but enjoins that all other annoyances, if any such should happen to spring up, be borne with fortitude for the sake of conjugal fidelity and for the sake of chastity; and he also calls that man an adulterer who should marry her that has been divorced by her husband. And the Apostle Paul shows the limit of this state of affairs, for he says it is to be observed as long as her husband liveth; but on the husband's death he gives permission to marry.[fn-4-P409_113729:126-nf] For he himself also held by this rule, and therein brings forward not his own advice, as in the case of some of his admonitions, but a commandby the Lord when he says: \"And unto the married[fn-4-P410_113942:127-nf] I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife[fn-4-P411_114052:128-nf] depart from her husband: but and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.\"[fn-4-P412_114260:129-nf] I believe that, according to a similar rule, if he shall put her away, he is to remain unmarried, or be reconciled to his wife. For it may happen that he puts away his wife for the cause of fornication, which our Lord wished to make an exception of. But now, if she is not allowed to marry while the husband is living from whom she has departed, nor he to take another while the wife is living whom he has put away, much less is it right to commit unlawful acts of fornication with any parties whomsoever. More blessed indeed are those marriages to be reckoned, where the parties concerned, whether after the procreation of children, or even through contempt of such an earthly progeny, have been able with common consent to practise self-restraint toward each other: both because nothing is done contrary to that precept whereby the Lord forbids a spouse to be put away (for he does not put her away who lives with her not carnally, but spiritually), and because that principle is observed to which the apostle gives expression, \"It remaineth, that they that have wives be as though they had none.\"[fn-4-P413_115387:130-nf] ","index":"79","references":[{"fn":"4","code":"P406_111944","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Per alias nuptias, quarum potestatem dat divortium (\"by another marriage, power of which divorce gives.\"-Bengel).

But if He were speaking with reference to sexual intercourse, He would not place father, and mother, and brothers in the same category. But how true it is, that \"the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and they that use violence take it by force!\"[fn-4-P418_116318:132-nf] For how great violence is necessary, in order that a man may love his enemies, and hate his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers!

And how these things do not contradict each other, it is easy to show under His guidance; but after they have been understood, it is difficult to carry them out, although this too is very easy when He Himself assists us. For in that eternal kingdom to which He has vouchsafed to call His disciples, to whom He also gives the name of brothers, there are no temporal relationships of this sort.

Here there arises a second question, when the Lord allows a wife to be put away for the cause of fornication, in what latitude of meaning fornication is to be understood in this passage,-whether in the sense understood by all, viz. that we are to understand that fornication to be meant which is committed in acts of uncleanness; or whether, in accordance with the usage of Scripture in speaking of fornication (as has been mentioned above), as meaning all unlawful corruption, such as idolatry or covetousness, and therefore, of course, every transgression of the law on account of the unlawful lust [involved in it].[fn-4-P431_122140:140-nf] But let us consult the apostle, that we may not say rashly. \"And unto the married I command,\" says he, \"yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband: but and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband.\" For it may happen that she departs for that cause for which the Lord gives permission to do so. Or, if a woman is at liberty to put away her husband for other causes besides that of fornication, and the husband is not at liberty, what answer shall we give respecting this statement which he has made afterwards, \"And let not the husband put away his wife \"? Wherefore did he not add, saving for the cause of fornication, which the Lord permits, unless because he wishes a similar rule to be understood, that if he shall put away his wife (which he is permitted to do for the cause of fornication), he is to remain without a wife, or be reconciled to his wife? For it would not be a bad thing for a husband to be reconciled to such a woman as that to whom, when nobody had dared to stone her, the Lord said, \"Go, and sin no more.\"[fn-4-P432_124012:141-nf] And for this reason also, because He who says, It is not lawful to putaway one's wife saving for the cause of fornication, forces him to retain his wife, if there should be no cause of fornication: but if there should be, He does not force him to put her away, but permits him, just as when it is said, Let it not be lawful for a woman to marry another, unless her husband be dead; if she shall marry before the death of her husband, she is guilty; if she shall not marry after the death of her husband, she is not guilty, for she is not commanded to marry, but merely permitted. If, therefore, there is a like rule in the said law of marriage between man and woman, to such an extent that not merely of the woman has the same apostle said, \"The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband;\" but he has not been silent respecting him, saying, \"And likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife;\"-if, then, the rule is similar, there is no necessity for understanding that it is lawful for a woman to put away her husband, saving for the cause of fornication, as is the case also with the husband.","index":"85","references":[{"fn":"4","code":"P431_122140","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Augustin expresses himself (Retract.

For thus he continues: \"If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.\" Hence, even now he is speaking to those who are married. What, then, is his object in saying \"to the rest,\" unless that he was speaking before to those who were so united, that they were alike as to their faith in Christ; but that now he is speaking to \"the rest,\" i.e. to those who are so united, that they are not both believers?

And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not put him away.\" If, therefore, he does not give a command as from the Lord, but advises as from himself, then this good result springs from it, that if any one act otherwise, he is not a transgressor of a command, just as he says a little after respecting virgins, that he has no command of the Lord, but that he gives his advice; and he so praises virginity, that whoever will may avail himself of it; yet if he shall not do so, he may not be judged to have acted contrary to a command.

Allowance is given[fn-4-P435_127683:143-nf] when it is said, \"But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.\" And therefore, if it is allowable that an unbelieving wife should be put away, although it is better not to put her away, and yet not allowable, according to the commandment of the Lord, that a wife should be put away, saving for the cause of fornication, [then] unbelief itself also is fornication.","index":"86","references":[{"fn":"4","code":"P434_127015","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Ignoscitur, lit. \"is pardoned.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"4","code":"P435_127683","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Lit. \"'it is pardoned.\"","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"45.

For this reason, viz. that the idolatry which unbelievers follow, and every other noxious superstition, is fornication. Now, the Lord permitted a wife to be put away for the cause of fornication; but in permitting, He did not command it: He gave opportunity to the apostle for advising that whoever wished should not put away an unbelieving wife, in order that, perchance, in this way she might become a believer. \"For,\" says he, \"the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother.\"[fn-4-P437_128974:144-nf] I suppose it had already occurred that some wives were embracing the faith by means of their believing husbands, and husbands by means of their believing wives; and although not mentioning names, he yet urged his case by examples, in order to strengthen his counsel.

Nothing, however, is more unjust than for a man to put away his wife because of fornication, if he himself also is convicted of committing fornication.

To this is to be added the consideration, that if he commits adultery by marryingher who is divorced from her husband (although she does not put away, but is put away), she causes him to commit adultery, which nevertheless the Lord forbids.

But yet it may be asked whether what the apostle says, \"The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband; and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife,\" can be carried so far, that, with the permission of a wife, who possesses the power over her husband's body, a man can have intercourse with another woman, who is neither another man's wife nor divorced from her husband; but such an opinion is not to be entertained, lest it should seem that a woman also, with her husband's permission, could do such a thing, which the instinctive feeling of every one prevents.","index":"91","references":[{"fn":"4","code":"P447_134581","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Abraham taking Hagar with Sarah's consent.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"50. And yet some occasions may arise, where a wife also, with the consent of her husband, may seem under obligation to do this for the sake of that husband himself; as, for instance, is said to have happened at Antioch about fifty years ago,[fn-4-P449_135823:151-nf] in the times of Constantius. For Acyndinus, at that time prefect and at one time also consul, when he demanded of a certain public debtor the payment of a poundweight of gold, impelled by I know not what motive, did a thing which is often dangerous in the case of those magistrates to whom anything whatever is lawful, or rather is thought to be lawful, viz. threatened with an oath and with a vehement affirmation, that if he did not pay the foresaid gold on a certain day which he had fixed, he would be put to death. Accordingly, while he was being kept in cruel confinement, and was unable to rid himself of that debt, the dread day began to impend and to draw near. He happened, however, to have a very beautiful wife, but one who had no money wherewith to come to the relief of her husband; and when a certain rich man had had his desires inflamed by the beauty of this woman, and had learned that her husband was placed in that critical situation, he sent to her, promising in return for a single night, if she would consent to hold intercourse with him, that he would give her the pound of gold. Then she, knowing that she herself had not power over her body, but her husband, conveyed the intelligence to him, telling him that she was prepared to do it for the sake of her husband, but only if he himself, the lord by marriage of her body, to whom all that chastity was due, should wish it to be done, as if disposing of his own property for the sake of his life. He thanked her, and commanded that it should be done, in no wise judging that it was an adulterous embrace, because it was no lust, but great love for her husband, that demanded it, at his own bidding and will. The woman came to the villa of that rich man, did what the lewd man wished; but she gave her body only to her husband, who desired not, as was usual, his marriage rights, but life. She received the gold; but he who gave it took away stealthily what he had given, and substituted a similar bag with earth in it. When the woman, however, on reaching her home, discovered it, she rushed forth in public in order to proclaim the deed she had done, animated by the same tender affection for her husband by which she had been forced to do it; she goes to the prefect, confesses everything, shows the fraud that had been practised upon her. Then indeed the prefect first pronounces himself guilty, because the matter had come to this by means of his threats, and, as if pronouncing sentence upon another, decided that a pound of gold should be brought into the treasury from the property of Acyndinus; but that she (the woman) be installed as mistress of that piece of land whence she had received the earth instead of the gold. I offer no opinion either way from this story: let each one form a judgment as he pleases, for the history is not drawn from divinely authoritative sources; but yet, when the story is related, man's instinctive sense does not so revolt against what was done in the case of this woman, at her husband's bidding, as we formerly shuddered when the thing itself was set forth without any example. But in this section of the Gospel nothing is to be more steadily kept in view, than that so great is the evil of fornication, that, while married people are bound to one another by so strong a bond, this one cause of divorce is excepted; but as to what fornication is, that we have already discussed.[fn-4-P450_139304:152-nf] ","index":"92","references":[{"fn":"4","code":"P449_135823","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"About the year 343; for Augustin wrote this treatise about the year 393.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"4","code":"P450_139304","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"The law permitted divorce for \"some uncleanness\" (Deut xxiv. 1). In the time of Christ divorce was allowed on trivial grounds. While Schammai interpreted the Deuteronomic prescription of moral uncleanness or adultery, Hillel interpreted it to include physical uncleanness or unattractiveness. A wife's cooking her husband's food unpalatably he declared to be a legitimate cause for dissolution of the marriage bond. Opposing the loose views current, Christ declared that it was on account of the \"hardness of their hearts\" that Moses had suffered them to put away their wives, and asserted adultery to be the only allowable reason for divorce. The question whether the innocent party may marry, is beset with great difficulties in view of this passage and Matt. xix. 9. The answer turns somewhat upon the construction of the passage. Augustin here, the Council of Trent (and so the Roman-Catholic Church), Weiss, Mansel, and others hold that all marriage of a divorced person is declared illegal. In another place (De Conj. Adult. i. 9) Augustin says, \"Why, I say, did the Lord interject `the cause of fornication,\f0' and not say rather, in a general way, `Whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another commits adultery\f0'?...I think, because the Lord wishes to mention that which is greater. For who will deny that it is a greater adultery to marry another when the divorced wife has not committed fornication than when any one divorces his wife and then marries another? Not because this is not adultery, but because it is a lesser sort.\" The Apost. Constitutions (vii. 2) say, \"Thou shalt not commit adultery, for thou dividest one flesh into two,\" etc. Weiss: \"Jesus everywhere takes it for granted that in the sight of God there is no such thing as a dissolution of the marriage bond\" (Leben Jesu, i. 529). President Woolsey, on the other hand, unhesitatingly declares, that, by Christ's precepts, marriage is dissolved by adultery, so that the innocent party may marry again. According to this passage, the woman divorced on other grounds than adultery seems to be declared adulterous if she marry. According to Matt. xix. 9 the man who puts away his wife for adultery, seems to be permitted to marry without becoming adulterous himself. According to Mark x. 12 the woman had the privilege in that day of putting away her husband, but \"there is no evidence in the Hebrew Scriptures that the woman could get herself divorced from her husband.\" To the able treatment of Augustin, which might seem either exceedingly fearless or mawkish at the present day, according to the stand-point of the critic, the reader would do well to read Alford and Lange on this passage; Stanley on I Cor. vii. 11; and Woolsey, art. \"Divorce\" in Scaff-Herzog Encycl. Whatever may be the exact meaning of our Lord concerning the marriage of the innocent party, it is evident that He regards the marriage bond as profoundly sacred, and warrants the celebrant in binding the parties to marriage to be faithful one to the other \"till death do you part.\" He Himself said, \"What, therefore, God hath joined together, let not man put asunder\" (Mark x. 9).","bible_refs":[{"book":"deuteronomy","chapter":24,"verses":[1]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":19,"verses":[9]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":19,"verses":[9]},{"book":"mark","chapter":10,"verses":[12]},{"book":"mark","chapter":10,"verses":[9]},{"book":"deuteronomy","chapter":24,"verses":[1]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":19,"verses":[9]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":19,"verses":[9]},{"book":"mark","chapter":10,"verses":[12]},{"book":"mark","chapter":10,"verses":[9]},{"book":"deuteronomy","chapter":24,"verses":[1]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":19,"verses":[9]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":19,"verses":[9]},{"book":"mark","chapter":10,"verses":[12]},{"book":"mark","chapter":10,"verses":[9]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter XVII.","index":19,"paragraphs":[{"text":"51. \"Again,\" says He, \"ye have heard that it hath been said to them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oath:[fn-4-P454_142618:153-nf] But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven, for it is God's throne; nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.

But yet, since he who takes God to witness swears, this section must be carefully considered, lest the apostle should seem to have acted contrary to the Lord's precept, who often swore in this way, when he says, \"Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God I lie not;\"[fn-4-P456_143686:155-nf] and again, \"The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.\"[fn-4-P457_143818:156-nf] Of like nature also is that asseveration, \"For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of His Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers.\"[fn-4-P458_144026:157-nf] Unless, perchance, one were to say that it is to be reckoned swearing only when something is spoken of by which one swears; so that he has not used an oath, because he has not said, by God; but has said, \"God is witness.\" It is ridiculous to think so; yet because of the contentious, or those very slow of apprehension, lest any one should think there is a difference, let him know that the apostle has used an oath in this way also, saying, \"By your rejoicing, I die daily.\"[fn-4-P459_144520:158-nf] And let no one think that this is so expressed as if it were said, Your rejoicing makes me die daily; just as it is said, By his teaching he became learned, i.e. by his teaching it came about that he was perfectly instructed:the Greek copies decide the matter, where we find it written, Nh thn kauxhsin umeteran, an expression which is used only by one taking an oath. Thus, then, it is understood that the Lordgave the command not to swear in this sense, lest any one should eagerly seek after an oath as a good thing, and by the constant use of oaths sink down through force of habit into perjury. And therefore let him who understands that swearing is to be reckoned not among things that are good, but among things that are necessary, refrain as far as he can from indulgingin it, unless by necessity, when he sees men slow to believe what it is useful for them to believe,except they be assured by an oath. To this, accordingly, reference is made when it is said, \"Let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay;\" this is good, and what is to be desired. \"For whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil;\" i.e., if you are compelled to swear, know that it comes of a necessity arising from the infirmity of those whom you are trying to persuade of something; which infirmity is certainly an evil, from which we daily pray to be delivered, when we say, \"Deliver us from evil.\"[fn-4-P460_145916:159-nf] Hence He has not said, Whatsoever is more than these is evil; for you are not doing what is evil when you make a good use of an oath, which, although not in itself good, is yet necessary in order to persuade another that you are trying to move him for some useful end; but it \"cometh of evil\" on his part by whose infirmity you are compelled to swear.[fn-4-P461_146289:160-nf] But no one learns, unless he has had experience, how difficult it is both to get rid of a habit of swearing, and never to do rashly what necessity sometimes compels him to do.[fn-4-P462_146701:161-nf] ","index":"94","references":[{"fn":"4","code":"P454_142618","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Jusjurandum; Vulgate, juramenta; Greek, tou= o_rkouj.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"4","code":"P455_143027","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Amplius; Vulgate, abundantius.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"4","code":"P456_143686","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Gal. i. 20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"galatians","chapter":1,"verses":[20]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P457_143818","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"2 Cor. xi. 31.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":11,"verses":[31]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P458_144026","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Rom. i. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":1,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P459_144520","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"1 Cor. xv. 31.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":15,"verses":[31]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P460_145916","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Matt. vi. 13.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":6,"verses":[13]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P461_146289","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Revised Version, Evil One.

The oath was permitted by the law (Lev. xxii. 11), was to be held sacred (Num. xxx. 2), and to be made in God's name (Deut. vi. 13). It was customary under the Old Testament to swear (Gen. xxiv. 37, Josh. ix. 15; perhaps only a solemn affirmation), and in the name of the Lord (1 Sam. xx. 42; Irenaeus, Clement, Origen, Chrysostom, etc.). The Anabaptists, Mennonites, and Quakers understand the precept to forbid all oaths, even in the civil court. \"Christendom, if it were fully conformed to Christ's will, as it should be, would tolerate no oaths whatever\" (Meyer). \"The proper state of Christians is to require no oaths\" (Alford). If interpreted as a definite prohibition of all swearing, the passage comes into conflict with Christ's own example (Matt. xxvi. 63), and the apostle's conduct in the passages quoted by Augustin. The meaning has been restricted to rash and frivolous oaths on the street and in the market (Keim); in daily conversation (Carr, Camb. Bible for Schools). In the ideal Christian community, where truth and honesty prevail, oaths will be superfluous: the simple asseverations, \"Yea, nay,\" will be sufficient. To this, Christ's precept ultimately looks. But He, no doubt, had in mind the widespread profanity of His day, and the current opinion that only oaths containing the name of God were binding (Lightfoot cites from the Rabbinical books to this effect). All unnecessary appeals to God, as well as careless and profane swearing, are forbidden, as coming either from bad passions within or a want of reverence. \"Prohibition would be repeal of the Mosaic law\" (Plumptre). \"All strengthening of the simple `Yea and nay\f0' is occasioned by the presence of sin and Satan in the world. There is no more striking proof of the existence of evil than the prevalence of the foolish, low, useless habit of swearing. It could never have arisen if men did not believe each other to be liars,\" etc. (Schaff). \"Men use their protestations because they are distrustful one of another. An oath is physic, which supposes disease\" (M. Henry). When the oath is performed for the \"sake of ethical interests, as when the civil authority demands it,\" as seems to be necessary and safe for society in its present unsanctified condition, the precept does not interfere (KÃ¶stlin, art. \"Oath,\" Schaff-Herzog Encyl., Meyer, Wuttke, Alford, Tholuck, etc.). An interesting imitation of the Rabbinical casuistry above referred to was practised by the crafty and subtle Louis XI. Scott says (Introd. to Quentin Durward), \"He admitted to one or two peculiar forms of oath the force of a binding obligation which he denied to all others, strictly preserving the secret; which mode of swearing he really accounted obligatory, as one of the most valuable of State secrets.\"","bible_refs":[{"book":"leviticus","chapter":22,"verses":[11]},{"book":"numbers","chapter":30,"verses":[2]},{"book":"deuteronomy","chapter":6,"verses":[13]},{"book":"genesis","chapter":24,"verses":[37]},{"book":"joshua","chapter":9,"verses":[15]},{"book":"1 samuel","chapter":20,"verses":[42]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":26,"verses":[63]},{"book":"leviticus","chapter":22,"verses":[11]},{"book":"numbers","chapter":30,"verses":[2]},{"book":"deuteronomy","chapter":6,"verses":[13]},{"book":"genesis","chapter":24,"verses":[37]},{"book":"joshua","chapter":9,"verses":[15]},{"book":"1 samuel","chapter":20,"verses":[42]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":26,"verses":[63]},{"book":"leviticus","chapter":22,"verses":[11]},{"book":"numbers","chapter":30,"verses":[2]},{"book":"deuteronomy","chapter":6,"verses":[13]},{"book":"genesis","chapter":24,"verses":[37]},{"book":"joshua","chapter":9,"verses":[15]},{"book":"1 samuel","chapter":20,"verses":[42]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":26,"verses":[63]},{"book":"leviticus","chapter":22,"verses":[11]},{"book":"numbers","chapter":30,"verses":[2]},{"book":"deuteronomy","chapter":6,"verses":[13]},{"book":"genesis","chapter":24,"verses":[37]},{"book":"joshua","chapter":9,"verses":[15]},{"book":"1 samuel","chapter":20,"verses":[42]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":26,"verses":[63]},{"book":"leviticus","chapter":22,"verses":[11]},{"book":"numbers","chapter":30,"verses":[2]},{"book":"deuteronomy","chapter":6,"verses":[13]},{"book":"genesis","chapter":24,"verses":[37]},{"book":"joshua","chapter":9,"verses":[15]},{"book":"1 samuel","chapter":20,"verses":[42]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":26,"verses":[63]}]}]},{"text":"52. But it may be asked why, when it was said, \"But I say unto you, Swear not at all,\" it was added, \"neither by heaven, for it is God's throne,\" etc., up to \"neither by thy head.\" I suppose it was for this reason, that the Jews did not think they were bound by the oath, if they had sworn by such things: and since they had heard it said, \"Thou shalt perform unto the Lord thine oath,\" they did not think an oath brought them under obligation to the Lord, if they swore by heaven, or earth, or by Jerusalem, or by their head; and this happened not from the fault of Him who gave the command, but because they did not rightly understand it. Hence the Lord teaches that there is nothing so worthless among the creatures of God, as that any one should think that he may swear falsely by it; since created things, from the highest down to the lowest, beginning with the throne of God and going down to a white or black hair, are ruled by divine providence. \"Neither by heaven,\" says He, \"for it is God's throne; nor by the earth, for it is His footstool:\" i.e., when you swear by heaven or the earth, do not imagine that your oath does not bring you under obligation to the Lord; for you are convicted of swearing by Him who has heaven for His throne, and the earth for His footstool. \"Neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King;\" a better expression than if He had said, \"My [city]; although, however, we understand Him to have meant this. And, because He is undoubtedly the Lord, the man who swears by Jerusalem is bound by his oath to the Lord. \"Neither shall thou swear by thy head.\" Now, what could any one suppose to belong more to himself than his own head? But how is it ours, when we have not the power of making one hair white or black? Hence, whoever should wish to swear even by his own head, is bound by his oath to God, who in an ineffable way keeps all things in His power, and is everywhere present.

Let such an one cut off the members which obstruct the kingdom of heaven, and not be overwhelmed by the pain: in conjugal fidelity let him bear with everything which, however grievously annoying it may be, is still free from the guilt of unlawful corruption, i.e. of fornication: as, for instance, if any one should have a wife either barren, or misshapen in body, or faulty in her members,-either blind, or deaf, or lame, or having any other defect,-or worn out by diseases and pains and weaknesses, and whatever else may be thought of exceeding horrible, fornication excepted, let him endure it for the sake of his plighted love and conjugal union;[fn-4-P470_153887:164-nf] and let him not only not put away such a wife, but even if he have her not, let him not marry one who has been divorced by her husband, though beautiful, healthy, rich, fruitful.

Let him speak the truth, and let him commend it not by frequent oaths, but by the probity of his morals; and with respect to the innumerable crowds of all bad habits rising up in rebellion against him, of which, in order that all may be understood, a few have been mentioned, let him betake himself to the citadel of Christian warfare, and let him lay them prostrate, as if from a higher ground.

For it is not easy to find any one who, when he has received a blow, wishes merely to return the blow; and who, on hearing one word from a man who reviles him, is content to return only one, and that just an equivalent; but he avenges it more immoderately, either under the disturbing influence of anger, or because he thinks it just, that he who first inflicted injury should suffer more severe injury than he suffered who had not inflicted injury.

Hence, between that first course which goes beyond the law, that a greater evil should be inflicted in return for a lesser, and this to which the Lord has given expression for the purpose of perfecting the disciples, that no evil at all should be inflicted in return for evil, a middle course holds a certain place, viz. that as much be paid back as has been received; by means of which enactment the transition is made from the highest discord to the highest concord, according to the distribution of times. See, therefore, at how great a distance any one who is the first to do harm to another, with the desire of injuring and hurting him, stands from him who, even when injured, does not pay back the injury. That man, however, who is not the first to do harm to any one, but who yet, when injured, inflicts a greater injury in return, either in will or in deed, has so far withdrawn himself from the highest injustice, and made so far an advance to the highest righteousness; but still he does not yet hold by what the law given by Moses commanded. And therefore he who pays back just as much as he has received already forgives something: for the party who injures does not deserve merely as much punishment as the man who was injured by him has innocently suffered. And accordingly this incomplete, by no means severe, but [rather] merciful justice, is carried to perfection by Him who came to fulfil the law, not to destroy it. Hence there are still two intervening steps which He has left to be understood, while He has chosen rather to speak of the very highest development of mercy. For there is still what one may do who does not come fully up to that magnitude of the precept which belongs to the kingdom of heaven; acting in such a way that he does not pay back as much, but less; as, for instance, one blow instead of two, or that he cuts off an ear for an eye that has been plucked out. He who, rising above this, pays back nothing at all, approaches the Lord's precept, but yet he does not reach it. For still it seems to the Lord not enough, if, for the evil which you may have received, you should inflict no evil in return, unless you be prepared to receive even more. And therefore He does not say, \"But I say unto you,\" that you are not to return evil for evil; although even this would be a great precept: but He says, \"that ye resist not evil;\"[fn-4-P479_160415:168-nf] so that not only are you not to pay back what may have been inflicted on you, but you are not even to resist other inflictions. For this is what He also goes on to explain: \"But whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also:\" for He does not say, If any man smite thee, do not wish to smite him; but, Offer thyself further to him if he should go on to smite thee. As regards compassion, they feel it most who minister to those whom they greatly love as if they were their children, or some very dear friends in sickness, or little children, or insane persons, at whose hands they often endure many things; and if their welfare demand it, they even show themselves ready to endure more, until the weakness either of age or of disease pass away. And so, as regards those whom the Lord, the Physician of souls, was instructing to take care of their neighbours, what else could He teach them, than that they endure quietly the infirmities of those whose welfare they wish to consult?

But it may be asked what the right cheek means. For this is the reading we find in the Greek copies, which are most worthy of confidence; though many Latin ones have only the word \"cheek,\" without the addition of \"right.\" Now the face is that by which any one is recognised; and we read in the apostle's writings, \"For ye suffer,[fn-4-P482_162321:170-nf] if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face:\" then immediately he adds, \"I speak as concerning reproach;\"[fn-4-P483_162553:171-nf] so that he explains what striking on the face is, viz. to be contemned and despised. Nor is this indeed said by the apostle for this reason, that they should not bear with those parties; but that they should bear with himself rather, who so loved them, that he was willing that he himself should be spent for them.[fn-4-P484_162894:172-nf] But since the face cannot be called right and left, and yet there may be a worth according to the estimate of God and according to the estimate of this world, it is so distributed as it were into the right and left cheek that whatever disciple of Christ might have to bear reproach for being a Christian, he should be much more ready to bear reproach in himself, if he possesses any of the honours of this world. Thus this same apostle, if he had kept silence respecting the dignity which he had in the world, when men were persecuting in him the Christian name, would not have presented the other cheek to those that were smiting the right one. For when he said, I am a Roman citizen,[fn-4-P485_163603:173-nf] he was not unprepared to submit to be despised, in that which he reckoned as least, by those who had despised in him so precious and life-giving a name. For did he at all the less on that account afterwards submit to the chains, which it was not lawful to put on Roman citizens, or did lie wish to accuse any one of this injury? And if any spared him on account of the name of Roman citizenship, yet he did not on that account refrain from offering an object they might strike at, since he wished by his patience to cure of so great perversity those whom he saw honouring in him what belonged to the left members rather than the right. For that point only is to be attended to, in what spirit he did everything, how benevolently and mildly he acted toward those from whom he was suffering such things. For when he was smitten with the hand by order of the high priest, what he seemed to say contumeliously when he affirms, \"God shall smite thee, thou whited wall,\" sounds like an insult to those who do not understand it; but to those who do, it is a prophecy. For a whited wall is hypocrisy, i.e. pretence holding forth the sacerdotal dignity before itself, and under this name, as under a white covering, concealing an inner and as it were sordid baseness. For what belonged to humility he wonderfully preserved, when, on its being said to him, \"Revilest thou the high priest?\"[fn-4-P486_165006:174-nf] he replied, \"I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest; for it is written, Thou shall not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.\"[fn-4-P487_165201:175-nf] And here he showed with what calmness he had spoken that which he seemed to have spoken in anger, because he answered so quickly and so mildly, which cannot be done by those who are indignant and thrown into confusion. And in that very statement he spoke the truth to those who understood him, \"I wist not that he was the high priest:\"[fn-4-P488_165561:176-nf] as if he said, I know another High Priest, for whose name I bear such things, whom it is not lawful to revile, and whom ye revile, since in me it is nothing else but His name that ye hate. Thus, therefore, it is necessary for one not to boast of such things in a hypocritical way, but to be prepared in the heart itself for all things, so that he can sing that prophetic word, \"My heart is prepared,[fn-4-P489_166115:177-nf] O God, my heart is prepared.\" For many have learned how to offer the other cheek, but do not know how to love him by whom they are struck. But in truth, the Lord Himself, who certainly was the first to fulfil the precepts which He taught, did not offer the other cheek to the servant of the high priest when smiting Him thereon; but, so far from that, said, \"If I have spoken evil, hear witness of the evil;[fn-4-P490_166568:178-nf] but if well, why smitest thou me?\"[fn-4-P491_166666:179-nf] Yet was He not on that account unprepared in heart, for the salvation of all, not merely to be smitten on the other cheek, but even to have His whole body crucified.","index":"103","references":[{"fn":"4","code":"P482_162321","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Toleratis; Vulgate, sustinetis.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"4","code":"P483_162553","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"2 Cor. xi. 20, 21.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":11,"verses":[20]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P484_162894","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"2 Cor. xii. 15.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":12,"verses":[15]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P485_163603","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Acts xxii. 25.","bible_refs":[{"book":"the acts","chapter":22,"verses":[25]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P486_165006","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Principi sacerdotum; Vulgate, summum sacerdotem.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"4","code":"P487_165201","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Acts xxiii. 3-5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"the acts","chapter":23,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P488_165561","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Interpreted by modern commentators usually of temporary forgetfulness, or, what is much better, failure to recognise through infirmity of vision.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"4","code":"P489_166115","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"English version, \"fixed\"-Ps. lvii. 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":57,"verses":[7]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P490_166568","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Exprobra de malo; Vulgate, testimonium perhibe de malo.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"4","code":"P491_166666","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"John xviii. 23.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":18,"verses":[23]}]}]},{"text":"59.

But what is said with respect to the coat and cloak is to be carried out not merely in such things, but in the case of everything which on any ground of right we speak of as being ours for time. For if this command is given with respect to what is necessary, how much more does it become us to contemn what is superfluous! But still, those things which I have called ours are to be included in that category under which the Lord Himself gives the precept, when He says, \"If any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat.\" Let all these things therefore be understood for which we may be sued at the law, so that the right to them may pass from us to him who sues, or for whom he sues; such, for instance, as clothing, a house, an estate, a beast of burden, and in general all kinds of property. But whether it is to be understood of slaves also is a great question. For a Christian ought not to possess a slave in the same way as a horse or money: although it may happen that a horse is valued at a greater price than a slave, and some article of gold or silver at much more. But with respect to that slave, if he is being educated and ruled by time as his master, in a way more upright, and more honourable, and more conducing to the fear of God, than can be done by him who desires to take him away, I do not know whether any one would dare to say that he ought to be despised like a garment.

And therefore I think it is so expressed, \"And if any one will sue thee at the law, and take away thy tunic, let him have thy garment also,\" as if He had said, Whoever wishes to take away thy tunic, give over to him whatever other clothing thou hast.

For in the Christian history itself, which is authoritative, you will find no such thing done by the saints, or by the Lord Himself when in His human nature, which He condescended to assume, He was showing us an example of how to live; while at the same time, in almost all places, you will find them prepared to bear with equanimity whatever may have been wickedly forced upon them. But are we to suppose it is said for the sake of the mere expression, \"Go with him other two;\" or did He rather wish that three should be completed,-the number which has the meaning of perfection; so that every one should remember when he does this, that he is fulfilling perfect righteousness by compassionately bearing the infirmities of those whom he wishes to be made whole? It may seem for this reason also that He has recommended these precepts by three examples: of which the first is, if any one shall smite thee on the cheek; the second, if any one shall wish to take away thy coat; the third, if any one shall compel thee to go a mile: in which third example twice as much is added to the original unit, so that in this way the triplet is completed. And if this number in the passage before us does not, as has been said, mean perfection, let this be understood, that in laying down His precepts, as it were beginning with what is more tolerable, He has gradually gone on, until He has reached as far as the enduring of twice as much more. For, in the first place, He wished the other cheek to be presented when the right had been smitten, so that you may be prepared to bear less than you have borne. For whatever the right means, it is at least something more dear than that which is meant by the left; and if one who has borne with something in what is more dear, bears with it in what is less dear, it is something less. Then, secondly, in the case of one who wishes to take away a coat, He enjoins that the garment also should be given up to him: which is either just as much, or not much more; not, however, twice as much. In the third place, with respect to the mile, to which He says that two miles are to be added, He enjoins that you should bear with even twice as much more: thus signifying that whether it be somewhat less than the original demand, or just as much, or more, that any wicked man shall wish to take from thee, it is to be borne with tranquil mind.","index":"106","references":[{"fn":"4","code":"P498_169380","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"The Greek word a0ggareu/w is derived from the Persian, to press one into service, as a courier to bear despatches.

Is that part of the body which was injured for that reason restored to its original condition? But an excited mind desires such alleviations.

They did not judge rashly on whom God had bestowed such a power of judging.

Hence, in this class of injuries which is atoned for by punishment, such a measure will be preserved by Christians, that, on an injury being received, the mind will not mount up into hatred, but will be ready, in compassion for the infirmity, to endure even more; nor will it neglect the correction, which it can employ either by advice, or by authority, or by [the exercise of] power. There is another class of injuries, where complete restitution is possible, of which there are two species: the one referring to money, the other to labour.

Yet that one is plainest which the apostle thus states: \"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother.\"[fn-5-P547_192757:214-nf] For he has not added the word our; but has thought it plain, as he wished a Christian who had an unbelieving wife to be understood by the expression brother. And therefore he says a little after, \"But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart: a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases.\"[fn-5-P548_193079:215-nf] Hence I am of opinion that the sin of a brother is unto death, when any one, after coming to the knowledge of God through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, makes an assault on the brotherhood, and is impelled by the fires of envy to oppose that grace itself by which he is reconciled to God. But the sin is not unto death, if any one has not withdrawn his love from a brother, but through some infirmity of disposition has failed to perform the incumbent duties of brotherhood. And on this accountour Lord also on the cross says, \"Father, forgive[fn-5-P549_193655:216-nf] them; for they know not what they do:\"[fn-5-P550_193728:217-nf] for, not yet having become partakers of thegrace of the Holy Spirit, they had not yet entered the fellowship of the holy brotherhood. And the blessed Stephen in the Acts of the Apostles prays for those by whom he is being stoned,[fn-5-P551_193982:218-nf] because they had not yet believed on Christ, and were not fighting against that common grace. And the Apostle Paul on this account, I believe, does not pray for Alexander, because he was already a brother, and had sinned unto death, viz. by making an assault on the brotherhood through envy. But for those who had not broken off their love, but had given way through fear, he prays that they may bepardoned. For thus he expresses it: \"Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord will reward him according to his works. Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatlywithstood our words.\"[fn-5-P552_194599:219-nf] Then he adds for whom he prays, thus expressing it: \"At my first defence no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.\"[fn-5-P553_194807:220-nf] ","index":"121","references":[{"fn":"5","code":"P546_192159","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"1 John v. 16.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 john","chapter":5,"verses":[16]}]},{"fn":"5","code":"P547_192757","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"See note p.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"5","code":"P548_193079","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"1 Cor. vii. 14, 15.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":7,"verses":[14]}]},{"fn":"5","code":"P549_193655","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Ignosce; Vulgate, dimitte.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"5","code":"P550_193728","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Luke xxiii. 34.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":23,"verses":[34]}]},{"fn":"5","code":"P551_193982","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Acts vii. 60.","bible_refs":[{"book":"the acts","chapter":7,"verses":[60]}]},{"fn":"5","code":"P552_194599","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Sermonibus; Vulgate, verbis.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"5","code":"P553_194807","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"2 Tim. iv. 14-16.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 timothy","chapter":4,"verses":[14]}]}]},{"text":"74. It is this difference in their sins which separates Judas the betrayer from Peter the denier: not that a penitent is not to be pardoned, for we must not come into collision with that declaration of our Lord, where He enjoins that a brother is to be pardoned, when he asks his brother to pardon him;[fn-5-P555_195135:221-nf] but that the ruin connected with that sin is so great, that he cannot endure the humiliation of asking for it, even if he should be compelled by a bad conscience both to acknowledge and divulge his sin. For when Judas had said, \"I have sinned, in that I have betrayed the innocent blood,\" yet it was easier for him in despair to run and hang himself,[fn-5-P556_195524:222-nf] than in humility to ask for pardon. And therefore it is of much consequence to know what sort of repentance God pardons. For many much more readily confess that they have sinned, and are so angry with themselves that they vehemently wish they had not sinned; but yet they do not condescend to humble the heart and to make it contrite, and to implore pardon: and this disposition of mind we must suppose them to have, as feeling themselves already condemned because of the greatness of their sin.","index":"122","references":[{"fn":"5","code":"P555_195135","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Matt. xviii. 21.

And this is perhaps the sin against the Holy Ghost, i.e. through malice and envy to act in opposition to brotherly love after receiving the grace of the Holy Ghost,-a sin which our Lord says is not forgiven either in this world or in the world to come. And hence it may be asked whether the Jews sinned against the Holy Ghost, when they said that our Lord was casting out devils by Beelzebub, the prince of the devils: whether we are to understand this as said against our Lord Himself, because He says of Himself in another passage, \"If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebub, how muchmore shall they call them of His household!\"[fn-5-P558_196692:223-nf] or whether, inasmuch as they had spoken from great envy, being ungrateful for so manifest benefits, although they were not yet Christians, theyare, from the very greatness of their envy, to be supposed to have sinned against the Holy Ghost? This latter is certainly not to be gathered from our Lord's words. For although He has said in the same passage, \"And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever speaketh a word against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come;\" yet it may seem that He admonished them for this purpose, that they should come to His grace, and after accepting of it should not so sin as they have now sinned. For now they have spoken a word against the Son of man, and it may be forgiven them, if they be converted, and believe on Him, and receive the Holy Ghost; but if, after receiving Him, they should choose to envy the brotherhood, and to assail the grace they have received, it cannot be forgiven them, neither in this world nor in the world to come. For if He reckoned them so condemned, that there was no hope left for them, He would not judge that they ought still to be admonished, as He did by adding the statement, \"Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt.\"[fn-5-P559_198069:224-nf] ","index":"123","references":[{"fn":"5","code":"P558_196692","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Matt. x. 25.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":10,"verses":[25]}]},{"fn":"5","code":"P559_198069","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Matt. xii. 24-33.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":12,"verses":[24]}]}]},{"text":"76.

But what are we to think respecting those parties against whom we have it revealed that prayers were offered by the saints, not that they might be turned from their error (for in this way prayer is offered rather for them), but that final condemnation might come upon them: not as it was offered against the betrayer of our Lord by the prophet; for that, as has been said, was a prediction of things to come, not a wish for punishment: nor as it was offered by the apostle against Alexander; for respecting that also enough has been already said: but as we read in the Apocalypse of John of the martyrs praying that they may be avenged;[fn-5-P562_199741:226-nf] while the well-known first martyr prayed that those who stoned him should be pardoned.","index":"124","references":[{"fn":"5","code":"P561_198731","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Rom. xii. 14, 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":12,"verses":[14]}]},{"fn":"5","code":"P562_199741","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Rev. vi. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"revelation","chapter":6,"verses":[10]}]}]},{"text":"77. But we need not be moved by this circumstance. For who would venture to affirm, in regard to those white-robed saints, when they pleaded that they should be avenged, whether they pleaded against the men themselves or against the dominion of sin? For of itself it is a genuine avenging of the martyrs, and one full of righteousness and mercy, that the dominion of sin should be overthrown, under which dominion they were subjected to so great sufferings. And for its overthrow the apostle strives, saying, \"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body.\"[fn-5-P564_200407:227-nf] But the dominion of sin is destroyed and overthrown, partly by the amendment of men, so that the flesh is brought under subjection to the spirit; partly by the condemnation of those who persevere in sin, so that they are righteously disposed of in such a way that they cannot be troublesome to the righteous who reign with Christ. Look at the Apostle Paul; does it not seem to you that he avenges the martyr Stephen in his own person, when he says: \"So fight I, not as one that beateth the air: but I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection\"?[fn-5-P565_200979:228-nf] For he was certainly laying prostrate, and weakening, and bringing into subjection, and regulating that principle in himself whence he had persecuted Stephen and the other Christians. Who then can demonstrate that the holy martyrs were not asking from the Lord such an avenging of themselves, when at the same time, in order to their being avenged, they might lawfully wish for the end of this world, in which they had endured such martyrdoms? And they who pray for this, on the one hand pray for their enemies who are curable, and on the other hand do not pray against those who have chosen to be incurable: because God also, in punishing them, is not a malevolent Torturer, but a most righteous Disposer.
