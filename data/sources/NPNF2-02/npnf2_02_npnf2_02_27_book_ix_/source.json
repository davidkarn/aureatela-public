The Divine Power which is the guardian of the universe,\nforesaw that the emperor would be distinguished by his piety, and therefore determined that\nPulcheria, his sister, should be the protector of him and of his government. This princess was not\nyet fifteen years of age, but had received a mind most wise and divine above her years. She first\ndevoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters in the same course of life. To avoid all\ncause of jealousy and intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her\nresolution, she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses to her\nself-dedication. In token of her virginity and the headship of her brother, she consecrated in the\nchurch of Constantinople, a holy table, a remarkable fabric and very beautiful to see; it was made of\ngold and precious stones; and she inscribed these things on the front of the table, so that it might\nbe patent to all. After quietly resuming the care of the state, she governed the Roman empire\nexcellently and with great orderliness; she concerted her measures so well that the affairs to be\ncarried out were quickly decreed and completed. She was able to write and to converse with perfect\naccuracy in the Greek and Latin languages. She caused all affairs to be transacted in the name of her\nbrother, and devoted great attention to bringing him up as a prince in the best possible way and with\nsuch information as was suitable to his years. She had him taught by the most skilled men, in\nhorsemanship, and the practice of arms, and in letters. But he was systematically taught by his\nsister to be orderly and princely in his manners; she showed him how to gather up his robes, and how\nto take a seat, and how to walk; she trained him to restrain laughter, to assume a mild or a\nformidable aspect as the occasion might require, and to inquire with urbanity into the cases of those\nwho came before him with petitions. But she strove chiefly, to lead him into piety, and to pray\ncontinuously; she taught him to frequent the church regularly, and to honor the houses of prayer with\ngifts and treasures; and she inspired him with reverence for priests and other good men, and for\nthose who, in accordance with the law of Christianity, had devoted themselves to philosophy. She\nprovided zealously and wisely that religion might not be endangered by the innovation of spurious\ndogmas. That new heresies have not prevailed in our times, we shah find to be due especially to her,\nas we shall subsequently see. With how much fear she worshiped God, it would take long for any one to\nsay; and how many houses of prayer she built magnificently, and how many hostelries and monastic\ncommunities she established, the arrangement for the expenses for their perpetual support, and the\nprovision for the inmates. If any one pleases to examine the truth from the business itself, and not\nto be convinced by my words, he will learn that they are not falsely described by me for my own\nfavor, if he will investigate the testimonial documents written up by the stewards of her house, and\nif he will inquire from the true records whether the facts agree with my history. If these proofs\nalone do not satisfy him so as to make him believe, let God himself persuade him who had her in favor\naltogether and everywhere on account of her conduct, so that He heard her prayer readily, and\nfrequently directed beforehand the things which ought to be done. Suchindications of Divine love are\nnot conferred upon men unless they have merited them by their works. But I willingly pass over for\nthe present the many separate manifestations of Divine favor that were granted to the sister of the\nemperor as proofs that she was loved of God, lest anybody should blame me for having set out to do\nother things, and yet had turned to the use of encomiums. One incident relating to her seems,\nhowever, so fitting in itself and to my ecclesiastical history, and so evident a demonstration of her\nlove for God, that I will relate it here, although it happened some time afterwards. It is as\nfollows:-","index":"21","references":[]}]},{"name":"Chapter II.-Discovery of the Relics of Forty Holy Martyrs.","index":4,"paragraphs":[{"text":"A Woman by name Eusebia,[fn-46-P4658_2131494:2-nf] who was a\ndeaconess of the Macedonian sect, had a house and garden without the walls of Constantinople, in\nwhich she kept the holy remains of forty soldiers,[fn-46-P4659_2131684:3-nf] who had suffered martyrdom under Licinius at\nSebaste in Armenia. When she felt death approaching, she bequeathed the aforesaid place to some\northodox monks, and bound them by oath to bury her there, and to hew out separately a place above her\nhead at the top of her coffin, and to deposit the relics of the martyrs with her, and to inform no\none. The monks did so; but in order to render due honor to the martyrs secretly, according to the\nagreement with Eusebia, they formed a subterranean house of prayer near her tomb. But open to view,\nan edifice was erected above the foundation, inclosed with baked bricks, and a secret descent from it\nto the martyrs. Soon after, Caesar, a man among those in power, who had formerly been advanced to the\ndignity of consul and prefect, lost his wife, and caused her to be interred near the tomb of Eusebia;\nfor the two ladies had been knit together by the most tender friendship, and had been of one mind on\nall doctrinal and religious subjects. Caesar was hence induced to purchase this place so that he\nmight be entombed near his wife. The aforesaid monks settled elsewhere, and without divulging\nanything about the martyrs. After this, when the building was demolished, and when the earth and\nrefuse were scattered about, the whole place was smoothed off. For Caesarius himself erected there a\nmagnificent temple to God to the honor of Thyrsus, the martyr. It appears probable that God\ndesignedly willed the aforesaid place to disappear, and so long a time to elapse in order that the\ndiscovery of the martyrs might be regarded as more marvelous and a more conspicuous event, and as a\nproof of the Divine favor towards the discoverer. The discoverer was, in fact, no other than the\nEmpress Pulcheria, the sister of the emperor. The admirable Thyrsus appeared to her three times, and\nrevealed to her those concealed beneath the earth; and commanded that they should be deposited near\nhis tomb, in order that they might share in the same position and honor. The forty martyrs themselves\nalso appeared to her, arrayed in shining robes. But the occurrence seemed too marvelous to be\ncredible, and altogether impossible; for the aged of clergy of that region, after having frequently\nprosecuted inquiries, had not been able to indicate the position of the martyrs, nor indeed had any\none else. At length, when everything was hopeless, Polychronius, a certain presbyter, who had\nformerly been a servant in the household of Caesar, was reminded by God that the locality in question\nhad once been inhabited by monks. He therefore went to the clergy of the Macedonian sect to inquire\nconcerning them. All the monks were dead, with the exception of one, who seemed to have been\npreserved in life for the express purpose of pointing out the spot where the relics of the holy\nmartyrs were concealed. Polychronius. questioned him closely on the subject, and find ing that, on\naccount of the agreement made with Eusebia, his answers were somewhat undecided, he made known to him\nthe Divine revelation and the anxiety of the empress, as well as the failure of her recourses. The\nmonk then confessed that God had declared the truth to the empress; for at the time when he was an\novergrown boy, and was taught the monastic life by its aged leaders, he remembered exactly that the\nrelics of the martyrs had been deposited near the tomb of Eusebia; but that the subsequent lapse of\ntime, and the changes which had been carried on in that locality, deprived him of the power of\nrecalling to his recollection whether the relics had been deposited beneath the church or in any\nother spot. And further said Polychronius, \"I have not suffered a like lapse of memory, for I\nremember that I was present at the interment of the wife of Caesar, and, as well as I can judge from\nthe relative situation of the high road, I infer that she must have been buried beneath the ambo\";\nthis is the platform for the readers. \"Therefore,\" subjoined the monk, \"it must be near the remains\nof Caesar's wife that the tomb of Eusebia must be sought; for the two ladies lived on terms of the\nclosest friendship and intimacy, and mutually agreed to be interred beside each other.\" When it was\nnecessary to dig, according to the aforesaid intimations, and to track out the sacred relics, and the\nempress had learned the facts, she commanded them to begin the work. On digging up the earth by the\nambo, the coffin of Caesar's wife was discovered according to the conjecture of Polychronius. Ata\nshort distance on the side they found the, pavement of baked bricks, and a marble tablet of equal\ndimensions, each the measure of the bricks, under which the coffin of Eusebin was disclosed; and dose\nby was an oratory, elegantly inclosed with white and purple marble. The cover of the tomb was in the\nform, of a holy table, and at the summit, where the relics were deposited, a small orifice was\nvisible. A man attached to the palace, who happened to be standing by, thrust a cane which he held in\nhis hand into the orifice; and on withdrawing the cane he held it to his nose, and inhaled a sweet\nodor of myrrh, which inspired the workmen and bystanders with fresh confidence. When they had eagerly\nopened the coffin, the remains of Eusebia were found, and near her head was the prominent part of the\ntomb fashioned exactly in the form of a chest, and was concealed within by its own cover; and the\niron which inclosed it on each side at the edges was firmly held together by lead. In the middle, the\nsame orifice again appeared, and still more clearly revealed the fact of the relics being concealed\nwithin. As soon as the discovery was announced, they ran to the church of the martyr, and sent for\nsmiths to unfasten the iron bars, and easily drew off the lid. A great many perfumes were found\nthereunder, and among the perfumes two silver caskets were found in which lay the holy relics. Then\nthe princess returned thanks to God for having accounted her worthy of so great a manifestation and\nfor attaining the discovery of the holy relics. After this she honored the martyrs with the costliest\ncasket; and on the conclusion of a public festival which was celebrated with befitting honor and with\na procession to the accompaniment of psalms, and at which I was present, the relics were placed\nalongside of the godlike Thyrsus. And others who were present can also bear testimony that these\nthings were done in the way described, for almost all of them still survive. And the event occurred\nmuch later, when Proclus governed the church of Constantinople.","index":"23","references":[{"fn":"46","code":"P4658_2131494","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"This chapter is independent.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"46","code":"P4659_2131684","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"Cf.

He caused Alaric, the\nleader of the Goths, to secure the office of general of the Romans, and advised him to seize Illyria;\nand, having sent forward Jovian, the appointed prefect, he agreed to join him shortly with Roman\ntroops, and to reduce its subjects under the ruleof Honorius.

After the death of Arcadius, Honorius projected a journey to\nConstantinople, in behalf of his nephew, to appoint officers faithful to his security and empire; for\nhe held his nephew in the place of his son, and he was fearful lest the boy might suffer on account\nof his youth, since he would be exposed to plots; but when Honorius was on the very point of setting\nout on this journey, Stilicho dissuaded him from his design, by proving to him that his presence was\nrequisite in Italy, to repress the schemes of Constantine, who sought to possess himself of the\nsovereign power at Aries.
