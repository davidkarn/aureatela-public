In any case, however it may be, what you have done is worthy of blame, beloved Dracontius. For it was not fitting that after receiving the grace you should hide, nor that, being a wise man, you should furnish others with a pretext for flight. For many are offended when they hear it; not merely that you have done this, but that you have done it having regard to the times and to the afflictions which are weighing upon the Church. And I fear lest, in flying for your own sake, you prove to be in peril in the sight of the Lord on account of others. For if `he that offendeth one of the little ones, should rather choose that a mill stone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depths of the sea[fn-98-P9832_3511466:3-nf] ,' what can be in store for you, if you prove an offence to so many? For the surprising unanimity about your election in the district[fn-98-P9833_3511619:4-nf] of Alexandria will of necessity be broken up by your retirement: and the episcopate of the district will be grasped at by many,-and many unfit persons, as you are well aware.

How will you heal those who on your account are fallen and offended? Or how will you be able to restore the broken peace? Beloved Dracontius, you have caused us grief instead of joy, groaning instead of consolation. For we expected to have you with us as a consolation; and now we behold you in flight, and that you will be convicted in judgment, and when upon your trial will repent it. And `Who shall have pity upon thee[fn-98-P9835_3512911:5-nf] ,' as the Prophet says, who will turn his mind to you for peace, when he sees the brethren for whom Christ died injured on account of your flight?

When then they expect, and suffer hunger, and you are feeding yourself[fn-98-P9836_3513454:6-nf] only, and our Lord Jesus Christ comes and we stand before Him, what defence will you offer when He sees His own sheep hungering? For had you not taken the money, He would not have blamed you.

Take thought of the Church, lest many of the little ones be injured on your account, and the others be given an occasion of withdrawing. Nay but it you feared the times and acted as you did from timidity, your mind is not manly; for in such a case you ought to manifest zeal for Christ, and rather meet circumstances boldly, and use the language of blessed Paul: `in all these things we are more than conquerors[fn-98-P9839_3514585:8-nf] ;' and the more so in that we ought to serve not the time, but the Lord[fn-98-P9840_3514675:9-nf] .

Or if our successors are to inherit this state of mind, how will the Churches be able to hold together? Or do your advisers think that you have received nothing, that they despise it? If so surely they are wrong. For it is time for them to think that the grace of the Font is nothing, if some are found to despise it. But you have received it, beloved Dracontius; do not tolerate your advisers nor deceive yourself. For this will be required of you by the God who gave it. Have you not heard the Apostle say, `Neglect not the gift that is in thee[fn-98-P9843_3516232:11-nf] ?' or have you not read how he accepts the man that had doubled his money, while he condemned the one that had hidden it? But may it come to pass that you may quickly return, in order that you too may be one of those who are praised. Or tell me, whom do your advisers wish you to imitate? For we ought to walk by the standard of the saints and the fathers, and imitate them, and to be sure that if we depart from them we put ourselves also out of their fellowship. Whom then do they wish you to imitate? The one who hesitated, and while wishing to follow, delayed it and took counsel because of his family[fn-98-P9844_3516858:12-nf] , or blessed Paul, who, the moment the stewardship was entrusted to him, `straightway conferred not with flesh and blood[fn-98-P9845_3516997:13-nf] ?' For although he said, `I am not worthy to be called an Apostle[fn-98-P9846_3517080:14-nf] ,' yet, knowing what he had received, and being not ignorant of the giver, he wrote, `For woe is me if I preach not the gospel[fn-98-P9847_3517226:15-nf] .' But, as it was `woe to me' if he did not preach, so, in teaching and preaching the gospel, he had his converts as his joy and crown[fn-98-P9848_3517378:16-nf] . This explains why the saint[fn-98-P9849_3517427:17-nf] was zealous to preach as far as Illyricum, and not to shrink from proceeding to Rome[fn-98-P9850_3517555:18-nf] , or even going as far as the Spains[fn-98-P9851_3517609:19-nf] , in order that the more he laboured, he might receive so much the greater reward for his labour. He boasted then that he had fought the good fight, and was confident that he should receive the great crown[fn-98-P9852_3517836:20-nf] . Therefore, beloved Dracontius, whom are you imitating in your present action? Paul, or men unlike him?

Or possibly there are some who advise you to hide, because you have given your word upon oath not to accept the office it elected. For I hear that they are buzzing in your ears to this effect, and consider that they are thus acting conscientiously. But if they were truly conscientious, they would above all have feared God, Who imposed this ministry upon you. Or if they had read the divine Scriptures, they would not have advised you contrary to them. For it is time for them to blame Jeremiah also, and to impeach the great Moses, in that they did not listen to their advice, but fearing God fulfilled their ministry, and prophesying were made perfect. For they also when they had received their mission and the grace of Prophecy, refused. But afterwards they feared, and did not set at nought Him that sent them. Whether then you be of stammering utterance, and slow of tongue, yet fear God that made you, or if you call yourself too young to preach, yet reverence Him Who knew you before you were made. Or if you have given your word (now their word was to the saints as an oath), yet read Jeremiah, how he too had said, `I will not name the Name of the Lord[fn-98-P9854_3519223:21-nf] ,' yet afterwards he feared the fire kindled within him, and did not do as he had said, nor hid himself as if bound by an oath, but reverenced Him that had entrusted to him his office, and fulfilled the prophetic call.

I ask you, beloved Dracontius, whether knowing this, and being a wise man, you are not pricked in your soul? Do you not feel anxious lest any of those entrusted to you should perish? Do you not burn, as with a fire in your conscience? Are you not in fear of the day of judgment, in which none of your present advisers will be there to aid you?

For you are not the only one who has been elected from among monks, nor the only one to have presided over a monastery, or to have been beloved by monks.
