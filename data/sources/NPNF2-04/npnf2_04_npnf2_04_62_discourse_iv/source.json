The substantiality of the Word proved from Scripture. If the One Origin be substantial, Its Word is substantial.

The Word is God from God; for `the Word was God[fn-70-P7091_2819848:1-nf] ,' and again, `Of whom are the Fathers, and of whom Christ, who is God over all, blessed for ever. Amen[fn-70-P7092_2819966:2-nf] .' And since Christ is God from God, and God's Word, Wisdom, Son, and Power, therefore but One God is declared in the divine Scriptures. For the Word, being Son of the One God, is referred to Him of whom also He is; so that Father and Son are two, yet the Monad of the Godhead is indivisible and inseparable. And thus too we preserve One Beginning of Godhead and not two Beginnings, whence there is strictly a Monarchy. And of this very Beginning the Word is by nature Son, not as if another beginning, subsisting by Himself, nor having come into being externally to that Beginning, lest from that diversity a Dyarchy and Polyarchy should ensue; but of the one Beginning He is own Son, own Wisdom, own Word, existing from It. For, according to John, `in' that `Beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,' for the Beginning was God; and since He is from It, therefore also `the Word was God.' And as there is one Beginning and therefore one God, so one is that Essence and Subsistence which indeed and truly and really is, and which said `I am that I am[fn-70-P7093_2821042:3-nf] ,' and not two, that there be not two Beginnings; and from the One, a Son in nature and truth, is Its own Word, Its Wisdom, Its Power, and inseparable from It. And as there is not another essence, lest there be two Beginnings, so the Word which is from that One Essence has no dissolution, nor is a sound significative, but is an essential Word and essential Wisdom, which is the true Son. For were He not essential, God will be speaking into the air[fn-70-P7094_2821511:4-nf] , and having a body, in nothing differently from men; but since He is not man, neither is His Word according to the infirmity of man[fn-70-P7095_2821662:5-nf] . For as the Beginning is one Essence, so Its Word is one, essential, and subsisting, and Its Wisdom. For as He is God from God, and Wisdom from the Wise, and Word from the Rational, and Son from Father, so is He from Subsistence Subsistent, and from Essence Essential and Substantive, and Being from Being.","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"70","code":"P7091_2819848","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"John i. x.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"70","code":"P7092_2819966","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Rom. ix. 5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":9,"verses":[5]}]},{"fn":"70","code":"P7093_2821042","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Exod. iii. 14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"exodus","chapter":3,"verses":[14]}]},{"fn":"70","code":"P7094_2821511","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"1 Cor. xiv. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":14,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"70","code":"P7095_2821662","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Or. ii. 7.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"2. Since were He not essential Wisdom and substantive Word, and Son existing, but simply Wisdom and Word and Son in the Father, then the Father Himself would have a nature compounded of Wisdom and Word. But if so, the forementioned absurdities would follow; and He will be His own Father, and the Son begetting and begotten by Himself; or Word, Wisdom, Son, is a name only, and He does not subsist who owns, or rather who is, these titles. If then He does not subsist, the names are idle and empty, unless we say that God is Very Wisdom[fn-70-P7097_2822520:6-nf] and Very Word. But if so, He is His own Father and Son; Father, when Wise, Son, when Wisdom; but these things are not in God as a certain quality; away with the dishonourable[fn-70-P7098_2822731:7-nf] thought; for it will issue in this, that God is compounded of essence and quality[fn-70-P7099_2822820:8-nf] . For whereas all quality is in essence, it will clearly follow that the Divine Monad, indivisible as it is, must be compound, being severed into essence and accident[fn-71-P7100_2823007:9-nf] . We must ask then these headstrong men; The Son was proclaimed as God's Wisdom and Word; how then is He such? if as a quality, the absurdity has been shewn; but if God is that Very Wisdom, then it is the absurdity of Sabellius; therefore He is so, as an Offspring in a proper sense from the Father Himself, according to the illustration of light. For as there is light from fire, so from God is there a Word, and Wisdom from the Wise, and from the Father a Son. For in this way the Monad remains undivided and entire, and Its Son, Word not unessential, nor not subsisting, but essential truly. For were it not so, all that is said would be said notionally[fn-71-P7101_2823754:10-nf] and verbally[fn-71-P7102_2823790:11-nf] . But if we must avoid that absurdity, then is a true Word essential. For as there is a Father truly, so Wisdom truly. In this respect then they are two; not because, as Sabellius said, Father and Son are the same, but because the Father is Father and the Son Son, and they are one, because He is Son of the Essence of the Father by nature, existing as His own Word. This the Lord said, viz. `I and the Father are One[fn-71-P7103_2824230:12-nf] ;' for neither is the Word separated from the Father, nor was or is the Father ever Wordless; on this account He says, `I in the Father and the Father in Me[fn-71-P7104_2824404:13-nf] .'","index":"4","references":[{"fn":"70","code":"P7097_2822520","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Or. ii. 19, n. 3, and below, §4.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"70","code":"P7098_2822731","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"§9.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"70","code":"P7099_2822820","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Cf. ad Afros. 8.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7100_2823007","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Cf.

And again, Christ is the Word of God. Did He then subsist by Himself, and subsisting, has He become joined to the Father, or did God make Him or call Him His Word? If the former, I mean if He subsisted by Himself and is God, then there are two Beginnings; and moreover, as is plain, He is not the Father's own, as being not of the Father, but of Himself. But if on the contrary He be made externally, then is He a creature. It remains then to say that He is from God Himself; but if so, that which is from another is one thing, and that from which it is, is a second; according to this then there are two. But if they be not two, but the names belong to the same, cause and effect will be the same, and begotten and begetting, which has been shewn absurd in the instance of Sabellius. But if He be from Him, yet not another, He will be both begetting and not begetting; begetting because He produces from Himself, and not begetting, because it is nothing other than Himself. But if so, the same is called Father and Son notionally. But if it be unseemly so to say, Father and Son must be two; and they are one, because the Son is not from without, but begotten of God. But if any one shrinks from saying `Offspring,' and only says that the Word exists with God, let such a one fear lest, shrinking from what is said in Scripture, he fall into absurdity, making God a being of double nature. For not granting that the Word is from the Monad, but simply as if He were joined to the Father, he introduces a twofold essence, and neither of them Father of the other. And the same of Power. And we may see this more clearly, if we consider it with reference to the Father; for there is One Father, and not two, but from that One the Son. As then there are not two Fathers, but One, so not two Beginnings, but One, and from that One the Son essential.","index":"5","references":[]},{"text":"4. But the Arians we must ask contrariwise: (for the Sabellianisers must be confuted from the notion of a Son, and the Arians from that of a Father:) let us say then-Is God wise and not word-less: or on the contrary, is He wisdom-less and word-less[fn-71-P7107_2826520:14-nf] ? if the latter, there is an absurdity at once; if the former, we must ask, how is He wise and not word-less? does He possess the Word and the Wisdom from without, or from Himself? If from without, there must be one who first gave to Him, and before He received He was wisdom-less and word-less. But if from Himself, it is plain that the Word is not from nothing, nor once was not; for He was ever; since He of whom He is the Image, exists ever. But if they say that He is indeed wise and not word-less, but that He has in Himself His own wisdom and own word, and that, not Christ, but that by which He made Christ, we must answer that, if Christ in that word was brought to be, plainly so were all things; and it must be He of whom John says, `All things were made by Him,' and the Psalmist, `In Wisdom hast Thou made them all[fn-71-P7108_2827370:15-nf] .' And Christ will be found to speak untruly, `I in the Father,' there being another in the Father. And `the Word became flesh[fn-71-P7109_2827526:16-nf] ' is not true according to them. For if He in whom `all things came to be,' Himself became flesh, but Christ is not in the Father, as Word `by whom all things came to be,' then Christ has not become flesh, but perhaps Christ was named Word. But if so, first, there will be another besides the name, next, all things were not by Him brought to be, but in that other, in whom Christ also was made. But if they say that Wisdom is in the Father as a quality or that He is Very Wisdom[fn-71-P7110_2828022:17-nf] , the absurdities will follow already mentioned. For He will be compound[fn-71-P7111_2828104:18-nf] , and will prove His own Son and Father[fn-71-P7112_2828158:19-nf] . Moreover, we must confute and silence them on the ground, that the Word which is in God cannot be a creature nor out of nothing; but if once a Word be in God, then He must be Christ who says, `I am in the Father and the Father in Me[fn-71-P7113_2828403:20-nf] ,' who also is therefore the Only-begotten, since no other was begotten from Him. This is One Son, who is Word, Wisdom, Power; for God is not compounded of these, but is generative[fn-71-P7114_2828604:21-nf] of them. For as He frames the creatures by the Word, so according to the nature of His own Essence has He the Word as an Offspring, through whom He frames and creates and dispenses all things. For by the Word and the Wisdom all things have come to be, and all things together remain according to His ordinance[fn-71-P7115_2828934:22-nf] . And the same concerning the word `Son;' if God be without Son[fn-71-P7116_2829017:23-nf] , then is He without Work; for the Son is His Offspring through whom He works[fn-71-P7117_2829117:24-nf] ; but if not, the same questions and the same absurdities will follow their audacity.","index":"6","references":[{"fn":"71","code":"P7107_2826520","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Or. i. 19, n. 5.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7108_2827370","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"John i. 3; Ps. civ. 24.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":1,"verses":[3]},{"book":"psalms","chapter":104,"verses":[24]},{"book":"john","chapter":1,"verses":[3]},{"book":"psalms","chapter":104,"verses":[24]}]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7109_2827526","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"John i. 14","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":1,"verses":[14]}]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7110_2828022","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"§2.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7111_2828104","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"§9, fin.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7112_2828158","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"§10.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7113_2828403","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"John xiv. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":14,"verses":[10]}]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7114_2828604","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"iii. 66, n. 3.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7115_2828934","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Ps. cxix. 91.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":119,"verses":[91]}]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7116_2829017","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Or. ii. 2, n. 3.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7117_2829117","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Or. ii. 41; iii. 11, n. 4.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"5. From Deuteronomy; `But ye that did attach yourselves unto the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day[fn-71-P7119_2829349:25-nf] .' From this we may see the difference, and know that the Son of God is not a creature. For the Son says, `I and the Father are One,' and, `I in the Father, and the Father in Me;' but things originate, when they make advance, are attached unto the Lord. The Word then is in the Father as being His own; but things originate, being external, are attached, as being by nature foreign, and attached by free choice. For a son which is by nature, is one[fn-71-P7120_2829816:26-nf] with him who begat him; but he who is from without, and is made a son, will be attached to the family. Therefore he immediately adds, `What nation is there so great who hath God drawing nigh unto them[fn-71-P7121_2830035:27-nf] ?' and elsewhere, `I a God drawing nigh[fn-71-P7122_2830098:28-nf] ;' for to things originate He draws nigh, as being strange to Him, but to the Son, as being His own, He does not draw nigh, but He is in Him. And the Son is not attached to the Father, but co-exists with Him; whence also Moses says again in the same Deuteronomy, `Ye shall obey His voice, and apply yourselves unto Him[fn-71-P7123_2830443:29-nf] ;' but what is applied, is applied from without.","index":"7","references":[{"fn":"71","code":"P7119_2829349","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Deut. iv. 4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"deuteronomy","chapter":4,"verses":[4]}]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7120_2829816","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"i. 26, n. 2.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7121_2830035","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Deut. iv. 7, LXX.","bible_refs":[{"book":"deuteronomy","chapter":4,"verses":[7]}]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7122_2830098","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Jer. xxiii. 23, LXX.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7123_2830443","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Deut. xiii. 4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"deuteronomy","chapter":13,"verses":[4]}]}]},{"text":"§§6, 7.

When then He is said to hunger and weep and weary, and to cry Eloi, Eloi, which are our human affections, He receives them from us and offers to the Father[fn-71-P7127_2831345:31-nf] , interceding for us, that in Him they may be annulled[fn-71-P7128_2831432:32-nf] . And when it is said, `All power is given unto Me,' and `I received,' and `Wherefore God highly exalted Him,' these are gifts given from God to us through Him. For the Word was never in want[fn-71-P7129_2831656:33-nf] , nor has come into being[fn-71-P7130_2831698:34-nf] ; nor again were men sufficient to minister these things for themselves, but through the Word they are given to us; therefore, as if given to Him, they are imparted to us. For this was the reason of His becoming man, that, as being given to Him, they might pass on to us[fn-71-P7131_2831997:35-nf] . For of such gifts mere man had not become worthy; and again the mere Word had not needed them[fn-71-P7132_2832113:36-nf] ; the Word then was united to us, and then imparted to us power, and highly exalted us[fn-71-P7133_2832225:37-nf] . For the Word being in man, highly exalted man himself; and, when the Word was in man, man himself received. Since then, the Word being in flesh, man himself was exalted, and received power, therefore these things are referred to the Word, since they were given on His account; for on account of the Word in man were these gifts given. And as `the Word became flesh[fn-71-P7134_2832612:38-nf] ,' so also man himself received the gifts which came through the Word. For all that man himself has received, the Word is said to have received[fn-71-P7135_2832773:39-nf] ; that it might be shewn, that man himself, being unworthy to receive, as far as his own nature is concerned, yet has received because of the Word become flesh. Wherefore if anything be said to be given to the Lord, or the like, we must consider that it is given, not to Him as needing it, but to man himself through the Word. For every one interceding for another, receives the gift in his own person, not as needing, but on his account for whom he intercedes.","index":"9","references":[{"fn":"71","code":"P7126_2830911","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Matt. xxviii. 18; John x. 18; Phil. ii. 9; Eph. i. 20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":28,"verses":[18]},{"book":"john","chapter":10,"verses":[18]},{"book":"philippians","chapter":2,"verses":[9]},{"book":"ephesians","chapter":1,"verses":[20]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":28,"verses":[18]},{"book":"john","chapter":10,"verses":[18]},{"book":"philippians","chapter":2,"verses":[9]},{"book":"ephesians","chapter":1,"verses":[20]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":28,"verses":[18]},{"book":"john","chapter":10,"verses":[18]},{"book":"philippians","chapter":2,"verses":[9]},{"book":"ephesians","chapter":1,"verses":[20]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":28,"verses":[18]},{"book":"john","chapter":10,"verses":[18]},{"book":"philippians","chapter":2,"verses":[9]},{"book":"ephesians","chapter":1,"verses":[20]}]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7127_2831345","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"De Decr. 14; Or. ii. 8, 9.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7128_2831432","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Or. iii. 33, n. 6, and 34.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7129_2831656","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Or. i. 43.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7130_2831698","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Or. i. 43; ii. 65, 67.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7131_2831997","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Or. i. 42, 45.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7132_2832113","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Or. i. 48; iii. 38.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7133_2832225","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Or. i. 41, 42.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7134_2832612","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"John i. 14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":1,"verses":[14]}]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7135_2832773","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"iii. 38.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"7.

But if the two are one, then of necessity they are two, but one according to the Godhead, and according to the Son's coessentiality with the Father, and the Word's being from the Father Himself; so that there are two, because there is Father, and Son, namely the Word; and one because one God. For if not, He would have said, `I am the Father,' or `I and the Father am;' but, in fact, in the `I' He signifies the Son, and in the `And the Father,' Him who begat Him; and in the `One' the one Godhead and His coessentiality[fn-71-P7147_2836995:46-nf] . For the Same is not, as the Gentiles hold, Wise and Wisdom, or the Same Father and Word; for it were unfit for Him to be His own Father, but the divine teaching knows Father and Son, and Wise and Wisdom, and God and Word; while it ever guards Him indivisible and inseparable and indissoluble in all respects.","index":"14","references":[{"fn":"71","code":"P7146_2835990","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"John x. 30.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":10,"verses":[30]}]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7147_2836995","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Here again is the word omoousion.

And whence has He gained it? and wherefore? If, when He had the Word within Him, He could make, He begets needlessly, being able to make even in silence. Next, if the Word was in God before He was begotten, then being begotten He is without and external to Him. But if so, how says He now, `I in the Father and the Father in Me[fn-71-P7154_2840881:49-nf] ?' but if He is now in the Father, then always was He in the Father, as He is now, and needless is it to say, `For us was He begotten, and He reverts after we are formed, that He may be as He was.' For He was not anything which He is not now, nor is He what He was not; but He is as He ever was, and in the same state and in the same respects; otherwise He will seem to be imperfect and alterable. For if, what He was, that He shall be afterwards, as if now He were not so, it is plain, He is not now what He was and shall be. I mean, if He was before in God, and afterwards shall be again, it follows that now the Word is not in God. But the Lord refutes such persons when He says, `I in the Father and the Father in Me;' for so is He now as He ever was. But if so He now is, as He was ever, it follows, not that at one time He was begotten and not at another, nor that once there was silence with God, and then He spake, but there is ever a Father[fn-71-P7155_2841850:50-nf] , and a Son who is His Word, not in name[fn-71-P7156_2841909:51-nf] alone a Word, nor the Word in notion only a Son, but existing coessential[fn-71-P7157_2842002:52-nf] with the Father, not begotten for us, for we are brought into being for Him. For, if He were begotten for us, and in His begetting we were created, and in His generation the creature consists, and then He returns that He may be what He was before, first, He that was begotten will be again not begotten. For if His progression be generation, His return will be the close[fn-71-P7158_2842398:53-nf] of that generation, for when He has come to be in God, God will be silent again. But if He shall be silent, there will be what there was when He was silent, stillness and not creation, for the creation will cease to be. For, as on the Word's outgoing, the creation came to be, and existed, so on the Word's retiring, the creation will not exist. What use then for it to come into being, if it is to cease? or why did God speak, that then He should be silent? and why did He issue One whom He recalls? and why did He beget One whose generation He willed to cease? Again it is uncertain what He shall be. For either He will ever be silent, or He will again beget, and will devise a different creation (for He will not make the same, else that which was made would have remained, but another); and in due course He will bring that also to a close, and will devise another, and so on without end[fn-71-P7159_2843318:54-nf] .","index":"18","references":[{"fn":"71","code":"P7154_2840881","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"John xiv. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":14,"verses":[10]}]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7155_2841850","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"i. 21, n. 1.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7156_2841909","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"ii. 19, n. 3.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7157_2842002","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"omoousioj, 9, n. 2.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7158_2842398","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"paula. cf. ii. 34, 35.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7159_2843318","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"eij apeiron, ii. 68.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"§§13, 14.

And as, supposing the Corinthians being straitened were in turn dilated, they had not been others, but still Corinthians, so if the Father was dilated into a Triad, the Triad again is the Father alone. And he says again the same thing, `Our heart is dilated[fn-71-P7166_2845568:58-nf] ;' and Noah says, `May God dilate for Japheth[fn-71-P7167_2845631:59-nf] ,' for the same heart and the same Japheth is in the dilatation. If then the Monad dilated, it would dilate for others; but if it dilated for itself, then it would be that which was dilated; and what is that but the Son and Holy Spirit? And it is well to ask him, when thus speaking, what was the action[fn-71-P7168_2845958:60-nf] of this dilatation? or, in very truth, wherefore at all it took place? for what does not remain the same, but is in course of time dilated, must necessarily have a cause of dilatation. If then it was in order that Word and Spirit should be with Him, it is beside the purpose to say, `First Monad, and then dilated;' for Word and Spirit were not afterwards, but ever, or God would be wordless[fn-71-P7169_2846393:61-nf] , as the Arians hold. So that if Word and Spirit were ever, ever was it dilated, and not at first a Monad; but if it were dilated afterwards, then afterwards is there a Word. But if for the Incarnation it was dilated, and then became a Triad, then before the Incarnation there was not yet a Triad. And it will seem even that the Father became flesh, if, that is, He be the Monad, and was dilated in the Man; and thus perhaps there will only be a Monad, and flesh, and thirdly Spirit; if, that is, He was Himself dilated; and there will be in name only a Triad. It is absurd too to say that it was dilated for creating; for it were possible for it, remaining a Monad, to make all; for the Monad did not need dilatation, nor was wanting in power before being dilated; it is absurd surely and impious, to think or speak thus in the case of God. Another absurdity too will follow. For if it was dilated for the sake of the creation, and while it was a Monad the creation was not, but upon the Consummation it will be again a Monad after dilatation, then the creation too will come to nought.

For if He did not say it in words, still He has referred the sense of `are One' to the Son. For nothing is one with the Father, but what is from Him. What is that which is from Him but the Son? And therefore He adds, `that ye may know that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me.' For, when expounding the `One,' He said that the union and the inseparability lay, not in This being That, with which It was One, but in His being in the Father and the Father in the Son. For thus He overthrows both Sabellius, in saying, `I am' not, \"the Father,\" but, `the Son of God;' and Arius, in saying, `are One.'

For in the beginning of the Gospel, the Evangelist, speaking of John the Baptist, says, `He was not that Light, but that he might bear witness concerning that Light[fn-71-P7194_2857050:80-nf] .' For Christ Himself was, as we have said before, the True Light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world. For if `He was in the world, and the world was made by Him[fn-71-P7195_2857242:81-nf] ,' of necessity He is the Word of God, concerning whom also the Evangelist witnesses that all things were made by Him. For either they will be compelled to speak of two worlds, that the one may have come into being by the Son and the other by the Word, or, if the world is one and the creation one, it follows that Son and Word are one and the same before all creation, for by Him it came into being. Therefore if as by the Word, so by the Son also all things came to be, it will not be contradictory, but even identical to say, for instance, `In the beginning was the Word,' or, `In the beginning was the Son.' But if because John did not say, `In the beginning was the Son,' they shall maintain that the attributes of the Word do not suit with the Son, it at once follows that the attributes of the Son do not suit with the Word. But it was shewn that to the Son belongs, `I and the Father are One,' and that it is He `Who is in the bosom of the Father,' and, `He that seeth Me, seeth Him that sent Me[fn-71-P7196_2858262:82-nf] ;' and that `the world was brought into being by Him,' is common to the Word and the Son; so that from this the Son is shewn to be before the world; for of necessity the Framer is before the things brought into being. And what is said to Philip must belong, according to them, not to the Word, but to the Son. For, `Jesus said,' says Scripture, `Have I been so long time with you, and yet thou hast not known Me, Philip? He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father. And how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father? Believest thou not, that I am in the Father and the Father in Me? the words that I speak unto you, I speak not of Myself, but the Father that dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works. Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me, or else, believe Me for the very works' sake. Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also, and greater works than these shall he do, because I go unto the Father. And whatsoever ye shall ask in My Name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son[fn-71-P7197_2859363:83-nf] .' Therefore if the Father be glorified in the Son, the Son must be He who said, `I in the Father and the Father in Me;' and He who said, `He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father;' for He, the same who thus spoke, shews Himself to be the Son, by adding, `that the Father may be glorified in the Son.'","index":"27","references":[{"fn":"71","code":"P7194_2857050","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Ib. i. 8.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7195_2857242","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Ib. i. 10.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7196_2858262","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"John x. 30; John 1:18; John xii. 45.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":10,"verses":[30]},{"book":"john","chapter":1,"verses":[1]},{"book":"john","chapter":12,"verses":[45]},{"book":"john","chapter":10,"verses":[30]},{"book":"john","chapter":1,"verses":[1]},{"book":"john","chapter":12,"verses":[45]},{"book":"john","chapter":10,"verses":[30]},{"book":"john","chapter":1,"verses":[1]},{"book":"john","chapter":12,"verses":[45]}]},{"fn":"71","code":"P7197_2859363","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Ib. xiv. 9-13.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"20.

And they will be compelled to say that through the Man Himself the world came into being, and that the Man was He who came not to judge the world but to save it; and that He it was who was in being before Abraham came to be. For, says Scripture, Jesus said to them, `Verily, verily, I say unto you, before Abraham was, I am[fn-71-P7199_2860314:84-nf] .' And is it not absurd to say, as they do, that one who came of the seed of Abraham after two and forty generations[fn-72-P7200_2860451:85-nf] , should exist before Abraham came to be? is it not absurd, if the flesh, which the Word bore, itself is the Son, to say that the flesh from Mary is that by which the world was made? and how will they retain `He was in the world?' for the Evangelist, by way of signifying the Son's antecedence to the birth according to the flesh, goes on to say, `He was in the world.' And how, if not the Word but the Man is the Son, can He save the world, being Himself one of the world? And if this does not shame them, where shall be the Word, the Man being in the Father? And where will the Word stand to the Father, the Man and the Father being One? But if the Man be Only-begotten, what will be the place of the Word? Either one must say that He comes second, or, if He be above the Only-begotten, He must be the Father Himself. For as the Father is One, so also the Only-begotten from Him is One; and what has the Word above the Man, if the Word is not the Son? For, while Scripture says that through the Son and the Word the world was brought to be, and it is common to the Word and to the Son to frame the world, yet Scripture proceeds to place the sight of the Father, not in the Word but in the Son, and to attribute the saving of the world, not to the Word, but to the Only-begotten Son. For, saith it, Jesus said, `Have I been so long while with you, and yet hast thou not known Me, Philip? He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father.'

If then, as they hold, the Word is one and the Son another, and the Word is not the Son, Baptism has no connection with the Word. How then are they able to hold that the Word is with the Father, when He is not with Him in the giving of Baptism? But perhaps they will say, that in the Father's Name the Word is included? Wherefore then not the Spirit also? or is the Spirit external to the Father? and the Man indeed (if the Word is not Son) is named after the Father, but the Spirit after the Man? and then the Monad, instead of dilating into a Triad, dilates according to them into a Tetrad, Father, Word, Son, and Holy Ghost. Being brought to shame on this ground, they have recourse to another, and say that not the Man by Himself whom the Lord bore, but both together, the Word and the Man, are the Son; for both joined together are named Son, as they say.

But he says, that He is sometimes called our Father also, because He has Himself become partaker in our flesh. For on this account the Word has become flesh, that, since the Word is Son, therefore, because of the Son dwelling in us[fn-72-P7206_2864787:89-nf] , He may be called our Father also; for `He sent forth,' says Scripture, `the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father[fn-72-P7207_2864944:90-nf] .' Therefore the Son in us, calling upon His own Father, causes Him to be named our Father also. Surely in whose hearts the Son is not, of them neither can God be called Father. But if because of the Word the Man is called Son, it follows necessarily, since the ancients[fn-72-P7208_2865232:91-nf] are called sons even before the Incarnation, that the Word is Son even before His sojourn among us; for `I begat sons,' saith Scripture; and in the time of Noah, `When the sons of God saw,' and in the Song, `Is not He thy Father[fn-72-P7209_2865479:92-nf] ?'

But if, as they say again, neither of the two is Son, but it depends on the concurrence of the two, it follows that neither is Son; I say, neither the Word nor the Man, but some cause, on account of which they were united; and accordingly that cause which makes the Son will precede the uniting. Therefore in this way also the Son was before the flesh. When this then is urged, they will take refuge in another pretext, saying, neither that the Man is Son, nor both together, but that the Word was Word indeed simply in the beginning, but when He became Man, then He was named[fn-72-P7210_2866183:93-nf] Son; for before His appearing He was not Son but Word only; and as the `Word be came flesh,' not being flesh before, so the Word became Son, not being Son before.

Next, on their shewing, if what is contained in the Old is of older date, and what in the New of later, and times depend upon the writing, it follows that `I and the Father are One,' and `Only-begotten,' and `He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father[fn-72-P7216_2868708:98-nf] ,' are later, for these testimonies are adduced not from the Old but from the New.","index":"31","references":[{"fn":"72","code":"P7212_2866903","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Matt. xi. 27; John i. 18.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":11,"verses":[27]},{"book":"john","chapter":1,"verses":[18]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":11,"verses":[27]},{"book":"john","chapter":1,"verses":[18]}]},{"fn":"72","code":"P7213_2867050","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"John xiv. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":14,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"72","code":"P7214_2867647","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"1 Sam. ii. 27, LXX.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 samuel","chapter":2,"verses":[27]}]},{"fn":"72","code":"P7215_2868418","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Cf. i. 53, n. 7; iii. 35, n. 5.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"72","code":"P7216_2868708","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"John x. 30; John i. 18; John xiv. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":10,"verses":[30]},{"book":"john","chapter":1,"verses":[18]},{"book":"john","chapter":14,"verses":[9]},{"book":"john","chapter":10,"verses":[30]},{"book":"john","chapter":1,"verses":[18]},{"book":"john","chapter":14,"verses":[9]},{"book":"john","chapter":10,"verses":[30]},{"book":"john","chapter":1,"verses":[18]},{"book":"john","chapter":14,"verses":[9]}]}]},{"text":"24.

If then from the Old be ancientness, ancient must be the Son, who is clearly described in the Old Testament in many places. `Yes,' they say, `so it is, but it must be taken prophetically.' Therefore also the Word must be said to be spoken of prophetically; for this is not to be taken one way, that another.

And if the words in the forty-fourth Psalm `for My Well-beloved' refer to the future, so does what follows upon them, `My heart uttered a good Word.' And if `From the womb' relates to a man, therefore also `From the heart.' For if the womb is human, so is the heart corporeal. But if what is from the heart is eternal, then what is `From the womb' is eternal. And if the `Only-begotten' is `in the bosom,' therefore the `Well-beloved' is `in the bosom.' For `Only-begotten' and `Well-beloved' are the same, as in the words `This is My Well-beloved Son[fn-72-P7224_2871046:105-nf] .' For not as wishing to signify His love towards Him did He say `Well-beloved,' as if it might appear that He hated others, but He made plain thereby His being Only-begotten, that He might shew that He alone was from Him. And hence the Word, with a view of conveying to Abraham the idea of `Only-begotten,' says, `Offer thy son thy well-beloved[fn-72-P7225_2871455:106-nf] ;' but it is plain to any one that Isaac was the only son from Sara. The Word then is Son, not lately come to be, or named Son, but always Son. For if not Son, neither is He Word; and if not Word, neither is He Son. For that which is from the father is a son; and what is from the Father, but that Word that went forth from the heart, and was born from the womb? for the Father is not Word, nor the Word Father, but the one is Father, and the other Son; and one begets, and the other is begotten.","index":"32","references":[{"fn":"72","code":"P7218_2868983","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Ps. ii. 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":2,"verses":[7]}]},{"fn":"72","code":"P7219_2869030","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Ib. ix. title xlv. title.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"72","code":"P7220_2869422","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Is. v. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":5,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"72","code":"P7221_2869582","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Ps. cx. 3, LXX.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":110,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"72","code":"P7222_2869770","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Prov. viii. 25, LXX.; Dan. iii. 25.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","chapter":8,"verses":[25]},{"book":"daniel","chapter":3,"verses":[25]},{"book":"proverbs","chapter":8,"verses":[25]},{"book":"daniel","chapter":3,"verses":[25]}]},{"fn":"72","code":"P7223_2870391","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Cf.

While he says here that `the Life,' not `became,' but `was with the Father,' in the end of his Epistle he says the Son is the Life, writing, `And we are in Him that is True, even in His Son, Jesus Christ; this is the True God and Eternal Life[fn-72-P7237_2875084:114-nf] .' But if the Son is the Life, and the Life was with the Father, and if the Son was with the Father, and the same Evangelist says, `And the Word was with God[fn-72-P7238_2875260:115-nf] ,' the Son must be the Word, which is ever with the Father. And as the `Son' is `Word,' so `God' must be `the Father.' Moreover, the Son, according to John, is not merely `God' but `True God;' for according to the same Evangelist, `And the Word was God;' and the Son said, `I am the Life[fn-72-P7239_2875566:116-nf] .'

If then, because the `womb' is human, therefore it is foreign to God, plainly `heart' too has a human meaning[fn-72-P7247_2877215:123-nf] , for that which has heart has womb also. Since then both are human, we must deny both, or seek to explain both. Now as a word is from the heart, so is an offspring from the womb; and as when the heart of God is spoken of, we do not conceive of it as human, so if Scripture says `from the womb,' we must not take it in a corporeal sense. For it is usual with divine Scripture to speak and signify in the way of man what is above man. Thus speaking of the creation it says, `Thy hands made me and fashioned me,' and, `Thy hand made all these things,' and, `He commanded and they were created[fn-72-P7248_2877818:124-nf] .'

What means then, say they, `Before the morning star?' I would answer, that if `Before the morning star' shews that His birth from Mary was wonderful, many others besides have been born before the rising of the star. What then is said so wonderful in His instance, that He should record it as some choice prerogative[fn-72-P7250_2878546:125-nf] , when it is common to many? Next, to beget differs from bringing forth; for begetting involves the primary foundation, but to bring forth is nothing else than the production of what exists. If then the term belongs to the body, let it be observed that He did not then receive a beginning of coming to be when he was evangelized to the shepherds by night, but when the Angel spoke to the Virgin. And that was not night, for this is not said; on the contrary, it was night when He issued from the womb. This difference Scripture makes, and says on the one hand that He was begotten before the morning star, and on the other speaks of His proceeding from the womb, as in the twenty-first Psalm, `Thou art he that drew Me from the womb[fn-72-P7251_2879311:126-nf] .' Besides, He did not say, `before the rising of the morning star,' but simply `before the morning star.' If then the phrase must be taken of the body, then either the body must be before Adam, for the stars were before Adam, or we have to investigate the sense of the letter. And this John enables us to do, who says in the Apocalypse, `I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end. Blessed are they who make broad their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever maketh and loveth a lie. I Jesus have sent My Angel, to testify these things in the Churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the Bright and Morning Star.

If then `the Offspring of David' be the `Bright and Morning Star,' it is plain that the flesh of the Saviour is called `the Morning Star,' which the Offspring from God preceded; so that the sense of the Psalm is this, `I have begotten Thee from Myself before Thy appearance in the flesh;' for `before the Morning Star' is equivalent to `before the Incarnation of the Word.'","index":"38","references":[{"fn":"72","code":"P7250_2878546","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"ecairetou, ii. 19, n. 6.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"72","code":"P7251_2879311","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Ps. xxii. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":22,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"72","code":"P7252_2880320","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Rev. xxii. 13-17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"revelation","chapter":22,"verses":[13]}]}]},{"text":"29. Thus in the Old also, statements are plainly made concerning the Son; at the same time it is superfluous to argue the point; for if what is not stated in the Old is of later date, let them who are thus disputatious, say where in the Old is mention made of the Spirit, the Paraclete? for of the Holy Spirit there is mention, but nowhere of the Paraclete. Is then the Holy Spirit one, and the Paraclete another, and the Paraclete the later, as not mentioned in the Old? but far be it to say that the Spirit is later, or to distinguish the Holy Ghost as one and the Paraclete as another; for the Spirit is one and the same, then and now hallowing and comforting those who are His recipients; as one and the same Word and Son led even then to adoption of sons those who were worthy[fn-72-P7254_2881504:128-nf] . For sons under the Old were made such through no other than the Son. For unless even before Mary there were a Son who was of God, how is He before all, when they are sons before Him? and how also `First-born,' if He comes second after many? But neither is the Paraclete second, for He was before all, nor the Son later; for `in the beginning was the Word[fn-72-P7255_2881885:129-nf] .' And as the Spirit and Paraclete are the same, so the Son and Word are the same; and as the Saviour says concerning the Spirit, `But the Paraclete which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in My Name[fn-72-P7256_2882114:130-nf] ,' speaking of One and Same, and not distinguishing, so John describes similarly when he says, `And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, glory as of one Only-begotten from the Father[fn-72-P7257_2882348:131-nf] .'

And as the Paraclete is not one and the Holy Ghost another, but one and the same, so Word is not one, and Son another, but the Word is Only-Begotten; for He says not the glory of the flesh itself, but of the Word. He then who dares distinguish between Word and Son, let him distinguish between Spirit and Paraclete; but if the Spirit cannot be distinguished, so neither can the Word, being also Son and Wisdom and Power. Moreover, the word `Well-beloved' even the Greeks who are skilful in phrases know to be equivalent with `Only-begotten.'

For those who in this place separate the divine Word from the divine Incarnation, have, it seems, a degraded notion of the doctrine of His having become flesh, and entertain Gentile thoughts, as they do, conceiving that the divine Incarnation is an alteration of the Word.

But if Scripture often calls even the body by the name of Christ, as in the blessed Peter's words to Cornelius, when he teaches him of `Jesus of Nazareth, whom God anointed with the Holy Ghost,' and again to the Jews, `Jesus of Nazareth, a Man approved of God for you[fn-72-P7288_2891934:156-nf] ,' and again the blessed Paul to the Athenians, `By that Man, whom He ordained, giving assurance to all men, in that He raised Him from the dead[fn-72-P7289_2892112:157-nf] ' (for we find the appointment and the mission often synonymous with the anointing; from which any one who will may learn, that there is no discordance in the words of the sacred writers, but that they but give various names to the union of God the Word with the Man from Mary, sometimes as anointing, sometimes as mission, sometimes as appointment), it follows that what the blessed Peter says is right[fn-72-P7290_2892538:158-nf] , and he proclaims in purity the Godhead of the Only begotten, without separating the subsistence of God the Word from the Man from Mary (perish the thought! for how should he, who had heard in so main, ways, `I and the Father are one,' and `He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father[fn-72-P7291_2892844:159-nf] ?)' In which Man, after the resurrection also, when the doors were shut, we know of His coming to the whole band[fn-72-P7292_2892989:160-nf] of the Apostles, and dispersing all that was hard to believe in it by His words, `Handle Me and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see Me have[fn-72-P7293_2893163:161-nf] .' And He did not say, `This,' or `this Man which I have taken to Me,' but `Me.' Wherefore the Samosatene will gain no allowance, being refuted by so many arguments for the union of God the Word, nay by God the Word Himself, who now brings the news to all, and assures them by eating, and permitting to them that handling of Him which then took place. For certainly he who gives food to others, and they who give him, touch hands. For `they gave Him,' Scripture says, `a piece of a broiled fish and of an honey-comb, and' when He had `eaten before them, He took the remains and gave to them[fn-72-P7294_2893776:162-nf] ,' See now, though not as Thomas was allowed, yet by another way, He afforded to them full assurance, in being touched by them; but if you would now see the scars, learn from Thomas. `Reach hither thy hand and thrust it into My side, and reach hither thy finger and behold My hands[fn-72-P7295_2894105:163-nf] ;' so says God the Word, speaking of His own[fn-72-P7296_2894170:164-nf] side and hands, and of Himself as whole man and God together, first affording to the Saints even perception of the Word through the body[fn-72-P7297_2894333:165-nf] , as we may consider, by entering when the doors were shut; and next standing near them in the body and affording full assurance.

And so let Paul of Samosata also stand corrected on hearing the divine voice of Him who said `My body,' not `Christ besides Me who am the Word,' but `Him[fn-72-P7299_2894747:166-nf] with Me, and Me with Him.' For I the Word am the chrism, and that which has the chrism from Me is the Man[fn-73-P7300_2894894:167-nf] ; not then without Me could He be called Christ, but being with Me and I in Him. Therefore the mention of the mission of the Word shews the uniting which took place with Jesus, born of Mary, Whose Name means Saviour, not by reason of anything else, but from the Man's being made one with God the Word. This passage has the same meaning as `the Father that sent Me,' and `I came not of Myself, but the Father sent Me[fn-73-P7301_2895335:168-nf] .' For he has given the name of mission[fn-73-P7302_2895410:169-nf] to the uniting with the Man, with Whom the Invisible nature might be known to men, through the visible. For God changes not place, like us who are hidden in places, when in the fashion of our littleness He displays Himself in His existence in the flesh; for how should He, who fills the heaven and the earth? but on account of the presence in the flesh the just have spoken of His mission. Therefore God the Word Himself is Christ from Mary, God and Man; not some other Christ but One and the Same; He before ages from the Father, He too in the last times from the Virgin; invisible[fn-73-P7303_2896013:170-nf] before even to the holy powers of heaven, visible now because of His being one with the Man who is visible; seen, I say, not in His invisible Godhead but in the operation[fn-73-P7304_2896208:171-nf] of the Godhead through the human body and whole Man, which He has renewed by its appropriation to Himself. To Him be the adoration and the worship, who was before, and now is, and ever shall be, even to all ages. Amen.
