And when he descended, he preached to every man; `We know in part, and we prophesy in part; here I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known[fn-93-P9300_3375024:4-nf] .' For, in truth, he was known to those saints who are in heaven, as their fellow-citizen[fn-93-P9301_3375146:5-nf] . And in relation to all that is future and perfect, the things known by him here were in part; but with respect to those things which were committed and entrusted to him by the Lord, he was perfect; as he said, `We who are perfect, should be thus minded[fn-93-P9302_3375421:6-nf] .' For as the Gospel of Christ is the fulfilment and accomplishment of the ministration which was supplied by the law of Israel, so future things will be the accomplishment of such as now exist, the Gospel being then fulfilled, and the faithful receiving those things which, not seeing now, they yet hope for, as Paul saith; `For what a man seeth, why doth he also hope for? But if we hope for those things we see [not], we then by patience wait for them[fn-93-P9303_3375894:7-nf] .' Since then that blessed man was of such a character, and apostolic grace was committed to him, he wrote, wishing `that all men should be as he was[fn-93-P9304_3376077:8-nf] .' For virtue is philanthropic[fn-93-P9305_3376126:9-nf] , and great is the company of the kingdom of heaven, for thousands of thousands and myriads of myriads there serve the Lord. And though a man enters it through a strait and narrow way, yet having entered, he beholds immeasurable space, and a place greater than any other, as they declare, who were eye-witnesses and heirs of these things. `Thou didst place afflictions before us.' But afterwards, having related their afflictions, they say, `Thou broughtest us forth into a wide place;' and again, `In affliction Thou hast enlarged us[fn-93-P9306_3376684:10-nf] .' For truly, my brethren, the course of the saints here is straitened; since they either toil painfully through longing for those things which are to come, as he who said, `Woe is me that my pilgrimage is prolonged[fn-93-P9307_3376944:11-nf] ;' or they are distressed and spent for the salvation of other men, as Paul wrote to the Corinthians, saying, `Lest, when I come to you, God should humble me, and I should bewail many of those who have sinned already, and not repented for the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed[fn-93-P9308_3377283:12-nf] .' As Samuel bewailed the destruction of Saul, and Jeremiah wept for the captivity of the people. But after this affliction, and sorrow, and sighing, when they depart from this world, a certain divine gladness, and pleasure, and exultation receives them, from which misery and sorrow, and sighing, flee away.","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"92","code":"P9297_3374448","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Cf.

Since we are thus circumstanced, my brethren, let us never loiter in the path of virtue; for hereto he counsels us, saying, `Be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ[fn-93-P9310_3377786:13-nf] .' For he gave this advice not to the Corinthians only, since he was not their Apostle only, but being `a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity[fn-93-P9311_3377953:14-nf] ,' he admonished us all through them; and in short, the things he wrote to each particular person are commandments common to all men[fn-93-P9312_3378105:15-nf] . On this account in writing to different people, some he exhorted as, for instance, in the Epistles to the Romans, and the Ephesians, and Philemon. Some he reproved, and was indignant with them, as in the case of the Corinthians and Galatians. To some he gave advice, as to the Colossians and Thessalonians. The Philippians he approved of, and rejoiced in them. The Hebrews he taught that the law was a shadow to them[fn-93-P9313_3378568:16-nf] . But to his elect sons, Timothy and Titus, when they were near, he gave instruction; when far away, he put them in remembrance. For he was all things to all men; and being himself a perfect man, he adapted his teaching to thee need of every one, so that by all means he might rescue some of them. Therefore his word was not without fruit; but in every place it is planted and productive even to this day.","index":"4","references":[{"fn":"93","code":"P9310_3377786","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Cor. xi. 1.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"93","code":"P9311_3377953","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"1 Tim. ii. 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 timothy","chapter":2,"verses":[7]}]},{"fn":"93","code":"P9312_3378105","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Cf.

And wherefore, my beloved? For it is right that we should search into the apostolic mind. Not only in the beginning of the Epistles, but towards their close, and in the middle of them, he used persuasions and admonitions. I hope therefore that, by your prayers, I shall in no respect falsely represent the plan of that holy man. As he was well skilled in these divine matters, and knew the power of the divine teaching, he deemed it necessary, in the first place, to make known the word concerning Christ, and the mystery regarding Him; and then afterwards to point to the correction of habits, so that when they had learned to know the Lord, they might earnestly desire to do those things which He commanded. For when the Guide to the laws is unknown, one does not readily pass on to the observance of them. Faithful Moses, the minister of God, adopted this method; for when he promulgated the words of the divine dispensation of laws, he first proclaimed the matters relating to the knowledge of God: `Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one Lord[fn-93-P9315_3380059:17-nf] .' Afterwards, having shadowed Him forth to the people, and taught of Him in Whom they ought to believe, and informed their minds of Him Who is truly God, he proceeds to lay down the law relating to those things whereby a man may be well-pleasing to Him, saying, `Thou shall not commit adultery; thou shall not steal;' together with the other commandments. For also, according to the Apostolic teaching, `He that draweth near to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that seek Him[fn-93-P9316_3380583:18-nf] .' Now He is sought by means of virtuous deeds, as the prophet saith; `Seek ye the Lord, and when ye have found Him, call upon Him; when He is near to you, let the wicked forsake his ways, and the lawless man his thoughts[fn-93-P9317_3380822:19-nf] .'","index":"5","references":[{"fn":"93","code":"P9315_3380059","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Deut. vi. 4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"deuteronomy","chapter":6,"verses":[4]}]},{"fn":"93","code":"P9316_3380583","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Heb. xi. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"hebrews","chapter":11,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"93","code":"P9317_3380822","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Is. lv. 6, Is. lv. 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":55,"verses":[6]},{"book":"isaiah","chapter":55,"verses":[7]}]}]},{"text":"4. It will also be well if a man is not offended at the testimony of the Shepherd, saying in the beginning of his book, `Before all things believe that there is one God, Who created and established all these things, and from non-existence called them into beings[fn-93-P9319_3381114:20-nf] .' And, further, the blessed Evangelists-who recorded the words of the Lord-in the beginning of the Gospels, wrote the things concerning our Saviour; so that, having first made known the Lord, the Creator, they might be believed when narrating the events that took place. For how could they have been believed, when writing respecting him who [was blind] from his mother's womb, and those other blind men who recovered their sight, and those who rose from the dead, and the changing of water into wine, and those lepers who were cleansed; if they bad not taught of Him as the Creator, writing, `In the beginning was the Word[fn-93-P9320_3381759:21-nf] ?' Or, according to Matthew, that He Who was born of the seed of David, was Emmanuel, and the Son of the living God? He from Whom the Jews, with the Arians, turn away their faces, but Whom we acknowledge and worship. The Apostle therefore, as was meet, sent to different people, but his own son he especially reminded, `that he should not despise the things in which he had been instructed by him,' and enjoined on him, `Remember Jesus Christ, who rose from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my Gospel[fn-93-P9321_3382288:22-nf] .' And speaking of these things being delivered to him, to be always had in remembrance, he immediately writes to him. saying, `Meditate on these things: be engaged in them[fn-93-P9322_3382496:23-nf] ' For constant meditation, and the remembrance of divine words, strengthens piety towards God, and produces a love to Him inseparable and not merely formal[fn-93-P9323_3382672:24-nf] ; as he, being of this mind, speaks about himself and others like-minded, saying boldly, `Who shall separate us from the love of God[fn-93-P9324_3383110:25-nf] ?' For[fn-93-P9325_3383137:26-nf] such men, being confirmed in the Lord, and possessing an unshaken disposition towards Him, and being one in spirit (for[fn-93-P9326_3383432:27-nf] `he who is joined to the Spirit is one spirit'), are sure `as the mount Sion;' and although ten thousand trials may rage against them, they are founded upon a rock, which is Christ[fn-93-P9327_3383630:28-nf] . In Him the careless take no delight; and having no continuous purpose of good, they are sullied by temporal attacks, and esteem nothing more highly than present things, being unstable and deserving reproof as regards the faith. For `either the care of this world, or the deceitfulness of riches, chokes them[fn-93-P9328_3383986:29-nf] ;' or, as Jesus said in that parable which had reference to them, since they have not established the faith that has been preached to them, but continue only for a time, immediately, in time of persecution, or when affliction ariseth through the word, they are offended. Now those who meditate evil we say, [think] not truth, but falsehood and not righteousness, but iniquity, for their tongue learns to speak lies. They have done evil, and have not ceased that they might repent. For, persevering with delight in wicked actions, they hasten thereto without turning back, even treading under foot the commandment with regard to neighbours, and, instead of loving them, devise evil against them, as the saint testifies, saying, `And those who seek me evil have spoken vanity, and imagined deceit all the day[fn-93-P9329_3384814:30-nf] .' But that the cause of such meditation is none other than the want of instruction, the divine proverb has already declared; `The son that forsaketh the commandment of his father meditateth evil words[fn-93-P9330_3385038:31-nf] .' But such meditation, because it is evil, the Holy Spirit blames in these words, and reproves too in other terms, saying, `Your hands are polluted with blood, your fingers with sins; your lips have spoken lawlessness, and your tongue imagineth iniquity: no man speaketh right things, nor is there true judgment[fn-93-P9331_3385376:32-nf] .' But what the end is of such perverse imagining, He immediately declares, saying, `They trust in vanities and speak falsehood; for they conceive mischief, and bring forth lawlessness. They have hatched the eggs of an asp, and woven a spider's web; and he who is prepared to eat of their eggs, when he breaks them finds gall, and a basilisk therein[fn-93-P9332_3385755:33-nf] .' Again, what the hope of such is, He has already announced. `Because righteousness does not overtake them, when they waited for light, they had darkness; when they waited for brightness, they walked in a thick cloud. They shall grope for the wall like the blind, and as those who have no eyes shall they grope; they shall fall at noon-day as at midnight; when dead, they shall groan. They shall roar together as a bear, or as a dove[fn-93-P9333_3386210:34-nf] .'","index":"6","references":[{"fn":"93","code":"P9319_3381114","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Herm.
