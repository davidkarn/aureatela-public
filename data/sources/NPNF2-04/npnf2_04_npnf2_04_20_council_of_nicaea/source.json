What was transacted concerning ecclesiastical faith at the Great Council assembled at Nicaea, you have probably learned, Beloved, from other sources, rumour being wont to precede the accurate account of what is doing. But lest in such reports the circumstances of the case have been misrepresented, we have been obliged to transmit to you, first, the formula of faith presented by ourselves, and next, the second, which [the Fathers] put forth with some additions to our words. Our ownpaper, then, which was read in the presence of our most pious[fn-23-P2385_864760:2-nf] Emperor, and declared to be good and unexceptionable, ran thus:-","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"23","code":"P2385_864760","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"And so infr. \"most pious,\" ยง4. \"most wise and most religious,\" ibid. \"most religious,\" ยง8. ยง10.

When he came into the Nicene Council, \"it was,\" says Eusebius, \"as some heavenly Angel of God,\" iii. 10. alluding to the brilliancy of the imperial purple. He confesses, however, he diet not sit down until the Bishops bade him. Again at the same Council, \"with pleasant eyes looking serenity itself into them all, collecting himself, and in a quiet and gentle voice\" he made an oration to the Fathers upon peace. Constantine had been an instrument in conferring such vast benefits, humanly speaking, on the Christian Body, that it is not wonderful that other writers of the day besides Eusebius should praise him. Hilary speaks of him as \"of sacred memory,\" Fragm. v. init. Athanasius calls him \"most pious,\" Apol. contr. Arian. 9; \"of blessed memory,\" ad Ep. Aeg. 18. 19.

On this faith being publicly put forth by us, no room for contradiction appeared; but our most pious Emperor, before any one else, testified that it comprised most orthodox statements. He confessed moreover that such were his own sentiments, and he advised all present to agree to it, and to subscribe its articles and to assent to them, with the insertion of the single word, One-in-essence, which moreover he interpreted as not in the sense of the affections of bodies, nor as if the Son subsisted from the Father in the way of division, or any severance; for that the immaterial, and intellectual, and incorporeal nature could not be the subject of any corporeal affection, but that it became us to conceive of such things in a divine and ineffable manner.

And they professed, that the phrase \"of the essence\" was indicative of the Son's being indeed from the Father, yet without being as if a part of Him. And with this understanding we thought good to assent to the sense of such religious doctrine, teaching, as it did, that the Son was from the Father, not however a part of His essence[fn-23-P2399_872574:7-nf] .
