Introductory.—The\nSubject of This Treatise: the Humiliation and Incarnation of the Word.\nPresupposes the Doctrine of Creation, and that by the Word. The Father Has\nSaved the World by Him Through Whom He First Made It.","index":"2","references":[]},{"text":"Whereas in\nwhat precedes we hav drawn out—choosing a few points from among many—a\nsufficient account of the error of the heathen concerning idols, and of the\nworship of idols, and how they originally came to be invented; how, namely, out\nof wickedness men devised for themselves the worshipping of idols: and whereas\nwe have by God’s grace noted somewhat also of the divinity of the Word of the\nFather, and of His universal Providence and power, and that the Good Father\nthrough Him orders all things, and all things are moved by Him, and in Him are\nquickened: come now, Macarius1 (worthy\nof that name), and true lover of Christ, let us follow up the faith of our\nreligion2 , and set forth also what relates to the\nWord’s becoming Man, and to His divine Appearing amongst us, which Jews traduce\nand Greeks laugh to scorn, but we worship; in order that, all the more for the\nseeming low estate of the Word, your piety toward Him may be increased and\nmultiplied. 2. For the more He is mocked among the unbelieving, the more\nwitness does He give of His own Godhead; inasmuch as He not only Himself\ndemonstrates as possible what then mistake, thinking impossible, but what men\nderide as unseemly, this by His own goodness He clothes with seemliness, and\nwhat men, in their conceit of wisdom, laugh at as merely human, He by His own\npower demonstrates to be divine, subduing the pretensions of idols by His\nsupposed humiliation—by the Cross—and those who mock and disbelieve invisibly winning\nover to recognise His divinity and power. 3. But to treat this subject it is\nnecessary to recall what has been previously said; in order that you may\nneither fail to know the cause of the bodily appearing of the Word of the\nFather, so high and so great, nor think it a consequence of His own nature that\nthe Saviour has worn a body; but that being incorporeal by nature, and Word\nfrom the beginning, He has yet of the loving-kindness and goodness of His own\nFather been manifested to us in a human body for our salvation. 4. It is, then,\nproper for us to begin the treatment of this subject by speaking of the\ncreation of the universe, and of God its Artificer, that so it may be duly\nperceived that the renewal of creation has been the work of the self-same Word\nthat made it at the beginning. For it will appear not inconsonant for the\nFather to have wrought its salvation in Him by Whose means He made it.","index":"3","references":[]},{"text":"�2. Erroneous Views\nof Creation Rejected.

For some say that all things have come into being of themselves,\nand in a chance fashion; as, for example, the Epicureans, who tell us in their self-contempt,\nthat universal providence does not exist speaking right in the face of obvious\nfact and experience. 2. For if, as they say, everything has had its beginning\nof itself, and independently of purpose, it would follow that everything had\ncome into3 mere being, so as to be alike and not\ndistinct. For it would follow in virtue of the unity of body that everything\nmust be sun or moon, and in the case of men it would follow that the whole must\nbe hand, or eye, or foot. But as it is this is not so. On the contrary, we see\na distinction of sun, moon, and earth; and again, in the case of human bodies,\nof foot, hand, and head. Now, such separate arrangement as this tells us not of\ntheir having come into being of themselves, but shews that a cause preceded\nthem; from which cause it is possible to apprehend God also as the Maker and\nOrderer of all.","index":"5","references":[]},{"text":"3. But others, including Plato, who is in such repute\namong the Greeks, argue that God has made the world out of matter previously\nexisting and without beginning. For God could have made nothing had not the\nmaterial existed already; just as the wood must exist ready at hand for the\ncarpenter, to enable him to work at all. 4. But in so saying they know not that\nthey are investing God with weakness. For if He is not Himself the cause of the\nmaterial, but makes things only of previously existing material, He proves to\nbe weak, because unable to produce anything He makes without the material; just\nas it is without doubt a weakness of the carpenter not to be able to make\nanything required without his timber. For, ex hypothesi, had not the\nmaterial existed, God would not have made anything. And how could He in that\ncase be called Maker and Artificer, if He owes His ability to make to some\nother source—namely, to the material? So that if this be so, God will be on\ntheir theory a Mechanic only, and not a Creator out of nothing4 ; if, that is, He works at existing\nmaterial, but is not Himself the cause of the material. For He could not in any\nsense be called Creator unless He is Creator of the material of which the\nthings created have in their turn been made. 5. But the sectaries imagine to\nthemselves a different artificer of all things, other than the Father of our\nLord Jesus Christ, in deep blindness even as to the words they use. 6. For\nwhereas the Lord says to the Jews5 : “Have\nye not read that from the beginning He which created them made them male and\nfemale, and said, For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and\nshall cleave to his wife, and they twain shall become one flesh?” and then,\nreferring to the Creator, says, “What, therefore, God hath joined together let not man put asunder:” how come\nthese men to assert that the creation is independent of the Father? Or if, in\nthe words of John, who says, making no exception, “All things6 were made by Him,” and “without Him was\nnot anything made,” how could the artificer be another, distinct from the\nFather of Christ?","index":"6","references":[]},{"text":"�3.

But the godly teaching and\nthe faith according to Christ brands their foolish language as godlessness. For\nit knows that it was not spontaneously, because forethought is not absent; nor\nof existing matter, because God is not weak; but that out of nothing, and\nwithout its having any previous existence, God made the universe to exist\nthrough His word, as He says firstly through Moses: “In7\nthe beginning God created the heaven and the earth;” secondly, in the most\nedifying book of the Shepherd, “First8\nof all believe that God is one, which created and framed all things, and made\nthem to exist out of nothing.” 2. To which also Paul refers when he says, “By9 faith we understand that the worlds have\nbeen framed by the Word of God, so that what is seen hath not been made out of\nthings which do appear.” 3. For God is good, or rather is essentially the\nsource of goodness: nor10\ncould one that is good be niggardly of anything: whence, grudging existence to\nnone, He has made all things out of nothing by His own Word, Jesus Christ our\nLord. And among these, having taken especial pity, above all things on earth,\nupon the race of men, and having perceived its inability, by virtue of the\ncondition of its origin, to continue in one stay, He gave them a further gift,\nand He did not barely create man, as He did all the irrational creatures on the\nearth, but made them after His own image, giving them a portion even of the\npower of His own Word; so that having as it were a kind of reflexion of the\nWord, and being made rational, they might be able to abide ever in blessedness,\nliving the true life which belongs to the saints in paradise. 4. But knowing\nonce more how the will of man could sway to either side, in anticipation He\nsecured the grace given them by a law and by the spot where He placed them. For\nHe brought them into His own garden, and gave them a law: so that, if they kept\nthe grace and remained good, they might still keep the life in paradise without\nsorrow or pain or care besides having the promise of incorruption in heaven;\nbut that if they transgressed and turned back, and became evil, they might know\nthat they were incurring that corruption in death which was theirs by nature:\nno longer to live in paradise, but cast out of it from that time forth to die\nand to abide in death and in corruption. 5. Now this is that of which Holy Writ\nalso gives warning, saying in the Person of God: “Of every tree11 that is in the garden, eating thou\nshalt eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, ye shall not eat\nof it, but on the day that ye eat, dying ye shall die.” But by “dying ye shall\ndie,” what else could be meant than not dying merely, but also abiding ever in\nthe corruption of death?","index":"8","references":[]},{"text":"�4.

But this, too, properly belongs to the aim\nof our treatise.","index":"10","references":[]},{"text":"2. For in speaking of the appearance of the Saviour\namongst us, we must needs speak also of the origin of men, that you may know\nthat the reason of His coming down was because of us, and that our\ntransgression12\ncalled forth the loving-kindness of the Word, that the Lord should both make\nhaste to help us and appear among men. 3. For of His becoming Incarnate we were\nthe object, and for our salvation He dealt so lovingly as to appear and be born\neven in a human body. 4. Thus, then, God has made man, and willed that he\nshould abide in incorruption; but men, having despised and rejected the\ncontemplation of God, and devised and contrived evil for themselves (as was\nsaid13 in the former\ntreatise), received the condemnation of death with which they had been\nthreatened; and from thenceforth no longer remained as they were made, but14 were being corrupted according to\ntheir devices; and death had the mastery over them as king15 . For transgression of the\ncommandment was turning them back to their natural state, so that just as they\nhave had their being out of nothing, so also, as might be expected, they might\nlook for corruption into nothing in the course of time.","index":"11","references":[]},{"text":"5. For if, out of a former normal state of\nnonexistence, they were called into being by the Presence and loving-kindness\nof the Word, it followed naturally that when men were bereft of the knowledge\nof God and were turned back to what was not (for what is evil is not, but what\nis good is), they should, since they derive their being from God who IS, be\neverlastingly bereft even of being; in other words, that they should be\ndisintegrated and abide in death and corruption. 6. For man is by nature\nmortal, inasmuch as he is made out of what is not; but by reason of his\nlikeness to Him that is (and if he still preserved this likeness by keeping Him\nin his knowledge) he would stay his natural corruption, and remain incorrupt;\nas Wisdom16 says: “The taking\nheed to His laws is the assurance of immortality;” but being incorrupt, he\nwould live henceforth as God, to which I suppose the divine Scripture refers,\nwhen it says: “I have17\nsaid ye are gods, and ye are all sons of the most Highest; but ye die like men,\nand fall as one of the princes.”�5. For God has not only made us out of\nnothing; but He gave us freely, by the Grace of the Word, a life in\ncorrespondence with God. But men, having rejected things eternal, and, by counsel\nof the devil, turned to the things of corruption, became the cause18 of their own corruption in\ndeath, being, as I said before, by nature corruptible, but destined, by the\ngrace following from partaking of the Word, to have escaped their natural state,\nhad they remained good. 2. For because of the Word dwelling with them, even\ntheir natural corruption did not come near them, as Wisdom also says19 : “God made man for\nincorruption, and as an image of His own eternity; but by envy of the devil\ndeath came into the world.” But when this was come to pass, men began to die,\nwhile corruption thence-forward prevailed against them, gaining even more than\nits natural power over the whole race, inasmuch as it had, owing to the\ntransgression of the commandment, the threat of the Deity as a further\nadvantage against them.","index":"12","references":[]},{"text":"3. For even in their misdeeds men had not stopped\nshort at any set limits ; but gradually pressing forward, have passed on beyond\nall measure: having to begin with been inventors of wickedness and called down\nupon themselves death and corruption; while later on, having turned aside to\nwrong and exceeding all lawlessness, and stopping at no one evil but devising\nall manner of new evils in succession, they have become insatiable in sinning.\n4. For there were adulteries everywhere and thefts, and the whole earth was\nfull of murders and plunderings. And as to corruption and wrong, no heed was\npaid to law, but all crimes were being practised everywhere, both individually\nand jointly. Cities were at war with cities, and nations were rising up against\nnations; and the whole earth was rent with civil commotions and battles; each\nman vying with his fellows in lawless deeds. 8. Nor were even crimes against\nnature far from them, but, as the Apostle and witness of Christ says: “For\ntheir20 women changed the\nnatural use into that which is against nature: and likewise also the men,\nleaving the natural use of the women, burned in their lust one toward another,\nmen with men working unseemliness, and receiving in themselves that recompense\nof their error which was meet.”","index":"13","references":[]},{"text":"�6.

For death, as I said above, gained from that time forth a\nlegal21 hold over us, and\nit was impossible to evade the law, since it had been laid down by God because22 of the transgression, and the\nresult was in truth at once monstrous and unseemly. 3. For it were monstrous,\nfirstly, that God, having spoken, should prove false— that, when once He had\nordained that man, if he transgressed the commandment, should die the death,\nafter the transgression man should not die, but God’s word should be broken.\nFor God would not be true, if, when He had said we should die, man died not. 4.\nAgain, it were unseemly that creatures once made rational, and having partaken\nof the Word, should go to ruin, and turn again toward non-existence by the way\nof corruption23 .\n5. For it were not worthy of God’s goodness that the things He had made should\nwaste away, because of the deceit practised on men by the devil. 6.

For neglect reveals\nweakness, and not goodness on God’s part—if, that is, He allows His own work to\nbe ruined when once He had made it—more so than if He had never made man at\nall. 9. For if He had not made them, none could impute weakness; but once He\nhad made them, and created them out of nothing, it were most monstrous for the\nwork to be ruined, and that before the eyes of the Maker. 10.

To demand repentance of men for their transgression?\nFor this one might pronounce worthy of God; as though, just as from\ntransgression men have become set towards corruption, so from repentance they\nmay once more be set in the way of incorruption. 3. But repentance would,\nfirstly, fail to guard the just claim25\nof God. For He would still be none the more true, if men did not remain in the\ngrasp of death; nor, secondly, does repentance call men back from what is their\nnature—it merely stays them from acts of sin. 4. Now, if there were merely a\nmisdemeanour in question, and not a consequent corruption, repentance were well\nenough. But if, when transgression had once gained a start, men became involved\nin that corruption which was their nature, and were deprived of the grace which\nthey had, being in the image of God, what further step was needed? or what was required\nfor such grace and such recall, but the Word of God, which had also at the\nbeginning made everything out of nought?","index":"18","references":[]},{"text":"5.

But He comes in condescension to shew loving-kindness upon us,\nand to visit us. 2. And seeing the race of rational creatures in the way to\nperish, and death reigning over them by corruption; seeing, too, that the\nthreat against transgression gave a firm hold to the corruption which was upon\nus, and that it was monstrous that28\nbefore the law was fulfilled it should fall through: seeing, once more, the\nunseemliness of what was come to pass: that the things whereof He Himself was\nArtificer were passing away: seeing, further, the exceeding wickedness of men,\nand how by little and little they had increased it to an intolerable pitch\nagainst themselves: and seeing, lastly, how all men were under penalty of\ndeath: He took pity on our race, and had mercy on our infirmity, and\ncondescended to our corruption, and, unable to bear that death should have the\nmastery—lest the creature should perish, and His Father’s handiwork in men be\nspent for nought—He takes unto Himself a body, and that of no different sort\nfrom ours. 3. For He did not simply will to become embodied, or will merely to\nappear29 . For if He willed\nmerely to appear, He was able to effect His divine appearance by some other and\nhigher means as well.

Whence, by offering unto death the body He Himself\nhad taken, as an offering and sacrifice free from any stain, straightway He put\naway death from all His peers by the offering of an equivalent. 2. For being\nover all, the Word of God naturally by offering His own temple and corporeal\ninstrument for the life33 of\nall satisfied the debt by His death.

And of this one may be assured at the hands of the\nSaviour’s own inspired writers, if one happen upon their writings, where they\nsay: “For the love of Christ36\nconstraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then all\ndied, and He died for all that we should no longer live unto ourselves, but\nunto Him Who for our sakes died and rose again,” our Lord Jesus Christ. And,\nagain: “But37 we behold Him, Who\nhath been made a little lower than the angels, even Jesus, because of the\nsuffering of death crowned with glory and honour, that by the grace of God He\nshould taste of death for every man.” 3. Then He also points out the reason why\nit was necessary for none other than God the Word Himself to become incarnate;\nas follows: “For it became Him, for Whom are all things, and through Whom are\nall things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their\nsalvation perfect through suffering;” by which words He means, that it belonged\nto none other to bring man back from the corruption which had begun, than the\nWord of God, Who had also made them from the beginning. 4. And that it was in\norder to the sacrifice for bodies such as His own that the Word Himself also\nassumed a body, to this, also, they refer in these words38 : “Forasmuch then as the children\nare the sharers in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of\nthe same, that through death He might bring to naught Him that had the power of\ndeath, that is, the devil; and might deliver them who, through fear of death,\nwere all their lifetime subject to bondage.” 5. For by the sacrifice of His own\nbody, He both put an end to the law which was against us, and made a new\nbeginning of life for us, by the hope of resurrection which He has given us.\nFor since from man it was that death prevailed over men, for this cause\nconversely, by the Word of God being made man has come about the destruction of\ndeath and the resurrection of life; as the man which bore Christ39 saith: “For40 since by man came death, by man\ncame also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in\nChrist shall all be made alive :” and so forth.

For not only did they grave\nidols for themselves, instead of the truth, and honour things that were not\nbefore the living God, “and43\nserve the creature rather than the Creator,” but, worst of all, they\ntransferred the honour of God even to stocks and stones and to every material\nobject and to men, and went even further than this, as we have said in the\nformer treatise. 5. So far indeed did their impiety go, that they proceeded to\nworship devils, and proclaimed them as gods, fulfilling their own44 lusts. For they performed, as was\nsaid above, offerings of brute animals, and sacrifices of men, as was meet for\nthem45 , binding\nthemselves down all the faster under their maddening inspirations. 6. For this\nreason it was also that magic arts were taught among them, and oracles in divers\nplaces led men astray, and all men ascribed the influences of their birth and\nexistence to the stars and to all the heavenly bodies, having no thought of\nanything beyond what was visible. 7. And, in a word, everything was full of\nirreligion and lawlessness, and God alone, and His Word, was unknown, albeit He\nhad not hidden Himself out of men’s sight, nor given the knowledge of Himself\nin one way only; but had, on the contrary, unfolded it to them in many forms\nand by many ways.","index":"30","references":[]},{"text":"�12.

But these things are said of Him, because the actual\nbody which ate, was born, and suffered, belonged to none other but to the Lord:\nand because, having become man, it was proper for these things to be predicated\nof Him as man, to shew Him to have a body in truth, and not in seeming. 2. But\njust as from these things He was known to be bodily present, so from the works\nHe did in the body He made Himself known to be Son of God. Whence also He cried\nto the unbelieving Jews; “If60 I\ndo not the works of My Father, believe Me not. But if I do them, though ye\nbelieve not Me, believe My works; that ye may know and understand that the\nFather is in Me, and I in the Father.” 3.

For His charging evil spirits, and their\nbeing driven forth, this deed is not of man, but of God. Or who that saw Him\nhealing the diseases to which the human race is subject, can still think Him\nman and not God? For He cleansed lepers, made lame men to walk, opened the\nhearing of deaf men, made blind men to see again, and in a word drove away from\nmen all diseases and infirmities: from which acts it was possible even for the\nmost ordinary observer to see His Godhead.

Now\nlet such an one be told that this too was unbefitting the Lord. For as it was\nnot fitting for the Word of God, being the Life, to inflict death Himself on\nHis own body, so neither was it suitable to fly from death offered by others,\nbut rather to follow it up unto destruction, for which reason He naturally\nneither laid aside His body of His own accord, nor, again, fled from the Jews\nwhen they took counsel against Him. 2. But this did not shew weakness on the\nWord’s part, but, on the contrary, shewed Him to be Saviour and Life; in that He\nboth awaited death to destroy it, and hasted to accomplish the death offered\nHim for the salvation of all. 3. And besides, the Saviour came to accomplish\nnot His own death, but the death of men; whence He did not lay aside His body\nby a death of His own69 —\nfor He was Life and had none—but received that death which came from men, in\norder perfectly to do away with this when it met Him in His own body. 4. Again,\nfrom the following also one might see the reasonableness of the Lord’s body\nmeeting this end. The Lord was especially concerned for the resurrection of the\nbody which He was set to accomplish. For what He was to do was to manifest it\nas a monument of victory over death, and to assure all of His having effected\nthe blotting out of corruption, and of the incorruption of their bodies from\nthenceforward; as a gage of which and a proof of the resurrection in store for\nall, He has preserved His own body incorrupt. 5. If, then, once more, His body\nhad fallen sick, and the word had been sundered from it in the sight of all, it\nwould have been unbecoming that He who healed the diseases of others should\nsuffer His own instrument to waste in sickness. For how could His driving out\nthe diseases of others have been believed70\nin if His own temple fell sick in Him71\n? For either He had been mocked as unable to drive away diseases, or if He\ncould, but did not, He would be thought insensible toward others also.","index":"61","references":[]},{"text":"�23.

Now, death must precede resurrection, as\nit would be no resurrection did not death precede; so that if the death of His\nbody had taken place anywhere in secret, the death not being apparent nor\ntaking place before witnesses, His Resurrection too had been hidden and without\nevidence. 2. Or why, while when He had risen He proclaimed the Resurrection,\nshould He cause His death to take place in secret? or why, while He drove out\nevil spirits in the presence of all, and made the man blind from his birth\nrecover his sight, and changed the water into wine, that by these means He\nmight be believed to be the Word of God, should He not manifest His mortal\nnature as incorruptible in the presence of all, that He might be believed\nHimself to be the Life? 3.

But had He done even this, He would give ground for\nsuspicion against Himself, that He was not powerful against every death, but\nonly against the death devised for74\nHim; and so again there would have been a pretext for disbelief about the\nResurrection all the same. So death came to His body, not from Himself, but\nfrom hostile counsels, in order that whatever death they offered to the\nSaviour, this He might utterly do away. 3. And just as a noble wrestler, great\nin skill and courage, does not pick out his antagonists for himself, lest he\nshould raise a suspicion of his being afraid of some of them, but puts it in\nthe choice of the onlookers, and especially so if they happen to be his\nenemies, so that against whomsoever they match him, him he may throw, and be\nbelieved superior to them all; so also the Life of all, our Lord and Saviour,\neven Christ, did not devise a death for His own body, so as not to appear to be\nfearing some other death; but He accepted on the Cross, and endured, a death\ninflicted by others, and above all by His enemies, which they thought dreadful\nand ignominious and not to be faced; so that this also being destroyed, both He\nHimself might be believed to be the Life, and the power of death be brought\nutterly to nought. 4. So something surprising and startling has happened; for\nthe death, which they thought to inflict as a disgrace, was actually a monument\nof victory against death itself. Whence neither did He suffer the death of\nJohn, his head being severed, nor, as Esaias, was He sawn in sunder; in order\nthat even in death He might still keep His body undivided and in perfect\nsoundness, and no pretext be afforded to those that would divide the Church.","index":"65","references":[]},{"text":"�25.

For this is exactly\nwhat is written: “Cursed76 is\nhe that hangeth on a tree.” 3. Again, if the Lord’s death is the ransom of all,\nand by His death “the middle77\nwall of partition” is broken down, and the calling of the nations is brought\nabout, how would He have called us to Him, had He not been crucified? For it is\nonly on the cross that a man dies with his hands spread out. Whence it was\nfitting for the Lord to bear this also and to spread out His hands, that with\nthe one He might draw the ancient people, and with the other those from the\nGentiles, and unite both in Himself. 4. For this is what He Himself has said,\nsignifying by what manner of death He was to ransom all: “I, when78 I am lifted up,” He saith, “shall\ndraw all men unto Me.” 5. And once more, if the devil, the enemy of our race,\nhaving fallen from heaven, wanders about our lower atmosphere, and there\nbearing rule over his fellow-spirits, as his peers in disobedience, not only\nworks illusions by their means in them that are deceived, but tries to hinder\nthem that are going up (and about this79\nthe Apostle says: “According to the prince of the power of the air, of the\nspirit that now worketh in the sons of disobedience”); while the Lord came to\ncast down the devil, and clear the air and prepare the way for us up into\nheaven, as said the Apostle: “Through80\nthe veil, that is to say, His flesh”—and this must needs be by death—well, by\nwhat other kind of death could this have come to pass, than by one which took\nplace in the air, I mean the cross? for only he that is perfected on the cross\ndies in the air. Whence it was quite fitting that the Lord suffered this death.\n6. For thus being lifted up He cleared the air81 of the malignity both of the devil\nand of demons of all kinds, as He says: “I beheld82 Satan as lightning fall from\nheaven;” and made a new opening of the way up into heaven as He says once more:\n“Lift83 up your gates, O ye\nprinces, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors.” For it was not the Word\nHimself that needed an opening of the gates, being Lord of all; nor were any of\nHis works closed to their Maker; but we it was that needed it whom He carried\nup by His own body.

For not even thus—not even on the Cross—did\nHe leave Himself concealed; but far otherwise, while He made creation witness\nto the presence of its Maker, He suffered not the temple of His body to remain\nlong, but having merely shewn it to be dead, by the contact of death with it,\nHe straightway raised it up on the third day, bearing away, as the mark of\nvictory and the triumph over death, the incorruptibility and impassibility\nwhich resulted to His body. 2. For He could, even immediately on death, have\nraised His body and shewn it alive; but this also the Saviour, in wise\nforesight, did not do.

Perhaps, again, had the interval of His dying and\nrising again been one of two days84\nonly, the glory of His incorruption would have been obscure.

But Moses, the truly great, and whom they believe\nto speak truth, with reference to the Saviour’s becoming man, having estimated\nwhat was said as important, and assured of its truth, set it down in these\nwords: “There92\nshall rise a star out of Jacob, and a man out of Israel, and he shall break in\npieces the captains of Moab.” And again: “How lovely are thy habitations O\nJacob, thy tabernacles O Israel, as shadowing gardens, and as parks by the\nrivers, and as tabernacles which the Lord hath fixed, as cedars by the waters.\nA man shall come forth out of his seed, and shall be Lord over many peoples.”\nAnd again, Esaias: “Before93\nthe Child know how to call father or mother, he shall take the power of\nDamascus and the spoils of Samaria before the king of Assyria.”","index":"90","references":[]},{"text":"5.

They say then: “A man96\nin stripes, and knowing how to bear weakness, for his face is turned away: he\nwas dishonoured and held in no account. He beareth our sins, and is in pain on\nour account; and we reckoned him to be in labour, and in stripes, and in\nill-usage; but he was wounded for our sins, and made weak for our wickedness.\nThe chastisement of our peace was upon him, and by his stripes we were healed.”\nO marvel at the loving-kindness of the Word, that for our sakes He is\ndishonoured, that we may be brought to honour. “For all we,” it says, “like\nsheep were gone astray; man had erred in his way; and the Lord delivered him\nfor our sins; and he openeth not his mouth, because he hath been evilly\nentreated.

And next, the prophets after him witness of\nthis, saying: “But101 I\nas an innocent lamb brought to be slain, knew it not; they counselled an evil\ncounsel against me, saying, Hither and let us cast a tree upon his102 bread, and efface him from the\nland of the living.” 4.

Now a death raised aloft and that takes place on a tree,\ncould be none other than the Cross: and again, in no other death are the hands\nand feet pierced, save on the Cross only. 6. But since by the sojourn of the\nSaviour among men all nations also on every side began to know God; they did\nnot leave this point, either, without a reference but mention is made of this\nmatter as well in the Holy Scriptures. For “there104 a shall be,” he saith, “the root\nof Jesse, and he that riseth to rule the nations, on him shall the nations\nhope.” This then is a little in proof of what has happened. 7. But all\nScripture teems with refutations of the disbelief of the Jews. For which of the\nrighteous men and holy prophets, and patriarchs, recorded in the divine\nScriptures, ever had his corporal birth of a virgin only? Or what woman has\nsufficed without man for the conception of human kind? Was not Abel born of\nAdam, Enoch of Jared, Noe of Lamech, and Abraham of Tharra, Isaac of Abraham,\nJacob of Isaac? Was not Judas born of Jacob, and Moses and Aaron of Ameram? Was\nnot Samuel born of Elkana, was not David of Jesse, was not Solomon of David,\nwas not Ezechias of Achaz, was not Josias of Amos, was not Esaias of Amos, was\nnot Jeremy of Chelchias, was not Ezechiel of Buzi? Had not each a father as\nauthor of his existence? Who then is he that is born of a virgin only? For the\nprophet made exceeding much of this sign. 8. Or whose birth did a star in the\nskies forerun, to announce to the world him that was born? For when Moses was\nborn, he was hid by his parents: David was not heard of, even by those of his\nneighbourhood, inasmuch as even the great Samuel knew him not, but asked, had\nJesse yet another son?

Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall\nhear; then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the stammerers\nshall be plain.” 4. Now what can they say to this, or how can they dare to face\nthis at all? For the prophecy not only indicates that God is to sojourn here,\nbut it announces the signs and the time of His coming. For they connect the\nblind recovering their sight, and the lame walking, and the deaf hearing, and\nthe tongue of the stammerers being made plain, with the Divine Coming which is\nto take place.

For when did prophet and vision\ncease from Israel, save when Christ came, the Holy of Holies? For it is a sign,\nand an important proof, of the coming of the Word of God, that Jerusalem no\nlonger stands, nor is any prophet raised up nor vision revealed to them,—and\nthat very naturally. 2. For when He that was signified was come, what need was\nthere any longer of any to signify Him? When the truth was there, what need any\nmore of the shadow? For this was the reason of their prophesying at\nall,—namely, till the true Righteousness should come, and He that was to ransom\nthe sins of all. And this was why Jerusalem stood till then- namely, that there\nthey might be exercised in the types as a preparation for the reality. 3. So\nwhen the Holy of Holies was come, naturally vision and prophecy were sealed and\nthe kingdom of Jerusalem ceased. For kings were to be anointed among them only\nuntil the Holy of Holies should have been anointed; and Jacob prophesies that\nthe kingdom of the Jews should be established until Him, as follows :—“The\nruler114 shall not fail from\nJuda, nor the Prince from his loins, until that which islaid up for him shall come;\nand he is the expectation of the nations.” 4. Whence the Saviour also Himself\ncried aloud and said: “The115\nlaw and the prophets prophesied until John.” If then there is now among the\nJews king or prophet or vision, they do well to deny the Christ that is come.\nBut if there is neither king nor vision, but from that time forth all prophecy\nis sealed and the city and temple taken, why are they so irreligious and so\nperverse as to see what has happened, and yet to deny Christ, Who has brought\nit all to pass? Or why, when they see even heathens deserting their idols, and\nplacing their hope, through Christ, on the God of Israel, do they deny Christ,\nWho was born of the root of Jesse after the flesh and henceforth is King? For\nif the nations were worshipping some other God, and not confessing the God of\nAbraham and Isaac and Jacob and Moses, then, once more, they would be doing\nwell in alleging that God hadnot come. 5. But if the Gentiles are honouring the\nsame God that gave the law to Moses and made the promise to Abraham, and Whose\nword the Jews dishonoured,—why are they ignorant, or rather why do they choose\nto ignore, that the Lord foretold by the Scriptures has shone forth upon the\nworld, and appeared to it in bodily form, as the Scripture said: “The116 Lord God hath shined upon us;” and\nagain: “He117\nsent His Word and healed them ;” and again: “Not118 a messenger, not an angel, but the\nLord Himself saved them?” 6. Their state may be compared to that of one out of\nhis right mind, who sees the earth illumined by the sun, but denies the sun\nthat illumines it. For what more is there for him whom they expect to do, when\nhe is come? To call the heathen? But they are called already. To make prophecy,\nand king, and vision to cease? This too has already come to pass. To expose the\ngodlessness of idolatry? It is already exposed and condemned. Or to destroy\ndeath? He is already destroyed. 7. What then has not come to pass, that the\nChrist must do? What is left unfulfilled, that the Jews should now disbelieve\nwith impunity? For if, I say,—which is just what we actually see,—there is no\nlonger king nor prophet nor Jerusalem nor sacrifice nor vision among them, but\neven the whole earth is filled with the knowledge of God, and gentiles, leaving\ntheir godlessness, are now taking refuge with the God of Abraham, through the\nWord, even our Lord Jesus Christ, then it must be plain, even to those whoare\nexceedingly obstinate, that the Christ is come, and that He has illumined\nabsolutely all with His light, and given them the true and divine teaching\nconcerning His Father.","index":"111","references":[]},{"text":"8.

For just as He is in creation, and yet does not partake of its nature\nin the least degree, but rather all things partake127 of His power; so while He used the\nbody as His instrument He partook of no corporeal property, but, on the\ncontrary, Himself sanctified even the body. 7. For if even Plato, who is in\nsuch repute among the Greeks, says128\nthat its author, beholding the universe tempest-tossed, and in peril of going\ndown to the place of chaos, takes his seat at the helm of the soul and comes to\nthe rescue and corrects all its calamities; what is there incredible in what we\nsay, that, mankind being in error, the Word lighted down129 upon it and appeared as man, that\nHe might save it in its tempest by His guidance and goodness?","index":"122","references":[]},{"text":"�44.

To this objection of theirs a reasonable\nanswer would be: that formerly, nothing being in existence at all, what was\nneeded to make everything was a fiat and the bare will to do so. But when man\nhad once been made, and necessity demanded a cure, not for things that were\nnot, but for things that had come to be, it was naturally consequent that the\nPhysician and Saviour should appear in what had come to be, in order also to\ncurethe things that were. For this cause, then, He has become man, and used His\nbody as a human instrument. 3. For if this were not the right way, how was the\nWord, choosing to use an instrument, to appear? or whence was He to take it,\nsave from those already in being, and in need of His Godhead by means of one\nlike themselves? For it was not things without being that needed salvation, so\nthat a bare command should suffice, but man, already in existence, was going to\ncorruption and ruin131 .\nIt was then natural and right that the Word should use a human instrument and\nreveal Himself everywhither. 4. Secondly, you must know this also, that the\ncorruption which had set in was not external to the body, but had become\nattached to it; and it was required that, instead of corruption, life should\ncleave to it; so that, just as death has been engendered in the body, so life\nmay be engendered in it also. 5. Now if death were external to the body, it\nwould be proper for life also to have been engendered externally to it. But if\ndeath was wound closely to the body and was ruling over it as though united to\nit, it was required that life also should be would closely to the body, that so\nthe body, by putting on life in its stead, should cast off corruption. Besides,\neven supposing that the Word had come outside the body, and not in it, death\nwould indeed have been defeated by Him, in perfect accordance with nature,\ninasmuch as death has no power against the Life; but the corruption attached to\nthe body would have remained in it none the less132 . 6. For this cause the Saviour\nreasonably put on Him a body, in order that the body, becoming wound closely to\nthe Life, should no longer, as mortal, abide in death, but, as having put on\nimmortality, should thenceforth rise again and remain immortal. For, once it\nhad put on corruption, it could not have risen again unless it had put on life.\nAnd death likewise could not, from its very nature, appear, save in the body.\nTherefore He put on a body, that He might find death in the body, and blot it\nout. For how could the Lord have been proved at all to be the Life, had He not\nquickened what was mortal? 7. And just as, whereas stubble is naturally\ndestructible by fire, supposing (firstly) a man keeps fire away from the\nstubble, though it is not burned, yet the stubble remains, for all that, merely\nstubble, fearing the threat of the fire—for fire has the natural property of\nconsuming it; while if a man (secondly) encloses it with a quantity of\nasbestos, the substance said133\nto be an antidote to fire, the stubble no longer dreads the fire, being secured\nby its enclosure in incombustible matter; 8. in this very way one may say, with\nregard to the body and death, that if death had been kept from the body by a\nmere command on His part, it would none the less have been mortal and\ncorruptible, according to the nature of bodies; but, that this should not be,\nit put on the incorporeal Word of God, and thus no longer fears either death or\ncorruption, for it has life as a garment, and corruption is done away in it.","index":"124","references":[]},{"text":"�45.

For I resume, and repeat what I said before, that the\nSaviour did this in order that, as He fills all things on all sides by His\npresence, so also He might fill all things with the knowledge of Him, as the\ndivine Scripture also says134\n: “The whole earth was filled with the knowledge of the Lord.” 3.

Or\nif a man is gone astray among demons, and is in fear of them, he may see this\nman drive them out, and make up his mind that He is their Master. Or if a man\nhas sunk to the waters135 ,\nand thinks that they are God,-as the Egyptians, for instance, reverence the\nwater, —he may see its nature changed by Him,and learn that the Lord is Creator\nof the waters. 4.

For the Lord touched all parts\nof creation, and freed and undeceived all of them from every illusion; as Paul\nsays: “Having136\nput off from Himself the principalities and the powers, He triumphed on the\nCross :” that no one might by any possibility be any longer deceived, but\neverywhere might find the true Word of God. 6. For thus man, shut in on every\nside137 , and beholding the\ndivinity of the Word unfolded everywhere, that is, in heaven, in Hades, in man,\nupon earth, is no longer exposed to deceit concerning God, but is to worship\nChrist alone, and through Him come rightly to know the Father. 7.

And\nto sum the matter up: behold how the Saviour’s doctrine is everywhere\nincreasing, while all idolatry and everything opposed to the faith of Christ is\ndaily dwindling, and losing power, and falling. And thus beholding, worship the\nSaviour, “Who is above all” and mighty, even God the Word; and condemn those\nwho are being worsted and done away by Him. 3. For as, when the sun is come,\ndarkness no longer prevails, but if any be still left anywhere it is driven\naway; so, now that the divine Appearing of the Word of God is come, the\ndarkness of the idols prevails no more, and all parts of the world in every\ndirection are illumined by His teaching. 4. And as, when a king is reigning in\nsome country without appearing but keeps at home in his own house, often some\ndisorderly persons, abusing his retirement, proclaim themselves; and each of\nthem, by assuming the character, imposes on the simple as king, and so men are\nled astray by the name, hearing that there is a king, but not seeing him, if\nfor no other reason, because they cannot enter the house; but when the real\nking comes forth and appears, then the disorderly impostors are exposed by his\npresence, while men, seeing the real king, desert those who previously led them\nastray: 5. in like manner, the evil spirits formerly used to deceive men,\ninvesting themselves with God’s honour; but when the Word of God appeared in a\nbody, and made known to us His own Father, then at length the deceit of the\nevil spirits is done away and stopped, while men, turning their eyes to the\ntrue God, Word of the Father, are deserting the idols, and now coming to know\nthe true God. 6. Now this is a proof that Christ is God the Word, and the Power\nof God. For whereas human things cease, and the Word of Christ abides, it is\nclear to all eyes that what ceases is temporary, but that He Who abides is God,\nand the true Son of God, His only-begotten Word.","index":"152","references":[]},{"text":"�56.

For thus the Lord Himself also says:\n“Henceforth157\nye shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming on\nthe clouds of heaven in the glory of the Father.” 5. And for this very reason\nthere is also a word of the Saviour to prepare us for that day, in these words:\n“Be158 ye ready and watch,\nfor He cometh at an hour ye know not.” For, according to the blessed Paul: “We159 must all stand before the\njudgment-seat of Christ. that each one may receive according as he hath done in\nthe body, whether it be good or bad.”","index":"155","references":[]},{"text":"�57.

For without\na pure mind and a modelling of the life after the saints, a man could not\npossibly comprehend the words of the saints. 3. For just as, if a man wished to\nsee the light of the sun, he would at any rate wipe and brighten his eye,\npurifying himself in some sort like what he desires, so that the eye, thus\nbecoming light, may see the light of the sun; or as, if a man would see a city\nor country, he at any rate comes to the place to see it;—thus he that would\ncomprehend the mind of those who speak of God must needs begin by washing and\ncleansing his soul, by his manner of living, and approach the saints themselves\nby imitating their works; so that, associated with them in the conduct of a\ncommon life, he may understand also what has been revealed to them by God, and\nthenceforth, as closely knit to them, may escape the peril of the sinners and\ntheir fire at the day of judgment, and receive what is laid up for the saints\nin the kingdom of heaven, which “Eye hath not seen160 , nor ear heard, neither have\nentered into the heart of man,” whatsoever things are prepared for them that\nlive a virtuous life, and love the God and Father, in Christ Jesus our Lord:\nthrough Whom and with Whom be to the Father Himself, with the Son Himself, in\nthe Holy Spirit, honour and might and glory for ever and ever.
