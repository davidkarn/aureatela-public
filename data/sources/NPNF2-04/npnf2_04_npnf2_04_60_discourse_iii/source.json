The Ario-maniacs, as it appears, having once made up their minds to transgress and revolt from the Truth, are strenuous in appropriating the words of Scripture, `When the impious cometh into a depth of evils, he despiseth[fn-64-P6496_2578629:1-nf] ;' for refutation does not stop them, nor perplexity abash them; but, as having `a whore's forehead,' they `refuse to be ashamed[fn-64-P6497_2578782:2-nf] ' before all men in their irreligion. For whereas the passages which they alleged, `The Lord created me[fn-64-P6498_2578902:3-nf] ,' and `Made better than the Angels[fn-64-P6499_2578956:4-nf] ,' and `First-born[fn-65-P6500_2578988:5-nf] ,' and `Faithful to Him that made Him[fn-65-P6501_2579038:6-nf] ' have a right sense[fn-65-P6502_2579071:7-nf] , and inculcate religiousness towards Christ, so it is that these men still, as if bedewed with the serpent's poison, not seeing what they ought to see, nor understanding what they read, as if in vomit from the depth of their irreligious heart, have next proceeded to disparage our Lord's words, `I in the Father and the Father in Me[fn-65-P6503_2579422:8-nf] ;' saying, `How can the One be contained in the Other and the Other in the One?' or `How at all can the Father who is the greater be contained in the Son who is the less?' or `What wonder, if the Son is in the Father,' considering it is written even of us, `In Him we live and move and have our being[fn-65-P6504_2579740:9-nf] ?' And this state of mind is consistent with their perverseness, who think God to be material, and understand not what is `True Father' and `True Son,' nor `Light Invisible' and `Eternal,' and Its `Radiance Invisible,' nor `Invisible Subsistence,' and `Immaterial Expression' and `Immaterial Image.' For did they know, they would not dishonour and ridicule the Lord of glory, nor interpreting things immaterial after a material manner, pervert good words. It were sufficient indeed, on hearing only words which are the Lord's, at once to believe, since the faith of simplicity is better than an elaborate process of persuasion; but since they have endeavoured to profane even this passage to their own heresy, it becomes necessary to expose their perverseness and to shew the mind of the truth, at least for the security of the faithful. For when it is said, `I in the Father and the Father in Me,' They are not therefore, as these suppose, discharged into Each Other, filling the One the Other, as in the case of empty vessels, so that the Son fills the emptiness of the Father and the Father that of the Son[fn-65-P6505_2582139:10-nf] , and Each of Them by Himself is not complete and perfect (for this is proper to bodies, and therefore the mere assertion of it is full of irreligion), for the Father is full and perfect, and the Son is the Fulness of Godhead. Nor again, as God, by coming into the Saints, strengthens them, thus is He also in the Son. For He is Himself the Father's Power and Wisdom, and by partaking of Him things originate are sanctified in the Spirit; but the Son Himself is not Son by participation, but is the Father's own Offspring[fn-65-P6506_2583663:11-nf] . Nor again is the Son in the Father, in the sense of the passage, `In Him we live and move and have our being;' for, He as being from the Fount[fn-65-P6507_2584256:12-nf] of the Father is the Life, in which all things are both quickened and consist; for the Life does not live in life[fn-65-P6508_2584394:13-nf] , else it would not be Life, but rather He gives life to all things.","index":"12","references":[{"fn":"64","code":"P6496_2578629","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Prov. xviii. 3, LXX.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","chapter":18,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"64","code":"P6497_2578782","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Jer. iii. 3.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"64","code":"P6498_2578902","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Supr. ch. xix.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"64","code":"P6499_2578956","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Ch. xiii.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"65","code":"P6500_2578988","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Ch. xxi.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"65","code":"P6501_2579038","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Ch. xiv.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"65","code":"P6502_2579071","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"ii. 44, n. 1.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"65","code":"P6503_2579422","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"John xiv. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":14,"verses":[10]}]},{"fn":"65","code":"P6504_2579740","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"of Rome","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"65","code":"P6505_2582139","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Cf.

But now let us see what Asterius the Sophist says, the retained pleader[fn-65-P6510_2585158:14-nf] for the heresy. In imitation then of the Jews so far, he writes as follows; `It is very plain that He has said, that He is in the Father and the Father again in Him, for this reason, that neither the word on which He was discoursing is, as He says, His own, but the Father's, nor the works belong to Him, but to the Father who gave Him the power.' Now this, if uttered at random by a little child, had been excused from his age; but when one who bears the title of Sophist, and professes universal knowledge[fn-65-P6511_2585693:15-nf] , is the writer, what a serious condemnation does he deserve! And does he not shew himself a stranger to the Apostle[fn-65-P6512_2586096:16-nf] , as being puffed up with persuasive words of wisdom, and thinking thereby to succeed in deceiving, not understanding himself what he says nor whereof he affirms[fn-65-P6513_2586277:17-nf] ? For what the Son has said as proper and suitable to a Son only, who is Word and Wisdom and Image of the Father's Essence, that he levels to all the creatures, and makes common to the Son and to them; and he says, lawless[fn-65-P6514_2586518:18-nf] man, that the Power of the Father receives power, that from this his irreligion it may follow to say that in a son[fn-65-P6515_2586729:19-nf] the Son was made a son, and the Word received a word's authority; and, far from granting that He spoke this as a Son, He ranks Him with all things made as having learned it as they have. For if the Son said, `I am in the Father and the Father in Me,' because His discourses were not His own words but the Father's, and so of His works, then,-since David says, `I will hear what the Lord God shall say in me[fn-65-P6516_2587204:20-nf] ,' and again Solomon[fn-65-P6517_2587249:21-nf] , `My words are spoken by God,' and since Moses was minister of words which were from God, and each of the Prophets spoke not what was his own but what was from God, `Thus saith the Lord,' and since the works of the Saints, as they professed, were not their own but God's who gave the power, Elijah for instance and Elisha invoking God that He Himself would raise the dead, and Elisha saying to Naaman, on cleansing him from the leprosy, `that thou mayest know that there is a God in Israel[fn-65-P6518_2587782:22-nf] ,' and Samuel too in the days of the harvest praying to God to grant rain, and the Apostles saying that not in their own power they did miracles but in the Lord's grace-it is plain that, according to Asterius such a statement must be common to all, so that each of them is able to say, `I in the Father and the Father in me;' and as a consequence that He is no longer one Son of God and Word and Wisdom, but, as others, is only one out of many.","index":"13","references":[{"fn":"65","code":"P6510_2585158","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"sunhgorou, infr. §60.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"65","code":"P6511_2585693","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"panta ginwskein epaggellomenoj.

But if the Lord said this, His words would not rightly have been, `I in the Father and the Father in Me,' but rather, `I too am in the Father, and the Father is in Me too,' that He may have nothing of His own and by prerogative[fn-65-P6520_2588491:23-nf] , relatively to the Father, as a Son, but the same grace in common with all. But it is not so, as they think; for not understanding that He is genuine Son from the Father, they belie Him who is such, whom alone it befits to say, `I in the Father and the Father in Me.' For the Son is in the Father, as it is allowed us to know, because the whole Being of the Son is proper to the Father's essence[fn-65-P6521_2588911:24-nf] , as radiance from light, and stream from fountain; so that whoso sees the Son, sees what is proper to the Father, and knows that the Son's Being, because from the Father, is therefore in the Father. For the Father is in the Son, since the Son is what is from the Father and proper to Him, as in the radiance the sun, and in the word the thought, and in the stream the fountain: for whoso thus contemplates the Son, contemplates what is proper to the Father's Essence, and knows that the Father is in the Son.

On this account and reasonably, having said before, `I and the Father are One,' He added, `I in the Father and the Father in Me,[fn-65-P6525_2591232:27-nf] ' by way of shewing the identity[fn-65-P6526_2591282:28-nf] of Godhead and the unity of Essence. For they are one, not[fn-65-P6527_2591364:29-nf] as one thing divided into two parts, and these nothing but one, nor as one thing twice named, so that the Same becomes at one time Father, at another His own Son, for this Sabellius holding was judged an heretic. But They are two, because the Father is Father and is not also Son, and the Son is Son and not also Father[fn-65-P6528_2591708:30-nf] ; but the nature is one; (for the offspring is not unlike[fn-65-P6529_2591781:31-nf] its parent, for it is his image), and all that is the Father's, is the Son's[fn-65-P6530_2591995:32-nf] . Wherefore neither is the Son another God, for He was not procured from without, else were there many, if a godhead be procured foreign from the Father's[fn-65-P6531_2592274:33-nf] ; for if the Son be other, as an Offspring, still He is the Same as God; and He and the Father are one in propriety and peculiarity of nature, and in the identity of the one Godhead, as has been said. For the radiance also is light, not second to the sun, nor a different light, nor from participation of it, but a whole and proper offspring of it. And such an offspring is necessarily one light; and no one would say that they are two lights[fn-65-P6532_2592732:34-nf] , but sun and radiance two, yet one the light from the sun enlightening in its radiance all things. So also the Godhead of the Son is the Father's; whence also it is indivisible; and thus there is one God and none other but He.

And why are the attributes of the Father ascribed to the Son, except that the Son is an Offspring from Him? and why are the Son's attributes proper to the Father, except again because the Son is the proper Offspring of His Essence? And the Son, being the proper Offspring of the Father's Essence, reasonably says that the Father's attributes are His own also; whence suitably and consistently with saying, `I and the Father are One,' He adds, `that ye may know that I am in the Father and the Father in Me[fn-65-P6542_2594517:43-nf] .' Moreover, He has added this again, `He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father[fn-65-P6543_2594642:44-nf] ;' and there is one and the same sense in these three[fn-65-P6544_2594713:45-nf] passages.

And we may perceive this at once from the illustration of the Emperor's image. For in the image is the shape and form of the Emperor, and in the Emperor is that shape which is in the image. For the likeness of the Emperor in the image is exact[fn-65-P6545_2596051:46-nf] ; so that a person who looks at the image, sees in it the Emperor; and he again who sees the Emperor, recognises that it is he who is in the image[fn-65-P6546_2596235:47-nf] . And from the likeness not differing, to one who after the image wished to view the Emperor, the image might say, `I and the Emperor are one; for I am in him, and he in me; and what thou seest in me, that thou beholdest in him, and what thou hast seen in him, that thou holdest in me[fn-65-P6547_2597080:48-nf] .'

And this is what is said, `Who being in the form of God[fn-65-P6549_2598563:49-nf] ,' and `the Father in Me.' Nor is this Form[fn-65-P6550_2598625:50-nf] of the Godhead partial merely, but the fulness of the Father's Godhead is the Being of the Son, and the Son is whole God. Therefore also, being equal to God, He `thought it not a prize to be equal to God;' and again since the Godhead and the Form of the Son is none other's than the Father's[fn-65-P6551_2598950:51-nf] , this is what He says, `I in the Father.' Thus `God was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself[fn-65-P6552_2599442:52-nf] ;' for the propriety of the Father's Essence is that Son, in whom the creation was then reconciled with God. Thus what things the Son then wrought are the Father's works, for the Son is the Form of that Godhead of the Father, which wrought the works. And thus he who looks at the Son, sees the Father; for in the Father's Godhead is and is contemplated the Son; and the Father's Form which is in Him shews in Him the Father; and thus the Father is in the Son. And that propriety and Godhead which is from the Father in the Son, shews the Son in the Father, and His inseparability from Him; and whoso hears and beholds that what is said of the Father is also said of the Son, not as accruing to His Essence by grace or participation, but because the very Being of the Son is the proper Offspring of the Father's Essence, will fitly understand the words, as I said before, `I in the Father, and the Father in Me;' and `I and the Father are One[fn-65-P6553_2600403:53-nf] .' For the Son is such as the Father is, because He has all that is the Father's. Wherefore also is He implied together with the Father. For, a son not being, one cannot say father; whereas when we call God a Maker, we do not of necessity intimate the things which have come to be; for a maker is before his works[fn-65-P6554_2600748:54-nf] . But when we call God Father, at once with the Father we signify the Son's existence. Therefore also he who believes in the Son, believes also in the Father: for he believes in what is proper to the Father's Essence; and thus the faith is one in one God. And he who worships and honours the Son, in the Son worships and honours the Father; for one is the Godhead; and therefore one[fn-65-P6555_2601405:55-nf] the honour and one the worship which is paid to the Father in and through the Son. And he who thus worships, worships one God; for there is one God and none other than He. Accordingly when the Father is called the only God, and we read that there is one God[fn-65-P6556_2601781:56-nf] , and `I am,' and `beside Me there is no God,' and `I the first and I the last[fn-65-P6557_2601879:57-nf] ,' this has a fit meaning. For God is One and Only and First; but this is not said to the denial of the Son[fn-65-P6558_2602041:58-nf] , perish the thought; for He is in that One, and First and Only, as being of that One and Only and First the Only Word and Wisdom and Radiance. And He too is the First, as the Fulness of the Godhead of the First and Only, being whole and full God[fn-65-P6559_2602312:59-nf] .

And this account of the meaning of such passages is satisfactory; for since those who are devoted to gods falsely so called, revolt from the True God, therefore God, being good and careful for mankind, recalling the wanderers, says, `I am Only God,' and `I Am,' and `Besides Me there is no God,' and the like; that He may condemn things which are not, and may convert all men to Himself. And as, supposing in the daytime when the sun was shining, a man were rudely to paint a piece of wood, which had not even the appearance of light, and call that image the cause of light, and if the sun with regard to it were to say, `I alone am the light of the clay, and there is no other light of the day but I,' he would say this, with regard, not to his own radiance, but to the error arising from the wooden image and the dissimilitude of that vain representation; so it is with `I am,' and `I am Only God,' and `There is none other besides Me,' viz. that He may make men renounce falsely called gods, and that they may recognise Him the true God instead. Indeed when God said this, He said it through His own Word, unless forsooth the modern[fn-65-P6573_2606476:68-nf] Jews add this too, that He has not said this through His Word; but so hath He spoken, though they rave, these followers of the devil[fn-65-P6574_2606667:69-nf] . For the Word of the Lord came to the Prophet, and this was what was heard; nor is there a thing which God says or does, but He says and does it in the Word. Not then with reference to Him is this said, O Christ's enemies, but to things foreign to Him and not from[fn-65-P6575_2607632:70-nf] Him. For according to the aforesaid illustration, if the sun had spoken those words, he would have been setting right the error and have so spoken, not as having his radiance without him, but in the radiance shewing his own light. Therefore not for the denial of the Son, nor with reference to Him, are such passages, but to the overthrow of falsehood. Accordingly God spoke not such words to Adam at the beginning, though His Word was with Him, by whom all things came to be; for there was no need, before idols came in; but when men made insurrection against the truth and named for themselves gods such as they would[fn-65-P6576_2608294:71-nf] , then it was that need arose of such words, for the denial of gods that were not. Nay I would add, that they were said even in anticipation of the folly of these Christ-opposers[fn-65-P6577_2608507:72-nf] , that they might know, that whatsoever god they devise external to the Father's Essence, he is not True God, nor Image and Son of the Only and First.","index":"21","references":[{"fn":"65","code":"P6573_2606476","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"oi nun, cf.

And hence the Lord Himself added at once, `And Jesus Christ whom Thou didst send[fn-65-P6580_2609100:74-nf] .' Now had He been a creature, He would not have added this, and ranked Himself with His Creator (for what fellowship is there between the True and the not true?); but as it is, by adding Himself to the Father, He has shewn that He is of the Father's nature; and He has given us to know that of the True Father He is True Offspring. And John too, as he had learned[fn-65-P6581_2609483:75-nf] , so he teaches this, writing in his Epistle, `And we are in the True, even in His Son Jesus Christ; This is the True God and eternal life[fn-65-P6582_2609681:76-nf] .' And when the Prophet says concerning the creation, `That stretcheth forth the heavens alone[fn-65-P6583_2609795:77-nf] ,' and when God says, `I only stretch out the heavens,' it is made plain to every one, that in the Only is signified also the Word of the Only, in whom `all things were made,' and without whom `was made not one thing.' Therefore, if they were made through the Word, and yet He says, `I Only,' and together with that Only is understood the Son, through whom the heavens were made, so also then, if it be said, `One God,' and `I Only,' and `I the First,' in that One and Only and First is understood the Word coexisting, as in the Light the Radiance. And this can be understood of no other than the Word alone. For all other things subsisted out of nothing through the Son, and are greatly different in nature; but the Son Himself is natural and true Offspring from the Father; and thus the very passage which these insensates have thought fit to adduce, `I the First,' in defence of their heresy, doth rather expose their perverse spirit. For God says, `I the First and I the Last;' if then, as though ranked with the things after Him, He is said to be first of them, so that they come next to Him, then certainly you will have shewn that He Himself precedes the works in time only[fn-65-P6584_2610997:78-nf] ; which, to go no further, is extreme irreligion; but if it is in order to prove that He is not from any, nor any before Him, but that lie is Origin and Cause of all things, and to destroy the Gentile fables, that He has said `I the First,' it is plain also, that when the Son is called First-born, this is done not for the sake of ranking Him with the creation, but to prove the framing and adoption of all things[fn-65-P6585_2611740:79-nf] through the Son. For as the Father is First, so also is He both First[fn-65-P6586_2611829:80-nf] , as Image of the First, and because the First is in Him, and also Offspring from the Father, in whom the whole creation is created and adopted into sonship.","index":"22","references":[{"fn":"65","code":"P6579_2608907","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"John xiv. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":14,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"65","code":"P6580_2609100","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Ib. xvii. 3.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"65","code":"P6581_2609483","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"maqwn edidace, de Decr. 7, n. 8; Or. ii. 1, note 6 a.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"65","code":"P6582_2609681","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"1 John v. 20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 john","chapter":5,"verses":[20]}]},{"fn":"65","code":"P6583_2609795","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Isai. xliv. 24.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"65","code":"P6584_2610997","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"He says that in `I the first' the question of time does not come in, else creatures would come `second' to the Creator, as if His and their duration admitted of a common measure. `First' then does not imply succession, but is equivalent to arxh; a word which, as `Father,' does not imply that the Son is not from eternity.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"65","code":"P6585_2611740","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"ii. 62, n. 2.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"65","code":"P6586_2611829","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"It is no inconsistency to say that the Father is first, and the Son first also, for comparison or number does not enter into mystery.

Now what can be more unseemly or irrational than this? for if therefore the Son and the Father are One and if in this way the Word is like the Father it follows forthwith[fn-65-P6594_2616148:84-nf] that the Angels[fn-65-P6595_2616313:85-nf] too, and the other beings above us, Powers and Authorities, and Thrones and Dominions, and what we see, Sun and Moon, and the Stars, should be sons also, as the Son; and that it should be said of them too, that they and the Father are one, and that each is God's Image and Word. For what God wills, that will they; and neither in judging nor in doctrine are they discordant, but in all things are obedient to their Maker. For they would not have remained in their own glory, unless, what the Father willed, that they had willed also. He, for instance, who did not remain, but went astray, heard the words, `How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning[fn-65-P6596_2617059:86-nf] ?' But if this be so, how is only He Only-begotten Son and Word and Wisdom? or how, whereas so many are like the Father. is He only an Image? for among men too will be found many like the Father, numbers, for instance, of martyrs, and before them the Apostles and Prophets, and again before them the Patriarchs. And many now too keep the Saviour's command, being merciful `as their Father which is in heaven[fn-65-P6597_2617485:87-nf] ,' and observing the exhortation, `Be ye therefore followers of God as dear children, and walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us[fn-65-P6598_2617656:88-nf] ;' many too have become followers of Paul as he also of Christ[fn-65-P6599_2617746:89-nf] . And yet no one of these is Word or Wisdom or Only-begotten Son or Image; nor did any one of them make bold to say, `I and the Father are One,' or, `I in the Father, and the Father in Me[fn-66-P6600_2617953:90-nf] ;' but it is said of all of them, `Who is like unto Thee among the gods, O Lord? and who shall be likened to the Lord among the sons of Gods[fn-66-P6601_2618125:91-nf] ?' and of Him on the contrary that He only is Image true and natural of the Father. For though we have been made after the Image[fn-66-P6602_2618292:92-nf] , and called both image and glory of God, yet not on our own account still, but for that Image and true Glory of God inhabiting us, which is His Word, who was for us afterwards made flesh, have we this grace of our designation.","index":"25","references":[{"fn":"65","code":"P6591_2614576","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"wj autoi felousi. vid. §8, n. 12. `not as you say, but as we will.'

This their notion then being evidently unseemly and irrational as well as the rest, the likeness and the oneness must be referred to the very Essence of the Son; for unless it be so taken, He will not be shown to have anything beyond things originate, as has been said, nor will He be like the Father, but He will be like the Father's doctrines; and He differs from the Father, in that the Father is Father[fn-66-P6604_2618959:93-nf] , but the doctrines and teaching are the Father's. If then in respect to the doctrines and the teaching the Son is like the Father, then the Father according to them will be Father in name only, and the Son will not be an exact Image, or rather will be seen to have no propriety at all or likeness of the Father; for what likeness or propriety has he who is so utterly different from the Father? for Paul taught like the Saviour, yet was not like `Him in essence[fn-66-P6605_2620345:94-nf] .' Having then such notions, they speak falsely; whereas the Son and the Father are one in such wise as has been said, and in such wise is the Son like the Father Himself and from Him, as we may see and understand son to be towards father, and as we may see the radiance towards the sun. Such then being the Son, therefore when the Son works, the Father is the Worker[fn-66-P6606_2620755:95-nf] , and the Son coming to the Saints, the Father is He who cometh in the Son[fn-66-P6607_2620845:96-nf] , as He promised when He said, `I and My Father will come, and will make Our abode with hire[fn-66-P6608_2622002:97-nf] ;' for in the Image is contemplated the Father, and in the Radiance is the Light. Therefore also, as we said just now, when the Father gives grace and peace, the Son also gives it, as Paul signifies in every Epistle, writing, `Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.' For one and the same grace is from the Father in the Son, as the light of the sun and of the radiance is one, and as the sun's illumination is effected through the radiance; and so too when he prays for the Thessalonians, in saying, `Now God Himself even our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, may He direct our way unto you[fn-66-P6609_2622644:98-nf] ,' he has guarded the unity of the Father and of the Son.

For if there were no unity, nor the Word the own Offspring of the Father's Essence, as the radiance of the light, but the Son were divided in nature from the Father, it were sufficient that the Father alone should give, since none of originate things is a partner with his Maker in His givings; but, as it is, such a mode of giving shews the oneness of the Father and the Son. No one, for instance, would pray to receive from God and the Angels[fn-66-P6611_2623421:99-nf] , or from any other creature, nor would any one say,`May God and the Angel give thee;' but from Father and the Son, because of Their oneness and the oneness of Their giving. For through the Son is given what is given; and there is nothing but the Father operates it through the Son; for thus is grace secure to him who receives it. And if the Patriarch Jacob, blessing his grandchildren Ephraim and Manasses, said, `God which fed me all my life long unto this day, the Angel which delivered me from all evil, bless the lads[fn-66-P6612_2624677:100-nf] ,' yet none of created and natural Angels did he join to God their Creator, nor rejecting God that fed him, did he from Angel ask the blessing on his grandsons; but in saying, `Who delivered me from all evil,' he shewed that it was no created Angel, but the Word of God, whom he joined to the Father in his prayer, through whom, whomsoever He will, God doth deliver. For knowing that He is also called the Father's `Angel of great Counsel[fn-66-P6613_2625677:101-nf] ,' he said that none other than He was the Giver of blessing, and Deliverer from evil Nor was it that he desired a blessing for himself from God but for his grandchildren from the Angel, but whom He Himself had besought saying, `I will not let Thee go except Thou bless me[fn-66-P6614_2625973:102-nf] ' (for that was God, as he says himself, `I have seen God face to face'), Him he prayed to bless also the sons of Joseph. It is proper then to an Angel to minister at the command of God, and often does he go forth to cast out the Amorite, and is sent to guard the people in the way; but these are not his doings, but of God who commanded and sent him, whose also it is to deliver, whom He will deliver. There- fore it was no other than the Lord God Himself whom he had seen, who said to him, `And behold I am with thee, to guard thee in all the way whither thou[fn-66-P6615_2626575:103-nf] goest;' and it was no other than God whom lie had seen, who kept Laban from his treachery, ordering him not to speak evil words to Jacob; and none other than God did he himself beseech, saying, `Rescue me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I fear him[fn-66-P6616_2626858:104-nf] ;' for in conversation too with his wives he said, `God hath not suffered Laban to injure me.'","index":"27","references":[{"fn":"66","code":"P6611_2623421","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Vid.

But if it belong to none other than God to bless and to deliver, and none other was the deliverer of Jacob than the Lord Himself and Him that delivered him the Patriarch besought for his grandsons, evidently none other did he join to God in his prayer, than God's Word, whom therefore he called Angel, because it is He alone who reveals the Father.

For thus the blessing was secure, because of the Son's indivisibility from the Father, and for that the grace given by Them is one and the same. For though the Father gives it, through the Son is the gift; and though the Son be said to vouchsafe it, it is the Father who supplies it through and in the Son; for `I thank my God,' says the Apostle writing to the Corinthians, `always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given yon in Christ Jesus[fn-66-P6623_2629025:110-nf] .'

Nor, on seeing an Angel would a man say that he had seen the Father; for Angels, as it is written, are `ministering spirits sent forth to minister[fn-66-P6626_2629971:112-nf] ,' and are heralds of gifts given by Him through the Word to those who receive them. And the Angel on his appearance, himself confesses that he has been sent by his Lord; as Gabriel confessed in the case of Zacharias, and also in the case of Mary, bearer of God[fn-66-P6627_2630252:113-nf] . And he who beholds a vision of Angels, knows that he has seen the Angel and not God. For Zacharias saw an Angel; and Isaiah saw the Lord. Manoah, the father of Samson, saw an Angel; but Moses beheld God. Gideon saw an Angel, but to Abraham appeared God. And neither he who saw God, beheld an Angel, nor he who saw an Angel, considered that he saw God; for greatly, or rather wholly, do things by nature originate differ from God the Creator. But if at any time, when the Angel was seen, he who saw it heard God's voice, as took place at the bush; for `the Angel of the Lord was seen in a flame of fire out of the bush, and the Lord called Moses out of the bush, saying, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob[fn-66-P6628_2632388:114-nf] ,' yet was not the Angel the God of Abraham, but in the Angel God spoke.

So again to the son of Nun He spake by an Angel. But what God speaks, it is very plain He speaks through the Word, and not through another. And the Word, as being not separate from the Father, nor unlike and foreign to the Father's Essence, what He works, those are the Father's works, and His framing of all things is one with His; and what the Son gives, that is the Father's gift. And he who hath seen the Son, knows that, in seeing Him, he has seen, not Angel, nor one merely greater than Angels, nor in short any creature, but the Father Himself.

For either they will say that the Word is not God; or saying that He is God[fn-66-P6633_2634482:118-nf] , because it is so written, but not proper to the Father's Essence, they will introduce many because of their difference of kind (unless forsooth they shall dare to say that by participation only, He, as all things else, is called God; though, if this be their sentiment, their irreligion is the same, since they consider the Word as one among all things). But let this never even come into our mind. For there is but one form[fn-66-P6634_2634934:119-nf] of Godhead, which is also in the Word; and one God, the Father,existing by Himself according as He is above all, and appearing in the Son according as He pervades all things, and in the Spirit according as in Him He acts in all things through the Word[fn-66-P6635_2635200:120-nf] . For thus we confess God to be one through the Triad, and we say that it is much more religious than the godhead of the heretics with its many kinds[fn-66-P6636_2635643:121-nf] , and many parts, to entertain a belief of the One Godhead in a Triad.","index":"30","references":[{"fn":"66","code":"P6631_2633662","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Serap. i. 28 fin.

For if it be not so, but the Word is a creature and a work out of nothing, either He is not True God because He is Himself one of the creatures, or if they name Him God from regard for the Scriptures, they must of necessity say that there are two Gods[fn-66-P6638_2635988:122-nf] , one Creator, the other creature, and must serve two Lords, one Unoriginate, and the other originate and a creature; and must have two faiths, one in the True God, and the other in one who is made and fashioned by themselves and called God. And it follows of necessity in so great blindness, that, when they worship the Unoriginate, they renounce the originate, and when they come to the creature, they turn from the Creator. For they cannot see the One in the Other, because their natures and operations are foreign and distinct[fn-66-P6639_2636972:123-nf] . And with such sentiments, they will certainly be going on to more gods, for this will be the essay[fn-66-P6640_2637091:124-nf] of those who revolt from the One God. Wherefore then, when the Arians have these speculations and views, do they not rank themselves with the Gentiles? for they too, as these, worship the creature rather than God the Creator of all[fn-66-P6641_2637360:125-nf] , and though they shrink from the Gentile name, in order to deceive the unskilful, yet they secretly hold a like sentiment with them. For their subtle saying which they are accustomed to urge, We say not two `Unoriginates[fn-66-P6642_2637896:126-nf] ,' they plainly say to deceive the simple; for in their very professing `We say not two Unoriginates,' they imply two Gods, and these with different natures, one originate and one Unoriginate. And though the Greeks worship one Unoriginate and many originate, but these one Unoriginate and one originate, this is no differ- ence from them; for the God whom they call originate is one out of many, and again the many gods of the Greeks have the same nature with this one, for both he and they are creatures. Unhappy are they, and the more for that their hurt is from thinking against Christ; for they have fallen from the truth, and are greater traitors than the Jews in denying the Christ, and they wallow[fn-66-P6643_2638626:127-nf] with the Gentiles, hateful[fn-66-P6644_2638751:128-nf] as they are to God, worshipping the creature and many deities. For there is One God, and not many, and One is His Word, and not many; for the Word is God, and He alone has the Form[fn-66-P6645_2638975:129-nf] of the Father. Being then such, the Saviour Himself troubled the Jews with these words, `The Father Himself which hath sent Me, hath borne witness of Me; ye have neither heard His voice at any time nor seen His Form; and ye have not His Word abiding in you; for whom He hath sent, Him ye believe not[fn-66-P6646_2641125:130-nf] .' Suitably has He joined the `Word' to the `Form,' to shew that the Word of God is Himself Image and Expression and Form of His Father; and that the Jews who did not receive Him who spoke to them, thereby did not receive the Word, which is the Form of God. This too it was that the Patriarch Jacob having seen, received a blessing from Him and the name of Israel instead of Jacob, as divine Scripture witnesses, saying, `And as he passed by the Form of God, the Sun rose upon him[fn-66-P6647_2641625:131-nf] .' And This it was who said, `He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father,' and,`I in the Father and the Father in Me,' and, `I and the Father are one[fn-66-P6648_2641802:132-nf] ;' for thus God is One, and one the faith in the Father and Son; for, though the Word be God, the Lord our God is one Lord; for the Son is proper to that One, and inseparable according to the propriety and peculiarity of His Essence.","index":"31","references":[{"fn":"66","code":"P6638_2635988","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Vid. p. 75, note 7; de Syn. 27 (2), and 50, note 5.

For this is written in the Gospel according to John, and Christ desired it for us in these words, `Holy Father, keep through Thine own Name, those whom Thou hast given Me, that they may be one, as We are[fn-66-P6651_2642620:134-nf] .' And shortly after; `Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on Me through their Word; that they all may be one, as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be one in Us, that the world may believe that Thou hast sent Me.

If then, as we have many times said, the Word of God is the same with us, and nothing differs from us except in time, let Him be like us, and have the same place with the Father as we have; nor let Him be called Only-begotten, nor Only Word or Wisdom of the Father; but let the same name be of common application to all us who are like Him. For it is right, that they who have one nature, should have their name in common, though they differ from each other in point of time. For Adam was a man, and Paul a man, and he who is now born is a man, and time is not that which alters the nature of the race[fn-66-P6660_2645123:142-nf] .

But in truth neither we are Word or Wisdom, nor is He creature or work; else why are we all sprung from one, and He the Only Word? but though it be suitable in them thus to speak, in us at least it is unsuitable to entertain their blasphemies.

For instance, in the case of the bad, as when it charges, `Be ye not like to horse and mule which have no understanding[fn-66-P6664_2646277:146-nf] .' Or as when it says, complaining of those who have become such, `Man, being in honour, hath no understanding, but is compared unto the beasts that perish.' And again, `They were as wanton horses[fn-66-P6665_2646509:147-nf] .'

And He said this, not that we may become in nature beasts of burden, or become serpents and doves; for He hath not so made us Himself, and therefore nature does not allow of it; but that we might eschew the irrational motions of the one, and being aware of the wisdom of that other animal, might not be deceived by it, and might take on us the meekness of the dove.","index":"33","references":[{"fn":"66","code":"P6660_2645123","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"De Decr. 10; Or. i. 26, n. 1.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"66","code":"P6661_2645499","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Cf.

And He said this too, not that we might become such as the Father; for to become as the Father, is impossible for us creatures, who have been brought to be out of nothing; but as He charged us, `Be ye not like to horse,' not lest we should become as draught animals, but that we should not imitate their want of reason, so, not that we might become as God, did He say, `Be ye merciful as your Father,' but that looking at His beneficent acts, what we do well, we might do, not for men's sake, but for His sake, so that from Him and not from men we may have the reward. For as, although there be one Son by nature, True and Only-begotten, we too become sons, not as He in nature and truth, but according to the grace of Him that calleth, and though we are men from the earth, are yet called gods[fn-66-P6671_2648191:152-nf] , not as the True God or His Word, but as has pleased God who has given us that grace; so also, as God do we become merciful, not by being made equal to God, nor becoming in nature and truth benefactors (for it is not our gift to benefit but belongs to God), but in order that what has accrued to us from God Himself by grace, these things we may impart to others, without making distinctions, but largely towards all extending our kind service. For only in this way can we anyhow become imitators, and in no other, when we minister to others what comes from Him. And as we put a fair and right[fn-66-P6672_2648831:153-nf] sense upon these texts, such again is the sense of the lection in John.

And for this reason also the words, `that they may be one in Us,' have a right sense. If, for instance, it were possible for us to become as the Son in the Father, the words ought to run, `that they may be one in Thee,' as the Son is in the Father; but, as it is, He has not said this; but by saying `in Us' He has pointed out the distance and difference; that He indeed is alone in the Father alone, as Only Word and Wisdom; but we in the Son, and through Him in the Father. And thus speaking, He meant this only, `By Our unity may they also be so one with each other, as We are one in nature and truth; for otherwise they could not be one, except by learning unity in Us.' And that `in Us' has this signification, we may learn from Paul, who says, `These things I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos, that ye may learn in us not to be puffed up above that is written[fn-66-P6684_2653408:163-nf] .' The words `in Us' then, are not `in the Father,' as the Son is in Him; but imply an example and image, instead of saying, `Let them learn of Us.' For as Paul to the Corinthians, so is the oneness of the Son and the Father a pattern and lesson to all, by which they may learn, looking to that natural unity of the Father and the Son, how they themselves ought to be one in spirit towards each other. Or if it needs to account for the phrase otherwise, the words `in Us' may mean the same as saying, that in the power of the Father and the Son they may be one, speaking the same things[fn-66-P6685_2654016:164-nf] ; for without God this is impossible. And this mode of speech also we may find in the divine writings, as `In God will we do great acts;' and `In God I shall leap over the wall[fn-66-P6686_2654219:165-nf] ;' and `In Thee will we tread down our enemies[fn-66-P6687_2654300:166-nf] .' Therefore it is plain, that in the Name of Father and Son we shall be able, becoming one, to hold firm the bond of charity. For, dwelling still on the same thought, the Lord says, `And the glory which Thou gavest Me, I have given to them, that they may be one as We are one.' Suitably has He here too said, not, `that they may be in Thee as I am,' but `as We are;' now he who says `as'[fn-66-P6688_2654774:167-nf] , signifies not identity, but an image and example of the matter in hand.","index":"36","references":[{"fn":"66","code":"P6684_2653408","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"1 Cor. iv. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":4,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"66","code":"P6685_2654016","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Vid. 1 Cor. i. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":1,"verses":[10]}]},{"fn":"66","code":"P6686_2654219","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Ps. lx. 12; Ps. xviii. 29.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":60,"verses":[12]},{"book":"psalms","chapter":18,"verses":[29]},{"book":"psalms","chapter":60,"verses":[12]},{"book":"psalms","chapter":18,"verses":[29]}]},{"fn":"66","code":"P6687_2654300","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Winer. xlviii. a.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"66","code":"P6688_2654774","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"This remark which comes in abruptly is pursued presently, vid. §23.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"22. The Word then has the real and true identity of nature with the Father; but to us it is given to imitate it, as has been said; for He immediately adds, `I in them and Thou in Me; that they may be made perfect in one.' Here at length the Lord asks something greater and more perfect for us; for it is plain that the Word has come to be in us[fn-66-P6690_2655267:168-nf] , for He has put on our body. `And Thou Father in Me;' `for I am Thy Word, and since Thou art in Me, because I am Thy Word, and I in them because of the body, and because of Thee the salvation of men is perfected in Me, therefore I ask that they also may become one, according to the body that is in Me and according to its perfection; that they too may become perfect, having oneness with It, and having become one in It; that, as if all were carried by Me, all may be one body and one spirit, and may grow up unto a perfect man[fn-66-P6691_2655827:169-nf] .'

For Jonah was not as the Saviour, nor did Jonah go down to hades; nor was the whale hades; nor did Jonah, when swallowed up, bring up those who had before been swallowed by the whale, but he alone came forth, when the whale was bidden. Therefore there is no identity nor equality signified in the term `as,' but one thing and another; and it shews a certain kind[fn-66-P6697_2658022:174-nf] of parallel in the case of Jonah, on account of the three days. In like manner then we too, when the Lord says `as,' neither become as the Son in the Father, nor as the Father is in the Son. For we become one as the Father and the Son in mind and agreement[fn-66-P6698_2658441:175-nf] of spirit, and the Saviour will be as Jonah in the earth; but as the Saviour is not Jonah, nor, as he was swallowed up, so did the Saviour descend into hades, but it is but a parallel, in like manner, if we too become one, as the Son in the Father, we shall not be as the Son, nor equal to Him; for He and we are but parallel.

We then, by way of giving a rude view of the expressions in this passage, have been led into many words, but blessed John will shew from his Epistle the sense of the words, concisely and much more perfectly than we can. And he will both disprove the interpretation of these irreligious men, and will teach how we become in God and God in us; and bow again we become One in Him, and how far the Son differs in nature from us, and will stop the Arians from any longer thinking that they shall be as the Son, lest they hear it said to them, `Thou art a man and not God,' and `Stretch not thyself, being poor, beside a rich man[fn-67-P6705_2660877:181-nf] .'

Therefore because of the grace of the Spirit which has been given to us, in Him we come to be, and He in us[fn-67-P6707_2661169:183-nf] ; and since it is the Spirit of God, therefore through His becoming in us, reasonably are we, as having the Spirit, considered to be in God, and thus is God in us. Not then as the Son in the Father, so also we become in the Father; for the Son does not merely partake the Spirit, that therefore He too may be in the Father; nor does He receive the Spirit, but rather He supplies It Himself to all; and the Spirit does not unite the Word to the Father[fn-67-P6708_2661642:184-nf] , but rather the Spirit receives from the Word. And the Son is in the Father, as His own Word and Radiance; but we, apart from the Spirit, are strange and distant from God, and by the participation of the Spirit we are knit into the Godhead; so that our being in the Father is not ours, but is the Spirit's which is in us and abides in us, while by the true confession we preserve it in us, John again saying, `Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him and he in Gods[fn-67-P6709_2662311:185-nf] .'

For since the Word is in the Father, and the Spirit is given from[fn-67-P6713_2663582:188-nf] the Word, He wills that we should receive the Spirit, that, when we receive It, thus having the Spirit of the Word which is in the Father, we too may be found on account of the Spirit to become One in the Word, and through Him in the Father.

This then is what the irreligious men allege in their discourses; and if they thus argue, they might consistently speak yet more daringly; `Why did the Word become flesh at all?' and they might add; `For how could He, being God, become man?' or, `How could the Immaterial bear a body?' or they might speak with Caiaphas still more Judaically, `Wherefore at all did Christ, being a man, make Himself God[fn-67-P6736_2670465:206-nf] ' for this and the like the Jews then muttered when they saw, and now the Ariomaniacs disbelieve when they read, and have fallen away into blasphemies.

Next, while the Jews sought to kill the Lord, because He said that God was His own Father and madeHimself equal to Him, as working what the Father works, the Arians also, not only have learned to deny, both that He is equal to God and that God is the own and natural Father of the Word, but those who hold this they seek to kill.

Whence it was that, when the flesh suffered, the Word was not external to it; and therefore is the passion said to be His: and when He did divinely His Father's works, the flesh was not external to Him, but in the body itself did the Lord do them. Hence, when made man, He said[fn-67-P6779_2688185:244-nf] , `If I do not the works of the Father, believe Me not; but if I do, though ye believe not Me, believe the works, that ye may know that the Father is in He and I in Him.' And thus when there was need to raise Peter's wife's mother, who was sick of a fever, He stretched forth His hand humanly, but He stopped the illness divinely. And in the case of the man blind from the birth, human was the spittle which He gave forth from the flesh, but divinely did He open the eyes through the clay. And in the case of Lazarus, He gave forth a human voice as man; but divinely, as God, did He raise Lazarus from the dead[fn-67-P6780_2689107:245-nf] .

If then the body had been another's, to him too had been the affections attributed; but if the flesh is theWord's (for `the Word became flesh'), of necessity then the affections also of the flesh are ascribed to Him, whose the flesh is. And to whom the affections are ascribed, such namely as to be condemned, to be scourged, to thirst, and the cross, and death, and the other infirmities of the body, of Him too is the triumph and the grace. For this cause then, consistently and fittingly such affections are ascribed not to another[fn-67-P6782_2690633:247-nf] , but to the Lord; that the grace also may be from Him[fn-67-P6783_2690893:248-nf] , and that we may become, not worshippers of any other, but truly devout towards God, because we invoke no originate thing, no ordinary[fn-67-P6784_2691075:249-nf] man, but the natural and true Son from God, who has become man, yet is not the less Lord and God and Saviour.","index":"49","references":[{"fn":"67","code":"P6779_2688185","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"John x. 37, John x. 38. vid.

Who will not admire this? or who will not agree that such a thing is truly divine? for if the works of the Word's Godhead had not taken place through the body, man had not been deified; and again, had not the properties of the flesh been ascribed to the Word, man had not been thoroughly delivered from them[fn-67-P6786_2691598:250-nf] ; but though they had ceased for a little while, as I said before, still sin had remained in him and corruption, as was the case with mankind before Him; and for this reason:-Many for instance have been made holy and dean from all sin; nay, Jeremiah was hallowed[fn-67-P6787_2691920:251-nf] even from the womb, and John, while yet in the womb, leapt for joy at the voice of Mary Bearer of God[fn-67-P6788_2692455:252-nf] ; nevertheless `death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression[fn-67-P6789_2693078:253-nf] ;' and thus man remained mortal and corruptible as before, liable to the affections proper to their nature. But now the Word having become man and having appropriated[fn-67-P6790_2693264:254-nf] what pertains to the flesh, no longer do these things touch the body, because of the Word who has come in it, but they are destroyed[fn-67-P6791_2693799:255-nf] by Him, and henceforth men no longerremain sinners and dead according to their proper affections, but having risen according to the Word's power, they abide[fn-67-P6792_2694414:256-nf] ever immortal and incorruptible. Whence also, whereas the flesh is born of Mary Bearer of God[fn-67-P6793_2694533:257-nf] , He Himself is said to have been born, who furnishes to others an origin of being; in order that He may transfer our origin into Himself, and we may no longer, as mere earth, return to earth, but as being knit into the Word from heaven, may be carded to heaven by Him. Therefore in like manner not without reason has He transferred to Himself the other affections of the body also; that we, no longer as being men, but as proper to the Word, may have share in eternal life. For no longer according to our former origin in Adam do we die; but henceforward our origin and all infirmity of flesh being transferred to the Word, we rise from the earth, the curse from sin being removed, because of Him who is in us[fn-67-P6794_2695749:258-nf] , and who has become a curse for us.

For lest a man, perceiving that the Son has all that the Father hath, from the exact likeness and identity of that He hath, should wander into the irreligion of Sabellius, considering Him to be the Father, therefore He has said `Was given unto Me,' and `I received,' and `Were delivered to Me[fn-68-P6820_2703665:276-nf] ,' only to shew that He is not the Father, but the Father's Word, and the Eternal Son, who because of His likeness to the Father, has eternally what He has from Him, and because He is the Son, has from the Father what He has eternally. Moreover that `Was given' and `Were delivered,' and the like, do not impair[fn-68-P6821_2704013:277-nf] the Godhead of the Son, but rather shew Him to be truly[fn-68-P6822_2704100:278-nf] Son, we may learn from the passages themselves. For if all things are delivered unto Him, first, He is other than that all which He has received; next, being Heir of all things, He alone is the Son and proper according to the Essence of the Father. For if He were one of all, then He were not `heir of all[fn-68-P6823_2704431:279-nf] ,' but every one had received according as the Father willed and gave. But now, as receiving all things, He is other than them all, and alone proper to the Father. Moreover that `Was given' and `Were delivered' do not shew that once He had them not, we may conclude from a similar passage, and in like manner concerning them all; for the Saviour Himself says, `As the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given also to the Son to have life in Himself[fn-68-P6824_2704903:280-nf] .' Now from the words `Hath given,' He signifies that He is not the Father; but in saying `so,' He shews the Son's natural likeness and propriety towards the Father. If then once the Father had not, plainly the Son once had not; for as the Father, `so' also the Son has. But if this is irreligious to say, and religious on the contrary to say that the Father had ever, is it not unseemly in themwhen the Son says that, `as' the Father has, `so' also the Son has, to say that He has not `so[fn-68-P6825_2705413:281-nf] ,' but otherwise? Rather then is the Word faithful, and all things which He says that He has received, He has always, yet has from the Father; and the Father indeed not from any, but the Son from the Father. For as in the instance of the radiance, if the radiance itself should say, `All places the light hath given me to enlighten, and I do not enlighten from myself, but as the light wills,' yet, in saying this, it does not imply that it once had not, but it means, `I am proper to the light, and all things of the light are mine;' so, and much more, must we understand in the instance of the Son. For the Father, having given all things to the Son, in the Son still[fn-68-P6826_2706108:282-nf] hath all things; and the Son having, still the Father hath them; for the Son's Godhead is the Father's Godhead, and thus the Father in the Son exercises His Providence[fn-68-P6827_2708323:283-nf] over all things.","index":"57","references":[{"fn":"68","code":"P6820_2703665","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"John x. 18; Mat. xxviii. 18.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":10,"verses":[18]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":28,"verses":[18]},{"book":"john","chapter":10,"verses":[18]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":28,"verses":[18]}]},{"fn":"68","code":"P6821_2704013","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Or. i. 45; ad Adelph. 4","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"68","code":"P6822_2704100","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Or. ii. 19, n. 3.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"68","code":"P6823_2704431","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Heb. i. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"hebrews","chapter":1,"verses":[2]}]},{"fn":"68","code":"P6824_2704903","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"John v. 26.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":5,"verses":[26]}]},{"fn":"68","code":"P6825_2705413","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Or. ii. 55, n. 8.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"68","code":"P6826_2706108","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"palin. vid.

Nothing can be named which the Son is in Himself, as distinct from the Father; we are but told His relation towards the Father, and thus the sole meaning we are able to attach to Person is a relation of the Son towards the Father; and distinct from and beyond that relation, He is but the One God, who is also the Father. This sacred subject has been touched upon supr. Or. iii. 9, n. 8. In other words, there is an indestructible essential relation existing in the One Indivisible infinitely simple God, such as to constitute Him, viewed on each side of that relation (what in human language we call) Two (and in like manner Three), yet without the notion of number really coming in. When we speak of `Person,' we mean nothing more than the One God in substance, viewed relatively to Him the One God, as viewed in that Correlative which we therefore call another Person. These various statements are not here intended to explain, but to bring home to the mind what it is which faith receives.

And while such is the sense of expressions like these, those which speak humanly concerning the Saviour admit of a religious meaning also. For with this end have we examined them beforehand, that, if we should hear Him asking where Lazarus is laid[fn-68-P6829_2708621:284-nf] , or when He asks on coming into the parts of Caesarea, `Whom do men say that I am?' or, `How many loaves have ye?' and, `What will ye that I shall do unto you[fn-68-P6830_2708816:285-nf] ?' we may know, from what has been already said, the right[fn-68-P6831_2708924:286-nf] sense of the passages, and may not stumble as Christ's enemies the Arians. First then we must put this question to the irreligious, why they consider Him ignorant? for one who asks, does not for certain ask from ignorance; but it is possible for one who knows, still to ask concerning what He knows. Thus John was aware that Christ, when asking, `How many loaves have ye?' was not ignorant, for he says, `And this He said to prove him, for He Himself knew what He would do[fn-68-P6832_2709418:287-nf] .' But if He knew what He was doing, therefore not in ignorance, but with knowledge did He ask. From this instance we may understand similar ones; that, when the Lord asks, He does not ask in ignorance, where Lazarus lies, nor again, whom men do say that He is; but knowing the thing which He was asking, aware what He was about to do. And thus with ease is their clever point exploded; but if they still persist[fn-68-P6833_2709850:288-nf] on account of His asking, then they must be told that in the Godhead indeed ignorance is not, but to the flesh ignorance is proper, as has been said. And that this is really so, observe how the Lord who inquired where Lazarus lay, Himself said, when He was not on the spot but a great way off, `Lazarus is dead[fn-68-P6834_2710384:289-nf] ,' and where he was dead; and how that He who is considered by them as ignorant, is He Himself who foreknew the reasonings of the disciples, and was aware of what was in the heart of each, and of `what was in man,' and, what is greater, alone knows the Father and says, `I in the Father and the Father in Me.[fn-68-P6835_2710713:290-nf] '","index":"58","references":[{"fn":"68","code":"P6829_2708621","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Vid. infr. 46; John xi. 34.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":11,"verses":[34]},{"book":"john","chapter":11,"verses":[34]}]},{"fn":"68","code":"P6830_2708816","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Matt. xvi. 13; Mark vi. 38; Matt. xx. 32.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[13]},{"book":"mark","chapter":6,"verses":[38]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":20,"verses":[32]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[13]},{"book":"mark","chapter":6,"verses":[38]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":20,"verses":[32]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[13]},{"book":"mark","chapter":6,"verses":[38]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":20,"verses":[32]}]},{"fn":"68","code":"P6831_2708924","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"ii. 44, n. 1.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"68","code":"P6832_2709418","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"John vi. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":6,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"68","code":"P6833_2709850","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Petavius refers to this passage in proof that S.

Therefore this is plain to every one, that the flesh indeed is ignorant, but the Word Himself, considered as the Word, knows all things even before they come to be. For He did not, when He became man, cease to be God[fn-68-P6837_2710969:291-nf] ; nor, whereas He is God does He shrink from what is man's; perish the thought; but rather, being God, He has taken to Him the flesh, and being in the flesh deifies the flesh. For as He asked questions in it, so also in it did He raise the dead; and He shewed to all that He who quickens the dead and recalls the soul, much more discerns the secret of all. And He knew where Lazarus lay, and yet He asked; for the All-holy Word of God, who endured all things for our sakes, did this, that so carrying our ignorance, He might vouchsafe to us the knowledge of His own only and true Father, and of Himself, sent because of us for the salvation of all, than which no grace could be greater. When then the Saviour uses the words which they allege in their defence, `Power is given to Me,' and, `Glorify Thy Son,' and Peter says, `Power is given unto Him,' we understand all these passages in the same sense, that humanly because of the body He says all this. For though He had no need, nevertheless He is said to have received what He received humanly, that on the other hand, inasmuch as the Lord has received, and the grant is lodged with Him, the grace may remain sure. For while mere man receives, he is liable to lose again (as was shewn in the case of Adam, for he received and he lost[fn-68-P6838_2712281:292-nf] ), but that the grace may be irrevocable, and may be kept sure[fn-68-P6839_2712363:293-nf] by men, therefore He Himself appropriates[fn-68-P6840_2712426:294-nf] the gift; and He says that He has received power, as man, which He ever had as God, and He says, `Glorify Me,' who glorifies others, to shew that He hath a flesh which has need of these things.

For if the Word Himself, considered as Word, has received andbeen glorified for His own sake, and if He according to His Godhead is He who is hallowed and has risen again, what hope is there for men? for they remain as they were, naked, and wretched, and dead, having no interest in the things given to the Son. Why too did the Word come among us, and become flesh? if that He might receive these things, which He says that He has received, He was without them before that, and of necessity will rather owe thanks Himself to the body[fn-68-P6842_2713823:295-nf] , because, when He came into it, then He receives these things from the Father, which He had not before His descent into the flesh.

But if that He might redeem mankind[fn-68-P6844_2714173:297-nf] , the Word did come among us; and that He might hallow and deify them, the Word became flesh (and for this He did become), who does not see that it follows, that what He says that He received, when He became flesh, that He mentions, not for His own sake, but for the flesh? for to it, in which He was speaking, pertained the gifts given through Him from the Father.

And again, that what He said that He had received, that He possessed before receiving it, appears from His driving away the demons, and from His un-binding what Satan had bound, as He did in the case of the daughter of Abraham; and from His remitting sins, saying to the paralytic, and to the woman who washed His feet, `Thy sins be forgiven thee[fn-68-P6852_2716149:304-nf] ;' and from His both raising the dead, and repairing the first nature of the blind, granting to him to see.

It is observable that epiplhttei and epitima are the words used by Cyril, &c. (infr. §54, note 4), for our Lord's treatment of His own sacred body.

He said He knew not for our profit, that we be not curious (as in Acts i. 7, where on the contrary He did not say He knew not).

But I, when the heretics allege it and prepare themselves with it, see in them the giants[fn-68-P6867_2722274:314-nf] again fighting against God. For the Lord of heaven and earth, by whom all things were made, has to litigate before them about day and hour; and the Word who knows all things is accused by them of ignorance about a day; and the Son who knows the Father is said to be ignorant of an hour of a day; now what can be spoken more contrary to sense, or what madness can be likened to this? Through the Word all things have been made, times and seasons and night and day and the whole creation; and is the Framer of all said to be ignorant of His work? And the very context of the lection shews that the Son of God knows that hour and that day, though the Arians fall headlong in their ignorance. For after saying, `nor-the Son,' He relates to the disciples what precedes the day, saying, `This and that shall be, and then the end.' But He who speaks of what precedes the day, knows certainly the day also, which shall be manifested subsequently to the things foretold. But if He had not known the hour, He had not signified the events before it, as not knowing when it should be. And as any one, who, by way of pointing out a house or city to those who were ignorant of it, gave an account of what comes before the house or city, and having described all, said, `Then immediately comes the city or the house,' would know of course where the house or the city was (for had he not known, he had not described what comes before lest from ignorance he should throw his hearers far out of the way, or in speaking he should unawares go beyond the object), so the Lord saying what precedes that day and that hour, knows exactly, nor is ignorant, when the hour and the day are at hand.","index":"65","references":[{"fn":"68","code":"P6865_2721166","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Mark xiii. 32.

Now why it was that, though He knew, He did not tell His disciples plainly at that time, no one may be curious[fn-68-P6869_2724104:315-nf] where He has been silent; for `Who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been His counsellor[fn-68-P6870_2724226:316-nf] ?' but why, though He knew, He said, `no, not the Son knows,' this I think none of the faithful is ignorant, viz. that He made this as those other declarations as man by reason of the flesh. For this as before is not the Word's deficiency[fn-68-P6871_2724485:317-nf] , but of that human nature[fn-68-P6872_2724530:318-nf] whose property it is to be ignorant. And this again will be weIl seen by honestly examining into the occasion, when and to whom the Saviour spoke thus. Not then when the heaven was made by Him, nor when He was with the Father Himself, the Word `disposing all things[fn-68-P6873_2724821:319-nf] ,' nor before He became man did He say it, but when `the Word became flesh[fn-68-P6874_2724924:320-nf] .' On this account it is reasonable to ascribe to His manhood everything which, after He became man, He speaks humanly. For it is proper to the Word to know what was made, nor be ignorant either of the beginning or of the end of these (for the works are His), and He knows how many things He wrought, and the limit of their consistence. And knowing of each the beginning and the end, He knows surely the general and common end of all. Certainly when He says in the Gospel concerning Himself in His human character, `Father, the hour is come, glorify Thy Son[fn-68-P6875_2725501:321-nf] ,' it is plain that He knows also the hour of the end of all things, as the Word, though as man He is ignorant of it, for ignorance is proper to man[fn-68-P6876_2725670:322-nf] , and especially ignorance of these things. Moreover this is proper to the Saviour's love of man; for since He was made man, He is not ashamed, because of the flesh which is ignorant[fn-68-P6877_2727888:323-nf] , to say `I know not,' that He may shew that knowing as God, He is but ignorant according to the flesh[fn-68-P6878_2728007:324-nf] .

For that Son whom He declares not to know the day, Him He declares to know the Father; for `No one,' He says, `knoweth the Father save the Son[fn-68-P6882_2731470:327-nf] .' And all men but the Arians would join in confessing, that He who knows the Father, much more knows the whole of the creation; and in that whole, its end. And if already the day and the hour be determined by the Father, it is plain that through the Son are they determined, and He knows Himself what through Him has been determined[fn-68-P6883_2731824:328-nf] , for there is nothing but has come to be and has been determined through the Son. Therefore He, being the Framer of the universe, knows of what nature, and of what magnitude, and with what limits, the Father has willed it to be made; and in the how much and how far is included its period. And again, if all that is the Father's, is the Son's (and this He Himself has[fn-68-P6884_2732224:329-nf] said), and it is the Father's attribute to know the day, it is plain that the Son too knows it, having this proper to Him from the Father. And again, if the Son be in the Father and the Father in the Son, and the Father knows the day and the hour, it is clear that the Son, being in the Father and knowing the things of the Father, knows Himself also the day and the hour. And if the Son is also the Father's Very Image, and the Father knows the day and the hour, it is plain that the Son has this likeness[fn-68-P6885_2732752:330-nf] also to the Father of knowing them. And it is not wonderful if He, through whom all things were made, and in whom the universe consists, Himself knows what has been brought to be, and when the end will be of each and of all together; rather is it wonderful that this audacity, suitable as it is to the madness of the Ariomaniacs, should have forced us to have recourse to so long a defence. For ranking the Son of God, the Eternal Word, among things originate, they are not far from venturing to maintain that the Father Himself is second to the creation; for if He who knows the Father knows not the day nor the hour, I fear lest the knowledge of the creation, or rather of the lower portion of it, be greater, as they in their madness would say, than knowledge concerning the Father.","index":"67","references":[{"fn":"68","code":"P6880_2729471","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Or. i. 47; Serap. i. 20 fin.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"68","code":"P6881_2729684","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Leporius, in his Retractation, which S.

This is sufficient to confute them; but to shew still further that they are hostile to the truth and Christ's enemies, I could wish to ask them a question. The Apostle in the Second Epistle to the Corinthians writes, `I knew a man in Christ, above fourteen years ago, whether in the body I do not know, or whether out of the body I do not know; God knoweth[fn-69-P6901_2742751:343-nf] .' What now say ye? Knew the Apostle what had happened to him in the vision, though he says `I know not,' or knew he not? If he knew not, see to it, lest, being familiar with error, ye err in the trespass[fn-69-P6902_2743123:344-nf] of the Phrygians[fn-69-P6903_2743168:345-nf] , who say that the Prophets and the other ministers of the Word know neither what they do nor concerning what they announce. But if he knew when he said `I know not,' for he had Christ within him revealing to him all things, is not the heart of God's enemies indeed perverted and `self-condemned?' for when the Apostle says, `I know not,' they say that he knows; but when the Lord says, `I know not,' they say that He does not know. For if since Christ was within him, Paul knew that of which he says, `I know not,' does not much more Christ Himself know, though He say, `I know not?' The Apostle then, the Lord revealing it to him, knew what happened to him; for on this account he says, `I knew a man in Christ;' and knowing the man, he knew also how the man was caught away. Thus Elisha, who beheld Elijah, knew also how he was taken up; but though knowing, yet when the sons of the Prophets thought that Elijah was cast upon one of the mountains by the Spirit, he knowing from the first what he had seen, tried to persuade them; but when they urged it, he was silent, and suffered them to go after him. Did he then not know, because he was silent? he knew indeed, but as if not knowing, he suffered them, that they being convinced, might no more doubt about the taking up of Elijah. Therefore much more Paul, himself being the person caught away, knew also how he was caught; for Elijah knew; and had any one asked, he would have said how. And yet Paul says `I know not,' for these two reasons, as I think at least; one, as he has said himself, lest because of the abundance of the revelations any one should think of him beyond what he saw; the other, because, our Saviour having said `I know not,' it became him also to say `I know not,' lest the servant should appear above his Lord, and the disciple above his Master.","index":"70","references":[{"fn":"69","code":"P6901_2742751","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"2 Cor. xii. 2.

Why then said He at that time `I know not,' what He as Lord[fn-69-P6905_2745912:346-nf] , knew? as we may by searching conjecture, for our profit[fn-69-P6906_2745995:347-nf] , as I think at least, did He this; and may He grant to what we are now proposing a true meaning! On both sides did the Saviour secure our advantage; for He has made known what comes before the end, that, as He said Himself, we might not be startled nor scared, when they happen, but from them may expect the end after them. And concerning the day and the hour He was not willing to say according to His divine nature, `I know,' but after the flesh, `I know not,' for the sake of the flesh which was ignorant[fn-69-P6907_2746771:348-nf] , as I have said before; lest they should ask Him further, and then either He should have to pain the disciples by not speaking, or by speaking might act to the prejudice of them and us all. For whatever He does, that altogether He does for our sakes, since also for us `the Word became flesh.' For us therefore He said `No, not the Son knoweth;' and neither was He untrue in thus saying (for He said humanly, as man, `I know not'), nor did He suffer the disciples to force Him to speak, for by saying `I know not' He stopped their inquiries. And so in the Acts of the Apostles it is written, when He went upon the Angels, ascending as man, and carrying up to heaven the flesh which He bore, on the disciples seeing this, and again asking, `When shall the end be, and when wilt Thou be present?' He said to them more clearly, `It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in His own power[fn-69-P6908_2747719:349-nf] .' And He did not then say, `No, not the Son,' as He said before humanly, but, `It is not for you to know.' For now the flesh had risen and put off its mortality and been deified; and no longer did it become Him to answer after the flesh when He was going into the heavens; but henceforth to teach after a divine manner, `It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father hath put in His own power; but ye shall receive Power[fn-69-P6909_2748173:350-nf] .'

For it is profitable to you to hear so much both of the Angels and of the Son, because of the deceivers which shall be afterwards; that though demons should be transfigured as Angels, and should attempt to speak concerning the end, you should not believe, since they are ignorant; and that, if Antichrist too, disguising himself, should say, `I am Christ,' and should try in his turn to speak of that day and end, to deceive the hearers, ye, having these words from Me, `No, not the Son,' may disbelieve him also.

This then is the passage, and since they stumble in it, we are compelled to ask them, like the Pharisees and the Sadducees, of the person concerning whom Luke speaks. And the case stands thus. Is Jesus Christ man, as all other men, or is He God bearing flesh? If then He is an ordinary[fn-69-P6924_2753650:362-nf] man as the rest, then let Him, as a man, advance; this however is the sentiment of the Samosatene, which virtually indeed you entertain also, though in name you deny it because of men.

For if He who was ever in the Father, advanced, what, I ask, is there beyond the Father from which His advance might be made? Next it is suitable here to repeat what was said upon the point of His receiving and being glorified. If He advanced[fn-69-P6925_2754310:363-nf] when He became man, it is plain that, before He became man, He was imperfect; and rather the flesh Became to Him a cause of perfection, than He to the flesh. And again, if, as being the Word, He advances, what has He more to become than Word and Wisdom and Son and God's Power? For the Word is all these, of which if one can anyhow partake as it were one ray, such a man becomes all perfect among men, and equal to Angels. For Angels, and Archangels, and Dominions, and all the Powers, and Thrones, as partaking the Word, behold always the face of His Father. How then does He who to others supplies perfection, Himself advance later than they? For Angels even ministered to His human birth, and the passage from Luke comes later than the ministration of the Angels. How then at all can it even come into thought of man? or how did Wisdom advance in wisdom? or how did He who to others gives grace (as Paul says in every Epistle, knowing that through Him grace is given, `The grace · of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all'), how did He advance in grace? for either let them say that the Apostle is untrue, and presume to say that the Son is not Wisdom, or else if He is Wisdom as Solomon said, and if Paul wrote, `Christ God's Power and God's Wisdom,' of what advance did Wisdom admit further?","index":"74","references":[{"fn":"69","code":"P6923_2753341","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Luke ii. 52.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":2,"verses":[52]}]},{"fn":"69","code":"P6924_2753650","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"§32, n. 7.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"69","code":"P6925_2754310","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"De Syn. 24, n. 9, vid. supr. §39; Orat. iv. 11.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"52.

And our increase is no other than the renouncing things sensible, and coming to the Word Himself; since His humbling is nothing else than His taking our flesh. It was not then the Word, considered as the Word, who advanced; who is perfect from the perfect Father[fn-69-P6931_2757324:368-nf] , who needs nothing, nay brings forward others to an advance; but humanly is He here also said to advance, since advance belongs to man[fn-69-P6932_2757485:369-nf] .

For in the incorporeal, the properties of body had not been, unless He had taken a body corruptible and mortal[fn-69-P6969_2767505:399-nf] ; for mortal was Holy Mary, from whom was His body. Wherefore of necessity when He was in a body suffering, and weeping, and toiling, these things which are proper to the flesh, are ascribed to Him together with the body. If then He wept and was troubled, it was not the Word, considered as the Word, who wept and was troubled, but it was proper to the flesh; and if too He besought that the cup might pass away, it was not the Godhead that was in terror, but this affection too was proper to the manhood. And that the words `Why hast Thou forsaken Me?' are His, according to the foregoing explanations (though He suffered nothing, for the Word was impossible), is notwithstanding declared by the Evangelists; since the Lord became man, and these things are done and said as from a man, that He might Himself lighten[fn-69-P6970_2768413:400-nf] these very sufferings of the flesh, and free it from them[fn-69-P6971_2768493:401-nf] .

For Ptolemy the Valentinian said that the Unoriginate had a pair of attributes, Thought and Will, and first He thought and then He willed; and what He thought, He could not put forth[fn-70-P7014_2786008:435-nf] , unless when the power of the Will was added. Thence the Arians taking a lesson, wish will and pleasure to precede the Word. For them then, let them rival the doctrine of Valentinus; but we, when we read the divine discourses, found `He was' applied to the Son, but of Him only did we hear as being in the Father and the Father's Image; while in the case of things originate only, since also by nature these things once were not, but afterwards came to be[fn-70-P7015_2786502:436-nf] , did we recognise a precedent will and pleasure, David saying in the hundred and thirteenth Psalm, `As for our God He is in heaven, He hath done whatsoever pleased Him,' and in the hundred and tenth, `The works of the Lord are great, sought out unto all His good pleasure;' and again, in the hundred and thirty-fourth, `Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did He in heaven, and in earth, and in the sea, and in all deep places[fn-70-P7016_2786972:437-nf] .'

Or if it be befitting God to will, then let this better way obtain in the case of the first Offspring. For it is not possible that it should be fitting for one and the same God to make things at His pleasure, and not at His will also.' In spite of the Sophist having introduced abundant irreligion in his words, namely, that the Offspring and the thing made are the same, and that the Son is one offspring out of all offsprings that are, He ends with the conclusion that it is fitting to say that the works are by will and pleasure.","index":"89","references":[{"fn":"70","code":"P7013_2784673","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"prohgoumenhn and 61 fin.

For Paul, whereas he was not before, became afterwards an Apostle `by the will of God[fn-70-P7020_2788345:440-nf] ;' and our own calling, as itself once not being, but now taking place afterwards, is preceded by will, and, as Paul himself says again, has been made `according to the good pleasure of His will[fn-70-P7021_2788564:441-nf] .' And what Moses relates, `Let there be light,' and `Let the earth appear,' and `Let Us make man,' is, I think, according to what has gone before[fn-70-P7022_2788729:442-nf] , significant of the will of the Agent. For things which once were not but happened afterwards from external causes, these the Framer counsels to make; but His own Word begotten from Him by nature, concerning Him He did not counsel beforehand; for in Him the Father makes, in Him frames, other things whatever He counsels; as also James the Apostle teaches, saying, `Of His own will begat He us with the Word of truth[fn-70-P7023_2789167:443-nf] .' Therefore the Will of God concerning all things, whether they be begotten again or are brought into being at the first, is in His Word, in whom He both makes and begets again what seems right to Him; as the Apostle[fn-70-P7024_2789405:444-nf] again signifies, writing to Thessalonica; `for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.' But if, in whom He makes, in Him also is the will, and in Christ is the pleasure of the Father, how can He, as others, come into being by will and pleasure? For if He too came to be as you maintain, by will, it follows that the will concerning Him consists in some other Word, through whom He in turn comes to be; for it has been shewn that God's will is not in the things which He brings into being, but in Him through whom and in whom all things made are brought to be. Next, since it is all one to say `By will' and Once He was not,' let them make up their minds to say, `Once He was not,' that, perceiving with shame that times are signified by the latter, they may understand that to say `by will' is to place times before the Son; for counselling goes before things which once were not, as in the case of all creatures. But if the Word is the Framer of the creatures, and He coexists with the Father, how can to counsel precede the Everlasting as if He were not? for if counsel precedes, how through Him are all things? For rather He too, as one among others is by will begotten to be a Son, as we too were made sons by the Word of Truth; and it rests, as was said, to seek another Word, through whom He too has come to be, and was begotten together with all things, which were according to God's pleasure.","index":"90","references":[{"fn":"70","code":"P7019_2788070","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Cf. ii. 18-43.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"70","code":"P7020_2788345","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"i Cor. i. 1, &C.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"70","code":"P7021_2788564","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Eph. 1. 5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"ephesians","chapter":1,"verses":[5]}]},{"fn":"70","code":"P7022_2788729","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"ii. 31 seqq.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"70","code":"P7023_2789167","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"James i. 18.","bible_refs":[{"book":"james","chapter":1,"verses":[18]}]},{"fn":"70","code":"P7024_2789405","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"1 Thess. v 18.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"62.

And who is it then who imposes necessity on Him, O men most wicked, who draw everything to the purpose of your heresy? for what is contrary to will they see; but what is greater and transcends it has escaped their perception.

For let them tell us themselves,-that God is good and merciful, does this attach to Him by will or not? if by will, we must consider that He began to be good, and that His not being good is possible; for to counsel and choose implies an inclination two ways, and is incidental to a rational nature. But if it be too unseemly that He should be called good and merciful upon will, then what they have said themselves must be retorted on them,-`therefore by necessity and not at His pleasure He is good;' and, `who is it that imposes this necessity on Him?'

But if such a question be unseemly and self-destructive, and shocking even to ask (for it is enough only to hear God's Name for us to know and understand that He is He that Is), will it not also be against reason to have parallel thoughts concerning the Word of God, and to make pretences of will and pleasure? for it is enough in like manner only to hear the Name of the Word, to know and understand that He who is God not by will, has not by will but by nature His own Word. And does it not surpass all conceivable madness, to entertain the thought only, that God Himself counsels and considers and chooses and proceeds to have a good pleasure, that He be not without Word and without Wisdom, but have both? for He seems to be considering about Himself, who counsels about what is proper to His Essence. There being then much blasphemy in such a thought, it will be religious to say that things originate have come to be `by favour and will,' but the Son is not a work of will, nor has come after[fn-70-P7031_2796903:449-nf] , as the creation, but is by nature the own Offspring of God's Essence. For being the own Word of the Father, He allows us not to account[fn-70-P7032_2797071:450-nf] of will as before Himself, since He is Himself the Father's Living Counsel[fn-70-P7033_2797211:451-nf] , and Power, and Framer of the things which seemed good to the Father. And this is what He says of Himself in the Proverbs; `Counsel is mine and security, mine is understanding, and mine strength[fn-70-P7034_2797840:452-nf] .' For as, although Himself the `Understanding,' in which He prepared the heavens, and Himself `Strength and Power' (for Christ is `God's Power and God's Wisdom[fn-70-P7035_2798024:453-nf] ), He here has altered the terms and said, `Mine is understanding' and `Mine strength,' so while He says, `Mine is counsel,' He must Himself be the Living[fn-70-P7036_2798200:454-nf] Counsel of the Father; as we have learned from the Prophet also, that He becomes `the Angel of great Counsel[fn-70-P7037_2798647:455-nf] ,' and was called the good pleasure of the Father; for thus we must refute them, using human illustrations[fn-70-P7038_2798772:456-nf] concerning God.","index":"92","references":[{"fn":"70","code":"P7030_2795235","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Vid.

Therefore if the works subsist `by will and favour,' and the whole creature is made `at God's good pleasure,' and Paul was called to be an Apostle `by the will of God,' and our calling has come about `by His good pleasure and will,' and all things have come into being through the Word, He is external to the things which have come to be by will, but rather is Himself the Living Counsel of the Father, by which all these things have come to be; by which David also gives thanks in the seventy-second Psalm. `Thou hast holden me by my right hand; Thou shall guide me with Thy Counsel[fn-70-P7040_2799402:457-nf] .'

Is it not irreligious then to impute the characteristics of things originate to the Framer of all? and is it not blasphemous to say that will was in the Father before the Word? for if will precedes in the Father, the Son's words are not true, `I in the Father;' or even if He is in the Father, yet He will hold but a second place, and it became Him not to say `I in the Father,' since will was before Him, in which all things were brought into being and He Himself subsisted, as you hold.

Moreover, if they say that the Son is by will, they should say also that He came to be by understanding; for I consider understanding and will to be the same. For what a man counsels, about that also he has understanding; and what he has in understanding, that also he counsels. Certainly the Saviour Himself has made them correspond, as being cognate, when He says, `Counsel is mine and security; mine is understanding, and mine strength[fn-70-P7048_2802245:464-nf] .' For as strength and security are the same (for they mean one attribute), so we may say that Understanding and Counsel are the same, which is the Lord. But these irreligious men are unwilling that the Son should be Word and Living Counsel; but they fable that there is with God[fn-70-P7049_2802548:465-nf] , as if a habit[fn-70-P7050_2802733:466-nf] , coming and going[fn-70-P7051_2802801:467-nf] , after the manner of men, understanding, counsel, wisdom; and they leave nothing undone, and they put forward the `Thought' and `Will' of Valentinus, so that they may but separate the Son from the Father, and may call Him a creature instead of the proper Word of the Father. To them then must be said what was said to Simon Magus; `the irreligion of Valentinus perish with you[fn-70-P7052_2803386:468-nf] ;' and let every one rather trust to Solomon, who says, that the Word is Wisdom and Understanding. For he says, `The Lord by Wisdom founded the earth, by Understanding He established the heavens.' And as here by Understanding, so in the Psalms, `By the Word of the Lord were the heavens made.' And as by the Word the heavens, so `He hath done whatsoever pleased Him.' And as the Apostle writes to Thessalonians, `the will of God is in Christ Jesus[fn-70-P7053_2803856:469-nf] .' The Son of God then, He is the `Word' and the `Wisdom;' He the `Understanding' and the Living `Counsel;' and in Him is the `Good Pleasure of the Father;' He is `Truth' and `Light' and `Power' of the Father. But if the Will of God is Wisdom and Understanding, and the Son is Wisdom, he who says that the Son is `by will,' says virtually that Wisdom has come into being in wisdom, and the Son is made in a son, and the Word created through the Word[fn-70-P7054_2804385:470-nf] ; which is incompatible with God and is opposed to His Scriptures. For the Apostle proclaims the Son to be the own Radiance and Expression, not of the Father's will[fn-70-P7055_2804590:471-nf] , but of His Essence[fn-70-P7056_2804636:472-nf] Itself, saying, `Who being the Radiance of His glory and the Expression of His Subsistence[fn-70-P7057_2805361:473-nf] .' But if, as we have said before, the Father's Essence and Subsistence be not from will, neither, as is very plain, is what is proper to the Father's Subsistence from will; for such as, and so as, that Blessed Subsistence, must also be the proper Offspring from It. And accordingly the Father Himself said not, `This is the Son originated at My will,' nor `the Son whom I have by My favour,' but simply `My Son,' and more than that, `in whom I am well pleased;' meaning by this, This is the Son by nature; and `in Him is lodged My will about what pleases Me.'","index":"94","references":[{"fn":"70","code":"P7048_2802245","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Prov. viii. 14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","chapter":8,"verses":[14]}]},{"fn":"70","code":"P7049_2802548","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"peri ton qeon. vid. de Decr. 22, n. 1; Or. i. 15.

No, verily; but the Son is with the pleasure of the Father, and, as He says Himself, `The Father loveth the Son, and sheweth Him all things[fn-70-P7059_2806205:474-nf] .' For as not `from will' did He begin to be good, nor yet is good without will and pleasure (for what He is, that also is His pleasure), so also that the Son should be, though it came not `from will,' yet it is not without His pleasure or against His purpose. For as His own Subsistence is by His pleasure, so also the Son, being proper to His Essence, is not without His pleasure. Be then the Son the object of the Father's pleasure and love; and thus let every one religiously account of[fn-70-P7060_2806729:475-nf] the pleasure and the not-unwillingness of God. For by that good pleasure wherewith the Son is the object of the Father's pleasure, is the Father the object of the Son's love, pleasure, and honour; and one is the good pleasure which is from Father in Son, so that here too we may contemplate the Son in the Father and the Father in the Son. Let no one then, with Valentinus, introduce a precedent will; nor let any one, by this pretence of `counsel,' intrude between the Only Father and the Only Word; for it were madness to place will and consideration between them. For it is one thing to say, `Of will He came to be,' and another, that the Father has love and good pleasure towards His Son who is His own by nature. For to say, `Of will He came to be,' in the first place implies that once He was not; and next it implies an inclination two ways, as has been said, so that one might suppose that the Father could even not will the Son. But to say of the Son, `He might not have been,' is an irreligious presumption reaching even to the Essence of the Father, as if what is His own might not have been. For it is the same as saying, `The Father might not have been good.' And as the Father is always good by nature, so He is always generative[fn-70-P7061_2807990:476-nf] by nature; and to say, `The Father's good pleasure is the Son,' and `The Word's good pleasure is the Father,' implies, not a precedent will, but genuineness of nature, and propriety and likeness of Essence. For as in the case of the radiance and light one might say, that there is no will preceding radiance in the light, but it is its natural offspring, at the pleasure of the light which begat it, not by will and consideration, but in nature and truth, so also in the instance of the Father and the Son, one might rightly say, that the Father has love and good pleasure towards the Son, and the Son has love and good pleasure towards the Father.","index":"95","references":[{"fn":"70","code":"P7059_2806205","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"John iii. 35; John v. 20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":3,"verses":[35]},{"book":"john","chapter":5,"verses":[20]},{"book":"john","chapter":3,"verses":[35]},{"book":"john","chapter":5,"verses":[20]}]},{"fn":"70","code":"P7060_2806729","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"63, n. 3.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"70","code":"P7061_2807990","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Or. i. 14, n. 4; ii. 2, n. 3.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"67.

But if the Word be in the heart, where is will? and if the Son in the Father, where is good pleasure? and if He be Will Himself, how is counsel in Will? it is unseemly; lest the Word come into being in a word, and the Son in a son, and Wisdom in a wisdom, as has been repeatedly[fn-70-P7064_2809327:478-nf] said. For the Son is the Father's All; and nothing was in the Father before the Word; but in the Word is will also, and through Him the objects of will are carried into effect, as holy Scriptures have shewn. And I could wish that the irreligious men, having fallen into such want of reason[fn-70-P7065_2809638:479-nf] as to be considering about will, would now ask their childbearing women no more, whom they used to ask, `Hadst thou a son before conceiving him[fn-70-P7066_2809807:480-nf] ?' but the father, `Do ye become fathers by counsel, or by the natural law of your will?' or `Are your children like your nature and essence[fn-70-P7067_2809966:481-nf] ?' that, even from fathers they may learn shame, from whom they assumed this proposition[fn-70-P7068_2810151:482-nf] about birth, and from whom they hoped to gain knowledge in point. For they will reply to them, `What we beget, is like, not our good pleasure[fn-70-P7069_2810318:483-nf] , but like ourselves; nor become we parents by previous counsel, but to beget is proper to our nature; since we too are images of our fathers.' Either then let them condemn themselves[fn-70-P7070_2810520:484-nf] , and cease asking women about the Son of God, or let them learn from them, that the Son is begotten not by will, but in nature and truth. Becoming and suitable to them is a refutation from human instances[fn-70-P7071_2810788:485-nf] , since the perverse-minded men dispute in a human way concerning the Godhead. Why then are Christ's enemies still mad? for this, as well as their other pretences, is shewn and proved to be mere fantasy and fable; and on this account, they ought, however late, contemplating the precipice of folly down which they have fallen, to rise again from the depth and to flee the snare of the devil, as we admonish them. For Truth is loving unto men and cries continually, `If because of My clothing of the body ye believe Me not, yet believe the works, that ye may know that \"I am in the Father and the Father in Me,\" and \"I and the Father are one,\" and \"He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father[fn-70-P7072_2811499:486-nf] .\"' But the Lord according to His wont is loving to man, and would fain `help them that are fallen,' as the praise of David[fn-70-P7073_2811681:487-nf] says; but the irreligious men, not desirous to hear the Lord's voice, nor bearing to see Him acknowledged by all as God and God's Son, go about, miserable men, as beetles, seeking with their father the devil pretexts for irreligion. What pretexts then, and whence will they be able next to find? unless they borrow blasphemies of Jews and Caiaphas, and take atheism from Gentiles? for the divine Scriptures are closed to them, and from every part of them they are refuted as insensate and Christ's enemies.","index":"96","references":[{"fn":"70","code":"P7063_2809012","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Ps. xlv. 1; John xiv. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":45,"verses":[1]},{"book":"john","chapter":14,"verses":[10]},{"book":"psalms","chapter":45,"verses":[1]},{"book":"john","chapter":14,"verses":[10]}]},{"fn":"70","code":"P7064_2809327","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"§2, n. 6, &c.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"70","code":"P7065_2809638","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"De Decr. i. n. 6.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"70","code":"P7066_2809807","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Or. i. 26.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"70","code":"P7067_2809966","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"thj ousiaj omoia, vid.
