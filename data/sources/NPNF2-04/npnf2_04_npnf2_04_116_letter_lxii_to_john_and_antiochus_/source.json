I thank you for informing me about the brethren that there assembled, and about those who wish, on account of disputed points, to disturb the simple. But about these things let the Apostle charge them not to give heed to those who contend about words, and seek nothing else than to tell and hear some new thing[fn-101-P10165_3636593:2-nf] . But do you, having your foundation sure, even Jesus Christ our Lord, and the confession of the fathers concerning the faith, avoid those who wish to say anything more or less than that, and rather aim at the profit of the brethren, that they may fear God and keep His commandments, in order that both by the teaching of the fathers, and by the keeping of the commandments, they may be able to appear well-pleasing to the Lord in the day of judgment. But I have been utterly astonished at the boldness of those who venture to speak against our beloved Basil the bishop, a true servant of God. For from such vain talk they can be convicted of not loving even the confession of the fathers.","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"101","code":"P10165_3636593","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"2 Tim. ii. 14; Acts xvii. 21.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 timothy","chapter":2,"verses":[14]},{"book":"the acts","chapter":17,"verses":[21]},{"book":"2 timothy","chapter":2,"verses":[14]},{"book":"the acts","chapter":17,"verses":[21]}]}]},{"text":"Greet the brethren.
