Of all other heresies which have departed from the truth it is acknowledged that they have but devised[fn-52-P5260_2056518:1-nf] a madness, and their irreligiousness has long since become notorious to all men. For that[fn-52-P5261_2057339:2-nf] their authors went out from us, it plainly follows, as the blessed John has written, that they never thought nor now think with us. Wherefore, as saith the Saviour, in that they gather not with us, they scatter with the devil, and keep an eye on those who slumber, that, by this second sowing of their own mortal poison, they may have companions in death. But, whereas one heresy, and that the last, which has now risen as harbinger[fn-52-P5262_2057871:3-nf] of Antichrist, the Arian, as it is called, considering that other heresies, her eider sisters, have been openly proscribed, in her craft and cunning, affects to array herself in Scripture language[fn-52-P5263_2058082:4-nf] , like her father the devil, and is forcing her way back into the Church's paradise,-that with the pretence of Christianity, her smooth sophistry (for reason she has none) may deceive men into wrong thoughts of Christ,-nay, since she has already seduced certain of the foolish, not only to corrupt their ears, but even to take and eat with Eve, till in their ignorance which ensues they think bitter sweet, and admire this loathsome heresy, on this account I have thought it necessary, at your request, to unrip `the folds of its breast-plate[fn-52-P5264_2060293:5-nf] ,' and to shew the ill savour of its folly. So while those who are far from it may continue to shun it, those whom it has deceived may repent; and, opening the eyes of their heart, may understand that darkness is not light, nor falsehood truth, nor Arianism good; nay, that those[fn-52-P5265_2060600:6-nf] who call these men Christians are in great and grievous error, as neither having studied Scripture, nor understanding Christianity at all, and the faith which it contains.","index":"17","references":[{"fn":"52","code":"P5260_2056518","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"But see Bigg.

For what have they discovered in this heresy like to the religious Faith, that they vainly talk as if its supporters said no evil? This in truth is to call even Caiaphas[fn-52-P5267_2061892:7-nf] a Christian, and to reckon the traitor Judas still among the Apostles, and to say that they who asked Barabbas instead of the Saviour did no evil, and to recommend Hymenaeus and Alexander as right-minded men, and as if the Apostle slandered them. But neither can a Christian bear to hear this, nor can he consider the man who dared to say it sane in his understanding. For with them for Christ is Arius, as with the Manichees Manichaeus; and for Moses and the other saints they have made the discovery of one Sotades[fn-52-P5268_2062435:8-nf] , a man whom even Gentiles laugh at, and of the daughter of Herodias. For of the one has Arius imitated the dissolute and effeminate tone, in writing Thaliae on his model; and the other he has rivalled in her dance, reeling and frolicking in his blasphemies against the Saviour; till the victims of his heresy lose their wits and go foolish, and change the Name of the Lord of glory into the likeness of the `image of corruptible man[fn-52-P5269_2062884:9-nf] ,' and for Christians come to be called Arians, bearing this badge of their irreligion.

Nor let them make a jest of it, when they feel shame at their disgraceful appellation; rather, if they be ashamed, let them hide their faces, or let them recoil from their own irreligion. For never at any time did Christian people take their title from the Bishops among them, but from the Lord, on whom we rest our faith. Thus, though the blessed Apostles have become our teachers, and have ministered the Saviour's Gospel, yet not from them have we our title, but from Christ we are and are named Christians.

Yes surely; while all of us are and are called Christians after Christ, Marcion broached a heresy a long time since and was cast out; and those who continued with him who ejected him remained Christians; but those who followed Marcion were called Christians no more, but henceforth Marcionites. Thus Valentinus also, and Basilides, and Manichaeus, and Simon Magus, have imparted their own name to their followers; and some are accosted as Valentinians, or as Basilidians, or as Manichees, or as Simonians; and other, Cataphrygians from Phrygia, and from Novatus Novatians. So too Meletius, when ejected by Peter the Bishop and Martyr, called his party no longer Christians, but Meletians[fn-52-P5273_2067636:12-nf] , and so in consequence when Alexander of blessed memory had cast out Arius, those who remained with Alexander, remained Christians; but those who went out with Arius, left the Saviour's Name to us who were with Alexander, and as to them they were hence-forward denominated Arians. Behold then, after Alexander's death too, those who communicate with his successor Athanasius, and those with whom the said Athanasius communicates, are instances of the same rule; none of them bear his name, nor is he named from them, but all in like manner, and as is usual, are called Christians. For though we have a succession of teachers and become their disciples, yet, because we are taught by them the things of Christ, we both are, and are called, Christians all the same. But those who follow the heretics, though they have innumerable successors in their heresy, yet anyhow bear the name of him who devised it. Thus, though Arius be dead, and many of his party have succeeded him, yet those who think with him, as being known from Arius, are called Arians. And, what is a remarkable evidence of this, those of the Greeks who even at this time come into the Church, on giving up the superstition of idols, take the name, not of their catechists, but of the Saviour, and begin to be called Christians instead of Greeks: while those of them who go off to the heretics, and again all who from the Church change to this heresy, abandon Christ's name, and henceforth are called Arians, as no longer holding Christ's faith, but having inherited Arius's madness.","index":"19","references":[{"fn":"52","code":"P5273_2067636","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Prolegg. ch. ii. §2.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"4.

And hence a man may marvel, that, whereas many have written many treatises and abundant homilies upon the Old Testament and the New, yet in none of them is a Thalia found nay nor among the more respectable of the Gentiles, but among those only who sing such strains over their cups, amid cheers and jokes, when men are merry, that the rest may laugh; till this marvellous Arius, taking no grave pattern, and ignorant even of what is respectable, while he stole largely from other heresies, would be original in the ludicrous, with none but Sotades for his rival.

Then, wishing to form us, thereupon He made a certain one, and named Him Word and Wisdom and Son, that He might form us by means of Him.'

Wherefore He is very God, existing one[fn-53-P5326_2088819:45-nf] in essence with the very Father; while other beings, to whom He said, `I said ye are Gods[fn-53-P5327_2088993:46-nf] ,' had this grace from the Father, only by participation[fn-53-P5328_2089070:47-nf] of the Word, through the Spirit.

If ye say the Father, your blasphemy is but greater; for it is impious to say that He was `once,' or to signify Him by the word `once.' For He is ever, and is now, and as the Son is, so is He, and is Himself He that is, and Father of the Son.

In this difficulty, you can but answer, that there was a time when the Word was not; for your very adverb `once' naturally signifies this.

Whence then this your discovery? Why do ye, as `the heathen, rage, and imagine vain phrases against the Lord[fn-53-P5348_2097288:62-nf] and against His Christ?' for no holy Scripture has used such language of the Saviour, but rather `always' and `eternal' and `coexistent always with the Father.'

Surely in these words he does not designate the Father, as ye often whisper one to another, affirming that the Father is `His eternal power.' This is not so; for he says not, `God Himself is the power,' but `His is the power.' Very plain is it to all that `His' is not `He;' yet not something alien but rather proper to Him.

It is plain then from the above that the Scriptures declare the Son's eternity; it is equally plain from what follows that the Arian phrases `He was not,' and `before' and `when,' are in the same Scriptures predicated of creatures. Moses, for instance, in his account of the generation of our system, says, `And every plant of the field, before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew; for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground[fn-53-P5372_2105783:84-nf] .'

But if such terms are used in Scripture of things originate, but `ever' of the Word, it follows, O ye enemies of God, that the Son did not come out of nothing, nor is in the number of originated things at all, but is the Father's Image and Word eternal, never having not been, but being ever, as the, eternal Radiance[fn-53-P5380_2107455:92-nf] of a Light which is eternal. Why imagine then times before the Son? or wherefore blaspheme the Word as after times, by whom even the ages were made? for how did time or age at all subsist when the Word, as you say, had not appeared, `through' whom `all things have been made and without' whom `not one thing was made[fn-53-P5381_2107798:93-nf] ?' Or why, when you mean time, do you not plainly say, `a time was when the Word was not?' But while you drop the word `time' to deceive the simple, you do not at all conceal your own feeling, nor, even if you did, could you escape discovery.

When these points are thus proved, their profaneness goes further. `If there never was, when the Son was not,' say they, `but He is eternal, and coexists with the Father, you call Him no more the Father's Son, but brother[fn-53-P5386_2108848:94-nf] .' O insensate and contentious! For if we said only that He was eternally with the Father, and not His Son, their pretended scruple would have some plausibility; but if, while we say that He is eternal, we also confess Him to be Son from the Father, how can He that is begotten be considered brother of Him who begets? And if our faith is in Father and Son, what brotherhood is there between them? and how can the Word be called brother of Him whose Word He is? This is not an objection of men really ignorant, for they comprehend how the truth lies; but it is a Jewish pretence, and that from those who, in Solomon's words, `through desire separate themselves[fn-53-P5387_2110238:95-nf] '0 from the truth. For the Father and the Son were not generated front some pre-existing origin[fn-53-P5388_2110355:96-nf] , that we may account Them brothers, but the Father is the Origin of the Son and begat Him; and the Father is Father, and not born the Son of any; and the Son is Son, and not brother. Further, if He is called the eternal offspring[fn-53-P5389_2110609:97-nf] of the Father, He is rightly so called. For never was the essence of the Father imperfect, that what is proper to it should be added afterwards[fn-53-P5390_2112583:98-nf] ; nor, as man from man, has the Son been begotten, so as to be later than His Father's existence, but He is God's offspring, and as being proper Son of God, who is ever, He exists eternally. For, whereas it is proper to men to beget in time, from the imperfection of their nature[fn-53-P5391_2112890:99-nf] , God's offspring is eternal, for His nature is ever perfect[fn-53-P5392_2112998:100-nf] . If then He is not a Son, but a work made out of nothing, they have but to prove it; and then they are at liberty, as if imagining about a creature, to cry out, `There was once when He was not;' for things which are originated were not, and have come to be. But if He is Son, as the Father says, and the Scriptures proclaim, and `Son' is nothing else than what is generated from the Father; and what is generated from the Father is His Word, and Wisdom, and Radiance; what is to be said but that, in maintaining `Once the Son was not,' they rob God of His Word, like plunderers, and openly predicate of Him that He was once without His proper Word and Wisdom, and that the Light was once without radiance, and the Fountain was once barren and dry[fn-53-P5393_2114765:101-nf] ?

And thus of the Son Himself, all things partake according to the grace of the Spirit coming from Him[fn-54-P5403_2119314:109-nf] ; and this shews that the Son Himself partakes of nothing, but what is partaken from the Father, is the Son; for, as partaking of the Son Himself, we are said to partake of God; and this is what Peter said `that ye may be partakers in a divine nature[fn-54-P5404_2119586:110-nf] ;' as says too the Apostle, `Know ye not, that ye are a temple of God?' and, `We are the temple of a living God[fn-54-P5405_2119717:111-nf] .' And beholding the Son, we see the Father; for the thought[fn-54-P5406_2119816:112-nf] and comprehension of the Son, is knowledge concerning the Father, because He is His proper offspring from His essence. And since to be partaken no one of us would ever call affection or division of God's essence (for it has been shewn and acknowledged that God is participated, and to be participated is the same thing as to beget); therefore that which is begotten is neither affection nor division of that blessed essence. Hence it is not incredible that God should have a Son, the Offspring of His own essence; nor do we imply affection or division of God's essence, when we speak of `Son' and `Offspring;' but rather, as acknowledging the genuine, and true, and Only-begotten of God, so we believe. If then, as we have stated and are shewing, what is the Offspring of the Father's essence be the Son, we cannot hesitate, rather we must be certain, that the same[fn-54-P5407_2120719:113-nf] is the Wisdom and Word of the Father, in and through whom He creates and makes all things; and His Brightness too, in whom He enlightens all things, and is revealed to whom He will; and His Expression and Image also, in whom He is contemplated and known, wherefore `He and His Father are one[fn-54-P5408_2121035:114-nf] ,' and whoso looketh on Him looketh on the Father; and the Christ, in whom all things are redeemed, and the new creation wrought afresh. And on the other hand, the Son being such Offspring, it is not fitting, rather it is full of peril, to say, that He is a work out of nothing, or that He was not before His generation. For he who thus speaks of that which is proper to the Father's essence, already blasphemes the Father Himself[fn-54-P5409_2121485:115-nf] ; since he really thinks of Him what he falsely imagines of His offspring.","index":"48","references":[{"fn":"54","code":"P5403_2119314","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"De Decr. §31.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"54","code":"P5404_2119586","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"2 Pet i. 4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 peter","chapter":1,"verses":[4]}]},{"fn":"54","code":"P5405_2119717","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"1 Cor. iii. 16; 2 Cor. vi. 16.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":3,"verses":[16]},{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":6,"verses":[16]},{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":3,"verses":[16]},{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":6,"verses":[16]}]},{"fn":"54","code":"P5406_2119816","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"ennoia, vid. de Syn. §48 fin.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"54","code":"P5407_2120719","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"de Decr. 17, 24.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"54","code":"P5408_2121035","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"John x. 30.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":10,"verses":[30]}]},{"fn":"54","code":"P5409_2121485","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"de Decr. 1, note.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter VI.

This is of itself a sufficient refutation of the Arian heresy; however, its heterodoxy will appear also from the following:-If God be Maker and Creator, and create His works through the Son, and we cannot regard things which come to be, except as being through the Word, is it not blasphemous, God being Maker, to say, that His Framing Word and His Wisdom once was not? it is the same as saying, that God is not Maker, if He had not His proper Framing Word which is from Him, but that that by which He frames, accrues to Him from without[fn-54-P5414_2122721:116-nf] , and is alien from Him, and unlike in essence. Next, let them tell us this,-or rather learn from it how irreligious they are in saying, `Once He was not,' and, `He was not before His generation;'-for if the Word is not with the Father from everlasting, the Triad is not everlasting; but a Monad was first, and afterwards by addition it became a Triad; and so as time went on, it seems what we know concerning God grew and took shape[fn-54-P5415_2123183:117-nf] . And further, if the Son is not proper offspring of the Father's essence, but of nothing has come to be, then of nothing the Triad consists, and once there was not a Triad, but a Monad; and a Triad once with deficiency, and then complete; deficient, before the Son was originated, complete when He had come to be; and henceforth a thing originated is reckoned with the Creator, and what once was not has divine worship and glory with Him who was ever[fn-54-P5416_2123662:118-nf] . Nay, what is more serious still, the Triad is discovered to he unlike Itself, consisting of strange and alien natures and essences. And this, in other words, is saying, that the Triad has an originated consistence. What sort of a religion then is this, which is not even like itself, but is in process of completion as time goes on, and is now not thus, and then again thus? For probably it will receive some fresh accession, and so on without limit, since at first and at starting it took its consistence by way of accessions.

But this is not so: perish the thought; the Triad is not originated; but there is an eternal and one Godhead in a Triad, and there is one Glory of the Holy Triad.

The Triad is Creator and Framer, and you fear not to degrade It to things which are from nothing; you scruple not to equal servile beings to the nobility of the Triad, and to rank the King, the Lord of Sabaoth with subjects[fn-54-P5418_2124941:119-nf] .

I say, it must have been eternally so; but if not eternally, not so at present either, but at present so, as you suppose it was from the beginning,-I mean, not a Triad now. But such heretics no Christian would bear; it belongs to Greeks, to introduce an originated Triad, and to level It with things originate; for these do admit of deficiencies and additions; but the faith of Christians acknowledges the blessed Triad as unalterable and perfect and ever what It was, neither adding to It what is more, nor imputing to It any loss (for both ideas are irreligious), and therefore it dissociates It from all things generated, and it guards as indivisible and worships the unity of the Godhead Itself; and shuns the Arian blasphemies, and confesses and acknowledges that the Son was ever; for He is eternal, as is the Father, of whom He is the Eternal Word,-to which subject let us now return again.","index":"52","references":[{"fn":"54","code":"P5418_2124941","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"De Decr. §31.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"19.

But if God be not as man, as He is not, we must not impute to Him the attributes of man. For brutes and men, after a Creator has begun them, are begotten by succession; and the son, having been begotten of a father who was a son, becomes accordingly in his turn a father to a son, in inheriting from his father that by which he himself has come to be. Hence in such instances there is not, properly speaking, either father or son, nor do the father and the son stay in their respective characters, for the son himself becomes a father, being son of his father, but father of his son. But it is not so in the Godhead; for not as man is God; for the Father is not from a father; therefore doth He not beget one who shall become a father; nor is the Son from effluence of the Father, nor is He begotten from a father that was begotten; therefore neither is He begotten so as to beget.

For first of all, as to their first question, which is such as this, how dull and vague it is! they do not explain who it is they ask about, so as to allow of an answer, but they say abstractedly, `He who is,' `him who is not.' Who then `is,' and what `are not,' O Arians? or who `is,' and who `is not?' what are said `to be,' what `not to be?' for He that is, can make things which are not, and which are, and which were before. For instance, carpenter, and goldsmith, and potter, each, according to his own art, works upon materials previously existing, making what vessels he pleases; and the God of all Himself, having taken the dust of the earth existing and already brought to be, fashions man; that very earth, however, whereas it was not once, He has at one time made by His own Word.

Unseemly is such an enquiry, both unseemly and very blasphemous, yet parallel with theirs; for the answer they make abounds in irreligion. But if it be blasphemous and utterly irreligious thus to inquire about God, it will be blasphemous too to make the like inquiries about His Word. However, by way of exposing a question so senseless and so dull, it is necessary to answer thus:-whereas God is, He was eternally; since then the Father is ever, His Radiance ever is, which is His Word. And again, God who is, hath from Himself His Word who also is; and neither hath the Word been added, whereas He was not before, nor was the Father once without Reason.

Nay, let them over and above take this answer to their question;-The Father who was, made the Son who was, for `the Word was made flesh[fn-54-P5471_2153799:161-nf] ;' and, whereas He was Son of God, He made Him in consummation of the ages also Son of Man, unless forsooth, after the Samosatene, they affirm that He did not even exist at all, till He became man.","index":"62","references":[{"fn":"54","code":"P5468_2151174","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Vid.

Those who ask of parents, and say, `Had you a son before you begot him?' should add, `And if you had a son, did you purchase him from without as a house or any other possession?' And then you would be answered, `He is not from without, but from myself.

For so it is; though the parent be distinct in time, as being man, who himself has come to be in time, yet he too would have had his child ever coexistent with him, but that his nature was a restraint and made it impossible. For Levi too was already in the loins of his great-grandfather, before his own actual generation, or that of his grandfather.

As we said above, so now we repeat, that the divine generation must not be compared to the nature of men, nor the Son considered to be part of God, nor the generation to imply any passion whatever; God is not as man; for men beget passibly, having a transitive nature, which waits for periods by reason of its weakness. But with God this cannot be; for He is not composed of parts, but being impassible and simple, He is impassibly and indivisibly Father of the Son. This again is strongly evidenced and proved by divine Scripture. For the Word of God is His Son, and the Son is the Father's Word and Wisdom; and Word and Wisdom is neither creature nor part of Him whose Word He is, nor an offspring passibly begotten. Uniting then the two titles, Scripture speaks of `Son,' in order to herald the natural and true offspring of His essence; and, on the other hand, that none may think of the Offspring humanly, while signifying His essence, it also calls Him Word, Wisdom, and Radiance; to teach us that the generation was impassible, and eternal, and worthy of God.[fn-54-P5484_2162798:167-nf] What affection then, or what part of the Father is the Word and the Wisdom and the Radiance? So much may be impressed even on these men of folly; for as they asked women concerning God's Son, so[fn-54-P5485_2163482:168-nf] let them inquire of men concerning the Word, and they will find that the word which they put forth is neither an affection of them nor a part of their mind. But if such be the word of men, who are passible and partitive, why speculate they about passions and parts in the instance of the immaterial and indivisible God, that under pretence of reverence[fn-54-P5486_2163857:169-nf] they may deny the true and natural generation of the Son? Enough was said above to shew that the offspring from God is not an affection; and now it has been shewn in particular that the Word is not begotten according to affection. The same may be said of Wisdom; God is not as man; nor must they here think humanly of Him. For, whereas men are capable of wisdom, God partakes in nothing, but is Himself the Father of His own Wisdom, of which whoso partake a given the name of wise. And this Wisdom too is not a passion, nor a part, but an Offspring proper to the Father. Wherefore He is ever Father, nor is the character of Father adventitious to God, lest He seem alterable; for if it is good that He be Father, but has not ever been Father, then good has not ever been in Him.29. But, observe, say they, God was always a Maker, nor is the power of framing adventitious to Him; does it follow then, that,because He is the Framer of all, therefore His works also are eternal, and is it wicked to say of them too, that they were not before origination? Senseless are these Arians; for what likeness is there between Son and work, that they should parallel a father's with a maker's function? How is it that, with that difference between offspring and work, which has been shewn, they remain so ill-instructed? Let it be repeated then, that a work is external to the nature, but a son is the proper offspring of the essence; it follows that a work need not have been always, for the workman frames it when he will; but an offspring is not subject to will, but is proper to the essence[fn-54-P5487_2167059:170-nf] . And a man may be and may be called Maker, though the works are not as yet; but father he cannot be called, nor can he be, unless a son exist. And if they curiously inquire why God, though always with the power to make, does not always make (though this also be the presumption of madmen, for `who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been His Counsellor?' or how `shall the thing formed say to' the potter, `why didst thou make me thus[fn-54-P5488_2167537:171-nf] ?' however, not to leave even a weak argument unnoticed), they must be told, that although God always had the power to make, yet the things originated had not the power of being eternal[fn-54-P5489_2167760:172-nf] . For they are out of nothing, and therefore were not before their origination; but things which were not before their origination, how could these coexist with the ever-existing God? Wherefore God, looking to what was good for them, then made them all when He saw that, when originated, they were able to abide. And as, though He was able, even from the beginning in the time of Adam, or Noah, or Moses, to send His own Word, yet He sent Him not until the consummation of the ages (for this He saw to be good for the whole creation), so also things originated did He make when He would, and as was good for them. But the Son, not being a work, but proper to the Father's offspring, always is; for, whereas the Father always is, so what is proper to His essence must always be; and this is His Word and His Wisdom. And that creatures should not be in existence, does not disparage the Maker; for He hath the power of framing them, when He wills; but For the offspring not to be ever with the Father, is a disparagement of the perfection of His essence. Wherefore His works were framed, when He would, through His Word; but the Son is ever the proper offspring of the Father's essence.","index":"68","references":[{"fn":"54","code":"P5484_2162798","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"This is a view familiar to the Fathers, viz. that in this consists our Lord's Sonship, that He is the Word, or as S Augustine says, Christum ideo Filium quia Verbum.

Not for the Father's honour ask they this, but for the dishonour of the Word. Accordingly, should any one, not aware of their craft, answer, `the Unoriginated is one,' forthwith they spirit out their own venom, saying, `Therefore the Son is among things originated,' and well have we said, `He was not before His generation.' Thus they make any kind of disturbance and confusion, provided they can but separate the Son from the Father, and reckon the Framer of all among His works. Now first they may be convicted on this score, that, while blaming the Nicene Bishops for their use of phrases not in Scripture, though these not injurious, but subversive of their irreligion, they themselves went off upon the same fault, that is, using words not in Scripture[fn-54-P5495_2172885:174-nf] , and those in contumely of the Lord, knowing `neither what they say nor whereof they affirm[fn-54-P5496_2172998:175-nf] .'

But if they ask according as Asterius ruled it, as if `what is not a work but was always' were unoriginate, then they must constantly be told that the Son as well as the Father must in this sense be called unoriginate. For He is neither in the number of things originated, nor a work, but has ever been with the Father, as has already been shewn, in spite of their many variations for the sole sake of speaking against the Lord, `He is of nothing' and `He was not before His generation.' When then, after failing at every turn, they betake themselves to the other sense of the question, `existing but not generated of any nor having a father,' we shall tell them that the unoriginate in this sense is only one, namely the Father; and they will gain nothing by their question[fn-55-P5500_2176076:178-nf] . For to say that God is in this sense Unoriginate, does not shew that the Son is a thing originated, it being evident from the above proofs that the Word is such as He is who begat Him.

(one must not weary of using repetition;) for if they will have it that the one is like the other, so that he who sees the one beholds the other, they are like to say that the Unoriginate is the image of creatures; the end of which is a confusion of the whole subject, an equalling of things originated with the Unoriginate, and a denial of the Unoriginate by measuring Him with the works; and all to reduce the Son into their number.","index":"72","references":[{"fn":"55","code":"P5500_2176076","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"but see notes on de Decr. 28","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"55","code":"P5501_2176568","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"§20, note 5.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"32. However, I suppose even they will be unwilling to proceed to such lengths, if they follow Asterius the sophist. For he, earnest as he is in his advocacy of the Arian heresy, and maintaining that the Unoriginate is one, runs counter to them in saying, that the Wisdom of God is unoriginate and without beginning also. The following is a passage out of his work[fn-55-P5503_2177479:180-nf] : `The Blessed Paul said not that he preached Christ the power of God or the wisdom of God, but, without the article, `God's power and God's wisdom[fn-55-P5504_2177661:181-nf] ;' thus preaching that the proper power of God Himself, which is natural to Him and co-existent with Him unoriginatedly, is something besides.' And again, soon after: `However, His eternal power and wisdom, which truth argues to be without beginning and unoriginate; this must surely be one.' For though, misunderstanding the Apostle's words, he considered that there were two wisdoms; yet, by speaking still of a wisdom coexistent with Him, he declares that the Unoriginate is not simply one, but that there is another Unoriginate with Him. For what is coexistent, coexists not with itself, but with another. If then they agree with Asterius, let them never ask again, `Is the Unoriginate one or two,' or they will have to contest the point with him; if, on the other hand, they differ even from him, let them not rely upon his treatise, lest, `biting one another, they be consumed one of another[fn-55-P5505_2178580:182-nf] .' So much on the point of their ignorance; but who can say enough on their crafty character? who but would justly hate them while possessed by such a madness? for when they were no longer allowed to say `out of nothing' and `He was not before His generation,' they hit upon this word `unoriginate,' that, by saying among the simple that the Son was `originate,' they might imply the very same phrases `out of nothing,' and `He once was not;' for in such phrases things originated and creatures are implied.","index":"73","references":[{"fn":"55","code":"P5503_2177479","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"De Syn. §18, infr. ii. 37.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"55","code":"P5504_2177661","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"1 Cor. i. 24.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":1,"verses":[24]}]},{"fn":"55","code":"P5505_2178580","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Gal. v. 15.","bible_refs":[{"book":"galatians","chapter":5,"verses":[15]}]}]},{"text":"33. If they have confidence in their own positions, they should stand to them, and not change about so variously[fn-55-P5507_2179219:183-nf] ; but this they will not, from an idea that success is easy, if they do but shelter their heresy under colour of the word `unoriginate.' Yet after all, this term is not used in contrast with the Son, clamour as they may, but with things originated; and the like may be found in the words `Almighty,' and `Lord of the Powers[fn-55-P5508_2179569:184-nf] .' For if we say that the Father has power and mastery over all things by the Word, and the Son rules the Father's kingdom, and has the power of all, as His Word, and as the Image of the Father, it is quite plain that neither here is the Son reckoned among that all, nor is God called Almighty and Lord with reference to Him, but to those things which through the Son come to be, and over which He exercises power and mastery through the Word. And therefore the Unoriginate is specified not by contrast to the Son, but to the things which through the Son come to be. And excellently: since God is not as things originated, but is their Creator and Framer through the Son. And as the word `Unoriginate' is specified relatively to things originated, so the word `Father' is indicative of the Son. And he who names God Maker and Framer and Unoriginate, regards and apprehends things created and made; and he who calls God Father, thereby conceives and contemplates the Son. And hence one might marvel at the obstinacy which is added to their irreligion, that, whereas the term `unoriginate' has the aforesaid good sense, and admits of being used religiously[fn-55-P5509_2181331:185-nf] , they, in their own heresy, bring it forth for the dishonour of the Son, not having read that he who honoureth the Son honoureth the Father, and he who dishonoureth the Son, dishonoureth the Father[fn-55-P5510_2181551:186-nf] .

For, in calling God unoriginate, they are, as I said before, calling Him from His works, and as Maker only and Framer, supposing that hence they may signify that the Word is a work after their own pleasure. But that he who calls God Father, signifies Him from the Son being well aware that if there be a Son, of necessity through that Son all things originate were created. And they, when they call Him Unoriginate, name Him only from His works, and know not the Son any more than the Greeks; but he who calls God Father, names Him from the Word; and knowing the Word he acknowledges Him to be Framer of all, and understands that through Him all things have been made.","index":"74","references":[{"fn":"55","code":"P5507_2179219","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"De Syn. 9, note 2.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"55","code":"P5508_2179569","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"The passage which follows is written with his de Decr. before him.

For the latter title, as I have said, does nettling more than signify all the works, individually and collectively, which have come to be at the will of God through the Word; but the title Father has its significance and its bearing only from the Son. And, whereas the Word surpasses things originated, by so much and more doth calling God Father surpass the calling Him Un-originate. For the latter is unscriptural and suspicious, because it has various senses; so that, when a man is asked concerning it, his mind is carried about to many ideas; but the word Father is simple and scriptural, and more accurate, and only implies the Son. And `Unoriginate' is a word of the Greeks, who know not the Son; but `Father' has been acknowledged and vouchsafed by our Lord. For He, knowing Himself whose Son He was, said, `I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me;' and, `He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father,' and `I and the Father are One[fn-55-P5514_2183925:189-nf] ;' but nowhere is He found to call the Father Unoriginate.

How they trifle, appears from the following questions:-`Has He free will, or has He not? is He good from choice according to free will, and can He, if He will, alter, being of an alterable nature? or, as wood or stone, has He not His choice free to be moved and, incline hither and thither?' It is but agreeable to their heresy thus to speak and think; for, when once they have framed to themselves a God out of nothing and a created Son, of course they also adopt such terms, as being suitable to a creature. However, when in their controversies with Churchmen they hear from them of the real and only Word of the Father, and yet venture thus to speak of Him, does not their doctrine then become the most loathsome that can be found? is it not enough to distract a man on mere hearing, though unable to reply, and to make him stop his ears, from astonishment at the novelty of what he hears them say, which even to mention is to blaspheme?

They say then, that the Apostle writes, `Wherefore God also hath highly exalted Him, and given Him a Name which is above every name; that in the Name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth[fn-55-P5538_2192769:204-nf] ;' and David, `Wherefore God even Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows[fn-55-P5539_2192908:205-nf] .'

For what is from another by nature, is a real offspring, as Isaac was to Abraham, and Joseph to Jacob, and the radiance to the sun; but the so called sons from virtue and grace, have but in place of nature a grace by acquisition, and are something else besides[fn-55-P5541_2193939:207-nf] the gift itself; as the men who have received the Spirit by participation, concerning whom Scripture saith, `I begat and exalted children, and they rebelled against Me[fn-55-P5542_2194123:208-nf] .'

But if they say this of the Saviour also, it follows that He is neither very God nor very Son, nor like the Father, nor in any wise has God for a Father of His being according to essence, but of the mere grace given to Him, and for a Creator of His being according to essence, after the similitude of all others. And being such, as they maintain, it will be manifest further that He had not the name `Son' from the first, if so be it was the prize of works done and of that very same advance which He made when He became man, and took the form of the servant; but then, when, after becoming `obedient unto death,' He was, as the text says, `highly exalted,' and received that `Name' as a grace, `that in the Name of Jesus every knee should bow[fn-55-P5544_2195173:209-nf] .'

What then was before this? One must urge the question on them again, to make it understood what their irreligious doctrine results in[fn-55-P5545_2195665:210-nf] . For if the Lord be God, Son, Word, yet was not all these before He became man, either He was something else beside these, and afterwards became partaker of them for His virtue's sake, as we have said; or they must adopt the alternative (may it return upon their heads!) that He was not before that time, but is wholly man by nature and nothing more. But this is no sentiment of the Church. but of the Samosatene and of the present Jews. Why then, if they think as Jews, are they not circumcised with them too, instead of pretending Christianity, while they are its foes? For if He was not, or was indeed, but afterwards was promoted, how were all things made by Him, or how in Him, were He not perfect, did the Father delight[fn-55-P5546_2197290:211-nf] ? And He, on the other hand, if now promoted, how did He before rejoice in the presence of the Father? And, if He received His worship after dying, how is Abraham seen to worship Him in the tent[fn-55-P5547_2197508:212-nf] , and Moses in the bush? and, as Daniel saw, myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands were ministering unto Him? And if, as they say, He had His promotion now, bow did the Son Himself make mention of that His glory before and above the world, when He said, `Glorify Thou Me, O Father, with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was[fn-55-P5548_2197881:213-nf] .' If, as they say, He was then exalted, bow did He before that `bow the heavens and come down;' and again, `The Highest gave His thunder[fn-55-P5549_2198040:214-nf] ?' Therefore, if, even before the world was made, the Son had that glory, and was Lord of glory and the Highest, and descended from heaven, and is ever to be worshipped, it follows that He had not promotion from His descent, but rather Himself promoted the things which needed promotion; and if He descended to effect their promotion, therefore He did not receive in reward the name of the Son and God, but rather He Himself has made us sons of the Father, and deifed men by becoming Himself man.","index":"83","references":[{"fn":"55","code":"P5544_2195173","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Phil. ii. 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"philippians","chapter":2,"verses":[8]}]},{"fn":"55","code":"P5545_2195665","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"The Arians perhaps more than other heretics were remarkable for bringing objections against the received view, rather than forming a consistent theory of their own Indeed the very vigour and success of their assault upon the truth lay in its being a mere assault, not a positive and substantive teaching.

Hitherto we have met their irrational conceits with the true conceptions[fn-55-P5559_2201135:222-nf] implied in the Word `Son,' as the Lord Himself has given us. But it will be well next to cite the divine oracles, that the unalterableness of the Son and His unchangeable nature, which is the Father's, as well as their perverseness, may be still more fully proved. The Apostle then, writing to the Philippians, says, `Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus; who, being in the form of God, thought it not a prize to be equal with God; but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men. And, being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself. becoming obedient to death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also highly exalted Him, and gave Him a Name which is above every name; that in the Name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father[fn-55-P5560_2202222:223-nf] .' Can anything be plainer and more express than this? He was not from a lower state pro-rooted: but rather, existing as God, He took the form of a servant, and in taking it, was not promoted but humbled Himself. Where then is there here any reward of virtue, or what advancement and promotion in humiliation? For if, being God, He became man, and descending from on high He is still said to be exalted, where is He exalted, being God? this withal being plain, that, since God is highest of all, His Word must necessarily he highest also. Where then could He be exalted higher, who is in the Father and like the Father in all things[fn-55-P5561_2202877:224-nf] ? Therefore He is beyond the need of any addition; nor is such as the Arians think Him. For though the Word has descended in order to be exalted, and so it is written, yet what need was there that He should humble Himself, as if to seek that which He had already? And what grace did He receive who is the Giver of grace[fn-55-P5562_2203243:225-nf] ? or how did He receive that Name for worship, who is always worshipped by His Name? Nay, certainly before He became man, the sacred writers invoke Him, `Save me, O God, for Thy Name's sake[fn-55-P5563_2203456:226-nf] ;'and again, `Some put their trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we will remember the Name of the Lord our God[fn-55-P5564_2203593:227-nf] .'

Accordingly this is not said before the Word became flesh; that it might be plain that `humbled' and `exalted' are spoken of His human nature; for where there is humble estate, there too may be exaltation; and if because of His taking flesh `humbled' is written, it is clear that `highly exalted' is also said because of it. For of this was man's nature in want, because of the humble estate of the flesh and of death. Since then the Word, being the Image of the Father and immortal, took the form of the servant, and as man underwent for us death in His flesh, that thereby He might offer Himself for us through death to the Father; therefore also, as man, He is said because of us and for us to be highly exalted, that as by His death we all died in Christ, so again in the Christ Himself we might be highly exalted, being raised from the dead, and ascending into heaven, `whither the forerunner Jesus is for us entered, not into the figures of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us[fn-55-P5571_2206198:233-nf] .' But if now for us the Christ is entered into heaven itself, though He was even before and always Lord and Framer of the heavens, for us therefore is that present exaltation written. And as He Himself, who sanctifies all, says also that He sanctifies Himself to the Father for our sakes, not that the Word may become holy, but that He Himself may in Himself sanctify all of us, in like manner we must take the present phrase, `He highly exalted Him,' not that He Himself should be exalted, for He is the highest, but that He may become righteousness for us[fn-55-P5572_2206790:234-nf] , and we may be exalted in Him, and that we may enter the gates of heaven, which He has also opened for us, the forerunners saying, `Lift up your gates, O ye rulers, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of Glory shall come in[fn-55-P5573_2207573:235-nf] .' For here also not on Him were shut the gates, as being Lord and Maker of all, but because of us is this too written, to whom the door of paradise was shut. And therefore in a human relation, because of the flesh which He bore, it is said of Him, `Lift up your gates,' and `shall come in,' as if a man were entering; but in a divine relation on the other hand it is said of Him, since `the Word was God,' that He is the `Lord' and the `King of Glory.'

For it is the Father's glory that man, made and then lost, should be found again; and, when dead, that he should be made alive, and should become God's temple. For whereas the powers in heaven, both Angels and Archangels, were ever worshipping the Lord, as they are now worshipping Him in the Name of Jesus, this is our grace and high exaltation, that even when He became man, the Son of God is worshipped, and the heavenly powers will not be astonished at seeing all of us, who are of one body with Him[fn-55-P5577_2209975:238-nf] , introduced into their realms. And this had not been, unless He who existed in the form of God had taken on Him a servant's form, and had humbled Himself, yielding His body to come unto death.","index":"87","references":[{"fn":"55","code":"P5577_2209975","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Infr. §43.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"43. Behold then what men considered the foolishness of God because of the Cross, has become of all things most honoured.

And the illusion of demons is come to nought, and He only who is really God is worshipped in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ[fn-55-P5579_2210639:239-nf] . For the fact that the Lord, even when come in human body and called Jesus, was worshipped and believed to be God's Son, and that through Him the Father was known, shows, as has been said, that not the Word, considered as the Word, received this so great grace, but we. For because of our relationship to His Body we too have become God's temple, and in consequence are made God's sons, so that even in us the Lord is now worshipped, and beholders report, as the Apostle says, that God is in them of a truth[fn-55-P5580_2211180:240-nf] . As also John says in the Gospel, `As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become children of God[fn-55-P5581_2211989:241-nf] ;' and in his Epistle he writes, `By this we know that He abideth in us by His Spirit which He hath given us[fn-55-P5582_2212117:242-nf] .' And this too is an evidence of His goodness towards us that, while we were exalted because that the Highest Lord is in us, and on our account grace was given to Him, because that the Lord who supplies the grace has become a man like us, He on the other hand, the Saviour, humbled Himself in taking `our body of humiliation[fn-55-P5583_2212466:243-nf] ,' and took a servant's form, putting on that flesh which was enslaved to sin[fn-55-P5584_2212568:244-nf] . And He indeed has gained nothing from us for His own promotion: for the Word of God is without want and full; but rather we were promoted from Him; for He is the `Light, which lighteneth every man, coming into the world[fn-55-P5585_2216069:245-nf] .' And in vain do the Arians lay stress upon the conjunction `wherefore,' because Paul has said, `Wherefore, hath God highly exalted Him.' For in saying this he did not imply any prize of virtue, nor promotion from advance[fn-55-P5586_2216310:246-nf] , but the cause why the exaltation was bestowed upon us. And what is this but that He who existed in form of God, the Son of a noble[fn-55-P5587_2216491:247-nf] Father, humbled Himself and became a servant instead of us and in our behalf? For if the Lord had not become man, we had not been redeemed from sins, not raised from the dead, but remaining dead under the earth; not exalted into heaven, but lying in Hades. Because of us then and in our behalf are the words, `highly exalted' and `given.'","index":"88","references":[{"fn":"55","code":"P5579_2210639","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"De Incar. §46, 51, &c.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"55","code":"P5580_2211180","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"ontwj en umin o qeoj. 1 Cor. xiv. 25.

This then I consider the sense of this passage, and that, a very ecclesiastical sense[fn-55-P5589_2216936:248-nf] . However, there is another way in which one might remark upon it, giving the same sense in a parallel way; viz. that, though it does not speak of the exaltation of the Word Himself, so far as He is Word[fn-55-P5590_2217207:249-nf] (for He is, as was just now said, most high and like His Father), yet by reason of His becoming man it indicates His resurrection from the dead. For after saying, `He hath humbled Himself even unto death,' He immediately added, `Wherefore He hath highly exalted Him;' wishing to shew, that, although as man He is said to have died, yet, as being Life, He was exalted on the resurrection; for `He who descended, is the same also who rose again[fn-55-P5591_2217671:250-nf] .' He descended in body, and He rose again because He was God Himself in the body. And this again is the reason why according to this meaning he brought in the conjunction `Wherefore;' not as a reward of virtue nor of advancement, but to signify the cause why the resurrection took place; and why, while all other men from Adam down to this time have died and remained dead, He only rose in integrity from the dead. The cause is this, which He Himself has already taught us, that, being God, He has become man. For all other men, being merely born of Adam, died, and death reigned over them; but He, the Second Man, is from heaven, for `the Word was made flesh[fn-55-P5592_2218376:251-nf] ,' and this Man is said to be from heaven and heavenly[fn-55-P5593_2218450:252-nf] , because the Word descended from heaven; wherefore He was not held under death. For though He humbled Himself, yielding His own Body to come unto death, in that it was capable of death[fn-55-P5594_2218659:253-nf] , yet He was highly exalted from earth, because He was God's Son in a body. Accordingly what is here said, `Wherefore God also hath highly exalted Him,' answers to Peter's words in the Acts, `Whom God raised up, having loosed the bonds of death, because it was not possible that He should be holden of it[fn-55-P5595_2220186:254-nf] .' For as Paul has written, `Since being in form of God He became man, and humbled Himself unto death, therefore God also hath highly exalted Him,' so also Peter says, `Since, being God, He became man, and signs and wonders proved Him to beholders to be God, therefore it was not possible that He should be holden of death.' To alan it was not possible to succeed in this; for death belongs to man; wherefore, the Word, being God, became flesh, that, being put to death in the flesh, He might quicken all men by His own power.","index":"89","references":[{"fn":"55","code":"P5589_2216936","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"ekklhsiastikoj, vid.

But since He Himself is said to be `exalted,' and God `gave' Him, and the heretics think this a defect[fn-55-P5597_2220839:255-nf] or affection in the essence[fn-55-P5598_2220898:256-nf] of the Word, it becomes necessary to explain how these words are used. He is said to he exalted from the lower parts of the earth, because death is ascribed even to Him. Both events are reckoned His, since it was His Body[fn-55-P5599_2221951:257-nf] , and none other's, that was exalted from the dead and taken up into heaven. And again, the Body being His, and the Word not being external to it, it is natural that when the Body was exalted, He, as man, should, because of the body, be spoken of as exalted. If then He did not become man, let this not be said of Him: but if the Word became flesh, of necessity the resurrection and exaltation, as in the case of a man, must be ascribed to Him, that the death which is ascribed to Him may be a redemption of the sin of men and an abolition of death, and that the resurrection and exaltation may for His sake remain secure for us. In both respects he hath said of Him, `God hath highly exalted Him,' and `God hath given to Him;' that herein moreover he may show that it is not the Father that hath become flesh, but it is His Word, who has become man, and receives after the manner of men from the Father, and is exalted by Him, as has been said. And it is plain, nor would any one dispute it, that what the Father gives, He gives through. the Son. And it is marvellous and overwhelming verily; for the grace which the Son gives from the Father, that the Son Himself is said to receive; and the exaltation, which the Son bestows from the Father, with that the Son is Himself exalted. For He who is the Son of God, became Himself the Son of Man; and, as Word, He gives from the Father, for all things which the Father does and gives, He does and supplies through Him; and as the Son of Man, He Himself is said after the manner of men to receive what proceeds from Him, because His Body is none other than His, and is a natural recipient of grace, as has been said. For He received it as far as His man's nature[fn-56-P5600_2224376:258-nf] was exalted; which exaltation was its being deified.

Behold, O ye Arians, and acknowledge even hence the truth. The Singer speaks of us all as `fellows' or `partakers' of the Lord: but were He one of things which come out of nothing and of things originate, He Himself had been one of those who partake. But, since he hymned Him as the eternal God, saying, `Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever,' and has declared that all other things partake of Him, what conclusion must we draw, but that He is distinct from originated things, and He only the Father's veritable Word, Radiance, and Wisdom, which all things originate partake[fn-56-P5607_2226250:261-nf] , being sanctified by Him in the Spirit[fn-56-P5608_2226313:262-nf] ? And therefore He is here `anointed,' not that He may become God, for He was so even before; nor that He may become King, for He had the Kingdom eternally, existing as God's Image, as the sacred Oracle shews; but in our behalf is this written, as before. For the Israelitish kings, upon their being anointed, then became kings, not being so before, as David, as Hezekiah, as Josiah, and the rest; but the Saviour on the contrary, being God, and ever ruling in the Father's Kingdom, and being Himself He that supplies the Holy Ghost, nevertheless is here said to be anointed, that, as before, being said as man to be anointed with the Spirit, He might provide for us men, not only exaltation and resurrection, but the indwelling and intimacy of the Spirit. And signifying this the Lord Himself hath said by His own mouth in the Gospel according to John, `I have sent them into the world, and for their sakes do I sanctify Myself, that they may be sanctified in the truth[fn-56-P5609_2227860:263-nf] .' In saying this He has shown that He is not the sanctified, but the Sanctifier; for He is not sanctified by other, but Himself sanctifies Himself, that we may be sanctified in the truth. He who sanctifies Himself is Lord of sanctification. How then does this take place? What does He mean but this? `I, being the Father's Word, I give to Myself, when becoming man, the Spirit; and Myself, become man, do I sanctify in Him, that henceforth in Me, who am Truth (for \"Thy Word is Truth\"), all may be sanctified.'","index":"93","references":[{"fn":"56","code":"P5606_2225638","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Ps. xlv. 7, Ps. xlv. 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":45,"verses":[7]},{"book":"psalms","chapter":45,"verses":[8]}]},{"fn":"56","code":"P5607_2226250","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"p. 156, note 4.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"56","code":"P5608_2226313","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"It is here said that all things `originate' partake the Son and are `sanctified' by the Spirit.

If then for our sake He sanctifies Himself, and does this when He is become man, it is very plain that the Spirit's descent on Him in Jordan was a descent upon us, because of His bearing our body.

And when He received the Spirit, we it was who by Him were made recipients of It. And moreover for this reason, not as Aaron or David or the rest, was He anointed with oil, but in another way above all His fellows, `with the oil of gladness,' which He Himself interprets to be the Spirit, saying by the Prophet, `The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because the Lord hath anointed Me[fn-56-P5613_2229411:266-nf] ;' as also the Apostle has said, `How God anointed Him with the Holy Ghosts.[fn-56-P5614_2229509:267-nf] ' When then were these things spoken of Him but when He came in the flesh and was baptized in Jordan, and the Spirit descended on Him? And indeed the Lord Himself said, `The Spirit shall take of Mine;' and `I will send Him;' and to His disciples, `Receive ye the Holy Ghost[fn-56-P5615_2229802:268-nf] .' And notwithstanding, He who, as the Word and Radiance of the Father, gives to others, now is said to be sanctified, because now He has become man, and the Body that is sanctified is His. From Him then we have begun to receive the unction and the seal, John saying, `And ye have an unction from the Holy One;' and the Apostle, `And ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise[fn-56-P5616_2230230:269-nf] .' Therefore because of us and for us are these words. What advance then of promotion, and reward of virtue or generally of conduct, is proved from this in our Lord's instance? For if He was not God, and then had become God, if not being King He was preferred to the Kingdom, your reasoning would have had some faint plausibility. But if He is God and the throne of His kingdom is everlasting, in what way could God advance? or what was there wanting to Him who was sitting on His Father's throne? And if, as the Lord Himself has said, the Spirit is His, and takes of His, and He sends It, it is not the Word, considered as the Word and Wisdom, who is anointed with the Spirit which He Himself gives, but the flesh assumed by Him which is anointed in Him and by Him[fn-56-P5617_2231030:270-nf] ; that the sanctification coming to the Lord as man, may come to all men from Him. For not of Itself, saith He, doth the Spirit speak, but the Word is He who gives It to the worthy. For this is like the passage considered above; for as the Apostle has written, `Who existing in form of God thought it not a prize to be equal with God, but emptied Himself, and took a servant's form,' so David celebrates the Lord, as the everlasting God and King, but sent to us and assuming our booty which is mortal. For this its his meaning in the Psalm, `All thy garments[fn-56-P5618_2232468:271-nf] smell of myrrh, aloes. and cassia;' and it is represented by Nicodemus and by Mary's company, when the one came bringing `a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pounds weight;' and the others[fn-56-P5619_2232967:272-nf] `the spices which they had prepared' for the burial of the Lord's body.","index":"94","references":[{"fn":"56","code":"P5611_2228861","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"1 Cor. iii. 16.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":3,"verses":[16]}]},{"fn":"56","code":"P5612_2228980","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Pusey on Baptism, 2nd Ed. pp. 275-293.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"56","code":"P5613_2229411","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Isai. lxi. 1.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"56","code":"P5614_2229509","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Acts x. 38.","bible_refs":[{"book":"the acts","chapter":10,"verses":[38]}]},{"fn":"56","code":"P5615_2229802","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"John xvi. 14, John xvi. 7; John xx. 22.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":16,"verses":[14]},{"book":"john","chapter":16,"verses":[7]},{"book":"john","chapter":20,"verses":[22]},{"book":"john","chapter":16,"verses":[14]},{"book":"john","chapter":16,"verses":[7]},{"book":"john","chapter":20,"verses":[22]}]},{"fn":"56","code":"P5616_2230230","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"1 John ii. 20; Eph. i. 13.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 john","chapter":2,"verses":[20]},{"book":"ephesians","chapter":1,"verses":[13]},{"book":"1 john","chapter":2,"verses":[20]},{"book":"ephesians","chapter":1,"verses":[13]}]},{"fn":"56","code":"P5617_2231030","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"the Godhead","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"56","code":"P5618_2232468","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Ps. xlv. 8.

See ye not, that this too was done and written because of us and for us, that us who are mortal and temporal, the Lord, become man, might make immortal, and bring into the everlasting kingdom of heaven? Blush ye not, speaking lies against the divine oracles? For when our Lord Jesus Christ had been among us, we indeed were promoted, as rescued from sin; but He is the same[fn-56-P5621_2233681:273-nf] ; nor did He alter, when He became man (to repeat what I have said), but, as has been written, `The Word of God abideth for ever[fn-56-P5622_2233833:274-nf] .' Surely as, before His becoming man, He, the Word, dispensed to the saints the Spirit as His own[fn-56-P5623_2233973:275-nf] , so also when made man, He sanctifies all by the Spirit and says to His Disciples, `Receive ye the Holy Ghost.' And He gave to Moses and the other seventy; and through Him David prayed to the Father, saying, `Take not Thy Holy Spirit from me[fn-56-P5624_2234236:276-nf] .' On the other hand, when made man, He said, `I will send to you the Paraclete, the Spirit of truth[fn-56-P5625_2234356:277-nf] ;' and He sent Him, He, the Word of God, as being faithful. Therefore `Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever[fn-56-P5626_2234504:278-nf] ,' remaining unalterable, and at once gives and receives, giving as God's Word, receiving as man. It is not the Word then, viewed as the Word, that is promoted; for He had all things and has them always; but men, who have in Him and through Him their origin[fn-56-P5627_2234783:279-nf] of receiving them. For, when He is now said to be anointed in a human respect, we it is who in Him are anointed; since also when He is baptized, we it is who in Him are baptized. But on all these things the Saviour throws much light, when He says to the Father, `And the glory which Thou gavest Me, I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one[fn-56-P5628_2237380:280-nf] .' Because of us then He asked for glory, and the words occur, `took' and `gave' and `highly exalted,' that we might take, and to us might be given, and we might be exalted. in Him; as also for us He sanctifies Himself, that we might be sanctified in Him[fn-56-P5629_2237657:281-nf] .","index":"95","references":[{"fn":"56","code":"P5621_2233681","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"p. 159, note 8.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"56","code":"P5622_2233833","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Isai. xl. 8. logoj but rhma.

S. Chrysostom explains, Hom. in Matt. lxxxii. 5.

For He says not, `Wherefore He anointed Thee in order to Thy being God or Kites or Son or Word;' for so He was before and is for ever, as has been shewn; but rather, `Since Thou art God and King,therefore Thou wast anointed, since none bat Thou couldest unite man to the Holy Ghost, Thou the Image of the Father, in which[fn-56-P5631_2238455:282-nf] we were made in the beginning; for Thine is even the Spirit.'

What is there to wonder at, what to disbelieve, if the Lord who gives the Spirit, is here said Himself to be anointed with the Spirit, at a time when, necessity requiring it, He did not refuse in respect of His manhood to call Himself inferior to the Spirit? For the Jews saying that He east out devils in Beelzebub, He answered and said to them, for the exposure of their blasphemy, `But if 1 through the Spirit of God cast out demons[fn-56-P5640_2241286:290-nf] .' Behold, the Giver of the Spirit here says that He cast out demons in the Spirit; but this is not said, except because of His flesh. For since man's nature is not equal of itself to casting out demons, but only in power of the Spirit, therefore as man He said, `But if I through the Spirit of God cast out demons.' Of course too He signified that the blasphemy offered to the Holy Ghost is greater than that against His humanity, when He said, `Whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him;' such as were those who said, `Is not this the carpenter's son[fn-56-P5641_2241898:291-nf] ?' but they who blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, and ascribe the deeds of the Word to the devil, shall have inevitable punishment[fn-56-P5642_2242067:292-nf] . This is what the Lord spoke to the Jews, as man; but to the disciples shewing His Godhead and His majesty, and intimating that He was not inferior but equal to the Spirit, He gave the Spirit and said, `Receive ye the Holy Ghost,' and `I send Him,' and `He shall glorify Me,' and `Whatsoever He heareth, that He shall speak[fn-56-P5643_2242433:293-nf] .' As then in this place the Lord Himself, the Giver of the Spirit, does not refuse to say that through the Spirit He casts out demons, as man; in like manner He the same, the Giver of the Spirit. refused not to say, `The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He hath anointed Me[fn-56-P5644_2242762:294-nf] ,' in respect of His having become flesh, as John hath said; that it might be shewn in both these particulars, that we are they who need the Spirit's grace in our sanctification, and again who are unable to cast oat demons without the Spirit's power. Through whom then and from whom behoved it that the Spirit should be given but through the Son, whose also the Spirit is? and when were we enabled to receive It, except when the Word became man? and,as the passage of the Apostle shews, that we had not been redeemed and highly exalted,, had not He who exists in form od God taken a servant's form, so David also shews, that no otherwise should we have partaken the Spirit and been sanctified, but that the Giver of the Spirit, the Word Himself, hast spoken of Himself as anointed with the Spirit for us. And therefore have we securely received it, He being said to i he anointed in the flesh; for the flesh being first sanctified in Him[fn-56-P5645_2243719:295-nf] , and He being said, as man, to have received for its sake, we have the sequel of the Spirit grace, receiving `out of His fulness[fn-56-P5646_2243869:296-nf] .'","index":"97","references":[{"fn":"56","code":"P5640_2241286","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Matt. xii. 28.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":12,"verses":[28]}]},{"fn":"56","code":"P5641_2241898","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Matt. xii. 32; Matt. xiii. 55.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":12,"verses":[32]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":13,"verses":[55]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":12,"verses":[32]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":13,"verses":[55]}]},{"fn":"56","code":"P5642_2242067","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Cf.

Nor do the words, `Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity,' which are added in the Psalm, show, as again you suppose, that the Nature of the Word is alterable, but rather by their very force signify His unalterableness. For since of things originate the nature is alterable, and the one portion had transgressed and the other disobeyed, as has been said, and it is not certain how they will act, but it often happens that he who is now good afterwards alters anti becomes different, so that one who was but now righteous, soon is found unrighteous, wherefore there i was here also need of one unalterable, that men might have the immutability of the righteousness of the Word as an image and type for virtue[fn-56-P5648_2244612:297-nf] .

For since the first man Adam altered, and through sin death came into the world, therefore it became the second Adam to be unalterable; that, should the Serpent again assault, even the Serpent's deceit might be baffled, and, the Lord being unalterable and unchangeable, the Serpent might become powerless in his assault against all.

Vainly then, here again, O Arians, have ye made this conjecture, and vainly alleged the words of Scripture; for God's Word is unalterable, and is ever in one state, not as it may happen[fn-56-P5655_2246546:303-nf] , but as the Father is; since how. He like the Father, unless He be thus? or how is all that is the Father's the Son's also, if He has not the unalterableness and unchangeableness of the Father[fn-56-P5656_2246814:304-nf] ? Not as being subject to laws[fn-56-P5657_2246880:305-nf] , and biassed to one side, does He love the one and hate the other, lest, if from fear of falling away He chooses the one, We admit that He is alterable otherwise also; but, as being God and the Father's Word, He is a just judge and lover of virtue, or rather its dispenser. Therefore being just and holy by nature, on this account He is sail to love righteousness and to hate iniquity; as much as to say, that He loves and chooses the virtuous, and rejects and hates the unrighteous. And divine Scripture says the same of the Father; `The Righteous Lord loveth righteousness; Thou hatest all them that work iniquity[fn-56-P5658_2247761:306-nf] ,' and `The Lord loveth the gates of Sion, more than all the dwellings of Jacob[fn-56-P5659_2247869:307-nf] ;' and, `Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated[fn-56-P5660_2247943:308-nf] ;' and in Isaiah there is tile voice of God again saying, `I the Lord love righteousness, and hate robbery of unrighteousness[fn-56-P5661_2248098:309-nf] .' Let them then expound those former words as these latter; for the former also are written of the Image of God else, misinterpreting these as those, they will conceive that the Father too is alterable. But since the very hearing others say this is not without peril, we do well to think that God is said to love righteousness and to hate robbery of unrighteousness, not as if biassed to one side, and capable of the contrary, so as to select the latter and not choose the farmer, for this belongs to things originated, but that, as a judge, He loves and takes to Him the righteous and withdraws from the bad. It follows then to think tile same concerning the Image of God also, that He loves and hates no otherwise than thus. For such must be the nature of the Image as is Its Father, though the Arians in their blindness fail to see either that image or any other truth of the divine oracles. For being forced from the conceptions or rather misconceptions[fn-56-P5662_2249075:310-nf] of their own hearts, they fall back upon passages of divine Scripture, and here too from want of understanding, according to their wont, they discern not their meaning; but laying down their own irreligion as a sort of canon of interpretation[fn-56-P5663_2249372:311-nf] , they wrest the whole of the divine oracles into accordance with it. And so on the bare mention of such doctrine, they deserve nothing but the reply, `Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God[fn-56-P5664_2249952:312-nf] ;' and if they persist in it, they must be put to silence, by the words, `Render to' man `the things that are' man's, `and to God the things that are' God's[fn-56-P5665_2250132:313-nf] .","index":"99","references":[{"fn":"56","code":"P5655_2246546","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"aplwj, ouk aplwj wrisqh, all' akribwj echtasqh.

And again, hearing from the Saviour the events of the end, they desired to learn the time of it, that they might be kept from error themselves, and might be able to teach others; as, for instance, when they had learned, they set right the Thessalonians[fn-56-P5682_2254367:325-nf] , who were going wrong.

Such has been the state of mind under which Christ's enemies have fallen into their execrable heresy. For had they known the person, and the subject, and the season of the Apostle's words, they would not have expounded of Christ's divinity what belongs to His manhood, nor in their folly have committed so great an act of irreligion. Now this will be readily seen, if one expounds properly the beginning of this lectin. For the Apostle says, `God who at sundry times and divers manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by His Son[fn-56-P5689_2256513:331-nf] ;' then again shortly after he says, `when He had by Himself purged our sins, He sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high, having become so much better than the Angels, as He hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent Name than they[fn-56-P5690_2256787:332-nf] .' It appears then that the Apostle's words make mention of that time, when God spoke unto us by His Son, and when a purging of sins took place. Now when did He speak unto us by His Son, and when did purging of sins take place? and when did He become man? when, but subsequently to the Prophets in the last days? Next, proceeding with his account of the economy in which we were concerned, and speaking of the last times, he is naturally led to observe that not even in the former times was God silent with men, but spoke to them by the Prophets. And, whereas the prophets ministered, and the Law was spoken by Angels, while the Son too came on earth, and that in order to minister, he was forced to add, `Become so much better than the Angels,' wishing to shew that, as much as the son excels a servant, so much also the ministry of the Son is better than the ministry of servants. Contrasting then the old ministry and the new, the Apostle deals freely with the Jews, writing and saying, `Become so much better than the Angels.' This is why throughout he uses no comparison, such as `become greater,' or `more honourable,' lest we test we should think of Him and them as one in kind, but `better' is his word, by way of marking the difference of the Son's nature from things originated. And of this we have proof from divine Scripture; David, for instance, saying in the Psalm. `One day in Thy courts is better than a thousand[fn-56-P5691_2258249:333-nf] :' and Solomon crying out, `Receive my instruction and not silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold. For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it[fn-56-P5692_2258480:334-nf] .' Are not wisdom and stones of the earth different in essence and separate in nature? Are heavenly courts at all akin to earthly houses? Or is there any similarity between things eternal and spiritual, and things temporal and mortal? And this is what Isaiah says, `Thus saith the Lord unto the eunuchs that keep My sabbaths, and choose the things that please Me, and take hold of My Covenant; even unto them will I give in Mine house, and within My walls, a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off[fn-56-P5693_2259097:335-nf] .' In like manner there is nought akin between the Son and the Angels; so that the word `better' is not used to compare but to contrast, because of the difference of His nature from them. And therefore the Apostle also himself, when he interprets the word `better,' places its force in nothing short of the Son's excellence over things originated, calling the one Son, the other servants; the one, as a Son with the Father, sitting on the right; and the others, as servants, standing before Him, and being sent, and fulfilling offices.","index":"104","references":[{"fn":"56","code":"P5689_2256513","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Heb. i. 1, Heb. i. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"hebrews","chapter":1,"verses":[1]},{"book":"hebrews","chapter":1,"verses":[2]}]},{"fn":"56","code":"P5690_2256787","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Ib.

Nor[fn-56-P5695_2259841:336-nf] does even the expression `become,' which here occurs, shew that the Son is originate, as ye suppose. If indeed it were simply `become' and no more, a case might stand for the Arians; but, whereas they are forestalled with the word `Son' throughout the passage, shewing that He is other than things originate, so again not even the word `become' occurs absolutely[fn-56-P5696_2261003:337-nf] , but `better' is immediately subjoined. For the writer thought the expression immaterial, knowing that in the case of one who was confessedly a genuine Son, to say `become' is the same with saying that He had been made, and is, `better.' For it matters not even if we speak of what is generate, as `become' or `made;' but on the contrary, things originate cannot be called generate, God's handiwork as they are, except so far as after their making they partake of the generate Son, and are therefore said to have been generated also, not at all in their own nature, but because of their participation of the Son in the Spirit[fn-56-P5697_2261775:338-nf] .

If moreover, baffled so far, they should still violently insist that the language is that of comparison, and that comparison in consequence implies oneness of kind, so that the Son is of the nature of Angels, they will in the first price incur the disgrace of rivalling and repeating what Valentinus held, and Carpocrates, and those other heretics, of whom the former said that the Angels were one in kind with the Christ, and Carpocrates that Angels are framers of the world[fn-57-P5704_2263214:344-nf] . Perchance it is under the instruction of these masters that they compare the Word of God with the Angels.57. Though surely amid such speculations, they will be moved by the sacred poet, saying, `Who is he among the gods that shall be like unto the Lord[fn-57-P5705_2263886:345-nf] ,' and, `Among the gods there is none like unto Thee, O Lord[fn-57-P5706_2263969:346-nf] .' However, they must be answered, with the chance of their profiting by it, that comparison confessedly does belong to subjects one in kind, not to those which differ. No one, for instance, would compare God with man, or again man with brutes, nor wood with stone, because their natures are unlike; but God is beyond comparison, and man is compared to man, and wood to wood, and stone to stone. Now in such cases we should not speak of `better,' but of `rather' and `more;' thus Joseph was comely rather than his brethren, and Rachel than Leah; star[fn-57-P5707_2264546:347-nf] is not better than star, but is the rather excellent in glory; whereas in bringing together things which differ in kind, then `better' is used to mark the difference, as has been said in the case of wisdom and jewels. Had then the Apostle said, `by so much has the Son precedence of the Angels,' or `by so much greater,' you would have had a plea, as if the Son were compared with the Angels; but, as it is, in saying that He is `better,' and differs as far as Son from servants, the Apostle shews that He is other than the Angels in nature. (6.) Moreover by saying that He it is who has `laid the foundation of all things[fn-57-P5708_2265192:348-nf] ,' he shews that He is other than all things originate. But if He be other and different in essence from their nature, what comparison of His essence can[fn-57-P5709_2265365:349-nf] there be, or what likeness to them? though, even if they have any such thoughts, Paul shall refute them, who speaks to the very point, `For unto which of the Angels said He at any time, Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee? And of the Angels He saith, Who maketh His Angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire[fn-57-P5710_2265719:350-nf] .'58. Observe here, the word `made' belongs to things originate, and he calls them things made; but to the Son he speaks not of making, nor of becoming, hut of eternity and kingship, and a Framer's office, exclaiming, `Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever;' and, `Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of Thine hands; they shall perish, but Thou remainest.' From which words even they, were they but willing, might perceive that the Framer is other than things framed, the former God, the latter things originate, made out of nothing. For what has been said, `They shall perish,' is said, not as if the creation were destined for destruction, but to express the nature of things originate by the issue to which they tend[fn-57-P5711_2266521:351-nf] . For things which admit of perishing, though through the grace[fn-57-P5712_2266606:352-nf] of their Maker they perish not, yet have come out of nothing, and themselves witness that they once were not. And on this account, since their nature is such, it is said of the Son, `Thou remainest,' to shew His eternity; for not having the capacity of perishing, as things originate have, but having eternal duration, it is foreign to Him to have it said, `He was not before His generation,' but proper to Him to be always, and to endure together with the Father. And though the Apostle had not thus written in his Epistle to the Hebrews, still his other Epistles, and the whole of Scripture, would certainly forbid their entertaining such notions concerning the Word. But since he has here expressly written it, and, as has been above shewn, the Son is Offspring of the Father's essence, and He is Framer, and other things are framed by Him, and He is the Radiance and Word and Image and Wisdom of the Father, and things originate stand and serve in their place below the Triad, therefore the Son is different in kind and different in essence from things originate, and on the contrary is proper to the Father's essence and one in nature with it[fn-57-P5713_2267782:353-nf] . And Hence it is that the Son too says not, `My Father is better than I[fn-57-P5714_2268053:354-nf] ,' lest we should conceive Him to be foreign to His Nature, but `greater,' not indeed in greatness, nor in time, but because of His generation from the Father Himself[fn-57-P5715_2268241:355-nf] , nay, in saying `greater' He again shows that He is proper to His essence.","index":"106","references":[{"fn":"57","code":"P5704_2263214","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"These tenets and similar ones were common to many branches of the Gnostics, who paid worship to the Angels, or ascribed to them the creation; the doctrine of their consubstantiality with our Lord arose from their belief in emanation.

Certainly what the Apostle proceeds to say shews the excellence of the Son over things originate; `Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard. lest at any time we should let them slip. For if the word spoken by Angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward; how shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard Him[fn-57-P5720_2269852:358-nf] .' But if the Son were in the number of things originate, He was not better than they, nor did disobedience involve increase of punishment because of Him; any more than in the Ministry of Angels there was not, according to each Angel, greater or less guilt in the transgressors, but the Law was one, and one was its vengeance on transgressors. But, whereas the Word is not in the number of originate things, but is Son of the Father, therefore, as He Himself is better and His acts better and transcendent, so also the punishment is worse. Let them contemplate then the grace which is through the Son, and let them acknowledge the witness which He gives even from His works. that He is other than things originated, and alone the very Son in the Father and the Father in Him. And the Law[fn-57-P5721_2270662:359-nf] was spoken by Angels, and perfected no one[fn-57-P5722_2271072:360-nf] , needing the visitation of the Word, as Paul hath said; but that visitation has perfected the work of the Father. And then, from Adam unto Moses death reigned[fn-57-P5723_2271252:361-nf] ; but the presence of the Word abolished death[fn-57-P5724_2271318:362-nf] .

And then what was revealed was but a type; but now the truth has been manifested. And this again the Apostle himself describes afterwards more clearly, saying, `By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament;' and again, `But now hath He obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also He is the Mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.' And, `For the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did.' And again he says, `It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these[fn-57-P5729_2272550:367-nf] .' Both in the verse before us, then, and throughout, does he ascribe the word `better' to the Lord, who is better and other than originated things. For better is the sacrifice through Him, better the hope in Him; and also the promises through Him, not merely as great compared with small, but the one differing from the other in nature, because He who conducts this economy, is `better' than things originated.","index":"108","references":[{"fn":"57","code":"P5720_2269852","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Heb. ii. 1-3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"hebrews","chapter":2,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"57","code":"P5721_2270662","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"cf. supr. 33, note 2.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"57","code":"P5722_2271072","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Heb. vii. 19","bible_refs":[{"book":"hebrews","chapter":7,"verses":[19]}]},{"fn":"57","code":"P5723_2271252","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Rom. v. 14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":5,"verses":[14]}]},{"fn":"57","code":"P5724_2271318","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"2 Tim. i. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 timothy","chapter":1,"verses":[10]}]},{"fn":"57","code":"P5725_2271380","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"1 Cor. xv. 22.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":15,"verses":[22]}]},{"fn":"57","code":"P5726_2271644","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Is. xi. 9; vid.

And then, should one and the other of these benefited persons say, `Such a one became an assistance to me,' and another `and to me a refuge,' and `to another a supply,' yet in so saying would not be speaking of the original becoming or of the essence of their benefactors, but of the beneficence coming to themselves from them; so also when the saints say concerning God, `He became' and `become Thou,' they do not denote any original becoming, for God is without beginning and unoriginate, but the salvation which is made to be unto men from Him.","index":"114","references":[{"fn":"57","code":"P5755_2281806","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Is. lviii. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":58,"verses":[9]}]}]},{"text":"64.
