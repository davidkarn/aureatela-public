Prolegg, ch. ii. §9, and ch. v. §3, h. and supr. p. 487. Athanasius, on the first news of Julian's death, by a secret and rapid journey, succeeded in meeting Jovian, when still beyond the Euphrates on his return from the East. He thus secured the ear of the new Emperor before the Arian deputation from Alexandria could reach him. The letter before us (Migne xxvi. 813) was drawn up at Antioch, as it would seem in response to a request from Jovian on a doctrinal statement. The short letter of Jovian prefixed to the Epistle is a formal authorisation for the bishop's return to his see, with which, taught by his experience under Julian, he was careful to arm himself. The documents given as an appendix are notes made at Antioch, and carefully preserved, of the reception given by Jovian to the Arian deputation. They are probably the `exemplaria' referred to in Hist. Aceph. §14 (see note there). They are characteristic, and interesting in many ways; among others, as shewing how accurately Jovian had been primed by Athanasius with the leading facts of his case.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"1. A Desire to learn and a yearning for heavenly things is suitable to a religious Emperor; for thus you will truly have `your heart' also `in the hand of God[fn-99-P9969_3566179:2-nf] .' Since then your Piety desired[fn-99-P9970_3566497:3-nf] to learn from us the faith of the Catholic Church, giving thanks for these things to the Lord, we counselled above all things to remind your Piety of the faith confessed by the Fathers at Nicaea. For this certain set at nought, while plotting against us in many ways, because we would not comply with the Arian heresy, and they have become authors of heresy and schisms in the Catholic Church. For the true and pious faith in the Lord has become manifest to all, being both `known and read[fn-99-P9971_3567035:4-nf] ' from the Divine Scriptures. For in it both the saints were made perfect and suffered martyrdom, and now are departed in the Lord; and the faith would have abode inviolate always had not the wickedness of certain heretics presumed to tamper with it. For a certain Arius and those with him attempted to corrupt it, and to introduce impiety in its place, affirming that the Son of God was from nought, and a creature, and a thing made and changeable. But with these words they deceived many, so that even `they that seemed to be somewhat were carried away[fn-99-P9972_3567608:5-nf] ,' with their blasphemy. And yet our holy Fathers, as we said before, came promptly together at the Synod at Nicaea, and anathematised them, and confessed in writing the faith of the Catholic Church, so that, this being everywhere preached, the heresy kindled by the heretics might be quenched. This faith then was everywhere in every Church sincerely known and preached. But since now certain who wish to renew the Arian heresy have presumed to set at nought this faith confessed at Nicaea by the Fathers, and while pretending to confess it, do in fact deny it, explaining away the `Coessential[fn-99-P9973_3568232:6-nf] ,' and blaspheming of their own accord[fn-99-P9974_3568338:7-nf] against the Holy Spirit, in affirming that It is a creature, and came into being as a thing made by the Son, we hasten as of bounden duty, in view of the injury resulting to the people from such blasphemy, to hand to your Piety the faith confessed at Nicaea; in order that thy religiousness may know what has been written with all accuracy, and how far wrong they are who teach contrary to it.","index":"8","references":[{"fn":"99","code":"P9969_3566179","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Prov. xxi. 1.

By this faith, Augustus, all must needs abide, as Divine and Apostolic, and none must unsettle it by plausibilities, and contentions about words, which is what the Arian madmen have done, saying that the Son of God is from nought, and that once there was when He was not, and that He is created, and made and changeable. For for this cause, as we said before, the Synod at Nicaea anathematised such heresy, but confessed the faith of the truth. For they have not merely said that the Son islike[fn-99-P9982_3571127:12-nf] the Father, lest He should be believed merely like God, instead of Very God from God; but they wrote `Coessential,' which was peculiar to a genuine and true Son, truly and naturally from the Father.

Emperor: `I told you that the case of Athanasius was already settled,' (and then angrily) `feri, feri[fn-99-P9993_3573939:14-nf] !' The Arians: `May it please you, if you send Athanasius, our city is ruined, and no one assembles with him.' Emperor: `Yet I took pains, and ascertained that he holds right opinions and is orthodox, and teaches aright.' The Arians: `With his mouth he utters what is right, but in his soul he harbours guile.' Emperor: `That will do, you have testified of him, that he utters what is right and teaches aright, but if he teaches and speaks aright with his tongue, but harbours evil thoughts in his soul, it concerns him before God.
