For that God who brought Israel out of Egypt, even He at this time calls us to the feast, saying by Moses, `Observe the month of new fruits[fn-90-P9054_3305510:2-nf] , and keep the Passover to the Lord thy God[fn-90-P9055_3305574:3-nf] :' and by the prophet, `Keep thy feasts, O Judah; `pay to the Lord thy vows[fn-90-P9056_3305667:4-nf] .' If then God Himself loves the feast, and calls us to it, it is not right, my brethren, that it should be delayed, or observed carelessly; but with alacrity and zeal we should come to it, so that having begun joyfully here, we may also receive an earnest of that heavenly feast. For if we diligently celebrate the feast here, we shall doubtless receive the perfect joy which is in heaven, as the Lord says; `With desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. For I say unto you, that I will not eat it, until it is fulfilled with you in the kingdom of God[fn-90-P9057_3306265:5-nf] .' Now we eat it if, understanding the reason of the feast, and acknowledging the Deliverer, we conduct ourselves in accordance with His grace, as Paul saith; `So that we may keep the Feast, not with old leaven neither with the leaven of wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth[fn-90-P9058_3306601:6-nf] .' For the Lord died in those days, that we should no longer do the deeds of death. He gave His life, that we might preserve our own from the snares of the devil. And, what is most wonderful, the Word became flesh, that we should no longer live in the flesh, but in spirit should worship God, who is Spirit. He who is not so disposed, abuses the days, and does not keep the feast, but like an unthankful person finds fault with the grace, and honours the days overmuch, while he does not supplicate the Lord who in those days redeemed him. Let him by all means hear, though fancying that he keeps the feast, the Apostolic voice reproving him; `Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years: I fear test I have laboured among you in vain[fn-90-P9059_3307358:7-nf] .'","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"90","code":"P9054_3305510","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Cf. i. 9, n. 12.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"90","code":"P9055_3305574","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Deut. xvi, 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"deuteronomy","chapter":16,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"90","code":"P9056_3305667","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Nahum i. 13.","bible_refs":[{"book":"nahum","chapter":1,"verses":[13]}]},{"fn":"90","code":"P9057_3306265","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Luke xxii. 15, Luke xxii. 16.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":22,"verses":[15]},{"book":"luke","chapter":22,"verses":[16]}]},{"fn":"90","code":"P9058_3306601","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"1 Cor. v. 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":5,"verses":[8]}]},{"fn":"90","code":"P9059_3307358","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Gal. iv. 10, Gal. iv. 11.","bible_refs":[{"book":"galatians","chapter":4,"verses":[10]},{"book":"galatians","chapter":4,"verses":[11]}]}]},{"text":"2.

To the Jews, when they thought they were keeping the Passover, because they persecuted the Lord, the feast was useless; since it no longer bore the name of the Lord, even according to their own testimony. It was not the Passover of the Lord, but that of the Jews[fn-90-P9063_3307988:10-nf] . The Passover was named after the Jews, my brethren, because they denied the Lord of the Passover.

So now, those who keep the Passover in like manner, the Lord again reproves, as He did those lepers who were cleansed, when He loved the one as thankful, but was angry with the others as ungrateful, because they did not acknowledge their Deliverer, but thought more of the cure of the leprosy than of Him who healed them. `But one of them when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God, and fell on his If ace at the feet of Jesus giving Him thanks; and he was a Samaritan.

And there was more given to him than to the rest; for being cleansed from his leprosy, he heard from the Lord, `Arise, go thy way, thy faith hath saved thee[fn-90-P9067_3309224:13-nf] .' For he who gives thanks, and he who glorifies, have kindred feelings, in that they bless their Helper for the benefits they have received. So the Apostle exhorts all men to this, saying, `Glorify God with your body;' and the prophet commands, saying, `Give glory to God.' Although testimony was borne by Caiaphas[fn-90-P9068_3309553:14-nf] against our Redeemer, and He was set at nought by the Jews, and was condemned by Pilate in those days, yet exalted exceedingly and most mighty was the voice of the Father which came to Him; `I have glorified, and will glorify again[fn-90-P9069_3309834:15-nf] .'

But in our commemoration of these things, my brethren, let us not be occupied with meats, but let us glorify the Lord, let us become fools for Him who died for us, even as Paul said; `For if we are foolish, it is to God; or if we are sober-minded, it is to you; since because one died for all men, therefore all were dead to Him; and He died for all, that we who live should not henceforth live to ourselves, but to Him who died for us, and rose again[fn-90-P9071_3310438:16-nf] .'

Full well did He once, in a certain place, blame those who participated vainly in the shedding of His blood, while they did not delight themselves in the flesh of the Word, saying, `What profit is there in my blood, that I go down to corruption[fn-90-P9075_3311314:20-nf] ?' This does not mean that the descent of the Lord was without profit, for it gained the whole world; but rather that after He had thus suffered, sinners would prefer to suffer loss than to profit by it.

Also in the Gospel, He praises those who increased the grace twofold, both him who made ten talents of five, and him who made four talents of two, as those who had profited, and turned them to good account; but him who hid the talent He cast out as wanting, saying to him, `Thou wicked servant! oughtest thou not to have put My money to the exchangers? then at My coming I should have received Mine own with interest. Take, therefore, from him the talent, and give it to him that hath ten talents.

But Israel despised and would not render, for their will was not right, nay moreover they killed those that were sent, and not even before the Lord of the vineyard were they ashamed, but even He was slain by them. Verily, when He came and found no fruit in them, He cursed them through the fig-tree, saying, `Let there be henceforth no fruit from thee[fn-90-P9081_3313418:25-nf] ;' and the fig-tree was dead and fruitless so that even the disciples wondered when it withered away.","index":"7","references":[{"fn":"90","code":"P9077_3312416","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Matt. xxv. 26-30.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":25,"verses":[26]}]},{"fn":"90","code":"P9078_3312661","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Gal. v. 22.","bible_refs":[{"book":"galatians","chapter":5,"verses":[22]}]},{"fn":"90","code":"P9079_3312878","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Rom. xiii. 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":13,"verses":[7]}]},{"fn":"90","code":"P9080_3313000","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Matt. xxi. 33.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":21,"verses":[33]}]},{"fn":"90","code":"P9081_3313418","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Ib. 19.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"6.

For the whole service of the law has been abolished from them, and henceforth and for ever they remain without a feast. And they observe not the Passover; for how can they? They have no abiding place, but they wander everywhere. And they eat unleavened bread contrary to the law, since they are unable first to sacrifice the lamb, as they were commanded to do when eating unleavened bread. But in every place they transgress the law, and as the judgments of God require, they keep days of grief instead of gladness. Now the cause of this to them was the slaying of the Lord, and that they did not reverence the Only-Begotten. At this time the altogether wicked heretics and ignorant schismatics are in the same case; the one in that they slay the Word, the other in that they rend the coat. They too remain expelled from the feast, because they live without godliness and knowledge, and emulate the conduct shewn in the matter of Bar-Abbas the robber, whom the Jews desired instead of the Saviour. Therefore the Lord cursed them under the figure of the fig-tree. Yet even thus He spared them in His loving-kindness, not destroying them root and all. For He did not curse the root, but [said], that no man should eat fruit of it thenceforth.

For he,' as the Psalmist adds, when he goes up, `shall receive a blessing from the Lord[fn-91-P9110_3321829:48-nf] .' Now this clearly also refers to what the Lord gives to them at the right hand, saying, `Come, ye blessed, inherit the kingdom prepared for you[fn-91-P9111_3321993:49-nf] .' But the deceitful, and he that is not pure of heart, and possesses nothing that is pure (as the Proverb saith, `To a deceitful man there is nothing good[fn-91-P9112_3322169:50-nf] '), shall assuredly, being a stranger, and of a different race from the saints, be accounted unworthy to eat the Passover, for `a foreigner shall not eat of it[fn-91-P9113_3322356:51-nf] .' Thus Judas, when he thought he kept the Passover, because he plotted deceit against the Saviour, was estranged from the city which is above, and from the apostolic company. For the law commanded the Passover to be eaten with due observance; but he, while eating it, was sifted of the devil[fn-91-P9114_3322669:52-nf] , who had entered his soul.","index":"13","references":[{"fn":"91","code":"P9108_3321170","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Ps. xlii. 4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":42,"verses":[4]}]},{"fn":"91","code":"P9109_3321330","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Is. ii. 3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":2,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"91","code":"P9110_3321829","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Ps. xxiv. 3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":24,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"91","code":"P9111_3321993","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Matt. xxv. 34.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":25,"verses":[34]}]},{"fn":"91","code":"P9112_3322169","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Prov. xiii. 13, LXX.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","chapter":13,"verses":[13]}]},{"fn":"91","code":"P9113_3322356","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Exod. xii. 43.","bible_refs":[{"book":"exodus","chapter":12,"verses":[43]}]},{"fn":"91","code":"P9114_3322669","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Cf.

Wherefore let us not celebrate the feast after an earthly manner, but as keeping festival in heaven with the angels. Let us glorify the Lord, by chastity, by righteousness, and other virtues.

Let us watch like David who rose seven times, and in the middle of the night gave thanks for the righteous judgments of God.
