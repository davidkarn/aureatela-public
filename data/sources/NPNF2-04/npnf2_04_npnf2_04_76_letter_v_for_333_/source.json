Again the time has arrived which brings to us a new beginning[fn-90-P9020_3293582:3-nf] , even the announcement of the blessed Passover, in which the Lord was sacrificed. We eat, as it were, the food of life, and constantly thirsting we delight our souls at all times, as from a fountain, in His precious blood. For we continually and ardently desire; He stands ready for those who thirst; and for those who thirst there is the word of our Saviour, which, in His loving-kindness, He uttered on the day of the feast; `If any man thirst, let him come to Me and drink[fn-90-P9021_3294097:4-nf] .' Nor was it then alone when any one drew near to Him, that He cured his thirst; but whenever any one seeks, there is free access for him to the Saviour. For the grace of the feast is not limited to one time, nor does its splendid brilliancy decline; but it is always near, enlightening the minds of those who earnestly desire it[fn-90-P9022_3294480:5-nf] . For therein is constant virtue, for those who are illuminated in their minds, and meditate on the divine Scriptures day and night, like the man to whom a blessing is given, as it is written in the sacred Psalms; `Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of corrupters. But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in His law doth he meditate day and night[fn-90-P9023_3294951:6-nf] .' For it is not the sun, or the moon, or the host of those other stars which illumines him, but he glitters with the high effulgence of God over all.","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"90","code":"P9020_3293582","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Cf.

He both brought about the slaying of His Son for salvation, and gave us this reason for the holy feast, to which every year bears witness, as often as at this season the feast is proclaimed. This also leads us on from the cross through this world to that which is before us, and God produces even now from it the joy of glorious salvation, bringing us to the same assembly, and in every place uniting all of us in spirit; appointing us common prayers, and a common grace proceeding from the feast. For this is the marvel of His loving-kindness, that He should gather together in the same place those who are at a distance; and make those who appear to be far off in the body, to be near together in unity of spirit.","index":"4","references":[]},{"text":"3. Wherefore then, my beloved, do we not acknowledge the grace as becometh the feast? Wherefore do we not make a return to our Benefactor? It is indeed impossible to make an adequate return to God; still, it is a wicked thing for us who receive the gracious gift, not to acknowledge it. Nature itself manifests our inability; but our own will reproves our unthankfulness. Therefore the blessed Paul, when admiring the greatness of the gift of God, said, `And who is sufficient for these things[fn-90-P9026_3296471:7-nf] ?' For He made the world free by the blood of the Saviour; then, again, He has caused the grave to be trodden down by the Saviour's death, and furnished a way to the heavenly gates free from obstacles to those who are going up[fn-90-P9027_3296716:8-nf] . Wherefore, one of the saints, while he acknowledged the grace, but was insufficient to repay it, said, `What shall I render unto the Lord for all He has done unto me[fn-90-P9028_3296971:9-nf] ?' For instead of death he had received life, instead of bondage[fn-90-P9029_3297054:10-nf] , freedom, and instead of the grave, the kingdom of heaven. For of old time, `death reigned from Adam to Moses;' but now the divine voice hath said, `To-day shalt thou be with Me in Paradise.' And the saints, being sensible of this, said, `Except the Lord had helped me, my soul had almost dwelt in hell.[fn-90-P9030_3297593:11-nf] .' Besides all this, being powerless to make a return, he yet acknowledged the gift, and wrote finally, saying, `I will take the cup of salvation, and call on the name of the Lord; precious in His sight is the death of His saints[fn-90-P9031_3297870:12-nf] .'","index":"5","references":[{"fn":"90","code":"P9026_3296471","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"2 Cor. ii. 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":2,"verses":[17]}]},{"fn":"90","code":"P9027_3296716","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"This sentence is preserved in the original Greek in Cosmas, Tapogr.

Therefore, my beloved, let us be sensible of the gift, though we are found insufficient to repay it. As we have ability, let us meet the occasion. For although nature is not able, with things unworthy of the Word, to return a recompense for such benefits, yet let us render Him thanks while we persevere in piety. And how can we more abide in piety than when we acknowledge God, Who in His love to mankind has bestowed on us such benefits? (For thus we shall obediently keep the law, and observe its commandments. And, further, we shall not, as unthankful persons, be accounted transgressors of the law, or do those things which ought to be hated, for the Lord loveth the thankful); when too we offer ourselves to the Lord, like the saints, when we subscribe ourselves entirely [as] living henceforth not to ourselves, but to the Lord Who died for us, as also the blessed Paul did, when he said, `I am crucified with Christ, yet I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me[fn-90-P9034_3299213:14-nf] .'","index":"6","references":[{"fn":"90","code":"P9033_3298206","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Matt. xx. 22, Matt. xx. 23","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":20,"verses":[22]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":20,"verses":[23]}]},{"fn":"90","code":"P9034_3299213","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Gal. ii. 20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"galatians","chapter":2,"verses":[20]}]}]},{"text":"4. Now our life, my brethren, truly consists in our denying all bodily things, and continuing stedfast in those only of our Saviour. Therefore the present season requires of us, that we should not only utter such words, but should also imitate the deeds of the saints. But we imitate them, when we acknowledge Him who died, and no longer live unto ourselves, but Christ henceforth lives in us; when we render a recompense to the Lord to the utmost of our power, though when we make a return we give nothing of our own, but those things which we have before received from Him, this being especially of His grace, that He should require, as from us, His own gifts. He bears witness to this when He says, `My offerings are My own gifts[fn-90-P9036_3299966:15-nf] .' That is, those things which you give Me are yours, as having received them from Me, but they are the gifts of God. And let us offer to the Lord every virtue, and that true holiness which is in Him, and in piety let us keep the feast to Him with those things which He has hallowed for us. Let us thus engage in the holy fasts, as having been prescribed by Him, and by means of which we find the way to God. But let us not be like the heathen, or the ignorant Jews, or as the heretics and schismatics of the present time. For the heathen think the accomplishment of the feast is in the abundance of food; the Jews, erring in the type and shadow, think it still such; the schismatics keep it in separate places, and with vain imaginations. But let us, my brethren, be superior to the heathen, in keeping the feast with sincerity of soul, and purity of body; to the Jews, in no longer receiving the type and the shadow, but as having been gloriously illumined with the light of truth, and as looking upon the Sun of Righteousness[fn-90-P9037_3301022:16-nf] ; to the schismatics, in not rending the coat of Christ, but in one house, even in the Catholic Church, let us eat the Passover of the Lord, Who, by ordaining His holy laws, guided us towards virtue, and counselled the abstinence of this feast. For the Passover is indeed abstinence from evil for exercise of virtue, and a departure from death unto life. This may be learnt even from the type of old time. For then they toiled earnestly to pass from Egypt to Jerusalem, but now we depart from death to life; they then passed from Pharaoh to Moses, but now we rise from the devil to the Saviour. And as, at that time, the type of deliverance bore witness every year, so now we commemorate our salvation. We fast meditating on death, that we may be able to live; and we watch, not as mourners, but as they that wait for the Lord, when He shall have returned from the wedding, so that we may vie with each other in the triumph, hastening to announce the sign of victory over death.","index":"7","references":[{"fn":"90","code":"P9036_3299966","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Num. xxviii. 2, LXX.","bible_refs":[{"book":"numbers","chapter":28,"verses":[2]}]},{"fn":"90","code":"P9037_3301022","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Mal. iv. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"malachi","chapter":4,"verses":[2]}]}]},{"text":"5. Would therefore, O my beloved, that as the word requires, we might here so govern ourselves at all times and entirely, and so live, as never to forget the noble acts of God, nor to depart from the practice of virtue! As also the Apostolic voice exhorts; `Remember Jesus Christ, that He rose from the dead[fn-90-P9039_3302325:17-nf] .' Not that any limited season of remembrance was appointed, for at all times He should be in our thoughts. But because of the slothfulness of many, we delay from day to day. Let us then begin in these days. To this end a time of remembrance is permitted, that it may show forth to the saints the reward of their calling, and may exhort the careless while reproving them[fn-90-P9040_3302715:18-nf] . Therefore in all the remaining days, let us persevere in virtuous conduct, repenting as is our duty, of all that we have neglected, whatever it may be; for there is no one free from defilement, though his course may have been but one hour on the earth, as Job, that man of surpassing fortitude, testifies. But, `stretching forth to those things that are to come[fn-90-P9041_3303325:19-nf] ,' let us pray that we may not eat the Passover unworthily, lest we be exposed to dangers. For to those who keep the feast in purity, the Passover is heavenly food; but to those who observe it profanely and contemptuously, it is a danger and reproach. For it is written, `Whosoever shall eat and drink unworthily, is guilty of the death of our Lord[fn-90-P9042_3303713:20-nf] .' Wherefore, let us not merely proceed to perform the festal rites, but let us be prepared to draw near to the divine Lamb, and to touch heavenly food. Let us cleanse our hands, let us purify the body. Let us keep our whole mind from guile; not giving up ourselves to excess, and to lusts, but occupying ourselves entirely with our Lord, and with divine doctrines; so that, being altogether pure, we may be able to partake of the Word[fn-90-P9043_3304169:21-nf] ","index":"8","references":[{"fn":"90","code":"P9039_3302325","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"2 Tim. ii. 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 timothy","chapter":2,"verses":[8]}]},{"fn":"90","code":"P9040_3302715","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"The reasoning of Athan, is to this effect.
