Would any one regard their habits and feelings as human, and not rather those of wild beasts, seeing their cruel and savage conduct? They are more worthless than public hangmen; more audacious than all other heretics. To the Gentiles they are much inferior, and stand far apart and separate from them[fn-50-P5060_1996487:1-nf] . I have heard from our fathers, and I believe their report to be a faithful one, that long ago, when a persecution arose in the time[fn-50-P5061_1996635:2-nf] of Maximian, the grandfather of Constantius, the Gentiles concealed our brethren the Christians, who were sought after, and frequently suffered the loss of their own substance, and had trial of imprisonment, solely that they might not betray the fugitives. They protected those who fled to them for refuge, as they would have done their own persons, and were determined to run all risks on their behalf. But now these admirable persons, the inventors of a new heresy, act altogether the contrary part; and are distinguished for nothing but their treachery. They have appointed themselves as executioners, and seek to betray all alike, and make those who conceal others the objects of their plots, esteeming equally as their enemy both him that conceals and him that is concealed. So murderous are they; so emulous in their evil-doings of the wickedness of Judas.","index":"20","references":[{"fn":"50","code":"P5060_1996487","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"§§20, 29.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"50","code":"P5061_1996635","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"303 a.d.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"\n65.

I would only say, that as I write and wish to enumerate all their deeds of iniquity, the thought enters my mind, whether this heresy be not the fourth daughter of the horse-leach[fn-50-P5065_1997793:3-nf] in the Proverbs, since after so many acts of injustice, so many murders, it hath not yet said, `It is enough.' No; it still rages, and goes about[fn-50-P5066_1997957:4-nf] seeking after those whom it has not yet discovered, while those whom it has already injured, it is eager to injure anew. After the night attack, after the evils committed in consequence of it, after the persecution brought about by Heraclius, they cease not yet to accuse us falsely before the Emperor (and they are confident that as impious persons they will obtain a hearing), desiring that something more than banishment may be inflicted upon us, and that hereafter those who do not consent to their impieties may be destroyed. Accordingly, being now emboldened in an extreme degree, that most abandoned Secundus[fn-50-P5067_1998636:5-nf] of Pentapolis, and Stephanus[fn-50-P5068_1998680:6-nf] his accomplice, conscious that their heresy was a defence of any injustice they might commit, on discovering a Presbyter at Barka who would not comply with their desires (he was called Secundus, being of the same name, but not of the same faith with the heretic), they kicked him till he died[fn-50-P5069_1999030:7-nf] . While he was thus suffering he imitated the Saint, and said, `Let no one avenge my cause before human judges; I have the Lord for my avenger, for whose sake I suffer these things at their hands.'

For in truth it is but a lately invented evil; and although certain heretofore appear to have adopted its doctrines, yet they concealed them, and were not known to hold them. But Eusebius and Arius, like serpents coming out of their holes, have vomited forth the poison of this impiety; Arius daring to blasphemy openly, and[fn-50-P5074_2000015:9-nf] Eusebius defending his blasphemy. He was not however able to support the heresy, until, as I said before, he found a patron[fn-50-P5075_2000157:10-nf] for it in the Emperor. Our fathers called an Ecumenical Council, when three hundred of them, more or less[fn-50-P5076_2000273:11-nf] , met together and condemned the Arian heresy, and all declared that it was alien and strange to the faith of the Church. Upon this its supporters, perceiving that they were dishonoured, and had now no good ground of argument to insist upon, devised a different method, and attempted to vindicate it by means of external power. And herein one may especially admire the novelty as well as wickedness of their device, and how they go beyond all other heresies. For these support their madness by persuasive arguments calculated to deceive the simple; the Greeks, as the Apostle has said, make their attack with excellency and persuasiveness of speech, and with plausible fallacies; the Jews, leaving the divine Scriptures, now, as the Apostle again has said, contend about `fables and endless genealogies[fn-50-P5077_2001095:12-nf] ;' and the Manichees and Valentinians with them, and others, corrupting the divine Scriptures, put forth fables in terms of their own inventions. But the Arians are bolder than them all, and have shewn that the other heresies are but their younger sisters[fn-50-P5078_2001368:13-nf] , whom, as I have said, they surpass in impiety, emulating them all, and especially the Jews in their iniquity. For as the Jews, when they were unable to prove the charges which they pretended to allege against Paul, straightway led him to the chief captain and the governor; so likewise these men, who surpass the Jews in their devices, make use only of the power of the judges; and if any one so much as speaks against them, he is dragged before the Governor or the General.

But this modern and accursed heresy, when it is overthrown by argument, when it is cast down and covered with shame by the very Truth, forthwith endeavours to coerce by violence and stripes and imprisonment those whom it has been unable to persuade by argument, thereby acknowledging itself to be anything rather than godly. For it is the part of true godliness not to compel[fn-50-P5082_2002455:14-nf] , but to persuade, as I said before. Thus our Lord Himself, not as employing force, but as offering to their free choice, has said to all, `If any man will follow after Me[fn-50-P5083_2004829:15-nf] ;' and to His disciples, `Will ye also go away[fn-50-P5084_2004896:16-nf] ?'

And as Saul overthrew Nob, the city of the priests, so this man, advancing even further in wickedness, has given up the Churches to the impious. And as he honoured Doeg the accuser before the true priests, and persecuted David, giving ear to the Ziphires; so this man prefers heretics to the godly, and still persecutes them that flee from him, giving ear to his own eunuchs, who falsely accuse the orthodox: He does not perceive that whatever he does or writes in behalf of the heresy of the Arians, involves an attack[fn-50-P5087_2006238:19-nf] upon the Saviour.","index":"26","references":[{"fn":"50","code":"P5082_2002455","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"so Pius IX. in Encycl. `Quanta cura,' speaks of the 'officium coercendi sancitis poenis violatores catholicae religionis","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"50","code":"P5083_2004829","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Matt. xvi. 24.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[24]}]},{"fn":"50","code":"P5084_2004896","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"John vi. 67.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":6,"verses":[67]}]},{"fn":"50","code":"P5085_2005146","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Cf.

And the most extraordinary instance of his iniquity was the following. It happened that when the Bishops were condemned to banishment, certain other persons also received their sentence on charges of murder or sedition or theft, each according to the quality of his offence. These men after a few months he released, on being requested to do so, as Pilate did Barabbas; but the servants of Christ he not only refused to set at liberty, but even sentenced them to more unmerciful punishment in the place of their exile, proving himself `an undying evil[fn-50-P5092_2007406:21-nf] ' to them. To the others through congeniality of disposition he became a friend; but to the orthodox he was an enemy on account of their true faith in Christ.

And when the doors were burst open by the violence of the multitude, he gave command, and some of them were shooting; others shouting, their arms rattling, and their swords flashing in the light of the lamps; and forthwith virgins were being slain, many men trampled down, and falling over one another as the soldiers came upon them, and several were pierced with arrows and perished. Some of the soldiers also were betaking themselves to plunder, and were stripping the virgins, who were more afraid of being even touched by them than they were of death. The Bishop continued sitting upon his throne, and exhorted all to pray. The Duke led on the attack, having with him Hilarius the notary, whose part in the proceedings was shewn in the sequel. The Bishop was seized, and barely escaped being torn to pieces; and having fallen into a state of insensibility, and appearing as one dead, he disappeared from among them, and has gone we know not whither. They were eager to kill him. And when they saw that many had perished, they gave orders to the soldiers to remove out of sight the bodies of the dead. But the most holy virgins who were left behind were buried in the tombs, having attained the glory of martyrdom in the times of the most religious Constantius. Deacons also were beaten with stripes even in the Lord's house, and were shut up there.","index":"57","references":[{"fn":"52","code":"P5200_2038619","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Febr. 9.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"52","code":"P5201_2038715","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Ap.
