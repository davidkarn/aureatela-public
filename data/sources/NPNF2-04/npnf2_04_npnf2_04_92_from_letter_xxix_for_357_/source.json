For when He arose, and rebuked the sea, and silenced the storm, He plainly shewed two things; that the storm of the sea was not from the winds, but from fear of its Lord Who walked upon it, and that the Lord Who rebuked it was not a creature, but rather its Creator, since a creature is not obedient to another creature. For although the Red Sea was divided before by Moses[fn-96-P9684_3471590:3-nf] , yet it was not Moses who did it, for it came to pass, not because he spoke, but because God commanded. And if the sun stood still in Gibeon[fn-96-P9685_3471750:4-nf] , and the moon in the valley of Ajalon, yet this was the work, not of the son of Nun, but of the Lord, Who heard his prayer.

Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria, to his children. May God comfort you. I know moreover that not only this thing saddens you, but also the fact that while others have obtained the churches by violence, you are meanwhile cast out from your places. For they hold the places, but you the Apostolic Faith. They are, it is true, in the places, but outside of the true Faith; while you are outside the places indeed, but the Faith, within you. Let us consider whether is the greater, the place or the Faith. Clearly the true Faith. Who then has lost more, or who possesses more? He who holds the place, or he who holds the Faith? Good indeed is the place, when the Apostolic Faith is preached there, holy is it if the Holy One dwell there. (After a little:) But ye are blessed, who by faith are in the Church, dwell upon the foundations of the faith, and have full satisfaction, even the highest degree of faith which remains among you unshaken. For it has come down to you from Apostolic tradition, and frequently has accursed envy wished to unsettle it, but has not been able. On the contrary, they have rather been cut off by their attempts to do so. For this is it that is written, `Thou art the Son of the Living God[fn-96-P9693_3474044:8-nf] ,' Peter confessing it by revelation of the Father, and being told, `Blessed art thou Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood did not reveal it to theee,' but `My Father Who is in heaven,' and the rest. No one therefore will ever prevail against your Faith, most beloved brethren. For if ever God shall give back the churches (for we think He will) yet without[fn-96-P9694_3474433:9-nf] such restoration of the churches the Faith is sufficient for us. And lest, speaking without the Scriptures, I should [seem to] speak too strongly, it is well to bring you to the testimony of Scriptures, for recollect that the Temple indeed was at Jerusalem; the Temple was not deserted, aliens had invaded it, whence also the Temple being at Jerusalem, those exiles went down to Babylon by the judgment of God, who was proving, or rather correcting them; while manifesting to them in their ignorance punishment [by means] of blood-thirsty enemies[fn-96-P9695_3474998:10-nf] . And aliens indeed had held the Place, but knew not the Lord of the Place, while in that He neither gave answer nor spoke, they were deserted by the truth. What profit then is the Place to them?","index":"7","references":[{"fn":"96","code":"P9693_3474044","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Matt. xvi. 16, Matt. xvi. 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[16]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[17]}]},{"fn":"96","code":"P9694_3474433","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Text corrupt.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"96","code":"P9695_3474998","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Lat. somewhat obscure.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"For behold they that hold the Place are charged by them that love God with making it a den of thieves, and with madly making the Holy Place a house of merchandise, and a house of judicial business for themselves to whom it was unlawful to enter there.

And they think themselves to be within the truth, but are exiled, and in captivity, and [gain] no advantage by the church alone.
