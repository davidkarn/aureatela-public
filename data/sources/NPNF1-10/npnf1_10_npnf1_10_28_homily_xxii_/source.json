So that we are ourselves to blame for our own destruction. Because we do not approach, nor beseech, nor entreat Him, as we ought: but even if we do draw nigh, it is not as persons who have need to receive, neither is it with the proper faith, nor as making demand, but we do all in a gaping and listless way.","index":"40","references":[]},{"text":"7. And yet God would have us demand things of Him, and for this accounts Himself greatly bound to thee.[fn-23-P2316_771630:27-nf] For He alone of all debtors, when the demand is made, counts it a favor, and gives what we have not lent Him. And if He should see him pressing earnestly that makes the demand, He pays down even what He hath not received of us; but if sluggishly, He too keeps on making delays; not through unwillingness to give, but because He is pleased to have the demand made upon Him by us. For this cause He told thee also the example of that friend, who came by night, and asked a loaf;[fn-23-P2317_772155:28-nf] and of the judge that feared not God, nor regarded men.[fn-23-P2318_772232:29-nf] And He stayed not at similitudes, but signified it also in His very actions, when He dismissed that Phoenician woman, having filled her with His great gift.[fn-23-P2319_772413:30-nf] For through her He signified, that He gives to them that ask earnestly, even the things that pertain not to them. \"For it is not meet,\" saith He, \"to take the children's bread, and to give[fn-23-P2320_772643:31-nf] it unto the dogs.\" But for all that He gave, because she demanded of him earnestly. But by the Jews He showed, that to them that are careless, He gives not even their own. They accordingly received nothing, but lost what was their own. And while these, because they asked not, did not receive so much as their very own; she, because she assailed Him with earnestness, had power to obtain even what pertained to others, and the dog received what was the children's. So great a good is importunity. For though thou be a dog, yet being importunate, thou shalt be preferred to the child being negligent: for what things affection accomplishes not, these, all of them, importunity did accomplish. Say not therefore, \"God is an enemy to me, and will not hearken.\" He doth straightway answer thee, continually troubling him, if not because thou art His friend, yet because of thine importunity. And neither the enmity, or the unseasonable time, nor anything else becomes an hindrance. Say not, \"I am unworthy, and do not pray;\" for such was the Syrophoenician woman too. Say not, \"I have sinned much, and am not able to entreat Him whom I have angered;\" for God looks not at the desert, but at the disposition. For if the ruler that feared not God, neither was ashamed of men, was overcome by the widow, much more will He that is good be won over by continual entreaty.","index":"41","references":[{"fn":"23","code":"P2316_771630","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"kai\\ xa/rin e!xei soi tou/ton pollh/n.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"23","code":"P2317_772155","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"Luke xi. 5-8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":11,"verses":[5]}]},{"fn":"23","code":"P2318_772232","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"Luke xviii. 1-8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":18,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"23","code":"P2319_772413","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"Matt. xv. 25-28; Mark vii. 24-30.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":15,"verses":[25]},{"book":"mark","chapter":7,"verses":[24]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":15,"verses":[25]},{"book":"mark","chapter":7,"verses":[24]}]},{"fn":"23","code":"P2320_772643","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"dou=nai.
