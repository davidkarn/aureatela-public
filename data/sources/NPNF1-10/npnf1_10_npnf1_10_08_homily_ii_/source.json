Now if there be need both of an unencum bered mind, and of spiritual grace, that we may mount up to that height; what if there be none of these things, but we draw to ourselves whatever is opposite to them, even a satanical weight? how shall we be able to soar upwards, when dragged down by so great a load? For indeed, should any one attempt to weigh our words as it were in just balances; in ten thousand talents of worldly talk he will scarcely find an hundred pence of spiritual words, or rather, I should say, not even ten farthings. Is it not then a disgrace, and an extreme mockery, that if we have a servant, we make use of him for the most part in things necessary, but being possessed of a tongue, we do not deal with our member so well even as with a slave, but on the contrary make use of it for things unprofitable, and mere makeweights?[fn-3-P364_68866:31-nf] And would it were only for makeweights:[fn-3-P365_68928:32-nf] but now it is for what are contrary and hurtful and in no respect advantageous to us. For if the things that we spoke were profitable to us, they would assuredly be also pleasing to God. But as it is, whatever the devil may suggest, we speak it all, now laughing, and now speaking wittily; now cursing and insulting, and now swearing, lying, and taking false oaths; now murmuring, and now making vain babblings, and talking trifles more than old wives; uttering all things that are of no concern to us.","index":"38","references":[{"fn":"3","code":"P363_67832","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"eu0zw/nou>\\=, \"well-girded,\" then figuratively, \"unencumbered.\"-R.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"3","code":"P364_68866","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"parae/lkonta.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"3","code":"P365_68928","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"parae/lkonta.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"For, tell me, who of you that stand here, if he were required, could repeat one Psalm, or any other portion of the divine Scriptures?
