Then in setting forth the difference between himself and Him, lest he should seem to say this out of favor, he establishes the fact by comparison of the gifts bestowed by each of them. For he did not at once say, \"I am not worthy to unloose the lachet of His shoe;\" but when he had first set forth the little value of his own baptism, and had shown that it hath nothing more than to lead them to repentance (for he did not say with water of remission, but of repentance), he sets forth Christ's also, which is full of the unspeakable gift. Thus he seems to say, \"Lest, on being told that He cometh after me, thou shouldest despise Him as having come later; learn thou the virtue[fn-10-P1085_359026:30-nf] of His gift, and thou wilt clearly know that I uttered nothing worthy nor great, when I said, \"I am not worthy to unloose the latchet of His shoe.\" So too when thou art told, \"He is mightier than I,\" do not think I said this in the way of making a comparison.

Yea, this is why the two predictions are put by him in immediate connection, that by that which hath taken place already, he might accredit the other, as yet unaccomplished. For Christ too Himself in many places doth so, often of the same things, and often of opposites, setting down two prophecies; the one of which He performs here, the other He promises in the future; that such as are too contentious may, from the one which has already come to pass, believe the other also. which is not yet accomplished. For instance, to them that strip themselves of all that they have for His sake[fn-11-P1102_365605:39-nf] He promised to give an hundred fold in the present world, and life eternal in that which is to come; by the things already given making the future also credible. Which, as we see, John likewise hath done in this place; laying down two things, that He shall both baptize with the Holy Ghost, and burn up with unquenchable fire. Now then, if He had not baptized with the Spirit the apostles, and all every day who are willing, thou mightest have doubts concerning those other things too; but if that which seems to be greater and more difficult, and which transcends all reason, hath been done, and is done every day; how deniest thou that to be true, which is easy, and comes to pass according to reason? Thus having said, \"He shall baptize with the Holy Ghost and with fire,\" and having thence promised great blessings; lest thou, released wholly from the former things, grow supine, he hath added the fan, and the judgment thereby declared. Thus, \"think not at all,\" saith he, \"that your baptism suffices, if ye become ordinary persons[fn-11-P1103_366676:40-nf] hereafter:\" for we need both virtue, and plenty of that known self-restraint.[fn-11-P1104_366787:41-nf] Therefore as by the axe he urges them unto grace, and unto the font, so after grace he terrifies them by the fan, and the unquenchable fire.
