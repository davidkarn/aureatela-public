For example: since that birth, men come from the ends of the earth to see the manger, and the site of the shed.

For so, when the Virgin was bearing the child, he saith, \"Thou shalt call His name Jesus;\"[fn-7-P725_230160:8-nf] and he gives the reason saying, \"for He shall save His people from their sins.\" And the wise men too said not, \"Where is the Son of God?\" but \"He that is born King of the Jews.\" And here again it is not affirmed, \"Out of thee shall come forth\" the Son of God, but \"a Governor, that shall feed my people Israel.\"[fn-7-P726_230489:9-nf] For it was needful to converse with them at first, setting out in a tone of very exceeding condescension, test they should be offended; and to preach what related to their salvation in particular, that hereby they might be the rather won over. At any rate, all the testimonies that are first cited, and for which it was the season immediately at the time of the birth, say nothing great, nor lofty concerning Him, nor such as those subsequent to the manifestation of the miracles; for these discourse more distinctly concerning His dignity.

For tell me, if any one were to lead[fn-7-P773_247531:32-nf] thee into a palace, and show thee the king on his throne, wouldest thou indeed choose to see the theatre instead of those things? And yet even in the palace there is nothing to gain; but here a spiritual well of fire gushes up out of this table. And thou leavest this, and runnest down to the theatre, to see women swimming, and nature put to open dishonor, leaving Christ sitting by the well? Yes: for now, as of old, He sits down by the well, not discoursing to a Samaritan woman, but to a whole city. Or perchance now too with a Samaritan woman only. For neither now is any one with Him; but some with their bodies only, and some not even with these. But nevertheless, He retires not, but remains, and asks of us to drink, not water, but holiness, for \"His holy things He gives unto the holy.\"[fn-7-P774_248405:33-nf] For it is not water that He gives us from this fountain, but living blood; and it is indeed a symbol of death, but it is become the cause of life.","index":"36","references":[{"fn":"7","code":"P773_247531","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"<\\i>\\ei0sagagei=n e0phggelle/to<\\|i>\\, \"were promising to introduce.\"-R.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"7","code":"P774_248405","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"This expression, Ta= a#gia toi=j a9gi/oij, \"Holy Things for Holy Persons,\" is used in the liturgies of St. Clement, St. James, St. Mark, St. Chrysostom, the Ethiopian liturgy, and that of Severus.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"But thou, leaving the fountain of blood, the awful cup, goest thy way unto the fountain of the devil, to see a harlot swim, and to suffer shipwreck of the soul.

For such is the devil's net; it sinks, not them that go down into the water itself, but them that sit above more than such as wallow therein; and it chokes them more grievously than Pharaoh, who was of old sunk in the sea with his horses and his chariots. And if souls could but be seen, I could show you many floating on these waters, like the bodies of the Egyptians at that time. But what is still more grievous is this, that they even call such utter destruction a delight, and they term the sea of perdition a channel for a pleasure voyage.[fn-7-P776_249654:34-nf] Yet surely one might easier pass over in safety the Aegean or the Tuscan sea, than this spectacle. For in the first place, through a whole night the devil preoccupies their souls with the expectation of it; then having shown them the expected object, he binds them at once, and makes them captives. For think not, because thou hast not been joined unto the harlot, thou art clean from the sin; for in the purpose of thine heart thou hast done it all. Since if thou be taken by lust, thou hast kindled the flame up higher; if thou feel nothing at what thou seest, thou deservest a heavier charge, for being a scandal to others, by encouraging them in these spectacles, and for polluting thine own eye-sight, and together with thine eye-sight, thy soul.","index":"37","references":[{"fn":"7","code":"P776_249654","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"h9donh=j eu!ripon.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"However, not merely to find fault, come let us devise a mode of correction too.
