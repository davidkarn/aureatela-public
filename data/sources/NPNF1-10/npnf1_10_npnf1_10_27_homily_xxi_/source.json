Therefore he so possessed all those things, as if he had been the steward of another man's goods; not only not extorting from others, but even giving up his own to them that were in need.

Be not therefore thus over subtle.[fn-21-P2198_733608:5-nf] Nay, for God hath once for all declared and pronounced it a thing impossible for the one service and the other to agree.
