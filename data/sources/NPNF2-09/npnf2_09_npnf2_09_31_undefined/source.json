For if they define death as the separation of soul and body,\nresurrection surely is the re-union of soul and body, and the second state of\nthe living creature that has suffered dissolution and downfall477 .

For God is just and is the\nrewarder of those who submit patiently to Him. Wherefore if it is the soul\nalone that engages in the contests of virtue, it is also the soul alone that\nwill receive the crown.

But it was in fact to make the divinity of His own\nnature manifest and to confirm the belief in His own and our resurrection, that\nHe raised up Lazarus who was destined once more to die. And the Lord became\nHimself the first-fruits of the perfect resurrection that is no longer subject\nto death Wherefore also the divine Apostle Paul said: If the dead rise not,\nthen is not Christ raised. And if Christ be not raised, our faith is vain: we\nare jet in our sins489 .\nAnd, Now, is Christ risen from the dead and become the first-fruits of them\nthat slept490 ,\nand the first-born from the dead491\n; and again, For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them\nalso which sleep in Jesus will God bring with Him492 . Even so, he said, as\nChrist rose again. Moreover, that the resurrection of the Lord was the\nunion of uncorrupted body and soul (for it was these that had been divided) is\nmanifest: for He said, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise\nit up493 .\nAnd the holy Gospel is a trustworthy witness that He spoke of His own body. Handle\nMe and see, the Lord said to His own disciples when they were thinking that\nthey saw a spirit, that it is I Myself, and that I am not changed494 : for a spirit hath not flesh\nor bones, as ye see Me have495\n.
