And let the widow mind nothing but to pray for those that give, and for the whole Church; and when she is asked anything by any one, let her not easily answer, excepting questions concerning the faith, and righteousness, and hope in God, remitting those that desire to be instructed in the doctrines of godliness to the governors. Let her only answer so as may tend to the subversion of the error of polytheism, and let her demonstrate the assertion concerning the monarchy of God.

We do not permit our \"women to teach in the Church,\"[fn-58-P5874_2097816:20-nf] but only to pray and hear those that teach; for our Master and Lord, Jesus Himself, when He sent us the twelve to make disciples of the people and of the nations, did nowhere send out women to preach, although He did not want such. For there were with us the mother of our Lord and His sisters; also Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Martha and Mary the sisters of Lazarus; Salome, and certain others. For, had it been necessary for women to teach, He Himself had first commanded these also to instruct the people with us. For \"if the head of the wife be the man,\"[fn-58-P5875_2098419:21-nf] it is not reasonable that the rest of the body should govern the head. Let the widow therefore own herself to be the \"altar of God,\" and let her sit in her house, and not enter into the houses of the faithful, under any pretence, to receive anything; for the altar of God never runs about, but is fixed in one place. Let, therefore, the virgin and the widow be such as do not run about, or gad to the houses of those who are alien from the faith. For such as these are gadders and impudent: they do not make their feet to rest in one place, because they are not widows, but purses ready to receive, triflers, evil-speakers, counsellors of strife, without shame, impudent, who being such, are not worthy of Him that called them. For they do not come to the common station of the congregation on the Lord's day,[fn-58-P5876_2099248:22-nf] as those that are watchful; but either they slumber, or trifle, or allure men, or beg, or ensnare others, bringing them to the evil one; not suffering them to be watchful in the Lord, but taking care that they go out as vain as they came in, because they do not hear the word of the Lord either taught or read. For of such as these the prophet Isaiah says: \"Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive: for the heart of this people is waxen gross,[fn-58-P5877_2099786:23-nf] and they hear heavily with their ears.\"[fn-58-P5878_2099847:24-nf] ","index":"36","references":[{"fn":"58","code":"P5874_2097816","folder":"ANF-07","text":"1 Cor. xiv. 34.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","verses":[{"chapter":14,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"58","code":"P5875_2098419","folder":"ANF-07","text":"1 Cor. xi. 3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","verses":[{"chapter":11,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"58","code":"P5876_2099248","folder":"ANF-07","text":"\"On the Lord's day\" not in one V. ms.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"58","code":"P5877_2099786","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Isa. vi. 9, 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","verses":[{"chapter":6,"verses":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]}]}]},{"fn":"58","code":"P5878_2099847","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Inserted from one V. ms.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"\nWhat are the Characters of Widows Falsely So Called.","index":"37","references":[]},{"text":"VII. In the same manner, therefore, the ears of the hearts of such widows as these are stopped, that they will not sit within in their cottages to speak to the Lord, but will run about with the design of getting, and by their foolish prattling fulfil the desires of the adversary. Such widows, therefore, are not affixed to the altar of Christ: for there are some widows which esteem gain their business; and since they ask without shame, and receive without being satisfied, render the generality more backward in giving. For when they ought to be content with their subsistence from the Church, as having moderate desires, on the contrary, they run from one of their neighbours' houses[fn-58-P5882_2100617:25-nf] to another, and disturb them, heaping up to themselves plenty of money, and lend at bitter usury, and are only solicitous about mammon, whose bag is their god; who prefer eating and drinking before all virtue, saying, \"Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die; \"[fn-58-P5883_2100959:26-nf] who esteem these things as if they were durable and not perishing things. For she that uses herself to nothing but talking of money, worships mammon instead of God,-that is, is a servant to gain, but cannot be pleasing to God, nor resigned to His worship; not being able to intercede with Him continuously on account that her mind and disposition run after money: for \"where the treasure is, there will the heart be also.\"[fn-58-P5884_2101417:27-nf] For she is thinking in her mind whither she may go to receive, or that a certain woman her friend has forgot her, and she has somewhat to say to her. She that thinks of such things as these will no longer attend to her prayers, but to that thought which offers itself; so that though sometimes she would pray for anybody, she will not be beard, because she does not offer her petition to the Lord with her whole heart, but with a divided mind. But she that will attend to God will sit within, and mind the things of the Lord day and night, offering her sincere petition with a mouth ready to utter the same without ceasing. As therefore Judith, most famous for her wisdom, and of a good report for her modesty, \"prayed to God night and day for Israel; \"[fn-58-P5885_2102190:28-nf] so also the widow who is like to her will offer her intercession without ceasing for the Church to God.

So, being grave, and giving no disturbance, she will be pleasing to God; and as soon as she asks anything, the gift will come to her: as He says, \"While thou art speaking, I will say, Behold, I am here.\"[fn-58-P5886_2102921:29-nf] Let such a one also be free from the love of money, free from arrogance, not given to filthy lucre, not insatiable, not gluttonous, but continent, meek, giving nobody disturbance, pious, modest, sitting at home, singing, and praying, and reading, and watching, and fasting; speaking to God continually in songs and hymns. And let her take wool, and rather assist others than herself want from them; being mindful of that widow who is honoured in the Gospel with the Lord's testimony, who, coming into the temple, \"cast into the treasury two mites, which make a farthing.
