And on this account assuredly the happiness of the ancient ages was changed. For, having left God, the parent and founder of all things, men began to worship the senseless works[fn-11-P1118_501141:1-nf] of their own hands. And what were the effects of this corruption, or what evils it introduced, the subject itself sufficiently declares. For, turning away from the chief good, which is blessed and everlasting on this account, because it cannot be seen,[fn-11-P1119_501424:2-nf] or touched, or comprehended, and from the virtues which are in agreement with that good, and which are equally immortal, gliding down to these corrupt and frail gods, and devoting themselves to those things by which the body only is adorned, and nourished, and delighted, they sought eternal death for themselves, together with their gods and goods relating to the body, because all bodies are subject to death. Superstitions of this kind, therefore, were followed by injustice and impiety, as must necessarily be the case. For men ceased to raise their countenances to the heaven; but, their minds being depressed downwards, clung to goods of the earth, as they did to earth-born superstitions.There followed the disagreement of mankind, and fraud, and all wickedness; because, despising eternal and incorruptible goods, which alone ought to be desired by man, they rather chose temporal and short-lived things, and greater trust was placed by men in evil, inasmuch as they preferred vice to virtue, because it had presented itself as nearer at hand.[fn-11-P1120_502647:3-nf] ","index":"35","references":[{"fn":"11","code":"P1118_501141","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Rom. i. 21-23.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":1,"verses":[21]}]},{"fn":"11","code":"P1119_501424","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Thus St. Paul, 1 Cor. ii. 9: \"Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him.\"","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":2,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"11","code":"P1120_502647","folder":"ANF-07","text":"In its rewards.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"Thus human life, which in former ages had been occupied with the clearest light, was overspread with gloom and darkness; and in conformity with this depravity, when wisdom was taken away, then at length men began to claim for themselves the name of wise. For at the time when all were wise, no one was called by that name. And would that this name, once common to all the class, though reduced to a few, still retained its power! For those few might perhaps be able, either by talent, or by authority, or by continual exhortations, to free the people from vices and errors. But so entirely had wisdom died out, that it is evident, from the very arrogance of the name, that no one of those who were so called was really wise. And yet, before the discovery of this philosophy, as it is termed, there are said to have been seven,[fn-11-P1122_503493:4-nf] who, because they ventured to inquire into and discuss natural subjects, deserved to be esteemed and called wise men.","index":"36","references":[{"fn":"11","code":"P1122_503493","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Vol. v. p. 11, supra.

So far were they removed from wisdom, that not even afterwards, when learning increased, and many and great intellects were always intent upon this very subject, could the truth be perceived and ascertained. For, after the renown of those seven wise men, it is incredible with how great a desire of inquiring into the truth all Greece was inflamed. And first of all, they thought[fn-11-P1124_504514:5-nf] the very name of wisdom arrogant, and did not call themselves wise men, but desirous of wisdom. By which deed they both condemned those who had rashly arrogated to themselves the name of wise men, of error and folly, and themselves also of ignorance, which indeed they did not deny. For wherever the nature of the subject had, as it were, laid its hands upon their minds, so that they were unable to give any account, they were accustomed to testify that, they knew nothing, and discerned nothing.

But what can we suppose to have been the reason why it was not found, though sought with the greatest earnestness and labour by so many intellects, and during so many ages, unless it be that philosophers sought for it out of their own limits? And since they traversed and explored all parts, but nowhere found any wisdom, and it must of necessity be somewhere, it is evident that it ought especially to be sought there where the title of folly[fn-11-P1128_505968:6-nf] appears; under the covering of which God hides the treasury of wisdom and truth, lest the secret of His divine work should be exposed to view.[fn-11-P1129_506135:7-nf] Whence I am accustomed to wonder that, when Pythagoras, and after him Plato, inflamed with the love of searching out the truth, had penetrated as far as to the Egyptians, and Magi, and Persians, that they might become acquainted with their religious rites and institutions (for they suspected that wisdom was concerned with religion), they did not approach the Jews only, in whose possession alone it then was, and to whom they might have gone more easily. But I think that they were turned away from them by divine providence, that they might not know the truth, because it was not yet permitted for the religion of the true God and righteousness to become known to men of other nations.[fn-11-P1130_506930:8-nf] For God had determined, as the last time drew near,[fn-11-P1131_507178:9-nf] to send from heaven a great leader,[fn-11-P1132_507299:10-nf] who should reveal to foreign nations that which was taken away from a perfidious[fn-11-P1133_507470:11-nf] and ungrateful people.

And therefore that is not to be deemed true religion, because it instructs and improves men by no precepts of righteousness and virtue. Thus philosophy, inasmuch as it does not possess true religion, that is, the highest piety, is not true wisdom. For if the divinity which governs this world supports mankind with incredible beneficence, and cherishes it as with paternal indulgence, wishes truly that gratitude should be paid, and honour given to itself, man cannot preserve his piety if he shall prove ungrateful for the heavenly benefits; and this is certainly not the part of a wise man. Since, therefore, as I have said, philosophy and the religious system of the gods are separated, and far removed from each other; seeing that some are professors of wisdom, through whom it is manifest that there is no approach to the gods, and that others are priests of religion, through whom wisdom is not learned; it is manifest that the one is not true wisdom, and that the other is not true religion. Therefore I philosophy was not able to conceive the truth, nor was the religious system of the gods able to give an account of itself, since it is without it. But where wisdom is joined by an inseparable connection with religion, both must necessarily be true; because in our worship we ought to be wise, that is, to know the proper object and mode of worship, and in our wisdom to worship, that is, to complete our knowledge by deed and action.","index":"41","references":[]},{"text":"Where, then, is wisdom joined with religion? There, indeed, where the one God is worshipped, where life and every action is referred to one source, and to one supreme authority: in short, the teachers of wisdom are the same, who are also the priests of God.[fn-11-P1138_509968:12-nf] Nor, however, let it affect any one, because it often has happened, and may happen, that some philosopher may undertake a priesthood of the gods; and when this happens, philosophy is not, however, joined with religion; but philosophy will both be unemployed amidst sacred rites, and religion will be unemployed when philosophy shall be treated of. For that system of religious rites is dumb, not only because it relates to gods who are dumb, but also because its observance is by the hand and the fingers, not by the heart and tongue, as is the case with ours, which is true. Therefore religion is contained in wisdom, and wisdom in religion. The one, then, cannot be separated from the other; because wisdom is nothing else but the worship of the true God with just and pious adoration. But that the worship of many gods is not in accordance with nature, may be inferred and conceived even by this argument: that every god who is worshipped by man must, amidst the solemn rites and prayers, be invoked as father, not only for the sake of honour, but also of reason; because he is both more ancient than man, and because he affords life, safety, and sustenance, as a father does. Therefore Jupiter is called father by those who pray to him, as is Saturnus, and Janus, and Liber, and the rest in order; which Lucilius[fn-11-P1139_511346:13-nf] laughs at in the council of the gods: \"So that there is none of us who is not called excellent father of the gods; so that father Neptunus, Liber, father Saturnus, Mars, Janus, father Quirinus, are called after one name.\" But if nature does not permit that one man should have many fathers (for he is produced from one only), therefore the worship of many gods is contrary to nature, and contrary to piety.","index":"42","references":[{"fn":"11","code":"P1138_509968","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Iidem sunt doctores sapientiae qui et De. sacerdotes.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"11","code":"P1139_511346","folder":"ANF-07","text":"The satirist, not Cicero's friend; Nat.

He also must of necessity be Lord, because as He has power to indulge, so also has He power to restrain. He is to be called Father on this account, because He bestows upon us many and great things; and Lord on this account, because He has the greatest power of chastising and punishing. But that He who is Father is also Lord, is shown even by reference to civil law.[fn-11-P1141_512253:14-nf] For who will be able to bring up sons, unless he has the power of a lord over them? Nor without reason is he called father of a household,[fn-11-P1142_512546:15-nf] although he only has sons: for it is plain that the name of father embraces also slaves, because \"household\" follows; and the name of \"household\" comprises also sons, because the name of \"father\" precedes: from which it is evident, that the same person is both father of his slaves[fn-11-P1143_512963:16-nf] and lord of his sons. Lastly, the son is set at liberty as if he were a slave; and the liberated slave receives the name[fn-11-P1144_513292:17-nf] of his patron, as if he were a son. But if a man is named father of a household, that it may appear that he is possessed of a double power, because as a father he ought to indulge, and as a lord to restrain, it follows that he who is a son is also a slave, and that he who is a father is also a lord. As, therefore, by the necessity of nature, there cannot be more than one father, so there can only be one lord. For what will the slave do if many lords[fn-11-P1145_513994:18-nf] shall give commands at variance with each other? Therefore the worship of many gods is contrary to reason and to nature, since there cannot be many fathers or lords; but it is necessary to consider the gods both as fathers and lords.","index":"43","references":[{"fn":"11","code":"P1141_512253","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Fathers in ancient times had the greatest power over their children, so that they had the right of life and death, as masters had over their slaves.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"11","code":"P1142_512546","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Pater familias-a title given to the master of a household, whether he had sons or not; the slaves of a house were called familia.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"11","code":"P1143_512963","folder":"ANF-07","text":"It has been judged better to keep the words \"slave\" and \"lord\" throughout the passage, for the sake of uniformity of expression, though in some places \"servant\" and \"master\" might seem more appropriate.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"11","code":"P1144_513292","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Among the Romans slaves had no praenomen or distinguishing name; when a slave was set at liberty, he was allowed to assume the name of his master as a praenomen.

For when a woman is destitute of modesty, chastity, and fidelity, she must of necessity be without virtue.

Wisdom relates to sons, and this relation requires love; religion to servants, and this relation requires fear.

But with respect to God, who is one only, inasmuch as He sustains the twofold character both of Father and Lord, we are bound both to love Him, inasmuch as we are sons, and to fear Him, inasmuch as we are servants.[fn-11-P1150_515653:19-nf] Religion, therefore, cannot be divided from wisdom, nor can wisdom be separated from religion; because it is the same God, who ought to be understood, which is the part of wisdom, and to be honoured, which is the part of religion. But wisdom precedes, religion follows; for the knowledge of God comes first, His worship is the result of knowledge. Thus in the two names there is but one meaning, though it seems to be different in each case. For the one is concerned with the understanding, the other with action. But, however, they resemble two streams flowing from one fountain.

And as they who are disinherited do not attain to the inheritance of their father, nor runaway slaves impunity, so neither will philosophers receive immortality, which is the inheritance of the heavenly kingdom, that is, the chief good, which they especially seek; nor will the worshippers of gods escape the penalty of everlasting death, which is the punishment of the true Master against those who are deserters[fn-11-P1152_517300:20-nf] of His majesty and name. But that God is Father and also Lord was unknown to both, to the worshippers of the gods as well as to the professors of wisdom themselves: inasmuch as they either thought that nothing at all was to be worshipped; or they approved of false religions or, although they understood the strength and power of the Supreme God (as Plato, who says that there is one God, Creator of the world, and Marcus Tullius, who acknowledges that man has been produced by the Supreme God in an excellent condition), nevertheless they did not render the worship due to Him as to the supreme Father, which was their befitting and necessary duty. But that the gods cannot be fathers or lords, is declared not only by their multitude, as I have shown above,[fn-11-P1153_518134:21-nf] but also by reason: because it is not reported that man was made by gods, nor is it found that the gods themselves preceded the origin of man, since it appears that there were men on the earth before the birth of Vulcan, and Liber, and Apollo, and Jupiter himself.

Our spirits[fn-12-P1208_534092:52-nf] are liable to dissolution, because we are mortal: but the spirits of God both live, and are lasting, and have perception; because He Himself is immortal, and the Giver both of perception[fn-12-P1209_534394:53-nf] and life.

Solomon also shows that it is the Word of God, and no other,[fn-12-P1213_535847:57-nf] by whose hands these works of the world were made. \"I,\" He says, \"came forth out of the mouth of the Most High before all creatures: I caused the light that faileth not to arise in the heavens, and covered the whole earth with a cloud.

But He commanded His own Son, the first-begotten,[fn-12-P1258_548912:90-nf] the maker of all things, His own counsellor, to descend from heaven, that He might transfer the sacred religion of God to the Gentiles,[fn-12-P1259_549124:91-nf] that is, to those who were ignorant of God, and might teach them righteousness, which the perfidious people had cast aside· And He had long before threatened that He would do this, as the prophet Malachi[fn-12-P1260_549346:92-nf] shows, saying: \"I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord, and I will not accept an offering from your hands; for from the rising of the sun even unto its setting, my name shall be great[fn-12-P1261_549554:93-nf] among the Gentiles.\" David also in the seventeenth Psalm[fn-12-P1262_549669:94-nf] says: \"Thou wilt make me the head of the heathen; a people whom I have not known shall serve me\" Isaiah[fn-12-P1263_549885:95-nf] also thus speaks: \"I come to gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come and see my glory; and I will send among them a sign, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations which are afar off, which have not heard my fame; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.\" Therefore, when God wished to send to the earth one who should measure[fn-12-P1264_550327:96-nf] His temple, He was unwilling to send him with heavenly power and glory, that the people who had been ungrateful towards God might be led into the greatest error, and suffer punishment for their crimes, since they had not received their Lord and God, as the prophets had before foretold that it would thus happen.

But if it is known to all that certain animals are accustomed to conceive[fn-12-P1279_553932:107-nf] by the wind and the breeze, why should any one think it wonderful when we say that a virgin was made fruitful by the Spirit of God, to whom whatever He may wish is easy? And this might have appeared incredible, had not the prophets many ages previously foretold its occurrence. Thus Solomon speaks:[fn-12-P1280_554415:108-nf] \"The womb of a virgin was strengthened, and conceived; and a virgin was made fruitful, and became a mother in great pity.\" Likewise the prophet Isaiah,[fn-12-P1281_554760:109-nf] whose words are these: \"Therefore God Himself shall give you a sign: Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son; and ye shall call His name Emmanuel.\" What can be more manifest than this? This was read by the Jews, who denied Him. If any one thinks that these things are invented by us, let him inquire of them, let him take especially from them: the testimony is sufficiently strong to prove the truth, when it is alleged by enemies themselves, But He was never called Emmanuel, but Jesus, who in Latin is called Saving, or Saviour,[fn-12-P1282_555320:110-nf] because He comes bringing salvation to all nations. But by this name the prophet declared that God incarnate was about to come to men. For Emmanuel signifies God with us; because when He was born of a virgin, men ought to confess that God was with them, that is, on the earth and in mortal flesh. Whence David[fn-12-P1283_555663:111-nf] says in the eighty-fourth Psalm, \"Truth has sprung out of the earth; \"because God, in whom is truth, hath taken a body of earth, that He might open a way of salvation to those of the earth. In like manner Isaiah also:[fn-12-P1284_555932:112-nf] \"But they disbelieved, and vexed His Holy Spirit; and He was turned to be their enemy. And He Himself fought against them, and He remembered the days of old,[fn-12-P1285_556114:113-nf] who raised up from the earth a shepherd of the sheep.\" But who this shepherd was about to be, he declared in another place,[fn-12-P1286_556419:114-nf] saying: \"Let the heavens rejoice, and let the clouds put on righteousness; let the earth open, and put forth a Saviour. For I the Lord have begotten Him.\" But the Saviour is, as we have said before, Jesus. But in another place the same prophet also thus proclaimed:[fn-12-P1287_556733:115-nf] \"Behold, unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given, whose dominion is upon His shoulders, and His name is called Messenger of great counsel.\" For on this account He was sent by God the Father, that He might reveal to all the nations which are under heaven the sacred mystery of the only true God, which was taken away from the perfidious people, who ofttimes sinned against God. Daniel also foretold similar things:[fn-12-P1288_557195:116-nf] \"I saw,\" he said, \"in a vision of the night, and, behold, one like the Son of man coming with the clouds of heaven, and He came even to the Ancient of days. And they who stood by brought Him near[fn-12-P1289_557416:117-nf] before Him. And there was given unto Him a kingdom, and glory, and dominion; and all people, tribes, and languages shall serve Him: and His dominion is everlasting, which shall never pass away, and His kingdom shall not be destroyed.\" How then do the Jews both confess and expect the Christ of God? who rejected Him on this account, because He was born of man. For since it is so arranged by God that the same Christ should twice come to the earth, once to announce to the nations the one God, then again to reign, why do they who did not believe in His first advent believe in the second?","index":"79","references":[{"fn":"12","code":"P1277_553651","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Se insinuaret.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"12","code":"P1278_553715","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Divino spiritu hausto.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"12","code":"P1279_553932","folder":"ANF-07","text":"So Virgil, Georgic iii. 274:-","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"12","code":"P1280_554415","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Possibly from some copy (North African) of the \"Book of Wisdom,\" interpolated from a marginal comment.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"12","code":"P1281_554760","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Isa. vii. 14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":7,"verses":[14]}]},{"fn":"12","code":"P1282_555320","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Salutaris, sive Salvator.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"12","code":"P1283_555663","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Ps. lxxxv. 12, quoted from the Septuagint.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":85,"verses":[12]}]},{"fn":"12","code":"P1284_555932","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Isa. lxiii. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":63,"verses":[10]}]},{"fn":"12","code":"P1285_556114","folder":"ANF-07","text":"The days of the age.

He called the Most High God the Ancient of days, whose age and origin cannot be comprehended; for He alone was from generations, and He will be always to generations.[fn-12-P1294_559160:121-nf] But that Christ, after His passion and resurrection, was about to ascend to God the Father, David bore witness in these words in the cixth Psalm:[fn-12-P1295_559324:122-nf] \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\" Whom could this prophet, being himself a king, call his Lord, who sat at the right hand of God, but Christ the Son of God, who is King of kings and Lord of lords? And this is more plainly shown by Isaiah,[fn-12-P1296_559646:123-nf] when he says: \"Thus saith the Lord God to my Lord Christ, whose right hand I have holden; I will subdue nations before Him, and will break the strength of kings. I will open before Him gates, and the cities shall not be closed. I will go before Thee, and will make the mountains level; and I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and shatter the bars of iron; and I will give Thee the hidden and invisible treasures, that Thou mayest know that I am the Lord God, which call Thee by Thy name, the God of Israel.\" Lastly, on account of the goodness and faithfulness which He displayed towards God on earth, there was given to Him a kingdom, and glory, and dominion; and all people, tribes, and languages shall serve Him; and His dominion is everlasting, and that which shall never pass away, and His kingdom shall not be destroyed. And this is understood in two ways: that even now He has an everlasting dominion, when all nations and all languages adore His name, confess His majesty, follow His teaching, and imitate His goodness: He has power and glory, in that all tribes of the earth obey His precepts. And also, when He shall come again with majesty and glory to judge every soul, and to restore the righteous to life, then He shall truly have the government of the whole earth: then, every evil having been removed from the affairs of men, a golden age (as the poets call it), that is, a time of righteousness and peace, will arise.

Nevertheless it was His pleasure that He should be born as a man, that in all things He might be like His supreme Father· For God the Father Himself, who is the origin and source of all things, inasmuch as He is without parents, is most truly named by Trismegistus \"fatherless\" and \"motherless,\"[fn-13-P1301_562201:125-nf] because He was born from no one. For which reason it was befitting that the Son also should be twice born, that He also might become \"fatherless\" and \"motherless.\" For in His first nativity, which was spiritual, He was \"motherless,\" because He was begotten by God the Father alone, without the office of a mother. But in His second, which was in the flesh, He was born of a virgin's womb without the office of a father, that, bearing a middle substance between God and man, He might be able, as it were, to take by the hand this frail and weak nature of ours, and raise it to immortality. He became both the Son of God through the Spirit, and the Son of man through the flesh,-that is, both God and man. The power of God was displayed in Him, from the works which He performed; the frailty of the man, from the passion which He endured: on what account He undertook it I will mention a little later. In the meantime, we learn from the predictions of the prophets that He was both God and man-composed[fn-13-P1302_563288:126-nf] of both natures. Isaiah testifies that He was God in these words:[fn-13-P1303_563787:127-nf] \"Egypt is wearied,[fn-13-P1304_563830:128-nf] and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and the Sabaeans, men of stature, shall come over unto Thee, and shall be Thy servants: and they shall walk behind Thee; in chains they shall fall down unto Thee, and shall make supplication unto Thee, Since God is in Thee, and there is no other God besides Thee. For Thou art God, and we knew Thee not, the God of Israel, the Savour. They shall all be confounded and ashamed who oppose Thee, and shall fall into confusion.\" In like manner the prophet Jeremiah[fn-13-P1305_564389:129-nf] thus speaks: \"This is our God, and there shall none other be compared unto Him. He hath found out all the way of knowledge, and hath given it unto Jacob His servant, and to Israel His beloved. Afterward He was seen upon earth, and dwelt among men.\"David also, in the forty-fourth Psalm:[fn-13-P1306_564809:130-nf] \"Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of Thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness; therefore God, Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness.\" By which word he also shows His name, since (as I have shown above) He was called Christ from His anointing. Then, that He was also man, Jeremiah teaches, saying:[fn-13-P1307_565217:131-nf] \"And He is a man, and who hath known Him? \"Also Isaiah:[fn-13-P1308_565337:132-nf] \"And God shall send to them a man, who shall save them, shall save them by judging.\" But Moses also, in Numbers,[fn-13-P1309_565499:133-nf] thus speaks: \"There shall arise a star out of Jacob, and a man[fn-13-P1310_565761:134-nf] shall spring forth from Israel.\" On which account the Milesian Apollo,[fn-13-P1311_565970:135-nf] being asked whether He was God or man, replied in this manner: \"He was mortal as to His body, being wise with wondrous works; but being taken with arms under Chaldean judges, with nails and the cross He endured a bitter end.\" In the first verse he spoke the truth, but he skilfully deceived him who asked the question, who was entirely ignorant of the mystery of the truth. For he appears to have denied that He was God. But when he acknowledges that He was mortal as to the flesh, which we also declare, it follows that as to the spirit He was God, which we affirm. For why would it have been necessary to make mention of the flesh, since it was sufficient to say that He was mortal?

If he is wise, then his system of instruction is wisdom, and no other; and they are wise who follow it, and no others. Why then are we commonly esteemed as foolish, and visionary, and senseless, who follow a Master who is wise even by the confession of the gods themselves? For in that he said that He wrought wonderful deeds, by which He especially claimed faith is His divinity, he now appears to assent to us, when he says the same things in which we boast. But, however, he recovers himself, and again has recourse to demoniacal frauds. For when he had been compelled to speak the truth, he now appeared to be a betrayer of the gods and of himself, unless he had, by a deceptive falsehood, concealed that which the truth had extorted from him. He says, therefore, that He did indeed perform wonderful works, yet not by divine power, but by magic. What wonder if Apollo thus persuaded men ignorant of the truth, when the Jews also, worshippers (as they seemed to be) of the Most High God, entertained the same opinion, though they had every day before their eyes those miracles which the prophets had foretold to them as about to happen, and yet they could not be induced by the contemplation of such powers to believe that He whom they saw was God? On this account, David, whom they especially read above the other prophets, in the twenty-seventh Psalm[fn-13-P1313_568350:136-nf] thus condemns them: \"Render to them their desert, because they regard not the works of the Lord.\" Both David himself and other prophets announced that of the house of this very David, Christ should be born according to the flesh. Thus it is written in Isaiah:[fn-13-P1314_568635:137-nf] \"And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, and He who shall arise to rule over the nations, in Him shall the Gentiles trust; and His rest shall be glorious.\" And in another place:[fn-13-P1315_568841:138-nf] \"There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a blossom[fn-13-P1316_568933:139-nf] shall grow out of his root; and the Spirit of God shall rest upon Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and of might, the spirit of knowledge and ofpiety; and He shall be filled[fn-13-P1317_569189:140-nf] with the spirit of fear of the Lord.\" Now Jesse was the father of David, from whose root he foretold that a blossom would arise; namely him of whom the Sibyl speaks, \"A pure blossom shall spring forth.\"","index":"83","references":[{"fn":"13","code":"P1313_568350","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Ps. xxviii. 4, 5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":28,"verses":[4]}]},{"fn":"13","code":"P1314_568635","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Isa. xi. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":11,"verses":[10]}]},{"fn":"13","code":"P1315_568841","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Isa. xi. 1, 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":11,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"13","code":"P1316_568933","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Flos.

He shall build me a house for my name, and I will set up His throne for ever; and I will be to Him for a father, and He shall be to me for a son; and His house shall be established,[fn-13-P1320_570070:142-nf] and His kingdom for ever.\" But the reason why the Jews did not understand these things was this, because Solomon the son of David built a temple for God, and the city which he called from his own name, Jerusalem.[fn-13-P1321_570349:143-nf] Therefore they referred the predictions of the prophets to him. Now Solomon received the government of the kingdom from his father himself. But the prophets spoke of Him who was then born after that David had slept with his fathers. Besides, the reign of Solomon was not everlasting; for he reigned forty years. In the next place, Solomon was never called the son of God, but the son of David; and the house which he built was not firmly established,[fn-13-P1322_571099:144-nf] as the Church, which is the true temple of God, which does not consist of walls, but of the heart[fn-13-P1323_571239:145-nf] and faith of the men who believe on Him, and are called faithful. But that temple of Solomon, inasmuch as it was built by the hand, fell by the hand. Lastly, his father, in the cxxvith Psalm, prophesied in this manner respecting the works of his son:[fn-13-P1324_571566:146-nf] \"Except the Lord build the house, they have laboured in vain that built it; except the Lord keep the city, the watchman hath waked but in vain.\"","index":"84","references":[{"fn":"13","code":"P1319_569596","folder":"ANF-07","text":"2 Sam. vii. 4, 5, 12-14, 16..","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 samuel","chapter":7,"verses":[4]}]},{"fn":"13","code":"P1320_570070","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Fidem consequetur, following the Septuagint pistwqh/setai.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"13","code":"P1321_570349","folder":"ANF-07","text":"See vol. ii. p. 107, note 3, this series.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"13","code":"P1322_571099","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Non est fidem consecuta, as above.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"13","code":"P1323_571239","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Thus Peter speaks, 1 Ep. ii. 5, \"Ye are built up a spiritual house.\"","bible_refs":[{"book":"ephesians","chapter":2,"verses":[5]}]},{"fn":"13","code":"P1324_571566","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Ps. cxxvii. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":127,"verses":[1]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter XIV.-Of the Priesthood of Jesus Foretold by the Prophets.","index":16,"paragraphs":[{"text":"From which things it is evident that all the prophets declared concerning Christ, that it should come to pass at some time, that being born with a body[fn-13-P1328_571949:147-nf] of the race of David, He should build an eternal temple in honour of God, which is called the Church, and assemble all nations to the true worship of God. This is the faithful house, this is the everlasting temple; and if any one hath not sacrificed in this, he will not have the reward of immortality. And since Christ was the builder of this great and eternal temple, He must also have an everlasting priesthood in it; and there can be no approach to the shrine of the temple, and to the sight of God, except through Him who built the temple. David in the cixth Psalm teaches the same, saying:[fn-13-P1329_572566:148-nf] \"Before the morning-star I begat Thee. The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent; Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec.\"Also in the first book of Kings:[fn-13-P1330_572836:149-nf] \"And I will raise me up a faithful Priest, who shall do all things that are in mine heart; and I will build him a sure[fn-13-P1331_572977:150-nf] house; and he shall walk in my sight[fn-13-P1332_573055:151-nf] all his days.\" But who this was about to be, to whom God promised an everlasting priesthood, Zechariah most plainly teaches, even mentioning His name:[fn-13-P1333_573332:152-nf] \"And the Lord God showed me Jesus[fn-13-P1334_573390:153-nf] the great Priest standing before the face of the angel of the Lord, and the adversary[fn-13-P1335_573617:154-nf] was standing at His right hand to resist Him.

But from the time in which Zechariah lived, until the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, in which Christ was crucified, nearly five hundred years are reckoned; since he flourished in the time of Darius and Alexander,[fn-13-P1339_575189:157-nf] who lived not long after the banishment of Tarquinius Superbus. But they were again misled and deceived in the same manner, in supposing that these things were spoken concerning Jesus[fn-13-P1340_575442:158-nf] the son of Nave, who was the successor of Moses, or concerning Jesus the high priest the son of Josedech; to whom none of those things which the prophet related was suited. For they were never clothed in filthy garments, since one of them was a most powerful prince, and the other high priest; or suffered any adversity, so that they should be regarded as a brand plucked from the fire: not did they ever stand in the presence of God and the angels; nor did the prophet speak of the past so much as of the future. He spoke, therefore, of Jesus the Son of God, to show that He would first come in humility and in the flesh. For this is the filthy garment, that He might prepare a temple for God, and might be scorched[fn-13-P1341_576253:159-nf] as a brand with fire-that is, might endure tortures from men, and at last be extinguished. For a haft-burnt brand drawn forth from the hearth and extinguished, is commonly so called,[fn-13-P1342_576689:160-nf] But in what manner and with what commands He was sent by God to the earth, the Spirit of God declared through the prophet, teaching us that when He had faithfully and uniformly fulfilled the will of His supreme Father, He should receive judgment[fn-13-P1343_576993:161-nf] and an everlasting dominion. If, He says, Thou wilt walk in my ways, and keep my precepts, then Thou shalt judge my house. What these ways of God were, and what His precepts, is neither doubtful nor obscure. For God, when He saw that wickedness and the worship of false gods had so prevailed throughout the world, that His name had now also been taken away from the memory of men (since even the Jews, who alone had been entrusted with the secret of God, had deserted the living God, and, ensared by the deceits of demons, had gone astray, and turned aside to the worship of images, and when rebuked by the prophets did not choose to return to God), He sent His Son[fn-13-P1344_577723:162-nf] as an ambassador to men, that He might turn them from their impious and vain worship to the knowledge and worship of the true God; and also that He might turn their minds from foolishness to wisdom, and from wickedness to deeds of righteousness. These are the ways of God, in which He enjoined Him to walk. These are the precepts which He ordered to be observed. But He exhibited faith towards God. For He taught that there is but one God, and that He alone ought to be worshipped. Nor did He at any time say that He Himself was God; for He would not have maintained His faithfulness, if, when sent to abolish the false gods, and to assert the existence of the one God, He had introduced another besides that one. This would have been not to proclaim one God, nor to do the work of Him who sent Him, but to discharge a peculiar office for Himself, and to separate Himself from Him whom He came to reveal. On which account, because He was so faithful, because He arrogated nothing at all to Himself, that He might fulfil the commands of Him who sent Him, He received the dignity of everlasting Priest, and the honour of supreme King, and the authority of Judge, and the name of God.","index":"87","references":[{"fn":"13","code":"P1339_575189","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Not the Great, but the tenth, a much earlier king of Macedon.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"13","code":"P1340_575442","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Justin vol. i. pp. 174, 266.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"13","code":"P1341_576253","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Ambureretur.

Circumcise yourselves to the Lord your God, and take away the foreskins of your heart, lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it.\" Also Moses himself says:[fn-14-P1443_600547:226-nf] \"In the last days the Lord shall circumcise thine heart to love the Lord thy God.\" Also Jesus[fn-14-P1444_600662:227-nf] the son of Nun, his successor, said: \"And the Lord said unto Jesus, Make thee knives of flint very sharp, and sit and circumcise the children of Israel the second time.\" He said that this second circumcision would be not of the flesh, as the first was, which the Jews practise even now, but of the heart and spirit, which was delivered by Christ, who was the true Jesus. For the prophet does not say, \"And the Lord said unto me,\" but \"unto Jesus,\" that he might show that God was not speaking of him, but of Christ, to whom God was then speaking. For that Jesus represented[fn-14-P1445_601273:228-nf] Christ: for when he was at first called Auses,[fn-14-P1446_601385:229-nf] Moses, foreseeing the future, ordered that he should be called Jesus; that since he had been chosen as the leader of the warfare against Amalek, who was the enemy of the children of Israel, he might both subdue the adversary by the emblem[fn-14-P1447_601953:230-nf] of the name, and lead the people into the land of promise. And for this reason he was also successor to Moses, to show that the new law given by Christ Jesus was about to succeed to the old law which was given by Moses. For that circumcision of the flesh is plainly irrational; since, if God had so willed it, He might so have formed man from the beginning, that he should be without a foreskin. But it was a figure of this second circumcision, signifying that the breast is to be laid bare; that is, that we ought to live with an open and simple heart, since that part of the body which is circumcised has a kind of resemblance to the heart, and is to be treated with reverence. On this account God ordered that it should be laid bare, that by this argument He might admonish us not to have our breast hidden[fn-14-P1448_602929:231-nf] in obscurity; that is, not to veil any shameful deed within the secrets of conscience. This is the circumcision of the heart of which the prophets speak, which God transferred from the mortal flesh to the soul, which alone is about to endure. For being desirous of promoting our life and salvation in accordance with His own goodness, in that circumcision He hath set before us repentance, that if we lay open our hearts,-that is if we confess our sins and make satisfaction to God,-we shall obtain pardon, which is denied to those who are obstinate and conceal their faults, by Him who regards not the outward appearance, as man does, but the innermost secrets of the heart.[fn-14-P1449_603727:232-nf] ","index":"119","references":[{"fn":"14","code":"P1442_600123","folder":"ANF-07","text":"The quotation is not from Isaiah, but from Jer iv. 3, 4.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1443_600547","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Deut. xxx. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"deuteronomy","chapter":30,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1444_600662","folder":"ANF-07","text":"i.e., Joshua.

I do not as yet speak of Him whom they deny to have come from God. Let us suppose that some one were to be sent from heaven to instruct the life of men in the first principles of virtue, and to form them to righteousness. No one can doubt but that this teacher, who is sent from heaven, would be as perfect in the knowledge of all things as in virtue, lest there should be no difference between a heavenly and an earthly teacher. For in the case of a man his instruction can by no means be from within and of himself.[fn-15-P1582_639059:323-nf] For the mind, shut in by earthly organs, and hindered by a corrupt[fn-15-P1583_639142:324-nf] body, of itself can neither comprehend nor receive the truth, unless it is taught from another source.[fn-15-P1584_639267:325-nf] And if it had this power in the greatest degree, yet it would be unable to attain to the highest virtue, and to resist all vices, the materials of which are contained in our bodily[fn-15-P1585_639530:326-nf] organs. Hence it comes to pass, that an earthly teacher cannot be perfect. But a teacher from heaven, to whom His divine nature gives knowledge, and His immortality gives virtue, must of necessity in His teaching also, as in other things, be perfect and complete. But this cannot by any means happen, unless He should take to Himself a mortal body. And the reason why it cannot happen is manifest. For if He should come to men as God, not to mention that mortal eyes cannot look upon and endure the glory of His majesty in His own person, assuredly God will not be able to teach virtue; for, inasmuch as He is without a body, He will not practise the things which He will teach, and through this His teaching will not be perfect. Otherwise, if it is the greatest virtue patiently to endure pain for the sake of righteousness and duty, if it is virtue not to fear death itself when threatened, and when inflicted to undergo it with fortitude; it follows that the perfect teacher ought both to teach these things by precept, and to confirm them by practice. For he who gives precepts for the life, ought to remove every method[fn-15-P1586_640674:327-nf] of excuse, that he may impose upon men the necessity of obedience, not by any constraint, but by a sense of shame, and yet may leave them liberty, that a reward may be appointed for those who obey, because it was in their power not to obey if they so wished; and a punishment for those who do not obey, because it was in their power to obey if they so wished. How then can excuse be removed, unless the teacher should practise what he teaches, and as it were go before[fn-15-P1587_641295:328-nf] and hold out his hand to one who is about to follow? But how can one practise what he teaches, unless he is like him whom he teaches? For if he be subject to no passion, a man may thus answer him who is the teacher: It is my wish not to sin, but I am overpowered; for I am clothed with frail and weak flesh: it is this which covets, which is angry, which fears pain and death. And thus I am led on against my will;[fn-15-P1588_641727:329-nf] and I sin, not because it is my wish, but because I am compelled. I myself perceive that I sin; but the necessity imposed by my frailty, which I am unable to resist, impels me. What will that teacher of righteousness say in reply to these things? How will he refute and convict a man who shall allege the frailty of the flesh as an excuse for his faults, unless he himself also shall be clothed with flesh, so that he may show that even the flesh is capable of virtue? For obstinacy cannot be refuted except by example. For the things which you teach cannot have any weight unless you shall be the first to practise them; because the nature of men is inclined to faults, and wishes to sin not only with indulgence, but also with a reasonable plea.[fn-15-P1589_642842:330-nf] It is befitting that a master and teacher of virtue should most closely resemble man, that by overpowering sin he may teach man that sin may be overpowered by him. But if he is immortal, he can by no means propose an example to man. For there will stand forth some one persevering in his opinion, and will say: You indeed do not sin, because you are free from this body; you do not covet, because nothing is needed by an immortal; but I have need of many things for the support of this life. You do not fear death, because it can have no power against you. You despise pain, because you can suffer no violence. But I, a mortal, fear both, because they bring upon me the severest tortures, which the weakness of the flesh cannot endure. A teacher of virtue therefore ought to have taken away this excuse from men, that no one may ascribe it to necessity that he sins, rather than to his own fault. Therefore, that a teacher may be perfect, no objection ought to be brought forward by him who is to be taught, so that if he should happen to say, You enjoin impossibilities; the teacher may answer, See, I myself do them. But I am clothed with flesh, and it is the property of flesh to sin.[fn-15-P1590_644051:331-nf] I too bear the same flesh, and yet sin does not bear rule in me. It is difficult for me to despise riches, because otherwise I am unable to live in this body. See, I too have a body, and yet I contend against every desire. I am not able to bear pain or death for righteousness, because I am frail. See, pain and death have power over me also; and I overcome those very things which you fear, that I may make you victorious over pain and death. I go before you through those things which you allege that it is impossible to endure: if you are not able to follow me giving directions, follow me going before you. In this way all excuse is taken away, and you must confess that man is unjust through his own fault, since he does not follow a teacher of virtue, who is at the same time a guide. You see, therefore, how much more perfect is a teacher who is mortal, because he is able to be a guide to one who is mortal, than one who is immortal, for he is unable to teach patient endurance who is not subject to passions. Nor, however, does this extend so far that I prefer man to God; but to show that man cannot be a perfect teacher unless he is also God, that he may by his heavenly authority impose upon men the necessity of obedience; nor God, unless he is clothed with a mortal body, that by carrying out his precepts to their completion[fn-15-P1591_645558:332-nf] in actions, he may bind others by the necessity of obedience. It plainly therefore appears, that he who is a guide of life and teacher of righteousness must have a body, and that his teaching cannot otherwise be full and perfect, unless it has a root and foundation, and remains firm and fixed among men; and that he himself must undergo weakness of flesh and body, and display in himself[fn-15-P1592_645987:333-nf] the virtue of which he is a teacher, that he may teach it at the same time both by words and deeds. Also, he must be subject to death and all sufferings, since the duties of virtue are occupied with the enduring of suffering, and the undergoing death; all which, as I have said, a perfect teacher ought to endure, that he may teach the possibility of their being endured.","index":"154","references":[{"fn":"15","code":"P1582_639059","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Propria.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"15","code":"P1583_639142","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Tabe corporis.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"15","code":"P1584_639267","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Thus our Lord tells us that flesh and blood cannot reveal to us mysteries.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"15","code":"P1585_639530","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Visceribus.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"15","code":"P1586_640674","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Here is the defect of Cicero's philosophy.

For God (as I have before explained), when He had determined to set man free, sent as His ambassador to the earth a teacher of virtue, who might both by salutary precepts train men to innocence, and by works and deeds before their eyes[fn-16-P1623_657825:354-nf] might open the way of righteousness, by walking in which, and following his teacher, man might attain to eternal life. He therefore assumed a body, and was clothed in a garment of flesh, that He might hold out to man, for whose instruction He had come, examples of virtue and incitements to its practice. But when He had afforded an example of righteousness in all the duties of life, in order that He might teach man also the patient endurance of pain and contempt of death, by which virtue is rendered perfect and complete, He came into the hands of an impious nation, when, by the knowledge of the future which He had, He might have avoided them, and by the same power by which He did wonderful works He might have repelled them. Therefore He endured tortures, and stripes, and thorns. At last He did not refuse even to undergo death, that under His guidance man might triumph over death, subdued and bound in chains with all its terrors. But the reason why the Most High Father chose that kind of death in preference to others, with which He should permit Him to be visited, is this. For some one may perchance say: Why, if He was God, and chose to die, did He not at least suffer by some honourable kind of death? why was it by the cross especially? why by an infamous kind of punishment, which may appear unworthy even of a man if he is free,[fn-16-P1624_659195:355-nf] although guilty? First of all, because He, who had come in humility that He might bring assistance to the humble and men of low degree, and might hold out to all the hope of safety, was to suffer by that kind of punishment by which the humble and low usually suffer, that there might be no one at all who might not be able to imitate Him.

Therefore, because He had laid down His life while fastened to the cross, His executioners did not think it necessary to break His bones (as was their prevailing custom), but they only pierced His side. Thus His unbroken body was taken down from the cross, and carefully enclosed in a tomb. Now all these things were done lest His body, being injured and broken, should be rendered unsuitable[fn-16-P1627_660330:357-nf] for rising again. That also was a principal cause why God chose the cross, because it was necessary that He should be lifted up on it, and the passion of God become known to all nations. For since he who is suspended upon a cross is both conspicuous to all and higher than others, the cross was especially chosen, which might signify that He would be so conspicuous, and so raised on high, that all nations from the whole world should meet together at once to know and worship Him. Lastly, no nation is so uncivilized, no region so remote, to which either His passion or the height of His majesty would be unknown. Therefore in His suffering He stretched forth His hands and measured out the world, that even then He might show that a great multitude, collected together out of all languages and tribes, from the rising of the sun even to his setting, was about to come under His wings, and to receive on their foreheads that great and lofty sign.[fn-16-P1628_661901:358-nf] And the Jews even now exhibit a figure of this transaction when they mark their thresholds with the blood of a lamb.

And thus, when the first-born of the Egyptians had perished in one night, the Hebrews alone were saved by the sign of the blood: not that the blood of a sheep had such efficacy in itself as to be the safety of men, but it was an image of things to come. For Christ was the white lamb without spot; that is, He was innocent, and just, and holy, who, being slain by the same Jews, is the salvation of all who have written on their foreheads the sign of blood-that is, of the cross, on which He shed His blood.

Lastly, if there should be placed in the midst one who is evidently suffering from an attack of a demon, and the priest of the Delphian Apollo, they will in the same manner dread the name of God; and Apollo will as quickly depart from his priest as the spirit of the demon from the man; and his god being adjured and put to flight, the priest will be for ever silent.[fn-16-P1647_669497:371-nf] Therefore the demons, whom they acknowledge to be objects of execration, are the same as the gods to whom they offer supplications.","index":"168","references":[{"fn":"16","code":"P1644_666659","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Praesentibus poenis, \"on the spot.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"16","code":"P1645_666857","folder":"ANF-07","text":"So long as Christians were mocked and despised as followers of a crucified one there was a silent testimony and bold confession in this act which must be wholly separated from the mere superstition of degenerate Christians.

We are bound and tied to God by this chain of piety;[fn-16-P1658_672919:378-nf] from which religion itself received its name, not, as Cicero explained it, from carefully gathering,[fn-16-P1659_673132:379-nf] for in his second book respecting the nature of the gods he thus speaks: \"For not only philosophers, but our ancestors also, separated superstition from religion. For they who spent whole days in prayers and sacrifices, that their children might survive[fn-16-P1660_673610:380-nf] them, were called superstitious. But they who handled again, and as it were carefully gathered all things which related to the worship of the gods, were called religious from carefully gathering,[fn-16-P1661_673844:381-nf] as some were called elegant from choosing out, and diligent from carefully selecting and intelligent from understanding. For in all these words there is the same meaning of gathering which there is in the word religious: thus it has come to pass, that in the names superstitious and religious, the one relates to a fault, the other belongs to praise.\" How senseless this interpretation is, we may know from the matter itself. For if both religion and superstition are engaged in the worship of the same gods, there is little or rather no difference between them. For what cause will he allege why he should think that to pray once for the health of sons is the part of a religious man, but to do the same ten times is the part of a superstitious man? For if it is an excellent thing to pray once, how much more so to do it more frequently! If it is well to do it at the first hour, then it is well to do it throughout the day. If one victim renders the deity propitious, it is plain that many victims must render him more propitious, because multiplied services oblige[fn-16-P1662_675337:382-nf] rather than offend.

And this argument has weight also from the contrary. For if it is wrong[fn-16-P1664_675827:384-nf] to pray and sacrifice during whole days, therefore it is wrong to do so once. If it is faulty frequently to wish for the preservation of our children, therefore he also is superstitious who conceives that wish even rarely. Or why should the name of a fault be derived from that, than which nothing can be wished more honourable, nothing more just? For as to his saying, that they who diligently take in hand again the things relating to the worship of the gods are called religious from their carefully gathering; how is it, then, that they who do this often in a day lose the name of religious men, when it is plain from their very assiduity that they more diligently gather those things by which the gods are worshipped?","index":"171","references":[{"fn":"16","code":"P1657_672440","folder":"ANF-07","text":"So our Lord, John xvii. 3: \"This is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.\"","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":17,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"16","code":"P1658_672919","folder":"ANF-07","text":"\"Hoc vinculo pietatis obstricti Deo et religati sumus.\" He returns to this in the same chapter, infra.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"16","code":"P1659_673132","folder":"ANF-07","text":"A religendo.

But all of these, ensnared by frauds of demons, which they ought to have foreseen and guarded against, by their carelessness lost the name and worship of God. For when they are called Phrygians,[fn-17-P1701_687335:410-nf] or Novarians,[fn-17-P1702_687866:411-nf] or Valentinians,[fn-17-P1703_688132:412-nf] or Marcionites,[fn-17-P1704_688402:413-nf] or Anthropians,[fn-17-P1705_688696:414-nf] or Arians,[fn-17-P1706_688786:415-nf] or by any other name they have ceased to be Christians, who have lost the name of Christ, and assumed human and external names.
