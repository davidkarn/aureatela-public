Not that they are themselves the only, or even the principal churches; but what he says to one, he says to all. For they are in no respect different, that on that ground any one should prefer them to the larger number of similar small ones. In the whole world Paul taught that all the churches are arranged by sevens, that they are called seven, and that the Catholic Church is one. And first of all, indeed, that he himself also might maintain the type of seven churches, he did not exceed that number. But he wrote to the Romans, to the Corinthians, to the Galatians, to the Ephesians, to the Thessalonians, to the Philippians, to the Colossians; afterwards he wrote to individual persons, so as not to exceed the number of seven churches. And abridging in a short space his announcement, he thus says to Timothy: \"That thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the Church of the living God.\"[fn-45-P4582_1749774:18-nf] We read also that this typical number is announced by the Holy Spirit by the month of Isaiah: \"Of seven women which took hold of one man.\"[fn-45-P4583_1749934:19-nf] The one man is Christ, not born of seed; but the seven women are seven churches, receiving His bread, and clothed with his apparel, who ask that their reproach should be taken away, only that His name should be called upon them. The bread is the Holy Spirit, which nourishes to eternal life, promised to them, that is, by faith. And His garments wherewith they desire to be clothed are the glory of immortality, of which Paul the apostle says: \"For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on mortality.\"[fn-45-P4584_1750484:20-nf] Moreover, they ask that their reproach may be taken away-that is, that they may be cleansed from their sins: for the reproach is the original sin which is taken away in baptism, and they begin to be called Christian men, which is, \"Let thy name be called upon us.\" Therefore in these seven churches, of one Catholic Church are believers, because it is one in seven by the quality of faith and election.

And in the figure of a man, Matthew strives to declareto us the genealogy of Mary, from whom Christ took flesh. Therefore, in enumerating from Abraham to David, and thence to Joseph, he spoke of Him as if of a man: therefore his announcement sets forth the image of a man. Luke, in narrating the priesthood of Zacharias as he offers a sacrifice for the people, and the angel that appears to him with respect of the priesthood, and the victim in the same description bore the likeness of a calf. John the evangelist, like to an eagle hastening on uplifted wings to greater heights, argues about the Word of God. Mark, therefore, as an evangelist thus beginning, \"The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as it is written in Isaiah the prophet; \"[fn-46-P4629_1764220:24-nf] The voice of one crying in the wilderness,\"[fn-46-P4630_1764313:25-nf] -has the effigy of a lion. And Matthew, \"The hook of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham: \"[fn-46-P4631_1764455:26-nf] this is the form of a man. But Luke said, \"There was a priest, by name Zachariah, of the course of Abia, and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron: \"[fn-46-P4632_1764623:27-nf] this is the likeness of a calf. But John, when he begins, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,\"[fn-46-P4633_1764779:28-nf] sets forth the likeness of a flying eagle. Moreover, not only do the evangelists express their four similitudes in their respective openings of the Gospels, but also the Word itself of God the Father Omnipotent, which is His Son our Lord Jesus Christ, bears the same likeness in the time of His advent. When He preaches to us, He is, as it were, a lion and a lion's whelp. And when for man's salvation He was made man to overcome death, and to set all men free, and that He offered Himself a victim to the Father on our behalf, He was called a calf. And that He overcame death and ascended into the heavens, extending His wings and protecting His people, He was named a flying eagle. Therefore these announcements, although they are four, yet are one, because it proceeded from one mouth. Even as the river in paradise, although it is one, was divided into four heads. Moreover, that for the announcement of the New Testament those bring creatures had eyes within and without, shows the spiritual providence which both looks into the secrets of the heart, and beholds the things which are coming after that are within and without.","index":"75","references":[{"fn":"46","code":"P4629_1764220","folder":"ANF-07","text":"On the Zoa, see p. 341, supra.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"46","code":"P4630_1764313","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Isa. xl. 3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":40,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"46","code":"P4631_1764455","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Matt. i. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":1,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"46","code":"P4632_1764623","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Luke i. 5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":1,"verses":[5]}]},{"fn":"46","code":"P4633_1764779","folder":"ANF-07","text":"John i. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":1,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"text":"8. \"Six wings.\"] These are the testimonies of the books of the Old Testament. Thus, twenty and four make as many as there are elders sitting upon the thrones. But as an animal cannot fly unless it have wings, so, too, the announcement of the New Testament gains no faith unless it have the fore-announced testimonies of the Old Testament, by which it is lifted from the earth, and flies. For in every case, what has been told before, and is afterwards found to have happened, that begets an undoubting faith. Again, also, if wings be not attached to the living creatures, they have nothing whence they may draw their life. For unless what the prophets foretold had been consummated in Christ, their preaching was vain. For the Catholic Church holds those things which were both before predicted and afterwards accomplished. And it flies, because the living animal is reasonably lifted up from the earth. But to heretics who do not avail themselves of the prophetic testimony, to them also there are present living creatures; but they do not fly, because they are of the earth. And to the Jews who do not receive the announcement of the New Testament there are present wings; but they do not fly, that is, they bring a vain prophesying to men, not adjusting facts to their words. And the books of the Old Testament that are received are twenty-four, which you will find in the epitomes of Theodore. But, moreover (as we have said), four and twenty elders, patriarchs and apostles, are to judge His people. For to the apostles, when they asked, saying, \"We have forsaken all that we had, and followed Thee: what shall we have? \"our Lord replied, \"When the Son of man shall sit upon the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.\"[fn-46-P4635_1767708:29-nf] But of the fathers also who should judge, says the patriarch Jacob, \"Dan also himself shall judge his people among his brethren, even as one of the tribes in Israel.\"[fn-46-P4636_1767899:30-nf] ","index":"76","references":[{"fn":"46","code":"P4635_1767708","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Matt. xix. 27, 28.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":19,"verses":[27]}]},{"fn":"46","code":"P4636_1767899","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Gen. xlix. 16.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":49,"verses":[16]}]}]},{"text":"5. \"And from the throne proceeded lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and seven torches of fire burning.\"] And the lightnings, and voices, and thunders proceeding from the throne of God, and the seven torches of fire burning, signify announcements, and promises of adoption, and threatenings.

The burning torches of fire signify the gift of the Holy Spirit, that it is given by the wood of the passion.

What had not been then announced, and what the law had contemplated for Him by its various oblations and sacrifices, it behoved Himself to fulfil.

But because He overcame death, and anticipated the duty of the executioner, He was called as it were slain. He therefore opens and seals again the testament, which He Himself had sealed. The legislator Moses intimating this, that it behoved Him to be sealed and concealed, even to the advent of His passion, veiled his face, and so spoke to the people; showing that the words of his announcement were veiled even to the advent of His time. For he himself, when he had read to the people, having taken the wool purpled with the blood of the calf, with water sprinkled the whole people, saying, \"This is the blood of His testament who hath purified you.\"[fn-46-P4647_1772266:33-nf] It should therefore be observed that the Man is accurately announced, and that all things combine into one. For it is not sufficient that that law is spoken of, but it is named as a testament. For no law is called a testament, nor is any thing else called a testament, save what persons make who are about to die. And whatever is within the testament is sealed, even to the day of the testator's death. Therefore it is with reason that it is only sealed by the Lamb slain, who, as it were a lion, has broken death in pieces, and has fulfilled what had been foretold; and has delivered man, that is, the flesh, from death, and has received as a possession the substance of the dying person, that is, of the human members; that as by one body all men had fallen under the obligation of its death, also by one body all believers should be born again unto life, and rise again.

It is a new thing for men to be sealed with the Holy Spirit. It is a new thing to receive the priesthood of sacred observance, and to look for a kingdom of unbounded promise.

And they said to Him, Lord, wilt Thou, then, that we go and root them up?

What, therefore, He said too little in the trumpets, is here found in the phials.

Moreover, the streets set forth their hearts purified from all uncleanness, transparent with glowing light, that the Lord may justly walk up and down in them.
