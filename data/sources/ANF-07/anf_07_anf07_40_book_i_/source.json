For He says in the Gospel, recapitulating, and confirming, and fulfilling the ten commandments of the law: \"It is written in the law, Thou shalt not commit adultery: but I say unto you, that is, I said in the law, by Moses. But now I say unto you myself, Whosoever shall look on his neighbour's wife to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.\"[fn-52-P5253_1916002:5-nf] Such a one is condemned of adultery, who covets his neighbour's wife in his mind. But does not he that covets an ox or an ass design to steal them to apply them to his own use, and to lead them away? Or, again, does not he that covets a field, and continues in such a disposition, wickedly contrive how to remove the landmarks, and to compel the possessor to part with somewhat for nothing? For as the prophet somewhere speaks: \"Woe to those who join house to house, and lay field to field, that they may deprive their neighbour of somewhat which was his.\"[fn-52-P5254_1916575:6-nf] Wherefore he says: \"Must you alone inhabit the earth?

For if thou art overcome by her, and sinnest with her, eternal death will overtake thee from God; and thou wilt be punished with sensible and bitter torments. Or if thou dost not perpetrate such a wicked act, but shakest her off, and refusest her, in this case thou art not wholly innocent, even though thou art not guilty of the crime itself, but only in so far as through thy adorning thou didst entice the woman to desire thee. For thou art the cause that the woman was so affected, and by her lusting after thee was guilty of adultery with thee: yet art thou not so guilty, because thou didst not send to her, who was ensnared by thee; nor didst thou desire her. Since, therefore, thou didst not deliver up thyself to her, thou shalt find mercy with the Lord thy God, who hath said, \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" and, \"Thou shalt not covet.\"[fn-52-P5271_1920143:17-nf] For if such a woman, upon sight of thee, or unseasonable meeting with thee, was smitten in her mind, and sent to thee, but thou as a religious person didst refuse her,[fn-52-P5272_1920334:18-nf] if she was wounded in her heart by thy beauty, and youth, and adorning, and fell in love with thee, thou wilt be found guilty of her transgressions, as having been the occasion of scandal to her,[fn-52-P5273_1920609:19-nf] and shalt inherit a woe.[fn-52-P5274_1920655:20-nf] Wherefore pray thou to the Lord God that no mischief may befall thee upon this account: for thou art not to please men, so as to commit sin; but God, so as to attain holiness of life, and be partaker of everlasting rest. That beauty which God and nature has bestowed on thee, do not further beautify; but modestly diminish it before men. Thus, do not thou permit the hair of thy head to grow too long, but rather cut it short; lest by a nice combing thy hair, and wearing it long, and anointing thyself, thou draw upon thyself such ensnared or ensnaring women. Neither do thou wear over-fine garments to seduce any; neither do thou, with an evil subtilty, affect over-fine stockings or shoes for thy feet, but only such as suit the measures of decency and usefulness. Neither do thou put a gold ring upon thy fingers; for all these ornaments are the signs of lasciviousness, which if thou be solicitous about in an indecent manner, thou wilt not act as becomes a good man: for it is not lawful for thee, a believer and a man of God, to permit the hair of thy head to grow long, and to brush it up together, nor to suffer it to spread abroad, nor to puff it up, nor by nice combing and platting to make it curl and shine; since that is contrary to the law, which says thus, in its additional precepts: \"You shall not make to yourselves curls and round rasures.\"[fn-52-P5275_1922036:21-nf] Nor may men destroy the hair of their beards, and unnaturally change the form of a man. For the law says: \"Ye shall not mar your beards.\"[fn-52-P5276_1922202:22-nf] For God the Creator has made this decent for women, but has determined that it is unsuitable for men. But if thou do these things to please men, in contradiction to the law, thou wilt be abominable with God, who created thee after His own image.

Abstain from all the heathen books. For what hast thou to do with such foreign discourses, or laws, or false prophets, which subvert the faith of the unstable? For what defect dost thou find in the law of God, that thou shouldest have recourse to those heathenish fables? For if thou hast a mind to read history, thou hast the books of the Kings; if books of wisdom or poetry, thou hast those of the Prophets, of Job, and the Proverbs, in which thou wilt find greater depth of sagacity than in all the heathen poets and sophisters, because these are the words of the Lord, the only wise God. If thou desirest something to sing, thou hast the Psalms; if the origin of things, thou hast Genesis; if laws and statutes, thou hast the glorious law of the Lord God. Do thou therefore utterly abstain from all strange and diabolical books. Nay, when thou readest the law, think not thyself bound to observe the additional precepts; though not all of them, yet some of them. Read those barely for the sake of history, in order to the knowledge of them, and to glorify God that He has delivered thee from such great and so many bonds. Propose to thyself to distinguish what rules were from the law of nature, and what were added afterwards, or were such additional rules as were introduced and given in the wilderness to the Israelites after the making of the calf; for the law contains those precepts which were spoken by the Lord God before the people fell into idolatry, and made a calf like the Egyptian Apis-that is, the ten commandments. But as to those bonds which were further laid upon them after they had sinned, do not thou draw them upon thyself: for our Saviour came for no other reason but that He might deliver those that were obnoxious thereto from the wrath which was reserved far them, that[fn-52-P5287_1925712:24-nf] He might fulfil the Law and the Prophets, and that He might abrogate or change those secondary bonds which were superadded to the rest of the law.

Wherefore by reading these books thou wilt be mightily strengthened in the faith, and edified in Christ, whose body and member thou art. Moreover, when thou walkest abroad in public, and hast a mind to bathe, make use of that bath which is appropriated to men, lest, by discovering thy body in an unseemly manner to women, or by seeing a sight not seemly for men, either thou beest ensnared, or thou ensnarest and enticest to thyself those women who easily yield to such temptations.[fn-52-P5290_1927024:27-nf] Take care, therefore, and avoid such things, lest thou admit a snare upon thy own soul.","index":"29","references":[{"fn":"52","code":"P5287_1925712","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Omitted in V mss.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"52","code":"P5288_1925939","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Omitted in V mss.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"52","code":"P5289_1926029","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Matt. xi. 28.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":11,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"52","code":"P5290_1927024","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Omitted in V mss.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"\nConcerning a Bad Woman.","index":"30","references":[]},{"text":"VII.

Besides, when thou hast committed lewdness with one man, and beginnest to despair, thou wilt again turn away from thy duty, and follow others, and grow past feeling; as says the divine word: \"When a wicked man comes into the depth of evil, he becomes a scorner, and then disgrace and reproach come upon him.\"[fn-53-P5307_1934055:38-nf] For such a woman afterward being wounded, ensnares without restraint the souls of the foolish. Let us learn, therefore, how the divine word, triumphs over such women, saying: \"I hated a woman who is a snare and net to the heart of men worse than death; her hands are fetters.\"[fn-53-P5308_1934353:39-nf] And in another passage: \"As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is beauty in a wicked woman.\"[fn-53-P5309_1934472:40-nf] And again: \"As a worm in wood, so does a wicked woman destroy her husband.\"[fn-53-P5310_1934567:41-nf] And again: \"It is better to dwell in the corner of the house-top, than with a contentious and an angry woman.\"[fn-53-P5311_1934704:42-nf] You, therefore, who are Christian women, do not imitate such as these. But thou who designest to be faithful to thine own husband, take care to please him alone. And when thou art in the streets, cover thy head; for by such a covering thou wilt avoid being viewed of idle persons. Do not paint thy face, which is God's workmanship; for there is no part of thee which wants ornament, inasmuch as all things which God has made are very good. But the lascivious additional adorning of what is already good is an affront to the bounty of the Creator. Look downward when thou walkest abroad, veiling thyself as becomes women.","index":"33","references":[{"fn":"53","code":"P5301_1929972","folder":"ANF-07","text":"1 Cor. xi. 3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","verses":[{"chapter":11,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"53","code":"P5302_1930361","folder":"ANF-07","text":"\"To whom be glory,\" V. mss.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"53","code":"P5303_1932533","folder":"ANF-07","text":"The incorrect rendering of the LXX. is here cited, as given in the text.-R.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"53","code":"P5304_1932698","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Prov. xxxi. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","verses":[{"chapter":31,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"53","code":"P5305_1932780","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Prov. xii. 4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","verses":[{"chapter":12,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"53","code":"P5306_1932845","folder":"ANF-07","text":"A.V., \"Every wise woman buildeth her house.\"-R.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"53","code":"P5307_1934055","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Prov. xviii. 3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","verses":[{"chapter":18,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"53","code":"P5308_1934353","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Eccles. vii. 26.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"53","code":"P5309_1934472","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Prov. xi. 22.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","verses":[{"chapter":11,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"53","code":"P5310_1934567","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Prov. xii. 4 in LXX.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"53","code":"P5311_1934704","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Prov. xxi. 9, 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","verses":[{"chapter":21,"verses":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19]}]}]}]},{"text":"\nThat a Woman Must Not Bathe with Men.","index":"34","references":[]},{"text":"IX. Avoid also that disorderly practice of bathing in the same place with men; for many are the nets of the evil one. And let not a Christian woman bathe with an hermaphrodite; for if she is to veil her face, and conceal it with modesty from strange men, how can she bear to enter naked into the bath together with men? But if the bath be appropriated to women, let her bathe orderly, modestly, and moderately. But let her not bathe without occasion, nor much, nor often, nor in the middle of the day, nor, if possible, every day; and let the tenth hour of the day be the set time for such seasonable bathing.
