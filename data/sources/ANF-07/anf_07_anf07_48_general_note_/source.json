They presuppose the formulas to be found in the eighth book of the Constitutions,[fn-69-P6992_2348188:208-nf] and are such instructions as were imparted only to catechumens; the part peculiar to presbyters being withheld, of course, as esoteric mysteries, until further knowledge was canonically appropriate. See Elucidation IV. vol. vi. p. 236; and in this volume, Elucidation I. p. 382. The Bryennios ms.is cleared from nearly all difficulties by Dr. Riddle's lucid notes, when compared with corresponding passages in the Constitutions, or illustrated by such as are supplementary.
