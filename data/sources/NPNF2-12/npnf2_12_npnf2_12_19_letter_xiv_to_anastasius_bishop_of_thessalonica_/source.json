For as it was free for you to suspend the more important matters and the harder issues while you awaited our opinion, there was no reason nor necessity for you to go out of your way to decide what was beyond your powers. For you have numerous written warnings of ours in which we have often instructed you to be temperate in all your actions: that with loving exhortations you might provoke the churches of Christ committed to you to healthy obedience. Because, although as a rule there exist among careless or slothful brethren things which demand a strong hand in rectifying them; yet the correction ought to be so applied as ever to keep love inviolate. Wherefore also it is that the blessed Apostle Paul, in instructing Timothy upon the ruling of the Church, says: \"an eider rebuke not, but intreat him as a father: the young men as brethren: old women as mothers: young women as sisters in all purity[fn-6-P694_134036:3-nf] .\" And if this moderation is due by the Apostle's precept to all and any of the lower members, how much more is it to be paid without offence to our brethren and fellow-bishops? in order that although things sometimes happen which have to be reprimanded in the persons of priests, yet kindness may have more effect on those who are to be corrected than severity: exhortation than perturbation: love than power. But they who \"seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's[fn-6-P695_134537:4-nf] ,\" easily depart from this law, and finding pleasure rather in domineering over their subjects than in consulting their interests, are swoln with the pride of their position, and thus what was provided to secure harmony ministers to mischief. That we are obliged to speak thus causes us no small grief. For I feel myself in a certain measure drawn into blame, on discovering you to have so immoderately departed from the rules handed down to you. If you were careless of your own reputation, you ought at least to have spared my good name: lest what only your own mind prompted should seem done with our approval. Do but read, brother, our pages with care, and peruse all the letters sent by holders of the Apostolic See to your predecessors, and you will find injunctions either from me or from my predecessors on that in which we learn you have presumed.","index":"18","references":[{"fn":"6","code":"P693_132580","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"See Letter IV., where it will be remembered the appointment of Anastasius, as Vicar of Illyricum, was made.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"6","code":"P694_134036","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"1 Tim. v. 1, 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 timothy","chapter":5,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"6","code":"P695_134537","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Phil. ii.21.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"For there has come to us our brother Atticus, the metropolitan[fn-6-P697_135472:5-nf] bishop of Old Epirus, with the bishops of his province, and with tearful pleading has complained of the undeserved contumely he has suffered, in the presence of your own deacons who, by giving no contradiction to these woeful complaints, showed that what was impressed upon us did not want for truth. We read also in your letter, which those same deacons of yours brought, that brother Atticus had come to Thessalonica, and that he had also sealed his agreement in a written profession, so that we could not but understand concerning him that it was of his own will and free devotion that he had come, and that he had composed the statement of his promise of obedience, although in the very mention of this statement a sign of injury was betrayed. For it was not necessary that he should be bound in writing, who was already proving his obedience by the very dutifulness of his voluntary coming. Wherefore these words in your letter bore witness to the bewailings of the aforesaid, and through his outspoken account that which had been passed over in silence is laid bare, namely that the Praefecture of Illyricum had been approached, and the most exalted functionary among the potentates of the world[fn-6-P698_136791:6-nf] had been set in motion to expose an innocent prelate: so that a company was sent to carry out the aweful deed who were to enlist all the public servants in giving effect to their orders, and from the church's holy sanctuary charged with no crime, or at best a false one, was dragged a priest, to whom no truce was granted in consideration of his grievous ill-health or the cruel winter weather: but he was forced to take a journey full of hardships and dangers through the pathless snows.

But, as I perceive, you thought too well of my habits, and most truly foresaw how fair-minded[fn-7-P701_138243:8-nf] an answer I was likely to make to preserve harmony among priests: and therefore you made haste to carry out your movements without concealment, lest when you had received the letter of our forbearance dictating another course, you should have no licence to do that which is done.

Wherefore as what you bestow a pious care on delights us much, so your wrongful acts grieve us sorely.

For to this end we direct all our desires and pains, that what conduces to our harmonious unity and to the protection of discipline may be marred by no dissension and neglected by no slothfulness. Therefore, dearly beloved brother, you and those our brethren who are offended at your extravagant conduct (though the matter of complaint is not the same with all), we exhort and warn not to disturb by any wrangling what has been rightfully ordained and wisely settled. Let none \"seek what is his own, but what is another's,\" as the Apostle says: \"Let each one of you please his neighbour for his good unto edifying[fn-7-P739_148375:15-nf] .\" For the cementing of our unity cannot be firm unless we be bound by the bond of love into an inseparable solidity: because \"as in one body we have many members, but all the members have not the same office; so we being many are one body in Christ, and all of us members one of another[fn-7-P740_148697:16-nf] .\" The connexion of the whole body makes all alike healthy, all alike beautiful: and this connexion requires the unanimity indeed of the whole body, but it especially demands harmony among the priests. And though they have a common dignity, yet they have not uniform rank; inasmuch as even among the blessed Apostles, notwithstanding the similarity of their honourable estate, there was st certain distinction of power, and while the election of them all was equal, yet it was given to one[fn-7-P741_149254:17-nf] to take the lead of the rest. From which model has arisen a distinction between bishops also, and by an important ordinance it has been provided[fn-7-P742_149420:18-nf] that every one should not claim everything for himself: but that there should be in each province one whose opinion should have the priority among the brethren: and again that certain whose appointment is in the greater cities should undertake a fuller responsibility, through whom the care of the universal Church should converge towards Peter's one seat, and nothing anywhere should be separated from its Head. Let not him then who knows he has been set over certain others take it ill that some one has been set over him, but let him himself render the obedience which he demands of them: and as he does not wish to bear a heavy load of baggage, so let him not dare to place on another's shoulders a weight that is insupportable. For we are disciples of the humble and gentle Master who says: \"Learn of Me, for I am gentle and humble of heart, and ye shall find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden light[fn-7-P743_150385:19-nf] .\" And how shall we experience this, unless this too comes to our remembrance which the same Lord says: \"He that is greater among you, shall be your servant.
