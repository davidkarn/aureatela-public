But that this may be properly observed and guarded, the integrity of the catholic Faith must first of all be preserved, and, because in all cases \"narrow\" and steep \"is the way that leadeth unto life[fn-16-P1673_397344:2-nf] ,\" there must be no deviation from its track, either to the right hand or to the left. And because the evangelical and Apostolic Faith has to combat all errors, on the one side casting down Nestorius, on the other crushing Eutyches and his accomplices, remember the need of observing this rule, that all those who in that synod[fn-16-P1674_397693:3-nf] , which cannot, and does not deserve to have the name of Synod, and in which Dioscorus displayed his bad feeling, and Juvenal[fn-16-P1675_397853:4-nf] his ignorance, grieve as we learn from your account, beloved, that they were conquered by fear, and being overcome with terror, were able to be forced to assent to that iniquitous judgment, and who now desire to obtain catholic communion, are to receive the peace of the brethren after due assurance of repentance, on condition that in no doubtful terms they anathematize, execrate and condemn Eutyches and his dogma and his adherents.","index":"7","references":[{"fn":"16","code":"P1672_396624","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Viz., in Letter LXXX., chap, iv : see also chap. iii","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"16","code":"P1673_397344","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"S.

And in the Church over which the Lord has willed you to rule, let none such as we have already written[fn-16-P1679_399141:5-nf] have their names read at the altar until the course of events shows what ought to be determined concerning them.","index":"9","references":[{"fn":"16","code":"P1679_399141","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Viz., in Letter LXXX.. chap. iii., where see note.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"\nIII.

And so, dearest brother, do your endeavour with these brethren whom we have chosen as suitable agents in so great a matter faithfully and effectually to carry out what is agreeable to the Church of God: especially as the very nature of the case, and the promise of Divine aid incite you, and our most gracious princes show such holy faith, such religious devotion, that we find in them not only the general sympathy of Christians, but even that of the priesthood. Who assuredly in accordance with that piety, whereby they boast themselves to be servants of God, will receive all your suggestions for the benefit of the catholic Faith in a worthy spirit, so that by their aid also the peace of Christendom can be restored and wicked error destroyed. And if on any points more advice is needed, let word be quickly sent to us, that after investigating the nature of the case, we may carefully prescribe the rightful measures. Dated 9th of June in the consulship of the illustrious Adelfius (451).","index":"11","references":[{"fn":"16","code":"P1683_399405","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Commonitorium .
