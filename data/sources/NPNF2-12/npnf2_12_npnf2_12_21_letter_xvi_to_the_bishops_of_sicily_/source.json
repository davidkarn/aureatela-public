You could never have fallen into this fault, if you had taken the whole of your observances from the source whence you derive your consecration to the episcopate; and if the see of the blessed Apostle Peter, which is the mother of your priestly dignity, were the recognized teacher of church-method. We could indeed have endured your departure from its rules with less equanimity, if you had received any previous rebuke by way of warning from us. But now as we do not despair of correcting you, we must show gentleness.

Among these varieties of circumstance must be included His growth of body: the Lord increases, as the evangelist bears witness, with the progress of age and grace: at the time of the Passover He comes to the temple at Jerusalem with His parents, and when He was absent from the returning company, He is found sitting with the ciders and disputing among the wondering masters and rendering an account of His remaining behind: \"why is it,\" He says, \"that ye sought Me? did ye not know that I must be in that which is My Father's[fn-8-P856_189982:3-nf] ,\" signifying that He was the Son of Him whose temple He was in. Once more when in later years He was to be declared more openly and sought out the baptism of His forerunner John, was there any doubt of His being God remaining when after the baptism of the Lord Jesus the Holy Spirit in form of a dove descended and rested upon Him, and the Father's voice was heard from the skies, \"Thou art My beloved Son: in Thee I am well pleased[fn-8-P857_190664:4-nf] ?\" All these things we have alluded to with as much brevity as possible for this reason, that you may know, beloved, that though all the daysof Christ's life were hallowed by many mighty works of His[fn-8-P858_190885:5-nf] , and though in all His actions mysterious sacraments[fn-8-P859_191044:6-nf] shone forth, yet at one time intimations of events were given by signs, and at one time fulfilment realized: and that all the Saviour's works that are recorded are not suitable to the time of baptism. For if we were to commemorate with indiscriminate honour these things also which we know to have been done by the Lord after His baptism by the blessed John, His whole life- time would have to be observed in a continuous succession of festivals, because all His acts were full of miracles. But because the Spirit of wisdom and knowledge so instructed the Apostles and teachers of the whole Church as to allow nothing disordered or confused to exist in our Christian observances, we must discern the relative importance of the various solemnities and observe a reasonable distinction in all the institutions of our fathers and rulers: for we cannot otherwise \"be one flock and one shepherd[fn-8-P860_192227:7-nf] ,\" except as the Apostle teaches us, \"that we all speak the same thing: and that we be perfected in the same mind and in the same judgment[fn-8-P861_192384:8-nf] .\"","index":"17","references":[{"fn":"8","code":"P856_189982","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"S.

The Reason Explained Why Easier and Whitsuntide are the Proper Seasons for Baptism.","index":"18","references":[]},{"text":"Although, therefore, both these things which are connected with Christ's humiliation and those which are connected with His exaltation meet in one and the same Person, and all that is in Him of Divine power and human weakness conduces to the accomplishment of our restoration: yet it is appropriate that the power of baptism should change the old into the new creature on the death-day of the Crucified and the Resurrection-day of the Dead: that Christ's death and His resurrection may operate in the re-born[fn-8-P865_192999:9-nf] , as the blessed Apostle says: \"Are ye ignorant that all we who were baptized in Christ Jesus, were baptized in His death? We were buried with Him through baptism into death; that as Christ rose from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have become united with the likeness of His death, we shall be also (with the likeness) of His resurrections[fn-8-P866_193460:10-nf] ,\" and the rest which the Teacher of the Gentiles discusses further in recommending the sacrament of baptism: that it might be seen from the spirit of this doctrine that that is the day, and that the time chosen for regenerating the sons of men and adopting them among the sons of God, on which by a mystical symbolism and form[fn-8-P867_193954:11-nf] , what is done in the limbs coincides with what wasdone in the Head Himself, for in the baptismal office death ensues through the slaying of sin, and threefold immersion imitates the lying in the tomb three days, and the raising out of the water is like Him that rose again from the tomb[fn-8-P868_194285:12-nf] . The very nature, therefore of the act teaches us that that is the recognized day for the general reception of the grace[fn-8-P869_194535:13-nf] , on which the power of the gift and the character of the action originated. And this is strongly corroborated by the consideration that the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, after He rose from the dead, handed on both the form and power of baptizing to His disciples, in whose person all the chiefs of the churches received their instructions with these words, \"Go ye and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghosts[fn-8-P870_195205:14-nf] .\" On which of course He might have instructed them even before His passion, had He not especially wished it to be understood that the grace of regeneration began with His resurrection. It must be added, indeed, that the solemn season of Pentecost, hallowed by the coming of the Holy Ghost is also allowed, being as it were, the sequel and completion of the Paschal feast. And while other festivals are held on other days of the week, this festival (of Pentecost) always occurs on that day, which is marked by the Lord's resurrection: holding out, so to say, the hand of assisting grace and inviting those, who have been cut off from the Easter feast by disabling sickness or length of journey or difficulties of sailing, to gain the purpose that they long for through the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the Only-begotten of God Himself wished no difference to be felt between Himself and the Holy Spirit in the Faith of believers and in the efficacy of His works: because there is no diversity in their nature, as He says, \"I will ask the Father and He shall give you another Comforter that He may be with you for ever, even the Spirit of Truth[fn-8-P871_196375:15-nf] ;\" and again: \"But the Comforter which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I said unto you[fn-8-P872_196578:16-nf] ;\" and again: \"When He, the Spirit of Truth, is come, He shall guide you into all the Truth[fn-8-P873_196685:17-nf] .\" And thus, since Christ is the Truth, and the Holy Spirit the Spirit of Truth, and the name of \"Comforter\" appropriate to both, the two festivals are not dissimilar, where the sacrament is the same[fn-8-P874_196905:18-nf] .

As, therefore, the Old Testament was the witness to the new, and \"the law was given by Moses: but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ[fn-8-P894_201969:29-nf] ;\" as the divers sacrifices prefigured the one Victim, and the slaughter of many lambs was ended by the offering up of Him, of whom it is said, \"Behold the Lamb of God; behold Him that taketh away the sin of the world[fn-8-P895_202281:30-nf] ;\" so too John, not Christ, but Christ's forerunner, not the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom, was so faithful in seeking, \"not His own, but the things which are Jesus Christ's[fn-8-P896_202490:31-nf] ,\" as to profess himself unworthy to undo the shoes of His feet: seeing that He Himself indeed baptized \"in water unto repentance,\" but He who with twofold power should both restore life and destroy sins, was about to \"baptize in the Holy Ghost and fire[fn-8-P897_202763:32-nf] .\" then, beloved brethren, all these distinct proofs come before you, whereby to the removal of all doubt you recognize that in baptizing the elect who, according to the Apostolic rule have to be purged by exorcisms, sanctified by fastings and instructed by frequent sermons, two seasons only are to be observed, viz. Easter and Whitsuntide: we charge you, brother, to make no further departure from the Apostolic institutions.
