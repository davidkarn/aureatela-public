For what is a greater incentive to cheerfulness than the Faith? what better inducement to exultation than the Divine knowledge which the Saviour Himself gave us from above for salvation, saying, \"go ye and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all things that I have enjoined you[fn-17-P1797_417712:2-nf] .\" And this golden chain leading down from the Author of the command to us, you yourself have stedfastly preserved, being set as the mouthpiece unto all of the blessed Peter, and imparting the blessedness of his Faith unto all. Whence we too, wisely taking you as our guide in all that is good, have shown to the sons of the Church their inheritance of Truth, not giving our instruction each singly and in secret, but making known our confession of the Faith in conceit, with one consent and agreement And we were all delighted, revelling, as at an imperial banquet, in the spiritual food, which Christ supplied to us through your letter: and we seemed to see the Heavenly Bridegroom actually present with us. For if \"where two or three are gathered together in His name,\" He has said that \"there He is in the midst of them[fn-17-P1798_418564:3-nf] ,\" must He not have been much more particularly present with 520 priests, who preferred the spread of knowledge concerning Him to their country and their ease? Of whom you were, chief, as the head to the members, showing your goodwill[fn-17-P1799_418819:4-nf] in the person of those who represented you; whilst our religious Emperors presided to the furtherance of due order, inviting us to restore the doctrinal fabric of the Church, even as Zerubbabel invited Joshua to rebuild Jerusalem[fn-18-P1800_419101:5-nf] .","index":"8","references":[{"fn":"17","code":"P1796_417212","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Ps. cxxvi. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":126,"verses":[2]}]},{"fn":"17","code":"P1797_417712","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"S.

And instead of showing penitence for this, instead of begging mercy with tears, he exulted as if over virtuous actions, rejecting your holiness' letter and resisting all the dogmas of the Truth.","index":"10","references":[]},{"text":"\nIII.

But he, being absolutely convicted by his own conscience[fn-18-P1808_421320:7-nf] , by shirking the trial gave countenance to the accusations and rejected the three lawful summonses he received. In consequence of which, we ratified with such moderation as we could the vote which he had passed against himself by his blunders, stripping the wolf of his shepherd's skin, which he had long been convicted of wearing for a pretence. Thereupon our troubles ceased and straightway a time of welcome happiness set in: and having pulled up one tare, we filled the whole world to our delight with pure grain: and having received, as it were, full power to rootup and to plant, we limited the up-rooting to one and carefully plant a crop of good fruit. For it was God who worked, and the triumphant Euphemia who crowned the meeting as for a bridal[fn-18-P1809_422276:8-nf] , and who, taking our definition of the Faith as her own confession, presented it to her Bridegroom by our most religious Emperor and Christ-loving Empress, appeasing all the tumult of opponents and establishing our confession of the Truth asacceptable to Him, and with hand and tonguesetting her seal[fn-18-P1810_422835:9-nf] to the votes of us all in proclamation thereof These are the things we have done, with you present in the spirit and known to approve of us as brethren, and all but visible to us through the wisdom of your representatives.","index":"12","references":[{"fn":"18","code":"P1807_420840","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"1 Tim. ii. 4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 timothy","chapter":2,"verses":[4]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1808_421320","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"e0n e9autw= akpaton tou= suneido/toj e#cwn to\\n e#legcon.There seem's however, some grounds, but no actual necessity for the reading e!ggpafon = written (instead of Akpaton) adopted by the Ball.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1809_422276","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"h9 to\\n su/llogon tw= numfw=ni (lit. bride-chamber) stefanou=sa kalli/nikoj Eu0fhmia ; this obscure passage is to a certain extent elucidated by Letter CI., chap. iii.

The long prevailing custom, which the holy Church of God at Constantinople had of ordaining metropolitans for the provinces of Asia, Pontus and Thrace, we have now ratified by the votes of the Synod, not so much by way of conferring a privilege on the See of Constantinople as to provide for the good government of those cities, because of the frequent disorders that arise on the death of their bishops, both clergy and laity being then without a leader and disturbing church order. And this has not escaped your holiness, particularly in the case of Ephesus, which has often caused you annoyance[fn-18-P1814_424057:10-nf] . We have ratified also the canon of the 150 holy Fathers who met at Constantinople in the time of the great Theodosius of holy memory, which ordains that after your most holy and Apostolic See, the See of Constantinople shall take precedence, being placed second: for we are persuaded that with your usual care for others you have often extended that Apostolic prestige which belongs to you, to the church in Constantinople also, by virtue of your great disinterestedness in sharing all your own good things with your spiritual kinsfolk. Accordingly vouchsafe most holy and blessed father to accept as your own wish, and as conducing to good government the things which we have resolved on for the removal of al confusion and the confirmation of church order. For your holiness' delegates, the most pious bishops Paschasinus and Lucentius, and with them the right Godly presbyter Boniface, attempted vehemently to resist these decisions, from a strong desire that this good work also should start from your foresight, in order that the establishment of good order as well as of the Faith should be put to your account. For we duly regarding our most devout and Christ loving Emperors, who delight therein, and the illustrious senate and, so to say, the whole imperial city, considered it opportune to use the meeting of this ecumenical Synod for the ratification of your honour, and confidently corroborated this decision as if it were initiated by you with your customary fostering zeal, knowing that every success of the children rebounds to the parent's glory. Accordingly, we entreat you, honour our decision by your assent, and as we have yielded to the head our agreement on things honourable, so may the head also fulfil for the children what is fitting. For thus will our pious Emperors be treated with due regard, who have ratified your holiness' judgment as law, and the See of Constantinople will receive its recompense for having always displayed such loyalty on matters of religion towards you, and for having so zealously linked itself to you in full agreement. But that you may know that we have done nothing for favour or in hatred, but as being guided by the Divine Will, we have made known to you the whole scope of our proceedings to strengthen our position and to ratify and establish what we have done[fn-18-P1815_426541:11-nf] .","index":"14","references":[{"fn":"18","code":"P1814_424057","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"The reference (acc. to Ball.) is to the dispute about the bishopric between Bassian and Stephen, in which Leo interfered, though the letter is not extant.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1815_426541","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"One of the Latin version's adds the names and titles of the subscribing bishops here.
