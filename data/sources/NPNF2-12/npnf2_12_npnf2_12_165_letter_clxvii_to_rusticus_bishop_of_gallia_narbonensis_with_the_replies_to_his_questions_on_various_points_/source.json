But since the Lord says, \"blessed is he who shall persevere unto the end[fn-25-P2599_602481:6-nf] ,\" whence shall come this blessed perseverance, except from the strength of patience? For as the Apostle proclaims, \"All who would live godly in Christ shall suffer persecution[fn-26-P2600_602680:7-nf] .\" And it is not only to be reckoned persecution, when sword or fire or other active means are used against the Christian religion; for the direst persecution is often inflicted by nonconformity of practice and persistent disobedience and the barbs of ill-natured tongues: and since all the members of the Church are always liable to these attacks, and no portion of the faithful are free from temptation, so that a life neither of ease nor of labour is devoid of danger, who shall guide the ship amidst the waves of the sea. if the helmsman quit his post? Who shall guard the sheep from the treachery of wolves, if the shepherd himself be not on the watch? Who, in fine, shall resist the thieves and robbers. if love of quietude draw away the watchman that is set to keep the outlook from the strictness of his watch? One must abide, therefore, in the office committed to him and in the task undertaken. Justice must be stedfastly upheld and mercy lovingly extended. Not men, but their sins must be hated[fn-26-P2601_603705:8-nf] . The proud must be rebuked, the weak must be borne with; and those sins which require severer chastisement must be dealt with in the spirit not of vindictiveness but of desire to heal. And if a fiercer storm of tribulation fall upon us, let us not be terror-stricken as if we had to overcome the disaster in our own strength, since both our Counsel and our Strength is Christ, and through Him we can do all things, without Him nothing, Who, to confirm the preachers of the Gospel and the ministers of the mysteries, says, \"Lo, I am with you all the days even to the consummation of the age[fn-26-P2602_604536:9-nf] .\" And again He says, \"these things I have spoken unto you that in me ye may have peace.

No consideration permits men to be reckoned among bishops who have not been elected by the clergy, demanded by the laity, and consecrated by the bishops of the province with the assent of the metropolitan[fn-26-P2610_606204:11-nf] . And hence, since the question often arises concerning advancement unduly obtained, who need doubt that that can in no wise be which is not shown to have been conferred on them, And if any clerics have been ordained by such false bishops in those churches which have bishops of their own, and their ordination took place with the consent and approval of the proper bishops, it may be held valid on condition that they continue in the same churches.

The law of continence is the same for the ministers[fn-26-P2618_607717:13-nf] of the altar as for bishops and priests, who when they were laymen or readers, could lawfully marry and have offspring. But when they reached to the said ranks, what was before lawful ceased to be so. And hence, in order that their wedlock may become spiritual instead of carnal, it behaves them not to put away their wives but to \"have them as though they had them not[fn-26-P2619_608313:14-nf] ,\" whereby both the affection of their wives may be retained and the marriage functions cease.","index":"36","references":[{"fn":"26","code":"P2618_607717","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"The order of sub-deacons (acc. to Quesnel) is here particularly meant: cf.

Not every woman that is joined to a man is his wife, even as every son is not his father's heir. But the marriage bond is legitimate between the freeborn and between equals: this was laid down by the Lord long before the Roman law had its beginning. And so a wife is different from a concubine, even as a bondwoman from a freewoman. For which reason also the Apostle in order to show the difference of these persons quotes from Genesis, where it is said to Abraham, \"Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with my son Isaac[fn-26-P2623_609329:15-nf] .\" And hence, since the marriage tie was from the beginning so constituted as apart from the joining of the sexes to symbolize the mystic union of Christ and His Church, it is undoubted that that woman has no part in matrimony, in whose case it is shown that the mystery of marriage has not taken place. Accordingly a clergyman of any rank who has given his daughter in marriage to a man that has a concubine, must not be considered to have given her to a married man, unless perchance the other woman should appear to have become free, to have been legitimately dowered and to have been honoured by public nuptials.","index":"38","references":[{"fn":"26","code":"P2623_609329","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Gal. iv. 30, from Gen. xxi. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"galatians","chapter":4,"verses":[30]},{"book":"genesis","chapter":21,"verses":[10]}]}]},{"text":"\nQuestion V.
