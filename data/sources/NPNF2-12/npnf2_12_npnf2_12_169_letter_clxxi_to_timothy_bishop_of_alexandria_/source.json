This the experience of the Alexandrine church shows, in which the moderation and long suffering of the humble has laid up for themselves great store in return for their patience: because \"the Lord is nigh them that are of a contrite heart, and shall save those that are humble in spirit[fn-27-P2712_623032:2-nf] ,\" our noble Prince's faith being glorified in all things, through whom \"the right-hand of the Lord hath done great acts[fn-27-P2713_623187:3-nf] ,\" in preventing the abomination of antichrist any longer occupying the throne of the blessed Fathers; whose blasphemy has hurt no one more than himself, because although he has induced some to be partners of his guilt, yet he has inexpiably stained himself with blood. And hence concerning that which under the direction of Faith your election, brother, by the clergy, and the laity, and all the faithful, has brought about, I assure you that the whole of the Lord's Church rejoices with me, and it is my strong desire that the Divine pity will in its loving-kindness confirm this joy with manifold signs of grace, your own devotion ministering thereto in all things, so that you may sedulously win over, through the Church's prayers, those also who have hitherto resisted the Truth, to reconciliation with God, and, as a zealous ruler, bring them into union with the mystic body of the catholic Faith, whose entirety admits of no division, imitating that true and gentle Shepherd, who laid down His life for His sheep, and, when one sheep wandered, drove it not back with the lash, but carried it back to the fold on His own shoulders.","index":"6","references":[{"fn":"27","code":"P2711_622621","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Rom. viii. 28.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":8,"verses":[28]}]},{"fn":"27","code":"P2712_623032","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Ps. xxxiv. 18, and cxviii. 16.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":34,"verses":[18]}]},{"fn":"27","code":"P2713_623187","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Ps. xxxiv. 18, and cxviii. 16.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":34,"verses":[18]}]}]},{"text":"\nII.
