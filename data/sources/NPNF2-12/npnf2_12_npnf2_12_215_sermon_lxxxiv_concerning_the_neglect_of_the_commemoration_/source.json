For there is much danger of men becoming ungrateful to God, and through forgetfulness of His benefits not feeling sorrow for the chastisement, nor joy for the liberation. Accordingly I fear, dearly-beloved, lest that utterance of the Prophet be addressed in rebuke to such men, which says, \"thou hast scourged them and they have not grieved: thou hast chastised them, and they have refused to receive correction[fn-40-P4081_1047235:2-nf] \" For what amendment is shown by them in whom such aversion to God's service is found? One is ashamed to say it, but one must not keep silence: more is spent upon demons than upon the Apostles, and mad spectacles draw greater crowds than blessed martyrdoms[fn-40-P4082_1047506:3-nf] . Who was it that restored this city to safety? that rescued it from captivity? the games of the circus-goers or the care of the saints? surely it was by the saints' prayers that the sentence of Divine displeasure was diverted, so that we who deserved wrath, were reserved for pardon.","index":"5","references":[{"fn":"40","code":"P4081_1047235","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Jer. v. 3.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4082_1047506","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Martyria, which the Ball. here consider means the churches built in honour (?on the scene) of the martyrdoms.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"\nII.

And therefore, dearly-beloved, that this brand of ingratitude may not be applied to you, return to the Lord, remembering the marvels which He has deigned to perform among us; and ascribing. our release not, as the ungodly suppose, to the influences of the stars, but to the unspeakable mercy of Almighty God, Who has deigned to soften the hearts of raging barbarians, betake yourselves to the commemoration of so great a benefit with all the vigour of faith. Grave neglect must be atoned for by yet greater tokens of repentance. Let us use the Mercy of Him, Who has spared us, to our own amendment, that the blessed Peter and all the saints, who have always been near us in many afflictions, may deign to aid our entreaties for you to the merciful God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.","index":"7","references":[{"fn":"40","code":"P4086_1048181","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Cf. S.
