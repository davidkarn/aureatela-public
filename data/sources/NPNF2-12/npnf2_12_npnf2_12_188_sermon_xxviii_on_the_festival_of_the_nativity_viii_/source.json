For God the Son of God, the only-begotten of the eternal and not-begotten Father, remaining eternal \"in the form of God,\" and unchangeably and without time[fn-31-P3176_765530:3-nf] possessing the property of being no way different to the Father He received \"the form of a slave\" without loss of His own majesty, that He might advance us to His state and not lower Himself to ours.

For her virginity fecundated by the Holy Spirit at one and the same time brought forth without trace of corruption both the offspring and the Maker of her race. Hence also the same Lord, as the Evangelist relates, asked of the Jews whose son they had learnt Christ to be on the authority of the Scriptures, and when they replied that the tradition was He would come of David's seed, \"How,\" saith He, \"doth David in the Spirit call Him Lord, saying, the Lord said to my Lord: sit thou on My right hand till I place thy enemies as the footstool of thy feet[fn-31-P3180_767292:4-nf] ?\" And the Jews could not solve the question put, because they did not understand that in the one Christ both the stock of David and the Divine nature were there prophesied.","index":"12","references":[{"fn":"31","code":"P3180_767292","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"S.

But because the devil had not shown himself so violent in his attack on the first man as to bring him over to his side without the consent of His free will, man's voluntary sin and hostile desires had to be destroyed in such wise that the standard of justice should not stand in the way of the gift of Grace. And therefore in the general ruin of the entire human race there was but one remedy in the secret of the Divine plan which could succour the fallen, and that was that one of the sons of Adam should be born free and innocent of original transgression, to prevail for the rest both by His example and His merits. Still further, because this was not permitted by natural generation, and because there could be no offspring from our faulty stock without seed, of which the Scripture saith, \"Who can make a clean thing conceived of an unclean seed? is it not Thou who art alone[fn-31-P3184_768860:5-nf] ?\" David's Lord was made David's Son, and from the fruit of the promised branch[fn-31-P3185_768955:6-nf] sprang.

For after investigating almost all false believers' opinions, even those which presume to deny the Holy Spirit, we come to the conclusion that hardly any one has gone astray, unless he has refused to believe the reality of the two natures in Christ under the confession of one Person. For some have ascribed to the Lord only manhood[fn-31-P3189_770108:7-nf] , others only Deity[fn-31-P3190_770275:8-nf] . Some have said that, though there was in the true Godhead, His flesh was unreal[fn-31-P3191_770435:9-nf] . Others have acknowledged that He took true flesh but say that He had not the nature of God the Father; and by assigning to His Godhead what belonged to His human substance, have made for themselves a greater and a lesser God, although there can be in true Godhead no grades: seeing that whatever is less than God, is not God[fn-31-P3192_770933:10-nf] . Others recognizing that there is no difference between Father and Son, because they could not understand unity of Godhead except in unity of Person, have maintained that the Father is the same as the Son[fn-31-P3193_771391:11-nf] : so that to be born and nursed, to suffer and die, to be buried and rise again, belonged to the same Father who sustained throughout the Person of both Man and the Word. Certain have thought that our Lord Jesus Christ had a body not of our substance but assumed from higher and subtler elements[fn-31-P3194_771740:12-nf] : whereas certain others have considered that in the flesh of Christ there was no human soul, but that the Godhead of the Word Itself fulfilled the part of soul[fn-31-P3195_772122:13-nf] . But their unwise assertion passes into this form that, though they acknowledge the existence of a soul in the Lord, yet they say it was devoid of mind, because the Godhead of Itself was sufficient for all purposes of reason to the Man as well as to the God in Christ. Lastly the same people have dared to assert that a certain portion of the Word was turned into Flesh, so that in the manifold varieties of this one dogma, not only the nature of the flesh and of the soul but also the essence of the Word Itself is dissolved.","index":"16","references":[{"fn":"31","code":"P3189_770108","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"These were called `Psilanthropists\f0' (upholders of the mere manhood): of whom Cerinthus (the opponent of S.

But after all these various impieties, which are closely connected by the relationship that exists between one form of blasphemy and another, we call your devout attention to the avoiding of these two errors in particular: one of which, with Nestorius for its author, some time ago attempted to gainground, but ineffectually; the other, which is equally damnable, has more recently sprung up with Eutyches as its propounder. The former dared to maintain that the blessed Virgin Mary was the mother of Christ's manhood only, so that in her conception and childbearing no union might be believed to have taken place of the Word and the Flesh: because the Son of God did not Himself become Son of Man, but of His mere condescension linked Himself with created man. This can in no wise be tolerated by catholic ears, which are so imbued with the gospel of Truth that they know of a surety there is no hope of salvation for mankind unless He were Himself the Son of the Virgin who was His mother's Creator. On the other hand this blasphemous propounder of more recent profanity has confessed the union of the two Natures in Christ, but has maintained that the effect of this very union is that of the two one remained while the substance of the other no longer existed, which of course could not have been brought to an end except by either destruction or separation[fn-31-P3199_774242:14-nf] . But this is so opposed to sound faith that it cannot be entertained without loss of one's Christian name. For if the Incarnation of the Word is the uniting of the Divine and human natures, but by the very fact of their coming together that which was twofold became single, it was only the Godhead that was born of the Virgin's womb, and went through the deceptive appearance of receiving nourishment and bodily growth: and to pass over all the changes of the human state, it was only the Godhead that was crucified, dead, and buried: so that according to those who thus think, there is no reason to hope for the resurrection, and Christ is not \"the first-begotten from the dead[fn-32-P3200_775378:15-nf] ;\" because He was not One who ought to have been raised again, if He had not been One who could be slain.","index":"18","references":[{"fn":"31","code":"P3199_774242","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"It is doubtful whether Eutyches did ever actually say this, but it was the logical inference from his position: as Gore (p 57), says \"Eutyches never formulated a heresy: he was no philosopher; but he refused to say that the human nature remained in Christ after the Incarnation.
