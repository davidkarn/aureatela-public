When the Lord had made it clear by the words of His sacred prayer that the Divine and the Human Nature was most truly and fully present in Him, showing that the unwillingness to suffer proceeded from the one, and from the other the determination to suffer by the expulsion of all frail fears and the strengthening of His lofty power, then did He return to His eternal purpose, and \"in the form of a\" sinless \"slave\" encounter the devil who was savagely attacking Him by the hands of the Jews: that He in Whom alone was all men's nature without fault, might undertake the cause of all. The sins of darkness, therefore, assailed the true Light, and, for all their torches and lanterns[fn-36-P3641_914984:1-nf] , could not escape the night of their own unbelief, because they did not recognize the Fount of Light. They arrest Him, and He is ready to be seized; they lead Him away, and He is willing to be led; for though, if He had willed to resist, their wicked hands could have done Him no harm, yet thereby the world's redemption would have been impeded, and He, who was to die for all men's salvation, would have saved none at all.","index":"11","references":[{"fn":"36","code":"P3641_914984","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"The allusion doubtless is to the \"lanterns and torches\" mentioned by S.

How Great Was Pilate's Crime in Allowing Himself to Be Led Astray & the Jews.","index":"12","references":[]},{"text":"Accordingly, permitting the infliction on Himself of all that the people's fury inflamed by the priests dared do, He is brought to Annas, father-in-law to Caiaphas, and thence Annas passes Him on to Caiaphas: and after the calumniators' mad accusations, after the lying falsehoods of suborned witnesses, He is transferred to Pilate's hearing by the delegation of the two high-priests, who in neglecting the Divine law, and exclaiming that they had \"no king but Caesar,\" as if they were devoted to the Roman laws, and had left the whole judgment in the hands of the governor, really sought for an accomplisher of their cruelty rather than an umpire of the case. For they gave up Jesus, bound in hard bonds, bruised by many buffets and blows, spat upon, already condemned by their shouts: so that amidst so many signs of their own verdict Pilate might not dare to acquit One Whom all desired to perish. In fact, the very inquiry shows both that he found in the Accused no fault and that in his judgment he did not adhere to his purpose: for as judge he condemns One Whom he pronounces guiltless, invoking on the unrighteous people the blood of the Righteous Man with Whom he felt by his own conviction, and knew from his wife's dream[fn-36-P3645_916811:2-nf] , he must have nothing to do. That stained soul is not cleansed by the washing of hands, there is no expiation in water-besprinkled fingers for the crime abetted by that wicked mind. Pilate's fault is indeed, less than the Jews' crime; for it was they that terrified him with Caesar's name, chode him with hateful words, and drove him to perpetrate his wickedness. But he also did not escape incrimination for playing into the hands of those that made the uproar, for abandoning his own judgment, and for acquiescing in the charges of others.","index":"13","references":[{"fn":"36","code":"P3645_916811","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Cf.

Yet the Jews' Guilt Was Infinitely Greater.","index":"14","references":[]},{"text":"In bowing, therefore, dearly-beloved, to the madness of the impacable people, in permitting Jesus to be dishonoured by much mocking, and harassed with excessive insults, and in displaying Him to the eyes of His persecutors lacerated with scourges, crowned with thorns, and clothed in a robe of scorn, Pilate doubtless thought to appease the enemies' minds, so that when they had glutted their cruel hate, they might cease further to persecute One Whom they beheld subjected to such a variety of afflictions. But their wrath was still in full blaze, and they cried out to him to release Barabbas and thus, Jesus bear the penalty of the cross, and thus, when with consenting murmur the crowd said \"His blood be on us and on our sons[fn-36-P3649_918166:3-nf] ,\" those wicked folk gained, to their own damnation what they had persistently demanded, \"whose teeth,\" as the prophet bore witness, \"were arms and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword[fn-36-P3650_918387:4-nf] .\" For in vain did they keep their own hands from crucifying the Lord of glory when they had hurled at Him the tongue's deadly darts and the poisoned weapons of words. On you, on you, false Jews and unholy leaders of the people, falls the full weight of that crime: and although the enormity of the guilt involves the governor and the soldiers also, yet you are the primary and chief offenders. And in Christ's condemnation, whatsoever wrong was done either by Pilate's judgment or by the cohorts carrying out of his commands, makes you only the more deserving of the hatred of mankind, because the impulse of your fury would not let even those be free from guilt who were displeased at your unrighteous acts.","index":"15","references":[{"fn":"36","code":"P3649_918166","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Cf.

It was not accidental, therefore, but symbolical and mystical, that while the Jews were raging against Christ, a foreigner was found to share His sufferings, as the Apostle says, \"if we suffer with Him, we shall also reign with Him[fn-36-P3659_920914:7-nf] \"; so that no Hebrew nor Israelite, but a stranger, was substituted for the Saviour in His most holy degradation. For by this transference the propitiation of the spotless Lamb and the fulfilment of all mysteries passed from the circumcision to the uncircumcision, from the sons according to the flesh to the sons according to the spirit: since as the Apostle says, \"Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us[fn-36-P3660_921340:8-nf] ,\" Who offering Himself to the Father a new and true sacrifice of reconciliation, was crucified not in the temple, whose worship was now at an end, and not within the confines of the city which for its sin was doomed to be destroyed, but outside, \"without the camp[fn-36-P3661_921621:9-nf] ,\" that, on the cessation of the old symbolic victims, a new Victim might be placed on a new altar, and the cross of Christ might be the altar not of the temple but of the world.","index":"19","references":[{"fn":"36","code":"P3659_920914","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"2 Tim. ii. 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 timothy","chapter":2,"verses":[12]}]},{"fn":"36","code":"P3660_921340","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"1 Cor. v. 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":5,"verses":[7]}]},{"fn":"36","code":"P3661_921621","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Heb. xiii. 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"hebrews","chapter":13,"verses":[12]}]}]},{"text":"\nVI.

Thou didst draw all things unto Thee, Lord, when all the elements combined to pronounce judgment in execration of the Jews' crime, when the lights of heaven were darkened, and the day turned into night, and the earth also was shaken with unwonted shocks, and all creation refused to serve those wicked men. Thou didst draw all things unto Thee, Lord. for the veil of the temple was rent, and the Holy of Holies existed no more for those unworthy high-priests: so that type was turned into Truth, prophecy into Revelation law into Gospel. Thou didst draw all things unto Thee, Lord, so that what before was done in the one temple of the Jews in dark signs, was now to be celebrated everywhere by the piety of all the nations in full and open rite. For now there is a nobler rank of Levites, there are elders of greater dignity and priests of holier anointing: because Thy cross is the fount of all blessings, the source of all graces, and through it the believers receive strength for weakness, glory for shame, life for death. Now, too, the variety of fleshly sacrifices has ceased, and the one offering of Thy Body and Blood fulfils all those different victims: for Thou art the true \"Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world[fn-36-P3672_925115:14-nf] ,\" and in Thyself so accomplishest all mysteries, that as there is but one sacrifice instead of many victims, so there is but one kingdom instead of many nations.","index":"23","references":[{"fn":"36","code":"P3671_923794","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Cf.

For of old He threatened our death with the power of His death, saying. by the mouth of Hosea the prophet, \"O death, I will be thy death, and I will be thy destruction, O hell[fn-36-P3677_926074:16-nf] .\" For by dying He underwent the laws of hell, but by rising again He broke them, and so destroyed the continuity of death as to make it temporal instead of eternal. \"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive[fn-36-P3678_926327:17-nf] .\" And so, dearly-beloved, let that come to pass of which S. Paul speaks, \"that they that live, should henceforth not live to themselves but to Him who died for all and rose again[fn-36-P3679_926527:18-nf] .\" And because the old things have passed away and all things are become new, let none remain in his old carnal life, but let us all be renewed by daily progress and growth in piety. For however much a man be justified, yet so long as he remains in this life, he can always be more approved and better. And he that is not advancing is going back, and he that is gaining nothing is losing something. Let us run, then, with the steps of faith, by the works of mercy, in the love of righteousness, that keeping the day of our redemption spiritually, \"not in the old leaven of malice and wickedness, but in the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth[fn-36-P3680_927193:19-nf] ,\" we may deserve to be partakers of Christ's resurrection, Who with the Father and the Holy Ghost liveth and reigneth for ever and ever.
