For the Omnipotence of the Son of God, whereby He is by the same Essence equal to the Father, might have rescued mankind from the dominion of the devil by the mere exercise of Its will, had it not better suited the Divine working to conquer the opposition of the foe's wickedness by that which had been conquered, and to restore our nature's liberty by that very nature by which bondage had come upon the whole race. But, when the evangelist says, \"The Word became flesh and dwelt in us[fn-37-P3720_936902:1-nf] ,\" and the Apostle, \"God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself[fn-37-P3721_936992:2-nf] ,\" it was shown that the Only-begotten of the Most High Father entered on such a union with human humility, that, when He took the substance of oar flesh and soul, He remained one and the same Son of God by exalting our properties, not His own: because it was the weakness, not the power that had to be reinforced, so that upon the union of the creature with the Creator there should be nothing wanting of the Divine to the assumed, nor of the human to the Assuming.","index":"10","references":[{"fn":"37","code":"P3720_936902","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"S.

For the one Faith justifies the saints of all ages, and to the self-same hope of the faithful pertains all that by Jesus Christ, the Mediator between God and man, we acknowledge done, or our fathers reverently accepted as to be done. And between Jew and Gentile there is no distinction, since, as the Apostle says, \"Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of God's commands[fn-37-P3725_938485:3-nf] ,\" and if they be kept in entirety of faith, they make Christians the true sons of Abraham, that is perfect, for the same Apostle says, \"For whosoever of you were baptized in Christ Jesus, have put on Christ.

For all our weaknesses, which come from sin, He took on Him without sharing in sin, so that He felt the sensation of hunger and thirst and sleep and fatigue, and grief and weeping, and suffered the fiercest pangs up to the extremity of death, because no one could be loosed from the snares of death, unless He in Whom alone all men's nature was guileless allowed Himself to be slain by the hands of wicked men. And hence our Saviour the Son of God provided for all that believe in Him both a mystery and an example[fn-37-P3737_940931:9-nf] , that they might apprehend the one by being born again, and follow the other by imitation. For the blessed Apostle Peter teaches this, saying, \"Christ suffered for us, leaving you an example that ye should follow His steps. Who did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth.
