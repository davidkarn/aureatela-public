But His worthier recompense awaits your acts and deserts, in whose cause you have shown so excellent a zeal, and are now triumphing gloriously over the attainment of the wished-for end. Your clemency must know therefore that all the churches of God join in praising you and rejoicing that the unholy parricide has been cast off from the neck of the Alexandrine church, and that God's people, on whom the abominable robber has been so great a burden, restored to the ancient liberty of the Faith, can now be recalled into the way of salvation by the preaching of faithful priests, when it sees the whole hotbed of pestilence done away with in the person of the originator himself. Now therefore, because you have accomplished this by firm resolution and stedfast will, complete your tale of work for the Faith by passing such decrees as shall be well-pleasing to God in favour of this city's catholic ruler[fn-26-P2687_619186:1-nf] , who is tainted by no trace of the heresy now so often condemned: lest, perchance, the wound apparently healed but still lurking beneath. the scar should grow, and the Christian laity; which by your public action has been freed from the perversity of heretics, should again fall a prey to deadly poison.","index":"7","references":[{"fn":"26","code":"P2687_619186","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"This is another Timothy surnamed Solophaciolus, supposed to be the same as that Timotheos presbyter et oeconomus Ecclesioe, mentioned among the Eyptian refugees who petitioned the Emperor against Aelurus.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"\nII.

For of such the Holy Ghost speaks by the Apostle, \"having an appearance of godliness, but denying the power thereof,\" and again elsewhere, \"they profess that they know God, but in deeds they deny Him[fn-26-P2691_620638:2-nf] .\" And hence, since in every member of the Church both the integrity of the true Faith and abundance of good works is looked for, how much more ought both these things to predominate in the chief pontiff, because the one without the other cannot be in union with the Body of Christ.","index":"9","references":[{"fn":"26","code":"P2691_620638","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"2 Tim. iii. 5, and Tit. i. 16.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 timothy","chapter":3,"verses":[5]},{"book":"titus","chapter":1,"verses":[16]}]}]},{"text":"\nIII.

And hence, even if in his profession of faith he neglects nothing, and deceives us in nothing, it best consorts with your glory absolutely to exclude him from this design of his[fn-26-P2695_621537:3-nf] , because in the bishop of so great a city the universal Church ought to rejoice with holy exultation, so that the true peace of the Lord may be glorified not only by the preaching of the Faith, but also by the example of men's conduct.
