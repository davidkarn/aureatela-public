And this taking on of flesh forms so complete a union, that not only in the blessed Virgin's child-bearing, but also in her conception, no division must be imagined between the Godhead and the life-endowed flesh[fn-17-P1703_402737:2-nf] , since in the unity of person the Godhead and the manhood came together both in the conception and in the childbearing of the Virgin.","index":"8","references":[{"fn":"17","code":"P1702_401492","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Sc.

For, if there is not in Him true and perfect human nature, there is no taking of us upon Him, and the whole of our belief and teaching according to his heresy is emptiness and lying. But because the Truth does not lie and the Godhead is not possible, there abides in God the Word both substances in one Person, and the Church confesses her Saviour in such a way as to acknowledge Him both impossible in Godhead and possible in flesh, as says the Apostle, \"although He was crucified through (our) weakness, yet He lives by the power of God[fn-17-P1707_403903:3-nf] .\"","index":"10","references":[{"fn":"17","code":"P1707_403903","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"2 Cor. xiii. 4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":13,"verses":[4]}]}]},{"text":"\nIII.

And you must understand that the whole church of Constantinople, with all the monasteries and many bishops, have given their assent to it, and by their subscription have anathematized Nestorius and Eutyches with their dogmas. You must also understand that I have recently received the bishop of Constantinople's letter, which states that the bishop of Antioch has sent instructions to all the bishops throughout his provinces, and gained their assent to my epistle, and their condemnation of Nestorius and Eutyches in like manner.","index":"12","references":[]},{"text":"\nIV.

For, whereas the next Easter is to be held by God's goodness on March 23rd, the year after on April 12th, the year after that on April 4th, Theophilus of holy memory has fixed April 24th to be observed in 455, which we find to be quite contrary to the rule of the Church; but in our Easter cycles[fn-17-P1715_406029:5-nf] as you know very well, Easter that year is set down to be kept on April 17th. And therefore, that all our doubts may be removed, we beg you carefully to discuss this point with the best authorities, that for the future we may avoid this kind of mistake.
