About whose most pure light and unconquered power we have already disclosed what was in our heart, in the letter which has been sent to you beloved[fn-12-P1284_315498:4-nf] : lest anything might seem doubtful between us on those things which we have learnt, and teach in accordance with the catholic doctrine. But seeing that the testimonies to the Truth are so clear and strong that a man must be reckoned thoroughly blind and stubborn, who does not at once shake himself free from the mists of falsehood in the bright light of reason; we desire you to use the remedy of long-suffering in curing the madness of ignorance that through your fatherly admonitions they who though old in years are infants in mind, may learn to obey their elders. And if they give up the vain conceits of their ignorance and come to their senses, and if they condemn, all their errors and receive the one true Faith, do not deny them the mercifulness of a bishop's kind heart: although your judgment must remain, if their impiety which you have deservedly condemned persists in its depravity. Dated 23 July in the consulship of the illustrious Asturius and Protogenes (449).","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"12","code":"P1282_314862","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Phil. i. 28.","bible_refs":[{"book":"philippians","chapter":1,"verses":[28]}]},{"fn":"12","code":"P1283_315123","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"1 Tim. iii. 16: the reading here is quod manifestum est in carne , in agreement with the general Western usage.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 timothy","chapter":3,"verses":[16]}]},{"fn":"12","code":"P1284_315498","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Sc. the Tome (XXVIII.).","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"","index":"4","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"5","references":[]}]}]}
