For without being sifted by any test or bound by any previous confession of faith, they make a great point of their right to the privilege of going to one house after another under cover of their being in communion with the Church, and corrupting the hearts of many through men's ignorance[fn-3-P392_51890:4-nf] of their false name. And yet I am sure they could not do this, if the rulers of the churches had exercised their rightful diligence in the matter of receiving such, and had not allowed any of them to wander from place to place.","index":"8","references":[{"fn":"3","code":"P389_50238","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"It is to be supposed that the letter of Septimus, bp. of Altinum, was sent with this letter.

Let them by their public confession condemn the authors of this presumptuous[fn-3-P397_53900:6-nf] error and renounce all that the universal Church has repudiated in their doctrine: and let them announce by full and open statements, signed by their own hand, that they embrace and entirely approve of all the synodal decrees which the authority of the Apostolic See has ratified to the rooting out of this heresy. Let nothing obscure, nothing ambiguous be found in their words. For we know that their cunning is such that they reckon that the meaning of any particular clause of their execrable doctrine can be defended if they only keep it distinct from the main body of their damnable views[fn-3-P398_54724:7-nf] .

And yet surely, unless it is given freely, it is not a gift[fn-4-P402_55177:8-nf] , but a price and compensation for merits: for the blessed Apostle says, \"by grace ye have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves but it is the gift of God; not of works lest any should perchance be exalted. For we are His workmanship created in Christ Jesus in good works, which God prepared that we should walk in them[fn-4-P403_55634:9-nf] .\" Thus every bestowal of good works is of God's preparing: because a man is justified by grace rather than by his own excellence: for grace is to every one the source of righteousness, the source of good and the fountain of merit. But these heretics say it is anticipated by men's natural goodness for this reason, that that nature which(in their view) is before grace conspicuous for good desires of its own, may not seem marred by any stain of original sin, and that what the Truth says may be falsified: \"For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost[fn-4-P404_56226:10-nf] .\"","index":"12","references":[{"fn":"4","code":"P402_55177","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"The reader need hardly be reminded that in the New Testement \"grace\" (Lat.
