And when their proud exaltation hath been cut off, He will lay them low after the imitation of His Own humility, who like a calf was led to slaughter by the nobility of this world. \"For the kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers agreed together against the Lord, and against His Christ.\" \"And the Beloved is as the young of the unicorns.\" For even He the Beloved, and the Only One of the Father, \"emptied Himself\" of His glory; and was made man, like a child of the Jews, that were \"ignorant of God's righteousness,\" and proudly boasting of their own righteousness as peculiarly theirs.","index":"8","references":[]},{"text":"7. \"The Voice of the Lord cutting short the flame of fire\" (ver. 7).
