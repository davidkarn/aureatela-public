Therefore the power is given that they who believe on Him should become the sons of God, since this very thing is given, that they believe on Him.

And here, indeed, they ought at least to concede that \"in the law no one is justified,\" as the same apostle says elsewhere; but that the law avails for the knowledge of sin, and for the transgression of the law itself, so that sin, being known and increased, grace may be sought for through faith. But they do not fear that those things should be understood concerning the apostle which he might also say concerning his past, but they fear those things which follow. For here he says: \"I had not known lust if the law had not said, Thou shall not covet. But the occasion being taken, sin wrought in me by the commandment all manner of lust. For without the law sin was dead. But I was alive without the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died, and the commandment which was for life was found for me to be death. For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me. Therefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, just, and good. Was, then, that which is good made death unto me? By no means.But sin, that it might appear sin, worked death to me by that which is good, that the sinner or the sin might become by the commandment excessive.\" All these things, as I have said, the apostle can seem to have commemorated from his past life: so that from what he says, \"For I was alive without the law once,\" he may have wished his first age from infancy to be understood, before the years of reason; but in that he added, \"But when the commandment came, sin revived, but I died,\" he would fain show himself able to receive the commandment, but not to do it, and therefore a transgressor of the law.","index":"72","references":[]}]},{"name":"Chapter 15 [IX.]-He Sins in Will Who is Only Deterred from Sinning by Fear.","index":17,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Nor let us be disturbed by what he wrote to the Philippians: \"Touching the righteousness which is in the law, one who is without blame.\" For he could be within in evil affections a transgressor of the law, and yet fulfil the open works of the law, either by the fear of men or of God Himself; but by terror of punishment, not by love and delight in righteousness. For it is one thing to do good with the will of doing good, and another thing to be so inclined by the will to do evil, that one would actually do it if it could be allowed without punishment. For thus assuredly he is sinning within in his will itself, who abstains from sin not by will but by fear. And knowing himself to have been such in these his internal affections, before the grace of God which is through Jesus Christ our Lord, the apostle elsewhere confesses this very plainly. For writing to the Ephesians, he says: \"And you, though ye were dead in your trespasses and sins, wherein sometime ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of that spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience, in whom also we all at one time had our conversation in the lusts of our flesh, doing the will of our flesh and our affections, and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others also: but God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us even when we were dead in sins, quickened us together with Christ, by whose grace we are saved.\" Again to Titus he says: \"For we ourselves also were sometime foolish and unbelieving, erring, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and holding one another in hatred.\" Such was Saul when he says that he was, touching the righteousness which is in the law, without reproach. For that he had not pressed on in the law, and changed his character so as to be without reproach after this hateful life, he plainly shows in what follows, when he says that he was not changed from these evils except by the grace of the Saviour. For adding also this very thing, here as well as to the Ephesians, he says: \"But when the kindness and love of God our Saviour shone forth, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and of the renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom He shed on us most abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour, that being justified by His grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.\"","index":"74","references":[]}]},{"name":"Chapter 16.-How Sin Died, and How It Revived.","index":18,"paragraphs":[{"text":"And what he says in that passage of the Epistle to the Romans, \"Sin, that it might appear sin, wrought death to me by that which is good,\"[fn-51-P5113_2013675:40-nf] agrees with the former passages where he said, \"But I had not known sin but by the law, for I had not known lust unless the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.\"[fn-51-P5114_2013855:41-nf] And previously, \"By the law is the knowledge of sin,\" for he said this also here, \"that it might appear sin;\" that we might not understand what he had said, \"For without law sin was dead,\" except in the sense as if it were not, \"it lies hidden, it does not appear, it is completely ignored, as if it were buried in I know not what darkness of ignorance\" And in that he says, \"And I was alive once without the law,\" what does he say except, I seemed to myself to live? And with respect to what he added, \"But when the commandment came, sin revived,\" what else is it but sin shone forth, became apparent? Nor yet does he say lived, but revived.

And yet from these, if they carnally beget children, it is again derived; and again it will be hurtful to those that are born, unless by the same form it is remitted to them as born again, and remains in them in no way hindering the future life, because its guilt, derived by generation, has been put away by regeneration; and thus it is now no more sin, but is called so, whether because it became what it is by sin, or because it is stirred by the delight of sinning, although by the conquest of the delight of righteousness consent is not given to it.

If it is agreeable to you to arrange this in Paradise, and if, by means of such a concupiscence of the flesh which should neither anticipate, nor impede, nor exceed the bidding of the will, it appears to you that children could have been begotten, I have no objection. For, as far asI am concerned in this matter, it is enough for me that such a concupiscence of the flesh is not now among men, as you concede there might have been in that place of happiness. For what it now is, the sense of all men certainly confesses, although with modesty; because it both solicits with excessive and importunate uneasiness the chaste, even when they are unwilling and are checking it by moderation, and frequently withdraws itself from the willing and inflicts itself on the unwilling; so that, by its disobedience, it testifies that it is nothing else than the punishment of that first disobedience. Whence, reasonably, both then the first men when they covered their nakedness, and now whoever considers himself to be a man, every no less modest than immodest person is confounded at it-far be it from us to say by the work of God, but-by the penalty of the first and ancient sin.

For how has the Lord commanded us to pray for those who persecute us? Do we pray thus that the grace of God may be recompensed them for the sake of their good will, and not rather that the evil will itself may be changed into a good one? Just as we believe that at that time the saints whom he was persecuting did not pray for Saul in vain, that his will might be converted to the faith which he was destroying. And indeed that his conversion was effected from above, appeared even by a manifest miracle. But how many enemies of Christ are at the present day suddenly drawn by God's secret grace to Christ! And if I had not set down this word from the gospel, what things would that man have said in this behalf concerning me, since even now he is stirring, not against me, but against Him who cries, \"No man can come to me, except the Father who hath sent me draw him\"![fn-52-P5218_2046306:82-nf] For He does not say, \"except He lead him,\" so that we can thus in any way understand that his will precedes.
