For, concerning this first book, Augustin says himself: \"This book of mine, however, which he [Julianus] says he answered in four books, I wrote after the condemnation of Pelagius and Coelestius. This,\" he adds, \"I have deemed it right to mention, because he declares that my words had been used by the enemies of the truth to bring it into odium. Let no one, therefore, suppose that it was owing to this book of mine that condemnation had been passed on the new heretics who are enemies of the grace of Christ.\"[fn-37-P3795_1443327:125-nf] From these words one may see at once that this first book was published about the same time as the condemnation of the Pelagians in the year 418.","index":"2","references":[{"fn":"37","code":"P3793_1442295","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"The Donatist bishop.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"37","code":"P3794_1442431","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"This work gives an account of the meeting of the catholic bishops at Caesarea on Sept. 20, 418, at which Emeritus was present by invitation.

One of them, Julianus,[fn-37-P3797_1443724:126-nf] influenced with a warm desire of furthering the heretical movement, attacked the first book of Augustin's treatise in four books of his own. Out of these, sundry extracts were culled by some interested person, and forwarded to Count Valerius. Valerius despatched them from Ravenna to Rome, to Alypius,[fn-37-P3798_1444096:127-nf] in order that he, on returning to Africa, might hand them to Augustin for the purpose of an early refutation, together with a letter in which Valerius thanked Augustin for the previous work which he also mentioned. Augustin saw at once that these extracts had been taken out of the work of Julianus; and, although he preferred reserving his answer to the selections till he had received the entire work from which they were culled, he still thought that he was bound to avoid all delay in satisfying the Count Valerius. Without loss of time, therefore, he drew up in answer his second book, with the same title as before, On Marriage and Concupiscence, which, as we think, must be assigned to the year 420, since the holy doctor wrote it immediately after the expression of thanks for the first book; for it is clearly improbable that Valerius should have waited two years or more to make the acknowledgment of his gratitude.","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"37","code":"P3797_1443724","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Bishop of Eclanum in Italy.

These appointments, indeed, had no connection with military service, nor had the prefects of Theodosius anything in common with those of Honorius.
