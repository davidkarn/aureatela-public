For who can say that they are not justified who are obedient to the law, when, unless they were justified, they could not be obedient? But we say, that by the law is effected that what God wills to be done is heard, but that by grace is effected that the law is obeyed. \"For not the hearers of the law,\" says the apostle, \"are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.\"[fn-53-P5386_2114498:1-nf] Therefore the law makes hearers of righteousness, grace makes doers. \"For what was impossible to the law,\" says the same apostle, \"in that it was weak through the flesh, God sent His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.\"[fn-53-P5387_2114899:2-nf] This is what we say;-let them pray that they may one day understand it, and not dispute so as never to understand it. For it is impossible that the law should be fulfilled by the flesh,that is, by carnal presumption, in which the proud, who are ignorant of the righteousness of God,-that is, which is of God to man, that he may be righteous,-and desirous of establishing their own righteousness,-as if by their own will, unassisted from above, the law could be fulfilled,-are not subjected to the righteousness of God.[fn-53-P5388_2115438:3-nf] Therefore the righteousness of the law is fulfilled in them who walk not according to the flesh-that is, according to man, ignorant of the righteousness of God and desirous of establishing his own-but walk according to the Spirit. But who walks according to the Spirit, except whosoever is led by the Spirit of God? \"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God.\"[fn-53-P5389_2115842:4-nf] Therefore \"the letter killeth, but the Spirit maketh alive.\"[fn-53-P5390_2115921:5-nf] And the letter is not evil because it killeth; but it convicts the wicked of transgression. \"For the law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.

For we say that all men who are children of the devil are also children of the world; but not that all children of the world are also children of the devil. Far be it from us to say that the holy fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and others of this kind, were children of the devil when they were begetting in marriage, and those believers who until now and still hereafter continue to beget. And yet we cannot contradict the Lord when He says, \"The children of this world marry and give in marriage.\"[fn-54-P5404_2118890:13-nf] Some, therefore, are children of this world, and yet are not children of the devil. For although the devil is the author and source of all sins, yet it is not every sin that makes children of the devil; for the children of God also sin, since if they say they have no sins they deceive themselves, and the truth is not in them.[fn-54-P5405_2119236:14-nf] But they sin in virtue of that condition by which they are still children of this world; but by that grace wherewith they are the children of God they certainly sin not, because every one that is born of God sinneth not.[fn-54-P5406_2119475:15-nf] But unbelief makes children of the devil; and unbelief is specially called sin, as if it were the only one, if it is not expressed what is the nature of the sin. As when the \"apostle\" is spoken of, if it be not expressed what apostle, none is understood but Paul; because he is better known by his many epistles, and he laboured more than they all. For which reason, in what the Lord said of the Holy Spirit,\" He shall convict the world of sin,\"[fn-54-P5407_2119941:16-nf] He meant unbelief to be understood; for He said this when He was explaining, \"Of sin because they believed not on me,\"[fn-54-P5408_2120078:17-nf] and when He says, \"If I had not come and spoken to them, they should not have sin.\"[fn-54-P5409_2120180:18-nf] For He meant not that before they had no sin, but He wished to indicate that very want of faith by which they did not believe Him even when He was present to them and speaking to them; since they belonged to him of whom the apostle says, \"According to the prince of the power of the air, who now worketh in the children of unbelief.\"[fn-54-P5410_2120532:19-nf] Therefore they in whom there is not faith are the children of the devil, because they have not in the inner man any reason why there should be forgiven them whatever is committed either by human infirmity, or by ignorance, or by any evil will whatever. But those are the children of God who certainly, if they should \"say that they have no sin, deceive themselves,and the truth is not in them, but immediately\" (as it continues) \"when they confess their sins\" (which the children of the devil do not do, or do not do according to the faith which is peculiar to the children of God), \"He is faithful and just to forgive them their sins, and to cleanse them from all unrighteousness.\"[fn-54-P5411_2121232:20-nf] And in order that what we say may be more fully understood, let Jesus Himself be heard, who certainly was speaking to the children of God when He said: \"And if ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him.\"[fn-54-P5412_2121563:21-nf] For if these were not the children of God, He would not say to them, \"Your Father which is in heaven.\" And yet He says that they are evil, and that they know how to give good gifts to their children. Are they, then, evil in that they are the children of God? Away with the thought! But they are thence evil because they are still the children of this world, although now made children of God by the pledge of the Holy Spirit.","index":"36","references":[{"fn":"54","code":"P5404_2118890","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Luke xx. 34.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":20,"verses":[34]}]},{"fn":"54","code":"P5405_2119236","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 John i. 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 john","chapter":1,"verses":[8]}]},{"fn":"54","code":"P5406_2119475","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 John iii. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 john","chapter":3,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"54","code":"P5407_2119941","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"John xvi. 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":16,"verses":[8]}]},{"fn":"54","code":"P5408_2120078","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"John xvi. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":16,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"54","code":"P5409_2120180","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"John xv. 22.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":15,"verses":[22]}]},{"fn":"54","code":"P5410_2120532","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Eph. ii. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"ephesians","chapter":2,"verses":[2]}]},{"fn":"54","code":"P5411_2121232","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 John i. 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 john","chapter":1,"verses":[8]}]},{"fn":"54","code":"P5412_2121563","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Matt. vii. 11.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":7,"verses":[11]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 5.-Baptism Puts Away All Sins, But It Does Not at Once Heal All Infirmities.","index":7,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Baptism, therefore, washes away indeed all sins-absolutely all sins, whether of deeds or words or thoughts, whether original or added whether such as are committed in ignorance or allowed in knowledge; but it does not take away the weakness which the regenerate man resists when he fights the good fight, but to which he consents when as man he is overtaken in any fault; on account of the former, rejoicing with thanksgiving, but on account of the latter, groaning in the utterance of prayers.

But this weakness with which we contend, with alternating failure and progress, even to the death of the body, and which is of great importance as to what it can overcome in us, shall be consumed by another regeneration, of which the Lord says, \"In the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones,\"[fn-54-P5422_2124074:28-nf] etc. Certainly in this passage He without doubt calls the last resurrection the regeneration, which Paul the Apostle also calls both the adoption and the redemption, where he says, \"But even we ourselves, which have the first-fruits of the Spirit, ourselves also groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, the redemption, of our body.\"[fn-54-P5423_2124437:29-nf] Have we not been regenerated, adopted, and redeemed by the holy washing? And yet there remains a regeneration, an adoption, a redemption, which we ought now patiently to be waiting for as to come in the end, that we may then be in no degree any longer children of this world. Whosoever, then, takes away from baptism that which we only receive by its means, corrupts the faith; but whosoever attributes to it now that which we shall receive by its means indeed, but yet hereafter, cuts off hope. For if any one should ask of me whether we have been saved by baptism, I shall not be able to deny it, since the apostle says, \"He saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-54-P5424_2125157:30-nf] But if he should ask whether by the same washing He has already absolutely In every way saved us, I shall answer: It is not so.

Of this kind was that multitude which murmured against God in the wilderness, and made an idol; and that multitude which even in the very land of promise committed fornication after strange gods. But this multitude, even in the old testament itself, was strongly rebuked. They, moreover, whoever they were at that time who followed after those earthly promises alone which God promises there, and who were ignorant of that which those promises signify under the new testament, and who kept God's commandments with the desire of gaining and with the fear of losing those promises,-certainly did not observe them, but only seemed to themselves to observe. For there was no faith in them that worked by love, but earthly cupidity and carnal fear. But he who thus fulfils the commandments beyond a doubt fulfils them unwillingly, and then does not do them in his heart; for he would rather not do them at all, if in respect of those things which he desires and fears he might be allowed to neglect them with impunity.

These pertain to the old testament, which genders to bondage; because carnal fear and desire make them servants, gospel faith and hope and love do not make them children. But they who are placed under grace, whom the Spirit quickens, do these things of faith which worketh by love in the hope of good things, not carnal but spiritual, not earthly but heavenly, not temporal but eternal; especially believing on the Mediator, by whom they do not doubt but that a Spirit of grace is ministered to them, so that they may do these things well, and that they may be pardoned when they sin. These pertain to the new testament, are the children of promise, and are regenerated by God the Father and a free mother. Of this kind were all the righteous men of old, and Moses himself, the minister of the old testament, the heir of the new, -because of the faith whereby we live, of one and the same they lived, believing the incarnation, passion, and resurrection of Christ as future, which we believe as already accomplished,-even until John the Baptist himself as it were a certain limit of the old dispensation, who, signifying that the Mediator Himself would come, not with any shadow of the future or allegorical intimation, or with any prophetical announcement, but pointing Him out with his finger, said: \"Behold the Lamb of God; behold Him who taketh away the sin of the world.\"[fn-54-P5457_2138323:45-nf] As if saying, Whom many righteous men have desired to see, on whom, as about to come, they have believed from the beginning of the human race itself, concerning whom the promises were spoken to Abraham, of whom Moses wrote, of whom the law and the prophets are witnesses: \"Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world.\" From this John and afterwards, all those things concerning Christ began to become past or present, which by all the righteous men of the previous time were believed, hoped for, desired, as future. Therefore the faith is the same as well in those who, although not yet in name, were in fact previously Christians, as in those who not only are so but are also called so; and in both there is the same grace by the Holy Spirit.

Because the old testament was revealed through Moses, by whom the holy and just and good law was given, whereby should be brought about not the doing away but the knowledge of sin,-by which the proud might be convicted who were desirous of establishing their own righteousness, as if they had no need of divine help, and being made guilty of the letter, might flee to the Spirit of grace, not to be justified by their own righteousness, but by that of God-that is, by the righteousness which was given to them of God. For as the same apostle says, \"By the law is the knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and by the prophets.\"[fn-54-P5471_2143467:53-nf] Because the law, by the very fact that in it no man is justified, affords a witness to the righteousness of God. For that in the law no man is justified before God is manifest, because \"the just by faith lives.\"[fn-54-P5472_2143702:54-nf] Thus, therefore, although the law does not justify the wicked when he is convicted of transgression, it sends to the God who justifieth, and thus affords a testimony to the righteousness of God. Moreover, the prophets offer testimony to God's righteousness by fore-announcing Christ, \"who is made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: that, as it is written, he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.\"[fn-54-P5473_2144168:55-nf] But that law was kept hidden from the beginning, when nature itself convicted wicked men, who did to others what they would not have done to themselves. But the revelation of the new testament in Christ was made when He was manifested in the flesh, wherein appeared the righteousness of God -that is, the righteousness which is to men from God. For hence he says, \"But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested.\"[fn-54-P5474_2144621:56-nf] This is the reason why the former is called the old testament, because it was revealed in the earlier time; and the latter the new, because it was revealed in the later time. In a word, it is because the old testament pertains to the old man, from which it is necessary that a man should make a beginning; but the new to the new man, by which a than ought to pass from his old state. Thus, in the former are earthly promises, in the latter heavenly promises; because this pertained to God's mercy, that no one should think that even earthly felicity of any kind whatever could be conferred on anybody, save from the Lord, who is the Creator of all things. But if God is worshipped for the sake of that earthly happiness, the worship is that of a slave, belonging to the children of the bondmaid; but if for the sake of God Himself, so that in the life eternal God may be all things in all, it is a free service belonging to the children of the freewoman, who is our mother eternal in the heavens-who first seemed, as it were, barren, when she had not any children manifest; but now we see what was prophesied concerning her: \"Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for there are many children of the desolate more than of her who has an husband,\"[fn-54-P5475_2145935:57-nf] -that is, more than of that Jerusalem, who in a certain manner is married in the bond of the law, and is in bondage with her children.

But another, who has good works from a right faith which worketh by love, maintains his continency in the honesty of wedlock, although he does not, like the other, well refrain altogether, but pays and repays the debt of carnal connection, and has intercourse not only for the sake of offspring, but also for the sake of pleasure, although only with his wife, which the apostle allows to those that are married as pardonable;-does not receive injuries with so much patience, but is raised into anger with the desire of vengeance, although, in order that he may say, \"As we also forgive our debtors,\" forgives when he is asked;-possesses personal property, giving thence indeed some alms, but not as the former so liberally;-does not take away what belongs to another, but, although by ecclesiastical, not by civil judgment, yet contends for his own: certainly this man, who seems so inferior in morals to the former, on account of the right faith which he has in God, by which he lives, and according to which in all his wrong-doings he accuses himself, and in all his good works praises God, giving to himself the shame, to God the glory, and receiving from Him both forgiveness of sins and love of right deeds,-shall be delivered for this life, and depart to be received into the company of those who shall reign with Christ. Wherefore, if not on account of faith? Which, although without works it saves no man (for it is not a reprobate faith, since it worketh by love), yet by it even sins are loosed, because the just by faith liveth; but without it, even those things which seem good works are turned into sins: \"For everything which is not of faith is sin.\"[fn-54-P5480_2149957:59-nf] And it is brought about, on account of this great difference, that although with no possibility of doubt a persevering integrity of virginity is preferable to conjugal chastity, yet a woman even twice married,if she be a catholic, is preferred to a professed virgin that is a heretic; nor is she in such wise preferred because this one is better in God's kingdom, but because the other is not there at all.

The angels of God, then, are endowed with this perfection of righteousness, since they always behold the face of the Father, and thus of the entire Trinity, because they see through the Son, in the Holy Spirit. But nothing is more sublime than that revelation, nor yet does any of the angels in that contemplation of rejoicing ones find a messenger of Satan needful that he may be buffeted by him, lest so great a magnitude of revelation should lift him up.

For, in respect to this infirmity, that little righteousness of man's is perfect according to its measure, when it understands even what it lacks. And therefore the apostle calls himself both perfect and imperfect,[fn-55-P5510_2161892:74-nf] -imperfect, to wit, in the thought of how much is wanting to him for the righteousness for the fulness of which he is still hungering and thirsting; but perfect in that he does not blush to confess his own imperfection, and goes forward in good that he may attain. As we can say that the wayfarer is perfect whose approach is well forwarded, although his intention is not carried out unless his arrival be actually effected. Therefore, when he had said,\" According to the righteousness which is in the law, I am one who has been without blame,\" he immediately added, \"What things were gain to me, those I counted but loss for Christ's sake. Yea, doubtless, and I count all things to be loss for the sake of the eminent knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord: for whose sake I have believed all things not only to be losses, but I have thought them to be even as dung, that I might gain Christ and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is by the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God in faith.\"[fn-55-P5511_2162967:75-nf] See! the apostle does not, of course, say falsely, that \"according to the righteousness which is of the law he was without blame;\" and yet those things which were gain to him, he casts away for Christ's sake, and thinks them losses, injuries, dung. And not only these things, but all other things which he mentioned previously; not on account of any kind of knowledge, but, as he himself says, \"the eminent knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord,\" which, beyond a doubt, he had as yet in faith, but not yet in sight.

Since, then, that is the law of God, he says it is\" his own\" righteousness \"which is of the law;\" and this righteousness of his own he would not have, but cast it forth as \"dung.\" Why so, except because it is this which I have above demonstrated,[fn-55-P5518_2165030:79-nf] that those are under the law who, being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and going about to establish their own, are not subject to the righteousness of God?[fn-55-P5519_2165216:80-nf] For they think that, by the strength of their own will, they will fulfil the commands of the law; and wrapped up in their pride, they are not converted to assisting grace. Thus the letter killeth[fn-55-P5520_2165428:81-nf] them either openly, as being guilty to themselves, by not doing what the law commands; or by thinking that they do it, although they do it not with spiritual love, which is of God. Thus they remain either plainly wicked or deceitfully righteous,-manifestly cut off in open unrighteousness, or foolishly elated in fallacious righteousness. And by this means-marvellous indeed, but yet true-the righteousness of the law is not fulfilled by the righteousness which is in the law, or by the law, but by that which is in the Spirit of grace. Because the righteousness of the law is fulfilled in those, as it is written, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. But, according to the righteousness which is in the law, the apostle says that he was blameless in the flesh, not in the Spirit; and he says that the righteousness which is of the law was his, not God's. It must be understood, therefore, that the righteousness of the law is not fulfilled according to the righteousness which is in the law or of the law, that is, according to the righteousness of man, but according to the righteousness which is in the Spirit of grace, therefore according to the righteousness of God, that is, which man has from God. Which may be thus more clearly and briefly stated: That the righteousness of the law is not fulfilled when the law commands, and man as it were of his own strength obeys; but when the Spirit aids, and man's free will, but freed by the grace of God, performs. Therefore the righteousness of the law is to command what is pleasing to God, to forbid what is displeasing; but the righteousness in the law is to obey the letter, and beyond it to seek for no assistance of God for holy living. For when he had said, \"Not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is by the faith of Christ,\" he added, \"Which is from God.\" That, therefore, is itself the righteousness of God, being ignorant of which the proud go about to establish their own; for it is not called the righteousness of God because by it God is righteous, but because man has it from God.","index":"68","references":[{"fn":"55","code":"P5518_2165030","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"See above, ch. 6.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"55","code":"P5519_2165216","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. x. 3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":10,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"55","code":"P5520_2165428","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"2 Cor. iii. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":3,"verses":[6]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 21.-That Righteousness is Never Perfected in This Life.","index":23,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Now, according to this righteousness of God, that is, which we have from God, faith now worketh by love.

Because it is said with excessive folly, that God is loved as much before He is seen, as He will be loved when He is seen. Further, if in this life, as no religious person doubts, the more we love God, so much the more righteous we certainly are, who can doubt that pious and true righteousness will then be perfected when the love of God shall be perfect? Then the law, therefore, shall be fulfilled; so that nothing at all is wanting to it, of which law, according to the apostle, the fulfilling is Love. And thus, when he had said,\" Not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is by the faith of Jesus Christ, which is the righteousness from God in faith,\" he then added, \"That I may know Him, and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings.\"[fn-55-P5524_2168783:82-nf] All these things were not yet full and perfect in the apostle; but, as if he were placed on the way, he was running towards their fulness and perfection.

For who can delay when he would apprehend that which he declares that he is following, that he shall then have a righteousness equal to the righteousness of the holy angels, none of whom, of course, does any messenger of Satan buffet lest he should be lifted up with the greatness of his revelations? Then, admonishing those who might think themselves already perfect with the fulness of that righteousness, he says, \"Let as many of us, therefore, as are perfect, be thus minded.\"[fn-55-P5535_2173082:90-nf] As if he should say, If, according to the capacity of mortal man for the little measure of this life, we are perfect, let us understand that it also belongs to that perfection that we perceive that we are not yet perfected in that angelical righteousness which we shall have in the manifestation of Christ. \"And if in anything,\" he said, \"ye be otherwise minded, God shall also reveal even this unto you.\"[fn-55-P5536_2173508:91-nf] How, save to those that are walking and advancing in the way of the faith, until that wandering be finished and they come to the actual vision?

But the righteousness according to which the righteous man lives by faith, since man has it from God by the Spirit of grace, is true righteousness. And although this is not undeservedly said to be perfect in some righteous men, according to the capacity of this life, yet it is but little to that great righteousness which the equality of the angels receives.

But even the creature does not desire in such wise to be praised as to be unwilling to be healed. And the more marriage is to be praised, the less is to be attributed to it the shameful concupiscence of the flesh, which is not of the Father, but of the world; and which assuredly marriage found and did not make in men; because, moreover, it is actually in very many without marriage, and if nobody had sinned marriage itself might be without it. And the law, holy and just and good, is neither grace itself, nor is anything rightly done by it without grace; because the law is not given that it may give life, but it was added because of transgression, that it might conclude all persons convicted under sin, and that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.[fn-55-P5547_2179308:96-nf] And the free will taken captive does not avail, except for sin; but for righteousness, unless divinely set free and aided, it does not avail.

Because the voice, even of those earlier ones, is, \"In the Lord shall my soul be praised.\"[fn-55-P5548_2179788:97-nf] And the voice of the later ones is, \"By the grace of God I am what I am.\"[fn-55-P5549_2179881:98-nf] And to all belongs, \"That he that glorieth may glory in the Lord.\" And it is the common confession of all, \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\"[fn-55-P5550_2180091:99-nf] ","index":"76","references":[{"fn":"55","code":"P5547_2179308","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Gal. iii. 22.","bible_refs":[{"book":"galatians","chapter":3,"verses":[22]}]},{"fn":"55","code":"P5548_2179788","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Ps. xxxiv. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":34,"verses":[2]}]},{"fn":"55","code":"P5549_2179881","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 Cor. xv. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":15,"verses":[10]}]},{"fn":"55","code":"P5550_2180091","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 John i. 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 john","chapter":1,"verses":[8]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 25 [IX.]-He Shows that the Opinion of the Catholics is the Mean Between that of the Manicheans and Pelagians, and Refutes Both.","index":27,"paragraphs":[{"text":"But since, in these five particulars which I have set forth, in which they seek lurking-places, and from which they weave misrepresentations, they are forsaken and convicted by the divine writings, they have thought to deter those whom they could by the hateful name of Manicheans, lest in opposition to their most perverse teachings their ears should be conformed to the truth; because doubtless the Manicheans blasphemously condemn the three former of those five dogmas, saying that neither the human creature, nor marriage, nor the law was ordained by the supreme and true God. But they do not receive what the truth says, that sin took its origin from free will, and that all evil, whether of angel or man, comes from it; because they prefer to believe, in their turning aside from God, that the nature of evil was always evil, and co-eternal with God. They, moreover, attack the holy patriarchs and prophets with as many execrations as they can. This is the way in which the modern heretics think, that by objecting the name of Manicheans, they evade the force of truth. But they do not evade it; because it follows them up, and overturns at once Manicheans and Pelagians. For in that when a man is born there is something good, so far as he is a man, he condemns the Manichean, and praises the Creator; but in so far as he derives original sin, he condemns the Pelagian, and holds a Saviour necessary. For even because that nature is said to be healable, it repels both teachings; because it would not, on the one hand, have need of medicine if it were sound, which is opposed to the Pelagian, nor could it be healed at all if the evil in it were eternal and immutable, which is opposed to the Manichean. Moreover, in that to marriage, which we praise as ordained of God, we do not say that the concupiscence of the flesh is to be attributed, this is both contrary to the Pelagians,who make this concupiscence itself a matter of praise, and contrary to the Manicheans, who attribute it to a foreign and evil nature, when it really is an evil accidental to our nature, not to be separated by the disjunction from God, but to be healed by the mercy of God. Moreover, in that we say that the law, holy and just and good, was given not for the justification of the wicked, but for the conviction of the proud, for the sake of transgressions,-this is, on the one hand, opposed to the Manicheans, in that according to the apostle the law is praised; and on the other opposed to the Pelagians, in that, in accordance with the apostle, no one is justified by the law; and therefore, for the sake of making alive those whom the letter has killed,that is, whom the law, enjoining good, makes guilty by transgressions, the Spirit of grace freelybrings aid. Also in that we say that the will is free in evil, but for doing good it must be made free by God's grace, this is opposed to the Pelagians; but in that we say it originated from that which previously was not evil, this is opposed to the Manicheans. Again, that we honour the holy patriarchs and prophets with praises due to them in God, is in opposition to the Manicheans; but that we say that even to them, however righteous and pleasing to God they might have been, the propitiation of the Lord was necessary, this is in opposition to the Pelagians. The catholic faith, therefore, finds them both, as it does also Other heretics, in opposition to it, and convicts both by the authority of the divine testimonies and by the light of truth.","index":"78","references":[]}]},{"name":"Chapter 26 [X.]-The Pelagians Still Strive After a Hiding-Place, by Introducing the Needless Question of the Origin of the Soul.","index":28,"paragraphs":[{"text":"The Pelagians, indeed, add to the clouds which envelop their lurking-places the unnecessary question concerning the origin of the soul, for the purpose of erecting a hiding-place by disturbing manifest things by the obscurity of other matters. For they say \"that we guard the continuous propagation of souls with the continuous propagation of sin.\" And where and when they have read this, either in the addressesor in the writings of those who maintain the catholic faith against this, I do not know; because, although I find something written by catholics on the subject, yet the defence of the truth had not yet been undertaken against those men, neither was there any anxiety to answer them. But this I say, that according to the Holy Scriptures original sin is so manifest, and that this is put away in infants by the laver of regeneration is confirmed by such antiquity and authority of the catholic faith, notorious by such a clear concurrent testimony of the Church, that what is argued by the inquiry or affirmation of anybody concerning the origin of the soul, if it is contrary to this, cannot be true. Wherefore, whoever builds up, either concerning the soul orany other obscure matter, any edifice whence he may destroy this, which is true, best founded, I and best known, whether he is a son or an enemy of the Church, must either be corrected or avoid ed. But let this be the end of this Book, that the things which follow may have another beginning.
