He teaches that the grace of God by Jesus Christ is that by which alone men are delivered from evil, and without which they do absolutely no good; and this not only by the fact that it points out what is to be done, but that it also supplies the means of doing it with loved since God bestows on men the inspiration of a good will and deed. He teaches that the rebuke of evil men who have not received this grace is neither unjust-Since they are evil by their own will-Nor useless, although it must be confessed that it is only by God's agency that it can avail. That perseverance in good is truly a great gift of God, but that still the rebuke of one who has not persevered must not on that account be neglected; and that if a man who has not received this gift should relapse of his own will into sin, he is not only deserving of rebuke, but if he should continue in evil until his death, he is moreover worthy of eternal damnation. That it is inscrutable why one should receive this gift and another should not receive it. That of those who are predestinated none can perish. And that the perseverance, which all do not receive who are here called children of God, is constantly given to all those who are truly children by God's foreknowledge and predestination. He answers the question which suggests itself concerning Adam-In what way he sinned by not persevering, since he did not receive perseverance. He shows that such assistance was at the first given to him, as that without it he could not continue if he would, not as that with it it must result that he would. But that now through Christ is given us not only such help as that without it we cannot continue even if we will, but moreover such and so great as that by it we will. He proves that the number of the predestinated, to whom a gift of this kind is appropriated, is certain, and can neither be increased nor diminished. And since it is unknown who belongs to that number, and who does not, that medicinal rebuke must be applied to all who sin, lest they should either themselves perish, or be the ruin of others. Finally, he concludes that neither is rebuke prohibited by grace, nor is grace denied by rebuke.","index":"56","references":[]}]},{"name":"Chapter 1 [I.]-Introductory.","index":3,"paragraphs":[{"text":"I Have read your letter-Valentine, my dearly beloved brother, and you who are associated with him in the service of God-which your Love sent by brother Florus and those who came to us with him; and I gave God thanks that I have known your peace in the Lord and agreement in the truth and ardour in love, by your discourse delivered to us.

For it is your fault that you are evil; and it is a greater fault to be unwilling to be rebuked because you are evil, as if faults should either be praised, or regarded with indifference so as neither to be praised nor blamed, or as if, indeed, the dread, or the shame or the mortification of the rebuked man were of no avail, or were of any other avail in healthfully stimulating, except to cause that He who is good may be besought, and so out of evil men who are rebuked may make good men who may be praised. For what he who will not be rebuked desires to be done for him, when he says, \"Pray for me rather,\"-he must be rebuked for that very reason that he may himself also do for himself; because that mortification with which he is dissatisfied with himself when he feels the sting of rebuke, stirs him up to a desire for more earnest prayer,[fn-63-P6367_2438488:26-nf] that, by God's mercy, he may be aided by the increase of love, and cease to do things which are shameful and mortifying, and do things praiseworthy and gladdening.

For what man is shown to have prayed for Peter, that God should give him the repentance wherewith he bewailed the denial of his Lord? What man instructed Paul in the divine precepts which pertain to the Christian faith?

And as we are not to cease from prayer on behalf of those whom we desire to be corrected,-even although without any man's prayer on behalf of Peter, the Lord looked upon him and caused him to bewail his sin,-so we must not neglect rebuke, although God can make those whom He will to be corrected, even when not rebuked.

Is, then, that depravity not to be rebuked in a man because it is not peculiar to him who is rebuked, but is common to all? Nay, let that also be rebuked in individuals, which is common to all. For the circumstance that none is altogether free from it is no reason why it should not attach to each man.

If, however, being already regenerate and justified, he relapses of his own will into an evil life, assuredly he cannot say, \"I have not received,\" because of his own free choice to evil he has lost the grace of God, that he had received. And if, stung with compunction by rebuke, he wholesomely bewails, and returns to similar good works, or even better, certainly here most manifestly appears the advantage of rebuke.

Then when the apostle says, \"Now we pray to God that ye do no evil,\"[fn-63-P6390_2446483:40-nf] beyond a doubt he prays to God on their behalf for perseverance. For certainly he does not \"do no evil\" who forsakes good, and, not persevering in good, turns to the evil, from which he ought to turn aside.[fn-63-P6391_2446711:41-nf] In that place, moreover, where he says, \"I thank my God in every remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine for you all making quest with joy for your fellowship[fn-63-P6392_2447232:42-nf] in the gospel from the first day until now, being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ,\"[fn-63-P6393_2447438:43-nf] -what else does he promise to them from the mercy of God than perseverance in good to the end? And again where he says, \"Epaphras saluteth you, who is one of you, a servant ofChrist Jesus, always striving for you in prayer, that you may stand perfect and fulfilled in all the will of God,\"[fn-63-P6394_2447753:44-nf] -what is \"that you may stand\" but \"that you may persevere\"? Whence it was said of the devil, \"He stood not in the truth;\"[fn-63-P6395_2447893:45-nf] because he was there, but he did not continue. For assuredly those were already standing in the faith. And when we pray that he who stands may stand, we do not pray for anything else than that he may persevere. Jude the apostle, again, when he says, \"Now unto Him that is able to keep you without offence, and to establish you before the presence of His glory, immaculate in joy,\"[fn-63-P6396_2448294:46-nf] does he not most manifestly show that perseverance in good unto the end is God's gift? For what but a good perseverance does He give who preserves without offence that He may place before the presence of His glory immaculate in joy? What is it, moreover, that we read in the Acts of the Apostles: \"And when the Gentiles heard, they rejoiced and received the word of the Lord; and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed\"?[fn-63-P6397_2448741:47-nf] Who could be ordained to eternal life save by the gift of perseverance? And when we read, \"He that shall persevere unto the end shall be saved;\"[fn-63-P6398_2448906:48-nf] with what salvation but eternal? And when, in the Lord's Prayer, we say to God the Father, \"Hallowed be Thy name,\"[fn-63-P6399_2449039:49-nf] what do we ask but that His name may be hallowed in us? And as this is already accomplished by means of the laver of regeneration, why is it daily asked by believers, except that we may persevere in that which is already done in us? For the blessed Cyprian also understands this in this manner, inasmuch as, in his exposition of the same prayer, he says: \"We say, 'Hallowed be Thy name,' not that we wish for God that He may be hallowed by our prayers, but that we ask of God that His name may be hallowed in us. But by whom is God hallowed; since He Himself hallows? Well, because He said, 'Be ye holy, since I also am holy;'[fn-64-P6400_2449684:50-nf] we ask and entreat that we who have been hallowed in baptism may persevere in that which we have begun to be.\"[fn-64-P6401_2449838:51-nf] Behold the most glorious martyr is of this opinion, that what in these words Christ's faithful people are daily asking is, that they may persevere in that which they have begun to be. And no one need doubt, but that whosoever prays from the Lord that he may persevere in good, confesses thereby that such perseverance is His gift.","index":"76","references":[{"fn":"63","code":"P6385_2445187","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 Cor. iv. 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":4,"verses":[7]}]},{"fn":"63","code":"P6386_2445563","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Jas. i. 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"james","chapter":1,"verses":[17]}]},{"fn":"63","code":"P6387_2445756","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"2 Tim. ii. 25.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 timothy","chapter":2,"verses":[25]}]},{"fn":"63","code":"P6388_2445986","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"2 Tim. ii. 25.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 timothy","chapter":2,"verses":[25]}]},{"fn":"63","code":"P6389_2446246","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Luke xxii. 32.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":22,"verses":[32]}]},{"fn":"63","code":"P6390_2446483","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"2 Cor. xiii. 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":13,"verses":[7]}]},{"fn":"63","code":"P6391_2446711","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"The editors have without reason inserted a \"not\" before \"ought\" in this sentence, yielding the sense: \"who forsakes good, even that from which he ought not to turn away;\" Erasmus changes the place of \"and,\" reading: \"who forsakes good from which he ought not to turn aside, and is inclined to evil.\" \"The Ms. text is entirely satisfactory.\"-W.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"63","code":"P6392_2447232","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Many Mss. read \"communication.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"63","code":"P6393_2447438","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Phil. i. 3, et seq.","bible_refs":[{"book":"philippians","chapter":1,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"63","code":"P6394_2447753","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Col. iv. 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"colossians","chapter":4,"verses":[12]}]},{"fn":"63","code":"P6395_2447893","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"John viii. 24.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":8,"verses":[24]}]},{"fn":"63","code":"P6396_2448294","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Jude 24.","bible_refs":[{"book":"jude","chapter":1,"verses":[24]}]},{"fn":"63","code":"P6397_2448741","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Acts xiii. 48.","bible_refs":[{"book":"the acts","chapter":13,"verses":[48]}]},{"fn":"63","code":"P6398_2448906","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Matt. x. 22.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":10,"verses":[22]}]},{"fn":"63","code":"P6399_2449039","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Matt. vi. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":6,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"64","code":"P6400_2449684","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Nearly all Mss.: \"even as I am holy.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"64","code":"P6401_2449838","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Cyprian, Treatise on the Lord's Prayer, ch. 12; see The Ante-Nicene Fathers, vol. v. p. 450.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 11 [VII.]-They Who Have Not Received the Gift of Perseverance, and Have Relapsed into Mortal Sin and Have Died Therein, Must Righteously Be Condemned.","index":13,"paragraphs":[{"text":"If, then, these things be so, we still rebuke those, and reasonably rebuke them, who, although they were living well, have not persevered therein; because they have of their own will been changed from a good to an evil life, and on that account are worthy of rebuke; and if rebuke should be of no avail to them, and they should persevere in their ruined life until death, they are also worthy of divine condemnation for ever.

He could therefore continue if he would, because the help was not wanting whereby he could, and without which he could not, perseveringly hold fast the good which he would. But that he willed not to continue is absolutely the fault of him whose merit it would have been if he had willed to continue; as the holy angels did, who, while others fell by free will, themselves by the same free will stood, and deserved to receive the due reward of this continuance-to wit, such a fulness of blessing that by it they might have the fullest certainty of always abiding in it. If, however, this help had been wanting, either to angel or to man when they were first made, since their nature was not made such that without the divine help it could abide if it would, they certainly would not have fallen by their own fault, because the help would have been wanting without which they could not continue. At the present time, however, to those to whom such assistance is wanting, it is the penalty of sin; but to those to whom it is given, it is given of grace, not of debt; and by so much the more is given through Jesus Christ our Lord to those to whom it has pleased God to give it, that not only we have that help without which we cannot continue even if we will, but, moreover, we have so great and such a help as to will. Because by this grace of God there is caused in us, in the reception of good and in the persevering hold of it, not only to be able to do what we will, but even to will to do what we are able. But this was not the case in the first man; for the one of these things was in him, but the other was not. For he did not need grace to receive good, because he had not yet lost it; but he needed the aid of grace to continue in it, and without this aid he could not do this at all; and he had received the ability if he would, but he had not the will for what he could; for if he had possessed it, he would have persevered. For he could persevere if he would; but that he would not was the result of free will, which at that time was in such wise free that he was capable of willing well and ill.

The aid without which a thing does not come to pass is one thing, and the aid by which a thing comes to pass is another. For without food we cannot live; and yet although food should be at hand, it would not cause a man to live who should will to die. Therefore the aid of food is that without which it does not come to pass that we live, not that by which it comes to pass that we live. But, indeed, when the blessedness which a man has not is given him, he becomes at once blessed. For the aid is not only that without which that does not happen, but also with which that does happen for the sake of which it is given. Wherefore this is an assistance both by which it comes to pass, and without which it does not come to pass; because, on the one hand, if blessedness should be given to a man, he becomes at once blessed; and, on the other, if it should never be given he will never be so. But food does not of necessity cause a man to live, and yet without it he cannot live. Therefore to the first man, who, in that good in which he had been made upright, had received the ability not to sin, the ability not to die, the ability not to forsake that good itself, was given the aid of perseverance,-not that by which it should be brought about that he should persevere, but that without which he could not of free will persevere. But now to the saints predestinated to the kingdom of God by God's grace, the aid of perseverance that is given is not such as the former, but such that to them perseverance itself is bestowed; not only so that without that gift they cannot persevere, but, moreover, so that by means of this gift they cannot help persevering. For not only did He say, \"Without me ye can do nothing,\"[fn-65-P6543_2501473:121-nf] but He also said, \"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain.\"[fn-65-P6544_2501651:122-nf] By which words He showed that He had given them not only righteousness, but perseverance therein.

Who would dare to say, Perchance it will not remain? \"For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance;\"[fn-65-P6545_2502040:123-nf] but the calling is of those who are called according to the purpose.

Because by the Holy Spirit their will is so much enkindled that they therefore can, because they so will; and they therefore so will because God works in them to will.

Certainly to the strongest He yielded and permitted to do what He willed; to those that were weak He has reserved that by His own gift they should most invincibly will what is good, and most invincibly refuse to forsake this.

For we need not fear lest we should lose it, if in our ignorance he to whom we preach is not a son of peace, for it will return to us again-that is, that preaching will profit us, and not him; but if the peace proclaimed shall rest upon him, it will profit both us and him.","index":"148","references":[{"fn":"66","code":"P6622_2525881","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Query, Excommunication?","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"66","code":"P6623_2527116","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. v. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":5,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"66","code":"P6624_2527337","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"2 Cor. v. 20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":5,"verses":[20]}]},{"fn":"66","code":"P6625_2527692","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Luke x. 5, 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":10,"verses":[5]}]},{"fn":"66","code":"P6626_2527865","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Isa. lii. 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":52,"verses":[7]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 47.-Another Interpretation of the Apostolic Passage, \"Who Will Have All Men to Be Saved.\"","index":49,"paragraphs":[{"text":"That, therefore, in our ignorance of who shall be saved, God commands us to will that all to whom we preach this peace may be saved, and Himself works this in us by diffusing that love in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who is given to us,-may also thus be understood, that God wills all men to be saved, because He makes us to will this; just as \"He sent the Spirit of His Son, crying, Abba, Father;\"[fn-66-P6630_2529239:169-nf] that is, making us to cry, Abba, Father.

If he whom we rebuke is a son of peace, our peace shall rest upon him; but if not, it shall return to us again.","index":"150","references":[{"fn":"66","code":"P6630_2529239","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Gal. iv. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"galatians","chapter":4,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"66","code":"P6631_2529437","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. viii. 15.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":8,"verses":[15]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 48.-The Purpose of Rebuke.","index":50,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Although, therefore, even while the faith of some is subverted, the foundation of God standeth sure, since the Lord knoweth them that are His, still, we ought not on that account to be indolent and negligent in rebuking those who should be rebuked.

What is that to us? The foundation of God standeth sure, and no one perishes but the son of perdition.\" [XVI.] Be it far from us to babble in this wise, and think that we ought to be secure in this negligence. For it is true that no one perishes except the son of perdition, but God says by the mouth of the prophet Ezekiel:[fn-66-P6637_2530982:173-nf] \"He shall surely die in his sin, but his blood will I require at the hand of the watchman.\"","index":"152","references":[{"fn":"66","code":"P6635_2530343","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 Cor. xv. 33.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":15,"verses":[33]}]},{"fn":"66","code":"P6636_2530452","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 Cor. viii. 11","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":8,"verses":[11]}]},{"fn":"66","code":"P6637_2530982","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Ezek. iii. 18.","bible_refs":[{"book":"ezekiel","chapter":3,"verses":[18]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 49.-Conclusion.","index":51,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Hence, as far as concerns us, who are not able to distinguish those who are predestinated from those who are not, we ought on this very account to will all men to be saved. Severe rebuke should be medicinally applied to all by us that they perish not themselves, or that they may not be the means of destroying others. It belongs to God, however, to make that rebuke useful to them whom He Himself has foreknown and predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son. For, if at any time we abstain from rebuking, for fear lest by rebuke a man should perish, why do we not also rebuke, for fear lest a man should rather perish by our withholding it? For we have no greater bowels of love than the blessed apostle who says, \"Rebuke those that are unruly; comfort the feeble-minded; support the weak; be patient towards all men. See that none render to any man evil for evil\"[fn-66-P6641_2531995:174-nf] Where it is to be understood that evil is then rather rendered for evil when one who ought to be rebuked is not rebuked, but by a wicked dissimulation is neglected. He says, moreover, \"Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear;\"[fn-66-P6642_2532264:175-nf] which must be received concerning those sins which are not concealed, lest he be thought to have spoken in opposition to the word of the Lord. For He says, \"If thy brother shall sin against thee, rebuke him between thee and him.\"[fn-66-P6643_2532515:176-nf] Notwithstanding, He Himself carries out the severity of rebuke to the extent of saying, \"If he will not hear the Church, let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a publican.\"[fn-66-P6644_2532715:177-nf] And who has more loved the weak than He who became weak for us all, and of that very weakness was crucified for us all? And since these things are so, grace neither restrains rebuke, nor does rebuke restrain grace; and on this account righteousness is so to be prescribed that we may ask in faithful prayer, that, by God's grace, what is prescribed may be done; and both of these things are in such wise to be done that righteous rebuke may not be neglected. But let all these things be done with love, since love both does not sin, and does cover the multitude of sins.
