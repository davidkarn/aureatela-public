Augustin first refutes the several propositions in brief answers, showing that the perfect and plenary state of righteousness, in which a man exists absolutely without sin, is unattainable without grace by the mere resources of our corrupt nature, and never occurs in this present state of existence. He next proceeds to consider the authorities which the paper contained as gathered out of the scriptures; some of them teaching man to be \"unspotted\" and \"perfect;\" others mentioning the commandments of God as \"not grievous;\" while others again are quoted as opposed to the authoritative passages which the Catholics were accustomed to advance against the pelagians.Augustin to his holy brethren and fellow-bishops Eutropius and Paulus.[fn-23-P2398_983113:2-nf] ","index":"53","references":[{"fn":"23","code":"P2397_982001","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"These breves definitiones, which Augustin also calls ratiocinationes, are short argumentative statements, which may be designated breviates.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"23","code":"P2398_983113","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Probably Spanish refugees; they had recently presented to Augustin a memorial against certain heresies.

But if it is impious to say this, we are driven to confess that every sin is an act, not a thing. If therefore it is an act, for this very reason, because it is an act, it can be avoided.\" Our reply is, that sin no doubt is called an act, and is such, not a thing. But likewise in the body, lameness for the same reason is an act, not a thing, since it is the foot itself, or the body, or the man who walks lame because of an injured foot, that is the thing; but still the man cannot avoid the lameness, unless his foot be cured. The same change may take place in the inward man, but it is by God's grace, through our Lord Jesus Christ. The defect itself which causes the lameness of the man is neither the foot, nor the body, nor the man, nor indeed the lameness itself; for there is of course no lameness when there is no walking, although there is nevertheless the defect which causes the lameness whenever there is an attempt to walk. Let him therefore ask, what name must be given to this defect,-would he have it called a thing, or an act, or rather a bad property[fn-24-P2421_989002:10-nf] in the thing, by which the deformed act comes into existence?

If it is by the necessity of nature, he is blameless; if by the freedom of choice, then the question arises, from whom he has received this freedom of choice. No doubt, from God. Well, but that which God bestows is certainly good. This cannot be gainsaid. On what principle, then, is a thing proved to be good, if it is more prone to evil than to good? For it is more prone to evil than to good if by means of it man can be with sin and cannot be without sin.\" The answer is this: It came by the freedom of choice that man was with sin; but a penal corruption closely followed thereon, and out of the liberty produced necessity. Hence the cry of faith to God, \"Lead Thou me out of my necessities.\"[fn-24-P2445_994561:19-nf] With these necessities upon us, we are either unable to understand what we want, or else (while having the wish) we are not strong enough to accomplish what we have come to understand.

In two, if I mistake not: if either those things are done which are forbidden, or those things are not done which are commanded. Now, it is just as certain that all things which are forbidden are able to be avoided, as it is that all things which are commanded are able to be effected. For it is vain either to forbid or to enjoin that which cannot either be guarded against or accomplished. And how shall we deny the possibility of man's being without sin, when we are compelled to admit that he can as well avoid all those things which are forbidden, as do all those which are commanded?\" My answer is, that in the Holy Scriptures there are many divine precepts, to mention the whole of which would be too laborious; but the Lord, who on earth consummated and abridged[fn-24-P2457_997628:25-nf] His word, expressly declared that the law and the prophets hung on two commandments,[fn-24-P2458_997749:26-nf] that we might understand that whatever else has been enjoined on us by God ends in these two commandments, and must be referred to them: \"Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind;\"[fn-24-P2459_998008:27-nf] and \"Thou shall love thy neighbouras thyself.\"[fn-24-P2460_998076:28-nf] \"On these two commandments,\" says He, \"hang all the law and the prophets.\"[fn-24-P2461_998173:29-nf] Whatever, therefore, we are by God's law forbidden, and whatever we are bidden to do, we are forbidden and bidden with the direct object of fulfilling these two commandments. And perhaps the general prohibition is, \"Thou shalt not covet;\"[fn-24-P2462_998433:30-nf] and the general precept, \"Thou shall love.\"[fn-24-P2463_998494:31-nf] Accordingly the Apostle Paul, in a certain place, briefly embraced the two, expressing the prohibition in these words, \"Be not conformed to this world,\"[fn-24-P2464_998665:32-nf] and the command in these, \"But be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.\"[fn-24-P2465_998763:33-nf] The former falls under the negative precept, not to covet; the latter under the positive one, to love. The one has reference to continence, the other to righteousness. The one enjoins avoidance of evil; the other, pursuit of good.

In that real beneficence in which the just man consults his neighbour's welfare, things are sometimes done which are prejudicial, although it was thought that they would be advantageous. Sometimes, too, through infirmity, when the amount of the kindness and trouble which is expended either fails short of the necessities of the objects, or is of little use under the circumstances, then there steals over us a disappointment which tarnishes that \"cheerfulness\" which secures to the \"giver\" the approbation of God.[fn-25-P2510_1011337:57-nf] This trail of sadness,however, is the greater or the less, as each man has made more or less progress in his kindly purposes.

Be perfect.'[fn-25-P2530_1016266:71-nf] Again, to the Colossians he writes: 'Warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ.'[fn-25-P2531_1016432:72-nf] And so to the Philippians: `Do all things without murmurings and disputings, that ye may be blameless, and harmless, as the immaculate sons of God.'[fn-25-P2532_1016598:73-nf] In like manner to the Ephesians he writes: `Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ; according as He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before Him.'[fn-25-P2533_1016924:74-nf] Then again to the Colossians he says in another passage: `And you, that were sometime alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath He reconciled in the body of His flesh through death; present yourselves holy and unblameable and unreprovable in His sight.'[fn-25-P2534_1017221:75-nf] In the same strain, he says to the Ephesians: `That He might present to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish.'[fn-25-P2535_1017438:76-nf] So in his first Epistle to the Corinthians he says `Be ye sober, and righteous, and sin not.'[fn-25-P2536_1017553:77-nf] So again in the Epistle of St. Peter it is written `Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end, for the grace that is offered to you: . . . as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance: but as He who hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because it is written,[fn-25-P2537_1017946:78-nf] Be ye holy; for I am holy.'[fn-25-P2538_1017992:79-nf] Whence blessed David likewise says: `O Lord, who shall sojourn in Thy tabernacle, or who shall rest on Thy holy mountain? He that walketh without blame, and worketh righteousness.'[fn-25-P2539_1018195:80-nf] And in another passage: `I shall be blameless with Him.'[fn-25-P2540_1018271:81-nf] And yet again: `Blessed are the blameless in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord.'[fn-25-P2541_1018379:82-nf] To the same effect it is written in Solomon: `The Lord loveth holy hearts, and all they that are blameless are acceptable unto Him.'\"[fn-25-P2542_1018531:83-nf] Now some of these passages exhort men who are running their course that they run perfectly; others refer to the end thereof, that men may reach forward to it as they run. He, however, is not unreasonably said to walk blamelessly, not who has already reached the end of his journey, but who is pressing on towards the end in a blameless manner, free from damnable sins, and at the same time not neglecting to cleanse by almsgiving such sins as are venial. For the way in which we walk, that is, the road by which we reach perfection, is cleansed by clean prayer. That, however, is a clean prayer in which we say in truth, \"Forgive us, as we ourselves forgive.\"[fn-25-P2543_1019210:84-nf] So that, as there is nothing censured when blame is not imputed, we may hold on our course to perfection without censure, in a word, blamelessly; and in this perfect state, when we arrive at it at last, we shall find that there is absolutely nothing which requires cleansing by forgiveness.","index":"95","references":[{"fn":"25","code":"P2526_1015706","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Deut. xviii. 13.","bible_refs":[{"book":"deuteronomy","chapter":18,"verses":[13]}]},{"fn":"25","code":"P2527_1015790","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Augustin's word is inconsummatus.

But who can be ignorant of the fact that, since the generic commandment is love (for \"the end of the commandment is love,[fn-25-P2547_1019932:85-nf] and \"love is the fulfilling of the law\"[fn-25-P2548_1019990:86-nf] ), whatever is accomplished by the operation of love, and not of fear, is not grievous? They, however, are oppressed by the commandments of God, who try to fulfil them by fearing. \"But perfect love casteth out fear;\"[fn-25-P2549_1020227:87-nf] and, in respect of the burden of the commandment, it not only takes off the pressure of its heavy weight, but it actually lifts it up as if on wings. In order, however, that this love may be possessed, even as far as it can possibly be possessed in the body of this death, the determination of will avails but little, unless it be helped by God's grace through our Lord Jesus Christ. For as it must again and again be stated, it is \"shed abroad in our hearts,\" not by our own selves, but \"by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.\"[fn-25-P2550_1020779:88-nf] And for no other reason does Holy Scripture insist on the truth that God's commandments are not grievous, than this, that the soul which finds them grievous may understand that it has not yet received those resources which make the Lord's commandments to be such as they are commended to us as being, even gentle and pleasant; and that it may pray with groaning of the will to obtain the gift of facility. For the man who says, \"Let my heart be blameless;\"[fn-25-P2551_1021252:89-nf] and, \"Order Thou my steps according to Thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me;\"[fn-25-P2552_1021369:90-nf] and, \"Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven;\"[fn-25-P2553_1021443:91-nf] and, \"Lead us not into temptation;\"[fn-25-P2554_1021498:92-nf] and other prayers of a like purport, which it would be too long to particularize, does in effect offer up a prayer for ability to keep God's commandments. Neither, indeed, on the one hand, would any injunctions be laid upon us to keep them, if our own will had nothing to do in the matter; nor, on the other hand, would there be any room for prayer, if our will were alone sufficient. God's commandments, therefore, are commended to us as being not grievous, in order that he to whom they are grievous may understand that he has not as yet received the gift which removes their grievousness; and that he may not think that he is really performing them, when he so keeps them that they are grievous to him. For it is a cheerful giver whom God loves.[fn-25-P2555_1022266:93-nf] Nevertheless, when a man finds God's commandments grievous, let him not be broken down by despair; let him rather oblige himself to seek, to ask, and to knock","index":"97","references":[{"fn":"25","code":"P2547_1019932","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 Tim. i. 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 timothy","chapter":1,"verses":[8]}]},{"fn":"25","code":"P2548_1019990","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. xiii. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":13,"verses":[10]}]},{"fn":"25","code":"P2549_1020227","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 John iv. 18.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 john","chapter":4,"verses":[18]}]},{"fn":"25","code":"P2550_1020779","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. v. 5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":5,"verses":[5]}]},{"fn":"25","code":"P2551_1021252","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Ps. cxix. 80.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":119,"verses":[80]}]},{"fn":"25","code":"P2552_1021369","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Ps. cxix. 133.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":119,"verses":[133]}]},{"fn":"25","code":"P2553_1021443","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Matt. vi. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":6,"verses":[10]}]},{"fn":"25","code":"P2554_1021498","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Matt. vi. 13.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":6,"verses":[13]}]},{"fn":"25","code":"P2555_1022266","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"2 Cor. ix. 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":9,"verses":[7]}]}]},{"text":"\n(22.)

For this command, which I give thee this day, is not grievous, neither is it far from thee: it is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who will ascend into heaven, and obtain it for us, that we may hear and do it? neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who will cross over the sea, and obtain it for us, that we may hear and do it? The word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thine heart, and in thine hands to do it.'[fn-25-P2559_1023542:94-nf] In the Gospel likewise the Lord says: `Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.

On this principle the apostle says: \"The good that I would I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do.\"[fn-25-P2597_1031693:116-nf] Now it is a good thing to avoid concupiscence, and this good the just man would, who lives by faith;[fn-25-P2598_1031815:117-nf] and still he does what he hates, because he has concupiscence, although \"he goes not after his lusts;\"[fn-25-P2599_1031937:118-nf] if he has done this, he has himself at that time really done it, so as to yield to, and acquiesce in, and obey the desire of sin. His heart then reproaches him, because it reproaches himself, and not his sin which dwelleth in him. But whensoever he suffers not sin to reign in his mortal body to obey it in the lusts thereof,[fn-26-P2600_1032289:119-nf] and yields not his members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin,[fn-26-P2601_1032380:120-nf] sin no doubt is present in his members, but it does not reign, because its desires are not obeyed. Therefore, while he does that which he would not,- in other words, while he wishes not to lust, but still lusts,-he consents to the law that it is good:[fn-26-P2602_1032652:121-nf] for what the law would, that he also wishes; because it is his desire not to indulge concupiscence, and the law expressly says, \"Thou shalt not covet.\"[fn-26-P2603_1032825:122-nf] Now in that he wishes what the law also would have done, he no doubt consents to the law: but still he lusts, because he is not without sin; it is, however, no longer himself that does the thing, but the sin which dwells within him. Hence it is that \"his heart does not reproach him in all his life;\" that is, in his faith, because the just man lives by faith, so that his faith is his very life. He knows, to be sure, that in himself dwells nothing good,- even in his flesh, which is the dwelling-place of sin. By not consenting, however, to it, he lives by faith, wherewith he also calls upon God to help him in his contest against sin. Moreover, there is present to him to will that no sin at all should be in him, but then how to perfect this good is not present. It is not the mere \"doing\" of a good thing that is not present to him, but the \"perfecting\" of it. For in this, that he yields no consent, he does good; he does good again, in this, that he hates his own lust; he does good also, in this, that he does not cease to give alms; and in this, that he forgives the man who sins against him, he does good; and in this, that he asks forgiveness for his own trespasses,-sincerely avowing in his petition that he also forgives those who trespass against himself, and praying that he may not be led into temptation, but be delivered from evil,-he does good. But how to perfect the good is not present to him; it will be, however, in that final state, when the concupiscence which dwells in his members shall exist no more. His heart, therefore, does not reproach him, when it reproaches the sin which dwells in his members; nor can it reproach unbelief in him. Thus \"in all his life,\"-that is, in his faith,-he is neither reproached by his own heart, nor convinced of not being withoutsin. And Job himself acknowledges this concerning himself, when he says, \"Not one of mysins hath escaped Thee; Thou hast sealed upmy transgressions in a bag, and marked if I havedone iniquity unawares.\"[fn-26-P2604_1034840:123-nf] With regard, then, to the passages which he has adduced from the book of holy Job, we have shown to the best of our ability in what sense they ought to be taken.

Just as in another passage: \"Ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord,[fn-26-P2620_1038171:133-nf] -when he said, \"Ye were darkness,\" he did not add, \"in the Lord;\" but after saving, \"Ye are now light,\" he expressly added the phrase, \"in the Lord,\" for they could not possibly be \"light\" in themselves; in order that \"he who glorieth may glory in the Lord.\"[fn-26-P2621_1038448:134-nf] The \"faultless\" ones, indeed, in the Apocalypse, are so called because \"no guile was found in their mouth.\"[fn-26-P2622_1038577:135-nf] They did not say they had no sin: if they had said this, they would deceive themselves, and the truth would not be in them;[fn-26-P2623_1038721:136-nf] and if the truth were not in them, guile and untruth would be found in their mouth. if, however, to avoid envy, they said they were not without sin, although they were sinless, then this very insincerity would be a lie, and the character given of them would be untrue: \"In their mouth was found no guile.\" Hence indeed \"they are without fault;\" for as they have forgiven those who have done them wrong, so are they purified by God's forgiveness of themselves.

This he succeeded, no doubt, in doing. It is, however, one thing for a man not to do good, and another thing not to be without sin, although he at the same time may do many good things. The passages, therefore, which he adduces are not really contrary to the statement that no person is without sin in this life. He does not, for his own part, explain in what sense it is declared that \"there is none that doeth good, no, not one.\" These are his words: \"Holy David indeed says, `Hope thou in the Lord and be doing good.'\"[fn-26-P2628_1040734:138-nf] But this is a precept, and not an accomplished fact; and such a precept as is never kept by those of whom it is said, \"There is none that doeth good, no, not one.\" He adds: \"Holy Tobit also said, `Fear not, my son, that we have to endure poverty; we shall have many blessings if we fear God, and depart from all sin, and do that which is good.'\"[fn-26-P2629_1041102:139-nf] Most true indeed it is, that man shall have many blessings when he shall have departed from all sin.

It is one thing, therefore, to depart from all sin, -a process which is even now in operation,-and another thing to have departed from all sin, which shall happen in the state of future perfection.

And every man that hath this hope towards Him purifieth himself, even as He is pure.'\"[fn-27-P2711_1059952:197-nf] And yet, notwithstanding the truth of all these passages, that also is true which he has adduced, without, however, offering any explanation of it: \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\"[fn-27-P2712_1060208:198-nf] Now it follows from the whole of this, that in so far as we are born of God we abide in Him who appeared to take away sins, that is, in Christ, and sin not,-which is simply that \"the inward man is renewed day by day;\"[fn-27-P2713_1060446:199-nf] but in so far as we are born of that man \"through whom sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men\"[fn-27-P2714_1060603:200-nf] we are not without sin, because we are not as yet free from his infirmity, until, by that renewal which takes place from day to day (for it is in accordance with this that we were born of God), that infirmity shall be wholly repaired, wherein we were born from the first than, and in which we are not without sin. While the remains of this infirmity abide in our inward man, however much they may be daily lessened in those who are advancing, \"we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us, if we say that we have no sin.\" Now, however true it is that \"whosoever sinneth hath not seen Him, nor known Him\"[fn-27-P2715_1061231:201-nf] since with that vision and knowledge, which shall be realized in actual sight, no one can in this life see and know Him; yet with that vision and knowledge which come of faith, there may be many who commit sin,-even apostates themselves,-who still have believed in Him some time or other; so that of none of these could it be said, according to the vision and knowledge which as yet come of faith, that he has neither seen Him nor known Him. But I suppose it ought to be understood that it is the renewal which awaits perfection that sees and knows Him; whereas the infirmity which is destined to waste and ruin neither sees nor knows Him. And it is owing to the remains of this infirmity, of whatever amount, which remain firm in our inward man, that \"we deceive ourselves, and have not the truth in us, when we say that we have no sin.\" Although, then, by the grace of renovation \"we are the sons of God,\" yet by reason of the remains of infirmity within us \"it doth not appear what we shall be; only we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.\" Then there shall be no more sin, because no infirmity shall any longer remain within us or without us. \"And every man that hath this hope towards Him purifieth himself, even as He is pure,\"-purifieth himself, not indeed by himself alone, but by believing in Him, and calling on Him who sanctifieth His saints; which sanctification, when perfected at last (for it is at present only advancing and growing day by day), shall take away from us for ever all the remains of our infirmity.","index":"132","references":[{"fn":"27","code":"P2707_1058941","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 John i. 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 john","chapter":1,"verses":[8]}]},{"fn":"27","code":"P2708_1059261","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 John iii. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 john","chapter":3,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"27","code":"P2709_1059420","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"l John v. 18.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":5,"verses":[18]}]},{"fn":"27","code":"P2710_1059649","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 John iii. 5, 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 john","chapter":3,"verses":[5]}]},{"fn":"27","code":"P2711_1059952","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 John iii. 2, 3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 john","chapter":3,"verses":[2]}]},{"fn":"27","code":"P2712_1060208","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 John i. 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 john","chapter":1,"verses":[8]}]},{"fn":"27","code":"P2713_1060446","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"2 Cor. iv. 16.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":4,"verses":[16]}]},{"fn":"27","code":"P2714_1060603","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. v. 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":5,"verses":[12]}]},{"fn":"27","code":"P2715_1061231","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 John iii. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 john","chapter":3,"verses":[6]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter XIX, (40.) the Ninth Passage.","index":32,"paragraphs":[{"text":"\"This passage, too,\" says he, \"is quoted by them: `It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy.'\"[fn-27-P2719_1063006:202-nf] And he observes that the answer to be given to them is derived from the same apostle's words in another passage: \"Let him do what he will.\"[fn-27-P2720_1063166:203-nf] And he adds another passage from the Epistle to Philemon, where, speaking of Onesimus, [St. Paul says]: \"`Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel.
