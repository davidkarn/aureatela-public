It was to avoid making such an admission that Coelestius refused to condemn this statement, which this man on the contrary anathematized. If, therefore, I shall show that he did not really entertain any other opinion concerning infants than that they are born without any contagion of a single sin, what difference will there remain on this question between him and Coelestius, except this, that the one is more open, the other more reserved; the one more pertinacious, the other more mendacious; or, at any rate, that the one is more candid, the other more astute? For, the one before the church of Carthage refused to condemn what he afterwards in the church at Rome publicly confessed to be a tenet of his own; at the same time professing himself \"ready to submit to correction if an error had stolen over him, considering that he was but human;\" whereas the other both condemned this dogma as being contrary to the truth lest he should himself be condemned by his catholic judges, and yet kept it in reserve for subsequent defence, so that either his condemnation was a lie, or his interpretation a trick.","index":"82","references":[]}]},{"name":"Chapter 14 [XIII.]- He Shows That, Even After the Synod of Palestine, Pelagius Held the Same Opinions as Coelestius on the Subject of Original Sin.","index":16,"paragraphs":[{"text":"I see, however, that it may be most justly demanded of me, that I do not defer my promised demonstration, that he actually entertains the same views as Coelestius. In the first book of his more recent work, written in defence of free will (which work he mentions in the letter he despatched to Rome), he says: \"Everything good, and everything evil, on account of which we are either laudable or blameworthy, is not born with us but done by us: for we are born not fully developed, but with a capacity for either conduct; and we are procreated as without virtue, so also without vice; and previous to the action of our own proper will, that alone Is in man which God has formed.\" Now you perceive that in these words of Pelagius, the dogma of both these men is contained, that infants are born without the contagion of any sin from Adam. It is therefore not astonishing that Coelestius refused to condemn such as say that Adam's sin injured only himself, and not the human race; and that infants are at their birth in the same state in which Adam was before the transgression. But it is very much to be wondered at, that Pelagius had the effrontery to anathematize these opinions. For if, as he alleges, \"evil is not born with us, and we are procreated without fault, and the only thing in man previous to the action of his own will is what God has formed,\" then of course the sin of Adam did only injure himself, inasmuch as it did not pass on to his offspring. For there is not any sin which is not an evil; or a sin that is not a fault; or else sin was created by God. But he says: \"Evil is not born with us, and we are procreated without fault; and the only thing in men at their birth is what God has formed.\" Now, since by this language he supposes it to be most true, that, according to the well-known sentence of his: \"Adam's sin was injurious to himself alone, and not to the human race,\" why did Pelagius condemn this, if it were not for the purpose of deceiving his catholic judges? By parity of reasoning, it may also be argued: \"If evil is not born with us, and if we are procreated without fault, and if the only thing found in man at the time of his birth is what God has formed,\" it follows beyond a doubt that \"infants at their birth are in the same condition that Adam was before the transgression,\" in whom no evil or fault was inherent, and in whom that alone existed which God had formed. And yet Pelagius pronounced anathema on all those persons \"who hold now, or have at any time held, that newborn babes are placed by their birth in the same state that Adam was in before the transgression,\" -in other words, are without any evil, without any fault, having that only which God had formed.

When, however, I had read his four books (from the first of which I copied the words which I have just now quoted), and discovered that he was still cherishing thoughts which were opposed to the catholic faith touching infants, I felt all the greater surprise at a mendacity which he so unblushingly maintained in a synod of the Church, and on so great a question. For if he had already written these books, how did he profess to anathematize those who had ever entertained the opinions alluded to?

This plea, however, he does not advance, not only because it is a ridiculous one, but because it cannot possibly be true; because in these very books of his he both argues against the transmission of sin from Adam to infants, and glories in the proceedings of the Synod in Palestine, where he was supposed to have sincerely anathematized such as hold the opinions in dispute, and where he, in fact, stole his acquittal by practising deceit.","index":"86","references":[{"fn":"35","code":"P3574_1369328","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"See On the Proceedings of Pelagius, ch. 24.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 16 [XV.]-Pelagius' Fraudulent and Crafty Excuses.","index":18,"paragraphs":[{"text":"For what is the significance to the matter with which we now have to do of his answers to his followers, when he tells them that \"the reason why he condemned the points which were objected against him, is because he himself maintains that primal sin was injurious not only to the first man, but to the whole human race, not by transmission, but by example;\" in other words, not because those who have been propagated from him have derived any fault from him, but because all who afterwards have sinned, have imitated him who committed the first sin?

We argued: \"If, as he seems to admit, eternal life can only accrue to them who have been baptized, it follows of course that they who die unbaptized incur everlasting death.

He says:[fn-36-P3609_1384322:23-nf] \"We hold one baptism, which we say ought to be administered in the same sacramental words in the case of infants as in the case of adults.\" He did not, however,say, \"in the same sacrament\" (although if he had so said, there would still have been ambiguity), but \"in the same sacramental words,\"-as if remission of sins in infants were declared by the sound of the words, and not wrought by the effect of the acts.

Some there were who said, \"I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me;\"[fn-36-P3643_1397870:42-nf] and, \"There is no rest in my bones, by reason of my sins;\"[fn-36-P3644_1397945:43-nf] and, \"Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit in my inward parts;\"[fn-36-P3645_1398053:44-nf] and, \"Stablish me with Thy directing Spirit;\"[fn-36-P3646_1398116:45-nf] and, \"Take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.\"[fn-36-P3647_1398174:46-nf] There were some, again, who said: \"I believed, therefore have I spoken.\"[fn-36-P3648_1398264:47-nf] For they too were cleansed with the self-same faith with which we ourselves are.

Owing, indeed, to God's justice, who punishes, this fatal flaw has so far prevailed, that men are born with the fault of original sin; but yet its influence has not extended so far as to stop the birth of men. Just so does it happen in persons of adult age: whatever sins they commit, do not eliminate his manhood from man; nay, God's work continues still good, however evil be the deeds of the impious. For although \"man being placed in honour abideth not; and being without understanding, is compared with the beasts, and is like them,\"[fn-37-P3763_1434996:111-nf] yet the resemblance is not so absolute that he becomes a beast.

For so excellent is a man in comparison with a beast, that man's vice is beast's nature; still man's nature is never on this account changed into beast's nature. God, therefore, condemns man because of the fault wherewithal his nature is disgraced, and not because of his nature, which is not destroyed in consequence of its fault. Heaven forbid that we should think beasts are obnoxious to the sentence of condemnation! It is only proper that they should be free from our misery, inasmuch as they cannot partake of our blessedness. What, then, is there surprising or unjust in man's being subjected to an impure spirit-not on account of nature, but on account of that impurity of his which he has contracted in the stain of his birth, and which proceeds, not from the divine work, but from the will of man;-since also the impure spirit itself is a good thing considered as spirit, but evil in that it is impure? For the one is of God, and is His work, while the other emanates from man's own will. The stronger nature, therefore, that is, the angelic one, keeps the lower, or human, nature in subjection, by reason of the association of vice with the latter.

In the work which the saintly Ambrose wrote, Concerning the Resurrection, he says: \"I fell in Adam, in Adam was I expelled from Paradise, in Adam I died; and He does not recall me unless He has found me in Adam,-so as that, as I am obnoxious to the guilt of sin in him, and subject to death, I may be also justified in Christ.\"[fn-37-P3769_1437614:114-nf] Then, again, writing against the Novatians, he says: \"We men are all of us born in sin; our very origin is in sin; as you may read when David says, 'Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.'[fn-37-P3770_1437873:115-nf] Hence it is that Paul's flesh is 'a body of death;'[fn-37-P3771_1437943:116-nf] even as he says himself, 'Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?' Christ's flesh, however, has condemned sin, which He experienced not by being born, and which by dying He crucified, that in our flesh there might be justification through grace, where previously there was impurity through sin.\"[fn-37-P3772_1438271:117-nf] The same holy man also, in his Exposition of Isaiah, speaking of Christ, says: \"Therefore as man He was tried in all things, and in the likeness of men He endured all things; but as born of the Spirit, He was free from sin. For every man is a liar, and no one but God alone is without sin. It is therefore an observed and settled fact, that no man born of a man and a woman, that is, by means of their bodily union, is seen to be free from sin. Whosoever, indeed, is free from sin, is free also from a conception and birth of this kind.\"[fn-37-P3773_1438853:118-nf] Moreover, when expounding the Gospel according to Luke, he says: \"It was no cohabitation with a husband which opened the secrets of the Virgin's womb; rather was it the Holy Ghost which infused immaculate seed into her unviolated womb. For the Lord Jesus alone of those who are born of woman is holy, inasmuch as He experienced not the contact of earthly corruption, by reason of the novelty of His immaculate birth; nay, He repelled it by His heavenly majesty.\"[fn-37-P3774_1439387:119-nf] ","index":"150","references":[{"fn":"37","code":"P3768_1436948","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"See above, De Gratiâ Christi, 49-51 (xlv., xlvi.).","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"37","code":"P3769_1437614","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Ambrose's De Exc.

Inasmuch, however, as the blessed Ambrose, catholic bishop as he is, has expressed himself in the above-quoted passages in accordance with the catholic faith, it follows that Pelagius, along with his disciple Coelestius, was justly condemned by the authority of the catholic Church for having turned aside from the true way of faith, since he repented not for having bestowed commendation on Ambrose, and for having at the same time entertained opinions in opposition to him.
