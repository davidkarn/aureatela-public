Wherefore if, as no one can doubt, \"the spirit is life because of righteousness,\" that is, as the desert, of righteousness; how ought we, or can we, understand by the statement, \"The body is dead because of sin,\" anything else than that the body is dead as the desert of sin, unless indeed we try to pervert or wrest the plainest sense of Scripture to our own arbitrary will?

For they are bound to remember that, although their body still bears that desert of sin, which is irrevocably bound to the condition of death, yet their spirit has already begun to live because of the righteousness of faith, although it had actually become extinct by the death, as it were, of unbelief. No small gift, therefore, he says, must you suppose to have been conferred upon you, by the circumstance that Christ is in you; inasmuch as in the body, which is dead because of sin, your spirit is even now alive because of righteousness; so that therefore you should not despair of the life even of your body. \"For if the, Spirit of Him that raised up Christ from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall quicken also your mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in you.\"[fn-3-P317_327930:22-nf] How is it that fumes of controversy still darken so clear a light?

For assuredly grace does not condone many offences, without judgment in like manner having many offences to condemn.

But this most certainly was not the apostle's meaning, when he said: \"The judgment, indeed, was from one offence unto condemnation, but the grace was from many offences unto justification.\" We on our side, indeed, can understand the apostle, and see that judgment is predicated of one offence unto condemnation entirely on the ground that, even if there were in men nothing but original sin, it would be sufficient for their condemnation. For however much heavier will be their condemnation who have added their own sins to the original offence (and it will be the more severe in individual cases, in proportion to the sins of individuals); still, even that sin alone which was originally derived unto men not only excludes from the kingdom of God, which infants are unable to enter (as they themselves allow), unless they have received the grace of Christ before they die, but also alienates from salvation and everlasting life, which cannot be anything else than the kingdom of God, to which fellowship with Christ alone introduces us.","index":"102","references":[{"fn":"3","code":"P369_341667","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"See note to last word of ch. 11.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"3","code":"P370_341883","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. v. 16.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":5,"verses":[16]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 16 [XIII.]-How Death is by One and Life by One.","index":18,"paragraphs":[{"text":"And from this we gather that we have derived from Adam, in whom we all have sinned, not all our actual sins, but only original sin; whereas from Christ, in whom we are all justified, we obtain the remission not merely of that original sin, but of the rest of our sins also, which we have added.

Again, what mean the words, \"Much more shall they reign in life,\" when the fact is, that the reign of death drags many more down to eternal punishment, unless we understand those to be really mentioned in both clauses, who pass from Adam to Christ, in other words, from death to life; because in the life eternal they shall reign without end, and thus exceed the reign of death which has prevailed within them only temporarily and with a termination?","index":"106","references":[{"fn":"3","code":"P377_344933","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. v. 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":5,"verses":[17]}]},{"fn":"3","code":"P378_346008","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"See above, ch. 9.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 18.-Only Christ Justifies.","index":20,"paragraphs":[{"text":"\"Therefore as by the offence of one upon all men to condemnation, even so by the justification of One upon all men unto justification of life.\"[fn-3-P382_347563:54-nf] This \"offence of one,\" if we are bent on \"imitation,\" can only be the devil's offence.

For although many sinners have preceded us in the time of this present life, and have been imitated in their sin by those who have sinned at a later date, yet they will have it, that only Adam is mentioned as he in whom all have sinned by imitation, since he was the first of men who sinned. And on the same principle, Abel ought certainly to have been mentioned, as he \"in which one\" all likewise are justified by imitation, inasmuch as he was himself the first man who lived justly. If, however, it be thought necessary to take into the account some critical period having relation to the beginning of the New Testament, and Christ be taken as the leader of the righteous and the object of their imitation, then Judas, who betrayed Him, ought to be set down as the leader of the class of sinners. Moreover, if Christ alone is He in whom all men are justified, on the ground that it is not simply the imitation of His example which makes men just, but His grace which regenerates men by the Spirit, then also Adam is the only one in whom all have sinned, on the ground that it is not the mere following of his evil example that makes men sinners, but the penalty which generates through the flesh. Hence the terms \"all men\" and \"all men.\" For not they who are generated through Adam are actually the very same as those who are regenerated through Christ; but yet the language of the apostle is strictly correct, because as none partakes of carnal generation except through Adam, so no one shares in the spiritual except through Christ. For if any could be generated in the flesh, yet not by Adam; and if in like manner any could be generated in the Spirit, and not by Christ; clearly \"all\" could not be spoken of either in the one class or in the other. But these \"all\"[fn-3-P391_351632:60-nf] the apostle afterwards describes as \"many;\"[fn-3-P392_351711:61-nf] for obviously, under certain circumstances, the \"all\" may be but a few. The carnal generation, however, embraces \"many,\" and the spiritual generation also includes \"many;\" although the \"many\" of the spiritual are less numerous than the \"many\" of the carnal. But as the one embraces all men whatever, so the other includes all righteous men; because as in the former case none can be a man without the carnal generation, so in the other class no one can be a righteous man without the spiritual generation; in both instances, therefore, there are\" many:\" \"For as by the disobedience of one man many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.\"[fn-3-P393_352404:62-nf] ","index":"110","references":[{"fn":"3","code":"P390_349717","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. v. 18.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":5,"verses":[18]}]},{"fn":"3","code":"P391_351632","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"The word is \"all\" in ver. 18.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"3","code":"P392_351711","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"See ver. 19.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"3","code":"P393_352404","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. v. 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":5,"verses":[19]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 20.-Original Sin Alone is Contracted by Natural Birth.","index":22,"paragraphs":[{"text":"\"Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound.\"[fn-3-P397_352542:63-nf] This addition to original sin men now made of their own wilfulness, not through Adam; but even this is done away and remedied by Christ, because \"where sin abounded, grace did much more abound; that as sin hath reigned unto death \"[fn-3-P398_352791:64-nf] -even that sin which men have not derived from Adam, but have added of their own will-\"even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life.\"[fn-3-P399_352963:65-nf] Them is, however, other righteousness apart from Christ, as there are other sins apart from Adam.

However many were the years they lived in their subsequent life, yet they began to die on the day when they received the law of death, because they kept verging towards old age.

However, let us, as I suggested, pass by such opponents as these; indeed, we require neither words nor quotations of Scripture to prove the sinlessness of infants, so far as their conduct in life is concerned; this life they spend, such is the recency of their birth, within their very selves, since it escapes the cognizance of human perception, which has no data or support whereon to sustain any controversy on the subject.","index":"116","references":[]}]},{"name":"Chapter 23 [XVIII.]-He Refutes Those Who Allege that Infants are Baptized Not for the Remission of Sins, But for the Obtaining of the Kingdom of Heaven.74","index":25,"paragraphs":[{"text":"But those persons raise a question, and appear to adduce an argument deserving of consideration and discussion, who say that new-born infants receive baptism not for the remission of sin, but that, since their procreation is not spiritual, they may be created in Christ, and become partakers of the kingdom of heaven, and by the same means children and heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ. And yet, when you ask them, whether those that are not baptized, and are not made joint-heirs with Christ and par-takers of the kingdom of heaven, have at any rate the blessing of eternal life in the resurrection of the dead, they are extremely perplexed, and find no way out of their difficulty. For what Christian is there who would allow it to be said, that any one could attain to eternal salvation without being born again in Christ,-[a result] which He meant to be effected through baptism, at the very time when such a sacrament was purposely instituted for regenerating in the hope of eternal salvation?

So much also does Scripture testify, according to the words which we already quoted. For wherein does their opinion, who designate baptism by the term salvation, differ from what is written: \"He saved us by the washing of regeneration?\"[fn-4-P481_383676:105-nf] or from Peter's statement: \"The like figure where-unto even baptism doth also now save us?\"[fn-4-P482_383788:106-nf] And what else do they say who call the sacrament of the Lord's Supper life, than that which is written: \"I am the living bread which came down from heaven;\"[fn-4-P483_383968:107-nf] and \"The bread that I shall give is my flesh, for the life of the world ;\"[fn-4-P484_384063:108-nf] and \"Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, ye shall have no life in you?\"[fn-4-P485_384183:109-nf] If, therefore, as so many and such divine witnesses agree, neither salvation nor eternal life can be hoped for by any man without baptism and the Lord's body and blood, it is vain to promise these blessings to infants without them. Moreover, if it be only sins that separate man from salvation and eternal life, there is nothing else in infants which these sacraments can be the means of removing, but the guilt of sin,-respecting which guilty nature it is written, that \"no one is clean, not even if his life be only that of a day.\"[fn-4-P486_384737:110-nf] Whence also that exclamation of the Psalmist: \"Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me!\"[fn-4-P487_384876:111-nf] This is either said in the person of our common humanity, or if of himself only David speaks, it does not imply that he was born of fornication, but in lawful wedlock.

For that such an inheritance is not bestowed upon them except through baptism, even they who hold the opinion in question do acknowledge. Then, again, if they are (though already illuminated) thus unfit for entrance into the kingdom of God, they at all events ought gladly to receive the baptism, by which they are fitted for it; but, strange to say, we see how reluctant infants are to submit to baptism, resisting even with strong crying.

So that he mentioned the inner man as coming into the world, because the outward man is of a corporeal nature, just as this world itself; as if he said, \"Which lighteth every man that cometh into the body,\" in accordance with that which is written: \"I obtained a good spirit, and I came in a body undefiled.\"[fn-5-P508_390252:120-nf] Or again, the passage, \"Which lighteth every one that cometh into the world,\"-if it was added for the sake of expressing some distinction,-might perhaps mean: Which lighteth every inner man, because the inner man, when he becomes truly wise, is enlightened only by Him who is the true Light.

When this shall have been made clear by more than sufficient evidence, it will follow that those persons cannot be concerned with that dispensation of Christ which is executed by His humiliation, who have no need of life, and salvation, and deliverance, and redemption, and illumination. And inasmuch as to this belongs baptism, in which we are buried with Christ, in order to be incorporated into Him as His members (that is, as those who believe in Him): it of course follows that baptism is unnecessary for them, who have no need of the benefit of that forgiveness and reconciliation which is acquired through a Mediator. Now, seeing that they admit the necessity of baptizing infants,-finding themselves unable to contravene that authority of the universal Church, which has been unquestionably handed down by the Lord and His apostles,-they cannot avoid the further concession, that infants require the same benefits of the Mediator, in order that, being washed by the sacrament and charity of the faithful, and thereby incorporated into the body of Christ, which is the Church, they may be reconciled to God, and so live in Him, and be saved, and delivered, and redeemed, and enlightened.

He then says: \"I will not gather their assemblies together [with their offerings] of blood;\" for by their many sacrifices of blood, when they gathered their assemblies into the tabernacle at first, and then into the temple, they were rather convicted as sinners than cleansed. I shall no longer, He says, gather their assemblies of blood-offerings together; because there is one blood-shedding given for many, whereby they may be truly cleansed. Then it follows: \"Neither will I make mention of their names with my lips,\" as if they were the names of renewed ones. For these were their names at first: children of the flesh, children of the world, children ofwrath, children of the devil, unclean, sinners, impious; but afterwards, children of God,-a new name to the new man, a new song to the singer of what is new, by means of the New Testament.

He it is that bears our weaknesses, and for us is involved in pains: and we accounted Him to be in pains, and in misfortune, and in punishment. But it was He who was wounded for our sins, was weakened for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and by His bruise we are healed. All we, as sheep, have gone astray; and the Lord delivered Him up for our sins. And although He was evilly entreated, yet He opened not His mouth: as a sheep was He led to the slaughter, and as a lamb is dumb before the shearer, so He opened not His mouth. In His humiliation His judgment was taken away: His generation who shall declare? For His life shall be taken away from the earth, and for the iniquities of my people was He led to death. Therefore I will give the wicked for His burial, and the rich for His death; because He did no iniquity, nor deceit with His mouth. The Lord is pleased to purge Him from misfortune. If you could yourselves have given your soul on account of your sins, ye should see a seed of a long life.

For this [eternal life] is ready to be revealed at the last time,[fn-6-P633_424957:194-nf] that is, at the resurrection of the dead who are reserved not for that eternal death which is called \"the second death,\" but for the eternal life which God, who cannot lie, promises to His saints and faithful servants. Now none who shall partake of this life shall be made alive except in Christ, even as all die in Adam.[fn-6-P634_425299:195-nf] For as none whatever, of all those who belong to the generation according to the will of the flesh, die except in Adam, in whom all sinned; so, out of these, none at all who are regenerated by the will of the Spirit are endowed with life except in Christ, in whom all are justified. Because as through one all to condemnation, so through One all to justification.[fn-6-P635_425685:196-nf] Nor is there any middle place for any man, and so a man can only be with the devil who is not with Christ. Accordingly, also the Lord Himself (wishing to remove from the hearts of wrong-believers[fn-6-P636_425900:197-nf] that vague and indefinite middle condition, which some would provide for unbaptized infants,-as if, by reason of their innocence, they were embraced in eternal life, but were not, because of their unbaptized state, with Christ in His kingdom) uttered that definitive sentence of His, which shuts their mouths: \"He that is not with me is against me.\"[fn-6-P637_426274:198-nf] Take then the case of any infant you please: If he is already in Christ, why is he baptized? If, however, as the Truth has it, he is baptized just that he may be with Christ, it certainly follows that he who is not baptized is not with Christ; and because he is not \"with\" Christ, he is \"against\" Christ; for He has pronounced His own sentence, whichis so explicit that we ought not, and indeed cannot, impair it or change it. And how can he be \"against\" Christ, if not owing to sin? for it cannot possibly be from his soul or his body, both of these being the creation of God. Now if it be owing to sin, what sin can be found at such an age, except the ancient and original sin? Of course that sinful flesh in which all are born to condemnation is one thing, and that Flesh which was made \"after the likeness of sinful flesh,\" whereby also all are freed from condemnation, is another thing. It is, however, by no means meant to be implied that all who are born in sinful flesh are themselves actually cleansed by that Flesh which is \"like\" sinful flesh; \"for all men have not faith;\"[fn-6-P638_427381:199-nf] but that all who are born from the carnal union are born entirely of sinful flesh, whilst all who are born from the spiritual union are cleansed only by the Flesh which is in the likeness of sinful flesh. In other words, the former class are in Adam unto condemnation, the latter are in Christ unto justification. This is as if we should say, for example, that in such a city there is a certain midwife who delivers all; and in the same place there is an expert teacher who instructs all. By all, in the one case, only those who are born can possibly be understood; by all, in the other, only those who are taught: and it does not follow that all who are born also receive the instruction. But it is obvious to every one, that in the one case it is correctly said, \"she delivers all,\" since without her aid no one is born; and in the other, it is rightly said, \"he teaches all,\" since without his tutoring, no one learns.","index":"182","references":[{"fn":"6","code":"P633_424957","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 Pet. i. 5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 peter","chapter":1,"verses":[5]}]},{"fn":"6","code":"P634_425299","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 Cor. xv. 22.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":15,"verses":[22]}]},{"fn":"6","code":"P635_425685","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. v. 18.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":5,"verses":[18]}]},{"fn":"6","code":"P636_425900","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Malè credentium.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"6","code":"P637_426274","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Matt. xii. 30.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":12,"verses":[30]}]},{"fn":"6","code":"P638_427381","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"2 Thess. iii. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 thessalonians","chapter":3,"verses":[2]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 56.-No One is Reconciled to God Except Through Christ.","index":58,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Taking into account all the inspired statements which I have quoted,-whether I regard the value of each passage one by one, or combine their united testimony in an accumulated witness or even include similar passages which I have not adduced,-there can be nothing discovered, but that which the catholic Church holds, in her dutiful vigilance against all profane novelties: that every man is separated from God, except those who are reconciled to God through Christ the Mediator; and that no one can be separated from God, except by sins, which alone cause separation; that there is, therefore, no reconciliation except by the remission of sins, through the one grace of the most merciful Saviour,-through the one sacrifice of the most veritable Priest; and that none who are born of the woman, that trusted the serpent and so was corrupted through desire,[fn-6-P642_429246:200-nf] are delivered from the body of this death, except by the Son of the virgin who believed the angel and so conceived without desire.[fn-6-P643_429397:201-nf] ","index":"184","references":[{"fn":"6","code":"P642_429246","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Gen. iii. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":3,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"6","code":"P643_429397","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Luke i. 38.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":1,"verses":[38]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 57 [XXIX.]-The Good of Marriage; Four Different Cases of the Good and the Evil Use of Matrimony.","index":59,"paragraphs":[{"text":"The good, then, of marriage lies not in the passion of desire, but in a certain legitimate and honourable measure in using that passion, appropriate to the propagation of children, not the gratification of lust.[fn-6-P647_429732:202-nf] That, therefore, which is disobediently excited in the members of the body of this death, and endeavours to draw into itself our whole fallen soul, (neither arising nor subsiding at the bidding of the mind), is that evil of sin in which every man is born. When, however, it is curbed from unlawful desires, and is permitted only for the orderly propagation and renewal of the human race, this is the good of wedlock, by which man is born in the union that is appointed. Nobody, however, is born again in Christ's body, unless he be previously born in the body of sin. But inasmuch as it is evil to make a bad use of a good thing, so is it good to use well a bad thing. These two ideas therefore of good and evil, and those other two of a good use and an evil use, when they are duly combined together, produce four different conditions:-[1] A man makes a good use of a good thing, when he dedicates his continence to God; [2.] He makes a bad use of a good thing, when he dedicates his continence to an idol;[3.] He makes a bad use of an evil thing, when he loosely gratifies his concupiscence by adultery; [4.] He makes a good use of an evil thing, when he restrains his concupiscence by matrimony.

He will in fact tell us how spiritual regeneration can come to a man who springs from carnal generation. After noticing briefly the ignorance of one who assumed a superiority over others as a teacher, and having blamed the unbelief of all such, for not accepting His witness to the truth, He went on to inquire and wonder whether, as He had told them about earthly things and they had not believed they would believe heavenly things. He nevertheless pursues the subject, and gives an answer such as others should believe-though these refuse-to the question that he was asked, How these things can be? \"No man,\" says He, \"hath ascended up to heaven, but He that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.\"[fn-6-P666_438537:212-nf] Thus, He says, shall come the spiritual birth,-men, from being earthly, shall become heavenly; and this they can only obtain by being made members of me; so that he may ascend who descended, since no one ascends who did not descend. All, therefore, who have to be changed and raised must meet together in a union with Christ, so that the Christ who descended may ascend, reckoning His body (that is to say, His Church) as nothing else than Himself, because it is of Christ and the Church that this is most truly understood: \"And they twain shall be one flesh;\"[fn-6-P667_439119:213-nf] concerning which very subject He expressly said Himself, \"So then they are no more twain, but one flesh.\"[fn-6-P668_439245:214-nf] To ascend, therefore, they would be wholly unable, since 0\"no man hath ascended up to heaven, but He that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.\"[fn-6-P669_439433:215-nf] For although it was on earth that He was made the Son of man, yet He did not deem it unworthy of that divinity, in which, although remaining in heaven, He came down to earth, to designate it by the name of the Son of man, as He dignified His flesh with the name of Son of God: that they might not be regarded as if they were two Christs,-the one God, the other man,[fn-6-P670_439820:216-nf] -but one and the same God and man,-God, because \"in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God;\"[fn-6-P671_440037:217-nf] and man, inasmuch as \"the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.\"[fn-6-P672_440122:218-nf] By this means-by the difference between His divinity and His humiliation-He remained in heaven as Son of God, and as Son of man walked on earth; whilst, by that unity of His person which made His two natures one Christ, He both walked as Son of God on earth, and at the same time as the very Son of man remained in heaven. Faith, therefore, in more credible things arises from thebelief of such things as are more incredible. For if His divine nature, though a far more distant object, and more sublime in its incomparable diversity, had ability so to take upon itself the nature of man on our account as to become one Person, and whilst appearing as Son of man on earth in the weakness of the flesh, was able to remain all the while in heaven in the divinity which partook of the flesh, how much easier for our faith is it to suppose that other men, who are His faithful saints, become one Christ with the Man Christ, so that, when all ascend by His grace and fellowship, the one Christ Himself ascends to heaven who came down from heaven?

Many were dying of the bite of serpents: the people then confessed their sins, and, through Moses, besought the Lord to take away from them this poison; accordingly, Moses, at the Lord's command, lifted up a brazen serpent in the wilderness, and admonished the people that every one who had been serpent-bitten should look upon the uplifted figure.

He adds, indeed: \"But this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men: loved darkness rather than light.[fn-6-P685_445014:225-nf] Of what does He say, \"Light is come into the world,\" if not of His own advent? and without the sacrament of His advent, how are infants said to be in the light? And why should we not include this fact also in \"men's love of darkness,\" thatas they do not themselves believe, so they refuse to think that their infants ought to be baptized, although they are afraid of their incurring the death of the body? \"In God,\" however, he declares are the \"works of him wrought, who cometh to the light,\"[fn-6-P686_445529:226-nf] because he is quite aware that his justification results from no merits of his own, but from the grace of God. \"For it is God,\" says the apostle, \"who worketh in you both to will and to do of His own good pleasure.\"[fn-6-P687_445766:227-nf] This then is the way in which spiritual regeneration is effected in all who come to Christ from their carnal generation. He explained it Himself, and pointed it out, when He was asked, How these things could be? He left it open to no man to settle such a question by human reasoning, lest infants should be deprived of the grace of the remission of sins. There is no other passage leading to Christ; no man can be reconciled to God, or can come to God otherwise, than through Christ.","index":"196","references":[{"fn":"6","code":"P683_443860","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"John iii. 16.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":3,"verses":[16]}]},{"fn":"6","code":"P684_444388","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"John iii 18.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"6","code":"P685_445014","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"John iii. 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":3,"verses":[19]}]},{"fn":"6","code":"P686_445529","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"John iii. 21.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":3,"verses":[21]}]},{"fn":"6","code":"P687_445766","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Phil. ii. 13.","bible_refs":[{"book":"philippians","chapter":2,"verses":[13]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 63 [XXXIV.]-The Form, or Rite, of Baptism.

The man who brought the infant would certainly have had to act as sponsor for him, for he could not answer for himself. How would it be possible then for him to declare that he renounced the devil, if there was no devil in him? that he was converted to God, if he had never been averted from Him? that he believed, besides other articles, in the forgiveness of sins, if no sins were attributable to him? For my own part, indeed, if I thought that his opinions were opposed to this faith, I could not permit him to bring the infant to the sacraments. Nor can I imagine with what countenance before men, or what mind before God, he can conduct himself in this. But I do not wish to say anything too severe. That a false or fallacious form of baptism should be administered to infants, in which there might be the sound and semblance of something being done, but yet no remission of sins actually ensue, has been seen by some amongst them to be as abominable and hateful a thing as it was possible to mention or conceive. Then, again, in respect of the necessity of baptism to infants, they admit that even infants stand in need of redemption,-a concession which is made in a short treatise written by one of their party,-but yet there is not found in this work any open admission of the forgiveness of a single sin. According, however, to an intimation dropped in your letter to me, they now acknowledge, as you say, that a remission of sins takes place even in infants through baptism.

The latter class, indeed, by examining the Scriptures, and considering the authority of the whole Church as well as the form of the sacrament itself, have clearly seen that by baptism remission of sins accrues to infants; but they are either unwilling or unable to allow that the sin which infants have is original sin. The former class, however, have clearly seen (as they easily might) that in the very nature of man, which is open to the consideration of all men, the tender age of which we speak could not possibly commit any sin whatever in its own proper conduct; but, to avoid acknowledging original sin, they assert that there is no sin at all in infants. Now in the truths which they thus severally maintain, it so happens that they first of all mutually agree with each other, and subsequently differ from us in material aspect. For if the one party concede to the other that remission of sins takes place in all infants which are baptized, whilst the other concedes to their opponents that infants (as infant nature itself in its silence loudly proclaims) have as yet contracted no sin in their own living, then both sides must agree in conceding to us, that nothing remains but original sin, which can be remitted in baptism to infants.","index":"200","references":[]}]},{"name":"Chapter 65 [XXXV.]-In Infants There is No Sin of Their Own Commission.","index":67,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Will this also be questioned, and must we spend time in discussing it, in order to prove and show how that by their own will-without which there can be no sin in their own life-infants could never commit an offence, whom all, for this very reason, are in the habit of calling innocent?

If it should happen to cry and to be wearisome to its elders, I wonder whether my informant would ascribe this to iniquity, and not rather to unhappiness. What, too, would he say to the fact that it is hushed from its very weeping by no appeal to its own reason, and by no prohibition of any one else? This, however, comes from the ignorance in which it is so deeply steeped, by reason of which, too, when it grows stronger, as it very soon does, it strikes its mother in its little passion, and often her very breasts which it sucks when it is hungry. Well, now, these small freaks are not only borne in very young children, but are actually loved,-and this with what affection except that of the flesh,[fn-7-P700_452187:228-nf] by which we are delighted by a laugh or a joke, seasoned with fun and nonsense by clever persons, although, if it were understood literally, as it is spoken, they would not be laughed with as facetious, but at as simpletons? We see, also, how those simpletons whom the common people call <\\i>moriones[fn-7-P701_452503:229-nf] are used for the amusement of the sane; and that they fetch higher prices than the sane when appraised for the slave market. So great, then, is the influence of mere natural feeling, even over those who are by no means simpletons, in producing amusement at another's misfortune. Now, although a man may be amused by another man's silliness, he would still dislike to be a simpleton himself; and if the father, who gladly enough looks out for, and even provokes, such things from his own prattling boy, were to foreknow that he would, when grown up, turn out a fool, he would without doubt think him more to be grieved for than if he were dead. While, however, hope remains of growth, and the light of intellect is expected to increase with the increase of years, then the insults of young children even to their parents seem not merely not wrong, but even agreeable andpleasant. No prudent man, doubtless, could possibly approve of not only not forbidding in children such conduct in word or deed as this,as soon as they are able to be forbidden, buteven of exciting them to it, for the vain amuse. ment of their elders. For as soon as children are of an age to know their father and mother, they dare not use wrong words to either, unless permitted or bidden by either, or both. But such things can only belong to such young children as are just striving to lisp out words, and whose minds are just able to give some sort of motion to their tongue.

Let those say so who dare; let them listen to it who wish to; let them believe it who can. I, however, am sure that none whose minds are not blinded by an obstinate adherence to a foregone conclusion can possibly entertain such an opinion. Is there then no evil in ignorance,-nothing which needs to be purged away? What means that prayer \"Remember not the sins of my youth and of my ignorance?\"[fn-7-P705_455130:230-nf] For although those sins are more to be condemned which are knowingly committed, yet if there were no sins of ignorance, we should not have read in Scripture what I have quoted, \"Remember not the sins of my youth and of my ignorance.\" Seeing now that the soul of an infant fresh from its mother's womb is still the soul of a human being,-nay, the soul of a rational creature,-not only untaught, but even incapable of instruction, I ask why, or when, or whence, it was plunged into that thick darkness of ignorance in which it lies? If it is man's nature thus to begin, and that nature is not already corrupt, then why was not Adam created thus? Why was he capable of receiving a commandment? and able to give names to his wife, and to all the animal creation?

To this question our answer is as follows: Adam was not created in such a state, because, as no sin from a parent preceded him, he was not created in sinful flesh. We, however, are in such a condition, because by reason of his preceding sin we are born in sinful flesh. While Christ was born in such a state, because, in order that He might for sin condemn sin, He assumed the likeness of sinful flesh.[fn-7-P711_457955:233-nf] The question which we are now discussing is not about Adam in respect of the size of his body, why he was not made an infant but in the perfect greatness of his members. It mayindeed be said that the beasts were thus created likewise,-nor was it owing to their sin that their young were born small. Why all this came to pass we are not now asking. But the question before us has regard to the vigor of man's mind and his use of reason, by virtue of which Adam was capable of instruction, and could apprehend God's precept and the law of His commandment, and could easily keep it if he would; whereas man is now born in such a state as to be utterly incapable of doing so, owing to his dreadful ignorance and weakness, not indeed of body, but of mind,-although we must all admit that in every infant there exists a rational soul of the self-same substance (and no other) as that which belonged to the first man. Still this great infirmity of the flesh, clearly, in my opinion, points to a something, whatever it may be, that is penal. It raises the doubt whether, if the first human beings had not sinned, they would have had children who could use neither tongue, nor hands, nor feet. That they should be born children was perhaps necessary, on account of the limited capacity of the womb. But, at the same time, it does not follow, because a rib is a small part of a man's body, that God made an infant wife for the man, and then built her up into a woman. In like manner, God's almighty power was competent to make her children also, as soon as born, grown up at once.","index":"208","references":[{"fn":"7","code":"P711_457955","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. viii. 3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":8,"verses":[3]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 69 [XXXVIII.]-The Ignorance and the Infirmity of an Infant.","index":71,"paragraphs":[{"text":"But not to dwell on this, that was at least possible to them which has actually happened to many animals, the young of which are born small, and do not advance in mind (since they have no rational soul) as their bodies grow larger, and yet, even when most diminutive, run about, and recognize their mothers, and require no external help or care when they want to suck, but with remarkable ease discover their mothers' breasts themselves, although these are concealed from ordinary sight. A human being, on the contrary, at his birth is furnished neither with feet fit for walking, nor with hands able even to scratch; and unless their lips were actually applied to the breast by the mother, they would not know where to find it; and even when close to the nipple, they would, notwithstanding their desire for food, be more able to cry than to suck. This utter helplessness of body thus fits in with their infirmity of mind; nor would Christ's flesh have been \"in the likeness of sinful flesh,\" unless that sinful flesh had been such that the rational soul is oppressed by it in the way we have described,-whether this too has been derived from parents, or created in each case for the individual separately, or inspired from above,-concerning which I forbear from inquiring now.","index":"210","references":[]}]},{"name":"Chapter 70 [XXXIX.]-How Far Sin is Done Away in Infants by Baptism, Also Inadults, and What Advantage Results Therefrom.","index":72,"paragraphs":[{"text":"In infants it is certain that, by the grace of God, through His baptism who came in the likeness of sinful flesh, it is brought to pass that the sinful flesh is done away.

For should an infant live after baptism, and arrive at an age capable of obedience to a law, he finds there somewhat to fight against, and, by God's help, to overcome, if he has not received His grace in vain, and if he is not willing to be a reprobate. For not even to those who are of riper years is it given in baptism (except, perhaps, by an unspeakable miracle of the almighty Creator), that the law of sin which is in their members, warring against the law of their mind, should be entirely extinguished, and cease to exist; but that whatever of evil has been done, said, or thought by a man whilst he was servant to a mind subject to its concupiscence, should be abolished, and regarded as if it had never occurred. The concupiscence itself, however, (notwithstanding the loosening of the bond of guilt in which the devil, by it, used to keep the soul, and the destruction of the barrier which separated man from his Maker,) remains in the contest in which we chastenour body and bring it into subjection, whether to be relaxed for lawful and necessary uses, or to be restrained by continence.[fn-7-P718_462560:234-nf] But inasmuch as the Spirit of God, who knows so much better than we do all the past, and present, and future of the human race, foresaw and foretold that the life of man would be such that \"no man living should be justified in God's sight,\"[fn-7-P719_462822:235-nf] it happens that through ignorance or infirmity we do not exert all the powers of our will against it, and so yield to it in the commission of sundry unlawful things,-becoming worse in proportion to the greatness and frequency of our surrender; and better, in proportion to its un-importance and infrequency.
