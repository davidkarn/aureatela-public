Augustin takes the opportunity of discussing, in opposition to the pelagians, the subject of the aid of god's grace; and he shows that the divine help to the working of righteousness by us does not lie in the fact of God's having given us a law which is full of good and holy precepts; but in the fact that our will itself, without which we can do nothing good, is assisted and elevated by the spirit of grace being imparted to us, without the aid of which the teaching of the law is \"the letter that killeth,\" because instead of justifying the ungodly, it rather holds them guilty of transgression. He begins to treat of the question proposed to him at the commencement of this work, and returns to it towards its conclusion; he shows that, as all allow, many things are possible with God's help, of which there occurs indeed no example; and then concludes that, although a perfect righteousness is unexampled among men, it is for all that not impossible.","index":"71","references":[]}]},{"name":"Chapter 1 [I.] - the Occasion of Writing This Work; A Thing May Be Capable of Being Done, and Yet May Never Be Done.","index":3,"paragraphs":[{"text":"After reading the short treatises which I lately drew up for you, my beloved son Marcellinus, about the baptism of infants, and the perfection of man's righteousness, - how that no one in this life seems either to have attained or to be likely to attain to it, except only the Mediator, who bore humanity in the likeness of sinful flesh, without any sin whatever, - you wrote me in answer that you were embarrassed by the point which I advanced in the second book,[fn-12-P1263_645351:1-nf] that it was possible for a man to be without sin, if he wanted not the will, and was assisted by the aid of God; and yet that except One in whom \"all shall be made alive,\"[fn-12-P1264_645569:2-nf] no one has ever lived or will live by whom this perfection has been attained whilst living here.

But they allege that such attainments are not made without God's help on this account, namely, because God both created man with the free choice of his will, and, by giving him commandments, teaches him, Himself, how man ought to live; and indeed assists him, in that He takes away his ignorance by instructing him in the knowledge of what he ought to avoid and to desire in his actions: and thus, by means of the free-will naturally implanted within him, he enters on the way which is pointed out to him, and by persevering in a just and pious course of life, deserves to attain to the blessedness of eternal life.","index":"79","references":[]}]},{"name":"Chapter 5 [III.] - True Grace is the Gift of the Holy Ghost, Which Kindles in the Soul the Joy and Love of Goodness.","index":7,"paragraphs":[{"text":"We, however, on our side affirm that the human will is so divinely aided in the pursuit of righteousness, that (in addition to man's being created with a free-will, and in addition to the teaching by which he is instructed how he ought to live) he receives the Holy Ghost, by whom there is formed in his mind a delight in, and a love of, that supreme and unchangeable good which is God, even now while he is still \"walking by faith\" and not yet \"by sight;\"[fn-12-P1283_651066:9-nf] in order that by this gift to him of the earnest, as it were, of the free gift, he may conceive an ardent desire to cleave to his Maker, and may burn to enter upon the participation in that true light, that it may go well with him from Him to whom he owes his existence.

Therefore, the apostle is not to be confined to the limited application just mentioned, when he says, \"The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life;\"[fn-12-P1290_652997:13-nf] but this is also (and indeed especially) equivalent to what he says elsewhere in the plainest words: \"I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet;\"[fn-12-P1291_653189:14-nf] and again, immediately after: \"Sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.\"[fn-12-P1292_653312:15-nf] Now from this you may see what is meant by \"the letter that killeth.\" There is, of course, nothing, said figuratively which is not to be accepted in its plain sense, when it is said, \"Thou shall not covet;\" but this is a very plain and salutaryprecept, and any man who shall fulfil it will have I no sin at all. The apostle, indeed, purposely selected this general precept, in which he embraced everything, as if this were the voice of the law, prohibiting us from all sin, when he says, \"Thou shalt not covet;\" for there is no sin committed except by evil concupiscence; so that the law which prohibits this is a good and praiseworthy law. But, when the Holy Ghost withholds His help, which inspires us with a good desire instead of this evil desire (in other words, diffuses love in our hearts), that law, however good in itself, only augments the evil desire by forbidding it. Just as the rush of water which flows incessantly in a particular direction, becomes more violent when it meets with any impediment, and when it has overcome the stoppage, falls in a greater bulk, and with increased impetuosity hurries forward in its downward course. In some strange way the very object which we covet becomes all the more pleasant when it is forbidden.

When I shall have proved this, it will more manifestly appear that to lead a holy life is the gift of God,- not only because God has given a free-will to man, without which there is no living ill or well; nor only because He has given him a commandment to teach him how he ought to live; but because through the Holy Ghost He sheds love abroad in the hearts[fn-12-P1297_655594:17-nf] of those whom he foreknew, in order to predestinate them; whom He predestinated, that He might call them; whom He called, that he might justify them; and whom he justified, that He might glorify them.[fn-12-P1298_655813:18-nf] When this point also shall be cleared, you will, I think, see how vain it is to say that those things only are unexampled possibilities, which are the works of God,- such as the passage of the camel through the needle's eye, which we have already referred to, and other similar cases, which to us no doubt are impossible, but easy enough to God; and that man's righteousness is not to be counted in this class of things, on the ground Of its being properly man's work, not God's; although there is no reason for supposing, without an example, that his perfection exists, even if it is possible. That these assertions are vain will be clear enough, after it has been also plainly shown that even man's righteousness must be attributed to the operation of God, although not taking place without man's will; and we therefore cannot deny that his perfection is possible even in this life, because all things are possible with God,[fn-12-P1299_656765:19-nf] -both those which He accomplishes of His own sole will, and those which He appoints to be done with the cooperation with Himself of His creature's will.

For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written. Circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law; but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision. Therefore, if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law? For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh: but he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.\"[fn-13-P1336_668123:38-nf] Here he plainly showed in what sense he said, \"Thou makest thy boast of God.\" For undoubtedly if one who was truly a Jew made his boast of God in the way which grace demands (which is bestowed not for merit of works, but gratuitously), then his praise would be of God, and not of men. But they, in fact, were making their boast of God, as if they alone had deserved to receive His law, as the Psalmist said: \"He did not the like to any nation, nor His judgments has He displayed to them.\"[fn-13-P1337_668633:39-nf] And yet, they thought they were fulfilling the law of God by their righteousness, when they were rather breakers of it all the while!

He calls, however, \"the circumcision of the heart\" the will that is pure from all unlawful desire; which comes not from the letter, inculcating and threatening, but from the Spirit, assisting and healing.

But I ask your attention, O man, to what follows. \"But now the righteousness of God,\" says he, \"without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets.\"[fn-13-P1351_672050:47-nf] Does this then sound a light thing in deaf ears? He says, \"The righteousness of God is manifested.\" Now this righteousness they are ignorant of, who wish to establish one of their own; they will not submit themselves to it.[fn-13-P1352_672293:48-nf] His words are, \"The righteousness of God is manifested:\" he does not say, the righteousness of man, or the righteousness of his own will, but the \"righteousness of God,\"-not that whereby He is Himself righteous, but that with which He endows man when He justifies the ungodly. This is witnessed by the law and the prophets; in other words, the law and the prophets each afford it testimony. The law, indeed, by issuing its commands and threats, and by justifying no man, sufficiently shows that it is by God's gift, through the help of the Spirit, that a man is justified; and the prophets, because it was what they predicted that Christ at His coming accomplished. Accordingly he advances a step further, and adds, \"But righteousness of God by faith of Jesus Christ,\"[fn-13-P1353_673079:49-nf] that is by the faith wherewith one believes in Christ for just as there is not meant the faith with which Christ Himself believes, so also there is not meant the righteousness whereby God is Himself righteous. Both no doubt are ours, but yet they are called God's, and Christ's, because it is by their bounty that these gifts are bestowed upon us. The righteousness of God then is without the law, but not manifested without the law; for if it were manifested without the law, how could it be witnessed by the law? That righteousness of God, however, is without the law, which God by the Spirit of grace bestows on the believer without the help of the law,-that is, when not helped by the law. When, indeed, He by the law discovers to a man his weakness, it is in order that by faith he may flee for refuge to His mercy, and be healed. And thus concerning His wisdom we are told, that \"she carries law and mercy uponher tongue,\"[fn-13-P1354_674027:50-nf] - the \"law,\" whereby she may convict the proud, the \"mercy,\" wherewith she may justify the humbled. \"The righteousness of God,\" then, \"by faith of Jesus Christ, is unto all that believe; for there is no difference, for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God\"[fn-13-P1355_674319:51-nf] -not of their own glory.

For how can it be that \"the law is good, if a man use it lawfully,\" if what follows is also true: \"Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man?\"[fn-13-P1363_675512:56-nf] For who but a righteous man lawfully uses the law? Yet it is not for him that it is made, but for the unrighteous. Must then the unrighteous man, in order that he may be justified,- that is, become a righteous man,- lawfully use the law, to lead him, as by the schoolmaster's hand,[fn-13-P1364_675812:57-nf] to that grace by which alone he can fulfil what the law commands? Now it is freely that he is justified thereby,-that is, on account of no antecedent merits of his own works; \"otherwise grace is no more grace,\"[fn-13-P1365_676042:58-nf] since it is bestowed on us, not because we have done good works, but that we may be able to do them,- in other words, not because we have fulfilled the law, but in order that we may be able to fulfil the law. Now He said, \"I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil it,\"[fn-13-P1366_676335:59-nf] of whom it was said, \"We have seen His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.\"[fn-13-P1367_676474:60-nf] This is the glory which is meant in the words, \"All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;\"[fn-13-P1368_676593:61-nf] and this the grace of which he speaks in the next verse, \"Being justified freely by His grace.\"[fn-13-P1369_676709:62-nf] The unrighteous man therefore lawfully uses the law, that he may become righteous; but when he has become so, he must no longer use it as a chariot, for he has arrived at his journey's end,- or rather (that I may employ the apostle's own simile, which has been already mentioned) as a schoolmaster, seeing that he is now fully learned. How then is the law not made for a righteous man, if it is necessary for the righteous man too, not that hemay be brought as an unrighteous man to the grace that justifies, but that he may use it lawfully, now that he is righteous? Does not the case perhaps stand thus, -nay, not perhaps, but rather certainly,- that the man who is become righteous thus lawfully uses the law, when he applies it to alarm the unrighteous, so that whenever the disease of some unusual desire begins in them, too, to be augmented by the incentive of the law's prohibition and an increased amount of transgression, they may in faith flee for refuge to the grace that justifies, and becoming delighted with the sweet pleasures of holiness, may escape the penalty of the law's menacing letter through the spirit's soothing gift? In this way the two statements will not be contrary, nor will they be repugnant to each other: even the righteous man may lawfully use a good law, and yet the law be not made for the righteous man; for it is not by the law that he becomes righteous, but by the law of faith, which led him to believe that no other resource was possible to his weakness for fulfilling the precepts which \"the law of works\"[fn-13-P1370_678276:63-nf] commanded, except to be assisted by the grace of God.","index":"103","references":[{"fn":"13","code":"P1361_675117","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 Tim. i. 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 timothy","chapter":1,"verses":[8]}]},{"fn":"13","code":"P1362_675188","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 Tim. i. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 timothy","chapter":1,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"13","code":"P1363_675512","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 Tim. i. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 timothy","chapter":1,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"13","code":"P1364_675812","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Gal. iii. 24.","bible_refs":[{"book":"galatians","chapter":3,"verses":[24]}]},{"fn":"13","code":"P1365_676042","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. xi. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":11,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"13","code":"P1366_676335","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Matt. v. 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":5,"verses":[17]}]},{"fn":"13","code":"P1367_676474","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"John i. 14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":1,"verses":[14]}]},{"fn":"13","code":"P1368_676593","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. iii. 23.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":3,"verses":[23]}]},{"fn":"13","code":"P1369_676709","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. iii. 24.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":3,"verses":[24]}]},{"fn":"13","code":"P1370_678276","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. iii. 27.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":3,"verses":[27]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 17.- the Exclusion of Boasting.","index":19,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Accordingly he says, \"Where is boasting then?

Hastily, indeed, one might say that the law of works lay in Judaism, and the law of faith in Christianity; forasmuch as circumcision and the other works prescribed by the law are just those which the Christian system no longer retains. But there is a fallacy in this distinction, the greatness of which I have for some time been endeavoring to expose; and to such as are acute in appreciating distinctions, especially to yourself and those like you, I have possibly succeeded in my effort. Since, however, the subject is an important one, it will not be unsuitable, if with a view to its illustration, we linger over the many testimonies which again and again meet our view. Now, the apostle says that that law by which no man is justified,[fn-14-P1406_688816:84-nf] entered in that the offence might abound,[fn-14-P1407_688877:85-nf] and yet in order to save it from the aspersions of the ignorant and the accusations of the impious, he defends this very law in such words as these: \"What shall we say then? Is, the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin but by the law: for I had not known concupiscence, except the law had said, Thou shall not covet. But sin, taking occasion, wrought, by the commandment, in me all manner of concupiscence,\"[fn-14-P1408_689311:86-nf] He says also: \"The law indeed is holy, and the commandment is holy, and just, and good; but sin, that it might appear sin, worked death in me by that which is good.\"[fn-14-P1409_689498:87-nf] It is therefore the very letter that kills which says, \"Thou shalt not covet,\" and it is of this that he speaks in a passage which I have before referred to: \"By the law is the knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; even the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ upon all them that believe; for there is no difference: seeing that all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God: being justified freely by His grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus; whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare His righteousness at this time; that He might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.\"[fn-14-P1410_690389:88-nf] And then he adds the passage which is now under consideration: \"Where, then, is your boasting? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay; but by the law of faith.\"[fn-14-P1411_690576:89-nf] And so it is the very law of works itself which says, \"Thou shalt not covet;\" because thereby comes the knowledge of sin. Now I wish to know, if anybody will dare to tell me, whether the law of faith does not say to us, \"Thou shalt not covet\"? For if it does not say so to us, what reason is there why we, who are placed under it, should not sin in safety and with impunity? Indeed, this is just what those people thought the apostle meant, of whom he writes: \"Even as some affirm that we say, Let us do evil, that good may come; whose damnation is just.\"[fn-14-P1412_691151:90-nf] If, on the contrary, it too says to us, \"Thou shall not covet\" (even as numerous passages in the gospels and epistles so often testify and urge), then why is not this law also called the law of works? For it by no means follows that, because it retains not the \"works\"of the ancient sacraments, - even circumcision and the other ceremonies, - it therefore has no \"works\" in its own sacraments, which are adapted to the present age; unless, indeed, the question was about sacramental works, when mention was made of the law, just because by it is the knowledge of sin, and therefore nobody is justified by it, so that it is not by it that boasting is excluded, but by the law of faith, whereby the just man lives.

Now this is the reason why the law gives its command, - to admonish us what faith ought to do, that is, that he to whom the command is given, if he is as yet unable to perform it, may know what to ask for; but if he has at once the ability, and complies with the command, he ought also to be aware from whose gift the ability comes. \"For we have received not the spirit of this world,\" says again that most constant preacher of grace, \"but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.\"[fn-14-P1420_693454:95-nf] What, however, \"is the spirit of this world,\" but the spirit of pride?

Let him not fall into the mistake of the Pharisee, who, while thanking God for what he possessed, yet failed to ask for any further gift, just as if he stood in, want of nothing for the increase or perfection of his righteousness.[fn-14-P1423_694531:98-nf] Now, having duly considered and weighed all these circumstances and testimonies, we conclude that a man is not justified by the precepts of a holy life, but by faith in Jesus Christ,-in a word, not by the law of works, but by the law of faith; not by the letter,but by the spirit; not by the merits of deeds, but by free grace.","index":"115","references":[{"fn":"14","code":"P1416_692191","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Ex. xx. 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"exodus","chapter":20,"verses":[17]}]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1417_692422","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Wisdom viii. 21.","bible_refs":[{"book":"wisdom","chapter":8,"verses":[21]}]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1418_692594","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Jas. i. 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"james","chapter":1,"verses":[17]}]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1419_692757","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"2 Cor. x. 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":10,"verses":[17]}]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1420_693454","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 Cor. ii. 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":2,"verses":[12]}]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1421_693660","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. i. 21.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":1,"verses":[21]}]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1422_693890","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. x. 3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":10,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1423_694531","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Luke xviii. 11, 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":18,"verses":[11]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 23 [XIV.] -How the Decalogue Kills, If Grace Be Not Present.","index":25,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Although, therefore, the apostle seems to reprove and correct those who were being persuaded to be circumcised, in such terms as to designate by the word \"law\" circumcision itself and other similar legal observances, which are now rejected as shadows of a future substance by Christians who yet hold what those shadows figuratively promised; he at the same time nevertheless would have it to be clearly understood that the law, by which he says no man is justified, lies not merely in those sacramental institutions which contained promissory figures, but also in those works by which whosoever has done them lives holily, and amongst which occurs this prohibition: \"Thou shalt not covet.\" Now, to make our statement all the clearer, let us look at the Decalogue itself. It is certain, then, that Moses on the mount received the law, that he might deliver it to the people, written on tables of stone by the finger of God. It is summed up in these ten commandments, in which there is no precept about circumcision, nor anything concerning those animal sacrifices which have ceased to be offered by Christians. Well, now, I should like to be told what there is in these ten commandments, except the observance of the Sabbath, which ought not to be kept by a Christian,-whether it prohibit the making and worshipping of idols and of any other gods than the one true God, or the taking of God's name in vain; or prescribe honour to parents; or give warning against fornication, murder, theft, false witness, adultery, or coveting other men's property? Which of these commandments would any one say that the Christian ought not to keep? Is it possible to contend that it is not the law which was written on those two tables that the apostle describes as \"the letter that killeth,\" but the law of circumcision and the other sacred rites which are now abolished?

And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward: not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God; who hath made us fit, as ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance, which was to be done away; how shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious? For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more shall the ministration of righteousness abound in glory.[fn-14-P1431_698367:100-nf] A good deal might be said about these words; but perhaps we shall have a more fitting opportunity at some future time. At present, however, I beg you to observe how he speaks of the letter that killeth, and contrasts therewith the spirit that giveth life. Now this must certainly be \"the ministration of death written and engraven in stones,\" and \"the ministration of condemnation,\" since the law entered that sin might abound.[fn-14-P1432_698819:101-nf] But the commandments themselves are so useful and salutary to the doer of them, that no one could have life unless he kept them. Well, then, is it owing to the one precept about the Sabbath-day, which is included in it, that the Decalogue is called \"the letter that killeth?\" Because, forsooth, every man that still observes that day in its literal appointment is carnally wise, but to be carnally wise is nothing else than death? And must the other nine commandments, which are rightly observed in their literal form, not be regarded as belonging to the law of works by which none is justified, but to the law of faith whereby the just man lives?

For what else does the phrase \"being justified\" signify than being made righteous, - by Him, of course, who justifies the ungodly man, that he may become a godly one instead? For if we were to express a certain fact by saying, \"The men will be liberated,\" the phrase would of course be understood as asserting that the liberation would accrue to those who were men already; but if we were to say, The men will be created, we should certainly not be understood as asserting that the creation would happen to those who were already in existence, but that they became men by the creation itself. If in like manner it were said, The doers of the law shall be honoured, we should only interpret the statement correctly if we supposed that the honour was to accrue to those who were already doers of the law: but when the allegation is, \"The doers of the law shall be justified,\" what else does it mean than that the just shall be justified? for of course the doers of the law are just persons. And thus it amounts to the same thing as if it were said, The doers of the law shall be created,- not those who were so already, but that they may become such; in order that the Jews who were hearers of the law might hereby understand that they wanted the grace of the Justifier, in order to be able to become its doers also. Or else the term \"They shall be justified\" is used in the sense of, They shall be deemed, or reckoned as just, as it is predicated of a certain man in the Gospel, \"But he, willing to justify himself,\"[fn-16-P1616_744310:222-nf] - meaning that he wished to be thought and accounted just.

We shall see more easily, if we first examine with some care what \"our power\" means. Since, then, there are two things,-will and ability; it follows that not every one that has the will has therefore the ability also, nor has every one that possesses the ability the will also; for as we sometimes will what we cannot do, so also we sometimes can do what we do not will. From the words themselves when sufficiently considered, we shall detect, in the very ring of the terms, the derivation of volition from willingness, and of ability from ableness.[fn-17-P1712_766943:294-nf] Therefore, even as the man who wishes has volition, so also the man who can has ability. But in order that a thing may be done by ability, the volition must be present. For no man is usually said to do a thing with ability if he did it unwillingly. Although, at the same time, if we observe more precisely, even what a man is compelled to do unwillingly, he does, if he does it, by his volition; only he is said to be an unwilling agent, or to act against his will, because he would prefer some other thing. He is compelled, indeed, by some unfortunate influence, to do what he does under compulsion, wishing to escape it or to remove it out of his way. For if his volition be so strong that he prefers not doing this to not suffering that, then beyond doubt he resists the compelling influence, and does it not. And accordingly, if he does it, it is not with a full and free will, but yet it is not without will that he does it; and inasmuch as the volition is followed by its effect, we cannot say that he lacked the ability to do it. If, indeed, he willed to do it, yielding to compulsion, but could not, although we should allow that a coerced will was present, we should yet say that ability was absent. But when he did not do the thing because he was unwilling, then of course the ability was present, but the volition was absent, since he did it not, by his resistance to the compelling influence. Hence it is that even they who compel, or who persuade, are accustomed to say, Why don't you do what you have in your ability, in order to avoid this evil? While they who are utterly unable to do what they are compelled to do, because they are supposed to be able usually answer by excusing themselves, and say, I would do it if it were in my ability. What then do we ask more, since we call that ability when to the volition is added the faculty of doing? Accordingly, every one is said to have that in his ability which he does if he likes, and does not if he dislikes.

But, as the apostle says: \"There is no power but comes from God,\"[fn-17-P1720_770926:299-nf] what reason then is there why it may not be said to us even of this: \"What hast thou which thou hast not received?\"[fn-17-P1721_771063:300-nf] -for it is God who gave us even to believe. Nowhere, however, in Holy Scripture do we find such an assertion as, There is no volition but comes from God. And rightly is it not so written, because it is not true: otherwise God would be the author even of sins (which Heaven forbid!), if there were no volition except what comes from Him; inasmuch as an evil volition alone is already a sin, even if the effect be wanting,-in other words, if it has not ability. But when the evil volition receives ability to accomplish its intention, this proceeds from the judgment of God, with whom there is no unrighteousness.[fn-17-P1722_771696:301-nf] He indeed punishes after this manner; nor is His chastisement unjust because it is secret. The ungodly man, however, is not aware that he is being punished, except when he unwillingly discovers by an open penalty how much evil he has willingly committed. This is just what the apostle says of certain men: \"God hath given them up to the evil desires of their own hearts, . . . to do those things that are not convenient.\"[fn-17-P1723_772138:302-nf] Accordingly, the Lord also said to Pilate: \"Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above.\"[fn-17-P1724_772291:303-nf] But still, when the ability is given, surely no necessity is imposed.

These persons also believe in God; for if they had no faith in Him at all, neither would they of course have any dread of the penalty of His law.

For even this have they received; for the Only-begotten \"gave them power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name;\"[fn-17-P1739_776017:312-nf] and He advised them to ask, to seek, and to knock, in order to receive, to find, and to have the gate opened to them,[fn-17-P1740_776154:313-nf] adding by way of rebuke, the words : \"If ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him?\"[fn-17-P1741_776373:314-nf] When, therefore, that strength of sin, the law,[fn-17-P1742_776443:315-nf] inflamed the sting of death, even sin, to take occasion and by the commandment work all manner of concupiscence in them,[fn-17-P1743_776586:316-nf] of whom were they to ask for the gift of continence but of Him who knows how to give good gifts to His children?

Let him, however, ask in faith, nothing wavering? \"[fn-17-P1746_777329:319-nf] This is the faith by which the just man lives;[fn-17-P1747_777397:320-nf] this is the faith whereby he believes on Him who justifies the ungodly;[fn-17-P1748_777488:321-nf] this is the faith through which boasting is excluded,[fn-17-P1749_777561:322-nf] either by the retreat of that with which we become self-inflated, or by the rising of that with which we glory in the Lord. This, again, is the faith by which we procure that largess of the Spirit, of which it is said: \"We indeed through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.\"[fn-17-P1750_777877:323-nf] But this admits of the further question, Whether he meant by \"the hope of righteousness\" that by which righteousness hopes, or that whereby righteousness is itself hoped for? For the just man, who lives by faith, hopes undoubtedly for eternal life; and the faith likewise, which hungers and thirsts for righteousness, makes progress therein by the renewal of the inward man day by day,[fn-17-P1751_778281:324-nf] and hopes to be satiated therewith in that eternal life, where shall be realized that which is said of God by the psalm: \"Who satisfieth thy desire with good things.\"[fn-17-P1752_778470:325-nf] This, moreover, is the faith whereby they are saved to whom it is said: \"By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.\"[fn-17-P1753_778822:326-nf] This, in short, is the faith which works not by fear, but by love;[fn-17-P1754_778910:327-nf] not by dreading punishment, but by loving righteousness. Whence, therefore, arises this love,-that is to say, this charity,-by which faith works, if not from the source whence faith itself obtained it? For it would not be within us, to what extent soever it is in us, if it were not diffused in our hearts by the Holy Ghost who is given to us.[fn-17-P1755_779272:328-nf] Now \"the love of God\" is said to be shed abroad in our hearts, not because He loves us, but because He makes us lovers of Himself; just as \"the righteousness of God\"[fn-17-P1756_779456:329-nf] is used in the sense of our being made righteous by His gift; and \"the salvation of the Lord,\"[fn-17-P1757_779572:330-nf] in that we are saved by Him; and \"the faith of Jesus Christ,\"[fn-17-P1758_779653:331-nf] because He makes us believers in Him.

It may be, however, objected in reply, that we must take heed lest some one should suppose that the sin would have to be imputed to God which is committed by free will, if in the passage where it is asked, \"What hast thou which thou didst not receive?\"[fn-17-P1797_789473:358-nf] the very will by which we believe is reckoned as a gift of God, because it arises out of the free will which we received at our creation. Let the objector, however, attentively observe that this will is to be ascribed to the divine gift, not merely because it arises from our free will, which was created naturally with us; but also because God acts upon us by the incentives of our perceptions, to will and to believe, either externally by evangelical exhortations, where even the commands of the law also do something, if they so far admonish a man of his infirmity that he betakes himself to the grace that justifies by believing; or internally, where no man has in his own control what shall enter into his thoughts, although it appertains to his own will to consent or to dissent. Since God, therefore, in such ways acts upon the reasonable soul in order that it may believe in Him (and certainly there is no ability whatever in free will to believe, unless there be persuasion or summons towards some one in whom to believe), it surely follows that it is God who both works in man the willing to believe, and in all things prevents us with His mercy. To yield our consent, indeed, to God's summons, or to withhold it, is (as I have said) the function of our own will. And this not only does not invalidate what is said, \"For what hast thou that thou didst not receive?\"[fn-17-P1798_790871:359-nf] but it really confirms it. For the soul cannot receive and possess these gifts, which are here referred to, except by yielding its consent. And thus whatever it possesses, and whatever it receives, is from God; and yet the act of receiving and having belongs, of course, to the receiver and possessor. Now, should any man be for constraining us to examine into this profound mystery, why this person is so persuaded as to yield, and that person is not, there are only two things occurring to me, which I should like to advance as my answer: \"O the depth of the riches!\"[fn-17-P1799_791463:360-nf] and \"Is there unrighteousness with God?\"[fn-18-P1800_791524:361-nf] If the man is displeased with such an answer, he must seek more learned disputants; but let him beware lest he find presumptuous ones.","index":"191","references":[{"fn":"17","code":"P1797_789473","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 Cor. iv. 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":4,"verses":[7]}]},{"fn":"17","code":"P1798_790871","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 Cor. iv. 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":4,"verses":[7]}]},{"fn":"17","code":"P1799_791463","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. xi. 33.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":11,"verses":[33]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1800_791524","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. ix. 14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":9,"verses":[14]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 61 [XXXV.]-Conclusion of the Work.","index":63,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Let us at last bring our book to an end.

You were perplexed how I could have said that it was possible for a man to be without sin, if his will were not wanting, by the help of God's aid, although no man in the present life had ever lived, was living, or would live, of such perfect righteousness. Now, in the books which I formerly addressed to you, I set forth this very question. I said: \"If I were asked whether it be possible for a man to be without sin in this life, I should allow the possibility, by the grace of God, and his own free will; for I should have no doubt that the free will itself is of God's grace,-that is, has its place among the gifts of God,-not only as to its existence, but also in respect of its goodness; that is, that it applies itself to doing the commandments of God. And so, God's grace not only shows what ought to be done, but also helps to the possibility of doing what it shows.\"[fn-18-P1808_793715:363-nf] You seemed to think it absurd, that a thing which was possible should be unexampled. Hence arose the subject treated of in this book; and thus did it devolve on me to show that a thing was possible although no example of it could be found. We accordingly adduced certain cases out of the gospel and of the law, at the beginning of this work,-such as the passing of a camel through the eye of a needle;[fn-18-P1809_794180:364-nf] and the twelve thousand legions of angels, who could fight for Christ, if He pleased;[fn-18-P1810_794288:365-nf] and those nations which God said He could have exterminated at once from the face of His people,[fn-18-P1811_794408:366-nf] -none of which possibilities were ever reduced to fact. To these instances may be added those which are referred to in the Book of Wisdom,[fn-18-P1812_794587:367-nf] suggesting how many are the strange torments and troubles which God was able to employ against ungodly men, by using the creature which was obedient to His beck, which, however, He did not employ. One might also allude to that mountain, which faith could remove into the sea,[fn-18-P1813_794882:368-nf] although, nevertheless, it was never done, so far as we have ever read[fn-18-P1814_794975:369-nf] or heard. Now you see how thoughtless and foolish would be the man who should say that any one of these things is impossible with God, and how opposed to the sense of Scripture would be his assertion.

And I am never so much delighted in my treatment of a subject as when Scripture comes most copiously to my aid; and when the question to be discussed requires that \"he that glorieth should glory in the Lord;\"[fn-18-P1818_796284:370-nf] and that we should in all things lift up our hearts and give thanks to the Lord our God, from whom, \"as the Father of lights, every good and every perfect gift cometh down.\"[fn-18-P1819_796479:371-nf] Now if a gift is not God's gift, because it is wrought by us, or because we act by His gift, then it is not a work of God that \"a mountain should be removed into the sea,\" inasmuch as, according to the Lord's statement, it is by the faith of men that this is possible.

There would, however, be so much will, if there were hidden from us none of those conditions which pertain to righteousness; and at the same time these so delighted our mind, that whatever hindrance of pleasure or pain might else occur, this delight in holiness would prevail over every rival affection. And that this is not realized, is not owing to any intrinsic impossibility, but to God's judicial act. For who can be ignorant, that what he should know is not in man's power; nor does it follow that what he has discovered to be a desirable object is actually desired, unless he also feel a delight in that object, commensurate with its claims on his affection?

A thing may indeed be known or believed, and yet not loved; but it is an impossibility that a thing can be loved which is neither known nor believed.

Therefore the first commandment about righteousness, which bids us love the Lord with all our heart, and soul, and mind[fn-18-P1833_801299:382-nf] (the next to which is, that we love our neighbour as ourselves), we shall completely fulfil in that life when we shall see face to face.[fn-18-P1834_801459:383-nf] But even now this commandment is enjoined upon us, that we may be reminded what we ought by faith to require, and what we should in our hope look forward to, and, \"forgetting the things which are behind, reach forth to the things which are before.\"[fn-18-P1835_801732:384-nf] And thus, as it appears to me, that man has made a far advance, even in the present life, in the righteousness which is to be perfected hereafter, who has discovered by this very advance how very far removed he is from the completion of righteousness.","index":"199","references":[{"fn":"18","code":"P1824_798441","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Matt. xxii. 40.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":22,"verses":[40]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1825_798708","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Matt. xxii. 37, 39.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":22,"verses":[37]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1826_798949","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Jas. iii. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"james","chapter":3,"verses":[2]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1827_799511","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 Cor. xiii. 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":13,"verses":[12]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1828_799644","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 Cor. xiii. 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":13,"verses":[12]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1829_800515","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"John xv. 13.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":15,"verses":[13]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1830_800670","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"2 Cor. v. 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":5,"verses":[7]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1831_800764","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. viii. 23.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":8,"verses":[23]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1832_800924","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Eph. iii. 20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"ephesians","chapter":3,"verses":[20]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1833_801299","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Matt. xxii. 37.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":22,"verses":[37]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1834_801459","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 Cor. xiii. 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":13,"verses":[12]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1835_801732","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Phil. iii. 13.","bible_refs":[{"book":"philippians","chapter":3,"verses":[13]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 65.-In What Sense a Sinless Righteousness in This Life Can Be Asserted.","index":67,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Forasmuch, however, as an inferior righteousness may be said to be competent to this life, whereby the just man lives by faith[fn-18-P1839_802211:385-nf] although absent from the Lord, and, therefore, walking by faith and not yet by sight,[fn-18-P1840_802317:386-nf] -it may be without absurdity said, no doubt, in respect of it, that it is free from sin; for it ought not to be attributed to it as a fault, that it is not as yet sufficient for so great a love to God as is due to the final, complete, and perfect condition thereof. It is one thing to fail at present in attaining to the fulness of love, and another thing to be swayed by no lust. A man ought therefore to abstain from every unlawful desire, although he loves God now far less than it is possible to love Him when He becomes an object of sight; just as in matters connected with the bodily senses, the eye can receive no pleasure from any kind of darkness, although it may be unable to look with a firm sight amidst refulgent light. Only let us see to it that we so constitute the soul of man in this corruptible body,that, although it has not yet swallowed up and consumed the motions of earthly lust in that super-eminent perfection of the love of God, it nevertheless, in that inferior righteousness to which we have referred, gives no consent to the aforesaid lust for the purpose of effecting any unlawful thing. In respect, therefore, of that immortal life, the commandment is even now applicable: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might;\"[fn-18-P1841_803645:387-nf] but in reference to the present life the following: \"Let not sin reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.\"[fn-18-P1842_803803:388-nf] To the one, again, belongs, \"Thou shalt not covet;\"[fn-18-P1843_803875:389-nf] to the other, \"Thou shalt not go after thy lusts.\"[fn-18-P1844_803945:390-nf] To the one it appertains to seek for nothing more than to continue in its perfect state; to the other it belongs actively to do the duty committed to it, and to hope as its reward for the perfection of the future life,-so that in the one the just man may live forevermore in the sight of that happiness which in this life was his object of desire; in the other, he may live by that faith whereon rests his desire for the ultimate blessedness as its certain end. (These things being so, it will be sin in the man who lives by faith ever to consent to an unlawful delight,-by committing not only frightful deeds and crimes, but even trifling faults; sinful, if he lend an ear to a word that ought not to be listened to, or a tongue to a phrase which shouldnot be uttered; sinful, if he entertains a thought in his heart in such a way as to wish that an evil pleasure were a lawful one, although known to be unlawful by the commandment,-for this amounts to a consent to sin, which would certainly be carried out in act, unless fear of punishment deterred.)[fn-18-P1845_805025:391-nf] Have such just men, while living by faith, no need to say: \"Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors?\"[fn-18-P1846_805344:392-nf] And do they prove this to be wrong which is written, \"In Thy sight shall no man living be justified?\"[fn-18-P1847_805466:393-nf] and this: \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us?\"[fn-18-P1848_805581:394-nf] and, \"There is no manthat sinneth not;\"[fn-18-P1849_805641:395-nf] and again, \"There is not on the earth a righteous man, who doeth good and sinneth not\"[fn-18-P1850_805753:396-nf] (for both these statements are expressed in a general future sense,-\"sinneth not,\" \"will not sin,\"-not in the past time, \"has not sinned\")?-and all other places of this purport contained in the Holy Scripture? Since, however, these passages cannot possibly be false, it plainly follows, to my mind, that whatever be the quality or extent of the righteousness which we may definitely ascribe to the present life, there is not a man living in it who is absolutely free from all sin; and that it is necessary for every one to give, that it may be given to him;[fn-18-P1851_806335:397-nf] and to forgive, that it may be forgiven him;[fn-18-P1852_806404:398-nf] and whatever righteousness he has, not to presume that he has it of himself, but from the grace of God, who justifies him, and still to go on hungering and thirsting for righteousness[fn-18-P1853_806607:399-nf] from Him who is the living bread,[fn-18-P1854_806660:400-nf] and with whom is the fountain of life;[fn-18-P1855_806719:401-nf] who works in His saints, whilst labouring amidst temptation in this life, their justification in such manner that He may still have somewhat to impart to them liberally when they ask, and something mercifully to forgive them when they confess.","index":"201","references":[{"fn":"18","code":"P1839_802211","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. i. 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":1,"verses":[17]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1840_802317","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"2 Cor. v. 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":5,"verses":[7]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1841_803645","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Deut. vi. 5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"deuteronomy","chapter":6,"verses":[5]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1842_803803","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. vi. 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":6,"verses":[12]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1843_803875","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Ex. xx. 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"exodus","chapter":20,"verses":[17]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1844_803945","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Ecclus. xviii. 30.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1845_805025","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"The Benedictine editor is not satisfied with the place of the lines in the parenthesis.

Of course they are not at all able to discover such a man, if they receive in a becoming manner the testimony of the divine writings. Still, for all that, it must not by any means be said that the possibility is lacking to God whereby the will of man can be so assisted, that there can be accomplished in every respect even now in a man, not that righteousness only which is of faith,[fn-18-P1859_807913:402-nf] but that also in accordance with which we shall by and by have to live for ever in the very vision of God.
