Afterwards, in opposition to the pelagians, he proves that grace is not bestowed according to our merits. He explains how eternal life, which is rendered to good works, is really of grace. He then goes on to show that the grace which is given to us through our Lord Jesus Christ is neither the knowledge of the law, nor nature, nor simply remission of sins; but that it is grace that makes us fulfil the law, and causes nature to be liberated from the dominion of sin. He demolishes that vain subterfuge of the Pelagians, to the effect that \"grace, although it is not bestowed according to the merits of good works, is yet given according to the merits of the antecedent good-will of the man who believes and prays.\" he incidentally touches the question, why God commands what he means Himself to give, and whether He imposes on us any commands which we are unable to perform. He clearly shows that the love which is indispensable for fulfilling the commandments is only within us from God Himself. He points out that God works in men's hearts to incline their wills whithersoever He willeth, either to good works according to His mercy, or to evil ones in return for their deserving; His judgment, indeed, being sometimes manifest, sometimes hidden, but always righteous. Lastly, he teaches us that a clear example of the gratuitousness of grace, not given in return for our deserts, is supplied to us in the case of those infants which are saved, while others perish though their case is identical with that of the rest.","index":"55","references":[]}]},{"name":"Chapter I [I.]-The Occasion and Argument of This Work.","index":3,"paragraphs":[{"text":"With reference to those persons who so preach and defend man's free will, as boldly to deny, and endeavour to do away with, the grace of God which Calls us to Him, and delivers us from our evil deserts, and by which we obtain the good deserts which lead to everlasting life: we have already said a good deal in discussion, and committed it to writing, so far as the Lord has vouchsafed to enable us. But since there are some persons who so defend God's grace as to deny man's free will, or who suppose that free will is denied when grace is defended, I have determined to write somewhat on this point to your Love,[fn-58-P5886_2309681:1-nf] my brother Valentinus, and the rest of you, who are serving God together under the impulse of a mutual love. For it has been told me concerning you, brethren, by some members of your brotherhood who have visited us, and are the bearers of this communication of ours to you, that there are dissensions among you on this subject. This, then, being the case, dearly beloved, that you be not disturbed by the obscurity of this question, I counsel you first to thank God for such things as you understand; but as for all which is beyond the reach of your mind, pray for understanding from the Lord, observing, at the same time peace and love among yourselves; and until He Himself lead you to perceive what at present is beyond your comprehension, walk firmly on the ground of which you are sure. This is the advice of the Apostle Paul, who, after saying that he was not yet perfect,[fn-58-P5887_2310602:2-nf] a little later adds, \"Let us, therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus minded,\"[fn-58-P5888_2310702:3-nf] -meaning perfect to a certain extent, but not having attained to a perfection sufficient for us; and then immediately adds, \"And if, in any thing, ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you. Nevertheless, whereunto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule.\"[fn-58-P5889_2311009:4-nf] For by walking in what we have attained, we shall be able to advance to what we have not yet attained,-God revealing it to us if in anything we are otherwise minded,-provided we do not give up what He has already revealed.","index":"57","references":[{"fn":"58","code":"P5886_2309681","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"A form of address, like \"your Honour.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"58","code":"P5887_2310602","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Phil. iii. 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"philippians","chapter":3,"verses":[12]}]},{"fn":"58","code":"P5888_2310702","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Phil. iii. 15.","bible_refs":[{"book":"philippians","chapter":3,"verses":[15]}]},{"fn":"58","code":"P5889_2311009","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Phil. iii. 16.","bible_refs":[{"book":"philippians","chapter":3,"verses":[16]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 2 [II]-Proves the Existence of Free Will in Man from the Precepts Addressed to Him by God.","index":4,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Now He has revealed to us, through His Holy Scriptures, that there is in a man a free choice of will. But how He has revealed this I do not recount in human language, but in divine. There is, to begin with, the fact that God's precepts themselves would be of no use to a man unless he had free choice of will, so that by performing them he might obtain the promised rewards. For they are given that no one might be able to plead the excuse of ignorance, as the Lord says concerning the Jews in the gospel: \"If I had not come and spoken unto them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.\"[fn-58-P5893_2311963:5-nf] Of what sin does He speak but of that great one which He foreknew, while speaking thus, that they would make their own-that is, the death they were going to inflict upon Him? For they did not have \"no sin\" before Christ came to them in the flesh. The apostle also says: \"The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold back the truth in unrighteousness; because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath showed it unto them. For the invisible things of Him are from the creation of the world clearly seen-being understood by the things that are made-even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are inexcusable.\"[fn-58-P5894_2312672:6-nf] In what sense does he pronounce them to be \"inexcusable,\" except with reference to such excuse as human pride is apt to allege in such words as, \"If I had only known, I would have done it; did I not fail to do it because I was ignorant of it?\" or,\" I would do it if I knew how; but I do not know, therefore I do not do it\"? All such excuse is removed from them when the precept is given them, or the knowledge is made manifest to them how to avoid sin.","index":"59","references":[{"fn":"58","code":"P5893_2311963","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"John xv. 22.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":15,"verses":[22]}]},{"fn":"58","code":"P5894_2312672","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. i. 18-20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":1,"verses":[18]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 3.-Sinners are Convicted When Attempting to Excuse Themselves by Blaming God, Because They Have Free Will.","index":5,"paragraphs":[{"text":"There are, however, persons who attempt to find excuse for themselves even from God.

Then, when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.\"[fn-58-P5898_2313680:7-nf] Solomon, too, in his book of Proverbs, has this answer for such as wish to find an excuse for themselves from God Himself: \"The folly of a man spoils his ways;but he blames God in his heart.\"[fn-58-P5899_2313890:8-nf] And in the book of Ecclesiasticus we read: \"Say not thou, It is through the Lord that I fell away; for thou oughtest not to do the things that He hateth: nor do thou say, He hath caused me to err; for He hath no need of the sinful man.

Then again, there are so many commandments which in some way are expressly adapted to the human will; for instance, there is, \"Be not overcome of evil,\"[fn-59-P5905_2315286:11-nf] and others of similar import, such as, \"Be not like a horse or a mule, which have no understanding;\"[fn-59-P5906_2315405:12-nf] and, \"Reject not the counsels of thy mother;\"[fn-59-P5907_2315470:13-nf] and, \"Be not wise in thine own conceit;\"[fn-59-P5908_2315528:14-nf] and, \"Despise not the chastening of the Lord;\"[fn-59-P5909_2315594:15-nf] and, \"Forget not my law;\"[fn-59-P5910_2315640:16-nf] and, \"Forbear not to do good to the poor;\"[fn-59-P5911_2315702:17-nf] and, \"Devise not evil against thy friend;\"[fn-59-P5912_2315765:18-nf] and, \"Give no heed to a worthless woman;[fn-59-P5913_2315826:19-nf] and, \"He is not inclined to understand how to do good;\"[fn-59-P5914_2315899:20-nf] and, \"They refused to attend to my counsel;\"[fn-59-P5915_2315963:21-nf] with numberless other passages of the inspired Scriptures of the Old Testament. And what do they all show us but the free choice of the human will? So, again, in the evangelical and apostolic books of the New Testament what other lesson is taught us? As when it is said, \"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth; \"[fn-59-P5916_2316303:22-nf] and, \"Fear not them which kill the body;\"[fn-59-P5917_2316364:23-nf] and, \"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself;\"[fn-59-P5918_2316441:24-nf] and again, \"Peace on earth to men of good will.\"[fn-59-P5919_2316510:25-nf] So also that the Apostle Paul says: \"Let him do what he willeth; he sinneth not if he marry. Nevertheless, he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.\"[fn-59-P5920_2316806:26-nf] And so again,\" If I do this willingly, I have a reward;\"[fn-59-P5921_2316888:27-nf] while in another passage he says, \"Be ye sober and righteous, and sin not;\"[fn-59-P5922_2316984:28-nf] and again, \"As ye have a readiness to will, so also let there be a prompt performance;\"[fn-59-P5923_2317092:29-nf] then he remarks to Timothy about the younger widows, \"When they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they choose to marry.\" So in another passage, \"All that will to live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution;\"[fn-59-P5924_2317337:30-nf] while to Timothy himself he says, \"Neglect not the gift that is in thee.\"[fn-59-P5925_2317432:31-nf] Then to Philemon he addresses this explanation: \"That thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but of thine own will.\"[fn-59-P5926_2317581:32-nf] Servants also he advises to obey their masters \"with a good will.\"[fn-59-P5927_2317666:33-nf] In strict accordance with this, James says: \"Do not err, my beloved brethren . . . and have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ with respect to persons;\"[fn-59-P5928_2317840:34-nf] and,\" Do not speak evil one of another.\"[fn-59-P5929_2317908:35-nf] So also John in his Epistle writes,\" Do not love the world,\"[fn-59-P5930_2317987:36-nf] and other things of the same import. Now wherever it is said, \"Do not do this,\" and \"Do not do that,\" and wherever there is any requirement in the divine admonitions for the work of the will to do anything, or to refrain from doing anything, there is at once a sufficient proof of free will. No man, therefore, when he sins, can in his heart blame God for it, but every man must impute the fault to himself. Nor does it detract at all from a man's own will when he performs any act in accordance with God. Indeed, a work is then to be pronounced a good one when a person does it willingly; then, too, may the reward of a good work be hoped for from Him concerning whom it is written, \"He shall reward every man according to his works.\"[fn-59-P5931_2318743:37-nf] ","index":"63","references":[{"fn":"59","code":"P5904_2315024","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Ps. i. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":1,"verses":[2]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5905_2315286","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. xii. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":12,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5906_2315405","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Ps. xxxii. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":32,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5907_2315470","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Prov. i. 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","chapter":1,"verses":[8]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5908_2315528","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Prov. iii. 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","chapter":3,"verses":[7]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5909_2315594","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Prov. iii. 11.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","chapter":3,"verses":[11]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5910_2315640","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Prov. iii. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","chapter":3,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5911_2315702","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Prov. iii. 27.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","chapter":3,"verses":[27]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5912_2315765","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Prov. iii. 29.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","chapter":3,"verses":[29]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5913_2315826","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Prov. v. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","chapter":5,"verses":[2]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5914_2315899","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Ps. xxxvi. 3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":36,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5915_2315963","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Prov. i. 30.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","chapter":1,"verses":[30]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5916_2316303","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Matt. vi. 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":6,"verses":[19]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5917_2316364","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Matt. x. 28","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":10,"verses":[28]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5918_2316441","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Matt. xvi. 24.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[24]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5919_2316510","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Luke ii. 14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":2,"verses":[14]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5920_2316806","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 Cor. vii. 36, 37.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":7,"verses":[36]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5921_2316888","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 Cor. ix. 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":9,"verses":[17]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5922_2316984","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 Cor. xv. 34.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":15,"verses":[34]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5923_2317092","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"2 Cor. viii. 11.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":8,"verses":[11]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5924_2317337","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"2 Tim. iii. 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 timothy","chapter":3,"verses":[12]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5925_2317432","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 Tim. iv. 14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 timothy","chapter":4,"verses":[14]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5926_2317581","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Philemon 14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"philemon","chapter":1,"verses":[14]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5927_2317666","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Eph. vi. 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"ephesians","chapter":6,"verses":[7]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5928_2317840","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Jas. i. 16, and ii. 1","bible_refs":[{"book":"james","chapter":1,"verses":[16]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5929_2317908","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Jas. iv. 11.","bible_refs":[{"book":"james","chapter":4,"verses":[11]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5930_2317987","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 John ii. 15.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 john","chapter":2,"verses":[15]}]},{"fn":"59","code":"P5931_2318743","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Matt. xvi. 27.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[27]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 5.-He Shows that Ignorance Affords No Such Excuse as Shall Free the Offender from Punishment; But that to Sin with Knowledge is a Graver Thing Than to Sin in Ignorance.","index":7,"paragraphs":[{"text":"The excuse such as men are in the habit of alleging from ignorance is taken away from those persons who know God's commandments. But neither will those be without punishment who know not the law of God. \"For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law; and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law.\"[fn-59-P5935_2319280:38-nf] Now the apostle does not appear to me to have said this as if he meant that they would have to suffer something worse who in their sins are ignorant of the law than they who know it. [III.] It is seemingly worse, no doubt, \"to perish\" than \"to be judged;\" but inasmuch as he was speaking of the Gentiles and of the Jews when he used these words, because the former were without the law, but the latter had received the law, who can venture to say that the Jews who sin in the law will not perish, since they refused to believe in Christ, when it was of them that the apostle said, \"They shall be judged by the law\"? For without faith in Christ no man can be delivered; and therefore they will be so judged that they perish. If, indeed, the condition of those who are ignorant of the law of God is worse than the condition of those who know it, how can that be true which the Lord says in the gospel: \"The servant who knows not his lord's will, and commits things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes; whereas the servant who knows his lord's will, and commits things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with many stripes \"?[fn-59-P5936_2320437:39-nf] Observe how clearly He here shows that it is a graver matter for a man to sin with knowledge than in ignorance. And yet we must not on this account betake ourselves for refuge to the shades of ignorance, with the view of finding our excuse therein. It is one thing to be ignorant, and another thing to be unwilling to know. For the will is at fault in the case of the man of whom it is said, \"He is not inclined to understand, so as to do good.\"[fn-59-P5937_2320906:40-nf] But even the ignorance, which is not theirs who refuse to know, but theirs who are, as it were, simply ignorant, does not so far excuse any one as to exempt him from the punishment of eternal fire, though his failure to believe has been the result of his not having at all heard what he should believe; but probably only so far as to mitigate his punishment. For it was not said without reason: \"Pour out Thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known Thee;\"[fn-59-P5938_2321384:41-nf] nor again according to what the apostle says: \"When He shall come from heaven in a flame of fire to take vengeance on them that know not God.\"[fn-59-P5939_2321545:42-nf] But yet in order that we may have that knowledge that will prevent our saying, each one of us, \"I did not know,\" \"I did not hear,\" \"I did not understand;\" the human will is summoned, in such words as these: \"Wish not to be as the horse or as the mule, which have no understanding;\"[fn-59-P5940_2321850:43-nf] although it may show itself even worse, of which it is written, \"A stubborn servant will not be reproved by words; for even if he understand, yet he will not obey.\"[fn-59-P5941_2322034:44-nf] But when a man says, \"I cannot do what I am commanded, because I am mastered by my concupiscence,\" he has no longer any excuse to plead from ignorance, nor reason to blame God in his heart, but he recognises and laments his own evil in himself; and still to such an one the apostle says: \"Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good;\"[fn-59-P5942_2322399:45-nf] and of course the very fact that the injunction, \"Consent not to be overcome,\" is addressed to him, undoubtedly summons the determination of his will.

In order, therefore, to show that his admonition to man was not to have hope in himself, after saying, \"Cursed is the man who has hope in man,\" he immediately added, \"And maketh strong the flesh of his arm.\" He used the word \"arm\" to designate power in operation. By the term \"flesh,\" however, must be understood human frailty. And therefore he makes strong the flesh of his arm who supposes that a power which is frail and weak (that is, human) is sufficient for him to perform good works, and therefore puts not his hope in God for help. This is the reason why he subjoined the further clause, \"And whose heart departeth from the Lord.\" Of this character is the Pelagian heresy, which is not an ancient one, but has only lately come into existence. Against this system of error there was first a good deal of discussion; then, as the ultimate resource, it was referred to sundry episcopal councils, the proceedings of which, not, indeed, in every instance, but in some, I have despatched to you for your perusal.

Writing to the Corinthians, he admonished married persons not to defraud each other; and then, after his admonition to these, he added: \"But I could wish that all men were even as I am myself,\"[fn-59-P5958_2327534:52-nf] -meaning, of course, that he abstained from all cohabitation; and then proceeded to say: \"But every man hath his own gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.\"[fn-59-P5959_2327732:53-nf] Now, do the many precepts which are written in the law of God, forbidding all fornication and adultery, indicate anything else than free will? Surely such precepts would not be given unless a man had a will of his own, wherewith to obey the divine commandments. And yet it is God's gift which is indispensable for the observance of the precepts of chastity. Accordingly, it is said in the Book of Wisdom: \"When I knew that no one could be continent, except God gives it, then this became a point of wisdom to know whose gift it was.\"[fn-59-P5960_2328286:54-nf] \"Every man,\" however, \"is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed\"[fn-59-P5961_2328393:55-nf] not to observe and keep these holy precepts of chastity.

If our Saviour had only said, \"Watch that ye enter not into temptation,\" He would appear to have done nothing further than admonish man's will; but since He added the words, \"and pray,\" He showed that God helps us not to enter into temptation.

Here, possibly, the Pelagians think they have a justification for their opinion which they so prominently advance, that God's grace is given according to our merits. In the East, indeed, that is to say, in the province of Palestine, in which is the city of Jerusalem, Pelagius, when examined in person by the bishop,[fn-59-P5975_2331779:63-nf] did not venture to affirm this.

He pronounced, indeed, the required anathema upon the dogma, but how insincerely his later books plainly show; for in them he maintains absolutely no other opinion than that the grace of God is given according to our merits. Such passages do they collect out of the Scriptures,-like the one which I just now quoted, \"Turn ye unto me, and I will turn unto you,\"-as if it were owing to the merit of our turning to God that His grace were given us, wherein He Himself even turns unto us.

His words are: \"The law worketh wrath.\"[fn-60-P6072_2356633:124-nf] The reason of this statement lies in the fact that God's wrath is greater in the case of the transgressor who by the law knows sin, and yet commits it; such a man is thus a transgressor of the law, even as the apostle says in another sentence,\" For where no law is, there is no transgression.\"[fn-60-P6073_2356947:125-nf] It is in accordance with this principle that he elsewhere says, \"That we may serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter;\"[fn-60-P6074_2357111:126-nf] wishing the law to be here understood :,by \"the oldness of the letter,\" and what else by \"newness of spirit\" than grace? Then, that it might not be thought that he had brought any accusation, or suggested any blame, against the law, he immediately takes himself to task with this inquiry: \"What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? God forbid.\" He then adds the statement: \"Nay, I had not known sin but by the law;\"[fn-60-P6075_2357546:127-nf] which is of the same import as the passage above quoted: \"By the law is the knowledge of sin.\"[fn-60-P6076_2357665:128-nf] Then: \"For I had not known lust,\" he says, \"except the law had said, `Thou shalt not covet.'\"[fn-60-P6077_2357780:129-nf] But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead. For I was alive without the law once; but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death. For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me. Wherefore the law is holy; and the commandment holy, just, and good. Was, then, that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, worked death in me by that which is good,-in order that the sinner, or[fn-60-P6078_2358404:130-nf] the sin, might by the commandment become beyond measure.\"[fn-60-P6079_2358658:131-nf] And to the Galatians he writes: \"Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, except through faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.\"[fn-60-P6080_2358994:132-nf] ","index":"99","references":[{"fn":"60","code":"P6071_2356339","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. iii. 20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":3,"verses":[20]}]},{"fn":"60","code":"P6072_2356633","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. iv. 15.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":4,"verses":[15]}]},{"fn":"60","code":"P6073_2356947","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. iv. 15.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":4,"verses":[15]}]},{"fn":"60","code":"P6074_2357111","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. vii. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":7,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"60","code":"P6075_2357546","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. vii. 6, 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":7,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"60","code":"P6076_2357665","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. iii. 20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":3,"verses":[20]}]},{"fn":"60","code":"P6077_2357780","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Ex. xx. 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"exodus","chapter":20,"verses":[17]}]},{"fn":"60","code":"P6078_2358404","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"This odd reading probably arose from mistaking the Greek article h0 for the disjunctive particle h_.

And that you may know that he designated as theirs the righteousness which is of the law, and as God's that which man receives from God, hear what he says in another passage, when speaking of Christ: \"For whose sake I counted all things not only as loss, but I deemed them to be dung, that I might win Christ, and be found in Him-not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, which is of God.\"[fn-60-P6091_2362801:137-nf] Now what does he mean by \"not having my own righteousness, which is of the law,\" when the law is really not his at all, but God's,-except this, that he called it his own righteousness, although it was of the law, because he thought he could fulfil the law by his own will, without the aid of grace which is through faith in Christ?

Well, but if the law is not grace, seeing that in order that the law itself may be kept, it is not the law, but only grace which can give help, will not nature at any rate be grace?

This, however, is not the grace which the apostle commends to us through the faith of Jesus Christ.

But God commands some things which we cannot do, in order that we may know what we ought to ask of Him. For this is faith itself, which obtains by prayer what the law commands. He, indeed, who said, \"If thou wilt, thou shalt keep the commandments,\" did in the same book of Ecclesiasticus afterwards say, \"Who shall give a watch before my mouth, and a seal of wisdom upon my lips, that I fall not suddenly thereby, and that my tongue destroy me not.\"[fn-61-P6145_2380484:167-nf] Now he had certainly heard and received these commandments: \"Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.\"[fn-61-P6146_2380632:168-nf] Forasmuch, then, as what he said is true: \"If thou wilt, thou shalt keep the commandments,\" why does he want a watch to be given before his mouth, like him who says in the Psalm, \"Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth \"?[fn-61-P6147_2380874:169-nf] Why is he not satisfied with God's commandment and his own will; since, if he has the will, he shall keep the commandments How many of God's commandments are directed against pride!

It is certain that it is we that will when we will, but it is He who makes us will what is good, of whom it is said (as he has just now expressed it), \"The will is prepared by the Lord.\"[fn-61-P6152_2382471:174-nf] Of the same Lord it is said, \"The steps of a man are ordered by the Lord, and his way doth He will.\"[fn-61-P6153_2382595:175-nf] Of the same Lord again it is said, \"It is God who worketh inyou, even to will!\"[fn-61-P6154_2382698:176-nf] It is certain that it is we that act when we act; but it is He who makes us act, by applying efficacious powers to our will, who has said, \"I will make you to walk in my statutes, and to observe my judgments, and to do them.\"[fn-61-P6155_2382945:177-nf] When he says, \"I will make you . . . to do them,\" what else does He say in fact than, \"I will take away from you your heart of stone,\"[fn-61-P6156_2383104:178-nf] from which used to arise your inability to act, \"and I will give you a heart of flesh,\"[fn-61-P6157_2383228:179-nf] in order that you may act?

But forasmuch as these precepts are given in the law, both old and new (although in the new came the grace which was promised in the old, but the law without grace is the letter which killeth, but in grace the Spirit which giveth life), from what source is there in men the love of God and of one's neighbour but from God Himself?

I think, too, that I have so discussed the subject, that it is not so much I myself as the inspired Scripture which has spoken to you, in the clearest testimonies of truth; and if this divine record be looked into carefully, it shows us that not only men's good wills, which God Himself converts from bad ones, and, when converted by Him, directs to good actions and to eternal life, but also those which follow the world are so entirely at the disposal of God, that He turns them whithersoever He wills, and whensoever He wills,-to bestow kindness on some, and to heap punishment on others, as He Himself judges right by a counsel most secret to Himself, indeed, but beyond all doubt most righteous. For we find that some sins are even the punishment of other sins, as are those \"vessels of wrath\" which the apostle describes as \"fitted to destruction;\"[fn-62-P6246_2403447:241-nf] as is also that hardening of Pharaoh, the purpose of which is said to be to set forth in him the power of God;[fn-62-P6247_2403578:242-nf] as, again, is the flight of the Israelites from the face of the enemy before the city of Ai, for fear arose in their heart so that they fled, and this was done that their sin might be punished in the way it was right that it should be; by reason of which the Lord said to Joshua the son of Nun, \"The children of Israel shall not be able to stand before the face of their enemies.\"[fn-62-P6248_2403992:243-nf] What is the meaning of, \"They shall not be able to stand\"? Now, whydid they not stand by free will, but, with a will perplexed by fear, took to flight, were it not that God has the lordship even over men's wills, and when He is angry turns to fear whomsoever He pleases? Was it not of their own will that the enemies of the children of Israel fought against the people of God, as led by Joshua, the son of Nun? And yet the Scripture says, \"It was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that they might be exterminated,\"[fn-62-P6249_2404586:244-nf] And was it not likewise of his own will that the wicked son of Gera cursed King David? And yet what says David, full of true, and deep, and pious wisdom? What did he say to him who wanted to smite the reviler? \"What,\" said he, \"have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? Let him alone and let him curse, because the Lord hath said unto him, Curse David. Who, then, shall say, Wherefore hast thou done so?\"[fn-62-P6250_2405013:245-nf] And then the inspired Scripture, as if it would confirm the king's profound utterance by repeating it once more, tells us: \"And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more may this Benjamite do it! Let him alone, and let him curse; for the Lord hath hidden him. It may be that, the Lord will look on my humiliation, and will: requite me good for his cursing this day.\"[fn-62-P6251_2405492:246-nf] Now what prudent reader will fail to understand in what way the Lord bade this profane man to curse David? It was not by a command that He bade him, inwhich case his obedience would be praiseworthy; but He inclined the man's will, which had become debased by his own perverseness, to commit this sin, by His own just and secret judgment. :Therefore it is said, \"The Lord said unto him.\" Now if this person had obeyed a command of God, he would have deserved to be praised rather than punished, as we know he was afterwards punished for this sin. Nor is the reason an obscure one why the Lord told him after this manner to curse David. \"It may be,\" said the humbled king, \"that the Lord will look on my humiliation, and will requite me good for his cursing this day.\" See, then, what proof we have here that God uses the hearts of even wicked men for the praise and assistance of the good. Thus did He make use of Judas when betraying Christ; thus did He make use of the Jews when they crucified Christ. And how vast the blessings which from these instances He has bestowed upon the nations that should believe in Him! He also uses our worst enemy, the devil himself, but in the best way, to exercise and try the faith and piety of good men,-not for Himself indeed, who knows all things before they come to pass, but for our sakes, for whom it was necessary that such a discipline should be gone through with us. Did not Absalom choose by his own will the counsel which was detrimental to him? And yet the reason of his doing so was that the Lord had heard his father's prayer that it might be so. Wherefore the Scripture says that \"the Lord appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the Lord might bring all evils upon Absalom.\"[fn-62-P6252_2407277:247-nf] It called Ahithophel's counsel \"good,\" because it was for the moment of advantage to his purpose. It was in favour of the son against his father, against whom he had rebelled; and it might have crashed him, had not the Lord defeated the counsel which Ahithophel had given, by acting on the heart of Absalom so that he rejected this counsel, and chose another which was not expedient for him.","index":"137","references":[{"fn":"62","code":"P6246_2403447","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. ix. 22.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":9,"verses":[22]}]},{"fn":"62","code":"P6247_2403578","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"See Ex. vii. 3, and x. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"exodus","chapter":7,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"62","code":"P6248_2403992","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"See Josh. vii. 4, 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"joshua","chapter":7,"verses":[4]}]},{"fn":"62","code":"P6249_2404586","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Josh. xi. 20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"joshua","chapter":11,"verses":[20]}]},{"fn":"62","code":"P6250_2405013","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"2 Sam. xvi. 9, 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 samuel","chapter":16,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"62","code":"P6251_2405492","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"2 Sam. xvi. 11, 12","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 samuel","chapter":16,"verses":[11]}]},{"fn":"62","code":"P6252_2407277","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"2 Sam. xvii. 14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 samuel","chapter":17,"verses":[14]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 45 [XXI]-God Does Whatsoever He Wills in the Hearts of Even Wicked Men.","index":44,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Who can help trembling at those judgments of God by which He does in the hearts of even wicked men whatsoever He wills, at the same time rendering to them according to their deeds? Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, rejected the salutary counsel of the old men, not to deal harshly with the people, and preferred listening to the words of the. young men of his own age, by returning a rough answer to those to whom he should have spoken gently. Now whence arose such conduct, except from his own will? Upon this, however, the ten tribes of Israel revolted from him, and chose for themselves another king, even Jeroboam, that the will of God in His anger might be accomplished which He had predicted would come to pass.[fn-62-P6256_2408485:248-nf] For what says the Scripture? \"The king hearkened not unto the people; for the turning was from the Lord, that He might perform His saying, which the Lord spake to Ahijah the Shilonite concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat.\"[fn-62-P6257_2408734:249-nf] All this, indeed, was done by the will of man, although the turning was from the Lord. Read the books of the Chronicles, and you will find the following passage in the second book: \"Moreover, the Lord stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were neighbours to the Ethiopians; and they came up to the land of Judah, and ravaged it, and carried away all the substance which was found in the king's house.\"[fn-62-P6258_2409206:250-nf] Here it is shown that God stirs up enemies to devastate the countries which He adjudges deserving of such chastisement. Still, did these Philistines and Arabians invade the land of Judah to waste it with no will of their own? Or were their movements so directed by their own will that the Scripture lies which tells us that \"the Lord stirred up their spirit\" to do all this? Both statements to be sure are true, because they both came by their own will, and yet the Lord stirred up their spirit; and this may also with equal truth be stated the other way: The Lord both stirred up their spirit, and yet they came of their own will. For the Almighty sets in motion even in the innermost hearts of men the movement of their will, so that He does through their agency whatsoever He wishes to perform through them,-even He who knows not how to will anything in unrighteousness. What, again, is the purport of that which the man of God said to King Amaziah: \"Let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the Lord is not with Israel, even with all the children of Ephraim: for if thou shalt think to obtain with these, the Lord shall put thee to flight before thine enemies: for God hath power either to strengthen or to put to flight \"?[fn-62-P6259_2410467:251-nf] Now, how does the power of God help some in war by giving them confidence, and put others to flight by injecting fear into them, except it be that He who has made all things according to His own will, in heaven and on earth,[fn-62-P6260_2410719:252-nf] also works in the hearts of men? We read also what Joash, king of Israel, said when he sent a message to Amaziah, king of Judah, who wanted to fight with him. After certain other words, he added, \"Now tarry at home; why dost thou challenge me to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?\"[fn-62-P6261_2411057:253-nf] Then the Scripture has added this sequel: \"But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might be delivered into their hands, because they sought after the gods of Edom.\"[fn-62-P6262_2411262:254-nf] Behold, now, how God, wishing to punish the sin of idolatry, wrought this in this man's heart, with whom He was indeed justly angry, not to listen to sound advice, but to despise it, and go to the battle, in which he with his army was routed. God says by the prophet Ezekiel, \"If the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the Lord have deceived that prophet: I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.\"[fn-62-P6263_2411754:255-nf] Then there is the book of Esther, who was a woman of the people of Israel, and in the land of their captivity became the wife of the foreign King Ahasuerus. In this book it is written, that, being driven by necessity to interpose in behalf of her people, whom the king had ordered to be slain in every part of his dominions, she prayed to the Lord. So strongly was she urged by the necessity of the case, that she even ventured into the royal presence without the king's command, and contrary to her own custom. Now observe what the Scripture says: \"He looked at her like a bull in the vehemence of his indignation; and the queen was afraid, and her colour changed as she fainted; and she bowed herself upon the head of her delicate maiden which went before her. But God turned the king, and transformed his indignation into gentleness.\"[fn-62-P6264_2412613:256-nf] The Scripture says in the Proverbs of Solomon, \"Even as the rush of water, so is the heart of a king in God's hand; He will turn it in whatever way He shall choose.\"[fn-62-P6265_2412822:257-nf] Again, in the 104th Psalm, in reference to the Egyptians, one reads what God did to them: \"And He turned their heart to hate His people, to deal subtilly with His servants.\"[fn-62-P6266_2413017:258-nf] Observe, likewise, what is written in the letters of the apostles. In the Epistle of Paul, the Apostle, to the Romans occur these words: \"Wherefore God gave them up to uncleanness, through the lusts of their own hearts;\"[fn-62-P6267_2413257:259-nf] and a little afterwards: \"For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections;\"[fn-62-P6268_2413357:260-nf] again, in the next passage: \"And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient.\"[fn-62-P6269_2413554:261-nf] So also in his second Epistle to the Thessalonians, the apostle says of sundry persons, \"Inasmuch as they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved; therefore also God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie; that they all might be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.\"[fn-62-P6270_2413920:262-nf] ","index":"139","references":[{"fn":"62","code":"P6256_2408485","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 Kings xii. 8-14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 kings","chapter":12,"verses":[8]}]},{"fn":"62","code":"P6257_2408734","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 Kings xii. 15.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 kings","chapter":12,"verses":[15]}]},{"fn":"62","code":"P6258_2409206","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"2 Chron. xxi. 16, 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 chronicles","chapter":21,"verses":[16]}]},{"fn":"62","code":"P6259_2410467","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"2 Chron. xxv. 7, 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 chronicles","chapter":25,"verses":[7]}]},{"fn":"62","code":"P6260_2410719","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Ps. cxxxv. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":135,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"62","code":"P6261_2411057","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"2 Kings xiv. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 kings","chapter":14,"verses":[10]}]},{"fn":"62","code":"P6262_2411262","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"2 Chron. xxv. 20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 chronicles","chapter":25,"verses":[20]}]},{"fn":"62","code":"P6263_2411754","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Ezek. xiv. 9","bible_refs":[{"book":"ezekiel","chapter":14,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"62","code":"P6264_2412613","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Esther v.

This ought to be the fixed and immoveable conviction of your heart, that there is no unrighteousness with God. Therefore, whenever you read in the Scriptures of Truth, that men are led aside, or that their hearts are blunted and hardened by God, never doubt that some ill deserts of their own have first occurred, so that they justly suffer these things. Thus you will not run counter to that proverb of Solomon: \"The foolishness of a man perverteth his ways, yet he blameth God in his heart.\"[fn-62-P6274_2414931:263-nf] Grace, however, is not bestowed according to men's deserts; otherwise grace would be no longer grace.[fn-62-P6275_2415054:264-nf] For grace is so designated because it is given gratuitously.[fn-62-P6276_2415134:265-nf] Now if God is able, either through the agency of angels (whether good ones or evil), or in any other way whatever, to operate in the hearts even of the wicked, in return for their deserts,-whose wickedness was not made by Him, but was either derived originally from Adam, or increased by their own will,-what is there to wonder at if, through the Holy Spirit, He works good in the hearts of the elect, who has wrought it that their hearts become good instead of evil?","index":"141","references":[{"fn":"62","code":"P6274_2414931","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Prov. xix. 3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","chapter":19,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"62","code":"P6275_2415054","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. xi. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":11,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"62","code":"P6276_2415134","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Latin, gratis.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 44 [XXII.] - Gratuitous Grace Exemplified in Infants.","index":46,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Men, however, may suppose that there are certain good deserts which they think are precedent to justification through God's grace; all the while failing to see, when they express such an opinion, that they do nothing else than deny grace. But, as I have already remarked, let them suppose what they like respecting the case of adults, in the case of infants, at any rate, the Pelagians find no means of answering the difficulty. For these in receiving grace have no will; from the influence of which they can pretend to any precedent merit. We see, moreover, how they cry and struggle when they are baptized, and feel the divine sacraments. Such conduct would, of course, be charged against them as a great impiety, if they already had free will in use; and notwithstanding this, grace cleaves to them even in their resisting struggles. But most certainly there is no prevenient merit, otherwise the grace would be no longer grace. Sometimes, too, this grace is bestowed upon the children of unbelievers, when they happen by some means or other to fall, by reason of God's secret providence, into the hands of pious persons; but, on the other hand, the children of believers fail to obtain grace, some hindrance occurring to prevent the approach of help to rescue them in their danger. These things, no doubt, happen through the secret providence of God, whose judgments are unsearchable, and His ways past finding out. These are the words of the apostle; and you should observe what he had previously said, to lead him to add such a remark. He was discoursing about the Jews and Gentiles, when he wrote to the Romans-themselves Gentiles-to this effect: \"For as ye, in times past, have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief; even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy; for God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that He might have mercy upon all.\"[fn-62-P6280_2417616:266-nf] Now, after he had thought upon what he said, full of wonder at the certain truth of his own assertion, indeed, but astonished at its great depth, how God concluded all in unbelief that He might have mercy upon all,-as if doing evil that good might come,-he at once exclaimed, and said, \"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!\"[fn-62-P6281_2418061:267-nf] Perverse men, who do not reflect upon these unsearchable judgments and untraceable ways, indeed, but are ever prone to censure, being unable to understand, have supposed the apostle to say, and censoriously gloried over him for saying, \"Let us do evil, that good may come!\" God forbid that the apostle should say so! But men, without understanding, have thought that this was in fact said, when they heard these words of the apostle: \"Moreover, the law entered, that the offence might abound; but where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.\"[fn-62-P6282_2418627:268-nf] But grace, indeed, effects this purpose-that good works should now be wrought by those who previously did evil; not that they should persevere in evil courses and suppose that they are recompensed with good. Their language, therefore, ought not to be: \"Let us do evil, that good may come;\" but: \"We have done evil, and good has come; let us henceforth do good, that in the future world we may receive good for good, who in the present life are receiving good for evil.\" Wherefore it is written in the Psalm, \"I will sing of mercy and judgment unto Thee, O Lord.\"[fn-62-P6283_2419209:269-nf] When the Son of man, therefore, first came into the world, it was not to judge the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.[fn-62-P6284_2419364:270-nf] And this dispensation was for mercy; by and by, however, He will come for judgment-to judge the quick and the dead. And yet even in this present time salvation itself does not eventuate without judgment-although it be a hidden one; therefore He says, \"For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not may see, and that they which see may be made blind.\"[fn-62-P6285_2419754:271-nf] ","index":"143","references":[{"fn":"62","code":"P6280_2417616","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. xi. 30-32.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":11,"verses":[30]}]},{"fn":"62","code":"P6281_2418061","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. xi. 33.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":11,"verses":[33]}]},{"fn":"62","code":"P6282_2418627","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. v. 20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":5,"verses":[20]}]},{"fn":"62","code":"P6283_2419209","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Ps. ci. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":101,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"62","code":"P6284_2419364","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"John iii. 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":3,"verses":[17]}]},{"fn":"62","code":"P6285_2419754","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"John ix. 39.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":9,"verses":[39]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 45 [XXIII]-Thereason Way One Person is Assisted by Grace, and Another is Not Helped, Must Be Referred to the Secret Judgments of God.","index":47,"paragraphs":[{"text":"You must refer the matter, then, to the hidden determinations of God, when you see, in one and the same condition, such as all infants unquestionably have,-who derive their hereditary evil from Adam,-that one is assisted so as to be baptized, and another is not assisted, so that he dies in his very bondage; and again, that one baptized person is left and forsaken in his present life, who God foreknew would be ungodly, while another baptized person is taken away from this life,\" lest that wickedness should alter his understanding;\"[fn-62-P6289_2420452:272-nf] and be sure that you do not in such cases ascribe unrighteousness or unwisdom to God, in whom is the very fountain of righteousness and wisdom, but, as I have exhorted you from the commencement of this treatise, \"whereto you have already attained, walk therein,\"[fn-62-P6290_2420736:273-nf] and \"even this shall God reveal unto you,\"[fn-62-P6291_2420800:274-nf] -if not in this life, yet certainly in the next, \"for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed.\"[fn-62-P6292_2420930:275-nf] When, therefore, you hear the Lord say, \"I the Lord have deceived that prophet,\"[fn-62-P6293_2421031:276-nf] and likewise what the apostle says: \"He hath mercy on whom He will have mercy, and whom He will He hardeneth,\"[fn-62-P6294_2421163:277-nf] believe that, in the case of him whom He permits to be deceived and hardened, his evil deeds have deserved the judgment; whilst in the case of him to whom He shows mercy, you should loyally and unhesitatingly recognise the grace of the God who \"rendereth not evil for evil; but contrariwise blessing.\"[fn-62-P6295_2421485:278-nf] Nor should you take away from Pharaoh free will, because in several passages God says, \"I have hardened Pharaoh ;\" or,\" I have hardened or I will harden Pharaoh's heart;\"[fn-62-P6296_2421678:279-nf] for it does not by any means follow that Pharaoh did not, on this account, harden his own heart.

Be ye then well assured that your labour will never be in vain, if, setting before you a good purpose, you persevere in it to the last. For God, who fails to render, according to their deeds, only to those whom He liberates, will then \"recompense every man according to his works.\"[fn-62-P6298_2422420:281-nf] God will, therefore, certainly recompense both evil for evil, because He is just; and good for evil, because He is good; and good for good, because He is good and just; only, evil for good He will never recompense, because He is not unjust. He will, therefore, recompense evil for evil-punishment for un-righteousness; and He will recompense good for evil-grace for unrighteousness; and He will recompense good for good-grace for grace.
