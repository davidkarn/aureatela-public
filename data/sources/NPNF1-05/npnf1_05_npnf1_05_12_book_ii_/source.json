Unbaptized infants it implicates as guilty and as children of wrath, even if they die in infancy, draws into condemnation. In baptized adults, however, endowed with reason, whatever consent their mind gives to this concupiscence for the commission of sin is an act of their own will. After all sins have been blotted out, and that guilt has been cancelled which by nature[fn-7-P745_469153:8-nf] bound men in a conquered condition, it still remains,-but not to hurt in any way those who yield noconsent to it for unlawful deeds,-until deathis swallowed up in victory[fn-7-P746_469366:9-nf] and, in that perfection of peace, nothing is left to be conquered. Such, however, as yield consent to it for the commission of unlawful deeds, it holds as guilty; and unless, through the medicine of repentance, and through works of mercy, by the intercession in our behalf of the heavenly High Priest, they be healed, it conducts us to the second death and utter condemnation.

Of this evil the apostle says: \"I know that in my flesh dwelleth no good thing ;\"[fn-7-P748_470378:11-nf] and it is likewise to the same evil that he counsels us to give no obedience, when he says: \"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, to obey the lusts thereof.\"[fn-7-P749_470567:12-nf] When, therefore, we have by an unlawful inclination of our will yielded consent to these lusts of the flesh, we say, with a view to the cure of this fault, \"Forgive us our debts;\"[fn-7-P750_470765:13-nf] and we at the same time apply the remedy of a work of mercy, in that we add, \"As we forgive our debtors.\" That we may not, however, yield such consent, let us pray for assistance, and say, \"And lead us not into temptation;\"-not that God ever Himself tempts any one with such temptation, \"for God is not a tempter to evil, neither tempteth He any man;\"[fn-7-P751_471136:14-nf] but in order that whenever we feel the rising of temptation from our concupiscence, we may not be deserted by His help, in order that thereby we may be able to conquer, and not be carried away by enticement.

Whether a Man Can Be Without Sin in This Life.","index":9,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Now those who aver that a man can exist in this life without sin, must not be immediately opposed with incautious rashness; for if we should deny the possibility, we should derogate both from the free will of man, who in his wish desires it, and from the power or mercy of God, who by His help effects it. But it is one question, whether he could exist; and another question, whether he does exist. Again, it is one question, if he does not exist when he could exist, why he does not exist; and another question, whether such a man as had never sinned at all, not only is in existence, but also could ever have existed, or can ever exist. Now, if in the order of this fourfold set of interrogative propositions, I were asked, [1st,] Whether it be possible for a man in this life to be without sin? I should allow the possibility, through the grace of God and the man's own free will; not doubting that the free will itself is ascribable to God's grace, in other words, to the gifts of God,-not only as to its existence, but also as to its being good, that is, to its conversion to doing the commandments of God. Thus it is that God's grace not only shows what ought to be done, but also helps to the possibility of doing what it shows. \"What indeed have we that we have not received?\"[fn-7-P776_477563:30-nf] Whence also Jeremiah says: \"I know, O Lord, that the way of man is not in himself; it is not in man to walk and direct his steps.\"[fn-7-P777_477713:31-nf] Accordingly, when in the Psalms one says to God, \"Thou hast commanded me to keep Thy precepts diligently,\"[fn-7-P778_477837:32-nf] he at once adds not a word of confidence concerning himself but a wish to be able to keep these precepts: \"O that my ways,\" says he, \"were directed to keep Thy statutes!

To whom, however, he directs his wish,-not to fortune, or fate, or some one else besides God,-he shows with sufficient clearness in the following words, where he says: \"Order my steps in Thy word; and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.\"[fn-7-P780_478483:34-nf] From the thraldom of this execrable dominion they are liberated, to whom the Lord Jesus gave power to become the sons of God.[fn-7-P781_478629:35-nf] From so horrible a domination were they to be freed, to whom He says, \"If the Son shall make you free, then shall ye be free indeed.\"[fn-7-P782_478780:36-nf] From these and many other like testimonies, I cannot doubt that God has laid no impossible command on man; and that, by God's aid and help, nothing is impossible, by which is wrought what He commands.

For this too the Lord calls a regeneration,-though, of course, not such as occurs through baptism, but still a regeneration wherein that which is now begun in the spirit shall be brought to perfection also in the body. \"In the regeneration,\" says He, \"when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.\"[fn-8-P800_482277:48-nf] For however entire and full be the remission of sins in baptism, nevertheless, if there was wrought by it at once, an entire and full change of the man into his everlasting newness,-I do not mean change in his body, which is now most clearly tending evermore to the old corruption and to death, after which it is to be renewed into a total and true newness,-but, the body being excepted, if in the soul itself, which is the inner man, a perfect renewal was wrought in baptism, the apostle would not say: \"Even though our outward man perishes, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.\"[fn-8-P801_482884:49-nf] Now, undoubtedly, he who is still renewed day by day is not as yet wholly renewed; and in so far as he is not yet wholly renewed, he is still in his old state. Since, then, men, even after they are baptized, are still in some degree in their old condition, they are on that account also still children of the world; but inasmuch as they are also admitted into a new state, that is to say, by the full and perfect remission of their sins, and in so far as they are spiritually-minded, and behave correspondingly, they are the children of God. Internally we put off the old man and put on the new; for we then and there lay aside lying, and speak truth, and do those other things wherein the apostle makes to consist the putting off of the old man and the putting on of the new, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness[fn-8-P802_483743:50-nf] Now it is men who are already baptized and faithful whom he exhorts to do this,-an exhortation which would be unsuitable to them, if the absolute and perfect change had been already made in their baptism. And yet made it was, since we were then actually saved; for \"He saved us by the laver of regeneration.\"[fn-8-P803_484070:51-nf] In another passage, however, he tells us how this took place. \"Not they only,\" says he, \"but ourselves also, which have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.\"[fn-8-P804_484528:52-nf] ","index":"79","references":[{"fn":"7","code":"P797_481044","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 John iii. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 john","chapter":3,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"7","code":"P798_481373","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"See Col. iii. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"colossians","chapter":3,"verses":[10]}]},{"fn":"7","code":"P799_481704","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Donec etiam in re fiant.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"8","code":"P800_482277","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Matt. xix. 28.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":19,"verses":[28]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P801_482884","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"2 Cor. iv. 16.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":4,"verses":[16]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P802_483743","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Eph. iv. 24.","bible_refs":[{"book":"ephesians","chapter":4,"verses":[24]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P803_484070","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Tit. iii. 5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"titus","chapter":3,"verses":[5]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P804_484528","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Rom. viii. 23-25.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":8,"verses":[23]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 10 [VIII.]-Perfection, When to Be Realized.","index":12,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Our full adoption, then, as children, is to happen at the redemption of our body.

His begetting children, therefore, shows that he still retains the old nature among the children of this world; it does not arise from the fact of his promotion to newness of life among the children of God.

It follows, therefore, that every son who is born in this old and infirm condition of his father's nature, must needs himself partake of the same old and infirm condition. In order, then, that he may be begotten again, he must also himself be renewed by the Spirit through the remission of sin; and if this change does not take place in him, his righteous father will be of no use to him. For it is by the Spirit that he is righteous, but it is not by the Spirit that he begat his son. On the other hand, if this change does accrue to him, he will not be damaged by an unrighteous father: for it is by the grace of the Spirit that he has passed into the hope of the eternal newness; whereas it is owing to his carnal mind that his father has wholly remained in the old nature.","index":"83","references":[{"fn":"8","code":"P817_487715","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Luke xx. 34.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":20,"verses":[34]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P818_487827","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"John iii. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":3,"verses":[6]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 12 [X.]-He Reconciles Some Passages of Scripture.","index":14,"paragraphs":[{"text":"The statement, therefore, \"He that is born of God sinneth not,\"[fn-8-P822_489158:61-nf] is not contrary to the passage in which it is declared by those who are born of God, \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\"[fn-8-P823_489346:62-nf] For however complete may be a man's present hope, and however real may be his renewal by spiritual regeneration in that part of his nature, he still, for all that, carries about a body which is corrupt, and which presses down his soul; and so long as this is the case, one must distinguish even in the same individual the relation and source of each several action. Now, I suppose it is not easy to find in God's Scripture so weighty a testimony of holiness given of any man as that which is written of His three servants, Noah, Daniel, and Job, whom the Prophet Ezekiel describes as the only men able to be delivered from God's impending wrath.[fn-8-P824_490010:63-nf] In these three men he no doubt prefigures three classes of mankind to be delivered: in Noah, as I suppose, are represented righteous leaders of nations, by reason of his government of the ark as a type of the Church; in Daniel, men who are righteous in continence; in Job, those who are righteous in wedlock; - to say nothing of any other view of the passage, which it is unnecessary now to consider. It is, at any rate, clear from this testimony of the prophet, and from other inspired statements, how eminent were these worthies in righteousness. Yet no man must be led by their history to say, for instance, that drunkenness is not sin, although so good a man was overtaken by it; for we read that Noah was once drunk,[fn-8-P825_490752:64-nf] but God forbid that it should be thought that he was an habitual drunkard.","index":"85","references":[{"fn":"8","code":"P822_489158","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 John iii. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 john","chapter":3,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P823_489346","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 John i. 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 john","chapter":1,"verses":[8]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P824_490010","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Ezek. xiv. 14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"ezekiel","chapter":14,"verses":[14]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P825_490752","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Gen. ix. 21.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":9,"verses":[21]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 13.-A Subterfuge of the Pelagians.","index":15,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Daniel, indeed, after the prayer which he poured out before God, actually says respecting himself, \"Whilst I was praying and confessing my sins, and the sins of my people, before the Lord my God.\"[fn-8-P829_491083:65-nf] This is the reason, if I am not mistaken, why in the above-mentioned Prophet Ezekiel a certain most haughty person is asked, \"Art thou then wiser than Daniel?\"[fn-8-P830_491261:66-nf] Nor on this point can that be possibly said which some contend for in opposition to the Lord's Prayer: \"For although,\" they say, \"that prayer was offered by the apostles, after they became holy and perfect, and had no sin whatever, yet it was not in behalf of their own selves, but of imperfect and still sinful men that they said, 'Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.'

How great a man indeed Job was, we are not told; but we know that he was a just man; we know, too, that in the endurance of terrible afflictions and trials he was great; and we know that it was not on account of his sins, but for the purpose of demonstrating his righteousness, that he had to bear so much suffering.

For there was not one law for him and another for them previous to the gospel. It was one and the same law which, as we read, was given by Moses to their fathers, and according to which, also, Zacharias was priest, and offered sacrifices in his course. And yet the apostle, who was then endued with the like righteousness, goes on to say: \"But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ; for whose sake I have not only thought all things to be only detriments, but I have even counted them as dung, that I may win Christ, and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith: that I may know Him, and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His suffering, being made comformable unto His death; if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-8-P880_507247:95-nf] So far, then, is it from being true that we should, from the words in which Scripture describes them, suppose that Zacharias and Elisabeth had a perfect righteousness without any sin, that we must even regard the apostle himself, according to the selfsame rule, as not perfect, not only in that righteousness of the law which he possessed in common with them, and which he counts as loss and dung in comparison with that most excellent righteousness which is by the faith of Christ, but also in the very gospel itself, wherein he deserved the pre-eminence of his great apostleship. Now I would not venture to say this if I did not deem it very wrong to refuse credence to himself. He extends the passage which we have quoted, and says: \"Not as though I had already attained, or were already perfect; but I follow after, if I may comprehend that for which also I am apprehended in Christ Jesus. Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.\"[fn-8-P881_508419:96-nf] Here he confesses that he has not yet attained, and is not yet perfect in that plenitude of righteousness which he had longed to obtain in Christ; but that he was as yet pressing towards the mark, and, forgetting what was past, was reaching out to the things which are before him. We are sure, then, that what he says elsewhere is true even of himself: \"Although our outward man is perishing, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.\"[fn-8-P882_508879:97-nf] Although he was already a perfect[fn-8-P883_508934:98-nf] traveller, he had not yet attained the perfect end of his journey. All such he would fain take with him as companions of his course. This he expresses in the words which follow our former quotation: \"Let as many, then, of us as are perfect, be thus minded: and if ye be yet of another mind, God will reveal even this also to you. Nevertheless, whereunto we have already attained, let us walk by that rule.\"[fn-8-P884_509389:99-nf] This \"walk\" is not performed with the legs of the body, but with the affections, of the soul and the character of the life, so that they who possess righteousness may arrive at perfection, who, advancing in their renewal day by day along the straight path of faith, have by this time become perfect as travellers in the selfsame righteousness.","index":"101","references":[{"fn":"8","code":"P878_505694","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Phil. iii. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"philippians","chapter":3,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P879_505853","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"See also his work, De Gratia Christi, 53.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"8","code":"P880_507247","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Phil. iii. 7-11.","bible_refs":[{"book":"philippians","chapter":3,"verses":[7]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P881_508419","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Phil. iii. 12-14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"philippians","chapter":3,"verses":[12]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P882_508879","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"2 Cor. iv. 16.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":4,"verses":[16]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P883_508934","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Augustin plays on the word \"perfect.\"-W.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"8","code":"P884_509389","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Phil. iii. 15, 16.","bible_refs":[{"book":"philippians","chapter":3,"verses":[15]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 21 [XIV.]-All Righteous Men Sinners.","index":23,"paragraphs":[{"text":"In like manner, all who are described in the Scriptures as exhibiting in their present life good will and the actions of righteousness, and all whohave lived like them since, although lacking the same testimony of Scripture; or all who are even now so living, or shall hereafter so live: all these are great, they are all righteous, and they are all really worthy of praise, - yet they are by no means without sin: inasmuch as, on the authority of the same Scriptures which make us believe in their virtues, we believe also that in \"God's sight no man living is justified,\"[fn-8-P888_510375:100-nf] whence all ask that He will \"not enter into judgment with His servants:\"[fn-8-P889_510470:101-nf] and that not only to all the faithful in general, but to each of them in particular, the Lord's Prayer is necessary, which He delivered to His disciples.[fn-8-P890_510646:102-nf] ","index":"103","references":[{"fn":"8","code":"P888_510375","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Ps. cxliii. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":143,"verses":[2]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P889_510470","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Ps. cxliii. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":143,"verses":[2]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P890_510646","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Matt. vi. 12; Luke xi. 4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":6,"verses":[12]},{"book":"luke","chapter":11,"verses":[4]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":6,"verses":[12]},{"book":"luke","chapter":11,"verses":[4]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 22 [XV.]-An Objection of the Pelagians; Perfection is Relative; He is Rightly Said to Be Perfect in Righteousness Who Has Made Much Progress Therein.","index":24,"paragraphs":[{"text":"\"Well, but,\" they say, \"the Lord says, `Be ye perfect even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect,'[fn-8-P894_510942:103-nf] -an injunction which He would not have given, if He had known that what He enjoined was impracticable.\" Now the present question is not whether it be possible for anymen, during this present life, to be without sin if they receive that perfection for the purpose; for the question of possibility we have already discussed:[fn-8-P895_511284:104-nf] -but what we have now to consider is, whether any man in fact achieves perfection. We have, however, already recognised the fact that no man wills as much as the duty demands, as also the testimony of the Scriptures, which we have quoted so largely above, declares. When, indeed, perfection is ascribed to any particular person; we must look carefully at the thing in which it is ascribed. For I have just above quoted a passage of the apostle, wherein he confesses that he was not yet perfect in the attainment of righteousness which he desired; but still he immediately adds, \"Let as many of us as are perfect be thus minded.\" Now he would certainly not have uttered these two sentences if he had not been perfect in one thing, and not in another. For instance, a man may be perfect as a scholar in the pursuit of wisdom: and this could not yet be said of those to whom [the apostle] said, \"I have fed you with milk, sand not with meat: for hitherto ye have notbeen able to bear it, neither are ye yet able;\"[fn-8-P896_512322:105-nf] whereas to those of whom it could be said he says,\" Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect,\" -meaning, of course, \"perfect pupils\" to be understood. It may happen, therefore, as I have said, that a man may be already perfect as a scholar, though not as yet perfect as a teacher of wisdom; may be perfect as a learner, though not as yet perfect as a doer of righteousness; may be perfect as a lover of his enemies, though not as yet perfect in bearing their wrong.[fn-8-P897_512821:106-nf] Even in the case of him who is so far perfect as to love all men, inasmuch as he has attained even to the love of his enemies, it still remains a question whether he be perfect in that love,-in other words, whether he so loves those whom he loves as is prescribed to be exercised towards those to be loved, by the unchangeable love of truth. Whenever, then, we read in the Scriptures of any man's perfection, it must be carefully considered in what it is asserted, since a man is not therefore to be understood as being entirely without sin because he is described as perfect in some particular thing; although the term may also be employed to show, not, indeed, that there is no longer any point left for a man to reach his way to perfection, but that he has in fact advanced a very great way, and on that account may be deemed worthy of the designation. Thus, a man may be said to be perfect in the science of the law, even if there be still something unknown to him; and in the same manner the apostle called men perfect, to whom he said at the same time, \"Yet if in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this to you. Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule.\"[fn-8-P898_514095:107-nf] ","index":"105","references":[{"fn":"8","code":"P894_510942","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Matt v. 48.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":5,"verses":[48]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P895_511284","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"See above, chap. 7.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"8","code":"P896_512322","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"1 Cor. iii. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":3,"verses":[2]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P897_512821","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Ut sufferat is his antithesis here to ut diligat.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"8","code":"P898_514095","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Phil. iii. 15.","bible_refs":[{"book":"philippians","chapter":3,"verses":[15]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 23 [XXI.]-Why God Prescribes What He Knows Cannot Be Observed.","index":25,"paragraphs":[{"text":"We must not deny that God commands that we ought to be so perfect in doing righteousness, as to have no sin at all.

In this manner it may also be asked, Why He commanded the first human beings, who were only two, what He knew they would not obey? For it must not be pretended that He issued that command, that some of us might obey it, if they did not; for, that they should not partake of the fruit of the particular tree, God commanded them, and none besides. Because, as He knew what amount of righteousness they would fail to perform, so did He also know what righteous measures He meant Himself to adopt concerning them. In the same way, then, He orders all men to commit no sin, although He knows beforehand that no man will fulfil the command; in order that He may, in the case of all who impiously and condemnably despise His precepts, Himself do what is just in their condemnation; and, in the case of all who while obediently and piously pressing on in his precepts, though failing to observe to the utmost all things which He has enjoined, do yet forgive others as they wish to t be forgiven themselves, Himself do what is good in their cleansing.

If, however, he uttered such words of joy feeling sure and secure, because he had been made sure and secure by Him who had revealed to him the imminence of his suffering, then he spoke these words, not in the fulness of realization, but in the firmness of hope, and represents what he foresees is to come as if it had already been done. If, therefore, he had added to those words the further statement, \"I have no longer any sin,\" we must have understood him as even then speaking of a perfection arising from a future prospect, not from an accomplished fact. For his having no sin, which they suppose was completed when he spoke these words, pertained to the finishing of his course; just in the same way as his triumphing over his adversary in the decisive conflict of his suffering had also reference to the finishing of his course, although this they must needs themselves allow remained yet to be effected, when he was speaking these words. The whole of this, therefore, We declare to have been as yet awaiting its accomplishment, at the time when the apostle, with his perfect trust in the promise of God, spoke of it all as having been already realized. For it was in reference to the finishing of his course that he forgave the sins of those who sinned against him, and prayed that his own sins might in like manner be forgiven him; and it was in his most certain confidence in this promise of the Lord, that he believed he should have no sin in that last end, which was still future, even when in his trustfulness he spoke of it as already accomplished. Now, omitting all other considerations, I wonder whether, when he uttered the words in which he is thought to imply that he had no sin, that \"thorn of the flesh\" had been already removed from him, for the taking away of which he had three times entreated the Lord, and had received thisanswer: \"My grace is sufficient for thee; for my strength is made perfect in weakness.\"[fn-9-P907_518378:110-nf] For bringing so great a man to perfection, it was needful that that \"messenger of Satan\" should not be taken away by whom he was therefore to be buffeted, \"lest he should be unduly exalted by the abundance of his revelations,\"[fn-9-P908_518630:111-nf] and is there then any man so bold as either to think or to say, that any one who has to bend beneath the burden of this life is altogether clean from all sin whatever?","index":"109","references":[{"fn":"9","code":"P905_515970","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"2 Tim. iv. 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 timothy","chapter":4,"verses":[7]}]},{"fn":"9","code":"P906_516257","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"2 Tim. iv. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 timothy","chapter":4,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"9","code":"P907_518378","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"2 Cor. xii. 8, 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":12,"verses":[8]}]},{"fn":"9","code":"P908_518630","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"2 Cor. xii. 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":12,"verses":[7]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 25.-God Punishes Both in Wrath and in Mercy.","index":27,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Although there are some men who are so eminent in righteousness that God speaks to them out of His cloudy pillar, such as \"Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among them that call upon His name,\"[fn-9-P912_519077:112-nf] the latter of whom is much praised for his piety and purity in the Scriptures of truth, from his earliest childhood, in which his mother, to accomplish her vow, placed him in God's temple, and devoted him to the Lord as His servant;-yet even of such men it is written, \"Thou, O God, wast propitious unto them, though Thou didst punish all their devices.\"[fn-9-P913_519453:113-nf] Now the children of wrath God punishes in anger; whereas it is in mercy that He punishes the children of grace; since \"whom He loveth He correcteth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth.\"[fn-9-P914_519666:114-nf] However, there are no punishments, no correction, no scourge of God, but what are owing to sin, except in the case of Him who prepared His back for the smiter, in order that He might experience all things in our likeness without sin, in order that He might be the saintly Priest of saints, making intercession even for saints, who with no sacrifice of truth say each one even for himself, \"Forgive us our trespasses, even as we also forgive them that trespass against us.\"[fn-9-P915_520174:115-nf] Wherefore even our opponents in this controversy, whilst they are chaste in their life, and commendable in character, and although they do not hesitate to do that which the Lord enjoined on the rich man, who inquired of Him about the attainment of eternal life, after he had told Him, in answer to His first question, that he had already fully kept every commandment in the law, - that \"if he wished to be perfect, he must sell all that he had and give to the poor, and transfer his treasure to heaven;\"[fn-9-P916_520715:116-nf] yet they do not in any one instance venture to say that they are without sin.

Since by divine grace assisting the human will, man may possibly exist in this life without sin, why does he not? To this question I might very easily and truthfully answer: Because men are unwilling. But if I am asked why they are unwilling, we are drawn into a lengthy statement. And yet, without prejudice to a more careful examination, I may briefly say this much: Men are unwilling to do what is right, either because what is right is unknown to them, or because it is unpleasant to them. For we desire a thing more ardently in proportion to the certainty of our knowledge of its goodness, and the warmth of our delight in it. Ignorance, therefore, and infirmity are faults which impede the will from moving either for doing a good work, or for refraining from an evil one. But that what was hidden may come to light, and what was unpleasant may be made agreeable, is of the grace of God which helps the wills of men; and that they are not helped by it, has its cause likewise in themselves, not in God, whether they be predestinated to condemnation, on account of the iniquity of their pride, or whether they are to be judged and disciplined contrary to their very pride, if they are children of mercy.

It is this: Whether the man who never has had sin or is to have it, not merely is now living as one of the sons of men, but even could ever have existed at any time, or will yet in time to come exist? Now it is altogether most certain that such a man neither does now live, nor has lived, nor ever will live, except the one only Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus. we have already said a good deal on this subject in our remarks on the baptism of infants; for if these have no sin, not only are there at present, but also there have been, and there will be, persons innumerable without sin. Now if the point which we treated of under the second head be truly substantiated, that there is in fact no man without sin,[fn-9-P970_535541:143-nf] then of course not even infants are without sin. From which the conclusion arises, that even supposing a man could possibly exist in the present life so far advanced in virtue as to have reached the perfect fulness of holy living which is absolutely free from sin, he still must have been undoubtedly a sinner previously, and have been converted from the sinful state to this subsequent newness oflife. Now when we were discussing the second head, a different question was before us from that which is before us under this fourth head. For then the point we had to consider was, Whether any man in this life could ever attain to such perfection as to be absolutely without sin by the grace of God, by the hearty desire of his own will? whereas the question now proposed in this fourth place is, Whether there be among the sons of men, or could possibly ever have been, or yet ever can be, a man who has not indeed emerged out of sin and attained to perfect righteousness, but has never, at any time whatever, been under the bondage of sin? If, therefore, the remarks are true which we have made at so great length concerning infants, there neither is, has been, nor will be, among the sons of men any such man, except the one Mediator, in whom there accrues to us propitiation and justification through which we have reconciliation with God, by the termination of the enmity produced by our sins.

For what could be more absurd than to suppose that they partook of the fruit of other trees, but not of that which had been equally with others granted to them, and which, by its especial virtue, prevented even their animal bodies from undergoing change through the decay of age, and from aging into death, applying this benefit from its own body to the man's body, and in a mystery demonstrating what is conferred by wisdom (which it symbolized) on the rational soul, even that, quickened by its fruit, it should not be changed into the decay and death of iniquity?

He, therefore, alone having become man, but still continuing to be God, never had any sin, nor did he assume a flesh of sin, though born of a maternal[fn-9-P996_547969:157-nf] flesh of sin.

His virgin mother, therefore, whose conception was not according to the law of sinful flesh (in other words, not by the excitement of carnal concupiscence), but who merited by her faith that the holy seed should be framed within her, He formed in order to choose her, and chose in order to be formed from her.

[XXVI.] Sanctification is not of merely one measure; for even catechumens, I take it, are sanctified in their own measure by the sign of Christ, and the prayer of imposition of hands; and what they receive is holy, although it is not the body of Christ, - holier than any food which constitutes our ordinary nourishment, because it is a sacrament.[fn-10-P1015_554411:164-nf] However, that very meat and drink, wherewithal the necessities of our present life are sustained, are, according to the same apostle, \"sanctified by the word of God and prayer,\"[fn-10-P1016_555041:165-nf] even the prayer with which we beg that our bodies may be refreshed.

But the sacrament of baptism is undoubtedly the sacrament of regenation: Wherefore, as the man who has never lived cannot die, and he who has never died cannot rise again, so he who has never been born cannot be born again.

There is, however, so clear a distinction to be seen between this old carnal nature, in which the law of sin, or sin, is already repealed, and that life of the Spirit, in the newness of which they who are baptized are through God's grace born again, that the apostle deemed it too little to say of such that they were not in sin; unless he also said that they were not in the flesh itself, even before they departed out of this mortal life. \"They that are in the flesh,\" says he, \"cannot please God; but ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.\"[fn-10-P1032_561438:172-nf] And indeed, as they turn to good account the flesh itself, however corruptible it be, who apply its members to good works, and no longer are in that flesh, since they do not mould their understanding nor their life according to its principles; and as they in like manner make even a good use of death, which is the penalty of the first sin, who encounter it with fortitude and patience for their brethren's sake, and for the faith, and in defence of whatever is true and holy and just, - so also do all \"true yokefellows\" in the faith turn to good account that very law of sin which still remains, though remitted, in their old carnal nature, who, because they have the new life in Christ, do not permit lust to have dominion over them.
