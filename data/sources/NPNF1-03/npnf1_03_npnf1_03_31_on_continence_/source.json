IT is difficult to treat of the virtue of the soul, which is called Continence, in a manner fully suitable and worthy; but He, whose great gift this virtue is, will help our littleness under the burden of so great a weight. For He, who bestows it upon His faithful ones when they are continent, Himself gives discourse of it to His ministers when they speak. Lastly, of so great a matter purposing to speak what Himself shall grant, in the first place we say and prove that Continence is the gift of God.[fn-35-P3575_1688581:1-nf] We have it written in the Book of Wisdom, that no one can be continent, unless God grant it. But the Lord, concerning that greater and more glorious Continence itself, whereby there is continence from the marriage bond, says, \"Not all can receive this saying, but they to whom it is given.\"[fn-35-P3576_1688890:2-nf] And since marriage chastity also itself cannot be guarded, unless there be Continence from unlawful intercourse, the Apostle declared both to be the gift of God, when He spake of both lives, that is, both that of marriage and that without marriage, saying, \"I would that all men were so as myself; but each. hath his own gift from God; one in this manner, another in that manner.\"[fn-35-P3577_1689289:3-nf] ","index":"6","references":[{"fn":"35","code":"P3575_1688581","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Wis. viii. 21.","bible_refs":[{"book":"wisdom","chapter":8,"verses":[21]}]},{"fn":"35","code":"P3576_1688890","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Matt. xix. 11.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":19,"verses":[11]}]},{"fn":"35","code":"P3577_1689289","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"1 Cor. vii. 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":7,"verses":[7]}]}]},{"text":"2. And lest it should seem that necessary Continence was to be hoped for from the Lord only in respect of the lust of the lower parts of the flesh, it is also sung in the Psalm; \"Set, O Lord, a watch to my mouth, and a door of Continence around my lips.\"[fn-35-P3579_1689562:4-nf] But in this witness of the divine speech, if we understand \"mouth\" as we ought to understand it, we perceive how great a gift of God Continence there set is. Forsooth it is little to contain the mouth of the body, lest any thing burst forth thence, which is not for the better, through the sound of the voice. For there is, within, the mouth of the heart, where he, who spake these words, and wrote them for us to speak, desired of the Lord that the watch and door of Continence should be set for him. For many things we say not with the mouth of the body, and cry aloud with the heart: but there goes forth from the mouth of the body no word of any thing, whereof there is silence in the heart. Therefore what flows not forth thence, sounds not abroad: but what flows forth thence, if it be evil, although it move not the tongue, defiles the soul. Therefore Continence must be set there, where the conscience even of them who are silent speaks. For it is brought to pass by means of the door of Continence, that there go not forth thence that, which, even when the lips of the flesh are closed, pollutes the life of him that hath the thought.","index":"7","references":[{"fn":"35","code":"P3579_1689562","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Ps. cxli. 3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":141,"verses":[3]}]}]},{"text":"3. Lastly, to show more plainly the inner mouth, which by these words he meant, after having said, \"Set a watch, O Lord, to my mouth, and a door of Continence around my lips,\" he added straightway, \"Cause not my heart to fall aside into evil words.\"[fn-35-P3581_1690972:5-nf] The failing aside of the heart, what is it but the consent? For he hath not yet spoken, whosoever in his heart hath with no failing aside of the heart consented unto suggestions that meet him of each several thing that is seen. But, if he hath consented, he hath already spoken in his heart, although he hath not uttered sound by the mouth; although he hath not done with hand or any part whatever of the body, yet hath he done what in his thought he hath already determined that he is to do: guilty by the divine laws, although hidden to human senses; the word having been spoken in the heart, no deed having been committed through the body. But in no case would he have moved the limb without, in a deed, the beginning of which deed had not gone before within in word. For it is no lie that is written, that \"the beginning of every work is a word.\"[fn-35-P3582_1691851:6-nf] Forsooth men do many things with mouth closed, tongue quiet, voice bridled; but yet they do nothing by work of the body, which they have not before spoken in the heart. And through this since there are many sins in inward sayings which are not in outward deeds, whereas there are none in outward deeds, which do not go before in inward sayings, there will be purity of innocence from both, if the door of Continence be set around the inward lips.","index":"8","references":[{"fn":"35","code":"P3581_1690972","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"See R.V.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"35","code":"P3582_1691851","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Ecclus. xxxvii. 16.

For which cause our Lord Himself also with His own mouth saith, \"Cleanse what are within, and what are without will be clean.\"[fn-35-P3584_1692456:7-nf] And, also, in another place, when He was refuting the foolish speeches of the Jews, in that they spake evil against His disciples, eating with unwashen hands; \"Not what entereth into the mouth,\" said He, \"defileth the man: but what cometh forth out of the mouth, that defileth the man.\"[fn-35-P3585_1692763:8-nf] Which sentence, if the whole of it be taken of the mouth of the body, is absurd. For neither doth vomit defile him, whom food defileth not. Forsooth food entereth into the mouth, vomit proceedeth forth out of the mouth. But without doubt the former words relate to the mouth of the flesh, where He says, \"Not what entereth into the mouth defileth the man,\" but the latter words to the mouth of the heart, where He saith, \"But what proceedeth forth out of the mouth, this defileth the man.\"[fn-35-P3586_1693270:9-nf] Lastly, when the Apostle Peter sought of Him an explanation of this as of a parable, He answered, \"Are ye also yet without understanding? understand ye not, that whatsoever entereth into the mouth, goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?\" Here surely we perceive the mouth of the flesh, into which the food enters. But in what He next adds, in order that we might recognize the mouth of the heart, the slowness of our heart would not follow, did not the Truth deign to walk even with the slow. For He saith, \"But what things go forth from the mouth, go out of the heart;\" as though He should say, When you hear it said \"from the mouth,\" understand \"from the heart.\" I say both, but I set forth one by the other. The inner man hath an inner mouth, and this the inner ear discerns: what things go forth from this mouth, go out of the heart, and they defile the man. Then having left the term mouth, which may be understood also of the body, He shows more openly what He is saying. \"For from the heart go out,\" saith He, \"evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies; these are what defile the man.\" There is surely no one of those evils, which can be committed also by the members of the body, but that the evil thoughts go before and defile the man, although something hinder the sinful and wicked deeds of the body from following. For if, because power is not given, the hand is free from the murder of a man, is the heart of the murderer forsooth therefore clean from sin? Or if she be chaste, whom one unchaste wishes to commit adultery with, hath he on that account failed to commit adultery with her in his heart? Or if the harlot be not found in the brothel, doth he, who seeks her, on that account fail to commit fornication in his heart? Or if time and place be wanting to one who wishes to hurt his neighbor by a lie, hath he on that account failed already to speak false witness with his tuner mouth? Or if any one fearing men, dare not utter aloud blasphemy with tongue of flesh, is he on this account guiltless of this crime, who saith in his heart, \"There is no Coot.\"[fn-35-P3587_1695428:10-nf] Thus all the other evil deeds of men, which no motion of the body performs, of which no sense of the body is conscious, have their own secret criminals, who are also polluted by consent alone in thought, that is, by evil words of the inner mouth. Into which he (the Psalmist) fearing lest his heart should fall aside, asks of the Lord that the door of Continence be set around the lips of this mouth, to contain the heart, that it fall not aside into evil words: but contain it, by not suffering thought to proceed to consent: for thus, according to the precept of the Apostle, sin reigneth not in our mortal body, nor do we yield our members as weapons of unrighteousness unto sin.[fn-35-P3588_1696129:11-nf] From fulfilling which precept they are surely far removed, who on this account turn not their members to sin, because no power is allowed them; and if this be present, straightway by the motions of their members, as of weapons, they show, who reigneth in them within. Wherefore so far as is in themselves, they yield their members weapons of unrighteousness unto sin; because this is what they wish, which for this reason they yield not, because they are not able.","index":"9","references":[{"fn":"35","code":"P3584_1692456","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Matt. xxiii. 26.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":23,"verses":[26]}]},{"fn":"35","code":"P3585_1692763","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Matt. xv. 11.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":15,"verses":[11]}]},{"fn":"35","code":"P3586_1693270","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Matt. xv. 17-20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":15,"verses":[17]}]},{"fn":"35","code":"P3587_1695428","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Ps. xiv. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":14,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"35","code":"P3588_1696129","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Rom. vi. 12, 13.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":6,"verses":[12]}]}]},{"text":"5. And on this account that, which, the parts that beget being bridled by modesty, is most chiefly and properly to be called Continence, is violated by no transgression, if the higher Continence, concerning which we have been some time speaking, be preserved in the heart. For this reason the Lord, after He had said, \"For from the heart go forth evil thoughts,\" then went on to add what it is that belongs to evil thoughts, \"murders, adulteries,\" and the rest. He spake not of all; but, having named certain by way of instance, He taught that we are to understand others also. Of which there is no one that can take place, unless an evil thought have gone before, whereby that is prepared within which is done without, and going forth out of the mouth of the heart already defiles the man, although, through no power being granted, it be not done without by means of the members of the body. When therefore a door of Continence hath been set in the mouth of the heart, whence go out all that defile the man, if nothing such be permitted to go out thence, there followeth a purity, wherein now the conscience may rejoice; although there be not as yet that perfection, wherein Continence shall not strive with vice. But now, so long as \"the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh,\"[fn-35-P3590_1697925:12-nf] it is enough for us not to consent unto the evils which we feel in us. But, when that consent takes place, then there goeth out of the mouth of the heart what defileth the man.

For Continence also itself, when it curbs and restrains lusts, at once both seeks the good unto the immortality of which we aim, and rejects the evil with which in this mortality we contend. Of the one it is forsooth the lover and beholder, but of the other both the enemy and witness: both seeking what becomes, and fleeing what misbecomes. Assuredly Continence would not labor in curbing lusts, if we had no wishes contrary to what is becoming, if there were no opposition on the part of evil lust unto our good will. The Apostle cries aloud, \"I know,\" saith he, \"that there dwelleth not in me, that is in my flesh, good. For to will lieth near to me, but to accomplish good I find not.\"[fn-35-P3594_1699214:15-nf] For now good can be done, so far as that there be no assent given unto evil lust: but good will be accomplished, when the evil lust itself shall come to an end.

And this the same Apostle in another place confessing more plainly saith, \"Man shall not be justified of the works of the Law.\"[fn-36-P3622_1709108:38-nf] The Corinthians also he rebukes, saying, \"Are ye not carnal, and walk after man?\"[fn-36-P3623_1709208:39-nf] After he had called them carnal, he saith not, ye walk after the flesh, but after man, forasmuch as by this also what would he have understood, but after the flesh? For surely if to walk, that is, to live, after the flesh deserved blame, but after man deserved praise, he would not say by way of rebuke, \"ye walk after man.\" Let man recognize the reproach; let him change his purpose, let him shun destruction. Hear thou man: walk not thou after man, but after Him Who made man. Fall not thou away from Him Who made thee, even unto thyself. For a man said, who yet lived not after man, \"Not that we are sufficient to think any thing from ourselves, as though of ourselves: but our sufficiency is of God.\"[fn-36-P3624_1709933:40-nf] Consider if he lived after man, who spake these things with truth. Therefore the Apostle, admonishing man not to live after man, restores man to God. But whoso liveth not after man, but after God, assuredly liveth not even after himself, because himself also is a man. But he is therefore said also to live after the flesh, when he so lives; because also when the flesh alone hath been named, man is understood, as we have already shown: just as when the soul alone hath been named, man is understood: whence it is said, \"Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers,\"[fn-36-P3625_1710526:41-nf] that is, every man; and, \"Seventy-five souls went down into Egypt with Jacob,\"[fn-36-P3626_1710624:42-nf] that is, seventy-five men. Therefore live thou not after thyself, O man: thou hadst thence perished, but thou wast sought. Live not then, I say, after thyself, O man; thou hadst thence perished, but thou wast found. Accuse not thou the nature of the flesh, when you hear it said, \"If ye shall live after the flesh, ye shall die.\"[fn-36-P3627_1710974:43-nf] For thus could it be said, and most truly could it, If ye shall live after yourselves ye shall die.

The one forsooth he shows, where he says, \"To will is present with me, but to perfect good is not;\"[fn-36-P3662_1728627:69-nf] the other, where he says, \"Walk in the Spirit, and perfect not the lusts of the flesh.\"[fn-36-P3663_1728734:70-nf] For neither in the former place doth he say that to do good is not with him, but \"to perfect,\" nor here doth he say, Have not \"lusts of the flesh,\" but \"perfect not.\" Therefore there take place in us evil lusts, when that pleases which is not lawful; but they are not perfected, when evil lusts are restrained by the mind serving the Law of God. And good takes place, when that, which wrongly pleases, takes not place through the good delight prevailing. But the perfection of good is not fulfilled, so long as by the flesh serving the law of sin, evil lust entices, and, although it be restrained, is yet moved. For there would be no need for it to be restrained, were it not moved. There will be at some time also the perfection of good, when the destruction of evil: the one will be highest, the other will be no more. And if we think that this is to be hoped for in this mortal state, we are deceived. For it shall be then, when death shall not be; and it shall be there, where shall be life eternal. For in that world,[fn-36-P3664_1729775:71-nf] and in that kingdom, there shall be highest good, no evil: when there shall be, and where there shall be, highest love of wisdom, no labor of continence. Therefore the flesh is not evil, if it be void of evil, that is, of fault, whereby man was rendered faulty, not made ill, but himself making. For on either part, that is, both soul and body, being made good by the good God, himself made the evil, whereby he was made evil. From the guilt of which evil being already also set free through forgiveness,[fn-36-P3665_1730295:72-nf] that he may not think what he hath done to be light, he yet wars with his own fault through continence. But far be it that there be any faults in such as reign in that peace which shall be hereafter; since in this state of war there are lessened daily in such as make progress, not sins only, but the very lusts also, with which, by not consenting, we strive, and by consenting unto which we sin.","index":"25","references":[{"fn":"36","code":"P3662_1728627","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Rom. vii. 18.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":7,"verses":[18]}]},{"fn":"36","code":"P3663_1728734","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Gal. v. 16.","bible_refs":[{"book":"galatians","chapter":5,"verses":[16]}]},{"fn":"36","code":"P3664_1729775","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Saeculo..","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"36","code":"P3665_1730295","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Indulgentiam..","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"21. That, therefore, the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, that there dwelleth not in our flesh good, that the law in our members is opposed to the law of the mind, is not a mingling of two natures caused of contrary principles, but a division of one against itself caused through desert of sin. We were not so in Adam, before that nature, having listened to and followed its deceiver, had despised and offended its Creator: that is, not the former life of man created, but the latter punishment of man condemned. From which condemnation when set free by Grace, through Jesus Christ, being free they contend with their punishment, having received not as yet full salvation, but already a pledge of salvation: but when not set free, they are both guilty by reason of sins, and involved in punishments. But after this life for the guilty there will remain for ever punishment for their crime: for the free there will no more remain for ever either crime or punishment: but the good substances, spirit and flesh, will continue for ever, which God, Who is good, and incapable of change, created good although capable of change. But they will continue having been changed for the better, never from this time to be changed for the worse: all evil being utterly destroyed, both what man hath unjustly done, and what he hath justly suffered. And, these two kinds of evil perishing utterly, whereof the one is of iniquity going before, the other of unhappiness following after, the will of man will be upright without any depravity. There it will be clear and plain to all, what now many of the faithful believe, few understand, that evil is not a substance: but that, as a wound in a body, so in a substance, which hath made itself faulty, it hath begun to exist, when the disease hath commenced, and ceaseth to exist in it, when the healing hath been perfected.

For he not only saith, \"Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the Church,\" which is from an higher: but he said also, \"Husbands ought to love their own wives, as their own bodies,\" which is from a lower: because both higher and lower are all good. And yet the woman received not pattern from the body, or flesh, to be so subject to the husband as the flesh to the spirit; but either the Apostle would have understood by consequence, what he omitted to state: or haply because the flesh lusteth against the spirit in the mortal and sick estate of this life, therefore he would not set the woman a pattern of subjection from it. But the men he would for this reason, because, although the spirit lusteth against the flesh, even in this it consults for the good of the flesh: not like as the flesh lusting against the spirit, by such opposition consulteth neither for the good of the spirit, nor for its own.

Thus much will suffice to have treated on behalf of true Continence against the Manichees deceitfully continent, lest the fruitful and glorious labor of Continence, when it restrains and curbs the lowest part of us, that is, the body, from immoderate and unlawful pleasures, be believed not healthfully to chasten, but hostilely to persecute. Forsooth the body is indeed different from the nature of the soul, yet is it not alien from the nature of man: for the soul is not made up of body, but yet man is made up of soul and body: and assuredly, whom God frees, He frees the whole man. Whence our Saviour Himself also took upon Him the whole man, having deigned to free in us all that He made. They who hold contrary to this truth, what doth it profit them to restrain lusts?if, that is, they restrain any. What in them can be made clean through Continence, whose such Continence is unclean? and which ought not to be called Continence. Forsooth to hold what they hold is the poison of the devil; but Continence is the gift of God. But as not every one who suffers any thing, or with the greatest endurance suffers any pain whatever, possesses that virtue, which in like manner is the gift of God, and is called Patience; for many endure many torments, in order not to betray either such as are wickedly privy with them in their crimes, or themselves; many in order to satiate glowing lusts, and to obtain, or not to abandon those things, whereunto they are bound by chain of evil love; many on behalf of different and destructive errors, whereby they are strongly held: of all of whom far be it from us to say that they have true patience: thus not every one, who contains in any thing, or who marvellously retrains even the very lusts of the flesh, or mind, is to be said to possess that continence, of the profit and beauty of which we are treating.

Certain through injustice, as if spouse yield not to spouse the due of sexual intercourse, because he or she is already able to overcome such appetite of the body.

Forsooth marriage continence is wont to ease this lust of the flesh, and to check its curb but thus far, that neither in marriage itself it run riot by immoderate license, but that a measure be observed, either such as is due to the weakness of the spouse, unto whom the Apostle enjoins not this, as of command, but yields it as of permission;[fn-37-P3705_1750139:105-nf] or such as is suited for the begetting of sons, which was formerly the one alone occasion of sexual intercourse to both holy fathers and mothers. But continence doing this, that is, moderating, and in a certain way limiting in married persons the lust of the flesh, and ordering in a certain way within fixed limits its unquiet and inordinate motion, uses well the evil of man, whom it makes and wills to make perfect good: as God uses even evil men, for their sake whom He perfects in goodness.","index":"32","references":[{"fn":"37","code":"P3705_1750139","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"1 Cor. vii. 6","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":7,"verses":[6]}]}]},{"text":"28. Far be it therefore that we say of continence, of which Scripture saith. \"And this very thing was wisdom, to know whose gift it was,\"[fn-37-P3707_1750793:106-nf] that even they possess it, who, by containing, either serve errors, or overcome any lesser desires for this purpose, that they may fulfill others, by the greatness of which they are overcome. But that continence which is true, coming from above, wills not to repress some evils by other evils, but to heal all evils by goods. And, briefly to comprehend its mode of action, it is the place of continence to keep watch to restrain and heal all delights whatsoever of lust, which are opposed to the delight of wisdom. Whence without doubtthey set it within too narrow bounds, who limit it to restraining the lusts of the body alone: certainly they speak better, who say that it pertains to Continence to rule in general lust or desire. Which desire is set down as a fault, nor is it only of the body, but also of the soul. For, if the desire of the body be in fornications and drunkennesses; hard enmities, strifes, emulations, lastly, hatreds, their exercise in the pleasure of the body, and not rather in the motion and troubled states of the soul? Yet the Apostle called all these \"works of the flesh,\" whether what pertained to the soul, or what pertained properly to the flesh, calling forsooth the man himself by the name of the flesh.[fn-37-P3708_1752055:107-nf] Forsooth they are the works of man, whatsoever are not called works of God; forasmuch as man, who does these, lives after himself, not after God, so far as he does these. But there are other works of man, which are rather to be called works of God. \"For it is God,\"[fn-37-P3709_1752348:108-nf] saith the Apostle, \"Who worketh in you both to will and to do, according to His good pleasure.\" Whence also is that, \"For as many as are led by the spirit of God, these are sons of God.\"[fn-37-P3710_1752557:109-nf] ","index":"33","references":[{"fn":"37","code":"P3707_1750793","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Wisd. viii. 21.","bible_refs":[{"book":"wisdom","chapter":8,"verses":[21]}]},{"fn":"37","code":"P3708_1752055","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Gal. v. 19, 20, 21.","bible_refs":[{"book":"galatians","chapter":5,"verses":[19]}]},{"fn":"37","code":"P3709_1752348","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Phil. ii. 13.","bible_refs":[{"book":"philippians","chapter":2,"verses":[13]}]},{"fn":"37","code":"P3710_1752557","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Rom. viii. 14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":8,"verses":[14]}]}]},{"text":"29.

For what more plain than this? what more clear? He is certainly speaking unto those, who had risen again with Christ, not yet surely in the flesh, but in the mind: whom he calls dead, and on this account the more living: for \"your life,\" saith he, \"is hid with Christ in God.\" Of such dead the speech is: \"But I live, now not I, but there liveth in me Christ.\" They therefore, whose life was hidden in God, are admonished and exhorted to mortify their members, which are upon the earth. For this follows, \"Mortify, therefore, your members, which are upon the earth.\" And, lest any through excess of dullness should think that such are to mortify the members of the body that are seen, straightway opening what it is he saith, \"Fornication,\" saith he, \"uncleanness, passion, evil lust, and covetousness, which is idolatry.\"[fn-37-P3716_1754662:114-nf] But is it so to be believed, that they, who were already dead, and their life hidden with Christ in God, were still committing fornication, were still living in unclean habits and works, were still slaves to passions of evil lust and covetousness?

And how are they mortified by the work of continence, save when we consent not to them with the mind, nor are the members of the body yielded to them as weapons; and, what is greater, and to be looked to with yet greater watchfulness of continence, our very thought itself, although in a certain way it be touched by their suggestion, and as it were, whisper, yet turns away from these, that it receive not delight from them, and turns to more delightful thoughts of things above: on this account naming them in discourse, that men abide not in them, but flee from them.

Do ye also, saith he, put down those evils, on account of which cometh the wrath of God on the children of unbelief; nor promise yourselves impunity of them on account of merit of faith.

For, so long as the Spirit lusteth against the flesh, this business proceeds with great earnestness, resistance is offered unto evil delights, unclean lusts, carnal and shameful motions, by the sweetness of holiness, by the love of chastity, by spiritual vigor, and by the beauty of continence; thus they are laid down by them who are dead to them, and who live not in them by consenting. Thus, I say, they are put down, whilst they are weighed down by continued continence, that they rise not again. Whosoever, as though secure, shall, cease from this laying aside of them, straightway they will assault the Citadel of the mind, and will themselves put it down thence, and will reduce it into slavery to them, captive after a base and unseemly fashion.
