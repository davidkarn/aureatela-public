But there are two things most hard to bear with, in the case of those who are in error: hasty assumption before the truth is made plain; and, when it has been made-plain, defence of the falsehood thus hastily assumed. From which two faults, inimical as they are to the finding out of the truth, and to the handling of the divine and sacred books, should God, as I pray and hope, defend and protect me with the shield of His good will,[fn-4-P437_154455:1-nf] and with the grace of His mercy, I will not be slow to search out the substance of God, whether through His Scripture orthrough the creature. For both of these are set forth for our contemplation to this end,that He may Himself be sought, and Himself be loved, who inspired the one, and created the other. Nor shall I be afraid of giving my opinion, in which I shall more desire to be examined by the upright, than fear to be carped at by the perverse. For charity, most excellent and unassuming, gratefully accepts the dovelike eye; but for the dog's tooth nothing remains, save either to shun it by the most cautious humility, or to blunt it by the most solid truth; and far rather would I be censured by any one whatsoever, than be praised by either the erring or the flatterer. For the lover of truth need fear no one's censure. For he that censures, must needs be either enemy or friend. And if an enemy reviles, he must be borne with: but a friend, if he errs, must be taught; if he teaches, listened to. But if one who errs praises you, he confirms your error; if one who flatters, he seduces you into error. \"Let the righteous,\" therefore, \"smite me, it shall be a kindness; and let him reprove me; but the oil of the sinner shall not anoint my head.\"[fn-4-P438_155729:2-nf] ","index":"23","references":[{"fn":"4","code":"P437_154455","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Ps. v. 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":5,"verses":[12]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P438_155729","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Ps. cxli. 5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":141,"verses":[5]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 1.-There is a Double Rule for Understanding the Scriptural Modes of Speech Concerning the Son of God.

Wherefore, although we hold most firmly, concerning our Lord Jesus Christ, what may be called the canonical rule, as it is both disseminated through the Scriptures, and has been demonstrated by learned and Catholic handlers of the same Scriptures, namely, that the Son of God is both understood to be equal to the Father according to the form of God in which He is, and less than the Father according to the form of a servant which He took;[fn-4-P442_156346:3-nf] in which form He was found to be not only less than the Father, but also less than the Holy Spirit; and not only so, but less even than Himself,-not than Himself who was, but than Himself who is; because, by taking the form of a servant, He did not lose the form of God, as the testimonies of the Scriptures taught us, to which we have referred in the former book: yet there are some things in the sacred text so put as to leave it ambiguous to which rule they are rather to be referred; whether to that by which we understand the Son as less, in that He has taken upon Him the creature, or to that by which we understand that the Son is not indeed less than, but equal to the Father, but yet that He is from Him, God of God, Light of light. For we call the Son God of God; but the Father, God only; not of God. Whence it is plain that the Son has another of whom He is, and to whom He is Son; but that the Father has not a Son of whom He is, but only to whom He is father. For every son is what he is, of his father, and is son to his father; but no father is what he is, of his son, but is father to his son.[fn-4-P443_157476:4-nf] ","index":"25","references":[{"fn":"4","code":"P442_156346","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Phil. ii. 6. 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"philippians","chapter":2,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P443_157476","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Augustin here brings to view both the trinitarian and the theanthropic or mediatorial subordination.

And a Divine Son and a Divine father are alike and equally divine. The theanthropic or mediatorial subordination is the status of humiliation, by reason of the incarnation.

Some things, then, are so put in the Scriptures concerning the Father and the Son, as to intimate the unity and equality of their substance; as, for instance, \"I and the Father are one;\"[fn-4-P445_158446:5-nf] and, \"Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God;\"[fn-4-P446_158544:6-nf] and whatever ether texts there are of the kind. And some, again, are so put that they show the Son as less on account of the form of a servant, that is, of His having taken upon Him the creature of a changeable and human substance; as, for instance, that which says, \"For my Father is greater than I;\"[fn-4-P447_158862:7-nf] and, \"The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son.\" For a little after he goes on to say, \"And hath given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of man.\" And further, some are so put, as to show Him at that time neither as lessnor as equal, but only to intimate that He isof the Father; as, for instance, that whichsays, \"For as the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself;\" and that other: \"The Soncan do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do.\"[fn-4-P448_159431:8-nf] For if we shall take this to be therefore so said, because the Son is less in the form taken from the creature, it will follow that the Father must have walked on the water, or opened the eyes with clay and spittle of some other one born blind, and have done the other things which the Son appearing in the flesh did among men, before the Son did them;[fn-4-P449_159811:9-nf] in order that He might be able to do those things, who said that the Son was not able to do anything of Himself, except what He hath seen the Father do. Yet who, even though he were mad, would think this? It remains, therefore, that these texts are so expressed, because the life of the Son is unchangeable as that of the Father is, and yet He is of the Father; and the working of the Father and of the Son is indivisible, and yet so to work is given to the Son from Him of whom He Himself is, that is, from the Father; and the Son so sees theFather, as that He is the Son in the very seeing Him. For to be of the Father, that is, to be born of the Father. is to Him nothing else than to see the Father; and to see Him working, is nothing else than to work with Him: but therefore not from Himself, because Heis not from Himself. And, therefore, those things which \"He sees the Father do, these also doeth the Son likewise,\" because He is of the Father. For He neither does other things in like manner, as a painter paints other pictures, in the same way as he sees others to have been painted by another man; nor the same things in a different manner, as the body expresses the same letters, which the mind has thought; but \"whatsoever things,\" saith He, \"the Father doeth, these same things also doeth the Son likewise.\"[fn-4-P450_161172:10-nf] He has said both these same things,\" and \"likewise;\" and hence the working of both the Father and the Son is indivisible and equal, but it is from the Father to the Son. Therefore the Son cannot do anything of Himself, except what He seeth the Father do. From this rule, then, whereby the Scriptures so speak as to mean, not to set forth one as less than another, but only to show which is of which, some have drawn this meaning, as if the Son were said to be less. And some among ourselves who are more unlearned and least instructed in these things, endeavoring to take these texts according to the form of a servant, and so mis-interpreting them, are troubled. And to prevent this, the rule in question is to be observed whereby the Son is not less, but it is simply intimated that He is of the Father, in which words not His inequality but His birth is declared.","index":"26","references":[{"fn":"4","code":"P445_158446","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"John x. 30.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":10,"verses":[30]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P446_158544","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Phil. ii. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"philippians","chapter":2,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P447_158862","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"John xiv. 28.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":14,"verses":[28]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P448_159431","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"John v. 22, 27, 26, 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":5,"verses":[22]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P449_159811","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Matt. xiv. 26, and John ix. 6, 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":14,"verses":[26]},{"book":"john","chapter":9,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P450_161172","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"John v. 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":5,"verses":[19]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 2.-That Some Ways of Speaking Concerning the Son are to Be Understood According to Either Rule.","index":4,"paragraphs":[{"text":"4.

For this reason, then, if both the Son and the Holy Spirit are sent thither where they were, we must inquire, how that sending, whether of the Son or of the Holy Spirit, is to be understood; for of the Father alone, we nowhere read that He is sent. Now, of the Son, the apostle writes thus: \"But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law.\"[fn-4-P476_170738:23-nf] \"He sent,\" he says, \"His Son, made of a woman.\" And by this term, woman,[fn-4-P477_170831:24-nf] what Catholic does not know that he did not wish to signify the privation of virginity; but, according to a Hebraism, the difference of sex? When, therefore, he says, \"God sent His Son, made of a woman,\" he sufficiently shows that the Son was \"sent\" in this very way, in that He was \"made of a woman.\"Therefore, in that He was born of God, He was in the world; but in that He was born of Mary, He was sent and came into the world. Moreover, He could not be sent by the Father without the Holy Spirit, not only because the Father, when He sent Him, that is, when He made Him of a woman, is certainly understood not to have so made Him without His own Spirit; but also because it is most plainly and expressly said in the Gospel in answer to the Virgin Mary, when she asked of the angel, \"How shall this be?\" \"The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee.\"[fn-4-P478_171744:25-nf] And Matthew says, \"She was found with child of the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-4-P479_171829:26-nf] Although, too, in the prophet Isaiah, Christ Himself is understood to say of His own future advent, \"And now the Lord God and His Spirit hath sent me.\"[fn-4-P480_171999:27-nf] ","index":"35","references":[{"fn":"4","code":"P476_170738","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Gal. iv. 4, 5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"galatians","chapter":4,"verses":[4]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P477_170831","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Mulier..","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"4","code":"P478_171744","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Luke i. 34, 35.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":1,"verses":[34]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P479_171829","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Matt. i. 18.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":1,"verses":[18]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P480_171999","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Isa. xlviii. 16.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":48,"verses":[16]}]}]},{"text":"9. Perhaps some one may wish to drive us to say, that the Son is sent also by Himself, because the conception and childbirth of Mary is the working of the Trinity, by whose act of creating all things are created. And how, he will go on to say, has the Father sent Him, if He sent Himself? To whom I answer first, by asking him to tell me, if he can, in what manner the Father hath sanctified Him, if He hath sanctified Himself? For the same Lord says both; \"Say ye of Him,\" He says, \"whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God;\"[fn-4-P482_172618:28-nf] while in another place He says, \"And for their sake I sanctify myself.\"[fn-4-P483_172707:29-nf] I ask, also, in what manner the Father delivered Him, if He delivered Himself? For the Apostle Paul says both: \"Who,\" he says, \"spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all;\"[fn-4-P484_172913:30-nf] while elsewhere he says of the Saviour Himself, \"Who loved me, and delivered Himself for me.\"[fn-4-P485_173027:31-nf] He will reply, I suppose, if he has a right sense in these things, Because the will of the Father and the Son is one, and their working indivisible. In like manner, then, let him understand the incarnation and nativity of the Virgin, wherein the Son is understood as sent, to have been wrought by one and the same operation of the Father and of the Son indivisibly; the Holy Spirit certainly not being thence excluded, of whom it is expressly said, \"She was found with child by the Holy Ghost.\" For perhaps our meaning will be more plainly unfolded, if we ask in what manner God sent His Son. He commanded that He should come, and He, complying with the commandment, came. Did He then request, or did He only suggest? But whichever of these it was, certainly it was done by a word, and the Word of God is the Son of God Himself. Wherefore, since the Father sent Him by a word, His being sent was the work of both the Father and His Word; therefore the same Son was sent by the Father and the Son, because the Son Himself is the Word of the Father. For who would embrace so impious an opinion as to think the Father to have uttered a word in time, in order thatthe eternal Son might thereby be sent and might appear in the flesh in the fullness oftime? But assuredly it was in that Word of God itself which was in the beginning with God and was God, namely, in the wisdom itself of God, apart from time, at what time that wisdom must needs appear in the flesh. Therefore, since without any commencement of time, the Word was in the beginning, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, it was in the Word itself without any time, at what time the Word was to be made flesh and dwell among us.[fn-4-P486_174743:32-nf] And when this fullness of time had come, \"God sent His Son, made of a woman,\"[fn-4-P487_174844:33-nf] that is, made in time, that the Incarnate Word might appear to men; while it was in that Word Himself, apart from time, at what time this was to be done; for the order of times is in the eternal wisdom of God without time. Since, then, that the Son should appear in the flesh was wrought by both the Father and the Son, it is fitly said that He who appeared in that flesh was sent, and that He who did not appear in it, sent Him; because those things which are transacted outwardly before the bodily eyes have their existence from the inward structure (apparatu) of the spiritual nature, and on that account are filly said to be sent. Further, that form of man which He took is the person of the Son, not also of the Father; on which account the invisible Father, together with the Son, who with the Father is invisible, is said to have sent the same Son by making Him visible. But if He became visible in such way as to cease to be invisible with the Father, that is, if the substance of the invisible Word were turned by a change and transition into a visible creature, then the Son would be so understood to be sent by the Father, that He would be found to be only sent; not also, with the Father, sending. But since He so took the form of a servant, as that the unchangeable form of God remained, it is clear that that which became apparent in the Son was done by the Father and the Son not being apparent; that is, that by the invisible Father, with the invisible Son, the same Son Himself was sent so as to be visible. Why, therefore, does He say, \"Neither came I of myself?\" This, we may now say, is said according to the form of a servant, in the same way as it is said, \"I judge no man.\"[fn-4-P488_176558:34-nf] ","index":"36","references":[{"fn":"4","code":"P482_172618","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"John x. 36.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":10,"verses":[36]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P483_172707","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"John xvii. 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":17,"verses":[19]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P484_172913","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Rom. viii. 32.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":8,"verses":[32]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P485_173027","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Gal. ii. 20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"galatians","chapter":2,"verses":[20]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P486_174743","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"John i. 1, 2, 14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":1,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P487_174844","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Gal. iv. 4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"galatians","chapter":4,"verses":[4]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P488_176558","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"10 John viii. 42, 15.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":8,"verses":[42]}]}]},{"text":"10.

It is, then, for this reason nowhere written, that the Father is greater than the Holy Spirit, or that the Holy Spirit is less than God the Father, because the creature in which the Holy Spirit was to appear was not taken in the same way as the Son of man was taken, as the form in which the person of the Word of God Himself should be set forth not that He might possess the word of God, as other holy and wise men have possessed it, but \"above His fellows;\"[fn-4-P495_178258:37-nf] not certainly that He possessed the word more than they, so as to be of more surpassing wisdom than the rest were, but that He was the very Word Himself. For the word in the flesh is one thing, and the Word made flesh is another; i.e. the word in man is one thing, the Word that is man is another. For flesh is put for man, where it is said, \"The Word was made flesh;\"[fn-4-P496_178643:38-nf] and again, \"And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.\"[fn-4-P497_178719:39-nf] For it does not mean flesh without soul and without mind; but \"all flesh,\" is the same as if it were said, every man. The creature, then, in which the Holy Spirit should appear, was not so taken, as that flesh and human form were taken, of the Virgin Mary. For the Spirit did not beatify the dove, or the wind, or the fire, and join them for ever to Himself and to His person in unity and \"fashion.\"[fn-4-P498_179137:40-nf] Nor, again, is the nature of the Holy Spirit mutable and changeable; so that these things were not made of the creature, but He himself was turned and changed first into one and then into another, as water is changed into ice. But these things appeared at the seasons at which they ought to have appeared, the creature serving the Creator, and being changed and converted at the command of Him who remains immutably in Himself, in order to signify and manifest Him in such way as it was fit He should be signified and manifested to mortal men. Accordingly, although that dove is called the Spirit;[fn-4-P499_180250:41-nf] and in speaking of that fire, \"There appeared unto them,\" he says, \"cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them; and they began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance;[fn-5-P500_180480:42-nf] in order to show that the Spirit was manifested by that fire, as by the dove; yet we cannot call the Holy Spirit both God and a dove, or both God and fire, in the same way as we call the Son both God and man; nor as we call the Son the Lamb of God; which not only John the Baptist says, \"Behold the Lamb of God,\"[fn-5-P501_180813:43-nf] but also John the Evangelist sees the Lamb slain in the Apocalypse.[fn-5-P502_180899:44-nf] For that prophetic vision was not shown to bodily eyes through bodily forms, but in the spirit through spiritual images of bodily things. But whosoever saw that dove and that fire, saw them with their eyes. Although it may perhaps be disputed concerning the fire, whether it was seen by the eyes or in the spirit, on account of the form of the sentence. For the text does not say, They saw cloven tongues like fire, but, \"There appeared to them.\" But we are not wont to say with the same meaning, It appeared to me; as we say, I saw. And in those spiritual visions of corporeal images the usual expressions are, both, It appeared to me; and, I saw: but in those things which are shown to the eyes through express corporeal forms, the common expression is not, It appeared to me; but, I saw. There may, therefore, be a question raised respecting that fire, how it was seen; whether within in the spirit as it were outwardly, or really outwardly before the eyes of the flesh. But of that dove, which is said to have descended in a bodily form, no one ever doubted that it was seen by the eyes. Nor, again, as we call the Son a Rock (for it is written, \"And that Rock was Christ\"[fn-5-P503_182093:45-nf] ), can we so call the Spirits dove or fire. For that rock was a thing already created, and after the mode of its action was called by the name of Christ, whom it signified; like the stone placed under Jacob's head, and also anointed, which he took in order to signify the Lord;[fn-5-P504_182390:46-nf] or as Isaac was Christ, when he carried the wood for the sacrifice of himself.[fn-5-P505_182492:47-nf] A particular significative action was added to those already existing things; they did not, as that dove and fire, suddenly come into being in order simply so to signify. The dove and the fire, indeed, seem to me more like that flame which appeared to Moses in the bush,[fn-5-P506_182782:48-nf] or that pillar which the people followed in the wilderness,[fn-5-P507_182860:49-nf] or the thunders and lightnings which came when the Law was given in the mount.[fn-5-P508_182962:50-nf] For the corporeal form of these things came into being for the very purpose, that it might signify something, and then pass away.[fn-5-P509_183110:51-nf] ","index":"39","references":[{"fn":"4","code":"P495_178258","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Heb. i. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"hebrews","chapter":1,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P496_178643","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"John i. 14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":1,"verses":[14]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P497_178719","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Luke iii. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":3,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"4","code":"P498_179137","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"The reference is to sxhma, in Phil. ii. 8-the term chosen by St. Paul to describe the \"likeness of men,\" which the second trinitarian person assumed.

And if you say to them, In whatever manner, then, the Son is visible in Himself, in that manner also He is mortal in Himself; so that it plainly follows that you would have this saying also understood only of the Father, viz., \"Who only hath immortality;\" for if the Son is mortal from having taken upon Him our flesh, then allow that it is on account of this flesh that He is also visible: they reply, that it is not on account of this flesh that they say that the Son is mortal; but that, just as He was also before visible, so He was also before mortal. For if they say the Son is mortal from having taken our flesh, then it is not the Father alone without the Son who hath immortality; because His Word also has immortality, by which all things were made. For He did not therefore lose His immortality, because He took mortal flesh; seeing that it could not happen even to the human soul, that it should die with the body, when the Lord Himself says, \"Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul.\"[fn-5-P526_190464:58-nf] Or, forsooth, also the Holy Spirit took flesh: concerning whom certainly they will, without doubt, be troubled to say-if the Son is mortal on account of taking our flesh-in what manner they understand that the Father only has immortality without the Son and the Holy Spirit, since, indeed, the Holy Spirit did not take our flesh; and if He has not immortality, then the Son is not mortal on account of taking our flesh; but if the Holy Spirit has immortality, then it is not said only of the Father, \"Who only hath immortality.\" And therefore they think they are able to prove that the Son in Himself was mortal also before the incarnation, because changeableness itself is not unfitly called mortality, according to which the soul also is said to die; not because it is changed and turned into body, or into some substance other than itself, but because, whatever in its own selfsame substance is now after another mode than it once was, is discovered to be mortal, in so far as it has ceased to be what it was. Because then, say they, before the Son of God was born of the Virgin Mary, He Himself appeared to our fathers, not in one and the same form only, but in many forms; first in one form, then in another; He is both visible in Himself, because His substance was visible to mortal eyes, when He had not yet taken our flesh, and mortal, inasmuch as He is changeable.

And first, in that which is written in Genesis, viz., that God spake with man whom He had formed out of the dust; if we set apart the figurative meaning, and treat it so as to place faith in the narrative even in the letter, it should appear that God then spake with man in the appearance of a man. This is not indeed expressly laid down in the book, but the general tenor of its reading sounds in this sense, especially in that which is written, that Adam heard the voice of the Lord God, walking in the garden in the cool of the evening, and hid himself among the trees of the garden; and when God said, \"Adam, where art thou?\"[fn-5-P531_194021:59-nf] replied, \"I heard Thy voice, and I was afraid because I was naked, and I hid myself from Thy face.\" For I do not see how such a walking and conversation of God can be understood literally, except He appeared as a man. For it can neither be said that a voice only of God was framed, when God is said to have walked, or that He who was walking in a place was not visible; while Adam, too, says that he hid himself from the face of God. Who then was He? Whether the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Spirit? Whether altogether indiscriminately did God the Trinity Himself speak to man in the form of man? The context, indeed, itself of the Scripture nowhere, it should seem, indicates a change from person to person; but He seems still to speak to the first man, who said, \"Let there be light,\" and, \"Let there be a firmament,\" and so on through each of those days; whom we usually take to be God the Father, making by a word whatever He willed to make. For He made all things by His word, which Word we know, by the right rule of faith, to be His only Son. If, therefore, God the Father spake to the first man, and Himself was walking in the garden in the cool of the evening, and if it was from His face that the sinner hid himself amongst the trees of thegarden, why are we not to go on to understand that it was He also who appeared to Abraham and to Moses, and to whom He would, and how He would, through the changeable and visible creature, subjected to Himself, while He Himself remains in Himself and in His own substance, in which He is unchangeable and invisible? But, possibly, it might be that the Scripture passed over in a hidden way from person to person, and while it had related that the Father said \"Let there be light,\" and the rest which it mentioned Him to have done by the Word, went on to indicate the Son as speaking to the first man; not unfolding this openly, but intimating it to be understood by those who could understand it.","index":"49","references":[{"fn":"5","code":"P531_194021","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Gen. iii. 8-10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":3,"verses":[8]}]}]},{"text":"18.

Yet I would not rashly assert, even if that scripture implies Paradise to have been a material place, that God could not have walked there in any way except in some bodily form. For it might be said, that only words were framed for the man to hear, without seeing any form. Neither, because it is written, \"Adam hid himself from the face of God,\" does it follow forthwith that he usually saw His face. For what if he himself indeed could not see, but feared to be himself seen by Him whose voice he had heard, and had felt His presence as he walked? For Cain, too, said to God, \"From Thy face I will hide myself;\"[fn-5-P534_197399:61-nf] yet we are not therefore compelled to admit that he was wont to behold the face of God with his bodily eyes in any visible form, although he had heard the voice of God questioning and speaking with him of his sin. But what manner of speech it was that God then uttered to the outward ears of men, especially in speaking to the first man, it is both difficult to discover, and we have not undertaken to say in this discourse. But if words alone and sounds were wrought, by which to bring about some sensible presence of God to those first men, I do not know why I should not there understand the person of God the Father, seeing that His person is manifested also in that voice, when Jesus appeared in glory on the mount before the three disciples;[fn-5-P535_198166:62-nf] and in that when the dove descended upon Him at His baptism;[fn-5-P536_198247:63-nf] and in that where He cried to the Father concerning His own glorification and it was answered Him, \"I have both glorified, and will glorify again.\"[fn-5-P537_198414:64-nf] Not that the voice could be wrought without the work of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (since the Trinity works indivisibly), but that such a voice was wrought as to manifest the person of the Father only; just as the Trinity wrought that human form from the Virgin Mary, yet it is the person of the Son alone; for the invisible Trinity wrought the visible person of the Son alone. Neither does anything forbid us, not only to understand those words spoken to Adam as spoken by the Trinity, but also to take them as manifesting the person of that Trinity.

But why is He previously called the Angel of the Lord, when He appeared in a flame of fire out of the bush? Was it because it was one of many angels, who by an economy [or arrangement] bare the person of his Lord? or was something of the creature assumed by Him in order to bring about a visible appearance for the business in hand, and that words might thence be audibly uttered, whereby the presence of the Lord might be shown, in such way as was fitting, to the corporeal senses of man, by means of the creature made subject? For if he was one of the angels, who could easily affirm whether it was the person of the Son which was imposed upon him to announce, or that of the Holy Spirit, or that of God the Father, or altogether of the Trinity itself, who is the one and only God, in order that he might say, \"I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?\" For we cannot say that the Son of God is the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, and that the Father is not; nor will any one dare to deny that either the Holy Spirit, or the Trinity itself, whom we believe and understand to be the one God, is the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. For he who is not God, is not the God of those fathers. Furthermore, if not only the Father is God, as all, even heretics, admit; but also the Son, which, whether they will or not, they are compelled to acknowledge, since the apostle says, \"Who is over all, God blessed for ever;\" and the Holy Spirit, since the same apostle says, \"Therefore glorify God in your body;\" when he had said above, \"Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which ye have of God?\"[fn-5-P567_212549:82-nf] and these three are one God, as catholic soundness believes: it is not sufficiently apparent which person of the Trinity that angel bare, if he was one of the rest of the angels, and whether any person, and not rather that of the Trinity itself.

And in that very coming of His, which we read of in the Acts of the Apostles, there appeared cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them:[fn-5-P591_219014:99-nf] which agrees with Exodus, where it is written, \"And Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in fire;\" and a little after, \"And the sight of the glory of the Lord,\" he says, \"was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.\"[fn-5-P592_219331:100-nf] Or if these things were therefore wrought because neither the Father nor the Son could be there presented in that mode without the Holy Spirit, by whom the Law itself must needs be written; then we know doubtless that God appeared there, not by His own substance, which remains invisible and unchangeable, but by the appearance above mentioned of the creature; but that some special person of the Trinity appeared, distinguished by a proper mark, as far as my capacity of understanding reaches, we do not see.","index":"64","references":[{"fn":"5","code":"P589_218442","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Ex. xxi. 18.","bible_refs":[{"book":"exodus","chapter":21,"verses":[18]}]},{"fn":"5","code":"P590_218529","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Luke xi. 20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":11,"verses":[20]}]},{"fn":"5","code":"P591_219014","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Acts. ii. 1-4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"the acts","chapter":2,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"5","code":"P592_219331","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Ex. xxiv. 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"exodus","chapter":24,"verses":[17]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 16.-In What Manner Moses Saw God.","index":18,"paragraphs":[{"text":"26.

And certainly, as to those who are moved by the visions of waking men to believe that not the Father, but only the Son, or the Holy Spirit, appeared to the corporeal sight of men,-to omit the great extent of the sacred pages, and their manifold interpretation, such that no one of sound reason ought to affirm that the person of the Father was nowhere shown to the eyes of waking men by any corporeal appearance;-but, as I said, to omit this, what do they say of our father Abraham, who was certainly awake and ministering, when, after Scripture had premised, \"The Lord appeared unto Abraham,\" not one, or two, but three men appeared to him; no one of whom is said to have stood prominently above the others, no one more than the others to have shone with greater glory, or to have acted more authoritatively?[fn-6-P647_238933:140-nf] ","index":"76","references":[{"fn":"6","code":"P647_238933","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Gen. xviii. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":18,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"text":"35. Wherefore, since in that our threefold division we determined to inquire,[fn-6-P649_239033:141-nf] first, whether the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Spirit; or whether sometimes the Father, sometimes the Son, sometimes the Holy Spirit; or whether, without any distinction of persons, as it is said, the one and only God, that is, the Trinity itself, appeared to the fathers through those forms of the creature: now that we have examined, so far as appeared to be sufficient what places of the Holy Scriptures we could, a modest and cautious consideration of divine mysteries leads, as far as I can judge, to no other conclusion, unless that we may not rashly affirm which person of the Trinity appeared to this or that of the fathers or the prophets in some body or likeness of body, unless when the context attaches to the narrative some probable intimations on the subject. For the nature itself, or substance, or essence, or by whatever other name that very thing, which is God, whatever it be, is to be called, cannot be seen corporeally: but we must believe that by means of the creature made subject to Him, not only the Son, or the Holy Spirit, but also the Father, may have given intimations of Himself to mortal senses by a corporeal form or likeness. And since the case stands thus, that this second book may not extend to an immoderate length, let us consider what remains in those which follow.
