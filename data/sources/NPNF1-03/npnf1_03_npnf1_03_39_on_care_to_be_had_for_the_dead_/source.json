True, but this question is thus solved, namely, that there is a certain kind\nof life by which is acquired, while one lives in this body, that it should be possible for these\nthings to be of some help to the departed; and, consequently, it is \"according to the things done by\nthe body,\" that they are aided by the things which shall, after they have left the body, be\nreligiously done on their behalf.

For these pertain not to ornament or aid which is applied from without, but to\nthe very nature of man.

If this be true, doubtless also the providing for the interment of bodies a place at the\nMemorials of Saints, is a mark of a good human affection towards the remains of one's friends: since\nif there be religion in the burying, there cannot but be religion in taking thought where the burying\nshall be. But while it is desirable there should be such like solaces of survivors, for the showing\nforth of their pious mind towards their beloved, I do not see what helps they be to the dead save in\nthis way: that upon recollection of the place in which are deposited the bodies of those whom they\nlove, they should by prayer commend them to those same Saints, who have as patrons taken them into\ntheir charge to aid them before the Lord. Which indeed they would be still able to do, even though\nthey were not able to inter them in such places. But then the only reason why the name Memorials or\nMonuments is given to those sepulchres of the dead which become, specially distinguished, is that\nthey recall to memory, and by putting in mind cause us to think of, them who by death are withdrawn\nfrom the eyes of the living, that they may not by forgetfulness be also withdrawn from men's hearts.\nFor both the term Memorial[fn-48-P4871_2389317:20-nf] most plainly\nshews this, and Monument is so named from monishing, that is, putting in mind. For which reason the\nGreeks also call that mnhmeon which we call a Memorial or Monument:\nbecause in their tongue the memory itself, by which we remember, is called mnhmh. When therefore the mind recollects where the body of a very dear friend\nlies buried, and thereupon there occurs to the thoughts a place rendered venerable by the name of a\nMartyr, to that same Martyr doth it commend the soul in affection of heartfelt recollection[fn-48-P4872_2389858:21-nf] and prayer. And when this affection is exhibited\nto the departed by faithful men who were most dear to them, there is no doubt that it profits them\nwho while living in the body merited that such things should profit them after this life. But even if\nsome necessity should through absence of all facility not allow bodies to be interred, or in such\nplaces interred, yet should there be no pretermitting of supplications for the spirits of the dead:\nwhich supplications, that they should be made for all in Christian and catholic fellowship departed,\neven without mentioning of their names, under a general commemoration, the Church hath charged\nherself withal; to the intent that they which lack, for these offices, parents or sons or whatever\nkindred or friends, may have the same afforded unto them by the one pious mother which is common to\nall.

When therefore the faithful mother of a faithful son departed desired to have his body\ndeposited in the basilica of a Martyr, forasmuch as she believed that his soul would be aided by the\nmerits of the Martyr, the very believing of this was a sort of supplication, and this profited, if\naught profited. And in that she recurs in her thoughts to this same sepulchre, and in her prayers\nmore and more commends her son, the spirit of the departed is aided, not by the place of its dead\nbody, but by that which springs from memory of the place, the living affection of the mother. For at\nonce the thought, who is commended and to whom, doth touch, and that with no unprofitable emotion,\nthe religious mind of her who prays. For also in prayer to God,[fn-48-P4874_2391703:22-nf] men do with the members of their bodies that\nwhich becometh suppliants, when they bend their knees, when they stretch forth their hands, or even\nprostrate themselves on the ground, and whatever else they visibly do, albeit their invisible will\nand heart's intention be known unto God, and He needs not these tokens that any man's mind should be\nopened unto Him: only hereby one more excites himself to pray and groan more humbly and more\nfervently. And I know not how it is, that, while these motions of the body cannot be made but by a\nmotion of the mind preceding, yet by the same being outwardly in visible sort made, that inward\ninvisible one which made them is increased: and thereby the heart's affection which preceded that\nthey might be made, groweth because they are made. But still if any be in that way held, or even\nbound, that he is not able to do these things with his limbs, it does not follow that the inner man\ndoes not pray, and before the eyes of God in its most secret chamber, where it hath compunction, cast\nitself on the ground. So likewise, while it makes very much difference, where a person deposits the\nbody of his dead, while he supplicates for his spirit unto God, because both the affection preceding\nchose a spot which was holy, and after the body is there deposited the recalling to mind of that holy\nspot renews and increases the affection which had preceded; yet, though he may not be able in that\nplace which his religious mind did choose to lay in the ground him whom he loves, in no wise ought he\nto cease from necessary supplications in commending of the same. For wheresoever the flesh of the\ndeparted may lie or not lie, the spirit requires rest and must get it: for the spirit in its\ndeparting from thence took with it the consciousness without which it could make no odds how one\nexists, whether in a good estate or a bad: and it does not look for aiding of its life from that\nflesh to which it did itself afford the life which it withdrew in its departing, and is to render\nback in its returning; since not flesh to spirit, but spirit unto flesh procureth merit even of very\nresurrection whether it be unto punishment or unto glory that it is to come to life again.","index":"20","references":[{"fn":"48","code":"P4874_2391703","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Orantes..","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"8.

But if we consider a man's human affection\ntowards his own flesh, it was possible for him to be frightened or saddened, while living, by that\noff which he would have no sense when dead: and this was a punishment, because the mind was pained by\nthat thing about to happen to its body, howsoever when it did happen it would feel no pain. To this\nintent, namely, it pleased the Lord to punish His servant, who not of his own contumacy had spurned\nto fulfill His command, but by deceit of another's falsehood thought himself to be obeying when he\nobeyed not.

God was able, no\ndoubt, (even as He permitted not the lion when it had slain the Prophet, to touch his body further,\nand of a slayer made it to be a keeper): He was able, I say, to have kept the slain bodies of His own\nfrom the dogs to which they had been flung; He was able in innumerable ways to have deterred the rage\nof the men themselves, that to burn the carcases, to scatter the ashes, they should not dare: but it\nwas fit that this experience also should not be lacking to manifold variety of temptations, lest the\nfortitude of confession which would not for the saving of the life of the body give way to the\nsavageness of persecution, should be tremblingly anxious for the honor of a sepulchre: in a word,\nlest faith of resurrection should dread the consuming of the body. It was fit then, that even these\nthings should be permitted, in order that, even after these examples of so great horror, the Martyrs,\nfervent in confession of Christ, should become witnesses of this truth also, in which they had\nlearned that they by whom their bodies should be slain had after that no more that they could\ndo.[fn-48-P4883_2400747:28-nf] Because, whatever they should do to\ndead bodies, they would after all do nothing, seeing that in flesh devoid of all life, neither was it\npossible for him to feel aught who had thence departed, nor for Him to lose aught thereof, Who\ncreated the same.

Stories are told of certain appearances or visions,[fn-48-P4888_2403551:31-nf] which may seem to bring into this discussion a\nquestion which should not be slighted. It is said, namely, that dead men have at times either in\ndreams or in some other way appeared to the living who knew not where their bodies lay unburied, and\nhave pointed out to them the place, and admonished that the sepulture which was lacking should be\nafforded them. These things if we shall answer to be false, we shall be thought impudently to\ncontradict the writings of certain faithful men, and the senses of them who assure us that such\nthings have happened to themselves. But it is to be answered, that it does not follow that we are to\naccount the dead to have sense of these things, because they appear in dreams to say or indicate or\nask this. For living men do also appear ofttimes to the living as they sleep, while they themselves\nknow not that they do appear; and they are told by them, what they dreamed, namely, that in their\ndream the speakers saw them doing or saying something. Then if it may be that a person in a dream\nshould see me indicating to him something that has happened or even foretelling something about to\nhappen, while I am perfectly unwitting of the thing and altogether regardless not only what he\ndreams, but whether he is awake while I am asleep, or he asleep while I am awake, or whether at one\nand the same time we are both awake or asleep, at what time he has the dream in which he sees me:\nwhat marvel if the dead be unconscious and insensible of these things, and, for all that, are seen by\nthe living in their dreams, and say something which those on awaking find to be true? By angelical\noperations, then, I should think it is effected, whether permitted from above, or commanded, that\nthey seem in dreams to say something about burying of their bodies, when they whose the bodies are\nare utterly unconscious of it. Now this is sometimes serviceably done; whether for some sort of\nsolace to the survivors, to whom pertain those dead whose likenesses[fn-48-P4889_2405549:32-nf] appear to them as they dream; or whether that by\nthese admonitions the human race may be made to have regard to humanity of sepulture, which, allow\nthat it be no help to the departed, yet is there culpable irreligiousness in slighting of it.\nSometimes however, by fallacious visions,[fn-48-P4890_2405848:33-nf]\nmen are cast into great errors, who deserve to suffer this. As, if one should see in a dream, what\nAeneas by poetic falsity is told to have seen in the world beneath: and there should appear to him\nthe likeness of some unburied man, which should speak such words as Palinurus is said to have spoken\nto him; and when he awakes, he should find the body in that place where he heard say while dreaming,\nthat it lay unburied, and was admonished and asked to bury it when found; and because he finds this\nto be true, should believe that the dead are buried on purpose that their souls may pass to places\nfrom which he dreamed that the souls of men unburied are by an infernal law prohibited: does he not,\nin believing all this, exceedingly swerve from the path of truth?","index":"25","references":[{"fn":"48","code":"P4888_2403551","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Visa..","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"48","code":"P4889_2405549","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Imagines.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"48","code":"P4890_2405848","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Visis..","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"13.

Of a surety, when we were at Milan,\nwe heard tell of a certain person of whom was demanded payment of a debt, with production of his\ndeceased father's acknowledgment,[fn-48-P4892_2407257:34-nf] which\ndebt unknown to the son the father had paid, whereupon the man began to be very sorrowful, and to\nmarvel that his father while dying did not tell him what he owed when he also made his will.

A certain man by name Curma, of the municipal town of Tullium, which is hard by Hippo, a\npoor member of the Curia,[fn-48-P4898_2410626:38-nf] scarcely\ncompetent to serve the office of a duumvir[fn-48-P4899_2410694:39-nf]\nof that place, and a mere rustic, being ill, and all his senses entranced, lay all but dead for\nseveral days: a very slight breathing in his nostrils, which on applying the hand was just felt, and\nbarely betokened that he lived, was all that kept him from being buried for dead. Not a limb did he\nstir, nothing did he take in the way of sustenance, neither in the eyes nor in any other bodily sense\nwas he sensible of any annoyance that impinged upon them. Yet he was seeing many things like as in a\ndream, which, when at last after a great many days he woke up, he told that he had seen. And first,\npresently after he opened his eyes, Let some one go, said he, to the house of Curma the smith, and\nsee what is doing there. And when some one had gone thither, the smith was found to have died in that\nmoment that the other had come back to his senses, and, it might almost be said, revived from death.\nThen, as those who stood by eagerly listened, he told them how the other had been ordered to be had\nup, when he himself was dismissed; and that he had heard it said in that place from which he had\nreturned, that it was not Curma of the Curia, but Curma the smith who had been ordered to be fetched\nto that place of the dead. Well, in these dream-like visions of his, among those deceased persons\nwhom he saw handled according to the diversity of their merits, he recognized also some whom he had\nknown when alive. That they were the very persons themselves I might perchance have believed, had he\nnot in the course of this seeming dream of his seen also some who are alive even to this present\ntime, namely, some clerks of his district, by whose presbyter there he was told to be baptized at\nHippo by me, which thing he said had also taken place. So then he had seen a presbyter, clerks,\nmyself, persons, to wit, not yet dead, in this vision in which he afterwards also saw dead persons.\nWhy may he not be thought to have seen these last in the same way as he saw us? that is, both the one\nsort, and the other, absent and unconscious, and consequently not the persons themselves, but\nsimilitudes of them just as of the places? He saw, namely, both a plot of ground where was that\npresbyter with the clerks, and Hippo where he was by me seemingly baptized: in which spots assuredly\nhe was not, when he seemed to himself to be there. For what was at that time going on there, he knew\nnot: which, without doubt, he would have known if he had verily been there. The sights beheld,\ntherefore, were those which are not presented in the things themselves as they are, but shadowed\nforth in a sort of images of the things. In fine, after much that he saw, he narrated how he had,\nmoreover, been led into Paradise, and how it was there said to him, when he was thence dismissed to\nreturn to his own family, \"Go, be baptized, if thou wilt be in this place of the blessed.\" Thereupon,\nbeing admonished to be baptized by me, he said it was done already. He who was talking with him\nreplied, \"Go, be truly baptized; for that thou didst but see in the vision.\" After this he recovered,\nwent his way to Hippo. Easter was now approaching, he gave his name among the other Competents, alike\nwith very many unknown to us; nor did he care to make known the vision to me or to any of our people.\nHe was baptized, at the close of the holy days he returned to his own place. After the space of two\nyears or more, I learned the whole matter; first, through a certain friend of mine and his at my own\ntable, while we were talking about some such matters: then I took it up, and made the man in his own\nperson tell me the story, in the presence of some honest townsmen of his attesting the same, both\nconcerning his marvellous illness, how he lay all but dead for many days, and about that other Curma\nthe smith, what I have mentioned above, and about all these matters; which, while he was telling me,\nthey recalled to mind, and assured me, that they had also at that time heard them from his lips.\nWherefore, just as he saw his own baptism, and myself, and Hippo, and the basilica, and the\nbaptistery, not in the very realities, but in a sort of similitudes of the things; and so likewise\ncertain other living persons, without consciousness on the part of the same living persons: then why\nnot just so those dead persons also, without consciousness on the part of the same dead persons?","index":"28","references":[{"fn":"48","code":"P4898_2410626","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Curialis..","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"48","code":"P4899_2410694","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Duumviralitius..","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"16.

Hence too is solved that question, how is it that the Martyrs, by the very benefits which are\ngiven to them that pray, indicate that they take an interest in the affairs of men, if the dead know\nnot what the quick are doing.

Howbeit it is a question which surpasses the strength of my understanding, after what manner\nthe Martyrs aid them who by them, it is certain, are helped; whether themselves by themselves be\npresent at the same time in so different places, and by so great distance lying apart one from\nanother, either where their Memorials are, or beside their Memorials, wheresoever they are felt to be\npresent: or whether, while they themselves, in a place congruous with their merits, are removed from\nall converse with mortals, and yet do in a general sort pray for the needs of their suppliants, (like\nas we pray for the dead, to whom however we are not present, nor know where they be or what they be\ndoing,) God Almighty, Who is every where present, neither bounded in[fn-49-P4920_2425854:55-nf] with us nor remote from us, hearing and granting\nthe Martyrs' prayers, doth by angelic ministries every where diffused afford to men those solaces, to\nwhom in the misery of this life He seeth meet to afford the same, and, touching His Martyrs, doth\nwhere He will, when He will, how He will, and chiefest through their Memorials, because this He\nknoweth to be expedient for us unto edifying of the faith of Christ for Whose confession they\nsuffered, by marvellous and ineffable power and goodness cause their merits to be had in honor.

Such, we may believe, was that John the Monk, whom the elder Theodosius, the Emperor,\nconsulted concerning the issue of the civil war: seeing he had also the gift of prophecy. For that\nnot each several person has a several one of those gifts, but that one man may have more gifts than\none, I make no question. This John, then, when once a certain most religious woman desired to see\nhim, and to obtain this did through her husband make vehement entreaty, refused indeed this request\nbecause he had never allowed this to women, but \"Go,\" said be, \"tell thy wife, she shall see me this\nnight, but in her sleep.\" And so it came to pass: and he gave her advice, whatever was meet to be\ngiven to a wedded believing woman. And she, on her awaking, made known to her husband that she had\nseen a man of God, such as he knew him to be, and what she had been told by him. The person who\nlearned this from them, reported it to me, a grave man and a noble, and most worthy to be believed.\nBut if I myself had seen that holy monk, because (it is said) he was most patient in hearing\nquestions and most wise in answering, I would have sought of him, as touching our question, whether\nhe himself came to that woman in sleep, that is to say, his spirit in the form of his body, just as\nwe dream that we see ourselves in the form of our own body; or whether, while he himself was doing\nsomething else, or, if asleep, was dreaming of something else, it was either by an Angel or in some\nother way that such vision took place in the woman's dream; and that it would so be, as he promised,\nhe himself foreknew by the Spirit of prophecy revealing the same. For if he was himself present to\nher in her dream, of course it was by miraculous grace that he was enabled so to do, not by nature;\nand by God's gift, not by faculty of his own. But if, while he was doing some other thing or sleeping\nand occupied with other sights, the woman saw him in her sleep, then doubtless some such thing took\nplace, as that is which we read in the Acts of the Apostles, where the Lord Jesus speaks to Ananias\nconcerning Saul,[fn-49-P4932_2430043:66-nf] and informs him that Saul\nhas seen Ananias coming unto him, while Ananias himself wist not of it. The man of God would make\nanswer to me of these things as the case might be, and then about the Martyrs I should go on to ask\nof him, whether they be themselves present in dreams, or in whatever other way to those who see them\nin what shape they will; and above all when the demons in men confess themselves tormented by the\nMartyrs, and ask them to spare them; or whether these things be wrought through angelic powers, to\nthe honor and commendation of the Saints for men's profit, while those are in supreme rest, and\nwholly free for other far better sights, apart from us, and praying for us. For it chanced at Milan\nat (the tomb of) the holy Martyrs Protasius and Gervasius, that Ambrose the bishop, at that time\nliving, being expressly named, in like manner as were the dead whose names they were rehearsing, the\ndemons confessed him and besought him to spare them, he being the while otherwise engaged, and when\nthis was taking place, altogether unwitting of it. Or whether indeed these things are wrought,\nsomewhiles by very presence of the Martyrs, otherwhiles by that of Angels; and whether it be\npossible, or by what tokens possible, for us to discriminate these two cases; or whether to perceive\nand to judge of these things none be able, but he which hath that gift through God's Spirit,\n\"dividing unto every man severally as He will:\"[fn-49-P4933_2431508:67-nf] the same John, me-thinks, would discourse to me\nof all these matters, as I should wish; that either by his teaching I might learn, and what I should\nbe, told should know to be true and certain; or I should believe what I knew not, upon his telling me\nwhat things he knew. But if peradventure he should make answer out of holy Scripture, and say,\n\"Things higher than thou, seek thou not; and things stronger than thou, search thou not; but what the\nLord hath commanded thee, of those things bethink thee alway:\"[fn-49-P4934_2432040:68-nf] this also I should thankfully accept. For it is\nno small gain if, when any things are obscure and uncertain to us, and we not able to comprehend\nthem, it be at any rate clear and certain that we are not to seek them; and what thing each one\nwishes to learn, accounting it to be profitable that he should know it, he should learn that it is no\nharm that he know it not.","index":"34","references":[{"fn":"49","code":"P4932_2430043","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Acts ix. 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"the acts","chapter":9,"verses":[12]}]},{"fn":"49","code":"P4933_2431508","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"1 Cor. xii. 11.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":12,"verses":[11]}]},{"fn":"49","code":"P4934_2432040","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Ecclus. iii. 22.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"22.
