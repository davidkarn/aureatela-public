It is the Day of the Resurrection, and my Beginning has good auspices. Let us then keep the Festival with splendour,[fn-29-P2986_849743:1-nf] and let us embrace one another. Let us say Brethren, even to those who hate us; much more to those who have done or suffered aught out of love for us. Let us forgive all offences for the Resurrection's sake: let us give one another pardon, I for the noble tyranny, which I have suffered (for I can now call it noble); and you who exercised it, if you had cause to blame my tardiness; for perhaps this tardiness may be more precious in God's sight than the haste of others. For it is a good thing even to hold back from God for a little while, as did the great Moses of old,[fn-29-P2987_850334:2-nf] and Jeremiah[fn-29-P2988_850362:3-nf] later on; and then to run readily to Him when He calls, as did Aaron[fn-29-P2989_850445:4-nf] and Isaiah,[fn-29-P2990_850472:5-nf] so only both be done in a dutiful spirit;-the former because of his own want of strength; the latter because of the Might of Him That calleth.","index":"4","references":[{"fn":"29","code":"P2986_849743","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Isa. lxvi. 5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":66,"verses":[5]}]},{"fn":"29","code":"P2987_850334","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Ex. iv. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"exodus","chapter":4,"verses":[10]}]},{"fn":"29","code":"P2988_850362","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Jer. i. 6.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"29","code":"P2989_850445","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Ex. iv. 27.","bible_refs":[{"book":"exodus","chapter":4,"verses":[27]}]},{"fn":"29","code":"P2990_850472","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Isa.
