Now ye must know that this figure is found in ancient history. For when Pharaoh, that most bitter and cruel tyrant, was oppressing the free and high-born people of the Hebrews, God sent Moses to bring them out of the evil bondage of the Egyptians. Then the door posts were anointed with the blood of a lamb, that the destroyer might flee from the houses which had the sign of the blood; and the Hebrew people was marvellously delivered. The enemy, however, after their rescue, pursued after them[fn-27-P2718_774162:4-nf] , and saw the sea wondrously parted for them; nevertheless he went on, following close in their footsteps, and was all at once overwhelmed and engulphed in the Red Sea.","index":"6","references":[{"fn":"27","code":"P2717_773165","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"th\\n e!mfasin th/n. . . . gegenhme/nhn, is found in all the Mss. \"Nevertheless it would seem that we ought to read tw=n . . . . gegenhme/nwn,which Grodecq either read or substituted\" (Ben.
