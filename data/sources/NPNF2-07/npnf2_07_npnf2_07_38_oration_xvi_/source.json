A series of disasters had befallen the people of Nazianzus. A deadly cattle plague, which had devastated their herds, had been followed by a prolonged drought, and now their just ripened crops had been ruined by a storm of rain and hail. The people flocked to the church, and finding S. Gregory the elder so overwhelmed by his sense of these terrible misfortunes that he was unable to address them, implored his coadjutor to enter the pulpit. The occasion gave no time for preparation, so S. Gregory poured out his feelings in a discourse which was in the fullest sense of the words ex tempore. its present form, however, as Benoit suggests, may be due to a later polishing of notes taken down at the time of delivery.","index":"4","references":[]},{"text":"1. Why do you infringe upon the approved order of things? Why would you do violence to a tongue which is under obligation to the law? Why do you challenge a speech which is in subjection to the Spirit? Why, when you have excused the head, have you hastened to the feet? Why do you pass by Aaron[fn-37-P3722_1083141:1-nf] and urge forward Eleazar? I cannot allow the fountain to be dammed up, while the rivulet runs its course; the sun to be hidden, while the star shines forth; hoar hairs to be in retirement, while youth lays down the law; wisdom to be silent, while inexperience speaks with assurance. A heavy rain is not always more useful than a gentle shower. Nay, indeed, if it be too violent, it sweeps away the earth, and increases the proportion of the farmer's loss: while a gentle fall, which sinks deep, enriches the soil, benefits the tiller and makes the corn grow to a fine crop. So the fluent Speech is not more profitable than the wise. For the one, though it perhaps gave a slight pleasure, passes away, and is dispersed as soon, and with as little effect, as the air on which it struck, though it charms with its eloquence the greedy ear. But the other sinks into the mind, and opening wide its mouth, fills it[fn-37-P3723_1084113:2-nf] with the Spirit, and, showing itself nobler than its origin, produces a rich harvest by a few syllables.","index":"5","references":[{"fn":"37","code":"P3722_1083141","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Aaron, S.

I have not yet alluded to the true and first wisdom, for which our wonderful husbandman and shepherd is conspicuous. The first wisdom is a life worthy of praise, and kept pure for God, or being purified for Him Who is all-pure and all-luminous, Who demands of us, us His only sacrifice, purification-that is, a contrite heart and the sacrifice of praise,[fn-37-P3725_1084593:3-nf] and a new creation in Christ,[fn-37-P3726_1084645:4-nf] and the new man,[fn-37-P3727_1084679:5-nf] and the like, as the Scripture loves to call it. The first wisdom is to despise that wisdom which consists of language and figures of speech, and spurious and unnecessary embellishments. Be it mine to speak five words with my understanding in the church, rather than ten thousand words in a tongue,[fn-37-P3728_1084994:6-nf] and with the unmeaning voice of a trumpet,[fn-37-P3729_1085056:7-nf] which does not rouse my soldier to the spiritual combat.

Tell us whence come such blows and scourges, and what account we can give of them. Is it some disordered and irregular motion or some unguided current, some unreason of the universe, as though there were no Ruler of the world, which is therefore borne along by chance, as is the doctrine of the foolishly wise, who are themselves borne along at random by the disorderly spirit of darkness? Or are the disturbances and changes of the universe, (which was originally constituted, blended, bound together, and set in motion in a harmony known only to Him Who gave it motion,) directed by reason and order under the guidance of the reins of Providence? Whence come famines and tornadoes and hailstorms, our present warning blow? Whence pestilences, diseases, earthquakes, tidal waves, and fearful things in the heavens? And how is the creation, once ordered for the enjoyment of men, their common and equal delight, changed for the punishment of the ungodly, in order that we may be chastised through that for which, when honoured with it, we did not give thanks, and recognise in our sufferings that power which we did not recognise in our benefits? How is it that some receive at the Lord's hand double for their sins,[fn-37-P3754_1090584:29-nf] and the measure of their wickedness is doubly filled up, as in the correction of Israel, while the sins of others are done away by a sevenfold recompense into their bosom?[fn-37-P3755_1090774:30-nf] What is the measure of the Amorites that is not yet full?[fn-37-P3756_1090852:31-nf] And how is the sinner either let go, or chastised again, let go perhaps, because reserved for the other world, chastised, because healed thereby in this?

What is our calamity, and what its cause? Is it a test of virtue, or a touchstone of wickedness? And is it better to bow beneath it as a chastisement, even though it be not so, and humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God,[fn-37-P3757_1091529:32-nf] or, considering it as a trial, to rise superior to it?

Terrible is an unfruitful season, and the loss of the crops. It could not be otherwise, when men are already rejoicing in their hopes, and counting on their all but harvested stores. Terrible again is an unseasonable harvest, when the farmers labour with heavy hearts, sitting as it were beside the grave of their crops, which the gentle rain nourished, but the wild storm has rooted up, whereof the mower filleth not his hand, neither he that bindeth up the sheaves his bosom,[fn-37-P3759_1092387:33-nf] nor have they obtained the blessing which passers-by bestow upon the farmers.

Our prolific crops reduced to stubble, the seed we sowed is recognised by scanty remains, and our harvest, the approach of which we reckon from the number of the months, instead of from the ripening corn, scarcely bears the firstfruits for the Lord. Such is the wealth of the ungodly, such the harvest of the careless sower; as the ancient curse runs, to look for much, and bring in little,[fn-38-P3842_1112905:105-nf] to sow and not reap, to plant and not press,[fn-38-P3843_1112969:106-nf] ten acres of vineyard to yield one hath:[fn-38-P3844_1113028:107-nf] and to hear of fertile harvests in other lands, and be ourselves pressed by famine. Why is this, and what is the cause of the breach? Let us not wait to be convicted by others, let us be our own examiners. An important medicine for evil is confession, and care to avoid stumbling. I will be first to do so, as I have made my report to my people from on high, and performed the duty of a watcher.[fn-38-P3845_1113449:108-nf] For I did not conceal the coming of the sword that I might save my own soul[fn-38-P3846_1113545:109-nf] and those of my hearers. So will I now announce the disobedience of my people, making what is theirs my own, if I may perchance thus obtain some tenderness and relief.","index":"21","references":[{"fn":"38","code":"P3840_1112239","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Ib. i. 6.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"38","code":"P3841_1112401","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"2 Sam. i. 21.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 samuel","chapter":1,"verses":[21]}]},{"fn":"38","code":"P3842_1112905","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Ps. lxv. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":65,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"38","code":"P3843_1112969","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Hag. i. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"haggai","chapter":1,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"38","code":"P3844_1113028","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Deut. xxviii. 39.","bible_refs":[{"book":"deuteronomy","chapter":28,"verses":[39]}]},{"fn":"38","code":"P3845_1113449","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Isai. v. 10.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"38","code":"P3846_1113545","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Ib. xxi. 6; lxii. 6; Habak. ii. 1.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"18.
