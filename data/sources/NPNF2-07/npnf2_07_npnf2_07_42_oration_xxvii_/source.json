It is when we are free from all external defilement or disturbance, and when that which rules within us is not confused with vexatious or erring images; like persons mixing up good writing with bad, or filth with the sweet odours of unguents.

I must not be misunderstood, or I shall be having these nimble and quick people down upon me again. For we ought to think of God even more often than we draw our breath; and if the expression is permissible, we ought to do nothing else. Yea, I am one of those who entirely approve that Word which bids us meditate day and night,[fn-41-P4199_1283661:12-nf] and tell at eventide and morning and noon day,[fn-42-P4200_1283723:13-nf] and praise the Lord at every time;[fn-42-P4201_1283775:14-nf] or, to use Moses' words, whether a man lie down, or rise up, or walk by the way, or whatever else he be doing[fn-42-P4202_1283904:15-nf] -and by this recollection we are to be moulded to purity.

Surely not, my friends and brethren (for I will still call you Brethren, though you do not behave like brothers). Let us not think so nor yet, like hot tempered and hard mouthed horses, throwing off our rider Reason, and casting away Reverence, that keeps us within due limits, run far away from the turning point? but let us philosophize within our proper bounds, and not be carried away into Egypt, nor be swept down into Assyria[fn-42-P4205_1285204:18-nf] , nor sing the Lord's song in a strange land, by which I mean before any kind of audience, strangers or kindred, hostile or friendly, kindly or the reverse, who watch what we do with over great care, and would like the spark of what is wrong in us to become a flame, and secretly kindle and fan it and raise it to heaven with their breath and make it higher than the Babylonian flame which burnt up every thing around it. For since their strength lies not in their own dogmas, they hunt for it in our weak points. And therefore they apply themselves to our-shall I say \"misfortunes\" or \"failings\"?-like flies to wounds. But let us at least be no longer ignorant of ourselves, or pay too little attention to the due order in these matters. And if it be impossible to put an end to the existing hostility, let us at least agree upon this, that we will utter Mysteries under our breath, and holy things in a holy manner, and we will not cast to ears profane that which may not be uttered, nor give evidence that we possess less gravity than those who worship demons, and serve shameful fables and deeds; for they would sooner give their blood to the uninitiated than certain words. But let us recognize that as in dress and diet and laughter and demeanour there is a certain decorum, so there is also in speech and silence; since among so many titles and powers of God, we pay the highest honour to The Word. Let even our disputings then be kept within bounds.","index":"12","references":[{"fn":"41","code":"P4199_1283661","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Ps. i. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":1,"verses":[2]}]},{"fn":"42","code":"P4200_1283723","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Ps. lv. 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":55,"verses":[17]}]},{"fn":"42","code":"P4201_1283775","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Ps. xxxiv. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":34,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"42","code":"P4202_1283904","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Deut. vi. 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"deuteronomy","chapter":6,"verses":[7]}]},{"fn":"42","code":"P4203_1284274","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Prov. xxv. 16.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","chapter":25,"verses":[16]}]},{"fn":"42","code":"P4204_1284361","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Eccles. iii. 1.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"42","code":"P4205_1285204","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"The course of the chariot races in the Greek Games was round the Hippodrome a certain number of times.

The object of the charioteers was to turn round these as close as possible, to save distance; and to do this well it was necessary to have the horses under perfect control, as well as perfectly trained, to make the semicircle at full gallop almost on the axis of the car.

Of course you will admit that there are many, and not only one. Now, are they all to be filled, or only some, and others not; so that some will be left empty, and will have been prepared to no purpose? Of course all will be filled, for nothing can be in vain which has been done by God. And can you tell me what you will consider this Mansion to be? Is it the rest and glory which is in store There for the Blessed, or something else?-No, not anything else. Since then we are agreed upon this point, let us further examine another also. Is there any thing that procures these Mansions, as I think there is; or is there nothing?-Certainly there is-What is it? Is it not that there are various modes of conduct, and various purposes, one leading one way, another way, according to the proportion of faith, and these we call Ways? Must we, then, travel all, or some of these Ways ... the same individual along them all, if that be possible; or, if not, along as many as may be; or else along some of them?
