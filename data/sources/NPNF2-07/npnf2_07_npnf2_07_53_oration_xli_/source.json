Let us reason a little about the Festival, that we may keep it spiritually. For different persons have different ways of keeping Festival; but to the worshipper of the Word a discourse seems best; and of discourses, that which is best adapted to the occasion. And of all beautiful things none gives so much joy to the lover of the beautiful, as that the lover of festivals should keep them spiritually. Let us look into the matter thus. The Jew keeps festival as well as we, but only in the letter. For while following after the bodily Law, he has not attained to the spiritual Law. The Greek too keeps festival, but only in the body, and in honour of his own gods and demons, some of whom are creators of passion by their own admission, and others were honoured out of passion. Therefore even their manner of keeping festival is passionate, as though their very sin were an honour to God, in Whom their passion takes refuge as a thing to be proud of.[fn-53-P5351_1779812:1-nf] We too keep festival, but we keep it as is pleasing to the Spirit. And it is pleasing to Him that we should keep it by discharging some duty, either of action or speech. This then is our manner of keeping festival, to treasure up in our soul some of those things which are permanent and will cleave 'to it, not of those which will forsake us and be destroyed, and which only tickle our senses for a little while; whereas they are for the most part, m my judgment at least, harmful and ruinous. For sufficient unto the body is the evil thereof. What need has that fire of further fuel, or that beast of more plentiful food, to make it more uncontrollable, and too violent for reason?","index":"10","references":[{"fn":"53","code":"P5351_1779812","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"They deify bad passions, and then act as if the gratification of them were an honour to the gods in whom they have personified them.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"II. Wherefore we must keep the feast spiritually. And this is the beginning of our discourse; for we must speak, even if our speech do seem a little too discursive; and we must be diligent for the sake of those who love learning, that we may as it were mix up some seasoning with our solemn festival. The children of the Hebrews do honour to the number Seven, according to the legislation of Moses (as did the Pythagoreans in later days to the number Four, by which indeed they were in the habit of swearing[fn-53-P5353_1781138:2-nf] as the Simonians and Marcionites[fn-53-P5354_1781376:3-nf] do by the number Eight and the number Thirty, inasmuch as they have given names to and reverence a system of Aeons of these numbers); I cannot say by what rules of analogy, or in consequence of what power of this number; anyhow they do honour to it. One thing indeed is evident, that God, having in six days created matter, and given it form, and having arranged it in all kinds of shapes and mixtures, and having made this present visible world, on the seventh day rested from all His works, as is shewn by the very name of the Sabbath, which in Hebrew means Rest. If there be, however, any more lofty reason than this, let others discuss it. But this honour which they pay to it is not confined to days alone, but also extends to years. That belonging to days the Sabbath proves, because it is continually observed among them; and in accordance with this the removal of leaven is for that number of days.[fn-53-P5355_1783803:4-nf] And that belonging to years is shewn by the seventh year, the year of Release;[fn-53-P5356_1783900:5-nf] and it consists not only of Hebdomads, but of Hebdomads of Hebdomads, alike in days and years. The Hebdomads of days give birth to Pentecost, a day called holy among them; and those of years to what they call the Jubilee, which also has a release of land, and a manumission of slaves, and a release of possessions bought. For this nation consecrates to God, not only the firstfruits of offspring, or of firstborn, but also those of days and years. Thus the veneration paid to the number Seven gave rise also to the veneration of Pentecost. For seven being multiplied by seven generates fifty all but one day, which we borrow from the world to come, at once the Eighth and the first, or rather one and indestructible. For the present sabbatism of our souls can find its cessation there, that a portion may be given to seven and also to eight[fn-53-P5357_1784756:6-nf] (so some of our predecessors have interpreted this passage of Solomon).","index":"11","references":[{"fn":"53","code":"P5353_1781138","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"The followers of Pythagoras swore by their master, who taught them the mystic properties of the number Four, which he called the Fountain of the Universe, because all things were made of four elements.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"53","code":"P5354_1781376","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"The Simonians and Marcionites were two Gnostic sects, the one deriving its name form Simon Magus, the other from Marcion of Sinope.

He maintained a system of Emanations from God, of which he claimed to be himself the chief. In his teaching the first cause of all things was an Ineffable Existence or Non-existence, which he sometimes called Silence and sometimes Fire, from which the Universe was generated by a series of six Emanations called Roots, which he arranged in pairs, male and female; and these six contained among them the whole Essence of his first Principle Silence.

John Chrysostom's account of the seven fold punishment which was inflicted on Cain. The number Seven he says (Hom. in Gen. xix. 5, p. 168 c.) is often used in Holy Scripture in the sense of multitude, as e.g., in such places, as, \"The barren hath borne seven,\" and the like. So here; the greatness of the crime is implied, and that it is not a simple and single crime, but seven sins; and those of such a sort that every one of them must be avenged by a very severe punishment. First, that he envied his brother when he saw that God loved him, a sin which without any other added to it was sufficient to be deadly. The next was that this sin was against a brother. The third that he compassed a deceit. The fourth that he perpetrated a murder. The fifth that it was his brother that he slew. The sixth that he was the first man to commit a murder. The seventh that he lied to God. You have followed these steps with your mind, or do you desire that I should repeat the enumeration in a fuller way, to make you understand how each of these sins would be visited with a very severe penalty, even if it stood alone. Who would judge a man worthy of pardon who envies another simply because he enjoys the favour and love of God? Here then is one very great and inexpiable sin. And this is shewn to be even more atrocious when he who is envied is a brother, and has done him no wrong. Further, he contrived a deceit, bringing his brother out by a trick into the field, without reverence for nature herself. The fourth crime is the murder which he committed. The fifth is that it was his brother whom he put to death; his brother, I say, that came out of the same womb. Sixthly, he was the first inventor of murder. Seventhly, when questioned by God he did not hesitate to lie. And therefore because he dared to lay hands on his brother, he draws upon himself severe punishments. He then proceeds to shew how Lamech's crime was worse than Cain's, and is therefore said to be punished seventy times; that is, in manifold ways. Lamech slew a man and a young man, and this, after the law against murder had been given; that is, after God had punished Cain. Cain's punishment he says was sevenfold, corresponding to his seven sins: - 1. Cursed is the ground for thy sake. 2. Thou shalt till the ground; i.e., thou shalt never rest from the toils of husbandry. 3. It shall not yield unto thee its strength; 4. thy labours shall be barren, and 5. \"sighting and trembling\" shalt thou be. And the sixth is from the lips of Cain himself: - \"If Thou castest me out form the earth,\" i.e., from all earthly conveniences, \"from Thy face shall I be hid.\" And God put a mark upon Cain; this is the seventh punishment - a mark of infamy declaring his guilt and shame to all that should see him. Others according to the same authority (and Bishop Wordsworth adopts the explanation) explains it thus. From Cain to the Deluge are seven generations, and then the world was punished because sin had spread far and wide. But Lamech's sin could not be cured by the Deluge, but only by Him Who taketh away the sin of the world. Then count all the generations from Adam to Christ, and according to the Genealogy in Luke, you will find that our Lord was born in the seventieth generation. This is S. Jerome's explanation.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":19,"verses":[5]},{"book":"genesis","chapter":19,"verses":[5]},{"book":"genesis","chapter":19,"verses":[5]},{"book":"genesis","chapter":19,"verses":[5]},{"book":"genesis","chapter":19,"verses":[5]},{"book":"genesis","chapter":19,"verses":[5]},{"book":"genesis","chapter":19,"verses":[5]},{"book":"genesis","chapter":19,"verses":[5]},{"book":"genesis","chapter":19,"verses":[5]}]},{"fn":"53","code":"P5365_1789533","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Ps. lxxix. 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":79,"verses":[12]}]},{"fn":"53","code":"P5366_1789600","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Prov. ix. i.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"53","code":"P5367_1789674","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Zech. iii. 9 .","bible_refs":[{"book":"zechariah","chapter":3,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"53","code":"P5368_1789732","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Ps. cxix. 164.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":119,"verses":[164]}]},{"fn":"53","code":"P5369_1789788","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"1 Sam. ii. 5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 samuel","chapter":2,"verses":[5]}]},{"fn":"53","code":"P5370_1789893","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Peninnah who had \"many\" children is called Imperfect in her children, because Many is an indefinite word; where Hannah's one child Samuel was so perfect a man that he was as it were seven to his mother.

And if we must also look at ancient history, I perceive that Enoch,[fn-53-P5372_1790432:19-nf] the seventh among our ancestors, was honoured by translation. I perceive also that the twenty-first, Abraham,[fn-53-P5373_1790556:20-nf] was given the glory of the Patriarchate, by the addition of a greater mystery. For the Hebdomad thrice repeated brings out this number. And one who is very bold might venture even to come to the New Adam, my God and Lord Jesus Christ, Who is counted the Seventy-seventh from the old Adam who fell under sin, in the backward genealogy according to Luke.[fn-53-P5374_1790926:21-nf] And I think of the seven trumpets of Jesus, the son of Nave, and the same number of circuits and days and priests, by which the walls of Jericho were shaken down.[fn-53-P5375_1791108:22-nf] And so too the seven compassings of the City; in the same way as there is a mystery in the threefold breathings of Elias, the Prophet, by which he breathed life into the son of the Sareptan widow,[fn-53-P5376_1791327:23-nf] and the same number of his floodings of the wood,[fn-53-P5377_1791399:24-nf] when he consumed the sacrifice with fire sent from God, and condemned the prophets of shame who could not do the like at his challenge.

But why do I speak of the distant past? Jesus Himself who is pure perfection, could in the desert and with five loaves feed five thousand, and again with seven loaves four thousand. And the leavings after they were satisfied were in the first case twelve baskets full, and in the other seven baskets;[fn-53-P5384_1793026:31-nf] neither, I imagine, without a reason or unworthy of the Spirit.

But the Festival is never to be put an end to; but kept now indeed with our bodies; but a little later on altogether spiritually there, where we shall see the reasons of these things more purely and clearly, in the Word Himself, and God, and our Lord Jesus Christ, the True Festival and Rejoicing of the Saved-to Whom be the glory and the worship, with the Father and the Holy Ghost, now and for ever. Amen.","index":"27","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"28","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"29","references":[]}]}]}
