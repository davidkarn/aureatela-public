The root of all good works is the hope of the Resurrection; for the expectation of the recompense nerves the soul to good works. For every labourer is ready to endure the toils, if he sees their reward in prospect; but when men weary themselves for nought, their heart soon sinks as well as their body. A soldier who expects a prize is ready for war, but no one is forward to die for a king who is indifferent about those who serve under him, and bestows no honours on their toils. In like manner every soul believing in a Resurrection is naturally careful of itself; but, disbelieving it, abandons itself to perdition. He who believes that his body shall remain to rise again, is careful of his robe, and defiles it not with fornication; but he who disbelieves the Resurrection, gives himself to fornication, and misuses his own body, as though it were not his own. Faith therefore in the Resurrection of the dead, is a great commandment and doctrine of the Holy Catholic Church; great and most ncessary, though gainsaid by many, yet surely warranted by the truth. Greeks contradict it[fn-25-P2560_722680:1-nf] , Samaritans[fn-25-P2561_722721:2-nf] disbelieve it, heretics[fn-25-P2562_722765:3-nf] mutilate it; the contradiction is manifold, but the truth is uniform.","index":"6","references":[{"fn":"25","code":"P2560_722680","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Acts xvii. 32; xxvi. 24.","bible_refs":[{"book":"the acts","chapter":17,"verses":[32]},{"book":"the acts","chapter":17,"verses":[32]}]},{"fn":"25","code":"P2561_722721","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Cf. ยง 12, below.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"25","code":"P2562_722765","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Tertull.

Vultures and ravens feed on the flesh of the unburied dead, and then fly away over all the world; whence then is the body to be collected?

But the Greeks ask for a resurrection of the dead still manifest; and say that, even if these creatures are raised, yet they had not utterly mouldered away; and they require to see distinctly some creature rise again after complete decay. God knew men's unbelief, and provided for this purpose a bird, called a Phoenix[fn-25-P2580_731394:14-nf]  . This bird, as Clement writes, and as many more relate, being the only one of its kind[fn-25-P2581_732691:15-nf]  , arrives in the land of the Egyptians at periods of five hundred years, shewing forth the resurrection, not in desert places, lest the occurrence of the mystery should remain unknown, but appearing in a notable city[fn-25-P2582_733213:16-nf]  , that men might even handle what would otherwise be disbelieved. For it makes itself a coffin[fn-25-P2583_733675:17-nf]  of frankincense and myrrh and other spices, and entering into this when its years are fulfilled, it evidently dies and moulders away. Then from the decayed flesh of the dead bird a worm is engendered, and this worm when grown large is transformed into a bird;-and do not disbelieve this, for thou seest the offspring of bees also fashioned thus out of worms[fn-25-P2584_734241:18-nf] , and from eggs which are quite fluid thou hast seen wings and bones and sinews of birds issue. Afterwards the aforesaid Phoenix, becoming fledged and a full-grown Phoenix, like the former one, soars up into the air such as it had died, shewing forth to men a most evident resurrection of the dead. The Phoenix indeed is a wondrous bird, yet it is irrational, nor ever sang praise to God; it flies abroad through the sky, but it knows not who is the Only-begotten Son of God. Has then a resurrection from the dead been given to this irrational creature which knows not its Maker, and to us who ascribe glory to God and keep His commandments, shall there no resurrection be granted?","index":"13","references":[{"fn":"25","code":"P2580_731394","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"The story of the Phoenix as told by Herodotus, II. 73, is as follows: \"They have also another sacred bird called the Phoenix, wich I myself have never seen, except in pictures.
