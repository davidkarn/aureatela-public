He was justified not only by works, but also by faith[fn-6-P674_156140:19-nf] : for though he did many things well, yet he was never called the friend of God[fn-6-P675_156484:20-nf] , except when he believed. Moreover, his every work was performed in faith. Through faith he left his parents; left country, and place, and home through faith[fn-6-P676_156702:21-nf] . In like manner, therefore, as he was justified be thou justified also. In his body he was already dead in regard to offspring, and Sarah his wife was now old, and there was no hope left of having children. God promises the old man a child, and Abraham without being weakened in faith, though he considered his own body now as good as dead[fn-6-P677_157063:22-nf] , heeded not the weakness of his body, but the power of Him who promised, because he counted Him faithful who had promised[fn-6-P678_157204:23-nf] , and so beyond all expectation gained the child from bodies as it were already dead. And when, after he had gained his son, he was commanded to offer him up, although he had heard the word, In Isaac shall thy seed be called[fn-6-P679_157451:24-nf] , he proceeded to offer up his son, his only son, to God, believing that God is able to raise up even from the dead[fn-6-P680_157585:25-nf] . And having bound his son, and laid him on the wood, he did in purpose offer him, but by the goodness of God in delivering to him a lamb instead of his child, he received his son alive. Being faithful in these things, he was sealed for righteousness, and received circumcision as a seal of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision[fn-6-P681_157948:26-nf] , having received a promise that he should be the father of many nations[fn-6-P682_158040:27-nf] .","index":"12","references":[{"fn":"6","code":"P674_156140","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"James ii. 21.

But in learning the Faith and in professing it, acquire and keep that only, which is now delivered[fn-7-P714_166748:51-nf] to thee by the Church, and which has been built up strongly out of all the Scriptures. For since all cannot read the Scriptures, some being hindered as to the knowledge of them by want of learning, and others by a want of leisure, in order that the soul may not perish from ignorance, we comprise the whole doctrine of the Faith in a few lines. This summary I wish you both to commit to memory when I recite it[fn-7-P715_167296:52-nf] , and to rehearse it with all diligence among yourselves, not writing it out on paper[fn-7-P716_167470:53-nf] , but engraving it by the memory upon your heart[fn-7-P717_167609:54-nf] , taking care while you rehearse it that no Catechumen chance to overhear the things which have been delivered to you. I wish you also to keep this as a provision[fn-7-P718_168405:55-nf] through the whole course of your life, and beside this to receive no other, neither if we ourselves should change and contradict our present teaching, nor if an adverse angel, transformed into an angel of light[fn-7-P719_168636:56-nf] should wish to lead you astray. For though we or an angel from heaven preach to you any other gospel than that ye have received, let him be to you anathema[fn-7-P720_168811:57-nf] . So for the present listen while I simply say the Creed[fn-7-P721_168988:58-nf] , and commit it to memory; but at the proper season expect the confirmation out of Holy Scripture of each part of the contents. For the articles of the Faith were not composed as seemed good to men; but the most important points collected out of all the Scripture make up one complete teaching of the Faith. And just as the mustard seed in one small grain contains many branches, so also this Faith has embraced in few words all the knowledge of godliness in the Old and New Testaments. Take heed then, brethren, and hold fast the traditions[fn-7-P722_169576:59-nf] which ye now receive, and write them an the table of your heart[fn-7-P723_169674:60-nf] .","index":"20","references":[{"fn":"7","code":"P714_166748","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"e'p0 auQth=j th=j le/cewj. \"in ips√¢ lectione\" (Milles): \"ipsis verbis\" (Bened.): \"in the very phrase\" (R.
