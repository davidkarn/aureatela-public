A Fearful thing is sin, and the sorest disease of the soul is transgression, secretly cutting its sinews, and becoming also the cause of eternal fire; an evil of a man's own choosing, an offspring of the will[fn-2-P260_38831:1-nf] For that we sin of our own free will the Prophet says plainly in a certain place: Yet I planted thee a fruitful vine, wholly true: how art thou turned to bitterness, (and become) the strange vine[fn-2-P261_39048:2-nf] ? The planting was good, the fruit coming from the will is evil; and therefore the planter is blameless, but the vine shall be burnt with fire since it was planted for good, and bore fruit unto evil of its own will. For God, according to the Preacher, made man upright, and they have themselves sought out many inventions[fn-2-P262_39386:3-nf] . For we are His workmakship, says the Apostle, created unto good works, which God afore prepared, that we should walk in them[fn-2-P263_39533:4-nf] . So then the Creator, being good, created for good works; but the creature turned of its own free will to wickedness. Sin then is, as we have said, a fearful evil, but not incurable; fearful for him who clings to it, but easy of cure for him who by repentance puts it from him. For suppose that a man is holding fire in his hand; as long as he holds fast the live coal he is sure to be burned, but should he put away the coal, he would have cast away the flame also with it. If however any one thinks that he is not being burned when sinning, to him the Scripture saith, Shall a man wrap up fire in his bosom, and not burn his clothes[fn-2-P264_40185:5-nf] ?

The devil then is the first author of sin, and the father of the wicked: and this is the Lord's saying, not mine, that the devil sinneth from the beginning[fn-2-P274_42508:11-nf] : none sinned before him. But he sinned, not as having received necessarily from nature the propensity to sin, since then the cause of sin is traced back again to Him that made him so; but having been created good, he has of his own free will become a devil, and received that name from his action. For being an Archangel[fn-2-P275_42865:12-nf] he was afterwards called a devil from his slandering: from being a good servant of God he has become rightly named Satan; for \"Satan\" is interpreted the adversary[fn-2-P276_43089:13-nf] . And this is not my teaching, but that of the inspired prophet Ezekiel: for he takes up a lamentation over him and says, Thou wast a seal of likeness, and a crown of beauty; in the Paradise of God wast thou born[fn-2-P277_43325:14-nf] : and soon after, Thou wast born blameless in thy days, from the day in which thou wast created, until thine iniquities were found in thee. Very rightly hath he said, were found in thee; for they were not brought in from without, but thou didst thyself beget the evil. The cause also he mentions forthwith: Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty: for the multitude of thy sins wast thou wounded, and I did cast thee to the ground. In agreement with this the Lord says again in the Gospels: I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven[fn-2-P278_44301:15-nf] . Thou seest the harmony of the Old Testament with the New. He when cast out drew many away with him. It is he that puts lusts into them that listen to him: from him come adultery, fornication, and every kind of evil. Through him our forefather Adam was cast out for disobedience, and exchanged a Paradise bringing forth wondrous fruits of its own accord for the ground which bringeth forth thorns.","index":"10","references":[{"fn":"2","code":"P274_42508","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"1 John iii. 8; John viii. 44.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 john","chapter":3,"verses":[8]},{"book":"john","chapter":8,"verses":[44]},{"book":"1 john","chapter":3,"verses":[8]},{"book":"john","chapter":8,"verses":[44]}]},{"fn":"2","code":"P275_42865","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"On Cyril's doctrine of the Angels, see Index, \"Angels.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"2","code":"P276_43089","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"1 Kings v. 4, &c.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 kings","chapter":5,"verses":[4]}]},{"fn":"2","code":"P277_43325","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Ezek. xxviii. 12-17, an obscure passage, addressed to the Prince of Tyre, and meaning that he was \"the perfect pattern\" of earthly glory, set in a condition like that of Adam in Paradise, and, seemingly, blameless as Adam before his fall.

For when he had fallen sick, Esaias said to him, Set thine house in order; for thou shall die, and not live[fn-3-P317_58108:43-nf] . What expectation remained, what hope of recovery, when the Prophet said, for thou shalt die? Yet Hezekiah did not desist from repentance; but remembering what is written, When thou shalt turn and lament, then shalt thou be saved[fn-3-P318_58362:44-nf] , he turned to the wall, and from his bed lifting his mind to heaven (for thickness of walls is no hindrance to prayers sent up with devotion), he said, \"Remember me, O Lord, for it is sufficient for my healing that Thou remember me. Thou art not subject to times, but art Thyself the giver of the law of life. For our life depends not on a nativity, nor on a conjunction of stars, as some idly talk; but both of life and its duration. Then art Thyself the Lawgiver according to Thy Will.\" And he, who could not hope to live because of the prophetic sentence, had fifteen years added to his life, and for the sign the sun ran backward in his course Well then, for Ezekias' sake the sun turned back but for Christ the sun was eclipsed, not retracing his steps, but suffering eclipse[fn-3-P319_59824:45-nf] , and therefore shewing the difference between them, I mean between Ezekias and Jesus. The former prevailed to the cancelling of God's decree, and cannot Jesus grant remission of sins? Turn and bewail thyself, shut thy door, and pray to be forgiven, pray that He may remove from thee the burning flames.
