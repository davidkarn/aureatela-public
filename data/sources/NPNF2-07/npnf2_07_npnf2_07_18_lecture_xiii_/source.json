It was marvellous that she should have been loosed who had been bound by Satan eighteen years: yet what is this to all of us, who were fast bound in the chains of our sins?

Let us then not be ashamed of the Cross of our Saviour, but rather glory in it. For the word of the Cross is unto Jews a stumbling-block, and unto Gentiles foolishness, but to us salvation: and to them that are perishing it is foolishness, but unto us which are being saved it is the power of God[fn-16-P1609_443614:5-nf] . For it was not a mere man who died for us, as I said before, but the Son of God, God made man. Further; if the lamb under Moses drove the destroyer[fn-16-P1610_443785:6-nf] far away, did not much rather the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world[fn-16-P1611_443887:7-nf] , deliver us from our sins?

It is not Peter who says this, for then we might suspect that he was partial to his Teacher; but it is Esaias who says it, who was not indeed present with Him in the flesh, but in the Spirit foresaw His coming in the flesh.

And wouldest thou know certainly, that the Cross is a glory to Jesus? Hear His own words, not mine. Judas had become ungrateful to the Master of the house, and was about to betray Him. Having but just now gone forth from the table, and drunk His cup of blessing, in return for that drought of salvation he sought to shed righteous blood. He who did eat of His bread, was lifting up his heel against Him[fn-16-P1630_449072:23-nf] ; his hands were but lately receiving the blessed gifts[fn-16-P1631_449145:24-nf] , and presently for the wages of betrayal he was plotting His death.

Now is the Son of man glorified[fn-16-P1635_450511:28-nf] . Not that He was without glory before: for He was glorified with the glory which was before the foundation of the world[fn-16-P1636_450662:29-nf] . He was ever glorified as God; but now He was to be glorified in wearing the Crown of His patience. He gave not up His life by compulsion, nor was He put to death by murderous violence, but of His own accord. Hear what He says: I have power to lay down My life, and I have power to take it again[fn-16-P1637_450979:30-nf] : I yield it of My own choice to My enemies; for unless I chose, this could not be. He came therefore of His own set purpose to His passion, rejoicing in His noble deed, smiling at the crown, cheered by the salvation of mankind; not ashamed of the Cross, for it was to save the world. For it was no common man who suffered, but God in man's nature, striving for the prize of His patience.","index":"7","references":[{"fn":"16","code":"P1627_448342","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Ib. xxvi. 2.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"16","code":"P1628_448574","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Ib. xx. 18.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"16","code":"P1629_448650","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Luke ix. 5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":9,"verses":[5]}]},{"fn":"16","code":"P1630_449072","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"Ps. xli. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":41,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"16","code":"P1631_449145","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"\"ta\\j eu'logi/aj.

The beginning of signs under Moses was blood and water; and the last of all Jesus' signs was the same. First, Moses changed the river into blood; and Jesus at the last gave forth from His side water with blood. This was perhaps on account of the two speeches, his who judged Him, and theirs who cried out against Him; or because of the believers and the unbelievers. For Pilate said, I am innocent and washed his hands in water; they who cried out against Him said, His blood be upon us[fn-17-P1714_475311:92-nf] : there came therefore these two out of His side; the water, perhaps, for him who judged Him; but for them that shouted against Him the blood. And again it is to be understood in another way; the blood for the Jews, and the water for the Christians: for upon them as plotters came the condemnation from the blood but to thee who now believest, the salvation which is by water. For nothing has been done without a meaning. Our fathers who have written comments have given another reason of this matter. For since in the Gospels the power of salutary Baptism is twofold, one which is granted by means of water to the illuminated, and a second to holy martyrs, in persecutions, through their own blood, there came out of that saving Side blood and water[fn-17-P1715_476088:93-nf] , to confirm the grace of the confession made for Christ, whether in baptism, or on occasions of martyrdom. There is another reason also for mentioning the Side.
