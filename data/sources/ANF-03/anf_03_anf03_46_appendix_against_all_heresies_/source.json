The thirtieth ¦on, moreover, willed to see the great Bythus; and, to see him, had the hardihood to ascend into the upper regions; and not being capable of seeing his magnitude, desponded,[fn-112-P11203_3174963:57-nf] and almost suffered dissolution, had not some one,-he whom he calls Horos, to wit,-sent to invigorate him, strengthened him by pronouncing the word \"Iao.\"[fn-112-P11204_3175145:58-nf] This ¦on, moreover, which was thus reduced to despondency, he calls Achamoth, (and says) that he was seized with certain regretful passions, and out of his passions gave birth to material essences.[fn-112-P11205_3175512:59-nf] For he was panic-stricken, he says, and terror-stricken, and overcome with sadness; and of these passions he conceived and bare.

For of his panic, he says, was made darkness; of his fear and ignorance, the spirits of wickedness and malignity; of his sadness and tears, the humidities of founts, the material essence of floods and sea. Christ, moreover, was sent by that First-Father who is Bythus. He, moreover, was not in the substance of our flesh; but, bringing down from heaven some spiritual body or other, passed through the Virgin Mary as water through a pipe, neither receiving nor borrowing aught thence. The resurrection of our present flesh he denies, but (maintains that) of some sister-flesh.[fn-112-P11207_3178626:61-nf] Of the Law and the prophets some parts he approves, some he disapproves; that is, he disapproves all in reprobating some.
