What more natural then, in view of the cruelty against Christians there exercised, for the expressions with which he is credited? In this case his words contain an eloquent ambiguity, which Christians would appreciate, and which may have been in our author's mind when he says-\"quousque sÂµculum stabit.\" To those who looked for the Second Advent, daily, this did not mean what the heathen might suppose.","index":"9","references":[]},{"text":"Bede's version of the speech (See Du Cange, II., 407., ) is this: \"Quandiu stabit Colyseus-stabit et Roma: Quando cadet Colysevs-cadet et Roma: Quando cadet Roma-cadet et mundus.\" ","index":"10","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"11","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"12","references":[]}]}]}
