There is absolutely nothing which makes men's minds more obdurate than the simplicity of the divine works which are visible in the act, when compared with the grandeur which is promised thereto in the effect; so that from the very fact, that with so great simplicity, without pomp, without any considerable novelty of preparation, finally, without expense, a man is dipped in water, and amid the utterance of some few words, is sprinkled, and then rises again, not much (or not at all) the cleaner, the consequent attainment of eternity[fn-114-P11479_3248171:5-nf] is esteemed the more incredible. I am a deceiver if, on the contrary, it is not from their circumstance, and preparation, and expense, that idols' solemnities or mysteries get their credit and authority built up. Oh, miserable incredulity, which quite deniest to God His own properties, simplicity and power! What then? Is it not wonderful, too, that death should be washed away by bathing?

For water is one of those things which, before all the furnishing of the world, were quiescent with God in a yet unshapen[fn-114-P11489_3250437:12-nf] state. \"In the first beginning,\" saith Scripture, \"God made the heaven and the earth. But the earth was invisible, and unorganized,[fn-114-P11490_3250584:13-nf] and darkness was over the abyss; and the Spirit of the Lord was hovering[fn-114-P11491_3250675:14-nf] over the waters.\"[fn-114-P11492_3250709:15-nf] The first thing, O man, which you have to venerate, is the age of the, waters in that their substance is ancient; the second, their dignity, in that they were the seat of the Divine Spirit, more pleasing to Him, no doubt, than all the other then existing elements. For the darkness was total thus far, shapeless, without the ornament of stars; and the abyss gloomy; and the earth unfurnished; and the heaven unwrought: water[fn-114-P11493_3251172:16-nf] alone-always a perfect, gladsome, simple material substance, pure in itself-supplied a worthy vehicle to God. What of the fact that waters were in some way the regulating powers by which the disposition of the world thenceforward was constituted by God? For the suspension of the celestial firmament in the midst He caused by \"dividing the waters; \"[fn-114-P11494_3251535:17-nf] the suspension of \"the dry land\" He accomplished by \"separating the waters.\" After the world had been hereupon set in order through its elements, when inhabitants were given it, \"the waters\" were the first to receive the precept \"to bring forth living creatures.\"[fn-114-P11495_3251821:18-nf] Water was the first to produce that which had life, that it might be no wonder in baptism if waters know how to give life.[fn-114-P11496_3251957:19-nf] For was not the work of fashioning man himself also achieved with the aid of waters? Suitable material is found in the earth, yet not apt for the purpose unless it be moist and juicy; which (earth) \"the waters,\" separated the fourth day before into their own place, temper with their remaining moisture to a clayey consistency. If, from that time onward, I go forward in recounting universally, or at more length, the evidences of the \"authority\" of this element which I can adduce to show how great is its power or its grace; how many ingenious devices, how many functions, how useful an instrumentality, it affords the world, I fear I may seem to have collected rather the praises of water than the reasons of baptism; although I should thereby teach all the more fully, that it is not to be doubted that God has made the material substance which He has disposed throughout all His products[fn-114-P11497_3252864:20-nf] and works, obey Him also in His own peculiar sacraments; that the material substance which governs terrestrial life acts as agent likewise in the celestial.","index":"29","references":[{"fn":"114","code":"P11487_3250176","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Compare the Jews' question, Matt. xxi. 23.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":21,"verses":[23]}]},{"fn":"114","code":"P11488_3250229","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Its authority.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"114","code":"P11489_3250437","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Impolita.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"114","code":"P11490_3250584","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Incomposita.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"114","code":"P11491_3250675","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Ferebatur.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"114","code":"P11492_3250709","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Gen. i. 1, 2, and comp. the LXX.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":1,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"114","code":"P11493_3251172","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Liquor.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"114","code":"P11494_3251535","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Gen. i. 6, 7, 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":1,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"114","code":"P11495_3251821","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Animas.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"114","code":"P11496_3251957","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Animare.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"114","code":"P11497_3252864","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Rebus.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter IV.-The Primeval Hovering of the Spirit of God Over the Waters Typical of Baptism. The Universal Element of Water Thus Made a Channel of Sanctification. Resemblance Between the Outward Sign and the Inward Grace.","index":6,"paragraphs":[{"text":"But it will suffice to have thus called at the outset those points in which withal is recognised that primary principle of baptism,-which was even then fore-noted by the very attitude assumed for a type of baptism,-that the Spirit of God, who hovered over (the waters) from the beginning, would continue to linger over the waters of the baptized.[fn-115-P11501_3253598:21-nf] But a holy thing, of course, hovered over a holy; or else, from that which hovered over that which was hovered over borrowed a holiness, since it is necessary that in every case an underlying material substance should catch the quality of that which overhangs it, most of all a corporeal of a spiritual, adapted (as the spiritual is) through the subtleness of its substance, both for penetrating and insinuating. Thus the nature of the waters, sanctified by the Holy One, itself conceived withal the power of sanctifying. Let no one say, \"Why then, are we, pray, baptized with the very waters which then existed in the first beginning? \"Not with those waters, of course, except in so far as the genus indeed is one, but the species very many. But what is an attribute to the genus reappears[fn-115-P11502_3254407:22-nf] likewise in the species. And accordingly it makes no difference whether a man be washed in a sea or a pool, a stream or a fount, a lake or a trough;[fn-115-P11503_3254573:23-nf] nor is there any distinction between those whom John baptized in the Jordan and those whom Peter baptized in the Tiber, unless withal the eunuch whom Philip baptized in the midst of his journeys with chance water, derived (therefrom) more or less of salvation than others.[fn-115-P11504_3254853:24-nf] All waters, therefore, in virtue of the pristine privilege of their origin, do, after invocation of God, attain the sacramental power of sanctification; for the Spirit immediately supervenes from the heavens, and rests over the waters, sanctifying them from Himself; and being thus sanctified, they imbibe at the same time the power of sanctifying. Albeit the similitude may be admitted to be suitable to the simple act; that, since we are defiled by sins, as it were by dirt, we should be washed from those stains in waters. But as sins do not show themselves in our flesh (inasmuch as no one carries on his skin the spot of idolatry, or fornication, or fraud), so persons of that kind are foul in the spirit, which is the author of the sin; for the spirit is lord, the flesh servant. Yet they each mutually share the guilt: the spirit, on the ground of command; the flesh, of subservience. Therefore, after the waters have been in a manner endued with medicinal virtue[fn-115-P11505_3255847:25-nf] through the intervention of the angel,[fn-115-P11506_3255902:26-nf] the spirit is corporeally washed in the waters, and the flesh is in the same spiritually cleansed.","index":"31","references":[{"fn":"115","code":"P11501_3253598","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Intinctorum.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"115","code":"P11502_3254407","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Rendundat.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"115","code":"P11503_3254573","folder":"ANF-03","text":".","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"115","code":"P11504_3254853","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Acts viii. 26-40.","bible_refs":[{"book":"the acts","chapter":8,"verses":[26]}]},{"fn":"115","code":"P11505_3255847","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Medicatis.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"115","code":"P11506_3255902","folder":"ANF-03","text":"See c. vi. ad init., and c. v. ad fin.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter V.-Use Made of Water by the Heathen.

The gods themselves likewise they honour by washings. Moreover, by carrying water around, and sprinkling it, they everywhere expiate[fn-115-P11512_3256726:29-nf] country-seats, houses, temples, and whole cities: at all events, at the Apollinarian and Eleusinian games they are baptized; and they presume that the effect of their doing that is their regeneration and the remission of the penalties due to their perjuries. Among the ancients, again, whoever had defiled himself with murder, was wont to go in quest of purifying waters. Therefore, if the mere nature of water, in that it is the appropriate material for washing away, leads men to flatter themselves with a belief in omens of purification, how much more truly will waters render that service through the authority of God, by whom all their nature has been constituted! If men think that water is endued with a medicinal virtue by religion, what religion is more effectual than that of the living God? Which fact being acknowledged, we recognise here also the zeal of the devil rivalling the things of God,[fn-115-P11513_3257652:30-nf] while we find him, too, practising baptism in his subjects. What similarity is there? The unclean cleanses! the ruiner sets free! the damned absolves! He will, forsooth, destroy his own work, by washing away the sins which himself inspires! These (remarks) have been set down by way of testimony against such as reject the faith; if they put no trust in the things of God, the spurious imitations of which, in the case of God's rival, they do trust in. Are there not other cases too, in which, without any sacrament, unclean spirits brood on waters, in spurious imitation of that brooding[fn-115-P11514_3258269:31-nf] of the Divine Spirit in the very beginning? Witness all shady founts, and all unfrequented brooks, and the ponds in the baths, and the conduits[fn-115-P11515_3258431:32-nf] in private houses, or the cisterns and wells which are said to have the property of \"spiriting away,\"[fn-115-P11516_3258546:33-nf] through the power, that is, of a hurtful spirit. Men whom waters have drowned[fn-115-P11517_3258637:34-nf] or affected with madness or with fear, they call nymph-caught,[fn-115-P11518_3258717:35-nf] or \"lymphatic,\" or\" hydro-phobic.\" Why have we adduced these instances? Lest any think it too hard for belief that a holy angel of God should grant his presence to waters, to temper them to man's salvation; while the evil angel holds frequent profane commerce with the selfsame element to man's ruin. If it seems a novelty for an angel to be present in waters, an example of what was to come to pass has forerun. An angel, by his intervention, was wont to stir the pool at Bethsaida.[fn-115-P11519_3259258:36-nf] They who were complaining of ill-health used to watch for him; for whoever had been the first to descend into them, after his washing, ceased to complain. This figure of corporeal healing sang of a spiritual healing, according to the rule by which things carnal are always antecedent[fn-115-P11520_3259728:37-nf] as figurative of things spiritual. And thus, when the grace of God advanced to higher degrees among men,[fn-115-P11521_3259861:38-nf] an accession of efficacy was granted to the waters and to the angel. They who[fn-115-P11522_3259960:39-nf] were wont to remedy bodily defects,[fn-115-P11523_3260034:40-nf] now heal the spirit; they who used to work temporal salvation[fn-115-P11524_3260108:41-nf] now renew eternal; they who did set free but once in the year, now save peoples in a body[fn-115-P11525_3260225:42-nf] daily, death being done away through ablution of sins. The guilt being removed, of course the penalty is removed too. Thus man will be restored for God to His \"likeness,\" who in days bygone had been conformed to \"the image\" of God; (the \"image\" is counted (to be) in his form: the \"likeness\" in his eternity: ) for he receives again that Spirit of God which he had then first received from His afflatus, but had afterward lost through sin.","index":"33","references":[{"fn":"115","code":"P11511_3256387","folder":"ANF-03","text":"i.e., as Oehler rightly explains, \"lacking the Holy Spirit's presence and virtue.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"115","code":"P11512_3256726","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Or, \"purify.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"115","code":"P11513_3257652","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Diabolus Dei Simius.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"115","code":"P11514_3258269","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Gestationem.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"115","code":"P11515_3258431","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Euripi.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"115","code":"P11516_3258546","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Rapere.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"115","code":"P11517_3258637","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Necaverunt.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"115","code":"P11518_3258717","folder":"ANF-03","text":"\"Nypholeptos,\" restored by Oehler, = numfolh/ptouj.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"115","code":"P11519_3259258","folder":"ANF-03","text":"And note Tertullian's textual testimony as to this Scripture.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"115","code":"P11520_3259728","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Compare 1 Cor. xv. 46.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":15,"verses":[46]}]},{"fn":"115","code":"P11521_3259861","folder":"ANF-03","text":"John i. 16, 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":1,"verses":[16]}]},{"fn":"115","code":"P11522_3259960","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Qui: i.e. probably \"angeli qui.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"115","code":"P11523_3260034","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Vitia.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"115","code":"P11524_3260108","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Or, \"health\"-salutem.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"115","code":"P11525_3260225","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Conservant populos.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter VI.-The Angel the Forerunner of the Holy Spirit.
