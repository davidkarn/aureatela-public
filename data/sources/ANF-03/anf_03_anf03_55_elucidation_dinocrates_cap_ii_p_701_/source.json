Arbp. Usher[fn-121-P12184_3411585:38-nf] ingeniously turns the tables upon these errorists, by quoting the Prayers for the Dead, which were used in the Early Church, but which, such as they were, not only make no mention of a Purgatory, but refute the dogma, by their uniform limitation of such prayers to the blessed dead, and to their consummation of bliss at the Last day and not before. Such a prayer seems to occur in 2 Timothy 1:18 The context (vers. 16-18, and iv. 19) strongly supports this view; Onesiphorus is spoken of as if deceased, apparently. But, as Chrysostom understands it, he was only absent (in Rome) from his household. From i. 17 we should infer that he had left Rome.[fn-121-P12185_3412368:39-nf]  ","index":"2","references":[{"fn":"121","code":"P12184_3411585","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Cap. lv.
