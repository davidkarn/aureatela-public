Now, the doctrine of Hermogenes has this[fn-81-P8171_2318572:3-nf] taint of novelty. He is, in short,[fn-81-P8172_2318686:4-nf] a man living in the world at the present time; by his very nature a heretic, and turbulent withal, who mistakes loquacity for eloquence, and supposes impudence to be firmness, and judges it to be the duty of a good conscience to speak ill of individuals.[fn-81-P8173_2318953:5-nf] Moreover, he despises God's law in his painting,[fn-81-P8174_2319024:6-nf] maintaining repeated marriages,[fn-81-P8175_2319113:7-nf] alleges the law of God in defence of lust,[fn-81-P8176_2319394:8-nf] and yet despises it in respect of his art.[fn-81-P8177_2319498:9-nf] He falsifies by a twofold process-with his cautery and his pen.[fn-81-P8178_2319643:10-nf] He is a thorough adulterer, both doctrinally and carnally, since he is rank indeed with the contagion of your marriage-hacks,[fn-81-P8179_2320206:11-nf] and has also failed in cleaving to the rule of faith as much as the apostle's own Hermogenes.[fn-81-P8180_2320414:12-nf] However, never mind the man, when it is his doctrine which I question. He does not appear to acknowledge any other Christ as Lord,[fn-81-P8181_2320564:13-nf] though he holds Him in a different way; but by this difference in his faith he really makes Him another being,-nay, he takes from Him everything which is God, since he will not have it that He made all things of nothing. For, turning away from Christians to the philosophers, from the Church to the Academy and the Porch, he learned there from the Stoics how to place Matter (on the same level) with the Lord, just as if it too had existed ever both unborn and unmade, having no beginning at all nor end, out of which, according to him,[fn-81-P8182_2321135:14-nf] the Lord afterwards created all things.","index":"51","references":[{"fn":"81","code":"P8169_2317805","folder":"ANF-03","text":"The reference here to the De Proescript. forbids us to date this tract earlier than 207 a.d.

He could not have made all things, he says, of Himself; because whatever things the Lord made of Himself would have been parts of Himself; but[fn-81-P8187_2322041:16-nf] He is not dissoluble into parts,[fn-81-P8188_2322086:17-nf] , because, being the Lord, He is indivisible, and unchangeable, and always the same. Besides, if He had made anything out of Himself, it would have been something of Himself. Everything, however, both which was made and which He made must be accounted imperfect, because it was made of a part, and He made it of a part; or if, again, it was a whole which He made, who is a whole Himself, He must in that case have been at once both a whole, and yet not a whole; because it behaved Him to be a whole, that He might produce Himself,[fn-81-P8189_2322646:18-nf] and yet not a whole, that He might be produced out of Himself.[fn-81-P8190_2322737:19-nf] But this is a most difficult position. For if He were in existence, He could not be made, for He was in existence already; if, however, he were not in existence He could not make, because He was a nonentity. He maintains, moreover, that He who always exists, does not come into existence,[fn-81-P8191_2323055:20-nf] but exists for ever and ever. He accordingly concludes that He made nothing out of Himself, since He never passed into such a condition[fn-81-P8192_2323207:21-nf] as made it possible for Him to make anything out of Himself. In like manner, he contends that He could not have made all things out of nothing-thus: He defines the Lord as a being who is good, nay, very good, who must will to make things as good and excellent as He is Himself; indeed it were impossible for Him either to will or to make anything which was not good, nay, very good itself. Therefore all things ought to have been made good and excellent by Him, after His own condition. Experience shows,[fn-81-P8193_2323746:22-nf] however, that things which are even evil were made by Him: not, of course, of His own will and pleasure; because, if it had been of His own will and pleasure, He would be sure to have made nothing unfitting or unworthy of Himself. That, therefore, which He made not of His own will must be understood to have been made from the fault of something, and that is from Matter, without a doubt.","index":"53","references":[{"fn":"81","code":"P8186_2321531","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Praestruens.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"81","code":"P8187_2322041","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Porro.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"81","code":"P8188_2322086","folder":"ANF-03","text":"In partes non devenire.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"81","code":"P8189_2322646","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Ut faceret semetipsum.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"81","code":"P8190_2322737","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Ut fieret de semetipso.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"81","code":"P8191_2323055","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Non fieri.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"81","code":"P8192_2323207","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Non ejus fieret conditionis.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"81","code":"P8193_2323746","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Inveniri.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter III.-An Argument of Hermogenes.

An Inconsistency in the Argument of Hermogenes Pointed Out.","index":5,"paragraphs":[{"text":"He adds also another point: that as God was always God, there was never a time when God was not also Lord. But[fn-81-P8197_2324509:23-nf] it was in no way possible for Him to be regarded as always Lord, in the same manner as He had been always God, if there had not been always, in the previous eternity,[fn-81-P8198_2324688:24-nf] a something of which He could be regarded as evermore the Lord. So he concludes[fn-81-P8199_2324780:25-nf] that God always had Matter co-existent with Himself as the Lord thereof. Now, this tissue[fn-82-P8200_2324883:26-nf] of his I shall at once hasten to pull abroad. I have been willing to set it out in form to this length, for the information of those who are unacquainted with the subject, that they may know that his other arguments likewise need only be[fn-82-P8201_2325139:27-nf] understood to be refuted. We affirm, then, that the name of God always existed with Himself and in Himself-but not eternally so the Lord. Because the condition of the one is not the same as that of the other. God is the designation of the substance itself, that is, of the Divinity; but Lord is (the name) not of substance, but of power. I maintain that the substance existed always with its own name, which is God; the title Lord was afterwards added, as the indication indeed[fn-82-P8202_2325632:28-nf] of something accruing. For from the moment when those things began to exist, over which the power of a Lord was to act, God, by the accession of that power, both became Lord and received the name thereof. Because God is in like manner a Father, and He is also a Judge; but He has not always been Father and Judge, merely on the ground of His having always been God. For He could not have been the Father previous to the Son, nor a Judge previous to sin. There was, however, a time when neither sin existed with Him, nor the Son; the former of which was to constitute the Lord a Judge, and the latter a Father. In this way He was not Lord previous to those things of which He was to be the Lord. But He was only to become Lord at some future time: just as He became the Father by the Son, and a Judge by sin, so also did He become Lord by means of those things which He had made, in order that they might serve Him. Do I seem to you to be weaving arguments,[fn-82-P8203_2326604:29-nf] Hermogenes? how neatly does Scripture lend us its aid,[fn-82-P8204_2326703:30-nf] when it applies the two titles to Him with a distinction, and reveals them each at its proper time! For (the title ) God, indeed, which always belonged to Him, it names at the very first: \"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth; \"[fn-82-P8205_2326983:31-nf] and as long as He continued making, one after the other, those things of which He was to be the Lord, it merely mentions God. \"And God said,\" \"and God made,\" \"and God saw; \"[fn-82-P8206_2327173:32-nf] but nowhere do we yet find the Lord. But when He completed the whole creation, and especially man himself, who was destined to understand His sovereignty in a way of special propriety, He then is designated[fn-82-P8207_2327401:33-nf] Lord. Then also the Scripture added the name Lord: \"And the Lord God, Deus Dominus, took the man, whom He had formed; \"[fn-82-P8208_2327579:34-nf] \"And the Lord God commanded Adam.\"[fn-82-P8209_2327632:35-nf] Thenceforth He, who was previously God only, is the Lord, from the time of His having something of which He might be the Lord. For to Himself He was always God, but to all things was He only then God, when He became also Lord. Therefore, in as far as (Hermogenes) shall suppose that Matter was eternal, on the ground that the Lord was eternal, in so far will it be evident that nothing existed, because it is plain that the Lord as such did not always exist. Now I mean also, on my own part,[fn-82-P8210_2328142:36-nf] to add a remark for the sake of ignorant persons, of whom Hermogenes is an extreme instance,[fn-82-P8211_2328248:37-nf] and actually to retort against him his own arguments.[fn-82-P8212_2328465:38-nf] For when he denies that Matter was born or made, I find that, even on these terms, the title Lord is unsuitable to God in respect of Matter, because it must have been free,[fn-82-P8213_2328656:39-nf] when by not having a beginning it had not an author. The fact of its past existence it owed to no one, so that it could be a subject to no one. Therefore ever since God exercised His power over it, by creating (all things) out of Matter, although it had all along experienced God as its Lord, yet Matter does, after all, demonstrate that God did not exist in the relation of Lord to it,[fn-82-P8214_2329111:40-nf] although all the while He was really so.[fn-82-P8215_2329270:41-nf] ","index":"55","references":[{"fn":"81","code":"P8197_2324509","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Porro.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"81","code":"P8198_2324688","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Retro.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"81","code":"P8199_2324780","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Itaque.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"82","code":"P8200_2324883","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Conjecturam.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"82","code":"P8201_2325139","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Tam...quam.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"82","code":"P8202_2325632","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Scilicet.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"82","code":"P8203_2326604","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Argumentari: in the sense of argutari.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"82","code":"P8204_2326703","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Naviter nobis patrocinatur.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"82","code":"P8205_2326983","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Gen. i. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":1,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"82","code":"P8206_2327173","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Gen. i. 3, etc.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":1,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"82","code":"P8207_2327401","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Cognominatur: as if by way of surname, Deus Dominus.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"82","code":"P8208_2327579","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Gen. ii. 15.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":2,"verses":[15]}]},{"fn":"82","code":"P8209_2327632","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Gen. ii. 16.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":2,"verses":[16]}]},{"fn":"82","code":"P8210_2328142","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Et ego.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"82","code":"P8211_2328248","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Extrema linea.

For what other estimate[fn-82-P8220_2329769:43-nf] of God is there than eternity? What other condition has eternity than to have ever existed, and to exist yet for evermore by virtue of its privilege of having neither beginning nor end? Now, since this is the property of God, it will belong to God alone, whose property it is-of course[fn-82-P8221_2330068:44-nf] on this ground, that if it can be ascribed to any other being, it will no longer be the property of God, but will belong, along with Him, to that being also to which it is ascribed.

What will be principal, if that is not which is above all things, before all things, and from which all things proceed? By possessing these He is God alone, and by His sole possession of them He is One. If another also shared in the possession, there would then be as many gods as there were possessors of these attributes of God. Hermogenes, therefore, introduces two gods: he introduces Matter as God's equal. God, however, must be One, because that is God which is supreme; but nothing else can be supreme than that which is unique; and that cannot possibly be unique which has anything equal to it; and Matter will be equal with God when it is held to be[fn-82-P8226_2331607:49-nf] eternal.","index":"57","references":[{"fn":"82","code":"P8219_2329566","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Quod, with the subjunctive comparet.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"82","code":"P8220_2329769","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Census.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"82","code":"P8221_2330068","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Sculicet.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"82","code":"P8222_2330420","folder":"ANF-03","text":"1 Cor. viii. 5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":8,"verses":[5]}]},{"fn":"82","code":"P8223_2330485","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Apud nos.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"82","code":"P8224_2330527","folder":"ANF-03","text":"The property of being eternal.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"82","code":"P8225_2330805","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Unicum sit necesse est.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"82","code":"P8226_2331607","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Censetur.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter V.-Hermogenes Coquets with His Own Argument, as If Rather Afraid of It.

For, just as all things which are born, or which come to an end, and are therefore not eternal, do, by reason of their exposure at once to an end and a beginning, admit of qualities which are repugnant to God-I mean diminution and inferiority, because they are born and made-so likewise God, for this very reason, is unsusceptible of these accidents, because He is absolutely unborn,[fn-82-P8252_2338114:66-nf] and also unmade.

But being undoubtedly good, only not the Lord withal, He, by using such power[fn-82-P8276_2343280:84-nf] as He possessed, showed the necessity He was under of yielding to the condition of Matter, which He would have amended if He had been its Lord. Now this is the answer which must be given to Hermogenes when he maintains that it was by virtue of His Lordship that God used Matter-even of His non-possession of any right to it, on the ground, of course, of His not having Himself made it. Evil then, on your terms,[fn-82-P8277_2343719:85-nf] must proceed from God Himself, since He is-I will not say the Author of evil, because He did not form it, but-the permitter thereof, as having dominion over it.[fn-82-P8278_2343952:86-nf] If indeed Matter shall prove not even to belong to God at all, as being evil, it follows,[fn-82-P8279_2344063:87-nf] that when He made use of what belonged to another, He used it either on a precarious title[fn-82-P8280_2344165:88-nf] because He was in need of it, or else by violent possession because He was stronger than it.

Now, as lordship is out of the question, Hermogenes must choose which (of the other methods) is suitable to God. Did He, then, make all things out of Matter, by permission, or by force?

Great, in all conscience,[fn-82-P8287_2345710:92-nf] must be the blindness of our heretics which leaves them to argue in such a way that they either insist on the belief of another God supremely good, on the ground of their thinking the Creator to be the author of evil, or else they set up Matter with the Creator, in order that they may derive evil from Matter, not from the Creator. And yet there is absolutely no god at all that is free from such a doubtful plight, so as to be able to avoid the appearance even of being the author of evil, whosoever he is that-I will not say, indeed, has made, but still-has permitted evil to be made by some author or other, and from some source or other.

Which, then, is the worthier thought, that He created evil things of necessity, or of His own accord? Because it was indeed of necessity that He created them, if out of Matter; of His own accord, if out of nothing. For you are now labouring in vain when you try to avoid making God the Author of evil things; because, since He made all things of Matter, they will have to be ascribed to Himself, who made them, just because[fn-83-P8347_2357170:140-nf] He made them. Plainly the interest of the question, whence He made all things, identifies itself with (the question), whether He made all things out of nothing; and it matters not whence He made all things, so that He made all things thence, whence most glory accrued to Him.[fn-83-P8348_2357471:141-nf] Now, more glory accrued to Him from a creation of His own will than from one of necessity; in other words, from a creation out of nothing, than from one out of Matter. It is more worthy to believe that God is free, even as the Author of evil, than that He is a slave. Power, whatever it be, is more suited to Him than infirmity.[fn-83-P8349_2357975:142-nf] If we thus even admit that matter had nothing good in it, but that the Lord produced whatever good He did produce of His own power, then some other questions will with equal reason arise. First, since there was no good at all in Matter, it is clear that good was not made of Matter, on the express ground indeed that Matter did not possess it. Next, if good was not made of Matter, it must then have been made of God; if not of God, then it must have been made of nothing.-For this is the alternative, on Hermogenes' own showing.[fn-83-P8350_2358524:143-nf] ","index":"77","references":[{"fn":"83","code":"P8343_2356224","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Nactus.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"83","code":"P8344_2356314","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Turpe.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"83","code":"P8345_2356449","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Utique.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"83","code":"P8346_2356599","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Ex malo.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"83","code":"P8347_2357170","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Proinde quatenus.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"83","code":"P8348_2357471","folder":"ANF-03","text":"We subjoin the original of thes sentence: \"Plane sic interest unde fecerit ac si de nihilo fecisset, nec interest uned fecerit, ut inde fecerit unde eum magis decuit.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"83","code":"P8349_2357975","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Pusillitas.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"83","code":"P8350_2358524","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Secundum Hermogenis dispositionem.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter XV.-The Truth, that God Made All Things from Nothing, Rescued from the Opponent's Flounderings.","index":17,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Now, if good was neither produced out of matter, since it was not in it, evil as it was, nor out of God, since, according to the position of Hermogenes, nothing could have been produced out of god, it will be found that good was created out of nothing, inasmuch as it was formed of none-neither of Matter nor of God. And if good was formed out of nothing, why not evil too? Nay, if anything was formed out of nothing, why not all things? Unless indeed it be that the divine might was insufficient for the production of all things, though it produced a something out of nothing. Or else if good proceeded from evil matter, since it issued neither from nothing nor from God, it will follow that it must have proceeded from the conversion of Matter contrary to that unchangeable attribute which has been claimed for it, as an eternal being.[fn-83-P8354_2359507:144-nf] Thus, in regard to the source whence good derived its existence, Hermogenes will now have to deny the possibility of such. But still it is necessary that (good) should proceed from some one of those sources from which he has denied the very possibility of its having been derived. Now if evil be denied to be of nothing for the purpose of denying it to be the work of God, from whose will there would be too much appearance of its being derived, and be alleged to proceed from Matter, that it may be the property of that very thing of whose substance it is assumed to be made, even here also, as I have said, God will have to be regarded as the Author of evil; because, whereas it had been His duty[fn-83-P8355_2360581:145-nf] to produce all good things out of Matter, or rather good things simply, by His identical attribute of power and will, He did yet not only not produce all good things, but even (some) evil things-of course, either willing that the evil should exist if He was able to cause their non-existence, or not being strong enough to effect that all things should be good, if being desirous of that result, He failed in the accomplishment thereof; since there can be no difference whether it were by weakness or by will, that the Lord proved to be the Author of evil. Else what was the reason that, after creating good things, as if Himself good, He should have also produced evil things, as if He failed in His goodness, since He did not confine Himself to the production of things which were simply consistent with Himself? What necessity was there, after the production of His proper work, for His troubling Himself about Matter also by producing evil likewise, in order to secure His being alone acknowledged as good from His good, and at the same time[fn-83-P8356_2361656:146-nf] to prevent Matter being regarded as evil from (created) evil? Good would have flourished much better if evil had not blown upon it. For Hermogenes himself explodes the arguments of sundry persons who contend that evil things were necessary to impart lustre to the good, which must be understood from their contrasts. This, therefore, was not the ground for the production of evil; but if some other reason must be sought for the introduction thereof, why could it not have been introduced even from nothing,[fn-83-P8357_2362288:147-nf] since the very same reason would exculpate the Lord from the reproach of being thought the author of evil, which now excuses the existence of evil things, when He produces them out of Matter? And if there is this excuse, then the question is completely[fn-83-P8358_2362586:148-nf] shut up in a corner, where they are unwilling to find it, who, without examining into the reason itself of evil, or distinguishing how they should either attribute it to God or separate it from God, do in fact expose God to many most unworthy calumnies.[fn-83-P8359_2362866:149-nf] ","index":"79","references":[{"fn":"83","code":"P8354_2359507","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Contra denegatam aeterni conversationem.

Now if both should prove to belong to God, God evidently will be the author of evil; but God, as being good, cannot be the author of evil. Again, if both are ascribed to Matter, Matter will evidently be the very mother of good,[fn-83-P8367_2363995:154-nf] but inasmuch as Matter is wholly evil, it cannot be the mother of good. But if both one and the other should be thought to belong to Both together, then in this case also Matter will be comparable with God; and both will be equal, being on equal terms allied to evil as well as to good. Matter, however, ought not to be compared with God, in order that it may not make two gods. If, (lastly, ) one be ascribed to One, and the other to the Other-that is to say, let the good be God's, and the evil belong to Matter-then, on the one hand, evil must not be ascribed to God, nor, on the other hand, good to Matter. And God, moreover, by making both good things and evil things out of Matter, creates them along with it. This being the case, I cannot tell how Hermogenes[fn-83-P8368_2364781:155-nf] is to escape from my conclusion; for he supposes that God cannot be the author of evil, in what way soever He created evil out of Matter, whether it was of His own will, or of necessity, or from the reason (of the case). If, however, He is the author of evil, who was the actual Creator, Matter being simply associated with Him by reason of its furnishing Him with substance,[fn-83-P8369_2365369:156-nf] you now do away with the cause[fn-83-P8370_2365434:157-nf] of your introducing Matter. For it is not the less true, that it is by means of Matter that God shows Himself the author of evil, although Matter has been assumed by you expressly to prevent God's seeming to be the author of evil. Matter being therefore excluded, since the cause of it is excluded, it remains that God without doubt, must have made all things out of nothing. Whether evil things were amongst them we shall see, when it shall be made clear what are evil things, and whether those things are evil which you at present deem to be so. For it is more worthy of God that He produced even these of His own will, by producing them out of nothing, than from the predetermination of another,[fn-83-P8371_2366343:158-nf] (which must have been the case) if He had produced them out of Matter.

Not to say that[fn-84-P8401_2371723:182-nf] what is unbegotten is stronger than that which is born, and what is not made more powerful than that which is made.

They have found their opportunity, as is usual with heretics, in wresting the plain meaning of certain words. For instance the very beginning,[fn-84-P8411_2373464:189-nf] when God made the heaven and the earth, they will construe as if it meant something substantial and embodied,[fn-84-P8412_2373593:190-nf] to be regarded as Matter. We, however, insist on the proper signification of every word, and say that principium means beginning,-being a term which is suitable to represent things which begin to exist. For nothing which has come into being is without a beginning, nor can this its commencement be at any other moment than when it begins to have existence. Thus principium or beginning, is simply a term of inception, not the name of a substance. Now, inasmuch as the heaven and the earth are the principal works of God, and since, by His making them first, He constituted them in an especial manner the beginning of His creation, before all things else, with good reason does the Scripture preface (its record of creation) with the words,\" In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth; \"[fn-84-P8413_2374408:191-nf] just as it would have said, \"At last God made the heaven and the earth,\" if God had created these after all the rest. Now, if the beginning is a substance, the end must also be material. No doubt, a substantial thing[fn-84-P8414_2374643:192-nf] may be the beginning of some other thing which may be formed out of it thus the clay is the beginning of the vessel. and the seed is the beginning of the plant. But when we employ the word beginning in this sense of origin, and not in that of order, we do not omit to mention also the name of that particular thing which we regard as the origin of the other. On the other hand,[fn-84-P8415_2375050:193-nf] if we were to make such a statement as this, for example, \"In the beginning the potter made a basin or a water-jug,\" the word beginning will not here indicate a material substance (for I have not mentioned the clay, which is the beginning in this sense, but only the order of the work, meaning that the potter made the basin and the jug first, before anything else-intending afterwards to make the rest. It is, then, to the order of the works that the word beginning has reference, not to the origin of their substances. I might also explain this word beginning in another way, which would not, however, be inapposite.[fn-84-P8416_2375687:194-nf] The Greek term for beginning, which is a0rkh/, admits the sense not only of priority of order, but of power as well; whence princes and magistrates are called a0rkontej.Therefore in this sense too, beginning may be taken for princely authority and power. It was, indeed, in His transcendent authority and power, that God made the heaven and the earth.","index":"87","references":[{"fn":"84","code":"P8410_2373001","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Originale instrumentum: which may mean \"the document which treats of the origin of all things.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"84","code":"P8411_2373464","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Principium.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"84","code":"P8412_2373593","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Corpulentum.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"84","code":"P8413_2374408","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Gen. i. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":1,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"84","code":"P8414_2374643","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Substantivum aliquid.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"84","code":"P8415_2375050","folder":"ANF-03","text":"De cetero.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"84","code":"P8416_2375687","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Non ab re tamen.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter XX.-Meaning of the Phrase-In the Beginning.

If, indeed, beginning had a material signification, the Scripture would not have informed us that God made so and so in principio, at the beginning, but rather ex principio, of the beginning; for He would not have created in, but of, matter. When Wisdom, however, was referred to, it was quite right to say, in the beginning. For it was in Wisdom that He made all things at first, because by meditating and arranging His plans therein,[fn-84-P8423_2377222:198-nf] He had in fact already done (the work of creation); and if He had even intended to create out of matter, He would yet have effected His creation when He previously meditated on it and arranged it in His Wisdom, since It[fn-84-P8424_2377469:199-nf] was in fact the beginning of His ways: this meditation and arrangement being the primal operation of Wisdom, opening as it does the way to the works by the act of meditation and thought.[fn-84-P8425_2377671:200-nf] This authority of Scripture I claim for myself even from this circumstance, that whilst it shows me the God who created, and the works He created, it does not in like manner reveal to me the source from which He created. For since in every operation there are three principal things, He who makes, and that which is made, and that of which it is made, there must be three names mentioned in a correct narrative of the operation-the person of the maker the sort of thing which is made,[fn-84-P8426_2378176:201-nf] and the material of which it is formed. If the material is not mentioned, while the work and the maker of the work are both mentioned, it is manifest that He made the work out of nothing.For if He had had anything to operate upon, it would have been mentioned as well as (the other two particulars).[fn-84-P8427_2378498:202-nf] In conclusion, I will apply the Gospel as a supplementary testimony to the Old Testament. Now in this there is all the greater reason why there should be shown the material (if there were any) out of which God made all things, inasmuch as it is therein plainly revealed by whom He made all things. \"In the beginning was the Word\"[fn-84-P8428_2378844:203-nf] -that is, the same beginning, of course, in which God made the heaven and the earth[fn-84-P8429_2378946:204-nf] -\"and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. All things were made by Him, and without Him nothing was made.\"[fn-84-P8430_2379079:205-nf] Now, since we have here clearly told us who the Maker was, that is, God, and what He made, even all things, and through whom He made them, even His Word, would not the order of the narrative have required that the source out of which all things were made by God through the Word should likewise be declared, if they had been in fact made out of anything? What, therefore, did not exist, the Scripture was unable to mention; and by not mentioning it, it has given us a clear proof that there was no such thing: for if there had been, the Scripture would have mentioned it.","index":"89","references":[{"fn":"84","code":"P8420_2376399","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Illam...quae.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"84","code":"P8421_2376485","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Condidit: \"created.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"84","code":"P8422_2376575","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Prov. viii. 22.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","chapter":8,"verses":[22]}]},{"fn":"84","code":"P8423_2377222","folder":"ANF-03","text":"In qua: in Wisdom.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"84","code":"P8424_2377469","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Wisdom.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"84","code":"P8425_2377671","folder":"ANF-03","text":"De cogitatu.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"84","code":"P8426_2378176","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Species facti.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"84","code":"P8427_2378498","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Proinde.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"84","code":"P8428_2378844","folder":"ANF-03","text":"John i. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":1,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"84","code":"P8429_2378946","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Gen. i. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":1,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"84","code":"P8430_2379079","folder":"ANF-03","text":"John i. 1-3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":1,"verses":[1]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter XXI.-A Retort of Heresy Answered.

Some arguments may, of course,[fn-84-P8434_2380206:206-nf] be thus retorted easily enough; but it does not follow that they are on that account fairly admissible, where there is a diversity in the cause. For I maintain that, even if the Scripture has not expressly declared that all things were made out of nothing-just as it abstains (from saying that they were formed)out of Matter-there was no such pressing need for expressly indicating the creation of all things out of nothing, as there was of their creation out of Matter, if that had been their origin. Because, in the case of what is made out of nothing, the very fact of its not being indicated that it was made of any particular thing shows that it was made of nothing; and there is no danger of its being supposed that it was made of anything, when there is no indication at all of what it was made of. In the case, however, of that which is made out of something, unless the very fact be plainly declared, that it was made out of something, there will be danger, until[fn-84-P8435_2381193:207-nf] it is shown of what it was made, first of its appearing to be made of nothing, because it is not said of what it was made; and then, should it be of such a nature[fn-84-P8436_2381504:208-nf] as to have the appearance of having certainly been made of something, there will be a similar risk of its seeming to have been made of afar different material from the proper one, so long as there is an absence of statement of what it was made of. Then, if God had been unable to make all things of nothing, the Scripture could not possibly have added that He had made all things of nothing: (there could have been no room for such a statement, ) but it must by all means have informed us that He had made all things out of Matter, since Matter must have been the source; because the one case was quite to be understood,[fn-84-P8437_2382147:209-nf] if it were not actually stated, whereas the other case would be left in doubt unless it were stated.","index":"91","references":[{"fn":"84","code":"P8434_2380206","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Plane.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"84","code":"P8435_2381193","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Dum ostenditur: which Oehler and Rigalt. construe as \"donec ostendatur.\" One reading has \"dum non ostenditur,\" \"so long as it is not shown.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"84","code":"P8436_2381504","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Ea conditione.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"84","code":"P8437_2382147","folder":"ANF-03","text":"In totum habebat intelligi.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter XXII.-This Conclusion Confirmed by the Usage of Holy Scripture in Its History of the Creation.

I ask, then, since Matter is not mentioned in Scripture, how the term earth can be applied to it, which marks a substance of another kind? There is all the greater need why mention should also have been made of Matter, if this has acquired the further sense of Earth, in order that I may be sure that Earth is one and the same name as Matter, and so not claim the designation for merely one substance, as the proper name thereof, and by which it is better known; or else be unable (if I should feel the inclination), to apply it to some particular species of Mater, instead, indeed,[fn-84-P8464_2388131:227-nf] of making it the common term[fn-84-P8465_2388179:228-nf] of all Matter.

This being the case, another question presents itself to us, whether it is right and proper that this earth which God made should have derived its name from that out of which He made it? For I find from Hermogenes and the rest of the Materialist heretics,[fn-84-P8474_2390132:234-nf] that while the one earth was indeed \"without form, and void,\" this one of ours obtained from God in an equal degree[fn-84-P8475_2390317:235-nf] both form, and beauty, and symmetry; and therefore that the earth which was created was a different thing from that out of which it was created. Now, having become a different thing, it could not possibly have shared with the other in its name, after it had declined from its condition. If earth was the proper name of the (original) Matter, this world of ours, which is not Matter, because it has become another thing, is unfit to bear the name of earth, seeing that that name belongs to something else, and is a stranger to its nature. But (you will tell me) Matter which has undergone creation, that is, our earth, had with its original a community of name no less than of kind. By no means. For although the pitcher is formed out of the clay, I shall no longer call it clay, but a pitcher; so likewise, although electrum[fn-84-P8476_2391158:236-nf] is compounded of gold and silver, I shall yet not call it either gold or silver, but electrum. When there is a departure from the nature of any thing, there is likewise a relinquishment of its name-with a propriety which is alike demanded by the designation and the condition. How great a change indeed from the condition of that earth, which is Matter, has come over this earth of ours, is plain even from the fact that the latter has received this testimony to its goodness in Genesis, \"And God saw that it was good; \"[fn-84-P8477_2391725:237-nf] while the former, according to Hermogenes, is regarded as the origin and cause of all evils. Lastly, if the one is Earth because the other is, why also is the one not Matter as the other is? Indeed, by this rule both the heaven and all creatures ought to have had the names of Earth and Matter, since they all consist of Matter. I have said enough touching the designation Earth, by which he will have it that Matter is understood. This, as everybody knows, is the name of one of the elements; for so we are taught by nature first, and afterwards by Scripture, except it be that credence must be given to that Silenus who talked so confidently in the presence of king Midas of another world, according to the account of Theopompus.

For to this purport does David say:[fn-85-P8531_2401159:281-nf] \"The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and all that dwell therein: He hath rounded it upon the seas, and on the streams hath He established it.\"[fn-85-P8532_2401366:282-nf] It was when the waters were withdrawn into their hollow abysses that the dry land became conspicuous,[fn-85-P8533_2401488:283-nf] which was hitherto covered with its watery envelope.

So that I must[fn-85-P8541_2402974:291-nf] see Matter, since it has become visible. I must likewise recognize it as a completed thing, so as to be able to gather from it the herb bearing seed, and the tree yielding fruit, and that living creatures, made out of it, may minister to my need. Matter, however, is nowhere,[fn-85-P8542_2403263:292-nf] but the Earth is here, confessed to my view.

His purpose was also, that He might thus prevent His having made it in vain, by rendering it visible, and so fit for use. And thus, throughout, proofs arise to us that this earth which we inhabit is the very same which was both created and formed[fn-85-P8546_2404212:296-nf] by God, and that none other was \"Without form, and void,\" than that which had been created and formed.

To this point[fn-85-P8573_2407331:317-nf] also we must give an answer. Holy I Scripture would be sufficiently explicit, if it had declared that the heaven and the earth, as the very highest works of creation, were made by God, possessing of course their own special appurtenances,[fn-85-P8574_2407609:318-nf] which might be understood to be implied in these highest works themselves. Now the appurtenances of the heaven and the earth, made then in the beginning, were the darkness and the deep, and the spirit, and the waters. For the depth and the darkness underlay the earth. Since the deep was under the earth, and the darkness was over the deep, undoubtedly both the darkness and the deep were under the earth. Below the heaven, too, lay the spirit[fn-85-P8575_2408112:319-nf] and the waters. For since the waters were over the earth, which they covered, whilst the spirit was over the waters, both the spirit and the waters were alike over the earth. Now that which is over the earth, is of course under the heaven. And even as the earth brooded over the deep and the darkness, so also did the heaven brood over the spirit and the waters, and embrace them.Nor, indeed, is there any novelty in mentioning only that which contains, as pertaining to the whole,[fn-85-P8576_2408685:320-nf] and understanding that which is contained as included in it, in its character of a portion.[fn-85-P8577_2408797:321-nf] Suppose now I should say the city built a theatre and a circus, but the stage[fn-85-P8578_2408898:322-nf] was of such and such a kind, and the statues were on the canal, and the obelisk was reared above them all, would it follow that, because I did not distinctly state that these specific things[fn-85-P8579_2409103:323-nf] were made by the city, they were therefore not made by it along with the circus and the theatre? Did I not, indeed, refrain from specially mentioning the formation of these particular things because they were implied in the things which I had already said were made, and might be understood to be inherent in the things in which they were contained? But this example may be an idle one as being derived from a human circumstance; I will take another, which has the authority of Scripture itself. It says that \"God made man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.\"[fn-85-P8580_2409754:324-nf] Now, although it here mentions the nostrils,[fn-85-P8581_2409818:325-nf] it does not say that they were made by God; so again it speaks of skin[fn-85-P8582_2409979:326-nf] and bones, and flesh and eyes, and sweat and blood, in subsequent passages,[fn-85-P8583_2410104:327-nf] and yet it never intimated that they had been created by God. What will Hermogenes have to answer? That the human limbs must belong to Matter, because they are not specially mentioned as objects of creation? Or are they included in the formation of man? In like manner, the deep and the darkness, and the spirit and the waters, were as members of the heaven and the earth. For in the bodies the limbs were made, in the bodies the limbs too were mentioned. No element but what is a member of that element in which it is contained.

It could not but know that there were those who would at once in the bodies understand their several members also, and therefore it employed this concise mode of speech. But, at the same time, it foresaw that there would be stupid and crafty men, who, after paltering with the virtual meaning,[fn-85-P8588_2411467:329-nf] would require for the several members a word descriptive of their formation too. It is therefore because of such persons, that Scripture in other passages teaches us of the creation of the individual parts. You have Wisdom saying, \"But before the depths was I brought forth,\"[fn-85-P8589_2411781:330-nf] in order that you may believe that the depths were also \"brought forth\"-that is, created-just as we create sons also, though we \"bring them forth.\" It matters not whether the depth was made or born, so that a beginning be accorded to it, which however would not be, if it were subjoined[fn-85-P8590_2412091:331-nf] to matter.

It must follow, then,[fn-86-P8605_2413956:346-nf] that as earth consisted of earth, so also depth consisted of depth, and darkness of darkness, and the wind and waters of wind and waters. And, as we said above,[fn-86-P8606_2414151:347-nf] Matter could not have been without form, since it had specific parts, which were formed out of it-although as separate things[fn-86-P8607_2414311:348-nf] -unless, indeed, they were not separate, but were the very same with those out of which they came. For it is really impossible that those specific things, which are set forth under the same names, should have been diverse; because in that case[fn-86-P8608_2414575:349-nf] the operation of God might seem to be useless,[fn-86-P8609_2414634:350-nf] if it made things which existed already; since that alone would be a creation,[fn-86-P8610_2414728:351-nf] when things came into being, which had not been (previously) made. Therefore, to conclude, either Moses then pointed to Matter when he wrote the words: \"And darkness was on the face of the deep, and the spirit of God moved on the face of the waters; \"or else, inasmuch as these specific parts of creation are afterwards shown in other passages to have been made by God, they ought to have been with equal explicitness[fn-86-P8611_2415429:352-nf] shown to have been made out of the Matter which, according to you, Moses had previously mentioned;[fn-86-P8612_2415542:353-nf] or else, finally, if Moses pointed to those specific parts, and not to Matter, I want to know where Matter has been pointed out at all.","index":"112","references":[{"fn":"85","code":"P8587_2411050","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Quatenus hic commendare videtur.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8588_2411467","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Dissimulato tacito intellectu.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8589_2411781","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Prov. viii. 24.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","chapter":8,"verses":[24]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8590_2412091","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Subjecta.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8591_2412219","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Isa. xlv. 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":45,"verses":[7]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8592_2412251","folder":"ANF-03","text":"De spiritu.

Indeed, you retract what you declared-that Matter is neither good nor evil; because you imply that it is evil when you say, \"If it were good, it would not require to be set in order by God; \"so again, when you add, \"If it were naturally evil, it would not admit of any change for the better,\" you seem to intimate[fn-86-P8676_2428002:402-nf] that it is good. And so you attribute to it a close relation[fn-86-P8677_2428083:403-nf] to good and evil, although you declared it neither good nor evil. With a view, however, to re lute the argument whereby you thought you were going to clinch your proposition, I here contend: If Matter had always been good, why should it not have still wanted a change for the better? Does that which is good never desire, never wish, never feel able to advance, so as to change its good for a better? And in like manner, if Matter had been by nature evil, why might it not have been changed by God as the more powerful Being, as able to convert the nature of stones into children of Abraham?[fn-86-P8678_2428691:404-nf] Surely by such means you not only compare the Lord with Matter, but you even put Him below[fn-86-P8679_2428803:405-nf] it, since you affirm that[fn-86-P8680_2428845:406-nf] the nature of Matter could not possibly be brought under control by Him, and trained to something better. But although you are here disinclined to allow that Matter is by nature evil, yet in another passage you will deny having made such an admission.[fn-86-P8681_2429148:407-nf] ","index":"122","references":[{"fn":"86","code":"P8674_2426821","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Compositionem Dei.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8675_2426913","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Non accepisset translationem.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8676_2428002","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Subostendis.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8677_2428083","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Affinem.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8678_2428691","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Matt. iii. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":3,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8679_2428803","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Subicis.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8680_2428845","folder":"ANF-03","text":"This is the force of the subjunctive verb.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8681_2429148","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Te confessum.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter XXXIII.-Other Speculations of Hermogenes, About Matter and Some of Its Adjuncts, Shown to Be Absurd.

Motion in Matter was disordered, and confused, and turbulent. This is why you apply to it the comparison of a boiler of hot water surging over. Now how is it, that in another passage another sort of motion is affirmed by you? For when you want to represent Matter as neither good nor evil, you say: \"Matter, which is the substratum (of creation)[fn-87-P8723_2436371:437-nf] possessing as it does motion in an equable impulse,[fn-87-P8724_2436449:438-nf] tends in no very great degree either to good or to evil.\" Now if it had this equable impulse, it could not be turbulent, nor be like the boiling water of the caldron; it would rather be even and regular, oscillating indeed of its own accord between good and evil, but yet not prone or tending to either side. It would swing, as the phrase is, in a just and exact balance. Now this is not unrest; this is not turbulence or inconstancy;[fn-87-P8725_2436915:439-nf] but rather the regularity, and evenness, and exactitude of a motion, inclining to neither side. If it oscillated this way and that way, and inclined rather to one particular side, it would plainly in that case merit the reproach of unevenness, and inequality, and turbulence. Moreover, although the motion of Matter was not prone either to good or to evil, it would still, of course, oscillate between good and evil; so that from this circumstance too it is obvious that Matter is contained within certain limits,[fn-87-P8726_2437448:440-nf] because its motion, while prone to neither good nor evil, since it had no natural bent either way, oscillated from either between both, and therefore was contained within the limits of the two.

I suppose He journeyed to it from a long distance, as soon as He washed to appear and approach to it.","index":"137","references":[{"fn":"87","code":"P8757_2443069","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Facit quid decor.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"87","code":"P8758_2443519","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Certe.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"87","code":"P8759_2443715","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Retro.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"87","code":"P8760_2444132","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Dan. iii. 21.","bible_refs":[{"book":"daniel","chapter":3,"verses":[21]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter XLV.-Conclusion. Contrast Between the Statements of Hermogenes and the Testimony of Holy Scripture Respecting the Creation. Creation Out of Nothing, Not Out of Matter.","index":46,"paragraphs":[{"text":"But it is not thus that the prophets and the apostles have told us that the world was made by God merely appearing and approaching Matter. They did not even mention any Matter, but (said) that Wisdom was first set up, the beginning of His ways, for His works.[fn-87-P8764_2444843:465-nf] Then that the Word was produced, \"through whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made.\"[fn-87-P8765_2444975:466-nf] Indeed, \"by the Word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all their hosts by the breath of His mouth.\"[fn-87-P8766_2445098:467-nf] He is the Lord's right hand,[fn-87-P8767_2445186:468-nf] indeed His two bands, by which He worked and constructed the universe. \"For,\" says He, \"the heavens are the works of Thine hands,\"[fn-87-P8768_2445341:469-nf] wherewith \"He hath meted out the heaven, and the earth with a span.\"[fn-87-P8769_2445430:470-nf] Do not be willing so to cover God with flattery, as to contend that He produced by His mere appearance and simple approach so many vast substances, instead of rather forming them by His own energies. For this is proved by Jeremiah when he says, \"God hath made the earth by His power, He hath established the world by His wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by His understanding.\"[fn-87-P8770_2445851:471-nf] These are the energies by the stress of which He made this universe.[fn-87-P8771_2445940:472-nf] His glory is greater if He laboured. At length on the seventh day He rested from His works. Both one and the other were after His manner. If, on the contrary,[fn-87-P8772_2446119:473-nf] He made this world simply by appearing and approaching it, did He, on the completion of His work, cease to appear and approach it any more. Nay rather,[fn-87-P8773_2446286:474-nf] God began to appear more conspicuously and to be everywhere accessible[fn-87-P8774_2446372:475-nf] from the time when the world was made. You see, therefore, how all things consist by the operation of that God who \"made the earth by His power, who established the world by His wisdom, and stretched out the heaven by His understanding; \"not appearing merely, nor approaching, but applying the almighty efforts of His mind, His wisdom, His power, His understanding, His word, His Spirit, His might. Now these things were not necessary to Him, if He had been perfect by simply appearing and approaching. They are, however, His \"invisible things,\" which, according to the apostle, \"are from the creation of the world clearly seen by the things that are made;[fn-87-P8775_2447054:476-nf] they are no parts of a nondescript[fn-87-P8776_2447108:477-nf] Matter, but they are the sensible[fn-87-P8777_2447162:478-nf] evidences of Himself. \"For who hath known the mind of the Lord,\"[fn-87-P8778_2447245:479-nf] of which (the apostle) exclaims: \"O the depth of the riches both of His wisdom and knowledge! how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out! \"[fn-87-P8779_2447428:480-nf] Now what clearer truth do these words indicate, than that all things were made out of nothing? They are incapable of being found out or investigated, except by God alone. Otherwise, if they were traceable or discoverable in Matter, they would be capable of investigation. Therefore, in as far as it has become evident that Matter had no prior existence (even from this circumstance, that it is impossible[fn-87-P8780_2447849:481-nf] for it to have had such an existence as is assigned to it), in so far is it proved that all things were made by God out of nothing. It must be admitted, however,[fn-87-P8781_2448032:482-nf] that Hermogenes, by describing for Matter a condition like his own-irregular, confused, turbulent, of a doubtful and precipate and fervid impulse-has displayed a specimen of his own art, and painted his own portrait.
