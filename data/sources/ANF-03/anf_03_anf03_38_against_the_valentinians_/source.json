The officiousness with which they guard their doctrine is an officiousness which betrays their guilt.[fn-87-P8793_2449340:2-nf] Their disgrace is proclaimed in the very earnestness with which they maintain their religious system. Now, in the case of those Eleusinian mysteries, which are the very heresy of Athenian superstition, it is their secrecy that is their disgrace. Accordingly, they previously beset all access to their body with tormenting conditions;[fn-87-P8794_2449957:3-nf] and they require a long initiation before they enrol (their members),[fn-87-P8795_2450056:4-nf] even instruction during five years for their perfect disciples,[fn-87-P8796_2450144:5-nf] in order that they may mould[fn-87-P8797_2450213:6-nf] their opinions by this suspension of full knowledge, and apparently raise the dignity of their mysteries in proportion to the craving for them which they have previously created. Then follows the duty of silence. Carefully is that guarded, which is so long in finding. All the divinity, however, lies in their secret recesses:[fn-87-P8798_2450555:7-nf] there are revealed at last all the aspirations of the fully initiated,[fn-87-P8799_2450637:8-nf] the entire mystery of the sealed tongue, the symbol of virility. But this allegorical representation,[fn-88-P8800_2450753:9-nf] under the pretext of nature's reverend name, obscures a real sacrilege by help of an arbitrary symbol,[fn-88-P8801_2450872:10-nf] and by empty images obviates[fn-88-P8802_2450934:11-nf] the reproach of falsehood![fn-88-P8803_2450975:12-nf] In like manner, the heretics who are now the object of our remarks,[fn-88-P8804_2451105:13-nf] the Valentinians, have formed Eleusinian dissipations[fn-88-P8805_2451186:14-nf] of their own, consecrated by a profound silence, having nothing of the heavenly in them but their mystery.[fn-88-P8806_2451309:15-nf] By the help of the sacred names and titles and arguments of true religion, they have fabricated the vainest and foulest figment for men's pliant liking,[fn-88-P8807_2451482:16-nf] out of the affluent suggestions of Holy Scripture, since from its many springs many errors may well emanate. If you propose to them inquiries sincere and honest, they answer you with stern[fn-88-P8808_2451836:17-nf] look and contracted brow, and say, \"The subject is profound.\" If you try them with subtle questions, with the ambiguities of their double tongue, they affirm a community of faith (with yourself). If you intimate to them that you understand their opinions, they insist on knowing nothing themselves. If you come to a close engagement with them they destroy your own fond hope of a victory over them by a self-immolation.[fn-88-P8809_2452272:18-nf] Not even to their own disciples do they commit a secret before they have made sure of them.

Most perverse, however, are they who are not simple, even as they are most foolish who are not wise. And yet, (if I must choose) I should prefer taking[fn-88-P8815_2453231:21-nf] the latter condition for the lesser fault; since it is perhaps better to have a wisdom which falls short in quantity, than that which is bad in quality[fn-88-P8816_2453472:22-nf] -better to be in error than to mislead. Besides, the face of the Lord[fn-88-P8817_2453599:23-nf] is patiently waited for by those who \"seek Him in simplicity of heart,\" as says the very Wisdom-not of Valentinus, but-of Solomon.[fn-88-P8818_2453747:24-nf] Then, again, infants have borne[fn-88-P8819_2453804:25-nf] by their blood a testimony to Christ.

In brief, \"the dove\" has usually served to figure Christ; \"the serpent,\" to tempt Him. The one even from the first has been the harbinger of divine peace; the other from the beginning has been the despoiler of the divine image. Accordingly, simplicity alone[fn-88-P8824_2454825:30-nf] will be more easily able to know and to declare God, whereas wisdom alone will rather do Him violence,[fn-88-P8825_2454955:31-nf] and betray Him.","index":"47","references":[{"fn":"88","code":"P8813_2452686","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Notamur.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"88","code":"P8814_2452924","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Matt. x. 16.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":10,"verses":[16]}]},{"fn":"88","code":"P8815_2453231","folder":"ANF-03","text":"In the original the phrase is put passively: \"malim eam partem meliori sumi vitio.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"88","code":"P8816_2453472","folder":"ANF-03","text":"How terse is the original! minus sapere quam pejus.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"88","code":"P8817_2453599","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Facies Dei.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"88","code":"P8818_2453747","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Wisd. of Sol. i. 1.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"88","code":"P8819_2453804","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Litaverunt: \"consecrated.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"88","code":"P8820_2453938","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Tertullian's words are rather suggestive of sense than of syntax: \"Pueros vocem qui crucem clamant?\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"88","code":"P8821_2454188","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Secundum Deum: \"according to God's will.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"88","code":"P8822_2454338","folder":"ANF-03","text":"1 Cor. xiv. 20, where Tertullian renders the tai=j fresi/ (A.V. \"understanding\") by \"sensibus.\"","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":14,"verses":[20]}]},{"fn":"88","code":"P8823_2454525","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Dedi.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"88","code":"P8824_2454825","folder":"ANF-03","text":"i.e., without wisdom.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"88","code":"P8825_2454955","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Concutere.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter III.-The Folly of This Heresy.

Valentinus had expected to become a bishop, because he was an able man both in genius and eloquence. Being indignant, however, that another obtained the dignity by reason of a claim which confessorship[fn-88-P8848_2459692:48-nf] had given him, he broke with the church of the true faith. Just like those (restless) spirits which, when roused by ambition, are usually inflamed with the desire of revenge, he applied himself with all his might[fn-88-P8849_2459920:49-nf] to exterminate the truth; and finding the clue[fn-88-P8850_2459983:50-nf] of a certain old opinion, he marked out a path for himself with the subtlety of a serpent. Ptolemµus afterwards entered on the same path, by distinguishing the names and the numbers of the ¦nons into personal substances, which, however, he kept apart from God. Valentinus had included these in the very essence of the Deity, as senses and affections of motion. Sundry bypaths were then struck off therefrom, by Heraclean and Secundus and the magician Marcus. Theotimus worked hard about \"the images of the law.\" Valentinus, however, was as yet nowhere, and still the Valentinians derive their name from Valentinus.

Even our Creator has had arranged for Him the saloons of Ennius in the fashion of private rooms,[fn-88-P8882_2466596:73-nf] with chamber piled upon chamber, and assigned to each god by just as many staircases as there were heresies.

There the god even of the Valentinians has his dwelling in the attics. They call him indeed, as to his essence, Ai0w=n te/leoj (Perfect ¦on), but in respect of his personality, Proarxh/ (Before the Beginning),  9H'Arkh/ (The Beginning), and sometimes Bythos (Depth),[fn-88-P8885_2467475:76-nf] a name which is most unfit for one who dwells in the heights above! They describe him as unbegotten, immense, infinite, invisible, and eternal; as if, when they described him to be such as we know that he ought to be, they straightway prove him to be a being who may be said to have had such an existence even before all things else. I indeed insist upon[fn-88-P8886_2467977:77-nf] it that he is such a being; and there is nothing which I detect in beings of this sort more obvious, than that they who are said to have been before all things-things, too, not their own-are found to be behind all things. Let it, however, be granted that this Bythos of theirs existed in the infinite ages of the past in the greatest and profoundest repose, in the extreme rest of a placid and, if I may use the expression, stupid divinity, such as Epicurus has enjoined upon us. And yet, although they would have him be alone, they assign to him a second person in himself and with himself, Ennoea (Thought), which they also call both Charis (Grace) and Sige (Silence). Other things, as it happened, conduced in this most agreeable repose to remind him of the need of by and by producing out of himself the beginning of all things. This he deposits in lieu of seed in the genital region, as it were, of the womb of his Sige. Instantaneous conception is the result: Sige becomes pregnant, and is delivered, of course in silence; and her offspring is Nus (Mind), very like his father and his equal in every respect. In short, he alone is capable of comprehending the measureless and incomprehensible greatness of his father. Accordingly he is even called the Father himself, and the Beginning of all things, and, with great propriety, Monogenes (The Only-begotten). And yet not with absolute propriety, since he is not born alone. For along with him a female also proceeded, whose name was Veritas[fn-88-P8887_2469526:78-nf] (Truth). But how much more suitably might Monogenes be called Protogenes (First begotten), since he was begotten first! Thus Bythos and Sige, Nus. and Veritas, are alleged to be the first fourfold team[fn-88-P8888_2469838:79-nf] of the Valentinian set (of gods)[fn-88-P8889_2469886:80-nf] the parent stock and origin of them all.

If this latter existed not previously, of course she existed not in Bythos. And a pretty absurdity would it be, if Life existed not in God! However, this offspring also produces fruit, having for its mission the initiation of the universe and the formation of the entire Pleroma: it procreates Homo (Man) and Ecclesia (the Church).

Even from this fellowship in a common duty two schools actually arise, two chairs,[fn-89-P8949_2482330:128-nf] and, to some extent,[fn-89-P8950_2482369:129-nf] the inauguration of a division in the doctrine of Valentinus. It was the function of Christ to instruct the ¦ons in the nature of their conjugal relations[fn-89-P8951_2482540:130-nf] (you see what the whole thing was, of course!), and how to form some guess about the unbegotten,[fn-89-P8952_2482657:131-nf] and to give them the capacity of generating within themselves the knowledge of the Father; it being impossible to catch the idea of him, or comprehend him, or, in short, even to enjoy any perception of him, either by the eye or the ear, except through Monogenes (the Only-begotten). Well, I will even grant them what they allege about knowing the Father, so that they do not refuse us (the attainment of) the same. I would rather point out what is perverse in their doctrine, how they were taught that the incomprehensible part of the Father was the cause of their own perpetuity,[fn-89-P8953_2483268:132-nf] whilst that which might be comprehended of him was the reason[fn-89-P8954_2483413:133-nf] of their generation and formation. Now by these several positions[fn-89-P8955_2483517:134-nf] the tenet, I suppose, is insinuated, that it is expedient for God not to be apprehended, on the very ground that the incomprehensibility of His character is the cause of perpetuity; whereas what in Him is comprehensible is productive, not of perpetuity, but rather of conditions which lack perpetuity-namely, nativity and formation. The Son, indeed, they made capable of comprehending the Father. The manner in which He is comprehended, the recently produced Christ fully taught them. To the Holy Spirit, however, belonged the special gifts, whereby they, having been all set on a complete par in respect of their earnestness to learn, should be enabled to offer up their thanksgiving, and be introduced to a true tranquillity.","index":"65","references":[{"fn":"89","code":"P8944_2481531","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Ille nus.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"89","code":"P8945_2481751","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Iterum: above.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"89","code":"P8946_2481792","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Copulationem: The profane reference is to Christ and the Spirit.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"89","code":"P8947_2481975","folder":"ANF-03","text":"A shocking reference to the Spirit which I modify to one of the Divine Persons.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"89","code":"P8948_2482113","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Vulneratur.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"89","code":"P8949_2482330","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Cathedrae.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"89","code":"P8950_2482369","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Quaedam.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"89","code":"P8951_2482540","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Conjugiorum.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"89","code":"P8952_2482657","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Innati conjectationem.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"89","code":"P8953_2483268","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Perpetuitatis: i.e. \"what was unchangeable in their condition and nature.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"89","code":"P8954_2483413","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Rationem: perhaps \"the means.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"89","code":"P8955_2483517","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Hac dispositione.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter XII.-The Strange Jumble of the Pleroma.

Even the Demiurge has a Christ of His on-His natural Son. An animal, in short, produced by Himself, proclaimed by the prophets-His position being one which must be decided by prepositions; in other words, He was produced by means of a virgin, rather than of a virgin! On the ground that, having descended into the virgin rather in the manner of a passage through her than of a birth by her, He came into existence through her, not of her-not experiencing a mother in her, but nothing more than a way. Upon this same Christ, therefore (so they say.), Jesus descended in the sacrament of baptism, in the likeness of a dove. Moreover, there was even in Christ accruing from Achamoth the condiment of a spiritual seed, in order of course to prevent the corruption of all the other stuffing.[fn-91-P9118_2517068:249-nf] For after the precedent of the principal Tetrad, they guard him with four substances-the spiritual one of Achamoth, the animal one of the Demiurge, the corporeal one, which cannot be described, and that of Soter, or, in other phrase, the columbine.[fn-91-P9119_2517333:250-nf] As for Soter (Jesus), he remained in Christ to the last, impassible, incapable of injury, incapable of apprehension. By and by, when it came to a question of capture, he departed from him during the examination before Pilate. In like manner, his mother's seed did not admit of being injured, being equally exempt from all manner of outrage,[fn-91-P9120_2517715:251-nf] and being undiscovered even by the Demiurge himself. The animal and carnal Christ, however, does suffer after the fashion[fn-91-P9121_2517864:252-nf] of the superior Christ, who, for the purpose of producing Achamoth, had been stretched upon the cross, that is, Horos, in a substantial though not a cognizable[fn-91-P9122_2518049:253-nf] form.

Then after Proarche they say Arche (Beginning) came forth and occupied the first and the fifth place; from Anennoetos came Acataleptos (Incomprehensible) in the second and the sixth place; from Arrhetos came Anonomastos (Nameless) in the third and the seventh place; from Aoratos[fn-92-P9202_2532457:309-nf] came Agennetos (Unbegotten) in the fourth and the eight place.
