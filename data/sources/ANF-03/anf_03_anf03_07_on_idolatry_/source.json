Set aside names, examine works, the idolater is likewise a murderer. Do you inquire whom he has slain? If it contributes ought to the aggravation of the indictment, no stranger nor personal enemy, but his own self. By what snares? Those of his error. By what weapon? The offence done to God. By how many blows? As many as are his idolatries. He who affirms that the idolater perishes not,[fn-6-P613_267243:2-nf] will affirm that the idolater has not committed murder. Further, you may recognize in the same crime[fn-6-P614_267502:3-nf] adultery and fornication; for he who serves false gods is doubtless an adulterer[fn-6-P615_267605:4-nf] of truth, because all falsehood is adultery. So, too, he is sunk in fornication. For who that is a fellow-worker with unclean spirits, does not stalk in general pollution and fornication? And thus it is that the Holy Scriptures[fn-6-P616_267889:5-nf] use the designation of fornication in their upbraiding of idolatry. The essence of fraud, I take it, is, that any should seize what is another's, or refuse to another his due; and, of course, fraud done toward man is a name of greatest crime. Well, but idolatry does fraud to God, by refusing to Him, and conferring on others, His honours; so that to fraud it also conjoins contumely. But if fraud, just as much as fornication and adultery, entails death, then, in these cases, equally with the former, idolatry stands unacquitted of the impeachment of murder. After such crimes, so pernicious, so devouring of salvation, all other crimes also, after some manner, and separately disposed in order, find their own essence represented in idolatry. In it also are the cancupiscences of the world. For what solemnity of idolatry is without the circumstance of dress and ornament? In it are lasciviousnesses and drunkennesses; since it is, for the most part, for the sake of food, and stomach, and appetite, that these solemnities are frequented. In it is unrighteousness. For what more unrighteous than it, which knows not the Father of righteousness? In it also is vanity, since its whole system is vain. In it is mendacity, for its whole substance is false. Thus it comes to pass, that in idolatry all crimes are detected, and in all crimes idolatry. Even otherwise, since all faults savour of opposition to God, and there is nothing which savours of opposition to God which is not assigned to demons and unclean spirits, whose property idols are; doubtless, whoever commits a fault is chargeable with idolatry, for he does that which pertains to the proprietors of idols.","index":"29","references":[{"fn":"6","code":"P612_265808","folder":"ANF-03","text":"This solemn sentence vindicates the place I have given to the De Idololatria in the order adopted for this volume.

Sufficient to itself is a name so inimical to God, a substance of crime so copious, which reaches forth so many branches, diffuses so many veins, that from this name, for the greatest part, is drawn the material of all the modes in which the expansiveness of idolatry has to be foreguarded against by us, since in manifold wise it subverts the servants of God; and this not only when unperceived, but also when cloaked over. Most men simply regard idolatry as to be interpreted in these senses alone, viz.: if one burn incense, or immolate a victim, or give a sacrificial banquet, or be bound to some sacred functions or priesthoods; just as if one were to regard adultery as to be accounted in kisses, and in embraces, and in actual fleshly contact; or murder as to be reckoned only in the shedding forth of blood, and in the actual taking away of life. But how far wider an extent the Lord assigns to those crimes we are sure: when He defines adultery to consist even in concupiscence,[fn-6-P620_270867:6-nf] \"if one shall have cast an eye lustfully on,\" and stirred his soul with immodest commotion; when He judges murder[fn-6-P621_270997:7-nf] to consist even in a word of curse or of reproach, and in every impulse of anger, and in the neglect of charity toward a brother just as John teaches,[fn-6-P622_271164:8-nf] that he who hates his brother is a murderer. Else, both the devil's ingenuity in malice, and God the Lord's in the Discipline by which He fortifies us against the devil's depths,[fn-6-P623_271363:9-nf] would have but limited scope, if we were judged only in such faults as even the heathen nations have decreed punishable. How will our \"righteousness abound above that of the Scribes and Pharisees,\" as the Lord has prescribed,[fn-6-P624_271606:10-nf] unless we shall have seen through the abundance of that adversary quality, that is, of unrighteousness? But if the head of unrighteousness is idolatry, the first point is, that we be fore-fortified against the abundance of idolatry, while we recognise it not only in its palpable manifestations.","index":"31","references":[{"fn":"6","code":"P620_270867","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Matt. v. 28.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":5,"verses":[28]}]},{"fn":"6","code":"P621_270997","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Matt. 5. 22.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":5,"verses":[22]}]},{"fn":"6","code":"P622_271164","folder":"ANF-03","text":"1 John. iii. 15.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 john","chapter":3,"verses":[15]}]},{"fn":"6","code":"P623_271363","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Rev. ii. 24.","bible_refs":[{"book":"revelation","chapter":2,"verses":[24]}]},{"fn":"6","code":"P624_271606","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Matt. v. 20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":5,"verses":[20]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter III.-Idolatry: Origin and Meaning of the Name.","index":5,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Idol in ancient times there was none. Before the artificers of this monstrosity had bubbled into being,[fn-6-P628_272077:11-nf] temples stood solitary and shrines empty, just as to the present day in some places traces of the ancient practice remain permanently. Yet idolatry used to be practised, not under that name, but in that function; for even at this day it can be practised outside a temple, and without an idol. But when the devil introduced into the world artificers of statues and of images, and of every kind of likenesses, that former rude business of human disaster attained from idols both a name and a development. Thenceforward every art which in any way produces an idol instantly became a fount of idolatry. For it makes no difference whether a moulder cast, or a carver grave, or an embroiderer weave the idol; because neither is it a question of material, whether an idol be formed of gypsum, or of colors, or of stone, or of bronze,[fn-6-P629_272938:12-nf] or of silver, or of thread. For since even without an idol idolatry is committed, when the idol is there it makes no difference of what kind it be, of what material, or what shape; lest any should think that only to be held an idol which is consecrated in human shape. To establish this point, the interpretation of the word is requisite. Eidoßs, in Greek, signifies form; eido¦loßn, derived diminutively from that, by an equivalent process in our language, makes formling.[fn-6-P630_273428:13-nf] Every form or forming, therefore, claims to be called an idol. Hence idolatry is \"all attendance and service about every idol.\" Hence also, every artificer of an idol is guilty of one and the same crime,[fn-6-P631_273658:14-nf] unless, the People[fn-6-P632_273700:15-nf] which consecrated for itself the likeness of a calf, and not of a man, fell short of incurring the guilt of idolatry.[fn-6-P633_273901:16-nf] ","index":"33","references":[{"fn":"6","code":"P628_272077","folder":"ANF-03","text":"\"Boiled out,\" \"bubbled out.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"6","code":"P629_272938","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Or, brass.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"6","code":"P630_273428","folder":"ANF-03","text":"i.e., a little form.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"6","code":"P631_273658","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Idolatry, namely.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"6","code":"P632_273700","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Capitalized to mark its emphatic sense, i.e., the People of God = the Jews.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"6","code":"P633_273901","folder":"ANF-03","text":"See Ex. xxxii.; and compare 1 Cor. x. 7, where the latter part of Ex. xxxii. 6 is quoted.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":10,"verses":[7]},{"book":"exodus","chapter":32,"verses":[6]},{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":10,"verses":[7]},{"book":"exodus","chapter":32,"verses":[6]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter IV.-Idols Not to Be Made, Much Less Worshipped.

Enoch had preceded, predicting that \"the demons, and the spirits of the angelic apostates,[fn-6-P638_274936:18-nf] would turn into idolatry all the elements, all the garniture of the universe, all things contained in the heaven, in the sea, in the earth, that they might be consecrated as God, in opposition to God.\" All things, therefore, does human error worship, except the Founder of all Himself. The images of those things are idols; the consecration of the images is idolatry. Whatever guilt idolatry incurs, must necessarily be imputed to every artificer of every idol. In short, the same Enoch fore-condemns in general menace both idol-worshippers and idol-makers together. And again: \"I swear to you, sinners, that against the day of perdition of blood[fn-6-P639_275641:19-nf] repentance is being prepared. Ye who serve stones, and ye who make images of gold, and silver, and wood, and stones and clay, and serve phantoms, and demons, and spirits in fanes,[fn-6-P640_276320:20-nf] and all errors not according to knowledge, shall find no help from them.\" But Isaiah[fn-6-P641_276520:21-nf] says, \"Ye are witnesses whether there is a God except Me.\" \"And they who mould and carve out at that time were not: all vain! who do that which liketh them, which shall not profit them!\" And that whole ensuing discourse sets a ban as well on the artificers as the worshippers: the close of which is, \"Learn that their heart is ashes and earth, and that none can free his own soul.\" In which sentence David equally includes the makers too. \"Such,\" says he, \"let them become who make them.\"[fn-6-P642_277036:22-nf] And why should I, a man of limited memory, suggest anything further?

The veins of the arts are many as are the concupiscences of men. \"But there is difference in wages and the rewards of handicraft; \"therefore there is difference, too, in the labour required. Smaller wages are compensated by more frequent earning. How many are the party-walls which require statues? How many the temples and shrines which are built for idols? But houses, and official residences, and baths, and tenements, how many are they? Shoe- and slipper-gilding is daily work not so the gilding of Mercury and Serapis. Let that suffice for the gain[fn-6-P675_288040:43-nf] of handicrafts. Luxury and ostentation have more votaries than all superstition. Ostentation will require dishes and cups more easily than superstition. Luxury deals in wreaths, also, more than ceremony. When, therefore, we urge men generally to such kinds of handicrafts as do not come in contact with an idol indeed and with the things which are appropriate to an idol; since, moreover, the things which are common to idols are often common to men too; of this also we ought to beware that nothing be, with our knowledge, demanded by any person from our idols' service. For if we shall have made that concession, and shall not have had recourse to the remedies so often used, I think we are not free of the contagion of idolatry, we whose (not unwitting) hands[fn-6-P676_288894:44-nf] are found busied in the tendence, or in the honour and service, of demons.","index":"43","references":[{"fn":"6","code":"P671_286212","folder":"ANF-03","text":"See chaps. v. and xii.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"6","code":"P672_286690","folder":"ANF-03","text":"See chap. ii., \"The expansiveness of idolatry.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"6","code":"P673_286873","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Abacum.

Of astrologers there should be no speaking even;[fn-6-P681_289508:46-nf] but since one in these days has challenged us, defending on his own behalf perseverance in that profession, I will use a few words. I allege not that he honours idols, whose names he has inscribed on the heaven,[fn-6-P682_289767:47-nf] to whom he has attributed all God's power; because men, presuming that we are disposed of by the immutable arbitrament of the stars, think on that account that God is not to be sought after. One proposition I lay down: that those angels, the deserters from God, the lovers of women,[fn-6-P683_290093:48-nf] were likewise the discoverers of this curious art, on that account also condemned by God. Oh divine sentence, reaching even unto the earth in its vigour, whereto the unwitting render testimony! The astrologers are expelled just like their angels. The city and Italy are interdicted to the astrologers, just as heaven to their angels.[fn-6-P684_290622:49-nf] There is the same penalty of exclusion for disciples and masters. \"But Magi and astrologers came from the east.\"[fn-6-P685_290777:50-nf] We know the mutual alliance of magic and astrology. The interpreters of the stars, then, were the first to announce Christ's birth the first to present Him \"gifts.\" By this bond, [must] I imagine, they put Christ under obligation to themselves? What then? Shall therefore the religion of those Magi act as patron now also to astrologers? Astrology now-a-days, forsooth, treats of Christ-is the science of the stars of Christ; not of Saturn, or Mars, and whomsoever else out of the same class of the dead[fn-6-P686_291300:51-nf] it pays observance to and preaches? But, however, that science has been allowed until the Gospel, in order that after Christ's birth no one should thence forward interpret any one's nativity by the heaven. For they therefore offered to the then infant Lord that frankincense and myrrh and gold, to be, as it were, the close of worldly[fn-6-P687_291773:52-nf] sacrifice and glory, which Christ was about to do away. What, then? The dream-sent, doubtless, of the will of God-suggested to the same Magi, namely, that they should go home, but by another way, not that by which they came. It means this: that they should not walk in their ancient path.[fn-6-P688_292084:53-nf] Not that Herod should not pursue them, who in fact did not pursue them; unwitting even that they had departed by another way, since be was withal unwitting by what way they came. Just so we ought to understand by it the right Way and Discipline. And so the precept was rather, that thence forward they should walk otherwise. So, too, that other species of magic which operates by miracles, emulous even in opposition to Moses,[fn-6-P689_292526:54-nf] tried God's patience until the Gospel. For thenceforward Simon Magus, just turned believer, (since he was still thinking somewhat of his juggling sect; to wit, that among the miracles of his profession he might buy even the gift of the Holy Spirit through imposition of hands) was cursed by the apostles, and ejected from the faith.[fn-6-P690_292910:55-nf] Both he and that other magician, who was with Sergius Paulus, (since he began opposing himself to the same apostles) was mulcted with loss of eyes.[fn-6-P691_293084:56-nf] The same fate, I believe, would astrologers, too, have met, if any had fallen in the way of the apostles. But yet, when magic is punished, of which astrology is a species, of course the species is condemned in the genus. After the Gospel, you will nowhere find either sophists, Chaldeans, enchanters, diviners, or magicians, except as clearly punished. \"Where is the wise, where the grammarian, where the disputer of this age? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this age? \"[fn-6-P692_293589:57-nf] You know nothing, astrologer, if you know not that you should be a Christian.

Nay, on the contrary, we must not doubt that they are in affinity with manifold idolatry: first, in that it is necessary for them to preach the gods of the nations, to express their names, genealogies, honourable distinctions, all and singular; and further, to observe the solemnities and festivals of the same, as of them by whose means they compute their revenues. What schoolmaster, without a table of the seven idols,[fn-6-P698_294827:60-nf] will yet frequent the Quinquatria? The very first payment of every pupil he consecrates both to the honour and to the name of Minerva; so that, even though he be not said \"to eat of that which is sacrificed to idols\"[fn-6-P699_295074:61-nf] nominally (not being dedicated to any particular idol), he is shunned as an idolater. What less of defilement does he recur on that ground,[fn-7-P700_295240:62-nf] than a business brings which, both nominally and virtually, is consecrated publicly to an idol? The Minervalia are as much Minerva's, as the Saturnalia Saturn's; Saturn's, which must necessarily be celebrated even by little slaves at the time of the Saturnalia. New-year's gifts likewise must be caught at, and the Septimontium kept; and all the presents of Midwinter and the feast of Dear Kinsmanship must be exacted; the schools must be wreathed with flowers; the flamens' wives and the µdiles sacrifice; the school is honoured on the appointed holy-days. The same thing takes place on an idol's birthday; every pomp of the devil is frequented. Who will think that these things are befitting to a Christian master,[fn-7-P701_296010:63-nf] unless it be he who shall think them suitable likewise to one who is not a master? We know it may be said, \"If teaching literature is not lawful to God's servants, neither will learning be likewise; \"and, \"How could one be trained unto ordinary human intelligence, or unto any sense or action whatever, since literature is the means of training for all life? How do we repudiate secular studies, without which divine studies cannot be pursued? \"Let us see, then, the necessity of literary erudition; let us reflect that partly it cannot be admitted, partly cannot be avoided. Learning literature is allowable for believers, rather than teaching; for the principle of learning and of teaching is different. If a believer teach literature, while he is teaching doubtless he commends, while he delivers he affirms, while he recalls he bears testimony to, the praises of idols interspersed therein. He seals the gods themselves with this name;[fn-7-P702_297143:64-nf] whereas the Law, as we have said, prohibits \"the names of gods to be pronounced,\"[fn-7-P703_297254:65-nf] and this name[fn-7-P704_297344:66-nf] to be conferred on vanity.[fn-7-P705_297399:67-nf] Hence the devil gets men's early faith built up from the beginnings of their erudition. Inquire whether he who catechizes about idols commit idolatry. But when a believer learns these things, if he is already capable of understanding what idolatry is, he neither receives nor allows them; much more if he is not yet capable. Or, when he begins to understand, it behoves him first to understand what he has previously learned, that is, touching God and the faith. Therefore he will reject those things, and will not receive them; and will be as safe as one who from one who knows it not, knowingly accepts poison, but does not drink it. To him necessity is attributed as an excuse, because he has no other way to learn. Moreover, the not teaching literature is as much easier than the not learning, as it is easier, too, for the pupil not to attend, than for the master not to frequent, the rest of the defilements incident to the schools from public and scholastic solemnities.","index":"47","references":[{"fn":"6","code":"P698_294827","folder":"ANF-03","text":"i.e., the seven planets.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"6","code":"P699_295074","folder":"ANF-03","text":"See 1 Cor. viii. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":8,"verses":[10]}]},{"fn":"7","code":"P700_295240","folder":"ANF-03","text":"i.e., because \"he does not nominally eat,\" etc.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"7","code":"P701_296010","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Note the Christian Schoolmaster, already distinguished as such, implying the existence and the character of Christian schools.

Certain Trades, However Gainful, to Be Avoided.","index":13,"paragraphs":[{"text":"If we think over the rest of faults, tracing them from their generations, let us begin with covetousness, \"a root of all evils,\"[fn-7-P709_298669:68-nf] wherewith, indeed, some having been ensnared, \"have suffered shipwreck about faith.\"[fn-7-P710_298774:69-nf] Albeit covetousness is by the same apostle called idolatry.[fn-7-P711_298853:70-nf] In the next place proceeding to mendacity, the minister of covetousness (of false swearing I am silent, since even swearing is not lawful[fn-7-P712_299174:71-nf] )-is trade adapted for a servant of God? But, covetousness apart, what is the motive for acquiring? When the motive for acquiring ceases, there will be no necessity for trading. Grant now that there be some righteousness in business, secure from the duty of watchfulness against covetousness and mendacity; I take it that that trade which pertains to the very soul and spirit of idols, which pampers every demon, falls under the charge of idolatry. Rather, is not that the principal idolatry? If the selfsame merchandises-frankincense, I mean, and all other foreign productions-used as sacrifice to idols, are of use likewise to men for medicinal ointments, to us Christians also, over and above, for solaces of sepulture, let them see to it. At all events, while the pomps, while the priesthoods, while the sacrifices of idols, are furnished by dangers, by losses, by inconveniences, by cogitations, by runnings to and fro, or trades, what else are you demonstrated to be but an idols' agent? Let none contend that, in this way, exception may be taken to all trades. All graver faults extend the sphere for diligence in watchfulness proportionably to the magnitude of the danger; in order that we may withdraw not only from the faults, but from the means through which they have being. For although the fault be done by others, it makes no difference if it be by my means. In no case ought I to be necessary to another, while he is doing what to me is unlawful. Hence I ought to understand that care must be taken by me, lest what I am forbidden to do be done by my means. In short, in another cause of no lighter guilt I observe that fore-judgment. In that I am interdicted from fornication, I furnish nothing of help or connivance to others for that purpose; in that I have separated my own flesh itself from stews, I acknowledge that I cannot exercise the trade of pandering, or keep that kind of places for my neighbour's behoof. So, too, the interdiction of murder shows me that a trainer of gladiators also is excluded from the Church; nor will any one fail to be the means of doing what he subministers to another to do. Behold, here is a more kindred fore-judgment: if a purveyor of the public victims come over to the faith, will you permit him to remain permanently in that trade? or if one who is already a believer shall have undertaken that business, will you think that he is to be retained in the Church? No, I take it; unless any one will dissemble in the case of a frankincense-seller too. In sooth, the agency of blood pertains to some, that of odours to others. If, before idols were in the world, idolatry, hitherto shapeless, used to be transacted by these wares; if, even now, the work of idolatry is perpetrated, for the most part, without the idol, by burnings of odours; the frankincense-seller is a something even more serviceable even toward demons, for idolatry is more easily carried on without the idol, than without the ware of the frankincense-seller.[fn-7-P713_302192:72-nf] Let us interrogate thoroughly the conscience of the faith itself. With what mouth will a Christian frankincense-seller, if he shall pass through temples, with what mouth will he spit down upon and blow out the smoking altars, for which himself has made provision? With what consistency will he exorcise his own foster-children,[fn-7-P714_302640:73-nf] to whom he affords his own house as store-room? Indeed, if he shall have ejected a demon,[fn-7-P715_302790:74-nf] let him not congratulate himself on his faith, for he has not ejected an enemy; he ought to have had his prayer easily granted by one whom he is daily feeding.[fn-7-P716_302981:75-nf] No art, then, no profession, no trade, which administers either to equipping or forming idols, can be free from the title of idolatry; unless we interpret idolatry to be altogether something else than the service of idol-tendence.","index":"49","references":[{"fn":"7","code":"P709_298669","folder":"ANF-03","text":"1 Tim. vi. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 timothy","chapter":6,"verses":[10]}]},{"fn":"7","code":"P710_298774","folder":"ANF-03","text":"1 Tim. i. 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 timothy","chapter":1,"verses":[19]}]},{"fn":"7","code":"P711_298853","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Col. iii. 5.

You will now-a-days find more doors of heathens without lamps and laurel-wreaths than of Christians. What does the case seem to be with regard to that species (of ceremony) also? If it is an idol's honour, without doubt an idol's honour is idolatry. If it is for a man's sake, let us again consider that all idolatry is for man's sake;[fn-7-P768_315582:115-nf] let us again consider that all idolatry is a worship done to men, since it is generally agreed even among their worshippers that aforetime the gods themselves of the nations were men; and so it makes no difference whether that superstitious homage be rendered to men of a former age or of this. Idolatry is condemned, not on account of the persons which are set up for worship, but on account of those its observances, which pertain to demons. \"The things which are Cµsar's are to be rendered to Cµsar.\"[fn-7-P769_316123:116-nf] It is enough that He set in apposition thereto, \"and to God the things which are God's.\" What things, then, are Cµsar's? Those, to wit, about which the consultation was then held, whether the poll-tax should be furnished to Cµsar or no. Therefore, too, the Lord demanded that the money should be shown Him, and inquired about the image, whose it was; and when He had heard it was Cµsar's, said, \"Render to Cµsar what are Cµsar's, and what are God's to God; \"that is, the image of Cµsar, which is on the coin, to Cµsar, and the image of God, which is on man,[fn-7-P770_316731:117-nf] to God; so as to render to Cµsar indeed money, to God yourself. Otherwise, what will be God's, if all things are Cµsar's? \"Then,\" do you say, \"the lamps before my doors, and the laurels on my posts are an honour to God? \"They are there of course, not because they are an honour to God, but to him who is honour in God's stead by ceremonial observances of that kind, so far as is manifest, saving the religious performance, which is in secret appertaining to demons. For we ought to be sure if there are any whose notice it escapes through ignorance of this world's literature, that there are among the Romans even gods of entrances; Cardea (Hinge-goddess), called after hinges, and Forculus (Door-god) after doors, and Limentinus (Threshold-god) after the threshold, and Janus himself (Gate-god) after the gate: and of course we know that, though names be empty and reigned, yet, when they are drawn down into superstition, demons and every unclean spirit seize them for themselves, through the bond of consecration. Otherwise demons have no name individually, but they there find a name where they find also a token. Among the Greeks likewise we read of Apollo Thyrµus, i.e. of the door, and the Antelii, or Anthelii, demons, as presiders over entrances. These things, therefore, the Holy Spirit foreseeing from the beginning, fore-chanted, through the most ancient prophet Enoch, that even entrances would come into superstitious use. For we see too that other entrances[fn-7-P771_318261:118-nf] are adored in the baths. But if there are beings which are adored in entrances, it is to them that both the lamps and the laurels will pertain. To an idol you will have done whatever you shall have done to an entrance. In this place I call a witness on the authority also of God; because it is not safe to suppress whatever may have been shown to one, of course for the sake of all. I know that a brother was severely chastised, the same night, through a vision, because on the sudden announcement of public rejoicings his servants had wreathed his gates. And yet himself had not wreathed, or commanded them to be wreathed; for he had gone forth from home before, and on his return had reprehended the deed. So strictly are we appraised with God in matters of this kind, even with regard to the discipline of our family.[fn-7-P772_319381:119-nf] Therefore, as to what relates to the honours due to kings or emperors, we have a prescript sufficient, that it behoves us to be in all obedience, according to the apostle's precept,[fn-7-P773_319704:120-nf] \"subject to magistrates, and princes, and powers; \"[fn-7-P774_319802:121-nf] but within the limits of discipline, so long as we keep ourselves separate from idolatry. For it is for this reason, too, that that example of the three brethren has forerun us, who, in other respects obedient toward king Nebuchodonosor rejected with all constancy the honour to his image,[fn-7-P775_320112:122-nf] proving that whatever is extolled beyond the measure of human honour, unto the resemblance of divine sublimity, is idolatry. So too, Daniel, in all other points submissive to Darius, remained in his duty so long as it was free from danger to his religion;[fn-7-P776_320385:123-nf] for, to avoid undergoing that danger, he feared the royal lions no more than they the royal fires. Let, therefore, them who have no light, light their lamps daily; let them over whom the fires of hell are imminent, affix to their posts, laurels doomed presently to burn: to them the testimonies of darkness and the omens of their penalties are suitable. You are a light of the world,[fn-7-P777_320785:124-nf] and a tree ever green.[fn-7-P778_320842:125-nf] If you have renounced temples, make not your own gate a temple. I have said too little.

There is a dress proper to every one, as well for daily use as for office and dignity. That famous purple, therefore, and the gold as an ornament of the neck, were, among the Egyptians and Babylonians, ensigns of dignity, in the same way as bordered, or striped, or palm-embroidered togas, and the golden wreaths of provincial priests, are now; but not on the same terms. For they used only to be conferred, under the name of honour, on such as deserved the familiar friendship of kings (whence, too, such used to be styled the \"purpled-men\"[fn-7-P794_325944:132-nf] of kings, just as among us,[fn-7-P795_325997:133-nf] some, from their white toga, are called \"candidates\"[fn-7-P796_326101:134-nf] ); but not on the understanding that that garb should be tied to priesthoods also, or to any idol-ceremonies. For if that were the case, of course men of such holiness and constancy[fn-7-P797_326307:135-nf] would instantly have refused the defiled dresses; and it would instantly have appeared that Daniel had been no zealous slave to idols, nor worshipped Bel, nor the dragon, which long after did appear. That purple, therefore, was simple, and used not at that time to be a mark of dignity[fn-7-P798_326619:136-nf] among the barbarians, but of nobility.[fn-7-P799_326691:137-nf] For as both Joseph, who had been a slave, and Daniel, who through[fn-8-P800_326794:138-nf] captivity had changed his state, attained the freedom of the states of Babylon and Egypt through the dress of barbaric nobility;[fn-8-P801_326944:139-nf] so among us believers also, if need so be, the bordered toga will be proper to be conceded to boys, and the stole to girls,[fn-8-P802_327131:140-nf] as ensigns of birth, not of power; of race, not of office; of rank, not of superstition. But the purple, or the other ensigns of dignities and powers, dedicated from the beginning to idolatry engrafted on the dignity and the powers, carry the spot of their own profanation; since, moreover, bordered and striped togas, and broad-barred ones, are put even on idols themselves; and fasces also, and rods, are borne before them; and deservedly, for demons are the magistrates of this world: they bear the fasces and the purples, the ensigns of one college. What end, then, will you advance if you use the garb indeed, but administer not the functions of it? In things unclean, none can appear clean. If you put on a tunic defiled in itself, it perhaps may not be defiled through you; but you, through it, will be unable to be clean. Now by this time, you who argue about \"Joseph\" and \"Daniel,\" know that things old and new, rude and polished, begun and developed, slavish and free, are not always comparable. For they, even by their circumstances, were slaves; but you, the slave of none,[fn-8-P803_328441:141-nf] in so far as you are the slave of Christ alone,[fn-8-P804_328515:142-nf] who has freed you likewise from the captivity of the world, will incur the duty of acting after your Lord's pattern. That Lord walked in humility and obscurity, with no definite home: for \"the Son of man,\" said He, \"hath not where to lay His head; \"[fn-8-P805_328868:143-nf] unadorned in dress, for else He had not said, \"Behold, they who are clad in soft raiment are in kings' houses: \"[fn-8-P806_329018:144-nf] in short, inglorious in countenance and aspect, just as Isaiah withal had fore-announced.[fn-8-P807_329142:145-nf] If, also, He exercised no right of power even over His own followers, to whom He discharged menial ministry;[fn-8-P808_329272:146-nf] if, in short, though conscious of His own kingdom,[fn-8-P809_329351:147-nf] He shrank back from being made a king,[fn-8-P810_329417:148-nf] He in the fullest manner gave His own an example for turning coldly from all the pride and garb, as well of dignity as of power. For if they were to be used, who would rather have used them than the Son of God? What kind and what number of fasces would escort Him? what kind of purple would bloom from His shoulders? what kind of gold would beam from His head, had He not judged the glory of the world to be alien both to Himself and to His? Therefore what He was unwilling to accept, He has rejected; what He rejected, He has condemned; what He condemned, He has counted as part of the devil's pomp. For He would not have condemned things, except such as were not His; but things which are not God's, can be no other's but the devil's. If you have forsworn \"the devil's pomp,\"[fn-8-P811_330215:149-nf] know that whatever there you touch is idolatry. Let even this fact help to remind you that all the powers and dignities of this world are not only alien to, but enemies of, God; that through them punishments have been determined against God's servants; through them, too, penalties prepared for the impious are ignored. But \"both your birth and your substance are troublesome to you in resisting idolatry.\"[fn-8-P812_330641:150-nf] For avoiding it, remedies cannot be lacking; since, even if they be lacking, there remains that one by which you will be made a happier magistrate, not in the earth, but in the heavens.[fn-8-P813_330951:151-nf] ","index":"63","references":[{"fn":"7","code":"P794_325944","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Or, \"purpurates.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"7","code":"P795_325997","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Not us Christians, but us Roman citizens.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"7","code":"P796_326101","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Or, \"white-men.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"7","code":"P797_326307","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Or, \"consistency.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"7","code":"P798_326619","folder":"ANF-03","text":"i.e., Official character.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"7","code":"P799_326691","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Or, \"free\" or \"good\" \"birth.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"8","code":"P800_326794","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Or, \"during.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"8","code":"P801_326944","folder":"ANF-03","text":"i.e., the dress was the sign that they had obtained it.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"8","code":"P802_327131","folder":"ANF-03","text":"I have departed from Oehler's reading here, as I have not succeeded in finding that the \"stola\" was a boy's garment; and, for grammatical reasons, the reading of Gelenius and Pamelius (which I have taken) seems best.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"8","code":"P803_328441","folder":"ANF-03","text":"See 1 Cor. ix. 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":9,"verses":[19]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P804_328515","folder":"ANF-03","text":"St. Paul in his epistle glories in the title, \"Paul, a slave,\" or \"bondman,\" \"of Christ Jesus.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"8","code":"P805_328868","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Luke ix. 58; Matt. viii. 20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":9,"verses":[58]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":8,"verses":[20]},{"book":"luke","chapter":9,"verses":[58]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":8,"verses":[20]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P806_329018","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Matt. xi. 8; Luke vii. 25.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":11,"verses":[8]},{"book":"luke","chapter":7,"verses":[25]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":11,"verses":[8]},{"book":"luke","chapter":7,"verses":[25]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P807_329142","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Isa. liii. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":53,"verses":[2]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P808_329272","folder":"ANF-03","text":"See John xiii. 1-17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":13,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P809_329351","folder":"ANF-03","text":"See John xviii. 36.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":18,"verses":[36]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P810_329417","folder":"ANF-03","text":"John vi. 15.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":6,"verses":[15]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P811_330215","folder":"ANF-03","text":"In baptism.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"8","code":"P812_330641","folder":"ANF-03","text":"i.e., From your birth and means, you will be expected to fill offices which are in some way connected with idolatry.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"8","code":"P813_330951","folder":"ANF-03","text":"sitting on a throne","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter XIX.-Concerning Military Service.","index":21,"paragraphs":[{"text":"In that last section, decision may seem to have been given likewise concerning military service, which is between dignity and power.[fn-8-P817_331353:152-nf] But now inquiry is made about this point, whether a believer may turn himself unto military service, and whether the military may be admitted unto the faith, even the rank and file, or each inferior grade, to whom there is no necessity for taking part in sacrifices or capital punishments.

I know that one (whom the Lord pardon!), when it had been said to him in public during a law-suit, \"Jupiter be wroth with you,\" answered, \"On the contrary, with you.\" What else would a heathen have done who believed Jupiter to be a god? For even had he not retorted the malediction by Jupiter (or other such like), yet, by merely returning a curse, he would have confirmed the divinity of Jove, showing himself irritated by a malediction in Jove's name. For what is there to be indignant at, (if cursed) in the name of one whom you know to be nothing? For if you rave, you immediately affirm his existence, and the profession of your fear will be an act of idolatry. How much more, while you are returning the malediction in the name of Jupiter himself, are you doing honour to Jupiter in the same way as he who provoked you! But a believer ought to laugh in such cases, not to rave; nay, according to the precept,[fn-8-P842_338352:169-nf] not to return a curse in the name of God even, but dearly to bless in the name of God, that you may both demolish idols and preach God, and fulfil discipline.","index":"70","references":[{"fn":"8","code":"P841_336294","folder":"ANF-03","text":"i.e., for fear of being discovered to be a Christian (Oehler).","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"8","code":"P842_338352","folder":"ANF-03","text":"See Matt. v. 44, 1 Pet. iii. 9, etc.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":5,"verses":[44]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter XXII.-Of Accepting Blessing in the Name of Idols.","index":24,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Equally, one who has been initiated into Christ will not endure to be blessed in the name of the gods of the nations, so as not always to reject the unclean benediction, and to cleanse it out for himself by converting it Godward.

If I have given an alms, or shown any other kindness, and the recipient pray that his gods, or the Genius of the colony, may be propitious to me, my oblation or act will immediately be an honour to idols, in whose name he returns me the favour of blessing. But why should he not know that I have done it for God's sake; that God may rather be glorified, and demons may not be honoured in that which I have done for the sake of God?

In borrowing money from heathens under pledged[fn-8-P851_340286:172-nf] securities, Christians give a guarantee under oath, and deny themselves to have done so. Of course, the time of the prosecution, and the place of the judgment seat, and the person of the presiding judge, decide that they knew themselves to have so done.[fn-8-P852_340564:173-nf] Christ prescribes that there is to be no swearing. \"I wrote,\" says the debtor, \"but I said nothing. It is the tongue, not the written letter, which kills.\" Here I call Nature and Conscience as my witnesses: Nature, because even if the tongue in dictating remains motionless and quiet, the hand can write nothing which the soul has not dictated; albeit even to the tongue itself the soul may have dictated either something conceived by itself, or else something delivered by another. Now, lest it be said, \"Another dictated,\" I here appeal to Conscience whether, what another dictated, the soul entertains,[fn-8-P853_342253:174-nf] and transmits unto the hand, whether with the concomitance or the inaction of the tongue. Enough, that the Lord has said faults are committed in the mind and the conscience. If concupiscence or malice have ascended into a man's heart, He saith it is held as a deed.[fn-8-P854_342611:175-nf] You therefore have given a guarantee; which clearly has \"ascended into your heart,\" which you can neither contend you were ignorant of nor unwilling; for when you gave the guarantee, you knew that you did it; when you knew, of course you were willing: you did it as well in act as in thought; nor can you by the lighter charge exclude the heavier,[fn-8-P855_342983:176-nf] so as to say that it is clearly rendered false, by giving a guarantee I for what you do not actually perform. \"Yet I have not denied, because I have not sworn.\" But you have sworn, since, even if you had done no such thing, you would still be said to swear, if you have even consented to so doing. Silence of voice is an unavailing plea in a case of writing; and muteness of sound in a case of letters. For Zacharias, when punished with a temporary privation of voice, holds colloquy with his mind, and, passing by his bootless tongue, with the help of his hands dictates from his heart, and without his mouth pronounces the name of his son.[fn-8-P856_343749:177-nf] Thus, in his pen there speaks a hand clearer than every sound, in his waxen tablet there is heard a letter more vocal that every mouth.[fn-8-P857_343917:178-nf] Inquire whether a man have spoken who is understood to have spoken.[fn-8-P858_344584:179-nf] Pray we the Lord that no necessity for that kind of contract may ever encompass us; and if it should so fall out, may He give our brethren the means of helping us, or give us constancy to break off all such necessity, lest those denying letters, the substitutes for our mouth, be brought forward against us in the day of judgment, sealed with the seals, not now of witnesses, but of angels!","index":"74","references":[{"fn":"8","code":"P851_340286","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Or, \"mortgaged.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"8","code":"P852_340564","folder":"ANF-03","text":"by so doing","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"8","code":"P853_342253","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Mr. Dodgson renders \"conceiveth;\" and the word is certainly capable of that meaning.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"8","code":"P854_342611","folder":"ANF-03","text":"See Matt. v. 28.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":5,"verses":[28]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P855_342983","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Oehler understands \"the lighter crime\" or \"charge\" to be \"swearing;\" the \"heavier,\" to be \"denying the Lord Christ.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"8","code":"P856_343749","folder":"ANF-03","text":"See Luke i. 20,22,62,63.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":1,"verses":[20]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P857_343917","folder":"ANF-03","text":"So obscure however, is Dodgson's rendering that I have slightly changed the punctuation, to clarify it, and subjoin Oehler's text.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"8","code":"P858_344584","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Elucidation IV.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter XXIV.-General Conclusion.","index":26,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Amid these reefs and inlets, amid these shallows and straits of idolatry, Faith, her sails filled by the Spirit of God, navigates; safe if cautious, secure if intently watchful.

This shall be our Law, the more fully to be administered the more ready it is to hand; (a Law) peculiar to Christians, by means whereof we are recognised and examined by heathens.
