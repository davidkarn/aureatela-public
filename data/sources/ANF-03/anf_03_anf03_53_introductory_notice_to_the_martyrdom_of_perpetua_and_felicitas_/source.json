It illustrates the period of history we are now considering, and sheds light on the preceding treatise. I can hardly read it without tears, and it ought to make us love \"the noble army of martyrs.\" I think Tertullian was the editor of the story, not its author.[fn-120-P12093_3372370:10-nf] Felicitas is mentioned by name in the De Anima: and the closing paragraph of this memoir is quite in his style. To these words I need only add that Dr. Routh, who unfortunately decided not to re-edit it, ascribes the first edition to Lucas Holstenius. He was Librarian of the Vatican and died in 1661. The rest may be learned from this Introductory Notice of the Translator:","index":"4","references":[{"fn":"120","code":"P12093_3372370","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Cap. lv.

There is therefore, good reason for rejecting the opinion held by some, that they suffered under Valerian and Gallienus. Some think that they suffered at Tuburbium in Mauritania; but the more general opinion is, that Carthage was the scene of their martyrdom.","index":"5","references":[{"fn":"120","code":"P12095_3373007","folder":"ANF-03","text":"In the De Anima, cap. lv. as see above.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"The \"Acta,\" detailing the sufferings of Perpetua and Felicitas, has been held by all critics to be a genuine document of antiquity. But much difference exists as to who was the compiler. In the writing itself, Perpetua and Saturus are mentioned as having written certain portions of it; and there is no reason to doubt the statement. Who the writer of the remaining portion was, is not known. Some have assigned the work to. Tertullian; some have maintained that, whoever the writer was, he was a Montanist, and some have tried to show that both martyrs and narrator were Montanists.[fn-120-P12097_3374021:12-nf] The narrator must have been a contemporary; according to many critics, he was an eye-witness of the sufferings of the martyrs.
