Yet they are not contrary. For the same Christ is by nature God and man; as God He strengthens them that need consolation; as man He receives consolation through an angel. And although the Godhead and the Spirit were present as an anointing, the body and the soul were not then supported either by the Godhead united to them or by the Holy Ghost, but this service was entrusted to an angel in order to exhibit the infirmity both of the soul and of the body and that through the infirmity might be seen the natures of the infirm. Now these things plainly happened by the permission of the divine nature, that, among them that were to live in future times, believers in the assumption of the soul and of the body might be vindicated by these demonstrations, and their opponents by plain proof convicted. If then the union was effected by the conception, and, as they argue, made both natures one, how could the properties of the natures continue unimpaired, the soul agonize, and the body sweat so as to sweat bloody drops from excess of fear?

For Christ commended it to the Father. He did not yield it to death. If then they that deny the assumption of the soul, and maintain God the Word to be a creature, and assert that He was in the body in place of a soul, deny that He was delivered to death, how can they obtain pardon who while they confess one substance of the Trinity, and leave the soul in its own immortality, impudently dare to say that God the Word of one substance with the Father tasted death?","index":"42","references":[{"fn":"53","code":"P5319_1280284","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Luke xxiii. 46.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":23,"verses":[46]}]},{"fn":"53","code":"P5320_1280663","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Luke xxiii. 46.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":23,"verses":[46]}]},{"fn":"53","code":"P5321_1280758","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Mark xv. 39.","bible_refs":[{"book":"mark","chapter":15,"verses":[39]}]},{"fn":"53","code":"P5322_1280827","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Matt. xxvii. 50.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":27,"verses":[50]}]},{"fn":"53","code":"P5323_1280891","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"John xix. 30.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":19,"verses":[30]}]}]},{"text":"13.
