I think that, when she reads this, she will find it expressed with such brevity that a vast meaning is unfolded in each several line, with such power that a sentence only a line long would suffice for a whole life's training, and yet with such simplicity that one who looked over the shoulder of a girl as she read it might question whether I were not quite weak in intellect. And the whole work is so concise that it would be possible for her never to let go of it. The entire book would hardly be bigger than the finger ring of one of our ancestors. And indeed it seems but right that one who has learnt through the word of God to count as dross the ornaments of the world should now receive at my hands by way of ornament a necklace of the word and of wisdom. For the present let this little book serve for a ring and be kept constantly in the hands: but it will not be long before it will penetrate into the treasure house and be wholly laid up in the heart, and bring forth from its innermost chamber the germs of instruction and of a participation in all good works. I have added further a few choice sayings addressed by a pious father to his son, but all so succinct that the whole of this. little work may rightly be called in Greek the Enchiridion[fn-99-P9918_2801746:1-nf] or in Latin the Annulus.[fn-99-P9919_2801800:2-nf] ","index":"7","references":[{"fn":"99","code":"P9918_2801746","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"A thing held in the hand.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"99","code":"P9919_2801800","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"A ring.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"","index":"8","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"9","references":[]}]}]}
