Fab. i. 24) in the reign of Antoninus, a.d. 138-161, is described by the Ps. Tertullian as denying that Christ came in the substance of the flesh, but in appearance only. According to Marcion the greater follower of Cerdo, Christ was not born at all, but came down from heaven to Capernaum a.d. 29, his body being an appearance and his death an illusion. Simon Magus, the \"father of all heretics\" of Irenaeus (adv. Haer. pr. in lib. iii.) is apparently quoted rather as the supposed originator of Gnosticism, than from any definite knowledge of his tenets.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"The acknowledgment of His birth from a Virgin, but coupled with the assertion that this birth was merely a process of transition, and that God the Word took nothing of the Virgin's nature, is stolen from Valentinus and Bardesanes and the adherents of their fables.[fn-27-P2799_864028:6-nf] ","index":"12","references":[{"fn":"27","code":"P2799_864028","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Valentinus (taught at Rome c. 140) the arch.gnostic is identified with the doctrine of emanation.

I shall write it in the form of a dialogue with questions and answers, propositions, solutions, and antitheses, and all else that a dialogue ought to have. I shall not insert the names of the questioners and respondents in the body of the dialogue as did the wise Greeks of old, but I shall write them at the side at the beginning of the paragraphs. They, indeed, put their writings in the hands of readers highly and variously educated, and to whom literature was life. I, on the contrary, wish the reading of what I write, and the discovery of whatever good it may give, to be an easy task, even to the illiterate. This I think will be facilitated if the characters of the interlocutors are plainly shown by their names in the margin, so the disputant who argues on behalf of the apostolical decrees is called \"Orthodoxos,\" and his opponent \"Eranistes.\" A man who is fed by the charity of many we commonly call \"Beggar;\" a man who knows how to get money together we call a \"Chrematistes.\" So we have given our disputant this name from his character and pursuits.","index":"15","references":[]},{"text":"I beg that all those into whose hands my book may fall will lay aside all preconceived opinion and put the truth to the test. For clearness' sake I will divide my book into three dialogues. The first will contain the contention that the Godhead of the only-begotten Son is immutable. The second will by God's help show that the union of the Godhead and the manhood of the Lord Christ is without confusion. The third will contend for the impassibility of the divinity of our saviour. After these three disputations we will subjoin several others as it were to complete them, giving formal proof under each head, and making it perfectly plain that the apostles' doctrine is preserved by us.","index":"16","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"17","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"18","references":[]}]}]}
