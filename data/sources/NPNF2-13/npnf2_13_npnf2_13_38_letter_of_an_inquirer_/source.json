And when the house has become a dwelling-place, then the man begins to be anxious as to\nthat which is required for Him Who dwells in the building. Just as if a king or an honourable man, to\nwhom a royal name is given, should lodge in the house, there would be required for the King all the\nappurtenances of royalty and all the service that is needed for the King's honour. For in a house\nthat is void of all good things, the King will not lodge, nor will he dwell in the midst of it; but\nall that is choicest in the house is required for the King and that nothing in it be deficient. And\nif anything be deficient there in the house in which the King lodges, the keeper of the house is\ndelivered over to death, because he did not make ready the service for the King. So also let the man,\nwho becomes a house, yea a dwelling-place, for Christ, take heed to what is needed for the service of\nChrist, Who lodges in him, and with what things he may please Him. For first he builds his building\non the Stone, which is Christ. On Him, on the Stone, is faith based, and on faith is reared up all\nthe structure. For the habitation of the house is required pure fasting, and it is made firm by\nfaith. There is also needed for it pure prayer, and through faith is it accepted. Necessary for it\ntoo is love, and with faith is it compounded. Furthermore alms are needed, and through faith are they\ngiven. He demands also meekness, and by faith is it adorned.

So the Prophet cried unto them:-Light you a lamp and seek ye the Lord.[fn-39-P3994_1330283:50-nf] And furthermore the Prophet Isaiah also\nsaid:-Seek ye the Lord and when ye shall have found Him, call upon Him; and when He is near let\nthe sinner abandon his way and the wicked man his thought.[fn-39-P3995_1330495:51-nf] For that lamp shone and they did not by it seek\nthe Lord their God.

In the last day that building shall be\ntried by fire; for the gold and silver and goodly stones shall be preserved in the midst of the fire,\nbecause they are a firm building. But as for the straw and reed and stubble, the fire shall have\npower upon them and they shall be burned. And what is the gold and silver and goodly stones by which\nthe building is raised up? Clearly the good deeds of faith, which shall be preserved in the midst of\nthe fire; because Christ dwells in that secure building, and He is its preserver from the fire. And\nlet us consider and understand (this) from the example that God has given us also in the former\ndispensation, because the promises of that dispensation will abide sure for us. Let us then\nunderstand from (the case of) those three righteous men who were cast into the midst of the fire and\nwere not burned, namely, Hananiah, Azariah and Misael, over whom the fire had no power, because they\nbuilt a secure building and rejected the commandment of Nebuchadnezzar the king and did not worship\nthe image that he made. And as for those who transgressed the commandment of God, the fire at once\nprevailed over them and burned them, and they were burned without mercy.

And if anyone, whose conscience lacks knowledge, should dispute about this and\nsay:-\"Since Christ is one and His Father is one, how does Christ dwell, and His Father dwell, in\nfaithful men? And how do righteous men become temples for God that He should dwell in them? If then\nit is thus, that to each several faithful man there comes a several Christ, and God Who is in\nChrist,-if it is so, there are for them Gods many and Christs without number.\" But hear, my beloved,\nthe defence that is suited to this argument. From that which is visible let him that has thus said\nreceive instruction. For every man knows that the sun is fixed in the heavens, yet its rays are\nspread out in the earth, and (light) from it enters by many doors and windows of houses; and wherever\nthe sunshine falls, though it be but as (the measure of) the palm of the hand, it is called the sun.\nAnd though it fall in many places, it is thus called, but the real sun itself is in heaven.\nTherefore, if it is so, have they many suns? Also the water of the sea is vast, and when thou\ntakest one cup from it, that is called water. And though thou shouldest divide it into a thousand\nvessels, yet it is called water by its name. Also when thou kindlest fire from fire in many places,\nthe place from whence thou takest it, when thou kindlest it, lacks not, and the fire is called by one\nname. And because thou dividest it into many places, it does not on that account become possessed of\nmany names. And when thou takest dust from the earth, and castest it into many places, it is not a\nwhit diminished, and also thou canst not call it by many names. Thus also God and His Christ, though\nthey are One, yet dwell in men who are many. And they are in heaven in person, and are diminished in\nnothing when they dwell in many; as the sun is not a whir diminished in heaven, when its power is\npoured out in the earth. How much greater then is the power of God, since by the power of God the\nvery sun itself subsists.","index":"64","references":[]},{"text":"§12.

Remember the warning that\nthe Apostle gives us:-Grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby ye have been sealed unto the day of\nredemption. For from baptism do we receive the Spirit of Christ. For in that hour in which the\npriests invoke the Spirit, the heavens open and it descends and moves upon the waters.[fn-42-P4284_1422848:106-nf] And those that are baptized are clothed in it;\nfor the Spirit stays aloof from all that are born of the flesh, until they come to the new birth by\nwater, and then they receive the Holy Spirit.

And the animal spirit is buried in its nature, and sense is taken away\nfrom it. Whosoever guards the Spirit of Christ in purity, when it returns to Christ it thus addresses\nhim:-\"The body into which I went, and which put me on from the water of the baptism, has kept me in\nholiness.\" And the Holy Spirit will be earnest with Christ for the resurrection of that body which\nkept Him with purity, and the Spirit will request to be again conjoined to it that that body may rise\nup in glory. And whatever man there is that receives the Spirit from the water (of baptism) and\ngrieves it, it departs from him until he dies, and returns according to its nature to Christ, and\naccuses that man of having grieved it.

Therefore, my beloved, when the Holy Spirit departs from a man who has received it,\nuntil it returns and comes to him, then Satan draws near unto that man, to cause him to sin, and that\nthe Holy Spirit may leave him altogether. For as long as the Spirit is with a man, Satan fears to\ncome near him. And observe, my beloved, that our Lord also, Who was born from the Spirit, was not\ntempted by Satan until in baptism He received the Spirit from on high. And then the Spirit led him\nforth to be tempted by Satan. This, then, is the way with man; that in the hour in which he perceives\nin himself that he is not fervent in the Spirit, and that his heart is inclining to the thought of\nthis world, he may know that the Spirit is not with him, and may arise and pray and keep vigil that\nthe Spirit of God may come to him, that he be not overcome by the adversary. A thief does not dig\ninto a house, until he sees that its master is departing from it. Thus also Satan cannot draw near to\nthat house which is our body, until the Spirit of Christ departs from it. And be sure, my beloved,\nthat the thief does not certainly know whether the master of the house is within or not, but first\nhe applies his ear, and looks. If he hears the voice of the master of the house within it\nsaying:-\"I have a journey to go,\" and when he has searched out and seen that the master of the house\nhas set out to perform his business, then the thief comes and digs into the house and steals. But if\nhe hears the voice of the master of the house admonishing and commanding his household to watch and\nguard his house, and saying to them, \"I also am within the house,\" then the thief will fear and flee,\nthat he may not be taken and captured. Thus also Satan, he has not the knowledge beforehand to know\nor see when the Spirit will depart, that so he may come to rob the man; but he too listens and\nwatches, and so assails. But if he hears a man in whom Christ dwells speaking shameful words, or\nenraged, or quarrelling, or contending, then Satan knows that Christ is not with him, and he comes\nand accomplishes his will in him. For Christ dwells in the peaceful and the meek, and lodges in those\nthat fear His word, as He says through the prophet:-On whom shall I look, and in whom shall I\ndwell, but in the peaceful and the meek who fear My word?[fn-42-P4299_1430629:118-nf] And our Lord said:-Whoever walks in My\ncommandments and keeps My love, We will come to him and make Our abode him.[fn-43-P4300_1430764:119-nf] But if he hears from a man that he is on his\nguard and is praying anti meditating in the Law of his Lord by day and by night, then he turns back\nfrom him, for he knows that Christ is with him. And if thou shouldest say, \"How manifold is Satan!\nfor lo! he fights with many;\" then hear and learn from that which I proved to thee above concerning\nChrist, that no matter to what extent He is divided amongst many, yet He is not a whit diminished.\nFor, as the house, through the window of which a little sunlight enters, is altogether illumined, so\nthe man into whom a little of Satan enters, is altogether darkened. Hear that which the Apostle\nsaid:-If Satan is transfigured to an angel of light, it is no wonder if his ministers also are\ntransfigured to ministers of righteousness.[fn-43-P4301_1431564:120-nf] And again our Lord said to His disciples:-Lo,\nI have given you authority to tread upon the power of the adversary.[fn-43-P4302_1431705:121-nf] And the Scriptures have made known that he has\npower and also ministers. Moreover Job said concerning him:-God made him to wage his\nwar.[fn-43-P4303_1431861:122-nf] These ministers then that he\nhas, he causes to run in the world, to wage war.

And whosoever honours the Spirit, and it is\nguarded in him in purity, in that day the Holy Spirit shall protect him, and he shall become\naltogether spiritual, and shall not be found naked; as the Apostle said:-And when we shall have\nclothed ourselves, may we not be found naked.[fn-43-P4308_1433730:126-nf] And again he said:-We shall all sleep, but in\nthe resurrection we shall not all be changed.[fn-43-P4309_1433841:127-nf] And again he said:-This which dies shall put\non that which dies not, and this which is corruptible that which is incorruptible, and when this\nwhich dies shall have put on that which dies not, and this corruptible that which is incorruptible,\nthen shall be accomplished that word which is written that death is swallowed up by\nvictory.[fn-43-P4310_1434308:128-nf] Again he said:-Suddenly\nas the twinkling of an eye, the dead shall rise incorruptible and we shall be changed.[fn-43-P4311_1434445:129-nf] And they who shall be changed shall put on the\nform of that heavenly Adam and shall become spiritual.

And He(God) gave him authority over all that He had made, just as a man who\nhas a son and desires to make for him a marriage feast, betroths to him a wife and builds for him a\nhouse, and prepares and adorns all that is needed for his son; then he makes the marriage feast and\ngives his son authority over his house. So after the conception of Adam, He brought him forth and\ngave him authority over all his creation. Concerning this the Prophet said :-Thou, Lord, hast been\nour habitation for generations, before the mountains were conceived, and before the earth travailed\nand before the world was framed. From age unto age Thou art the Lord. That no one should suppose\nthat there is another God, either before or afterwards, he said:-From age and unto age, just\nas Isaiah said:-I am the first and I am the last.[fn-44-P4472_1492680:22-nf] And after that God brought forth Adam from within\nHis thought, He fashioned him, and breathed into him of His Spirit, and gave him the knowledge of\ndiscernment, that he might discern good from evil, and might know that God made him. And inasmuch as\nman knew his Maker, God was formed and conceived within his thought, and he became a temple for God\nhis Maker, as it is written, Ye are the temple of God. And(so) He Himself said:-I will\ndwell in them and walk in them. But as for the sons of Adam, who do not recognise their Maker, He\nis not formed within them, and does not dwell in them, and is not conceived in their thought; but\nthey are accounted before Him as the beasts, and as the rest of the creatures.","index":"117","references":[{"fn":"44","code":"P4472_1492680","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"Is. xliv. 6; xlviii.12","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":44,"verses":[6]},{"book":"isaiah","chapter":44,"verses":[6]}]}]},{"text":"§8.

And when as yet He had not come, I beforehand have believed on Him; and\nthrough Him I worship the God of Israel. When He comes, will He then blame me because before His\ncoming I beforehand believed on Him? But, thou fool, the prophets suffer thee not to say that Christ\nhas not yet come; for Daniel confutes thee,[fn-44-P4481_1497406:28-nf] saying:-After sixty-two weeks shall Messiah\ncome and shall be slain. And in His coming shall the Holy City be laid waste, and her end shall be\nwith a flood. And until the accomplishment of the things that are determined, shall she continue in\ndesolation. Thou expectest and hopest that, at the coming of Christ, Israel shall be gathered\ntogether from all regions, and Jerusalem shall be built up and inhabited. But Daniel testifies that,\nwhen Christ comes and is slain, Jerusalem shall be destroyed, and shall continue in desolation until\nthe accomplishment of the things which are determined, forever. And concerning the suffering of\nChrist, David said:-They pierced my hands and my feet, and all my bones cried out. They gazed and\nlooked upon me, and divided my garments amongst them, and upon my vesture did they cast the\nlot.[fn-44-P4482_1498258:29-nf] And Isaiah said:-Lo! My\nservant shall be known and shall be revealed and shall be lifted up, so that many shall be astonished\nat Him. As for this man, His visage shall be marred more than that of man, and His aspect more than\nthat of the sons of men.[fn-44-P4483_1498530:30-nf] And he\nsaid:-He will purify many nations, and kings shall be amazed at Him.[fn-44-P4484_1498627:31-nf] And he said in that passage:-He came up as a\nlittle child before Him, and as a root from the dry ground.[fn-44-P4485_1498751:32-nf] And in the end of the passage he said:-He\nshall be slain for our sins; He shall be humiliated for our iniquity; the chastisement of our peace\nis upon Him, and by His bruises shall we be healed.[fn-44-P4486_1498964:33-nf] By what wounds were men healed? David was not\nslain; for he died in a good old age, and was buried in Bethlehem. And if they should say that it is\nspoken of Saul, for Saul was killed in the mountains of Gilboa in the battle with the Philistines,\nand if they should say that they pierced his hands and his feet, when they fastened up his\nbody on the wall of Bethshan; yet it does not fitly apply to Saul. When the limbs of Saul were\npierced, his bones were not conscious of suffering, because he was dead. It was after Saul died, that\nthey hanged his body and those of his sons on the wall of Bethshan. But when David said, They\npierced my hands and my feet, and all my bones cried out, he said in the next verse:-O God,\nabide for my help, and deliver my soul from the sword.[fn-44-P4487_1499757:34-nf] Now Christ was delivered from the sword, and\nascended from out of Sheol, and revived and rose the third day, and so God abode for His help.\nBut Saul called upon the Lord and He did not answer him; and he asked through the Prophets, but no\nanswer was given to him. And he disguised himself and inquired by soothsayers, and learned from\nthence. He was worsted before the Philistines, and he slew himself with his own sword, when he saw\nthat the battle had overcome him. Moreover in this passage David said:-I will declare Thy name\nunto my brethren, and in the midst of the congregation will I glorify Thee.[fn-44-P4488_1500385:35-nf] How can these things apply to Saul? And again\nDavid said:-Thou didst not give Thy holy one to see corruption.[fn-44-P4489_1500514:36-nf] But all these things fitly apply to Christ. When\nHe came to them, they did not receive Him; but wickedly judged Him by false witness. And He was hung\nupon the tree by His hands, and they pierced His hands and His feet with the nails which they\nfastened in him; and all His bones cried out. And on that day a great prodigy happened. namely, that\nthe light became dark in the middle of the day, as Zechariah prophesied, saying:-The day shall be\nknown unto the Lord. It shall not be daytime, and it shall not be night; and at the evening time\nthere shall be light.[fn-44-P4490_1501095:37-nf] Now what is the\nday that was distinguished by the prodigy, that it was neither daytime nor night, and that at the\nevening time there was light? Evidently the day on which they crucified Him, for in the midst of that\nday there came darkness, and at the evening time there was light. And again he said:-That day\nthere shall be cold and frost.[fn-44-P4491_1501455:38-nf] -As\nthou knowest, on that day on which they crucified Him, it was cold, and they had made them a fire to\nwarm themselves when Simon came and stood with them.

For they added many(afflictions) to Him, much that was not written concerning\nHim, cursings and revilings, such as the Scripture could not reveal, for their revilings were\nhateful.

For it is written that when Korah and his companions made a schism against Moses,\nthe earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up, and they went down alive into Sheol.[fn-46-P4671_1574238:35-nf] Therefore that was the mouth of Sheol that was\nopened in the wilderness.

And God will make a new thing for the\nchildren of Adam, and they shall inherit inheritances in the Kingdom of Heaven. If He shall give them\ninheritance in the earth, it shall be called the kingdom of heaven. And if in Heaven, it is easy for\nHim to do. For with the kings of the earth also, although each one of them abides in his own place,\nyet every place to which their authority extends, is called their kingdom. So the sun is a luminary\nset in the heaven, yet for every place to which its rays extend, its authority suffices, whether on\nsea or on land.

As for the sun that is with thee,\nthou wise man, from thy childhood till the completion of thy old age, thou knowest not where he runs\nin the night-time, so as to circle round to the place of its course.

Faith is the foundation, and upon faith (rest) the works that become\nit. And after Faith (I wrote) that there are two commandments of Love. And after Love, I have\nwritten of Fasting, in its demonstration also along with its works. And after Fasting, I wrote\nof Prayer in its fruit and in its works. And after Prayer, have written about War and\nabout whatever Daniel wrote concerning the kingdoms. And after War, I have written of the exhortation\nfor Monks. And after the Monks, I have written about Repentance. And after Repentance,\nI have written about the Resurrection of the dead. And after the Resurrection of the dead, I\nhave written about Humility. And after Humility, I have written of the Pastors, the\nteachers. And after the Pastors, I have written about the Circumcision in which the people of\nthe Jews pride themselves. And after the Circumcision, I have written about the Passover, and\nabout the fourteenth day. And after the Passover, I have written about the Sabbath, in which\nthe Jews are puffed up.

And after\nthe Gentiles, I have written and proved that God has a Son. And after the Son of God, I\nhave written against the Jews, who speak injuriously about Virginity. And after the apology\nabout Virginity, I have written again Against the Jews, who say:-\"It is appointed for us to be\ngathered together.\" And after that defence, I have written about Almsgiving to the Poor.

These things I have written according to what I have attained to. But if anyone shall\nread these dicourses, and find words that do not agree with his thought, he ought not to scorn them;\nbecause whatsoever is written in these chapters was not written according to the thought of one man,\nnor for the persuasion of one reader; but according to the thought of all the Church, and for the\npersuasion of all faith. If he shall read and hear with persuasion, it is well; and if not, it is\nmeet for me to say that I wrote for those open to persuasion and not for mockers. And if again any\nreader should find words that are spoken by us in one fashion, and by another sage in another\nfashion, let him not be disturbed at this; for every man speaks to his hearers according to what he\ncan attain to. So I, who have written these things, even if some of the words do not agree with what\nother speakers have said, yet say this; that those sages have spoken well, yet it seemed good to me\nto speak thus. And if any man shall speak and demonstrate to me about any matter, I will receive\ninstruction from him without contention. Everyone who reads the sacred scriptures, both former and\nlatter, in both covenants, and reads with persuasion, will learn and teach. But if he strives about\nanything that he does not understand, his mind does not receive teaching. But if he finds words that\nare too difficult for him, and he does not understand their force, let him say thus, \"Whatsoever is\nwritten is written well, but I have not attained to the understanding of it.\" And if he shall ask\nabout the matters that are too hard for him of wise and discerning men who inquire into doctrine,\nthen, when ten wise men shall speak to him in ten different ways about one matter, let him accept\nthat which pleases him; and if any please not him, let him not scorn the sages; for the word of God\nis like a pearl, that has a beautiful appearance on whatever side you turn it. And remember, O\ndisciple, what David said, From all my teachers have I learned.[fn-46-P4683_1582010:45-nf] And the Apostle said:-Thou readest every\nScripture that is in the Spirit of God. And prove everything; hold fast that which is good; and flee\nfrom every evil thing.[fn-46-P4684_1582194:46-nf] For if the days\nof a man should be many as all the days of the world from Adam to the end of the ages, and he should\nsit and meditate upon the Holy Scriptures, he would not comprehend all the force of the depth of the\nwords. And man cannot rise up to the wisdom of God; as I have written in the tenth discourse. But,\nhowever, the words of all speakers who do not take from the great treasure, are accursed and to be\ndespised. For the image of the king (on his coin) is received wher- ever it goes; but (the coin) in\nwhich there is base metal, is rejected and is not received. And if any one should say, \"These\ndiscourses were spoken by such an one;\" let him carefully learn that to be careful to inquire about\nthe speaker is not commanded him. I also according to my insignificance have written these things, a\nman sprung from Adam, and fashioned by the hands of God, a disciple of the Holy Scriptures.
