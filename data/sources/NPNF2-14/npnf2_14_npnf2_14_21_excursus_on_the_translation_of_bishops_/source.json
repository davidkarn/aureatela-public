The grounds on which such prohibition rested were usually that such changes were the outcome of ambition, and that if tolerated the result would be that smaller and less important sees would be despised, and that there would be a constant temptation to the bishops of such sees to make themselves popular with the important persons in other dioceses with the hope of promotion. Besides this objection to translation, St. Athanasius mentions a spiritual one, that the diocese was the bishop's bride, and that to desert it and take another was an act of unjustifiable divorce, and subsequent adultery.[fn-9-P943_236269:1-nf] Canon XIV. of the Apostolic Canons does not forbid the practice absolutely, but allows it for just cause, and although the Council of Nice is more stringent so far as its words are concerned, apparently forbidding translation under any circumstances, yet, as a matter of fact, that very council did allow and approve a translation.[fn-9-P944_236622:2-nf] The general feeling, however, of the early Church was certainly very strong against all such changes of Episcopal cure, and there can be no doubt that the chief reason why St. Gregory Nazianzen resigned the Presidency of the First Council of Constantinople, was because he had been translated from his obscure see Sasima (not Nazianzum as Socrates and Jerome say) to the Imperial City.[fn-9-P945_237031:3-nf] ","index":"6","references":[{"fn":"9","code":"P943_236269","folder":"NPNF2-14","text":"Athanas.

In this manner, for example, Alexander was translated from Cappadocia to Jerusalem, a translation made, so it is narrated, in obedience to heavenly revelation. It will be noticed that the Nicene Canon does not forbid Provincial Councils to translate bishops, but forbids bishops to translate themselves, and the author of the tract De Translationibus in the Jus Orient. (i. 293, Cit. Haddon. Art. \"Bishop,\" Smith and Cheetham, Dict. Chr. Antiq.) sums up the matter tersely in the statement that h9 meta/basij kekw/lutai, ou0 mh\\n h\\# meta/qesij: i.e., the thing prohibited is \"transmigration\" (which arises from the bishop himself, from selfish motives) not \"translation\" (wherein the will of God and the good of the Church is the ruling cause); the \"going,\" not the \"being taken\" to another see. And this was the practice both of East and West, for many centuries. Roman Catholic writers have tried to prove that translations, at least to the chief sees, required the papal consent, but Thomassinus, considering the case of St. Meletius having translated St. Gregory of Nazianzum to Constantinople, admits that in so doing he \"would only have followed the example of many great bishops of the first ages, when usage had not yet reserved translations to the first see of the Church.\"[fn-9-P949_239726:5-nf] ","index":"8","references":[{"fn":"9","code":"P949_239726","folder":"NPNF2-14","text":"Thomassen, l. cit., Chap LI., §xiij..","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"But the same learned author frankly confesses that in France, Spain, and England, translations were made until the ninth century without consulting the pope at all, by bishops and kings.

The first, when a bishop of marked learning and of equal piety is forced by a council to pass from a small diocese to one far greater where he will be able to do the Church the most important services, as was the case when St. Gregory of Nazianzum was transferred from Sasima to Constantinople, meta/qesij; the second when a bishop, whose see has been laid low by the barbarians, is transferred to another see which is vacant, meta/basij; and the third when a bishop, either having or lacking a see, seizes on a bishopric which is vacant, on his own proper authority a0na/basijit is this last which the Council of Sardica punishes so severely.

Thus we read in the Book of Eastern Law that \"If a Metropolitan with his synod, moved by a praiseworthy cause and probable pretext, shall give his approbation to the translation of a bishop, this can, without doubt, be done, for the good of souls and for the better administration of the church's affairs, etc.\"[fn-9-P954_241886:7-nf] This was adopted at a synod held by the patriarch Manuel at Constantinople, in the presence of the imperial commissioners.","index":"11","references":[{"fn":"9","code":"P954_241886","folder":"NPNF2-14","text":"Juris.
