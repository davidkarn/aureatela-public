These (says he) are read, the other reckoned of the Cenons: Apocryphal books are the invention of heretics.\" To this Johnson appends a note, to wit: \"It is the common opinion of learned men that the reason why some of the ancients reckoned the book of Esther not to belong to the Canon. was the Apocryphal chapters added to it by anotber hand. That The Doctrine of the Apostles is a book now lost, see Dr. Grabe's Essay on this subject.\"","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"As the heretics are quoting apocryphal writings, an evil which was rife even as early as when St. Luke wrote his gospel, therefore I have thought good to set forth clearly what books have been received by us through tradition as belonging to the Canon, and which we believe to be divine. For there are in all twenty-two books of the Old Testament. Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. After this comes Joshua, and Judges, and Ruth. The four books of the Kings, counted as two. Then Chronicles, counted the two as one. Then First and Second Esdras [i.e. Ezra and Nehemiah]. After these Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Cantica. To these follow Job, and the Twelve Prophets, counted as one book. Then Isaiah, Jeremiah together with the Epistle of Baruch, the Lamentations, Ezekiel, and Daniel.","index":"4","references":[]},{"text":"Of the New Testament these are the books [then follows the complete list ending with \"the Apocalypse of John\"].
