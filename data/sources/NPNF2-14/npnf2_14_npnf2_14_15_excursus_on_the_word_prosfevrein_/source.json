But even Clement of Rome presupposes it, when (in cc. 40-44) he draws a parallel between bishops and deacons and the Priests and Levites of the Old Testament, describing as the chief function of the former (44.4) prosfe/rein. This is not the place to enquire whether the first celebration had, in the mind of its founder, the character of a sacrificial meal; but, certainly, the idea, as it was already developed at the time of Justin, had been created by the churches. Various reasons tended towards seeing in the Supper a sacrifice. In the first place, Malachi i. 11, demanded a solemn Christian sacrifice: see my notes on Didache, 14.3. In the second place, all prayers were regarded as a sacrifice, and therefore the solemn prayers at the Supper must be specially considered as such. In the third place, the words of institution tou=to poiei=te, contained a command with regard to a definite religious action. Such an action, however, could only be represented as a sacrifice, and this the more, that the Gentile Christians might suppose that they had to understand poiei=n in the sense of qu/ein. In the fourth place, payments in kind were necessary for the \"agapae\" connected with the Supper, out of which were taken the bread and wine for the Holy celebration; in what other aspect could these offerings in the worship be regarded than as prosforai/ for the purpose of a sacrifice? Yet the spiritual idea so prevailed that only the prayers were regarded as the qusi/a proper, even in the case of Justin (Dial. 117). The elements are only dw=ra, prosforai/, which obtain their value from the prayers, in which thanks are given for the gifts of creation and redemption, as well as for the holy meal, and entreaty is made for the introduction of the community into the Kingdom of God (see Didache, 9. 10). Therefore, even the sacred meal itself is called eu0xaristi/a (Justin, Apol. I. 66: h9 trofh\\ au\\#th kalei=tai par' h9mi=n eu0xaristi/a. Didache, 9. 1: Ignat.), because it is trafh\\ eu0xaristhqei=sa. It is a mistake to suppose that Justin already understood the body of Christ to be the object of poiei=n,[fn-6-P684_157995:2-nf] and therefore thought of a sacrifice of this body (I. 66). The real sacrificial act in the Supper consists rather, according to Justin, only in the eu0xaristi/an poiei=nwhereby thekoino\\j a!rtoj becomes the a!rtoj th=j eu0xaristi/aj.[fn-6-P685_158741:3-nf] The sacrifice of the Supper in its essence, apart from the offering of alms, which in the practice of the Church was closely united with it, is nothing but a sacrifice of prayer: the sacrificial act of the Christian here also is nothing else than an act of prayer (See Apol. I. 14, 65-67; Dial. 28, 29, 41, 70, 116-118).","index":"5","references":[{"fn":"6","code":"P684_157995","folder":"NPNF2-14","text":"Harnack seems to know only the printed (and almost certainly incorrect) reading of the modern texts of the I.
