Think of the absurdity of making a sin of the wax which comes from the ears or of the spittle from the mouth. Moreover we might add many things and explain how the excretions from the belly are necessary to animal life. But if we believe that man is the work of God's hand, as we are taught in holy Scripture, how can it be supposed necessary that we perform anything impure? And if we are the children of God, as the holy Acts of the Apostles teaches, we have in us nothing unclean, etc., etc.\"]; nor is matrimony unclean, though virginity [\"which is angelic and than which nothing can be more excellent\"] is to be preferred before it.","index":"5","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"6","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"7","references":[]}]}]}
