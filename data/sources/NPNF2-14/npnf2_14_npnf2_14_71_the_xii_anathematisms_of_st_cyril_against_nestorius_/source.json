The one that the Emmanuel, that is he who was born of a woman and dwelt with us, is God: the other, that Mary who bare such an one is Mother of God. That Christ is God is clearly proved from the Nicene Creed, and he shews that the same that was in the beginning the Son of God, afterwards took flesh and was born of Mary, without any change or confusion of natures.","index":"15","references":[]},{"text":"St. Cyril explains that by sarkikw=j, carnaliter, he meant nothing else than kata\\ sa/rka, secundum carnem, \"according to the flesh.\" And it was necessary to use this expression to overthrow the perfidy of Nestorius; so that we may understand that the most holy Virgin was the parent not of a simple and bare man, but of God the Word, not in that he was God, but in that he had taken flesh. For God the Father was the parent of the same Son qei>\\kw=j[fn-41-P4193_797773:2-nf] (divinely) as his mother was sarkikw=j (after the flesh). And the word (sarkikw=j) in no degree lessens the dignity of his begetting and bringing forth; for it shews that his flesh was not simulated or shadowed forth; but true and like to ours. Amphilochius distinctly uses the word, saying \"Except he had been born carnally (sarkikw=j), never wouldest thou have been born spiritually (pneumatikw=j).\" Cf. St. Gregory Nazianzen (Orat. 51).","index":"16","references":[{"fn":"41","code":"P4193_797773","folder":"NPNF2-14","text":"This is a late form of Qeiws, but used only in its secondary sense.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"Theodoret misunderstood St. Cyril to teach in this first anathematism that the Word was changed into the flesh he assumed.
