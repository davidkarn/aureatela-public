But the worship of adoration I reserve alone to the supersubstantial and life-giving Trinity. And those who are not so minded, and do not so teach I cast out of the holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, and T smite them with anathema, and I deliver them over to the lot of those who deny the incarnation and the bodily economy of Christ our true God.","index":"4","references":[]},{"text":"\nNotes.","index":"5","references":[]},{"text":"Hefele.","index":"6","references":[]},{"text":"(Hist.
