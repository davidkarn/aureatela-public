And the real identity of Nestorius's view with that of Theodore [of Mopsuestia] was but too plainly exhibited by such statements as occur in some of the extracts preserved in Cyril's treatise Against Nestorius-to the effect that Christ was one with the Word by participation in dignity; that \"the man\" was partaker of Divine power, and in that sense not mere man; that he was adored together with the Word; and that \"My Lord and my God\" was a doxology to the Father; and above all, by the words spoken at Ephesus, \"I can never allow that a child of three months old was God.\"","index":"20","references":[]},{"text":"It is no part of my duty to defend the truth of either the Catholic or Nestorian proposition-each has found many adherents in most ages since it was first started, and probably what is virtually Nestorianism is to-day far more widely held among persons deemed to be orthodox than is commonly supposed.

Such however, is an entire mistake. It was an old term of Catholic Theology, and the very word was used by bishop Alexander in a letter from the synod held at Alexandria in a.d. 320,[fn-42-P4207_803752:4-nf] to condemn the Arian heresy (more than a hundred years before the meeting of the Council of Ephesus); \"After this, we receive the doctrine of the resurrection from the dead, of which Jesus Christ our Lord became the first-fruits; who bore a body in truth, not in semblance, which be derived from Mary the Mother of God (e0k th=j Qeoto/kou Mari/aj). \"[fn-42-P4208_804172:5-nf] The same word had been used by many church writers among whom may be mentioned St. Athanasius, who says, \"As the flesh was born of Mary, the Mother of God, so we say that he, the Word, was himself born of Mary\" (Orat. c. Arian., iij., 14, 29, 33; also iv., 32). See also Eusebius (Vit. Const., iij., 43); St. Cyril of Jerusalem (Cat., x., 9); and especially Origen, who (says Bp. Pearson) \"did not only use, but expound at large the meaning of that title Qeoto/koj in his first tome on the Epistle to the Romans, as Socrates and Liberatus testify.\"[fn-42-P4209_804752:6-nf] (Cf. Origen in Deut. xxii., 23; vol. ij., p. 391. A; in Luc. apud Galland, Bib. Patr., vol. xiv., append., p. 87, D). A list is given by Dr. Routh, in his Reliquioe Sacroe. Vol. ij., p. 215 (1st Ed.), 332 (2d Ed.).In fact Theodore of Mopsuestia was the first to object to it, so far as we know, writing as follows: \"Mary bare Jesus, not the Word, for the Word was and remained omnipresent, although from the beginning he dwelt in Jesus in a peculiar manner. Thus Mary is properly the Mother of Christ (Christotocos) but not the mother of God (Theotocos). Only figuratively, per anaphoram, can she be called Theotocos also, because God was in Christ in a remarkable manner. Properly she bare a man, in whom the union with the Word was begun, but was still so little completed, that he was not yet called the Son of God.\" And in another place he says: \"It is madness to say that God is born of the Virgin. ... Not God, butthe temple in which God dwelt, is born of Mary.\"[fn-42-P4210_805774:7-nf] How far Theodore had departed from the teaching of the Apostolic days may be seen by the following quotations from St. Ignatius. \"There is one only physician, of flesh and spirit, generate and ingenerate, God in man, true Life in death, Son of Mary and of God, first passible and then impassible, Jesus Christ our Lord.\"[fn-42-P4211_806166:8-nf] Further on in the same epistle he says: \"For our God, Jesus the Christ, was borne in the womb by Mary etc.\"[fn-42-P4212_806300:9-nf] With the first of these passages Bp. Light-foot very aptly compares the following from Melito. \"Since he was incorporeal, he fashioned a body for himself of our likeness ... he was carried by Mary and clothed by his Father, he trod the earth and he filled the heavens.\"[fn-42-P4213_806587:10-nf] ","index":"24","references":[{"fn":"42","code":"P4207_803752","folder":"NPNF2-14","text":"The date is not certain, it may have been a year or so different.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"42","code":"P4208_804172","folder":"NPNF2-14","text":"Theod., Hist.

This point has been settled by the unvarying use of the whole Church of God throughout all the ages from that day to this, but there is, or at least some persons have thought that there was, some question as to how Theotocos should be translated into English.Throughout this volume I have translated it \"Mother of God,\" and I propose giving my reasons for considering this the only accurate translation of the word, both from a lexico-graphical and from a theological point of view.","index":"31","references":[]},{"text":"(a) It is evident that the word is a composite formed of Qeo\\j = God, and ti/ktein = to be the mother of a child.

Of course the answer to the objection in each case is the same, it is not of the Godhead that Mary is the Mother, but of the Incarnate Son, who is God. \"Mother\" expresses exactly the relation to the incarnate Son which St. Cyril, the Council of Ephesus, and all succeeding, not to say also preceding, ages of Catholics, rightly or wrongly, ascribe to Mary. All that every child derives from its Mother that God the Son derived from Mary, and this without the co-operation of any man, but by the direct operation of the Holy Ghost, so that in a fuller, truer, and more perfect sense, Mary is the Mother of God the Son in his incarnation, than any other earthly mother is of her son.","index":"36","references":[]},{"text":"I therefore consider it certain that no scholar who can and will divest himself of theological bias, can doubt that \"Mother of God\" is the most accurate translation of the term Theotocos.","index":"37","references":[]},{"text":"\nII.","index":"38","references":[]},{"text":"IF anyone shall not confess that the Word of God the Father is united hypostatically to flesh, and that with that flesh of his own, he is one only Christ both God and man at the same time: let him be anathema.","index":"39","references":[]},{"text":"\nNotes.","index":"40","references":[]},{"text":"Nestorius.","index":"41","references":[]},{"text":"II.","index":"42","references":[]},{"text":"If any one asserts that, at the union of the Logos with the flesh, the divine Essence moved from one place to another; or says that the flesh is capable of receiving the divine nature, and that it has been partially united with the flesh; or ascribes to the flesh, by reason of its reception of God, an extension to the infinite and boundless, and says that God and man are one and the same in nature; let him be anathema.","index":"43","references":[]},{"text":"\nIII.","index":"44","references":[]},{"text":"IF anyone shah after the [hypostatic] union divide the hypostases in the one Christ, joining them by that connexion alone, which happens according to worthiness, or even authority and power, and not rather by a coming together (suno/dw), which is made by natural union (e\\#nwsin fusikh\\n): let him be anathema.","index":"45","references":[]},{"text":"\nNotes.","index":"46","references":[]},{"text":"Nestorius.","index":"47","references":[]},{"text":"III.","index":"48","references":[]},{"text":"If any one says that Christ, who is also Emmanuel, is One, not [merely] in consequence of connection, but [also] in nature, and does not acknowledge the connection (suna/feia) of the two natures, that of the Logos and of the assumed manhood, in one Son, as still continuing without mingling; let him be anathema.","index":"49","references":[]},{"text":"Hefele.","index":"50","references":[]},{"text":"(Hist. of the Coucn., Vol. III., p. 7.)","index":"51","references":[]},{"text":"Theodore [of Mopsuestia, and in this he was followed by Nestorius,] (and here is his fundamental error,) not merely maintained the existence of two natures in Christ, but of two persons, as, he says himself, no subsistence can be thought of as perfect without personality.
