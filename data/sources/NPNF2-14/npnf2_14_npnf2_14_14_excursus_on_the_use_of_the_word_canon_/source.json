See Westcott's account of it, On the New Testament Canon, p. 498 if. The original sense, \"a straight rod\" or \"line,\" determines all its religious applications, which begin with St. Paul's use of it for a prescribed sphere of apostolic work (2 Cor. x. 13, 15), or a regulative principle of Christian life (Gal. vi. 16). It represents the element of definiteness in Christianity and in the order of the Christian Church. Clement of Rome uses it for the measure of Christian attainment (Ep. Cor. 7). Irenaeus calls the baptismal creed \"the canon of truth\" (i. 9, 4): Polycrates (Euseb. v. 24) and probably Hippolytus (ib. v. 28) calls it \"the canon of faith;\" the Council of Antioch in a.d. 269, referring to the same standard of orthodox belief, speaks with significant absoluteness of \"the canon\" (ib. vii. 30). Eusebius himself mentions \"the canon of truth\" in iv. 23, and \"the canon of the preaching\" in iii. 32; and so Basil speaks of \"the transmitted canon of true religion\" (Epist. 204-6). Such language, like Tertullian's \"regula fidei,\" amounted to saying, \"We Christians know what we believe: it is not a vague `idea' without substance or outline: it can be put into form, and by it we `test the spirits whether they be of God.'\" Thus it was natural for Socrates to call the Nicene Creed itself a \"canon,\" ii. 27. Clement of Alexandria uses the phrase \"canon of truth\" for a standard of mystic interpretation, but proceeds to call the harmony between the two Testaments \"a canon for the Church,\" Strom. vi. 15, 124, 125. Eusebius speaks of \"the ecclesiastical canon\" which recognized no other Gospels than the four (vi. 25). The use of the term and its cognates in reference to the Scriptures is explained by Westcott in a passive sense so that \"canonized\" books, as Athanasius calls them (Fest. Ep. 39), are books expressly recognized by the Church as portions of Holy Scripture. Again, as to matters of observance, Clement of Alexandria wrote a book against Judaizers, called \"The Churches Canon\" (Euseb. vi. 13); and Cornelius of Rome, in his letter to Fabius, speaks of the \"canon\" as to what we call confirmation (Euseb. vi. 43), and Dionysius of the \"canon\" as to reception of converts from heresy (ib, vii. 7). The Nicene Council in this canon refers to a standing \"canon\" of discipline (comp. Nic. 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 16, 18), but it does not apply the term to its own enactments, which are so described in the second canon of Constantinople (see below), and of which Socrates says \"that it passed what are usually called `canons'\" (i. 13); as Julius of Rome calls a decree of this Council a \"canon\" (Athan. Apol. c. Ari. 25); so Athanasius applies the term generally to Church laws (Encycl. 2; cp. Apol. c. Ari. 69). The use of kanw\\n for the clerical body (Nic. 16, 17, 19; Chalc. 2) is explained by Westcott with reference to the rule of clerical life, but Bingham traces it to the roll or official list on which the names of clerics were enrolled (i. 5, 10); and this appears to be the more natural derivation, see \"the holy canon\" in the first canon of the Council of Antioch, and compare Socrates (i. 17), \"the Virgins enumerated e0n tw=| tw=n e0kklhsiw=n kano/ni,\" and (ib. v. 19) on the addition of a penitentiary \"to the canon of the church;\" see also George of Laodicea in Sozomon, iv. 13. Hence any cleric might be called kanoniko/j, see Cyril of Jerusalem, Procatech. 4; so we read of \"canonical singers.\" Laodicea, canon xv. The same notion of definiteness appears in the ritual use of the word for a series of nine \"odes\" in the Eastern Church service (Neale, Introd. East. Ch. if. 832), for the central and unvarying element in the Liturgy, beginning after theTersanctus (Hammond, Liturgies East and West, p. 377); or for any Church office (Ducange in v.); also in its application to a table for the calculation of Easter (Euseb. vi. 29; vii. 32); to a scheme for exhibiting the common and peculiar parts of the several Gospels (as the \"Eusebian canons\") and to a prescribed or ordinary payment to a church, a use which grew out of one found in Athanasius' Apol. c. Ari. 60.","index":"11","references":[]},{"text":"In more recent times a tendency has appeared to restrict the term Canon to matters of discipline, but the Council of Treat continued the ancient use of the word, calling its doctrinal and disciplinary determinations alike \"Canons.\"","index":"12","references":[]},{"text":"\nCanon II.","index":"13","references":[]},{"text":"Forasmuch as, either from necessity, or through the urgency of individuals, many things have been done contrary to the Ecclesiastical canon, so that men just converted from heathenism to the faith, and who have been instructed but a little while, are straightway brought to the spiritual layer, and as soon as they have been baptized, are advanced to the episcopate or the presbyterate, it has seemed right to us that for the time to come no such thing shall be done. For to the catechumen himself there is need of time and of a longer trial after baptism. For the apostolical saying is clear, \"Not a novice; lest, being lifted up with pride, he fall into condemnation and the snare of the devil.\" But if, as time goes on, any sensual sin should be found out about the person, and he should be convicted by two or three witnesses, let him cease from the clerical office.

There have been, nevertheless, certain cases in which, for urgent reasons, an exception has been made to the rule of the Council of Nicaea-for instance, that of S. Ambrose. The canon of Nicaea does not seem to allow such an exception, but it might be justified by the apostolical canon, which says, at the close: \"It is not right that any one who has not yet been proved should be a teacher of others, unless by a peculiar divine grace.\" The expression of the canon of Nicaea, yukiko\\n ti a9ma/rthma, is not easy to explain: some render it by the Latin words animale peccatam, believing that the Council has here especially in view sins of the flesh; but as Zonaras has said, all sins are yukika\\ a9marth/mata.

This is, I believe, the general sense of the canon, and of this passage in particular: \"Henceforward no one shall be baptized or ordained quickly. As to those already in orders (without any distinction between those who have been ordained in due course and those who have been ordained too quickly), the rule is that they shall be de posed if they commit a serious offence. Those who are guilty of disobedience to this great Synod, either by allowing themselves to be ordained or even by ordaining others prematurely, are threatened with deposition ipso facto, and for this fault alone.\" We consider, in short, that the last words of the canon may be understood as well of the ordained as of the ordainer.","index":"21","references":[]},{"text":"\nCanon III.","index":"22","references":[]},{"text":"The great Synod has stringently forbidden any bishop, presbyter, deacon, or any one of the clergy whatever, to have a subintroducta dwelling with him, except only a mother, or sister, or aunt, or such persons only as are beyond all suspicion.","index":"23","references":[]},{"text":"\nNotes.","index":"24","references":[]},{"text":"Ancient Epitome of Canon III.","index":"25","references":[]},{"text":"No one shall have a woman in his house except his mother, and sister, and persons altogether beyond suspicion.","index":"26","references":[]},{"text":"Justellus.","index":"27","references":[]},{"text":"Who these mulieres subintroductae were does not sufficiently appear . . . but they were neither wives nor concubines, but women of some third kind, which the clergy kept with them, not for the sake of offspring or lust, but from the desire, or certainly under the pretence, of piety.","index":"28","references":[]},{"text":"Johnson.","index":"29","references":[]},{"text":"For want of a proper English word to render it by, I translate \"to retain any woman in their houses under pretence of her being a disciple to them.\"","index":"30","references":[]},{"text":"Van Espen","index":"31","references":[]},{"text":"Translates: And his sisters and aunts cannot remain unless they be free from all suspicion.","index":"32","references":[]},{"text":"Fuchs in his Bibliothek der kirchenver sammlungen confesses that this canon shews that the practice of clerical celibacy had already spread widely.
