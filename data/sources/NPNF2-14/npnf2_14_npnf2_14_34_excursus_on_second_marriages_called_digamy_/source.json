I cite a portion of an admirable article upon the subject by an English barrister of Lincoln's Inn.","index":"16","references":[]},{"text":"(J. M. Ludlow, in Smith and Cheetham, Dictionary of Christian Antiquities, sub voce Digamy.) Although among the earlier Romans[fn-17-P1708_373458:3-nf] there was one form of marriage which was indissoluble, viz., that by confarreatio, still generally a second marriage either after death or divorce was by no means viewed with disfavour.Meanwhile an intensifying spirit of asceticism was leading many in the Church to a condemnation of second marriage in all eases. Minucius Felix (Octavius, c. 31,5) only professes on behalf of the Christians a preference for monogamy. Clement of Alexandria (a.d. 150-220) seems to confine the term marriage to the first lawful union (Stromata, Bk. ii.).... It would seem, however, that when these views were carried to the extent of absolute prohibition of second marriages generally by several heretical sects, the Montanists (see Augustine, De Hoeresibus, c. xxvi.), the Cathari (ib., c. xxxviii.), and a portion at least of the Novatianists (see Cotel., Patr. Apol., vol. i., p. 91, n. 16) the Church saw the necessity of not fixing such a yoke on the necks of the laity. The forbiddance of second marriage, or its assimilation to fornication, was treated as one of the marks of heresy (Augustin. u. s.; and see also his De Bono Vid., c. vi.). The sentiment of Augustine (in the last referred to passage) may be taken to express the Church's judgment at the close of the fourth century: \"Second marriages are not to be condemned, but had in less honour,\" and see also Epiphanius, in his Exposition of the Catholic Faith.","index":"17","references":[{"fn":"17","code":"P1708_373458","folder":"NPNF2-14","text":"The reader may recall the words of Dido: Ille meos. primusqui me sibi junxit, amores Abstulit; ille habeat secum servetque sepulcro.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"To these remarks of Mr. Ludlow's, I may add that St. Ambrose had written (De Viduis, c. xi.), \"We do not prohibit second marriages, but we do not approve marriages frequently reiterated.\" St. Jerome had spoken still more strongly (Ep. lxvii., Apol. pro libris adv. Jovin.), \"I do not condemn digamists, or even trigamists or, if such a thing can be said, octagamists.\" It does not seem that the penance which was imposed in the East upon those entering into second nuptials was imposed in the West. The Corpus Juris Canonici contains two decretals, one of Alexander III. and another of Urban III., forbidding priests to give the nuptial benediction in cases of reiterated marriage. In the East at second marriages the benediction of the crown is omitted and \"propitiatory prayers\" are to be said. Mr. Ludlow points out that in the \"Sanctions and Decrees,\" falsely attributed to the Council of Nice and found in Mansi (vol. ii., col. 1029) it is expressly stated that widowers and widows may marry, but that \"the blessing of the crowns is not to be imparted to them, for this is only once given, at first marriages, and is not to be repeated. ... But if one of them be not a widower or widow, let such one alone receive the benediction with the paranymphs, those whom he will.\"","index":"18","references":[]},{"text":"\nCanon XX.","index":"19","references":[]},{"text":"IF the wife of anyone has committed adultery or if any man commit adultery it seems fit that he shall be restored to full communion after seven years passed in the prescribed degrees [of penance].","index":"20","references":[]},{"text":"\nNotes.","index":"21","references":[]},{"text":"Ancient Epitome of Canon XX.","index":"22","references":[]},{"text":"An adulteress and an adulterer are to be cut off for seven years.","index":"23","references":[]},{"text":"Hefele.","index":"24","references":[]},{"text":"The simplest explanation of this canon is \"that the man or woman who has violated the marriage bond shall undergo a seven years' penance\"; but many reject this explanation, because the text says au0to\\n tu/kein and consequently can refer only to the husband. Fleury and Routh think the canon speaks, as does the seventieth of Elvira, of a woman who has broken the marriage tie with the knowledge and consent of her husband. The husband would therefore in this case be punished for this permission, just as if he had himself committed adultery. Van Espen has given another explanation: \"That he who marries a woman already divorced for adultery is as criminal as if he had himself committed adultery.\" But this explanation appears to us more forced than that already given; and we think that the Greek commentators Balsamon and Zonaras were right in giving the explanation we have offered first as the most natural. They think that the Synod punished every adulterer, whether man or woman, by a seven years' penance. There is no reason for making a mistake because only the word au0to\\n occurs in the passage in which the penalty is fixed; for au0to\\n here means the guilty party, and applies equally to the woman and the man: besides, in the preceding canon the masculine o\\#soi e0paggello/menoi includes young men and young women also. It is probable that the Trullan Synod of 692, in forming its eighty-seventh canon, had in view the twentieth of Ancyra. The sixty-ninth canon of Elvira condemned to a lighter punishment-only five years of penance-him who had been only once guilty of adultery.","index":"25","references":[]},{"text":"\nCanon XXI.","index":"26","references":[]},{"text":"Concerning women who commit fornication, and destroy that which they have conceived, or who are employed in making drugs for abortion, a former decree excluded them until the hour of death, and to this some have assented.
