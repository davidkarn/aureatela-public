With regard to the date, there can be no doubt that it was after Nice and before the First Council of Constantinople, that is between 325 and 381. Socrates[fn-20-P2046_409951:1-nf] seems to place it about 365; but Sozomen[fn-20-P2047_410032:2-nf] some twenty years earlier. On the other hand, Remi Ceillier[fn-20-P2048_410131:3-nf] inconsistently with his other statements, seems to argue from St. Basil's letters that the true date is later than 376. Still another theory has been urged by the Ballerini, resting on the supposition that the Eusebius who presided was Eusebius of Caesarea, and they therefore fix the date between 362 and 370. With this Mr. Ffoulkes agrees, and fixes the date,[fn-20-P2049_410564:4-nf] with Pagi, at 358, and is bold enough to add, \"and this was unquestionably the year of the Council.\" But in the old collections of canons almost without exception, the canons of Gangra precede those of Antioch, and Blondel and TilIemont[fn-20-P2050_410879:5-nf] have sustained this, which perhaps I may call the traditional date.","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"20","code":"P2046_409951","folder":"NPNF2-14","text":"Socrat.

There does not seem to be any reasonable ground to doubt that the person condemned, Eustathius by name, was the famous bishop of Sebaste. This may be gathered from both Sozomen[fn-20-P2052_411226:6-nf] and Socrates,[fn-20-P2053_411268:7-nf] and is confirmed incidentally by one of St. Basil's epistles,[fn-20-P2054_411360:8-nf] Moreover, Eustathius's See of Sebaste is in Armenia, and it is to the bishops of Armenia that the Synod addresses its letter. It would seem in view of all this that Bp. Hefele's words are not too severe when he writes, \"Under such circumstances the statement of Baronius, Du Pin, and others (supported by no single ancient testimony) that another Eustathius, or possibly the monk Eutactus, is here meant, deserves no serious consideration, though Tillemont did not express himself as opposed to it\"[fn-20-P2055_411889:9-nf] ","index":"4","references":[{"fn":"20","code":"P2052_411226","folder":"NPNF2-14","text":"Sozom.

As to who was the president, it seems tolerably certain that his name was Eusebius-if Sozomen[fn-20-P2059_412639:11-nf] indeed means it was \"Eusebius of Constantinople,\" it is a blunder, yet he had the name right. In the heading of the Synodal letter Eusebius is first named, and as Gangra and Armenia were within the jurisdiction of Caesarea, it certainly would seem natural to suppose that the Eusebius named was the Metropolitan of that province, but it must be remembered that Eusebius of Cappadocia was not made bishop until 362, four years after Mr. Ffoulkes makes him preside at Gangra. The names of thirteen bishops are given in the Greek text.","index":"6","references":[{"fn":"20","code":"P2059_412639","folder":"NPNF2-14","text":"Sozomen. H. E., Lib.

It seems also clear that by the beginning of the sixth century the Synod of Gangra was looked upon at Rome as having been held under papal authority; Pope Symmachus expressly saying so to the Roman Synod of 504.
