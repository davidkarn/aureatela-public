Lord Russell made the learned divine a canon of Westminster Abbey, and the critical Chevalier Bunsen[fn-24-P2450_403422:68-nf] committed himself as its patron. To the credit of the learned, in general, the work was gratefully received, and studied with scientific conscientiousness by Lightfoot and others. The literature of this period is valuable; and the result is decisive as to the Curetonian versions at least, which are fragmentary and abridged, and yet they are a valuable contribution to the study of the whole case.","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"24","code":"P2450_403422","folder":"ANF-01","text":"See the extraordinary passage and note in his Hippolytus, vol. i. p. 58, etc.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"The following is the original Introductory Notice:-","index":"4","references":[]},{"text":"Some account of the discovery of the Syriac version of the Ignatian Epistles has been already given. We have simply to add here a brief description of the mss. from which the Syriac text has been printed. That which is named a by Cureton, contains only the Epistle to Polycarp, and exhibits the text of that Epistle which, after him, we have followed. He fixes its age somewhere in the first half of the sixth century, or before the year 550. The second ms., which Cureton refers to as b, is assigned by him to the seventh or eighth century. It contains the three Epistles of Ignatius, and furnishes the text here followed in the Epistles to the Ephesians and Romans. The third ms., which Cureton quotes as g, has no date, but, as he tells us, \"belonged to the collection acquired by Moses of Nisibis in a.d. 931, and was written apparently about three or four centuries earlier.\" It contains the three Epistles to Polycarp, the Ephesians, and the Romans. The text of all these mss. is in several passages manifestly corrupt, and the translators appear at times to have mistaken the meaning of the Greek original.","index":"5","references":[]},{"text":"[N.B.-Bunsen is forced to allow the fact that the discovery of the lost work of Hippolytus \"throws new light on an obscure point of the Ignatian controversy,\" i.e., the Sige in the Epistle to the Magnesians (cap. viii.); but his treatment of the matter is unworthy of a candid scholar.]  ","index":"6","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"7","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"8","references":[]}]}]}
