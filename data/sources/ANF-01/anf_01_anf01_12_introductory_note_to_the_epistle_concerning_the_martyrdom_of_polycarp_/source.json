As an encyclical of one of \"the seven churches\" to another of the same Seven, and as bearing witness to their aggregation with others into the unity of \"the Holy and Catholic Church,\" it is a very interesting witness, not only to an article of the creed, but to the original meaning and acceptation of the same. More than this, it is evidence of the strength of Christ perfected in human weakness; and thus it affords us an assurance of grace equal to our day in every time of need. When I see in it, however, an example of what a noble army of martyrs, women and children included, suffered in those days \"for the testimony of Jesus,\" and in order to hand down the knowledge of the Gospel to these boastful ages of our own, I confess myself edified by what I read, chiefly because I am humbled and abashed in comparing what a Christian used to be, with what a Christian is, in our times, even at his best estate.","index":"3","references":[]},{"text":"That this s1.v1.a3.w2 has been interpolated can hardly be doubted, when we compare it with the unvarnished specimen, in Eusebius. As for the \"fragrant smell\" that came from the fire, many kinds of wood emit the like in burning; and, apart from Oriental warmth of colouring, there seems nothing incredible in the narrative if we except \"the dove\" (chap. xvi.), which, however, is probably a corrupt reading,[fn-9-P904_164241:83-nf] as suggested by our translators. The blade was thrust into the martyr's Left Side; and this, opening the heart, caused the outpouring of a flood, and not a mere trickling. But, though Greek thus amended is a plausible conjecture, there seems to have been nothing of the kind in the copy quoted by Eusebius. On the other hand, note the truly catholic and scriptural testimony: \"We love the martyrs, but the Son of God we worship: it is impossible for us to worship any other.\"","index":"4","references":[{"fn":"9","code":"P904_164241","folder":"ANF-01","text":"See an ingenious conuecture in Bishop Wordsworth's Hippolytus and the Church of Rome, p. 318, C.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"Bishop Jacobson assigns more than fifty pages to this martyrology, with a Latin version and abundant notes.

It is the earliest of all the Martyria, and has generally been accounted both the most interesting and authentic. Not a few, however, deem it interpolated in several passages, and some refer it to a much later date than the middle of the second century, to which it has been commonly ascribed. We cannot tell how much it may owe to the writers (chap. xxii.) who successively transcribed it. Great part of it has been engrossed by Eusebius in his Ecclesiastical History (iv. 15); and it is instructive to observe, that some of the most startling miraculous phenomena recorded in the text as it now stands, have no place in the narrative as given by that early historian of the Church. Much discussion has arisen respecting several particulars contained in this Martyrium; but into these disputes we do not enter, having it for our aim simply to present the reader with as faithful a translation as possible of this very interesting monument of Christian antiquity.
