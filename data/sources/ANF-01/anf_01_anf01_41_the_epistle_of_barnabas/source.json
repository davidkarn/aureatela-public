The final stumbling-block (or source of danger) approaches, concerning which it is written, as Enoch[fn-31-P3170_530008:26-nf] says, \"For for this end the Lord has cut short the times and the days, that His Beloved may hasten; and He will come to the inheritance.\" And the prophet also speaks thus: \"Ten kingdoms shall reign upon the earth, and a little king shall rise up after them, who shall subdue under one three of the kings.[fn-31-P3171_530386:27-nf] In like manner Daniel says concerning the same, \"And I beheld the fourth beast, wicked and powerful, and more savage than all the beasts of the earth, and how from it sprang up ten horns, and out of them a little budding horn, and how it subdued under one three of the great horns.\"[fn-31-P3172_530709:28-nf] Ye ought therefore to understand.

That the Black One[fn-31-P3179_532996:35-nf] may find no means of entrance, let us flee from every vanity, let us utterly hate the works of the way of wickedness. Do not, by retiring apart, live a solitary life, as if you were already [fully] justified; but coming together in one place, make common inquiry concerning what tends to your general welfare.

As much as in us lies, let us meditate upon the fear of God, and let us keep His commandments, that we may rejoice in His ordinances. The Lord will judge the world without respect of persons. Each will receive as he has done: if he is righteous, his righteousness will precede him; if he is wicked, the reward of wickedness is before him. Take heed, lest resting at our ease, as those who are the called [of God], we should fall asleep in our sins, and the wicked prince, acquiring power over us, should thrust us away from the kingdom of the Lord. And all the more attend to this, my brethren, when ye reflect and behold, that after so great signs and wonders were wrought in Israel, they were thus [at length] abandoned.

Moreover, teaching Israel, and doing so great miracles and signs, He preached [the truth] to him, and greatly loved him.

Moreover, when fixed to the cross, He had given Him to drink vinegar and gall. Hearken how the priests of the people[fn-32-P3237_545504:84-nf] gave previous indications of this. His commandment having been written, the Lord enjoined, that whosoever did not keep the fast should be put to death, because He also Himself was to offer in sacrifice for our sins the vessel of the Spirit, in order that the type established in Isaac when he was offered upon the altar might be fully accomplished. What, then, says He in the prophet? \"And let them eat of the goat which is offered, with fasting, for all their sins.\"[fn-32-P3238_546035:85-nf] Attend carefully: \"And let all the priests alone eat the inwards, unwashed with vinegar.\" Wherefore? Because to me, who am to offer my flesh for the sins of my new people, ye are to give gall with vinegar to drink: eat ye alone, while the people fast and mourn in sackcloth and ashes.

Moreover, the Lord saith to them in Deuteronomy, \"And I will establish my ordinances among this people.\"[fn-32-P3295_556628:133-nf] Is there then not a command of God they should not eat [these things]? There is, but Moses spoke with a spiritual reference.[fn-32-P3296_556773:134-nf] For this reason he named the swine, as much as to say, \"Thou shalt not join thyself to men who resemble swine.\" For when they live in pleasure, they forget their Lord; but when they come to want, they acknowledge the Lord. And [in like manner] the swine, when it has eaten, does not recognize its master; but when hungry it cries out, and on receiving food is quiet again. \"Neither shalt thou eat,\" says he \"the eagle, nor the hawk, nor the kite, nor the raven.\" \"Thou shalt not join thyself,\" he means, \"to such men as know not how to procure food for themselves by labour and sweat, but seize on that of others in their iniquity, and although wearing an aspect of simplicity, are on the watch to plunder others.\"[fn-32-P3297_557519:135-nf] So these birds, while they sit idle, inquire how they may devour the flesh of others, proving themselves pests [to all] by their wickedness. \"And thou shalt not eat,\" he says, \"the lamprey, or the polypus, or the cuttlefish.\" He means, \"Thou shalt not join thyself or be like to such men as are ungodly to the end, and are condemned[fn-32-P3298_558154:136-nf] to death.\" In like manner as those fishes, above accursed, float in the deep, not swimming [on the surface] like the rest, but make their abode in the mud which lies at the bottom. Moreover, \"Thou shall not,\" he says, \"eat the hare.\" Wherefore? \"Thou shall not be a corrupter of boys, nor like unto such.\"[fn-32-P3299_558503:137-nf] Because the hare multiplies, year by year, the places of its conception; for as many years as it lives so many[fn-33-P3300_558906:138-nf] it has. Moreover, \"Thou shall not eat the hyena.\" He means, \"Thou shall not be an adulterer, nor a corrupter, nor be like to them that are such.\" Wherefore? Because that animal annually changes its sex, and is at one time male, and at another female. Moreover, he has rightly detested the weasel. For he means, \"Thou shalt not be like to those whom we hear of as committing wickedness with the mouth,[fn-33-P3301_559380:139-nf] on account of their uncleanness; nor shall thou be joined to those impure women who commit iniquity with the mouth. For this animal conceives by the mouth.\" Moses then issued[fn-33-P3302_559647:140-nf] three doctrines concerning meats with a spiritual significance; but they received them according to fleshly desire, as if he had merely spoken of [literal] meats. David, however, comprehends the knowledge of the three doctrines, and speaks in like manner: \"Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly,\"[fn-33-P3303_560020:141-nf] even as the fishes [referred to] go in darkness to the depths [of the sea]; \"and hath not stood in the way of sinners,\" even as those who profess to fear the Lord, but go astray like swine; \"and hath not sat in the seat of scorners,\"[fn-33-P3304_560271:142-nf] even as those birds that lie in wait for prey. Take a full and firm grasp of this spiritual[fn-33-P3305_560401:143-nf] knowledge. But Moses says still further, \"Ye shall eat every animal that is cloven-footed and ruminant.\" What does he mean? [The ruminant animal denotes him] who, on receiving food, recognizes Him that nourishes him, and being satisfied by Him,[fn-33-P3306_560843:144-nf] is visibly made glad. Well spake [Moses], having respect to the commandment. What, then, does he mean? That we ought to join ourselves to those that fear the Lord, those who meditate in their heart on the commandment which they have received, those who both utter the judgments of the Lord and observe them, those who know that meditation is a work of gladness, and who ruminate[fn-33-P3307_561254:145-nf] upon the word of the Lord. But what means the cloven-footed? That the righteous man also walks in this world, yet looks forward to the holy state[fn-33-P3308_561461:146-nf] [to come]. Behold how well Moses legislated. But how was it possible for them to understand or comprehend these things? We then, rightly understanding his commandments,[fn-33-P3309_561660:147-nf] explain them as the Lord intended.

Moreover Moses, when he commanded, \"Ye shall not have any graven or molten [image] for your God,\"[fn-33-P3341_567929:173-nf] did so that he might reveal a type of Jesus. Moses then makes a brazen serpent, and places it upon a beam,[fn-33-P3342_568097:174-nf] and by proclamation assembles the people. When, therefore, they were come together, they besought Moses that he would offer sacrifice[fn-33-P3343_568356:175-nf] in their behalf, and pray for their recovery. And Moses spake unto them, saying, \"When any one of you is bitten, let him come to the serpent placed on the pole; and let him hope and believe, that even though dead, it is able to give him life, and immediately he shall be restored.\"[fn-33-P3344_568691:176-nf] And they did so. Thou hast in this also [an indication of] the glory of Jesus; for in Him and to Him are all things.[fn-33-P3345_568828:177-nf] What, again, says Moses to Jesus (Joshua) the son of Nave, when he gave him[fn-33-P3346_568929:178-nf] this name, as being a prophet, with this view only, that all the people might hear that the Father would reveal all things concerning His Son Jesus to the son[fn-33-P3347_569169:179-nf] of Nave? This name then being given him when he sent him to spy out the land, he said, \"Take a book into thy hands, and write what the Lord declares, that the Son of God will in the last days cut off from the roots all the house of Amalek.\"[fn-33-P3348_569505:180-nf] Behold again: Jesus who was manifested, both by type and in the flesh,[fn-33-P3349_569597:181-nf] is not the Son of man, but the Son of God. Since, therefore, they were to say that Christ was the son[fn-33-P3350_569728:182-nf] of David, fearing and understanding the error of the wicked, he saith, \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit at My right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\"[fn-33-P3351_569965:183-nf] And again, thus saith Isaiah, \"The Lord said to Christ,[fn-33-P3352_570058:184-nf] my Lord, whose right hand I have holden,[fn-33-P3353_570145:185-nf] that the nations should yield obedience before Him; and I will break in pieces the strength of kings.\"[fn-33-P3354_570291:186-nf] Behold how David calleth Him Lord and the Son of God.","index":"48","references":[{"fn":"33","code":"P3330_565437","folder":"ANF-01","text":"Cod.
