Korah also,[fn-14-P1446_256008:27-nf] and the two hundred and fifty who conspired with him against Aaron, were destroyed by fire. Absalom, again,[fn-14-P1447_256135:28-nf] who had slain his brother, became suspended on a tree, and had his evil-designing heart thrust through with darts. In like manner was Abeddadan[fn-14-P1448_256302:29-nf] beheaded for the same reason. Uzziah,[fn-14-P1449_256402:30-nf] when he presumed to oppose the priests and the priesthood, was smitten with leprosy. Saul also was dishonoured,[fn-14-P1450_256538:31-nf] because he did not wait for Samuel the high priest.
