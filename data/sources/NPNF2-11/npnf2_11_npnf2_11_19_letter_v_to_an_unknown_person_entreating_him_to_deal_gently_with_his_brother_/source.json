For let it be granted that a youthful fault and error of a yet unsettled age has injured him, so as to inflict a stare on his early years; still one, who did not yet know what was due to right conduct, has gone wrong almost without contracting blame. For when he came to a fight state of mind and to reflection, he understood on better thoughts that a theatrical life was to be condemned. However, he could not be completely cleared of his fault, unless he should wash its guilt away by the aid[fn-8-P882_349610:2-nf] of Deity, since, by the remedy obtained through the Catholic religion, changing his views, he has denied himself the enjoyment of a less honorable place, and has withdrawn himself from the eyes of the people.OF The Master AS Above.[fn-8-P883_349928:3-nf] ","index":"2","references":[{"fn":"8","code":"P881_348899","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"\"divinitatis accessu\": the context is almost unintelligible.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"8","code":"P882_349610","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"This probably denotes that what follows is the substance of the Master's petition.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"8","code":"P883_349928","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Clericus, while accepting most of the letters with which we are now dealing, doubts, from the difference of style, whether this is an epistle of Sulpitius.
