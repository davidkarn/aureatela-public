For we can show that at the third hour the Holy Spirit, who had been of old promised by the prophets, descended in the first instance on the Apostles assembled together for prayer. For when in their astonishment at the speaking with tongues, which proceeded from them throughthe outpouring of the Holy Ghost upon them, the unbelieving people of the Jews mocked and said that they were full of new wine, then Peter, standing up in the midst of them, said: \"Men of Israel, and all ye who dwell at Jerusalem, let this be known unto you, and consider my words. For these men are not, as ye imagine, drunk, since it is the third hour of the day; but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel: and it shall come to pass in the last days, saith the Lord, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams. And indeed upon my servants and my handmaids in those days I will pour out of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.\"[fn-21-P2128_916267:5-nf] And all of this was fulfilled at the third hour, when the Holy Spirit, announced before by the prophets, came at that hour and abode upon the Apostles. But at the sixth hour the spotless Sacrifice, our Lord and Saviour, was offered up to the Father, and, ascending the cross for the salvation of the whole world, made atonement for the sins of mankind, and, despoiling principalities and powers, led them away openly; and all of us who were liable to death and bound by the debt of the handwriting that could not be paid, He freed, by taking it away out of the midst and affixing it to His cross for a trophy,[fn-21-P2129_916896:6-nf] At the same hour, too, to Peter,in an ecstasy of mind, there was divinely revealed both the calling of the Gentiles by the letting down of the Gospel vessel from heaven, and also the cleansing of all the living creatures contained in it, when a voice came to him and said to him: \"Rise, Peter; kill and eat; \"[fn-21-P2130_917522:7-nf] which vessel, let down from heaven by the four corners, is plainly seen to signify nothing else than the Gospel. For although, as it is divided by the fourfold narrative of the Evangelists, it seems to have \"four corners\" (or beginnings), yet the body of the Gospel is but one; embracing, as it does, the birth as well as the Godhead, and the miracles as well as the passion of one and the same Christ. Excellently, too, it says not \"of linen\" but \"as if of linen.\" For linen signifies death. Since, then, our Lord's death and passion were not undergone by the law of human nature, but of His own free will, it says \"as if of linen.\" For when dead according to theflesh He was not dead according to the spirit, because \"His soul was not left in hell, neither did His flesh see corruption.\"[fn-21-P2131_918331:8-nf] And again He says: \"No man taketh My life from Mebut I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.\"[fn-21-P2132_918496:9-nf] And so in this vessel of the Gospels let down from heaven, that is written by the Holy Ghost, all the nations which were formerly outside the observance of the law and reckoned as unclean now flow together through belief in the faith that they may to their salvation be turned away from the worship of idols and be serviceable for health-giving food, and are brought to Peter and cleansed by the voice of the Lord. But at the ninth hour, penetrating to hades, He there by the brightness of His splendour extinguished the indescribable darkness of hell, and, bursting its brazen gates and breaking the iron bars brought away with Him to the skies the captive band of saints which was there shut up and detained in the darkness of inexorable hell,[fn-21-P2133_919261:10-nf] and, by taking away the fiery sword, restored to paradise its original inhabitants by his pious confession. At the same hour, too, Cornelius, the centurion, continuing with his customary devotion in his prayers, is made aware through the converse of the angel with him that his prayers and alms are remembered before the Lord, and at the ninth hour the mystery[fn-21-P2134_920046:11-nf] of the calling of the Gentiles is clearly shown to him, which had been revealed to Peter in his ecstasy of mind at the sixth hour. In another passage, too, in the Acts of the Apostles, we are told as follows about the same time: \"But Peter and John went up into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.\"[fn-21-P2135_920765:12-nf] And by these notices it is clearly proved that these hours were not without good reason consecrated with religious services by holy and apostolic men, and ought to be observed in like manner by us, who, unless we are compelled, as it were, by some rule to discharge these pious offices at least at stated times,either through sloth or through forgetfulness,or being absorbed in business, spend the wholeday without engaging in prayer. But concerning the evening sacrifices what is to be said,since even in the Old Testament these areordered to be offered continually by the law of Moses? For that the morning whole-burnt offerings and evening sacrifices were offered every day continually in the temple, although with figurative offerings, we can show from that which is sung by David: \"Let my prayer be set forth in Thy sight as the incense, and let the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice,\"[fn-21-P2136_921687:13-nf] in which place we can understand it in a still higher sense of that true evening sacrifice which was given by the Lord our Saviour in the evening to the Apostles at the Supper, when He instituted the holy mysteries of the Church, and of that evening sacrifice which He Himself, on the following day, in the end of the ages, offered up to the Father by the lifting up of His hands for the salvation of the whole world; which spreading forth of His hands on the Cross is quite correctly called a \"lifting up.\" For when we were all lying in hades He raised us to heaven, according to the word of His own promise when He says: \"When I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto Me.\"[fn-21-P2137_922402:14-nf] But concerning Martins, that also teaches us which it is customary every day to sing at it: \"O God, my God, to Thee do I watch at break of day;\" and \"I will meditate on Thee in the morning;\" and \"I prevented the dawning of the day and cried;\" and again, \"Mine eyes to Thee have prevented the morning, that I might meditate on Thy words.\"[fn-21-P2138_922762:15-nf] At these hours too that householder in the Gospel hired labourers into his vineyard. For thus also is he described as having hired them in the early morning, which time denotes the Mattin office; then at the third hour; then at the sixth; after this, at the ninth; and last of all, at the eleventh,[fn-21-P2139_923473:16-nf] by which the hour of the lamps[fn-21-P2140_923526:17-nf] is denoted.[fn-21-P2141_923704:18-nf] ","index":"22","references":[{"fn":"21","code":"P2127_915020","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Cf.

Moreover at the sixth hour, Peter, going up to the housetop, was instructed as well by the sign as by the word of God, admonishing him to receive all to the grace of salvation, whereas he was previously doubtful of the receiving of the Gentiles to baptism. And from the sixth hour to the ninth the Lord, being crucified, washed away our sins by His blood; and that He might redeem and quicken us, He then accomplished His victory by His passion. But for us, beloved brethren besides the hours of prayer observed of old, both the times and the sacraments have now increased in number. For we must also pray in the morning, that the Lord's resurrection may be celebrated by morning prayer.... Also at the sun-setting and decline of day we must pray again. For since Christ is the true Sun and the true Day, as the world a sun and day depart, when we pray and ask that light may return to us again, we pray for the advent of Christ, which shall give us the grace of everlasting light.\" Cf. also S. Basil, The Greater Monastic rules, Q. xxxvii., where the same subject is discussed, and Apost. Const. BookVIII.c. xxxiv.

But when some rather carelessly abused this indulgence and prolonged their time for sleep too long, as they were not obliged by the requirements of any service to leave their cells or rise from their beds till the third hour; and when, as well as losing their labour, they were drowsy from excess of sleep in the daytime, when they ought to have been applying themselves to some duties, (especially on those days when an unusually oppressive weariness was caused by their keeping watch from the evening till the approach of morning), a complaint was brought to the Elders by some of the brethren who were ardent in spirit and in no slight measure disturbed by this carelessness, and it was determined by them after long discussion and anxious consideration that up till sunrise, when they could without harm be ready to read or to undertake manual labour, time for rest should be given to their wearied bodies, and after this they should all be summoned to the observance of this service and should rise from their beds, and by reciting three Psalms andprayers (after the order anciently fixed for the observance of Tierce and Sext, to signify the confession of the Trinity)[fn-21-P2147_927758:20-nf] should at the same time by an uniform arrangement put an end to their sleep and make a beginning to their work. And this form, although it may seem to have arisen out of an accident and to have been appointed within recent memory for the reason given above, yet it clearly makes up according to the letter that number which the blessed David indicates (although it can be taken spiritually): \"Seven times a day do I praise Thee because of Thy righteous judgments.\"[fn-21-P2148_928521:21-nf] For by the addition of this service we certainly hold these spiritual assembliesseven times a day, and are shown to sing praises to God seven times in it.[fn-21-P2149_928706:22-nf] Lastly, though this same form, starting from the East, has most beneficially spread to these parts, yet still in some long-established monasteries In the East, which will not brook the slightest violation of the old rules of the Fathers, it seems never to have been introduced.[fn-21-P2150_929677:23-nf] ","index":"25","references":[{"fn":"21","code":"P2146_926165","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"The allusion is to the monastery at Bethlehem, where Cassian had himself been educated.

Moreover, if such were allowed to remain outside the church, they might either sit down at their ease, or while away their time in chatting, or perhaps return to the dormitory and compose themselves to sleep and thus expose themselves to the temptations of the enemy.\" Rule of S. Benedict c. xliii.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter VIII.","index":9,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Of the Vigil service which is celebrated on the evening preceding the Sabbath; of its length, and the manner in which it is observed.","index":"36","references":[]},{"text":"In the winter time, however, when the nights are longer, the Vigils,[fn-21-P2173_937041:30-nf] which are celebrated every week on the evening at the commencing the Sabbath, are arranged by the elders in the monasteries to last till the fourth cock-crow- ing, for this reason, viz., that after the watch through the whole night they may, by resting their bodies for the remaining time of nearly two hours, avoid flagging through drowsiness the whole day long, and be content with repose for this short time instead of resting the whole night. And it is proper for us, too, to observe this with the utmost care, that we may be content with the sleep which is allowed us after the office of Vigils up to daybreak,-i.e., till the Mattin Psalms,[fn-21-P2174_937746:31-nf] -and afterwards spend the whole day in work and necessary duties, lest through weariness from the Vigils, and feebleness, we might be forced to take by day the sleep which we cut off from the night, and so be thought not to have cut short our bodily rest so much as to have changed our time for repose and nightly retirement. For our feeble flesh could not possibly be defrauded of the whole night's rest and yet keep its vigour unshaken throughout the following day without sleepiness of mind and heaviness of spirit, as it will be hindered rather than helped by this unless after Vigils are over it enjoys a short slumber. And, therefore, if, as we have suggested, at least an hour's sleep is snatched before daybreak, we shall save all the hours of Vigils which we have spent all through the night in prayer, granting to nature what is due to it, and having no necessity of taking back by day what we have cut off from the night. For a man will certainly have to give up everything to this flesh if he tries, not in a rational manner to withhold a part only, but to refuse the whole, and (to speak candidly) is anxious to cut off not what is superfluous but what is necessary. Wherefore Vigils have to be made up for with greater interest if they are prolonged with ill-considered and unreasonable length till daybreak. And so they divide them into an office in three parts, that by this variety the effort may be distributed and the exhaustion of the body relieved by some agreeable relaxation. For when standing they have sung three Psalms antiphonally,[fn-21-P2175_939337:32-nf] after this, sitting on the ground or in very low stalls, one of them repeats three Psalms, while the rest respond, each Psalm being assigned to one of the brethren, who succeed each other in turn; and to these they add three lessons while still sitting quietly. And so, by lessening their bodily exertion, they manage to observe their Vigils with greater attention of mind.[fn-21-P2176_939864:33-nf] ","index":"37","references":[{"fn":"21","code":"P2173_937041","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Vigilioe is here used as the equivalent of Nocturns.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"21","code":"P2174_937746","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"I.e., the office of Lauds.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"21","code":"P2175_939337","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Tria Antiphona.

Both methods are described in a well-known passage in an Epistle of S. Basil (Ep. ccvii. ad clericos Neocoes), where he tells us that in the morning service, at one time the people divide themselves into two parties and sing antiphonally to each other (a0ntiya/llousin a/llh/loij), while at another time they entrust to one person the duty of beginning the strain, and the rest respond (u0phxou=si). This latter method seems to have been a very favourite one, the Psalms which were thus sung being called Responsoria. See Isidore, De offic., i. 8; and compare the Dictionary of Christian Antiquities, Vol. II. p. 1745; and Bingham, Antiquities, Book XIV. c. 1.

Wherefore, since that time, a service of Vigils has been appointed for this night, and is still observed in the same way up to the present day all through the East. And so, after the exertion of the Vigil, a dispensation from fasting, appointed in like manner for the Sabbath by apostolic men,[fn-21-P2182_942331:35-nf] is not without reason enjoined in all the churches of the East, in accordance with that saying of Ecclesiastes, which, although it has another and a mystical sense, is not misapplied to this, by which we are charged to give to both days-that is, to the seventh and eighth equally-the same share of the service, as it says: \"Givea portion to these seven and also to these eight.\"[fn-21-P2183_942969:36-nf] For this dispensation from fasting must not be understood as a participation in the Jewish festival by those above all who are shown to be free from all Jewish superstition, but as contributing to that rest of the wearied body of which we have spoken; which, as it fasts continually for five days in the week all through the year, would easily be worn out and fail, unless it were revived by an interval of at least two days.
