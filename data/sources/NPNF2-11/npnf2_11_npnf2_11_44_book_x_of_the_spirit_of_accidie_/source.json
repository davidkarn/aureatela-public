It also makes the man lazy and sluggish about all manner of work which has to be done within the enclosure of his dormitory. It does not suffer him to stay in his cell, or to take any pains about reading, and he often groans because he can do no good while he stays there, and complains and sighs because he can bear no spiritual fruit so long as he is joined to that society; and he complains that he is cut off from spiritual gain, and is of no use in the place, as if he were one who, though he could govern others and be useful to a great number of people, yet was edifying none, nor profiling any one by his teaching and doctrine. He cries up l distant monasteries and those which are a long way off, and describes such places as more profitable and better suited for salvation; and besides this he paints the intercourse with the brethren there as sweet and full of spiritual life. On the other hand, he says that everything about him is rough, and not only that there is nothing edifying among the brethren who are stopping there, but also that even food for the body cannot be procured without great difficulty. Lastly he fancies that he will never be well while he stays in that place, unless he leaves his cell (in which he is lure to die if he stops in it any longer) and takes himself off from thence as quickly as possible. Then the fifth or sixth hour brings him such bodily weariness and longing for food that he seems to himself worn out and wearied as if with a long journey, or some very heavy work, or as if he had put off taking food during a fast of two or three days. Then besides this he looks about anxiously this way and that, and sighs that none of the brethren come to see him, and often goes in and out of his cell, and frequently gazes up at the sun, as if it was too slow in setting, and so a kind of unreasonable confusion of mind takes possession of him like some foul darkness,[fn-30-P3040_1181339:3-nf] and makes him idle and useless for every spiritual work, so that he imagines that no cure for so terrible an attack can be found in anything except visiting some one of the brethren, or in the solace of sleep alone. Then the disease suggests that he ought to show courteous and friendly hospitalities to the brethren, and pay visits to the sick, whether near at hand or far off. He talks too about some dutiful and religious offices; that those kinsfolk ought to be inquired after, and that he ought to go and see them oftener; that it would be a real work of piety to go more frequently to visit that religious woman, devoted to the service of God, who is deprived of all support of kindred; and that it would be a most excellent thing to get what is needful for her who is neglected and despised by her own kinsfolk; and that he ought piously to devote his time to these things instead of staying uselessly and with no profit in his cell.","index":"32","references":[{"fn":"30","code":"P3040_1181339","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Velut toetra suppletur caligine (Petschenig); the text of Gazaeus reads terra for toetra.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter III.","index":4,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Of the different ways in which accidie overcomes a monk.","index":"34","references":[]},{"text":"And so the wretched soul, embarrassed by such contrivances of the enemy, is disturbed, until, worn out by the spirit of accidie, as by some strong battering ram, it either learns to sink into slumber, or, driven out from the confinement of its cell, accustoms itself to seek for consolation under these attacks in visiting some brother, only to be afterwards weakened the more by this remedy which it seeks for the present.

For the mind of an idler cannot think of anything but food and the belly, until the society of some man or woman, equally cold and indifferent, is secured, and it loses itself in their affairs and business, and is thus little by little ensnared by dangerous occupations, so that, just as if it were bound up in the coils of a serpent, it can never disentangle itself again and return to the perfection of its former profession.","index":"44","references":[]}]},{"name":"Chapter VII.","index":8,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Testimonies from the Apostle concerning the spirit of acciie.","index":"46","references":[]},{"text":"The blessed Apostle, like a true and spiritual physician, either seeing this disease, which springs from the spirit of accidie, already creeping in, or foreseeing, through the revelation of the Holy Spirit, that it would arise among monks, is quick to anticipate it by the healing medicines of his directions. For in writing to the Thessalonians, and at first, like a skilful and excellent physician, applying to the infirmity of his patients the soothing and gentle remedy of his words, and beginning with charity, and praising them in that point, that[fn-30-P3063_1186200:6-nf] this deadly wound, having been treated with a milder remedy, might lose its angry fostering and more easily bear severer treatment, he says: \"But concerning brotherly charity ye have no need that I write to you: for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another. For this ye do toward all the brethren in the whole of Macedonia.\"[fn-30-P3064_1186608:7-nf] He first began with the soothing application of praise, and made their ears submissive and ready for the remedy of the healing words. Then he proceeds: \"But we ask you, brethren, to abound more.\" Thus far he soothes them with kind and gentle words; for fear lest he should find them not yet prepared to receive their perfect cure. Why is it that you ask, O Apostle, that they may abound more in charity, of which you had said above, \"But concerning brotherly charity we have no need to write to you\"? And why is it necessary that you should say to them: \"But we ask you to abound more,\" when they did not need o be written to at all on this matter? especially as you add the reason why they do not need it, saying, \"For you yourselves have been aught of God to love one another.\" And you add a third thing still more important: hat not only have they been taught of God, but also that they fulfil in deed that which they are taught. \"For ye do this,\" he says, not to one or two, but \"to all the brethren;\" and not to your own citizens and friends only, but \"in the whole of Macedonia.\" Tell us then, I pray, why it is that you so particularly begin with this. Again he proceeds, \"But we ask you, brethren, to abound the more.\" And with difficulty at last he breaks out into that at which he was driving before: \"and that ye take pains to be quiet.\" He gave the first aim. Then he adds a second, \"and to do your own business;\" and a third as well: \"and work with your own hands, as we commanded you;\" a fourth: \"and to walk honestly towards those that are without;\"a fifth: \"and to covet no man's goods.\" Lo, we can see through that hesitation, which made him with these preludes put off uttering what his mind was full of: \"And that ye take pains to be quiet;\" i.e., that you stop in your cells, and be not disturbed by rumours, which generally spring from the wishes and gossip of idle persons, and so yourselves disturb others. And, \"to do your own business,\" you should not want to require curiously of the world's actions, or, examining the lives of others, want to spend your strength, not on bettering yourselves and aiming at virtue, but on depreciating your brethren. \"And work with your own hands, as we charged you;\" to secure that which he had warned them above not to do; i.e., that they should not be restless and anxious about other people's affairs, nor walk dishonestly towards those without, nor covet another man's goods, he now adds and says, \"and work with your own hands, as we charged you.\" For he has clearly shown that leisure the reason why those things were done which he blamed above. For no one can be restless or anxious about other people's affairs, but one who is not satisfied to apply himself to the work of his own hands. He adds also a fourth evil, which springs also from this leisure, i.e., that they should not walk dishonestly: when he says: \"And that ye walk honestly towards those without.\" He cannot possibly walk honestly, even among those who are men of this world, who is not content to cling to the seclusion of his cell and the work of his own hands; but he is sure to be dishonest, while he seeks his needful food; and to take pains to flatter, to follow up news and gossip, to seek for opportunities for chattering and stories by means of which he may gain a footing and obtain an entrance into the houses of others. \"And that you should not covet another man's goods.\" He is sure to look with envious eyes on another's gifts and boons, who does not care to secure sufficient for his daily food by the dutiful and peaceful labour of his hands. You see what conditions, and how serious and shameful ones, spring solely from the malady of leisure. Lastly, those very people, whom in his first Epistle he had treated with the gentle application of his words, in his second Epistle he en-deavours to heal with severer and sterner remedies, as those who had not profited by more gentle treatment; and he no longer applies the treatment of gentle words, no mild and kindly expressions, as these, \"But we ask you, brethren,\" but \"We adjure you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw from every brother that walketh disorderly.\"[fn-30-P3065_1190829:8-nf] There he asks; here he adjures. There is the kindness of one who is persuading; here the sternness of one protesting and threatening. \"We adjure you, brethren:\" because, when we first asked you, you scorned to listen; now at least obey our threats. And this adjuration he renders terrible, not by his bare word, but by the imprecation of the name of our Lord Jesus Christ: for fear lest they might again scorn it, as merely man's word, and think that it was not of much importance. And forthwith, like a well-skilled physician with festering limbs, to which he could not apply the remedy of a mild treatment, he tries to cure by an incision with a spiritual knife, saying, \"that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not according to the tradition which ye received of us.\" And so he bids them withdraw from those who will not make time for work, and to cut them off like limbs tainted with the festering sores of leisure: test the the malady of idleness, like some deadly con tagion, might infect even the healthy portionof their limbs, by the gradual advance of infection. And when he is going to speak ofthose who will not work with their own hands and eat their bread in quietness, from whom he urges them to withdraw, hear with what reproaches he brands them at starting. First he calls them \"disorderly,\" and \"not walking according to the tradition.\" In other words, he stigmatizes them as obstinate, since they will not walk according to his appointment; and \"dishonest,\" i.e., not keeping to the right and proper times for going out, and visiting, and talking. For a disorderly person is sure to be subject to all those faults. \"And not according to the tradition which they received from us.\" And in this he stamps them as in some sort rebellious, and despisers, who scorned to keep the tradition which they had received from him, and would not follow that which they not only remembered that the master had taught in word, but which they knew that he had performed in deed. \"For you yourselves know how ye ought to be folowers of us.\" He heaps up an immense pile of censure when he asserts that they did not observe that which was still in their memory, and which not only had they learned by verbal instruction, but also had received by the incitement of his example in working.","index":"47","references":[{"fn":"30","code":"P3063_1186200","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Quousque is used as equivalent to donec, again in Conf.

And this, he says, we did not of our own wish, and for our own pleasure, as rest and bodily exercise suggested, but as our necessities and the want of food compelled us to do, and that not without great bodily weariness.
