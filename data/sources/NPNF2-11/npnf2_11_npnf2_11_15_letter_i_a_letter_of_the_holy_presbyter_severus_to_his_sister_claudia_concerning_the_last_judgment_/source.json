For I both wept for joy because I could perceive from the very language of your letters, that you were living according to the precepts of the Lord God, and out of my exceeding desire after you, I could not help lamenting that, without any fault on my part, I was parted from you l and I would have felt this still more strongly had you not sent me a letter. Should I not, then, enjoy the company of such a sister? But I call your salvation to witness, that I have very often wished to come to you, but have up till now been prevented, through the opposition of him[fn-6-P686_278884:1-nf] who is accustomed to hinder us. For, in my eager desire, I was both urgent to satisfy my wishes by seeing you; and we seemed, if we should meet, likely to accomplish more effectually the work of the Lord, since by comforting one another we should live with the heavy load of this world trodden under our feet. But I do not now fix the day or time of visiting you, because, as often as I have done so, I have not been able to fulfil my purpose. I shall wait on the will of the Lord, and hope that, by my supplications and your prayers, he may bring it about that we reap some advantage from our perseverance.[fn-6-P687_279598:2-nf] ","index":"10","references":[{"fn":"6","code":"P686_278884","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Halm reads proesentia, instead of the old reading perseverantia`, but apparently without good grounds.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"6","code":"P687_279598","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Luke ix. 62.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":9,"verses":[62]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter II.","index":3,"paragraphs":[{"text":"But because you have desired from me in all my letters which I had sent to you precepts to nourish your life and faith, it has come to pass that, through the frequency of my writings to you, I have now exhausted language of that kind; and I can really write nothing new to you, so as to avoid what I have written before. And in truth, through the goodness of God, you do not now need to be exhorted, inasmuch as, perfecting your faith at the very beginning of your saintly life, you display a devoted love in Christ. One thing, however, I do press upon you, that you do not go back on things you have already passed away from, that you do not long again for things you have already scorned, and that, having put your hand to the plow, you do not look back[fn-6-P691_280381:3-nf] again, retracing your steps; for, undoubtedly, by falling into this fault, your furrow will lose its straightness, and the cultivator will not receive his own proper reward. Moreover, he does not secure even a measure of thereward, if he has, in a measure, failed. For, as we must flee from sin to righteousness, so he who has entered on the practice of righteousness must beware lest he lay himself open to sin. For it is written that \"his righteousness shall not profit the righteous on the day on which hehas gone astray.\"[fn-6-P692_280928:4-nf] For this, then, we must take our stand, for this we must labor, that we, who have escaped from sins, do not lose the prepared rewards. For the enemy stands ready against us, that he may at once strike the man who has been stripped of the shield of faith. Our shield, therefore, is not to be cast aside, lest our side be exposed to attack; and our sword is not to be put away, lest the enemy then begin to give up all fear: moreover, we know that if he sees a man fully armed, he will retreat. Nor are we ignorant that it is a hard and difficult thing daily to fight against the flesh and the world. But if you reflect upon eternity, and if you consider the kingdom of heaven, which undoubtedly the Lord will condescend to bestow upon us although we are sinners, what suffering, I ask, is sufficiently great, by which we may merit such things? And besides, our struggle in this world is but for a short time; for although death do not speedily overtake us, old age will come. The years flow on, and time glides by; while, as I hope, the Lord Jesus will speedily call us to himself, as being dear to his heart.","index":"12","references":[{"fn":"6","code":"P691_280381","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Ezek. xviii. 24.","bible_refs":[{"book":"ezekiel","chapter":18,"verses":[24]}]},{"fn":"6","code":"P692_280928","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Clericus here remarks that \"these words clearly teach us that Severus knew of no other purgation than that by which we are cleansed in this life from sin by a change of character and which change if we steadily maintain, then, when life is ended, we are received into the abode of Christ, without any dread of the fire of purgatory.\"","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter III.","index":4,"paragraphs":[{"text":"O How happy shall be that departure of ours, when Christ shall receive us into his own abode after we have been purged[fn-6-P696_282504:5-nf] from the stains of sin through the experience[fn-6-P697_282570:6-nf] of a better life!
