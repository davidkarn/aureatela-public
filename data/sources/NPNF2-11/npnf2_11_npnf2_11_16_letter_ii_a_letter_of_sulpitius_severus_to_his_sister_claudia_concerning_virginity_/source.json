For while the whole multitude of those that believe receive equal gifts of grace, and all rejoice in the same blessings of the sacraments, those who are virgins possess something above the rest, since, out of the holy and unstained company of the Church, they are chosen by the Holy Spirit, and are presented by the bishop[fn-7-P735_293386:1-nf] at the altar of God, as if being more holy and pure sacrifices, on account of the merits of their voluntary dedication. This is truly a sacrifice worthy of God, inasmuch as it is the offering of so precious a being, and none will please him more than the sacrifice of his own image. For I think that the Apostle especially referred to a sacrifice of this kind, when he said, \"Now, I beseech you, brethren, by the mercy of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable[fn-7-P736_293898:2-nf] to God.\" Virginity, therefore, possesses both that which others have, and that which others have not; while it obtains both common and special grace, and rejoices (so to speak) in its own peculiar privilege of consecration. For ecclesiastical authority permits us to style virgins also the brides of Christ; while, after the manner of brides, it veils those whom it consecrates to the Lord, openly exhibiting those as very especially about to possess spiritual marriage who have fled away from carnal fellowship. And those are worthily united, after a spiritual manner, to God, in accordance with the analogy of marriage, who, from love to him, have set at nought human alliances. In their case, that saying of the apostle finds its fullest possible fulfillment, \"He who is joined to the Lord,[fn-7-P737_294710:3-nf] is one spirit.\"","index":"22","references":[{"fn":"7","code":"P735_293386","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Rom. xii. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":12,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"7","code":"P736_293898","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"1 Cor. vi. 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":6,"verses":[17]}]},{"fn":"7","code":"P737_294710","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"\"sopire luxuriam,\" lit. to put to sleep.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter II.","index":3,"paragraphs":[{"text":"For it is a great and a divine thing, almost beyond a corporeal nature, to lay aside[fn-7-P741_294865:4-nf] luxury, and to extinguish, by strength of mind, the flame of concupiscence, kindled by the torch of youth; to put down by spiritual effort the force of natural delight; to live in opposition to the practice of the human race; to despise the comforts of wedlock; to disdain the sweet enjoyments derived from children; and to regard as nothing, in the hope of future blessedness, everything that is reckoned among the advantages of this present life. This is, as I have said, a great and admirable virtue, and is not undeservedly destined to a vast reward, in proportion to the greatness of its labor. The Scripture says, \"I will give to the eunuchs, saith the Lord, a place in my house and within my walls, a place counted better than[fn-7-P742_295667:5-nf] sons and daughters; I will give them an eternal name, and it shall not[fn-7-P743_295754:6-nf] fail.\" The Lord again speaks concerning such enunchs in the Gospel, saying, \"For there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake.\"[fn-7-P744_295939:7-nf] Great, indeed, is the struggle connected with chastity, but greater is the reward; the restraint is temporal, but the reward will be eternal.

He thus furnished in his own person to men, and in the person of his mother to women, an example of virginity, by which it might be proved, with respect to both sexes, hat the blessed state of purity possessed the fullness of divinity,[fn-7-P749_297287:9-nf] for whatever dwelt in the Son was also wholly in the mother. But why should I take pains to make known the excellent and surpassing merit of chastity, and to set forth the glorious good of virginity, when I am not ignorant that many have discoursed on this subject, and have proved its blessedness by most conclusive reasons, and since it can never be a matter of doubt to any reflecting mind, that a thing has all the more merit, the more difficult it is of accomplishment?For if any one judges chastity to be of no moment or only of small consequence, it is certain that he is either ignorant of the matter, or is not willing to incur the trouble it implies. Hence it comes to pass that those always derogate from the importance of chastity, who either do not possess it, or who are unwillingly compelled to maintain it.","index":"26","references":[{"fn":"7","code":"P749_297287","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"\"quod sine aeternae vitae merito neminem consequi posse satis certum est.\"","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter IV.","index":5,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Now, therefore, since we have set forth, although in few words, both the difficulty and the merit of purity, great care must be taken lest a matter which in itself implies great virtue, and is also destined to a vast reward, should fail to produce its proper fruits. For the more precious every sort of thing is, the more it is guarded with anxious solicitude. And since there are many things which fail to secure their proper excellence, unless they are assisted by the aid of other things, as is, for instance, the case with honey, which, unless it is preserved by the protection of wax, and by the cells of the honeycombs, and is indeed, to state the matter more truly, sustained by these, loses its deliciousness and cannot exist apart by itself; and again as it is with wine, which: unless it be kept in vessels of a pleasant odor, and with the pitch frequently renewed, loses the power of its natural sweetness; so great care must be taken lest perchance some things may be necessary also to virginity, without which it can by no means produce its proper fruits, and thus a matter of so great difficulty may be of no advantage (while all the time it is believed to be of advantage), because it is possessed without the other necessary adjuncts. For unless I am mistaken, chastity is preserved in its entirety, for the sake of the reward to be obtained in the kingdom of heaven, which it is perfectly certain no one can obtain who does[fn-7-P753_299640:10-nf] not deserve eternal life. But that eternal life cannot be merited except by the keeping of all the divine commandments, the Scripture testifies, saying, \"If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.\"[fn-7-P754_299868:11-nf] Therefore no one has that life, except the man who has kept all the precepts of the law, and he who has not such life cannot be a possessor of the kingdom of heaven, in which it is not the dead, but the living who shall reign. Therefore virginity, which hopes for the glory of the kingdom of heaven, will profit nothing by itself, unless it also possess that to which eternal life is promised, by means of which the reward of the kingdom of heaven is possessed. Above all things, therefore, the commandments which have been enjoined upon us must be kept by those who preserve chastity in its entireness, and who are hoping for its reward from the justice of God, lest otherwise the pains taken to maintain a glorious chastity and continence come to nothing. No one acquainted with the law does not know that virginity is above[fn-7-P755_300809:12-nf] the commandment or precept, as the Apostle says, \"Now, as to virgins, I have no precept of the Lord, but I give my advice.\"[fn-7-P756_300955:13-nf] When, therefore, he simply gives advice about maintaining virginity, and lays down no precept, he acknowledges that it is above the commandment. Those, therefore, who preserve virginity, do more than the commandment requires. But it will then only profit you to have done more than was commanded, if you also do that which is commanded. For how can you boast that you have done more, if, in respect to some point, you do less?Desiring to fulfill the Divine counsel, see that, above all things, you keep the commandment: wishing to attain to the reward of virginity, see that you keep fast hold of what is necessary to merit life, that your chastity may be such as can receive a recompense. For as the observance of the commandments ensures life, so, on the other hand, does the violation give rise to death. And he who through disobedience has been doomed to death cannot hope for the crown pertaining to virginity; nor, when really handed over to punishment, can he expect the reward promised to chastity.","index":"28","references":[{"fn":"7","code":"P753_299640","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Matt. xix. 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":19,"verses":[17]}]},{"fn":"7","code":"P754_299868","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"\"supra mandatum\": Clericus remarks on this, \"Non supra, sed proeter, nam ea de re nihil praecepit Christus.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"7","code":"P755_300809","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"1 Cor. vii. 25.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":7,"verses":[25]}]},{"fn":"7","code":"P756_300955","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Ps. xxxiv. 14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":34,"verses":[14]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter V.","index":6,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Now, there are three kinds of virtue, by means of which the possession of the kingdom of heaven is secured. The first is chastity, the second, contempt of the world, and the third, righteousness, which, as when joined together, they very greatly benefit their possessors, so, when separated, they can hardly be of any advantage, since every one of them is required, not for its own sake only, but for the sake of another. First of all, then, chastity is demanded, that contempt of the world may more easily follow, because the world can be more easily despised by those who are not held fast in the bonds of matrimony. Contempt of the world, again, is required, in order that righteousness may be maintained, which those can with difficulty fully preserve who are involved in desires after worldly advantages, and in the pursuit of mundane pleasures. Whosoever, therefore, possesses the first kind of virtue, chastity, but does not, at the same time, have the second, which is contempt of the world, possesses the first almost to no purpose, since he does not have the second, for the sake of which the first was required. And if any one possesses the first and second, but is destitute of the third which is righteousness, he labors in vain, since the former two are principally required for the sake of the third. For what profits it to possess chastity in order to contempt of the world, and yet not to have that on account of which you have the other? Or why should you despise the things of the world, if you do not observe righteousness, for the sake of which it is fitting that you should possess chastity, as well as contempt for the world? For as the first kind of virtue is on account of the second, and the second on account of the third, so the first and the second are on account of the third; and if it does not exist, neither the first nor the second will prove of any advantage.","index":"30","references":[]}]},{"name":"Chapter VI.","index":7,"paragraphs":[{"text":"But you perhaps say here, \"Teach me, then, what righteousness is, so that knowing it, I may be able more easily to fully practice it.\" Well, I shall briefly explain it to you, as I am able, and shah use the simplicity of common words, seeing that the subject of which we treat is such as ought by no means to be obscured by attempts at eloquent description, but should be opened up by the simplest forms of expression. For a matter which is necessary to all in common ought to be set forth in a common sort of speech. Righteousness, then, is nothing else than not to commit sin; and not to commit sin is just to keep the precepts of the law. Now, the observance of these precepts is maintained in a two-fold way-thus, that one do none of those things which are forbidden, and that he strive to fulfill the things which are commanded. This is he meaning of the following statement: \"Depart from evil, and do[fn-7-P763_304803:14-nf] good.\" For I do not wish you to think that righteousness consists imply in not doing evil, since not to do good is also evil, and a transgression of the law takes n place in both, since he who said, \"Depart fromevil\" said also, \"and do good.\" If you depart from evil, and do not do good, you are a transgressor of the law, which is fulfilled, not simply by abhorring all evil deeds, but also by the performance of good works. For, indeed, you have not merely received this commandment, that you should not deprive one who is clothed of his garments, but that you should cover with your own the man who has been deprived of his; nor that you should not take away bread of his own from one who has it, but that youshould willingly impart of your bread to himwho has none; nor that you should not simply not drive away a poor man from a shelter of his own, but that you should receive him when he has been driven out, and has no shelter, into your own. For the precept which has beer, given us is \"to weep with them that[fn-7-P764_305840:15-nf] weep.\" But how can we weep with them, if we share in none of their necessities, and afford no help to them in those matters on account of which they lament? For God does not call for the fruitless moisture of our tears; but, because tears are an indication of grief, he wishes you to feel the distresses of another as if they were your own. And just as you would wish aid to be given you if you were in such tribulation, so should you help another in accordance with the statement, \"Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so[fn-7-P765_306407:16-nf] to them.\" For to weep with one that weeps, and at the same time to refuse to help, when you can, him that weeps, is a proof of mockery, and not of piety. In short, our Saviour wept with Mary and Martha, the sisters of Lazarus, and proved the feeling of infinite compassion within him by the witness of his tears. But works, as the proofs of true affection soon followed, when Lazarus, for whose sake the tears were shed, was raised up and restored to his sisters. This was sincerely to weep with those who wept, when the occasion of the weeping was removed. But he did it, you will say, as having the power. Well, nothing is demanded of you which it is impossible for you to perform: he has fulfilled his entire duty who has done what he could.","index":"32","references":[{"fn":"7","code":"P763_304803","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Rom. xii. 15.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":12,"verses":[15]}]},{"fn":"7","code":"P764_305840","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Matt. vii. 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":7,"verses":[12]}]},{"fn":"7","code":"P765_306407","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Matt. xxv. 41.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":25,"verses":[41]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter VII.","index":8,"paragraphs":[{"text":"But (as we had begun to remark) it is not sufficient for a Christian to keep himself from wickedness, unless he also has fulfilled the duties implied in good works, as is very distinctly proved by that statement in which the Lord threatened that those will be doomed to eternal fire, who, although they have done no evil, have not done all that is good, declaring \"Then will the king say to those who are on his fight hand: depart from me, ye cursed, into eternal fire, which my Father has prepared for the devil and his angels; for I was hungry, and ye gave me not to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no[fn-7-P769_307790:17-nf] drink,\" with what follows. He did not say, \"Depart from me, ye cursed, because ye have committed murder, or adultery, or theft\"; for it is not because they had done evil, but because they had not done good, that they are condemned, and doomed to the punishments of the eternal Gehenna; nor because they had committed things which were forbidden, but because they had not been willing to do those things which had been commanded. And from this it is to be observed what hope those can have, who, in addition, do some of those things which are forbidden, when even such are doomed to eternal fire as have simply not done the things which are commanded. For I do not wish you to flatter yourself in this way,-if you have not done certain things, because you have done certain other things, since it is written, \"Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, has become guilty of all.\"[fn-7-P770_308710:18-nf] For Adam sinned once, and died; and do you think that you can live, when you are often doing that which. killed another person, when he had only done it once? Or do you imagine that he committed a great crime, and was therefore justly condemned to a severer punishment? Let us consider, then, what it was he really did. He ate of the fruit of the tree, contrary to the commandment. What then? Did God punish man with death for the sake of the fruit of a tree?No: not on account of the fruit of the tree, but on account of the contempt of the commandment. The question, therefore, is not about the nature of the offense, but about the transgression of the commandment. And the same being who told Adam not to eat of the fruit of the tree, has commanded you not to speak evil, not to lie, not to detract, not to listen to a detractor, to swear not at all, not to covet, not to envy, not to be drunken, not to be greedy, not to render evil for evil to any one, to love your enemies, to bless them that curse you, to pray for them that malign and persecute you, to turn the other cheek to one smiting you, and not to go to law before a worldly tribunal, so that, if any one seeks to take away your goods, you should joyfully lose them, to flee from the charge of avarice, to beware of the sin of all pride and boastfulness, and live, humble and meek, after the example of Christ, avoiding fellowship with the wicked so completely that you will not even eat with fornicators, or covetous persons, or those that speak evil of others, or the envious, or detractors, or the drunken, or the rapacious. Now, if you despise him in any such matter, then, if he spared Adam, he will also spare you. Yea, he might have been spared with better reason than you, inasmuch as he was still ignorant and inexperienced, and was restrained by the example of no one who had previously sinned, and who had died on account of his sin.But after such examples as you possess, after the law, after the prophets, after the gospels, and after the apostles, if you still set your mind on transgressing, I see not in what way pardon can be extended to you.","index":"34","references":[{"fn":"7","code":"P769_307790","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"James ii. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"james","chapter":2,"verses":[10]}]},{"fn":"7","code":"P770_308710","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"The genuineness of this clause is very doubtful, and the text is, at best, exceedingly corrupt.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter VIII.","index":9,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Do you flatter yourself on account of the attribute of virginity? Remember Adam and Eve fell when they were virgins, and that the perfect purity of their bodies did not profit them when they sinned. The virgin who sins is to be compared to Eve, and not to Mary. We do not deny that, in the present life, there is the remedy of repentance, but we remind you rather to hope for reward, than to look for pardon. For it is disgraceful that those should ask for indulgence who are expecting the crown of virginity,and that those should commit anything unlawful who have even cut themselves off from things lawful; for it must be remembered that it is lawful to contract an alliance by marriage. And as those are to be praised who, from love to Christ, and for the glory of the kingdom of heaven, have despised the tie of wedlock, so those are to be condemned who, through the pleasure of incontinence, after they have vowed themselves to God, have recourse to the Apostolic remedy. Therefore, as we have said, those who decline marriage despise not things unlawful, but things lawful. And if that class of people swear, if they speak evil of others, if they are detractors, or if they patiently listen to detractors, if they return evil for evil, if they incur the charge of covetousness with respect to other people's property, or of avarice in regard to their own, if they cherish the poison of revenge or envy, if they either say or think anything unbefitting against the institutions of the law orthe Apostles, if with a desire of pleasing in the flesh, they exhibit themselves dressed up and adorned, if they do any other unlawful things, as is only too common, what will it profit them to have spurned what is lawful, while they practice what is not lawful?If you wish it to be of advantage to you, that you have despised things lawful, take care that you do not any of those things which are not lawful. For, it is foolish to have dreaded that which is in its nature less, and not to dread that which is intrinsically more [or not to avoid those things[fn-7-P774_313004:19-nf] which are inter- dicted, while such things as are permitted meet with contempt]. For the Apostle says, \"She that is unmarried careth for the things of the Lord, how she may please God, that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but she who is married careth for the things of this world, how she may please[fn-7-P775_313335:20-nf] her husband.\" He thus affirms that the married woman pleases her husband by thinking of worldly things, while the unmarried woman pleases God, inasmuch as she has no anxiety about the things of the world. Let him tell me, then, whom she desires to please, who has no husband, and yet cares for the things of the world? Shall not the married woman, in such a case, be preferred to her? Yes, since she by caring for the things of the world pleases at least her husband, but the other neither pleases her husband, since she does not have one, nor can she please God.[fn-7-P776_313989:21-nf] But it is not fitting that we should pass over in silence that which he said: \"The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, how she may please God, that she may be holy both in body and spirit\" [she careth, he says, for the things of the Lord; she does not care for the things of the world, or of men, but for the things of God]. What, then, are the things of the Lord? Let the Apostle tell: \"Whatsoever[fn-7-P777_314455:22-nf] things are holy, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise of doctrine\": these are the things of the Lord, which holy and truly apostolic virgins meditate upon, and think of, day and night, without any interval of time. Of the Lord is the resurrection of the dead, of the Lord is immortality, of the Lord is incorruption, of the Lord is that splendor of the sun which is promised to the saints, as it is written in the Gospel, \"Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father\":[fn-7-P778_315090:23-nf] of the Lord are the many mansions of the righteous in the heavens of the Lord is the fruit which is produced, whether thirty fold, or sixty fold, or an hundred fold. Those virgins who think on these things, and by what works they may be able to merit them, think of the things of the Lord. Of the Lord, too, is the law of the new and old testament, in which shine forth the holy utterances of his lips; and if any virgins meditate without intermission on these things, they think of the things of the Lord.

I beg you not to think it is an inverted order that I have said the tongue should be cleansed from swearing before perjury, for one will then the more easily escape perjury, if he swears not at all, so that there may be fulfilled in him that statement, \"Keep[fn-7-P791_319148:30-nf] thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.\" And be mindful of the Apostle who says, \"Bless, and[fn-7-P792_319276:31-nf] curse not.\" But often call to mind the following words, \"See that no one render evil for evil to any man, or cursing for cursing, but on the contrary, do ye bless them, because to this ye have been called, that ye should possess a blessing[fn-7-P793_319552:32-nf] by inheritance\"; and this other passage, \"If any[fn-7-P794_319620:33-nf] one offend not in tongue, he is a perfect man.\" For it is shameful that those lips, by which you confess God, pray to him, bless him, and praise him, should be defiled by the pollution of any sin. I know not with what conscience any one can pray to God with that tongue with which he either speaks falsehood, or calumniates, or detracts. God listens to holy lips, and speedily answers those prayers which an unpolluted tongue pours forth. Cleanse also thine ears, so that they may not listen except to holy and true discourse, that they never admit into them obscene, or infamous, or worldly words, or tolerate any one detracting from another, on account of that which is written, \"Hedge up[fn-7-P795_320334:34-nf] thine ears with thorns, and do not listen to a wicked tongue, that you may have your part with him, of whom it is said, that he was[fn-7-P796_320485:35-nf] righteous in hearing and seeing; i.e. he sinned neither with his eyes nor his ears. Cleanse, too, thy hands, \"that they n be not stretched out to receive, but shut against giving,\" and that they[fn-7-P797_320700:36-nf] be not prompt to strike, but ever ready for all the works of mercy and piety. In fine, cleanse thy feet, that they follow not the broad and ample way which leads to grand and costly worldly banquets, but that they tread rather the difficult and narrow path, which guides to heaven, for it is written, \"Make a[fn-7-P798_321028:37-nf] straight path for your feet.\" Acknowledge that your members were formed for you by God the Maker, not for vices, but for virtues; and, when you have cleansed the whole of your limbs from every stain of sin, and they have become sanctified throughout your whole body, then understand that this purity will profit you, and look forward with all confidence to the prize of virginity.","index":"40","references":[{"fn":"7","code":"P787_318061","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"The text here is most uncertain; Halm's \"ut non aurea reticula capillus portet\" is \"that thy hair may not carry golden nets.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"7","code":"P788_318252","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Prov. iii. 3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","chapter":3,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"7","code":"P789_318405","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Wisd. i. 11.","bible_refs":[{"book":"wisdom","chapter":1,"verses":[11]}]},{"fn":"7","code":"P790_318771","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Ps. xxxiv. 13.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":34,"verses":[13]}]},{"fn":"7","code":"P791_319148","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Rom. xii. 14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":12,"verses":[14]}]},{"fn":"7","code":"P792_319276","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"1 Thess. v. 15; 1 Pet. iii. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 thessalonians","chapter":5,"verses":[15]},{"book":"1 peter","chapter":3,"verses":[9]},{"book":"1 thessalonians","chapter":5,"verses":[15]},{"book":"1 peter","chapter":3,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"7","code":"P793_319552","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"James iii. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"james","chapter":3,"verses":[2]}]},{"fn":"7","code":"P794_319620","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Eccl. xxviii. 24.","bible_refs":[{"book":"ecclesiastes","chapter":28,"verses":[24]}]},{"fn":"7","code":"P795_320334","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"2 Pet. ii. 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 peter","chapter":2,"verses":[8]}]},{"fn":"7","code":"P796_320485","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Eccls. iv. 31.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"7","code":"P797_320700","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Prov. iv. 26.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","chapter":4,"verses":[26]}]},{"fn":"7","code":"P798_321028","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Prov. iv. 23.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","chapter":4,"verses":[23]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter XI.","index":12,"paragraphs":[{"text":"I believe that I have now set forth, briefly indeed, but, at the same time, fully, what is implied in a woman's purity of body: it remains that we should learn what it is to be pure also in spirit; i.e. that what it is unlawful for one to do in act, it is also unlawful for one even to imagine in thought. For she is holy, alike in body and in spirit, who sins neither in mind nor heart, knowing that God is one who examines also the heart; and, therefore, she takes every pains to possess a mind as well as a body free from sin. Such a person is aware that it is written, \"Keep thy[fn-8-P802_322021:38-nf] heart with all diligence\"; and again, \"God loveth[fn-8-P803_322099:39-nf] holy hearts, and all the undefiled are acceptable to him\"; and elsewhere, \"Blessed[fn-8-P804_322199:40-nf] are those of a pure heart; for they shall see God.\" I think that this last statement is made regarding those whom conscience accuses of the guilt of no sin; concerning whom I think that John also spoke in his Epistle when he said, \"If our heart[fn-8-P805_322465:41-nf] condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God, and whatsoever we ask we shall receive from him.\" I do not wish you to think that you have escaped the accusation of sin, although act does not follow desire, since it is written, \"Whosoever[fn-8-P806_322727:42-nf] looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart.\" And do not say, \"I had the thought, indeed, but I did not carry it out in act\"; for it is unlawful even to desire that which it is unlawful to do. Wherefore also blessed Peter issues a precept to this effect: \"purify your[fn-8-P807_323062:43-nf] souls\"; and if he had not been aware of such a thing as defilement of the soul, he would not have expressed a desire that it should be purified. But we should also very carefully consider that passage which says, \"These[fn-8-P808_323301:44-nf] are they who did not defile themselves with women, for they remained virgins, and they follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth\"; and should reflect whether, if these are joined to the Divine retinue, and traverse all the regions of the heavens, through the merit of chastity and purity alone, there may be also other means by which virginity being assisted may attain to the glory of so great blessedness. But whence shall we be able to know this?From the following passages (if I mistake not) in which it is written, \"These were[fn-8-P809_323851:45-nf] purchased from among men as the first fruits to God and the Lamb, and in their mouth there was found no falsehood, for they are without spot before the throne of God.\" You see, then, that they are spoken of as closely following in the footsteps of the Lord, not in virtue of one member only, but those are said to do so, who, besides virginity, had passed a life freed from all the pollution of sin. Wherefore, let the virgin especially despise marriage on this account, that, while she is safer than others, she may the more easily accomplish what is also required from those who are married; viz. keep herself from all sin, and obey all the commandments of the law. For if she does not marry, and nevertheless indulges in those things from which even married women are enjoined to keep themselves free, what will it profit her not to have married?For although it is not allowed to any Christian to commit sin, and it befits all without exception who are purified through the sanctification of the spiritual bath, to lead an unstained life, that they may be thoroughly identified[fn-8-P810_324960:46-nf] with the Church, which is described as being \"without[fn-8-P811_325031:47-nf] spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing,\" much more is it requisite that a virgin should reach this standard, whom neither the existence of a husband, nor of sons, nor of any other necessity, prevents from fully carrying out the demands of holy Scripture; nor shall she be able, if she fail, to defend herself by any sort of excuse.","index":"42","references":[{"fn":"8","code":"P802_322021","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Prov. xvii. 3; xi. 20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","chapter":17,"verses":[3]},{"book":"proverbs","chapter":17,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P803_322099","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Matt. v. 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":5,"verses":[8]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P804_322199","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"1 John iii. 21.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 john","chapter":3,"verses":[21]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P805_322465","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Matt. v. 28.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":5,"verses":[28]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P806_322727","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"1 Pet. i. 22.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 peter","chapter":1,"verses":[22]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P807_323062","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Rev. xiv. 4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"revelation","chapter":14,"verses":[4]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P808_323301","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Rev. xiv. 4 ff.","bible_refs":[{"book":"revelation","chapter":14,"verses":[4]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P809_323851","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"\"visceribus intimari.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"8","code":"P810_324960","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Eph. v. 27.","bible_refs":[{"book":"ephesians","chapter":5,"verses":[27]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P811_325031","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"1 Pet. iii. 1. ff.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 peter","chapter":3,"verses":[1]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter XII.","index":13,"paragraphs":[{"text":"O Virgin, maintain thy purpose which is destined for a great reward.

There is now among such no place for lowness of birth; nor is any one inferior to another whom the majesty of the divine birth adorns; except in the estimation of those who do not think that the things of heaven are to be preferred to those of earth. There can be no worldly boasting among them, if they reflect how vain a thing it is that they should, in smaller matters, prefer themselves to those whom they know to be equal to themselves in greater matters, and should regard, as placed below themselves on earth, those whom they believe to be equal to themselves in what relates to heaven.

For God sets a higher value on the tears of one thus praising[fn-8-P854_341049:66-nf] him, than on the beauty of his voice; as the prophet says, \"Serve[fn-8-P855_341132:67-nf] the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.\" Now, where there are fear and trembling, there is no lifting up of the voice, but humility of mind with lamentation and tears. Display diligence in all thy doings; for it is written, \"Cursed[fn-8-P856_341394:68-nf] is the man who carelessly performs the work of the Lord.\" Let grace grow in you with years; let righteousness increase with age; and let your faith appear the more perfect the older you become; for Jesus, who has left us an example how to live, increased not only in years as respected his body, but in wisdom and spiritual grace before God and men. Reckon all the time in which you do not perceive yourself growing better as positively lost. Maintain to the last that purpose of virginity which you have formed; for it is the part of virtue not merely to begin, but to finish, as the Lord says in the Gospel, \"Whosoever[fn-8-P857_342033:69-nf] shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved.\" Beware, therefore, lest you furnish to any one an occasion even of evil desire, because thy God, betrothed to thee, is jealous; for an adulteress against Christ is more guilty than one against her husband. Be thou, therefore, a model of life to all; be an example; and excel in actual conduct those whom you precede in your consecration[fn-8-P858_342476:70-nf] to chastity. Show thyself in all respects a virgin; and let no stain of corruption be brought as a charge against thy person. And let one whose body is perfect in its purity be also irreproachable in conduct. Now, as we said in the beginning of this letter, that you have become a sacrifice pertaining to God, such a sacrifice as undoubtedly imparts its own sanctity also to others, that, as every one worthily receives from it, he himself also may be a partaker of sanctification, so then, let the other virgins also be sanctified through you, as by means of a divine offering. Show yourself to them so holy in all things, that, whosoever comes in contact with thy life, whether by hearing or seeing, may experience the power of sanctification, and may feel that such an amount of grace passes to him from your manner of acting, that, while he desires to imitate thee, he himself becomes worthy of being a sacrifice devoted to God.","index":"58","references":[{"fn":"8","code":"P853_340816","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"\"psallentis.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"8","code":"P854_341049","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Ps. ii. 11.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":2,"verses":[11]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P855_341132","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Jer. xlviii. 10.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"8","code":"P856_341394","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Matt. x. 22.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":10,"verses":[22]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P857_342033","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"The text and meaning are here somewhat uncertain.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"8","code":"P858_342476","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"\"renuntiasse.\"","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"","index":"59","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"60","references":[]}]}]}
