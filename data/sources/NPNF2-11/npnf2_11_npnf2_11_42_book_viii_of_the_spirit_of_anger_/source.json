For we ought to see that the limbs signify the divine powers and boundless operations of God, which can only be represented to us by the familiar expression of limbs: by the mouth we should understand that His utterances are meant, which are of His mercy continually poured into the secret senses of the soul, or which He spoke among our fathers and the prophets: by the eyes we can understand the boundless character of His sight with which He sees and looks through all things, and so nothing is hidden from Him of what is done or can be done by us, or even thought. By the expression \"hands,\" we understand His providence and work, by which He is the creator and author of all things; the arms are the emblems of His might and government, with which He upholds, rules and controls all things. And not to speak of other things, what else does the hoary hair of His head signify but the eternity and perpetuity of Deity, through which He is without any beginning, and before all times, and excels all creatures? So then also when we read of the anger or fury of the Lord, we should take it not a0nqrwpopaqw=j; i.e., according to an unworthy meaning of human passion,[fn-28-P2861_1144000:16-nf] but in a sense worthy of God, who is free from all passion; so that by this we should understand that He is the judge and avenger of all the unjust things which are done in this world; and by reason of these terms and their meaning we should dread Him as the terrible rewarder of our deeds, and fear to do anything against His will. For human nature is wont to fear those whom it knows to be indignant, and is afraid of offending: as in the case of some most just judges, avenging wrath is usually feared by those who are tormented by some accusation of their conscience; not indeed that this passion exists in the minds of those who are going to judge with perfect equity, but that, while they so fear, the disposition of the judge towards them is that which is the precursor of a just and impartial execution of the law. And this, with whatever kindness and gentleness it may be conducted, is deemed by those who are justly to be punished to be the most savage wrath and vehement anger. It would be tedious and outside the scope of the present work were we to explain all the things which are spoken metaphorically of God in Holy Scripture, with human figures. Let it be enough for our present purpose, which is aimed against the sin of wrath, to have said this that no one may through ignorance draw down upon himself a cause of this evil and of eternal death, out of those Scriptures in which he should seek for saintliness and immortality as the remedies to bring life and salvation.","index":"35","references":[{"fn":"28","code":"P2861_1144000","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Ps. lxxvii.

And therefore our prayer will lose its effect, if our brother has anything against us, just as much as if we were cherishing feelings of bitterness against him in a swelling and wrathful spirit.","index":"65","references":[]}]},{"name":"Chapter XV.","index":16,"paragraphs":[{"text":"How the Old Law would root out anger not only from the actions but from the thoughts.","index":"67","references":[]},{"text":"But why should we spend any more time over evangelic and apostolic precepts, when even the old law, which is thought to be some- what slack, guards against the same thing, when it says, \"Thou shall not hate thy brother in thine heart;\" and again, \"Be not mindful of the injury of thy citizens;\"[fn-29-P2922_1158416:33-nf] and again, \"The ways of those who preserve the recollection of wrongs are towards death\"?[fn-29-P2923_1158527:34-nf] You see there too that wickedness is restrained not only in action, but also in the secret thoughts, since it is commanded that hatred be utterly rooted out from the heart, and not merely retaliation for, but the very recollection of, a wrong done.","index":"68","references":[{"fn":"29","code":"P2922_1158416","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"1 Thess. v. 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 thessalonians","chapter":5,"verses":[17]}]},{"fn":"29","code":"P2923_1158527","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"1 Tim. ii. 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 timothy","chapter":2,"verses":[8]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter XVI.","index":17,"paragraphs":[{"text":"How useless is the retirement of those who do not give up their bad manners.","index":"70","references":[]},{"text":"Sometimes when we have been overcome by pride or impatience, and we want to improve our rough and bearish manners, we complain that we require solitude, as if we should find the virtue of patience there where nobody provokes us: and we apologize for our carelessness, and say that the reason of our disturbance does not spring from our own impatience, but from the fault of our brethren.

For whatever faults we bring with us uncured into the desert, we shall find to remain concealed in us and not to be got rid of. For just as when the character has been improved, solitude can lay open to it the purest contemplation, and reveal the knowledge of spiritual mysteries to its clear gaze, so it generally not only preserves but intensifies the faults of those who have undergone no correction. For a man appears to himself to be patient and humble, just as long as he comes across nobody in intercourse; but he will presently revert to his former nature, whenever the chance of any sort of passion occurs: I mean that those faults will at once appear on the surface which were lying hid, and, like unbridled horses diligently fed up during too long a time of idleness, dash forth from the barriers the more eagerly and fiercely, to the destruction of their charioteer. For when the opportunity for practising them among men is removed, our faults will more and more increase in us, unless we have first been purified from them. And the mere shadow of patience, which, when we mixed with our brethren, we seemed fancifully to possess, at least out of respect for them and publicity, we lose altogether through sloth and carelessness.","index":"77","references":[]}]},{"name":"Chapter XIX.","index":20,"paragraphs":[{"text":"An illustration to help in forming an opinion on those who are only patient when they are not tried by any one.","index":"79","references":[]},{"text":"But it is like all poisonous kinds of serpents or of wild beasts, which, while they remain in solitude and their own lairs, are still not harmless;[fn-29-P2940_1161917:35-nf] for they cannot really be said to be harmless, because they are not actually hurting anybody. For this results in their case, not from any feeling of goodness, but from the exigencies of solitude, and when they have secured an opportunity of hurting some one, at once they produce the poison stored up in them, and show the ferocity of their nature. And so in the case of men who are aiming at perfection, it is not enough not to be angry with men. For we recollect that when we were living in solitude a feeling of irritation would creep over us against our pen because it was too large or too small; against our penknife when it cut badly and with a blunt edge what we wanted cut; and against a flint if by chance when we were rather late and hurrying to the reading, a spark of fire flashed out, so that we could not remove and get rid of our perturbation of mind except by cursing the senseless matter, or at least the devil. Wherefore for a method of perfection it will not be of any use for there to be a dearth of men against whom our anger might be roused: since, if patience has not already been acquired, the feelings of passion which still dwell in our hearts can equally well spend themselves on dumb things and paltry objects, and not allow us to gain a continuous state of peacefulness, or to be free from our remaining faults: unless perhaps we think that some advantage and a sort of cure may be gained for our passion from the fact that inanimate and speechless things cannot possibly reply to our curses and rage, nor provoke our ungovernable temper to break out into a worse madness of passion.","index":"80","references":[{"fn":"29","code":"P2940_1161917","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Lev. xix. 17, 18.","bible_refs":[{"book":"leviticus","chapter":19,"verses":[17]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter XX.","index":21,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Of the way in which auger should be banished according to the gospel.","index":"82","references":[]},{"text":"Wherefore if we wish to gain the substance of that divine reward of which it is said, \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God,\"[fn-29-P2945_1163777:36-nf] we ought not only to banish it from our actions, but entirely to root it out from our inmost soul. For it will not be of any good to have checked anger in words, and not to have shown it in deeds, if God, from whom the secrets of the heart are not hid, sees that it remains in the secret recesses of our bosom. For the word of the gospel bids us destroy the roots of our faults rather than the fruits; for these, when the incitements are all removed, will certainly not put forth shoots any more; and so the mind will be able to continue in all patience and holiness, when this anger has been removed, not from the surface of acts and deeds, but from the very innermost thoughts.

Wherefore it appears to have been added by those who did not understand the drift of Scripture, which intended altogether to banish the incentive to anger, and to reserve no occasion whatever for indignation; lest while we were commanded to be angry with a cause, an opportunity for being angry without a cause might occur to us. For the end and aim of patience consists, not in being angry with a good reason, but in not being angry at all. Although I know that by some this very expression, \"without a cause,\" is taken to mean that he is angry without a cause who when he is angered is not allowed to seek for vengeance.
