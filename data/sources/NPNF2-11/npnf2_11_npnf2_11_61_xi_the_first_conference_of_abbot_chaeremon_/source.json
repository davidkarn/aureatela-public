For even if our coldness is known to you, and does not deserve to obtain what we are asking for, yet at least the trouble of so long a journey ought to be repaid by it, as we made haste to come here after our first beginning in the monastery of Bethlehem, owing to a longing for your instruction, and a yearning for our own good.","index":"33","references":[]}]},{"name":"Chapter VI.","index":8,"paragraphs":[{"text":" Abbot Chaeremon's statement that faults can be overcome in three ways.","index":"35","references":[]},{"text":"Then the blessed Chaeremon: There are, said he, three things which enable men to control their faults; viz., either the fear of hell or of laws even now imposed; or the hope and desire of the kingdom of heaven; or a liking for goodness itself and the love of virtue. For then we read that the fear of evil loathes contamination: \"The fear of the Lord hateth evil.\"[fn-51-P5138_1857760:7-nf] Hope also shuts out the assaults of all faults: for \"all who hope in Him shall not fail.\"[fn-51-P5139_1857869:8-nf] Love also fears no destruction from sins, for \"love never faileth;\"[fn-51-P5140_1857965:9-nf] and again: \"love covers a multitude of sins.\"[fn-51-P5141_1858031:10-nf] And therefore the blessed Apostle confines the whole sum of salvation in the attainment of those three virtues, saying \"Now abideth faith, hope, love, these three.\"[fn-51-P5142_1858216:11-nf] For faith is what makes us shun the stains of sin from fear of future judgment and punishment; hope is what withdraws our mind from present things, and despises all bodily pleasures from its expectation of heavenly rewards; love is what inflames us with keenness of heart for the love of Christ and the fruit of spiritual goodness, and makes us hate with a perfect hatred whatever is opposed to these. And these three things although they all seem to aim at one and the same end (for they incite us to abstain from things unlawful) yet they differ from each other greatly in the degrees of their excellence. For the two former belong properly to those men who in their aim at goodness have not yet acquired the love of virtue, and the third belongs specially to God and to those who have received into themselves the image and likeness of God. For He alone does the things that are good, with no fear and no thanks or reward to stir Him up, but simply from the love of goodness. For, as Solomon says, \"The Lord hath made all things for Himself.\"[fn-51-P5143_1859284:12-nf] For under cover of His own goodness He bestows all the fulness of good things on the worthy and the unworthy because He cannot be wearied by wrongs, nor be moved by passions at the sins of men, as He ever remains perfect goodness and unchangeable in His nature.","index":"36","references":[{"fn":"51","code":"P5138_1857760","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Prov. viii. 13.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","chapter":8,"verses":[13]}]},{"fn":"51","code":"P5139_1857869","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Ps. xxxiii.

I will then return to my father and will say unto him, `Father I have sinned against heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.'\"[fn-51-P5150_1861256:14-nf] But those words of humble penitence his father who ran to meet him received with greater affection than that with which they were spoken, and was not content to allow him lesser things, but passing through the two stages without delay restored him to his former dignity of sonship. We also ought forthwith to hasten on that by means of the indissoluble grace of love we may mount to that third stage of sonship, which believes that all that the father has is its own, and so we may be counted worthy to receive the image and likeness of our heavenly Father, and be able to say after the likeness of the true son: \"All that the Father hath is mine.\"[fn-51-P5151_1861929:15-nf] Which also the blessed Apostle declares of us, saying: \"All things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours.\"[fn-51-P5152_1862151:16-nf] And to this likeness the commands of our Saviour also summon us: \"Be ye,\" says He, \"perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect\"[fn-51-P5153_1862307:17-nf] For in these persons sometimes the love of goodness is found to be interrupted, when the vigour of the soul is relaxed by some coldness or joy or delight, and so loses either the fear of hell for the time, or the desire of future blessings. And there is indeed in these a stage leading to some advance, which affects us so that when from fear of punishment or from hope of reward we begin to avoid sin we are enabled to pass on to the stage of love, for \"fear,\" says one, \"is not in love, but perfect love casteth out fear: for fear hath torment, but he who fears is not perfect in love. We therefore love because God first loved us.\"[fn-51-P5154_1862964:18-nf] We can then only ascend to that true perfection when, as He first loved us for the grace of nothing but our salvation, we also have loved Him for the sake of nothing but His own love alone. Wherefore we must do our best to mount with perfect ardour of mind from this fear to hope, from hope to the love of God, and the love of the virtues themselves, that as we steadily pass on to the love of goodness itself, we may, as far as it is possible for human nature, keep firm hold of what is good.","index":"40","references":[{"fn":"51","code":"P5149_1859854","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"S.

For this condition can neither abuse an opportunity to sin when all human witnesses are absent, nor be corrupted by the secret allurements of thoughts, while, keeping in its very marrow the love of virtue itself, it not only does not admit into the heart anything that is opposed to it, but actually hates it with the utmost horror. For it is one thing for a man in his delight at some present good to hate the stains of sins and of the flesh, and another thing to check unlawful desires by contemplating the future reward; and it is one thing to fear present loss and another to dread future punishment. Lastly it is a much greater thing to be unwilling to forsake good for good's own sake, than it is to withhold consent from evil for fear of evil. For in the former case the good is voluntary, but in the latter it is constrained and as it were violently forced out of a reluctant party either by fear of punishment or by greed of reward. For one who abstains from the allurements of sin owing to fear, will whenever the obstacle of fear is removed, once more return to what he loves and thus will not continually acquire any stability in good, nor will he ever rest free from attacks because he will not secure the sure and lasting peace of chastity. For where there is the disturbance of warfare there cannot help being the danger of wounds. For one who is in the midst of the conflict, even though he is a warrior and by fighting bravely inflicts frequent and deadly wounds on his foes, must still sometimes be pierced by the point of the enemy's sword. But one who has defeated the attack of sins and is now in the enjoyment of the security of peace, and has passed on to the love of virtue itself, will keep this condition of good continually, as he is entirely wrapped up in it, because he believes that nothing can be worse than the loss of his inmost chastity. For he deems nothing dearer or more precious than present purity, to whom a dangerous departure from virtue or a poisonous stain of sin is a grievous punishment. To such an one, I say, neither will regard for the presence of another add anything to his goodness nor will solitude take anything away from it: but as always and everywhere he bears about with him his conscience as a judge not only of his actions but also of his thoughts, he will especially try to please it, as he knows that it cannot be cheated nor deceived, and that he cannot escape it.","index":"43","references":[]}]},{"name":"Chapter IX.","index":11,"paragraphs":[{"text":"That love not only makes sons out of servants, but also bestows the image and likeness of God.","index":"45","references":[]},{"text":"And if to anyone relying on the help of God and not on his own efforts, it has been vouch-safed to acquire this state, from the condition of a Servant, wherein is fear, and from a mercenary greed of hope, whereby there is sought not so much the good of the donor as the recompense of reward, he will begin to pass on to the adoption of sons, where there is no longer fear, nor greed, but that love which never faileth continually endures. Of which fear and love the Lord in chiding some shows what is befitting for each one: \"A son knoweth his own father, and a servant feareth his lord: And if I be a Father, where is My honour: and if I be a Lord, where is my fear?\"[fn-51-P5163_1867256:19-nf] For one who is a servant must needs fear because \"if knowing his lord's will he has done things worthy of stripes, he shall be beaten with many stripes.\"[fn-51-P5164_1867426:20-nf] Whoever then by this love has attained the image and likeness of God, will now delight in goodness for the pleasure of goodness itself, and having somehow a like feeling of patience and gentleness will henceforth be angered by no faults of sinners, but in his compassion and sympathy will rather ask for pardon for their infirmities, and, remembering that for so long he himself was tried by the stings of similar passions till by the Lord's mercy he was saved, will feel that, as he was saved from carnal attacks not by the teaching of his own exertions but by God's protection, not anger but pity ought to be shown to those who go astray; and with full peace of mind will he sing to God the following verse: \"Thou hast broken my chains. I will offer to Thee the sacrifice of praise;\" and: \"except the Lord had helped me, my soul had almost dwelt in hell.\"[fn-51-P5165_1868307:21-nf] And while he continues in this humility of mind he will be able even to fulfil this Evangelic command of perfection: \"Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that persecute you and slander you.\"[fn-51-P5166_1868584:22-nf] And so it will be vouchsafed to us to attain that reward which is subjoined, whereby we shall not only bear the image and likeness of God, but shall even be called sons: \"that ye may be,\" says He \"sons of your Father which is in heaven, Who maketh His sun to rise on the good and evil, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust:\"[fn-51-P5167_1868938:23-nf] and this feeling the blessed John knew that he had attained when he said: \"that we may have confidence in the day of judgment, because as He is so are we also in this world.\"[fn-51-P5168_1869126:24-nf] For in what can a weak and fragile human nature be like Him, except in always showing a calm love in its heart towards the good and evil, the just and the unjust, in imitation of God, and by doing good for the love of goodness itself, arriving at that true adoption of the sons of God, of which also the blessed Apostle speaks as follows: \"Every one that is born of God doeth not sin, for His seed is in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God;\" and again: \"We know that every one who is born of God sinneth not, but his birth of God preserves him, and the wicked one toucheth him not?\"[fn-51-P5169_1869743:25-nf] And this must be understood not of all kinds of sins, but only of mortal sins: and if any one will not extricate and cleanse himself from these, for him the aforesaid Apostle tells us in another place that we ought not even to pray, saying: \"If a man knows his brother to be sinning a sin not unto death, let him ask, and He will give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he should ask for it.\"[fn-51-P5170_1870216:26-nf] But of those which he says are not unto death, from which even those who serve Christ faithfully cannot, with whatever care they keep themselves, be free, of these he says: \"If we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us;\" and again: \"If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.\"[fn-51-P5171_1870583:27-nf] For it is an impossibility for any one of the saints not to fall into those trivial faults which are committed by word, and thought, and ignorance, and forgetfulness, and necessity, and will, and surprise: which though quite different from that sin which is said to be unto death, still cannot be free from fault and blame.","index":"46","references":[{"fn":"51","code":"P5163_1867256","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Mal. i. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"malachi","chapter":1,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"51","code":"P5164_1867426","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"S.

For no uniform crown of perfection can be offered to all men, because all have not the same virtue, or purpose, or fervour, and so the Divine Word has in some way appointed different ranks and different measures of perfection itself. And that this is so the variety of beatitudes in the gospel clearly shows. For though they are called blessed, whose is the kingdom of heaven, and blessed are they who shall possess the earth, and blessed are they who shall receive their consolation, and blessed are they who shall be filled, yet we believe that there is a great difference between the habitations of the kingdom of heaven, and the possession of the earth, whatever it be, and also between the reception of consolation and the fulness and satisfaction of righteousness; and that there is a great distinction between those who shall obtain mercy, and those who shall be deemed worthy to enjoy the most glorious vision of God. \"For there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for star differeth from star in glory, so also is the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-51-P5193_1875211:36-nf] While therefore in accordance with this rule holy Scripture praises those who fear God, and says \"Blessed are all they that fear the Lord,\"[fn-51-P5194_1875375:37-nf] and promises them for this a full measure of bliss, yet it says again: \"There is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear: for fear hath torment. But he that feareth is not yet perfect in love.\"[fn-51-P5195_1875611:38-nf] And again, though it is a grand thing to serve God, and it is said: \"Serve the Lord in fear;\" and: \"It is a great thing for thee to be called My servant;\" and: \"Blessed is that servant whom his Lord, when He cometh, shall find so doing,\"[fn-51-P5196_1875869:39-nf] yet it is said to the Apostles: \"I no longer call you servants, for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth: but I call you friends, for all things whatsoever I have heard from my Father, I have made known unto you.\"[fn-51-P5197_1876139:40-nf] And once more: \"Ye are My friends, if ye do whatever I command you.\"[fn-51-P5198_1876233:41-nf] You see then that there are different stages of perfection, and that we are called by the Lord from high things to still higher in such a way that he who has become blessed and perfect in the fear of God; going as it is written \"from strength to strength,\"[fn-51-P5199_1876511:42-nf] and from one perfection to another, i.e., mounting with keenness of soul from fear to hope, is summoned in the end to that still more blessed stage, which, is love, and he who has been \"a faithful and wise servant\"[fn-52-P5200_1876757:43-nf] will pass to the companionship of friendship and to the adoption of sons. So then our saying also must be understood according to this meaning: not that we say that the consideration of that enduring punishment or of that blessed recompense which is promised to the saints is of no value, but because, though they are useful and introduce those who pursue them to the first beginning of blessedness, yet again love, wherein is already fuller confidence, and a lasting joy, will remove them from servile fear and mercenary hope to the love of God, and carry them on to the adoption of sons, and somehow make them from being perfect still more perfect. For the Saviour says that in His Father's house are \"many mansions,\"[fn-52-P5201_1877501:44-nf] and although all the stars seem to be in the sky, yet there is a mighty difference between the brightness of the sun and of the moon, and between that of the morning star and the rest of the stars. And therefore the blessed Apostle prefers it not only above fear and hope but also above all gifts which are counted great and wonderful, and shows the way of love still more excellent than all. For when after finishing his list of spiritual gifts of virtues he wanted to describe its members, he began as follows: \"And yet I show unto you a still more excellent way. Though I speak with the tongues of men and angels, and though I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith so that I can remove mountains, and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profiteth me nothing.\" You see then that nothing more precious, nothing more perfect, nothing more sublime, and, if I may say so, nothing more enduring can be found than love. For \"whether there be prophecies, they shall fail, whether there be tongues, they shall cease, whether there be knowledge, it shall be destroyed,\" but \"love never faileth,\"[fn-52-P5202_1878734:45-nf] and without it not only those most excellent kinds of gifts, but even the glory of martyrdom itself will fail.","index":"56","references":[{"fn":"51","code":"P5193_1875211","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"1 Cor. xv. 41, 42.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":15,"verses":[41]}]},{"fn":"51","code":"P5194_1875375","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Ps. cxxvii.

And one of the prophets has finely described the grandeur of this fear, saying: \"Wisdom and knowledge are the riches of salvation: the fear of the Lord is his treasure.\"[fn-52-P5207_1879765:46-nf] He could not describe with greater clearness the worth and value of that fear than by saying that the riches of our salvation, which consist in true wisdom and knowledge of God, can only be preserved by the fear of the Lord. To this fear then not sinners but saints are invited by the prophetic word where the Psalmist says: \"O fear the Lord, all ye His Saints: for they that fear Him lack nothing.\"[fn-52-P5208_1880185:47-nf] For where a man fears the Lord with this fear it is certain that nothing is lacking to his perfection. For it was clearly of that other penal fear that the Apostle John said that \"He who feareth is not made perfect in love, for fear hath punishment.\"[fn-52-P5209_1880466:48-nf] There is then a great difference between this fear, to which nothing is lacking, which is the treasure of wisdom and knowledge, and that imperfect fear which is called \"the beginning of wisdom,\"[fn-52-P5210_1880681:49-nf] and which has in it punishment and so is expelled from the hearts of those who are perfect by the incoming of the fulness of love. For \"there is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear.\"[fn-52-P5211_1880903:50-nf] And in truth if the beginning of wisdom consists in fear, what will its perfection be except in the love Of Christ which, as it contains in it the fear which belongs to perfect love, is called not the beginning but the treasure of wisdom and knowledge? And therefore there is a twofold stage of fear. The one for beginners, i.e., for those who are still subject to the yoke and to servile terror; of which we read: \"And the servant shall fear his Lord;\"[fn-52-P5212_1881377:51-nf] and in the gospel: \"I no longer call you servants, for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth;\" and therefore \"the servant,\" He tells us, \"abideth not in the house for ever, but the Son abideth for ever.\"[fn-52-P5213_1881610:52-nf] For He is instructing us to pass on from that penal fear to the fullest freedom of love, and the confidence of the friends and sons of God. Finally the blessed Apostle, who had by the power of the Lord's love already passed through the servile stage of fear, scorns lower things and declares that he has been enriched with good things by the Lord, \"for God hath not given us\" he says \"a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind.\"[fn-52-P5214_1882090:53-nf] Those also who are inflamed with a perfect love of their heavenly Father, and whom the Divine adoption has already made sons instead of servants, he addresses in these words: \"For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.\"[fn-52-P5215_1882417:54-nf] It is of this fear too, that the prophet spoke when he would describe that sevenfold spirit, which according to the mystery of the Incarnation, full surely descended on the God man:[fn-52-P5216_1882619:55-nf] \"And there shall rest upon Him the Spirit of the Lord: the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the Spirit of counsel and of might, the Spirit of knowledge and of true godliness,\" and in the last place he adds as something special these words: \"And the Spirit of the fear of the Lord shall fill Him.\"[fn-52-P5217_1882984:56-nf] Where we must in the first place notice carefully that he does not say \"and there shall rest upon Him the Spirit of fear,\" as he said in the earlier cases, but he says \"there shall fill Him the Spirit of the fear of the Lord.\" For such is the greatness of its richness that when once it has seized on a man by its power, it takes possession not of a portion but of his whole mind. And not without good reason. For as it is closely joined to that love which \"never faileth,\" it not only fills the man, but takes a lasting and inseparable and continual possession of him in whom it has begun, and is not lessened by any allurements of temporal joy or delights, as is sometimes the case with that fear which is cast out. This then is the fear belonging to perfection, with which we are told that the God-man,[fn-52-P5218_1883810:57-nf] who came not only to redeem mankind, but also to give us a pattern of perfection and example of goodness, was filled. For the true Son of God \"who did no sin neither was guile found in His mouth,\"[fn-52-P5219_1884028:58-nf] could not feel that servile fear of punishment.","index":"59","references":[{"fn":"52","code":"P5207_1879765","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Is. xxxiii. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":33,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"52","code":"P5208_1880185","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Ps. xxxiii.
