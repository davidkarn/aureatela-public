Those persons who do not believe such declarations do their best to oppose to them false and illusive sophisms of their own, either contending that what is adduced from Scripture has another meaning, or altogether denying that it is an utterance of God's. For I suppose no man who understands what is written, and believes it to be communicated by the supreme and true God through holy men, refuses to yield and consent to these declarations, whether he orally confesses his consent, or is from some evil influence ashamed or afraid to do so; or even, with an opinionativeness closely resembling madness, makes strenuous efforts to defend what he knows and believes to be false against what he knows and believes to be true.","index":"35","references":[]},{"text":"That, therefore, which the whole Church of the true God holds and professes as its creed, that Christ shall come from heaven to judge quick and dead, this we call the last day, or last time, of the divine judgment. For we do not know how many days this judgment may occupy; but no one who reads the Scriptures, however negligently, need be told that in them \"day\" is customarily used for \"time.\" And when we speak of the day of God's judgment, we add the word last or final for this reason, because even now God judges, and has judged from the beginning of human history, banishing from paradise, and excluding from the tree of life, those first men who perpetrated so great a sin. Yea, He was certainly exercising judgment also when He did not spare the angels who sinned, whose prince, overcome by envy, seduced men after being himself seduced. Neither is it without God's profound and just judgment that the life of demons and men, the one in the air, the other on earth, is filled with misery, calamities, and mistakes. And even though no one had sinned, it could only have been by the good and right judgment of God that the whole rational creation could have been maintained in eternal blessedness by a persevering adherence to its Lord. He judges, too, not only in the mass, condemning the race of devils and the race of men to be miserable on account of the original sin of these races, but He also judges the voluntary and personal acts of individuals. For even the devils pray that they may not be tormented,[fn-37-P3774_2079151:1-nf] which proves that without injustice they might either be spared or tormented according to their deserts. And men are punished by God for their sins often visibly, always secretly, either in this life or after death, although no man acts rightly save by the assistance of divine aid; and no man or devil acts unrighteously save by the permission of the divine and most just judgment. For, as the apostle says, \"There is no unrighteousness with God;\"[fn-37-P3775_2079615:2-nf] and as he elsewhere says, \"His judgments are inscrutable, and His ways past finding out\"[fn-37-P3776_2079720:3-nf] In this book, then, I shall speak, as God permits, not of those first judgments, nor of these intervening judgments of God, but of the last judgment, when Christ is to come from heaven to judge the quick and the dead. For that day is properly called the day of judgment, because in it there shall be no room left for the ignorant questioning why this wicked person is happy and that righteous man unhappy. In that day true and full happiness shall be the lot of none but the good, while deserved and supreme misery shall be the portion of the wicked, and of them only.","index":"36","references":[{"fn":"37","code":"P3774_2079151","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"John v. 29.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":5,"verses":[29]}]},{"fn":"37","code":"P3775_2079615","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Rom. ix. 14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":9,"verses":[14]}]},{"fn":"37","code":"P3776_2079720","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Rom. xi. 33.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":11,"verses":[33]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 2.-That in the Mingled Web of Human Affairs God's Judgment is Present, Though It Cannot Be Discerned.","index":4,"paragraphs":[{"text":"In this present time we learn to bear with equanimity the ills to which even good men are subject, and to hold cheap the blessings which even the wicked enjoy. And consequently, even in those conditions of life in which the justice of God is not apparent, His teaching is salutary. For we do not know by what judgment of God this good man is poor and that bad man rich; why he who, in our opinion, ought to suffer acutely for his abandoned life enjoys himself, while sorrow pursues him whose praiseworthy life leads us to suppose he should be happy; why the innocent man is dismissed from the bar not only unavenged, but even condemned, being either wronged by the iniquity of the judge, or overwhelmed by false evidence, while his guilty adversary, on the other hand, is not only discharged with impunity, but even has his claims admitted; why the ungodly enjoys good health, while the godly pines in sickness; why ruffians are of the soundest constitution, while they who could not hurt any one even with a word are from infancy afflicted with complicated disorders; why he who is useful to society is cut off by premature death, while those who, as it might seem, ought never to have been so much as born have lives of unusual length; why he who is full of crimes is crowned with honors, while the blameless man is buried in the darkness of neglect. But who can collect or enumerate all the contrasts of this kind? But if this anomalous state of things were uniform in this life, in which, as the sacred Psalmist says, \"Man is like to vanity, his days as a shadow that passeth away,\"[fn-37-P3780_2082001:4-nf] -so uniform that none but wicked men won the transitory prosperity of earth, while only the good suffered its ills,-this could be referred to the just and even benign judgment of God. We might suppose that they who were not destined to obtain those everlasting benefits which constitute human blessedness were either deluded by transitory blessings as the just reward of their wickedness, or were, in God's mercy, consoled them, and that they who were not destined to suffer eternal torments were afflicted with temporal chastisement for their sins, or were stimulated to greater attainment in virtue. But now, as it is, since we not only see good men involved in the ills of life, and bad men enjoying the good of it, which seems unjust, but also that evil often overtakes evil men, and good surprises the good, the rather on this account are God's judgments unsearchable, and His ways past finding out. Although, therefore, we do not know by what judgment these things are done or permitted to be done by God, with whom is the highest virtue, the highest wisdom, the highest justice, no infirmity, no rashness, no unrighteousness, yet it is salutary for us to learn to hold cheap such things, be they good or evil, as attach indifferently to good men and bad, and to covet those good things which belong only to good men, and flee those evils which belong only to evil men. But when we shall have come to that judgment, the date of which is called peculiarly the day of judgment, and sometimes the day of the Lord, we shall then recognize the justice of all God's judgments, not only of such as shall then be pronounced, but, of all which take effect from the beginning, or may take effect before that time. And in that day we shall also recognize with what justice so many, or almost all, the just judgments of God in the present life defy the scrutiny of human sense or insight, though in this matter it is not concealed from pious minds that what is concealed is just.","index":"38","references":[{"fn":"37","code":"P3780_2082001","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Ps. cxliv. 4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":144,"verses":[4]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 3.-What Solomon, in the Book of Ecclesiastes, Says Regarding the Things Which Happen Alike to Good and Wicked Men.","index":5,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Solomon, the wisest king of Israel, who reigned in Jerusalem, thus commences the book called Ecclesiastes, which the Jews number among their canonical Scriptures: \"Vanity of vanities, said Ecclesiastes, vanity of vanities; all is vanity. What profit hath a man of all his labor which he hath taken under the sun?\"[fn-37-P3784_2084427:5-nf] And after going on to enumerate, with this as his text, the calamities and delusions of this life, and the shifting nature of the present time, in which there is nothing substantial, nothing lasting, he bewails, among the other vanities that are under the sun, this also, that though wisdom excelleth folly as light excelleth darkness, and though the eyes of the wise man are in his head, while the fool walketh in darkness,[fn-37-P3785_2084873:6-nf] yet one event happeneth to them all, that is to say, in this life under the sun, unquestionably alluding to those evils which we see befall good and bad men alike. He says, further, that the good suffer the ills of life as if they were evil doers, and the bad enjoy the good of life as if they were good. \"There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked: again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous. I said, that this also is vanity.\"[fn-37-P3786_2085457:7-nf] This wisest man devoted this whole book to a full exposure of this vanity, evidently with no other object than that we might long for that life in which there is no vanity under the sun, but verity under Him who made the sun. In this vanity, then, was it not by the just and righteous judgment of God that man, made like to vanity, was destined to pass away? But in these days of vanity it makes an important difference whether he resists or yields to the truth, and whether he is destitute of true piety or a partaker of it,-important not so far as regards the acquirement of the blessings or the evasion of the calamities of this transitory and vain life, but in connection with the future judgment which shall make over to good men good things, and to bad men bad things, in permanent, inalienable possession. In fine, this wise man concludes this book of his by saying, \"Fear God, and keep His commandments: for this is every man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every despised person, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.\"[fn-37-P3787_2086531:8-nf] What truer, terser, more salutary enouncement could be made? \"Fear God, he says, and keep His commandments: for this is every man.\" For whosoever has real existence, is this, is a keeper of God's commandments; and he who is not this, is nothing. For so long as he remains in the likeness of vanity, he is not renewed in the image of the truth. \"For God shall bring into judgment every work,\"-that is, whatever man does in this life,-\"whether it be good or whether it be evil, with every despised person,\"-that is, with every man who here seems despicable, and is therefore not considered; for God sees even him and does not despise him nor pass him over in His judgment.","index":"40","references":[{"fn":"37","code":"P3784_2084427","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Eccles. i. 2. 3.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"37","code":"P3785_2084873","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Eccles. ii. 13, 14.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"37","code":"P3786_2085457","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Eccles. viii. 14.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"37","code":"P3787_2086531","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Eccles. xii. 13, 14.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 4.-That Proofs of the Last Judgment Will Be Adduced, First from the New Testament, and Then from the Old.","index":6,"paragraphs":[{"text":"The proofs, then, of this last judgment of God which I propose to adduce shall be drawn first from the New Testament, and then from the Old.

Therefore they shall be your judges.\"[fn-38-P3803_2091348:16-nf] Neither ought we to suppose that only twelve men shall judge along with Him, though He says that they shall sit upon twelve thrones; for by the number twelve is signified the completeness of the multitude of those who shall judge. For the two parts of the number seven (which commonly symbolizes totality), that is to say four and three, multiplied into one another, give twelve. For four times three, or three times four, are twelve. There are other meanings, too, in this number twelve. Were not this the right interpretation of the twelve thrones, then since we read that Matthias was ordained an apostle in the room of Judas the traitor, the Apostle Paul, though he labored more than them all,[fn-38-P3804_2092067:17-nf] should have no throne of judgment; but he unmistakeably considers himself to be included in the number of the judges when he says, \"Know ye not that we shall judge angels?\"[fn-38-P3805_2092258:18-nf] The same rule is to be observed in applying the number twelve to those who are to be judged. For though it was said, \"judging the twelve tribes of Israel,\" the tribe of Levi, which is the thirteenth, shall not on this account be exempt from judgment, neither shall judgment be passed only on Israel and not on the other nations.

For when He speaks even of this, He often uses language which is applicable to the end of the world and that last and great day of judgment, so that these two events cannot be distinguished unless all the corresponding passages bearing on the subject in the three evangelists, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, are compared with one another,-for some things are put more obscurely by one evangelist and more plainly by another,-so that it becomes apparent what things are meant to be referred to one event.

For after saying, \"The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: that all men should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father: he that honoreth not the Son, honoreth not the Father which hath sent Him;\" He immediately adds, \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word and believeth on Him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment; but is passed from death to life.\"[fn-38-P3810_2095332:21-nf] Here He said that believers on Him should not come into judgment.

For in this first resurrection none have a part save those who shall be eternally blessed; but in the second, of which He goes on to speak, all, as we shall learn, have a part, both the blessed and the wretched.

For some kind of life they must have in order to hear, and come forth from the graves in their rising bodies.

They have done evil because their life has been evil; and their life has been evil because it has not been renewed in the first or spiritual resurrection which now is, or because they have not persevered to the end in their renewed life. As, then, there are two regenerations, of which I have already made mention,-the one according to faith, and which takes place in the present life by means of baptism; the other according to the flesh, and which shall be accomplished in its incorruption and immortality by means of the great and final judgment,-so are there also two resurrections,-the one the first and spiritual resurrection, which has place in this life, and preserves us from coming into the second death; the other the second, which does not occur now, but in the end of the world, and which is of the body, not of the soul, and which by the last judgment shall dismiss some into the second death, others into that life which has no death.","index":"51","references":[{"fn":"38","code":"P3819_2098835","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"John v. 28, 29.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":5,"verses":[28]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 7.-What is Written in the Revelation of John Regarding the Two Resurrections, and the Thousand Years, and What May Reasonably Be Held on These Points.","index":9,"paragraphs":[{"text":"The evangelist John has spoken of these two resurrections in the book which is called the Apocalypse, but in such a way that some Christians do not understand the first of the two, and so construe the passage into ridiculous fancies.

It was then for the binding of this strong one that the apostle saw in the Apocalypse \"an angel coming down from heaven, having the key of the abyss, and a chain in his hand. And he laid hold,\" he says, \"on the dragon, that old serpent, which is called the devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,\"-that is, bridled and restrained his power so that he could not seduce and gain possession of those who were to be freed. Now the thousand years may be understood in two ways, so far as occurs to me: either because these things happen in the sixth thousand of years or sixth millennium (the latter part of which is now passing), as if during the sixth day, which is to be followed by a Sabbath which has no evening, the endless rest of the saints, so that, speaking of a part under the name of the whole, he calls the last part of the millennium-the part, that is, which had yet to expire before the end of the world-a thousand years; or he used the thousand years as an equivalent for the whole duration of this world, employing the number of perfection to mark the fullness of time. For a thousand is the cube of ten. For ten times ten makes a hundred, that is; the square on a plane superficies. But to give this superficies height, and make it a cube, the hundred is again multiplied by ten, which gives a thousand.

And for the same reason we cannot better interpret the words of the psalm, \"He hath been mindful of His covenant for ever, the word which He commanded to a thousand generations,\"[fn-38-P3832_2106740:35-nf] than by understanding it to mean \"to all generations.\"","index":"54","references":[{"fn":"38","code":"P3829_2104412","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Mark iii. 27; \"Vasa\" for \"goods.\"","bible_refs":[{"book":"mark","chapter":3,"verses":[27]},{"book":"mark","chapter":3,"verses":[27]}]},{"fn":"38","code":"P3830_2106206","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Matt. xix. 29.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":19,"verses":[29]}]},{"fn":"38","code":"P3831_2106343","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"2 Cor. vi. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":6,"verses":[10]}]},{"fn":"38","code":"P3832_2106740","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Ps. cv. 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":105,"verses":[8]}]}]},{"text":"\"And he cast him into the abyss,\"-i.e., cast the devil into the abyss.

For that man is more abundantly possessed by the devil who is not only alienated from God, but also gratuitously hates those who serve God. \"And shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years should be fulfilled.\" \"Shut him up,\"-i.e., prohibited him from going out, from doing what was forbidden. And the addition of \"set a seal upon him\" seems to me to mean that it was designed to keep it a secret who belonged to the devil's party and who did not. For in this world this is a secret, for we cannot tell whether even the man who seems to stand shall fall, or whether he who seems to lie shall rise again. But by the chain and prison-house of this interdict the devil is prohibited and restrained from seducing those nations which belong to Christ, but which he formerly seduced or held in subjection. For before the foundation of the world God chose to rescue these from the power of darkness, and to translate them into the kingdom of the Son of His love, as the apostle says.[fn-38-P3834_2108231:36-nf] For what Christian is not aware that he seduces nations even now, and draws them with himself to eternal punishment, but not those predestined to eternal life?

The devil, then, is bound and shut up in the abyss that he may not seduce the nations from which the Church is gathered, and which he formerly seduced before the Church existed. For it is not said \"that he should not seduce any man,\" but \"that he should not seduce the nations\"-meaning, no doubt, those among which the Church exists-\"till the thousand years should be fulfilled,\"-i.e., either what remains of the sixth day which consists of a thousand years, or all the years which are to elapse till the end of the world.","index":"55","references":[{"fn":"38","code":"P3834_2108231","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Col. i. 13.","bible_refs":[{"book":"colossians","chapter":1,"verses":[13]}]},{"fn":"38","code":"P3835_2108606","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"2 Tim. ii. 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 timothy","chapter":2,"verses":[19]}]}]},{"text":"The words, \"that he should not seduce the nations till the thousand years should be fulfilled,\" are not to be understood as indicating that afterwards. he is to seduce only those nations from which the predestined Church is composed, and from seducing whom he is restrained by that chain and imprisonment; but they are used in conformity with that usage frequently employed in Scripture and exemplified in the psalm, \"So our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until He have mercy upon us,\"[fn-38-P3837_2109987:38-nf] -not as if the eyes of His servants Would no longer wait upon the Lord their God when He had mercy upon them.

And yet there shall be a Church in this world even when the devil shall be loosed, as there has been since the beginning, and shall be always, the places of the dying being filled by new believers. For a little after John says that the devil, being loosed, shall draw the nations whom he has seduced in the whole world to make war against the Church, and that the number of these enemies shall be as the sand of the sea. \"And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them.

The devil, then, is not bound during the whole time which this book embraces,-that is, from the first coming of Christ to the end of the world, when He shall come the second time,-not bound in this sense, that during this interval, which goes by the name of a thousand years, he shall not seduce the Church, for not even when loosed shall he seduce it. For certainly if his being bound means that he is not able or not permitted to seduce the Church, what can the loosing of him mean but his being able or permitted to do so? But God forbid that such should be the case! But the binding of the devil is his being prevented from the exercise of his whole power to seduce men, either by violently forcing or fraudulently deceiving them into taking part with him.

For the Almighty does not absolutely seclude the saints from his temptation, but shelters only their inner man, where faith resides, that by outward temptation they may grow in grace. And He binds him that he may not, in the free and eager exercise of his malice, hinder or destroy the faith of those countless weak persons, already believing or yet to believe, from whom the Church must be increased and completed; and he will in the end loose him, that the city of God may see how mighty an adversary it has conquered, to the great glory of its Redeemer, Helper, Deliverer. And what are we in comparison with those believers and saints who shall then exist, seeing that they shall be tested by the loosing of an enemy with whom we make war at the greatest peril even when he is bound? Although it is also certain that even in this intervening period there have been and are some soldiers of Christ so wise and strong, that if they were to be alive in this mortal condition at the time of his loosing, they would both most wisely guard against, and most patiently endure, all his snares and assaults.","index":"59","references":[]},{"text":"Now the devil was thus bound not only when the Church began to be more and more widely extended among the nations beyond Judea, but is now and shall be bound till the end of the world, when he is to be loosed. Because even now men are, and doubtless to the end of the world shall be, converted to the faith from the unbelief in which he held them. And this strong one is bound in each instance in which he is spoiled of one of his goods; and the abyss in which he is shut up is not at an end when those die who were alive when first he was shut up in it, but these have been succeeded, and shall to the end of the world be succeeded, by others born after them with a like hate of the Christians, and in the depth of whose blind hearts he is continually shut up as in an abyss. But it is a question whether, during these three years and six months when he shall be loose, and raging with all his force, any one who has not previously believed shall attach himself to the faith. For how in that case would the words hold good, \"Who entereth into the house of a strong one to spoil his goods, unless first he shall have bound the strong one?\" Consequently this verse seems to compel us to believe that during that time, short as it is, no one will be added to the Christian community, but that the devil will make war with those who have previously become Christians, and that, though some of these may be conquered and desert to the devil, these do not belong to the predestinated number of the sons of God. For it is not without reason that John, the same apostle as wrote this Apocalypse, says in his epistle regarding certain persons, \"They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have remained with us.\"[fn-38-P3844_2116620:40-nf] But what shall become of the little ones? For it is beyond all belief that in these days there shall not be found some Christian children born, but not yet baptized, and that there shall not also be some born during that very period; and if there be such, we cannot believe that their parents shall not find some way of bringing them to the laver of regeneration. But if this shall be the case, how shall these goods be snatched from the devil when he is loose, since into his house no man enters to spoil his goods unless he has first bound him? On the contrary, we are rather to believe that in these days there shall be no lack either of those who fall away from, or of those who attach themselves to the Church; but there shall be such resoluteness, both in parents to seek baptism for their little ones, and in those who shall then first believe, that they shall conquer that strong one, even though unbound,-that is, shall both vigilantly comprehend, and patiently bear up against him, though employing such wiles and putting forth such force as he never before used; and thus they shall be snatched from him even though unbound. And yet the verse of the Gospel will not be untrue, \"Who entereth into the house of the strong one to spoil his goods, unless he shall first have bound the strong one?\" For in accordance with this true saying that order is observed-the strong one first bound, and then his goods spoiled; for the Church is so increased by the weak and strong from all nations far and near, that by its most robust faith in things divinely predicted and accomplished, it shall be able to spoil the goods of even the unbound devil. For as we must own that, \"when iniquity abounds, the love of many waxes cold,\"[fn-38-P3845_2118369:41-nf] and that those who have not been written in the book of life shall in large numbers yield to the severe and unprecedented persecutions and stratagems of the devil now loosed, so we cannot but think that not only those whom that time shall find sound in the faith, but also some who till then shall be without, shall become firm in the faith they have hitherto rejected and mighty to conquer the devil even though unbound, God's grace aiding them to understand the Scriptures, in which, among other things, there is foretold that very end which they themselves see to be arriving. And if this shall be so, his binding is to be spoken of as preceding, that there might follow a spoiling of him both bound and loosed; for it is of this it is said, \"Who shall enter into the house of the strong one to spoil his goods, unless he shall first have bound the strong one?\"","index":"60","references":[{"fn":"38","code":"P3844_2116620","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"1 John ii. 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 john","chapter":2,"verses":[19]}]},{"fn":"38","code":"P3845_2118369","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Matt. xxiv. 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":24,"verses":[12]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 9.-What the Reign of the Saints with Christ for a Thousand Years Is, and How It Differs from the Eternal Kingdom.","index":11,"paragraphs":[{"text":"But while the devil is bound, the saints reign with Christ during the same thousand years, understood in the same way, that is, of the time of His first coming.[fn-38-P3849_2119537:42-nf] For, leaving out of account that kingdom concerning which He shall say in the end, \"Come, ye blessed of my Father, take possession of the kingdom prepared for you,\"[fn-38-P3850_2119744:43-nf] the Church could not now be called His kingdom or the kingdom of heaven unless His saints were even now reigning with Him, though in another and far different way; for to His saints He says, \"Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.\"[fn-38-P3851_2120013:44-nf] Certainly it is in this present time that the scribe well instructed in the kingdom of God, and of whom we have already spoken, brings forth from his treasure things new and old.

The Son of man shall send His angels, and they shall gather out of His kingdom all offenses.\"[fn-38-P3852_2120635:45-nf] Can He mean out of that kingdom in which are no offenses?

Consequently, where both classes exist, it is the Church as it now is, but where only the one shall exist, it is the Church as it is destined to be when no wicked person shall be in her. Therefore the Church even now is the kingdom of Christ, and the kingdom of heaven. Accordingly, even now His saints reign with Him, though otherwise than as they shall reign hereafter; and yet, though the tares grow in the Church along with the wheat, they do not reign with Him. For they reign with Him who do what the apostle says, \"If ye be risen with Christ, mind the things which are above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God.

For, after saying that the devil is bound a thousand years and is afterwards loosed for a short season, it goes on to give a sketch of what the Church does or of what is done in the Church in those days, in the words, \"And I saw seats and them that sat upon them, and judgment was given.\" It is not to be supposed that this refers to the last judgment, but to the seats of the rulers and to the rulers themselves by whom the Church is now governed.

For why are these things practised, if not because the faithful, even though dead, are His members?

For even before this he was wont to use as many and various seductions as he could continue. And the words \"he shall go out\" mean, he shall burst forth from lurking hatred into open persecution.

The meaning of these names we find to be, Cog, \"a roof,\" Magog, \"from a roof,\"-a house, as it were, and he who comes out of the house. They are therefore the nations in which we found that the devil was shut up as in an abyss, and the devil himself coming out from them and going forth, so that they are the roof, he from the roof.

And consequently wherever the Church shall be,-and it shall be in all nations, as is signified by \"the breadth of the earth,\"-there also shall be the camp of the saints and the beloved city, and there it shall be encompassed by the savage persecution of all its enemies; for they too shall exist along with it in all nations,-that is, it shall be straitened, and hard pressed, and shut up in the straits of tribulation, but shall not desert its military duty, which is signified by the word \"camp.\"","index":"69","references":[]}]},{"name":"Chapter 12.-Whether the Fire that Came Down Out of Heaven and Devoured Them Refers to the Last Punishment of the Wicked.","index":14,"paragraphs":[{"text":"The words, \"And fire came down out of heaven and devoured them,\" are not to be understood of the final punishment which shall be inflicted when it is said, \"Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire;\"[fn-38-P3885_2134877:66-nf] for then they shall be cast into the fire, not fire come down out of heaven upon them.

Though this time is brief, yet not without reason is it questioned whether it is comprehended in the thousand years in which the devil is bound and the saints reign with Christ, or whether this little season should be added over and above to these years. For if we say that they are included in the thousand years, then the saints reign with Christ during a more protracted period than the devil is bound. For they shall reign with their King and Conqueror mightily even in that crowning persecution when the devil shall now be unbound and shall rage against them with all his might. How then does Scripture define both the binding of the devil and the reign of the saints by the same thousand years, if the binding of the devil ceases three years and six months before this reign of the saints with Christ? On the other hand, if we say that the brief space of this persecution is not to be reckoned as a part of the thousand years, but rather as an additional period, we shall indeed be able to interpret the words, \"The priests of God and of Christ shall reign with Him a thousand years; and when the thousand years shall be finished, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison;\" for thus they signify that the reign of the saints and the bondage of the devil shall cease simultaneously, so that the time of the persecution we speak of should be contemporaneous neither with the reign of the saints nor with the imprisonment of Satan, but should be reckoned over and above as a superadded portion of time. But then in this case we are forced to admit that the saints shall not reign with Christ during that persecution. But who can dare to say that His members shall not reign with Him at that very juncture when they shall most of all, and with the greatest fortitude, cleave to Him, and when the glory of resistlance and the crown of martyrdom shall be more conspicuous in proportion to the hotness of the battle? Or if it is suggested that they may be said not to reign, because of the tribulations which they shall suffer, it will follow that all the saints who have formerly, during the thousand years, suffered tribulation, shall not be said to have reigned with Christ during the period of their tribulation, and consequently even those whose souls the author of this book says that he saw, and who were slain for the testimony of Jesus and the word of God, did not reign with Christ when they were suffering persecution, and they were not themselves the kingdom of Christ, though Christ was then pre-eminently possessing them. This is indeed perfectly absurd, and to be scouted. But assuredly the victorious souls of the glorious martyrs having overcome and finished all griefs and toils, and having laid down their mortal members, have reigned and do reign with Christ till the thousand years are finished, that they may afterwards reign with Him when they have received their immortal bodies. And therefore during these three years and a half the souls of those who were slain for His testimony, both those which formerly passed from the body and those which shall pass in that last persecution, shall reign with Him till the mortal world come to an end, and pass into that kingdom in which there shall be no death. And thus the reign of the saints with Christ shall last longer than the bonds and imprisonment of the devil, because they shall reign with their King the Son of God for these three years and a half during which the devil is no longer bound. It remains, therefore, that when we read that \"the priests of God and of Christ shall reign with Him a thousand years; and when the thousand years are finished, the devil shall be loosed from his imprisonment,\" that we understand either that the thousand years of the reign of the saints does not terminate, though the imprisonment of the devil does,-so that both parties have their thousand years, that is, their complete time, yet each with a different actual duration approriate to itself, the kingdom of the saints being longer, the imprisonment of the devil shorter, -or at least that, as three years and six months is a very short time, it is not reckoned as either deducted from the whole time of Satan's imprisonment, or as added to the whole duration of the reign of the saints, as we have shown above in the sixteenth book[fn-38-P3892_2140797:70-nf] regarding the round number of four hundred years, which were specified as four hundred, though actually somewhat more; and similar expressions are often found in the sacred writings, if one will mark them.","index":"73","references":[{"fn":"38","code":"P3892_2140797","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Ch. 24.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 14.-Of the Damnation of the Devil and His Adherents; And a Sketch of the Bodily Resurrection of All the Dead, and of the Final Retributive Judgment.","index":16,"paragraphs":[{"text":"After this mention of the closing persecution, he summarily indicates all that the devil, and the city of which he is the prince, shall suffer in the last judgment. For he says, \"And the devil who seduced them is cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, in which are the beast and the false prophet, and they shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.\" We have already said that by the beast is well understood the wicked city. His false prophet is either Antichrist or that image or figment of which we have spoken in the same place. After this he gives a brief narrative of the last judgment itself, which shall take place at the second or bodily resurrection of the dead, as it had been revealed to him: \"I saw a throne great and white, and One sitting on it from whose face the heaven and the earth fled away, and their place was not found.\" He does not say, \"I saw a throne great and white, and One sitting on it, and from His face the heaven and the earth fled away,\" for it had not happened then, i.e., before the living and the dead were judged; but he says that he saw Him sitting on the throne from whose face heaven and earth fled away, but afterwards. For when the judgment is finished, this heaven and earth shall cease to be, and there will be a new heaven and a new earth. For this world shall pass away by transmutation, not by absolute destruction. And therefore the apostle says, \"For the figure of this world passeth away. I would have you be without anxiety.\"[fn-38-P3896_2142661:71-nf] The figure, therefore, passes away, not the nature. After John had said that he had seen One sitting on the throne from whose face heaven and earth fled, though not till afterwards, he said, \"And I saw the dead, great and small: and the books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of the life of each man: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their deeds.\" He said that the books were opened, and a book; but he left us at a loss as to the nature of this book, \"which is,\" he says, \"the book of the life of each man.\" By those books, then, which he first mentioned, we are to understand the sacred books old and new, that out of them it might be shown what commandments God had enjoined; and that book of the life of each man is to show what commandments each man has done or omitted to do. If this book be materially considered, who can reckon its size or length, or the time it would take to read a book in which the whole life of every man is recorded? Shall there be present as many angels as men, and shall each man hear his life recited by the angel assigned to him? In that case there will be not one book containing all the lives, but a separate book for every life. But our passage requires us to think of one only. \"And another book was opened,\" it says. We must therefore understand it of a certain divine power, by which it shall be brought about that every one shall recall to memory all his own works, whether good or evil, and shall mentally survey them with a marvellous rapidity, so that this knowledge will either accuse or excuse conscience, and thus all and each shall be simultaneously judged. And this divine power is called a book, because in it we shall as it were read all that it causes us to remember. That he may show who the dead, small and great, are who are to be judged, he recurs to this which he had omitted or rather deferred, and says, \"And the sea presented the dead which were in it; and death and hell gave up the dead which were in them.\" This of course took place before the dead were judged, yet it is mentioned after. And so, I say, he returns again to what he had omitted. But now he preserves the order of events, and for the sake of exhibiting it repeats in its own proper place what he had already said regarding the dead who were judged. For after he had said, \"And the sea presented the dead which were in it, and death and hell gave up the dead which were in them,\" he immediately subjoined what he had already said, \"and they were judged every man according to their works.\" For this is just what he had said before, \"And the dead were judged according to their works.\"","index":"75","references":[{"fn":"38","code":"P3896_2142661","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"1 Cor. vii. 31, 32.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":7,"verses":[31]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 15.-Who the Dead are Who are Given Up to Judgment by the Sea, and by Death and Hell.","index":17,"paragraphs":[{"text":" But who are the dead which were in the sea, and which the sea presented? For we cannot suppose that those who die in the sea are not in hell, nor that their bodies are preserved in the sea; nor yet, which is still more absurd, that the sea retained the good, while hell received the bad. Who could believe this? But some very sensibly suppose that in this place the sea is put for this world. When John then wished to signify that those whom Christ should find still alive in the body were to be judged along with those who should rise again, he called them dead, both the good to whom it is said, \"For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God,\"[fn-39-P3900_2146134:72-nf] and the wicked of whom it is said, \"Let the dead bury their dead.\"[fn-39-P3901_2146219:73-nf] They may also be called dead, because they wear mortal bodies, as the apostle says, \"The body indeed is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness;\"[fn-39-P3902_2146416:74-nf] proving that in a living man in the body there is both a body which is dead, and a spirit which is life. Yet he did not say that the body was mortal, but dead, although immediately after he speaks in the more usual way of mortal bodies. These, then, are the dead which were in the sea, and which the sea presented, to wit, the men who were in this world, because they had not yet died, and whom the world presented for judgment. \"And death and hell,\" he says, \"gave up the dead which were in them.\" The sea presented them because they had merely to be found in the place where they were; but death and hell gave them up or restored them, because they called them back to life, which they had already quitted. And perhaps it was not without reason that neither death nor hell were judged sufficient alone, and both were mentioned,-death to indicate the good, who have suffered only death and not hell; hell to indicate the wicked, who suffer also the punishment of hell. For if it does not seem absurd to believe that the ancient saints who believed in Christ and His then future coming, were kept in places far removed indeed from the torments of the wicked, but yet in hell,[fn-39-P3903_2147612:75-nf] until Christ's blood and His descent into these places delivered them, certainly good Christians, redeemed by that precious price already paid, are quite unacquainted with hell while they wait for their restoration to the body, and the reception of their reward. After saying, \"They were judged every man according to their works,\" he briefly added what the judgment was: \"Death and hell were cast into the lake of fire;\" by these names designating the devil and the whole company of his angels, for he is the author of death and the pains of hell. For this is what he had already, by anticipation, said in clearer language: \"The devil who seduced them was cast into a lake of fire and brimstone.\" The obscure addition he had made in the words, \"in which were also the beast and the false prophet,\" he here explains, \"They who were not found written in the book of life were cast into the lake of fire.\" This book is not for reminding God, as if things might escape Him by forgetfulness, but it symbolizes His predestination of those to whom eternal life shall be given.

Therefore the whole, or almost the whole, of the gusty atmosphere (which he calls heaven, or rather the heavens, meaning the earth's atmosphere, and not the upper air in which sun, moon, and stars are set) was turned into moisture, and in this way perished together with the earth, whose former appearance had been destroyed by the deluge. \"But the heavens and the earth which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.\" Therefore the heavens and the earth, or the world which was preserved from the water to stand in place of that world which perished in the flood, is itself reserved to fire at last in the day of the judgment and perdition of ungodly men. He does not hesitate to affirm that in this great change men also shall perish: their nature, however, shall notwithstanding continue, though in eternal punishments. Some one will perhaps put the question, If after judgment is pronounced the world itself is to burn, where shall the saints be during the conflagration, and before it is replaced by a new heavens and a new earth, since somewhere they must be, because they have material bodies? We may reply that they shall be in the upper regions into which the flame of that conflagration shall not ascend, as neither did the water of the flood; for they shall have such bodies that they shall be wherever they wish.

And hence some suppose that he shall rise again and be Antichrist. Others, again, suppose that he is not even dead, but that he was concealed that he might be supposed to have been killed, and that he now lives in concealment in the vigor of that same age which he had reached when he was believed to have perished, and will live until he is revealed in his own time and restored to his kingdom.[fn-39-P3936_2161605:94-nf] But I wonder that men can be so audacious in their conjectures. However, it is not absurd to believe that these words of the apostle, \"Only he who now holdeth, let him hold until he be taken out of the way,\" refer to the Roman empire, as if it were said, \"Only he who now reigneth, let him reign until he be taken out of the way.\" \"And then shall the wicked be revealed:\" no one doubts that this means Antichrist. But others think that the words, \"Ye know what withholdeth,\" and \"The mystery of iniquity worketh,\" refer only to the wicked and the hypocrites who are in the Church, until they reach a number so great as to furnish Antichrist with a great people, and that this is the mystery of iniquity, because it seems hidden; also that the apostle is exhorting the faithful tenaciously to hold the faith they hold when he says, \"Only he who now holdeth, let him hold until he be taken out of the way,\" that is, until the mystery of iniquity which now is hidden departs from the Church. For they suppose that it is to this same mystery John alludes when in his epistle he says, \"Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that Antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.

That which there is no doubt he said is this, that Christ will not come to judge quick and dead unless Antichrist, His adversary, first come to seduce those who are dead in soul; although their seduction is a result of God's secret judgment already passed. For, as it is said \"his presence shall be after the working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders, and with all seduction of unrighteousness in them that perish.\" For then shall Satan be loosed, and by means of that Antichrist shall work with all power in a lying though a wonderful manner. It is commonly questioned whether these works are called \"signs and lying wonders\" because he is to deceive men's senses by false appearances, or because the things he does, though they be true prodigies, shall be a lie to those who shall believe that such things could be done only by God, being ignorant of the devil's power, and especially of such unexampled power as he shall then for the first time put forth. For when he fell from heaven as fire, and at a stroke swept away from the holy Job his numerous household and his vast flocks, and then as a whirlwind rushed upon and smote the house and killed his children, these were not deceitful appearances, and yet they were the works of Satan to whom God had given this power. Why they are called signs and lying wonders, we shall then be more likely to know when the time itself arrives. But whatever be the reason of the name, they shall be such signs and wonders as shall seduce those who shall deserve to be seduced, \"because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved.\" Neither did the apostle scruple to go on to say, \"For this cause God shall send upon them the working of error that they should believe a lie.\" For God shall send, because God shall permit the devil to do these things, the permission being by His own just judgment, though the doing of them is in pursuance of the devil's unrighteous and malignant purpose, \"that they all might be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.\" Therefore, being judged, they shall be seduced, and, being seduced, they shall be judged. But, being judged, they shall be seduced by those secretly just and justly secret judgments of God, with which He has never ceased to judge since the first sin of the rational creatures; and, being seduced, they shall be judged in that last and manifest judgment administered by Jesus Christ, who was Himself most unjustly judged and shall most justly judge.

For we cannot say that it is impossible that they should both die and revive again while they are carried aloft through the air.

For we shall go to meet Him as He comes, not where He remains; but \"so shall we be with the Lord,\" that is, we shall be with Him possessed of immortal bodies wherever we shall be with Him. We seem compelled to take the words in this sense, and to suppose that those whom the Lord shall find alive upon earth shall in that brief space both suffer death and receive immortality: for this same apostle says, \"In Christ shall all be made alive;\"[fn-39-P3944_2167622:97-nf] while, speaking of the same resurrection of the body, he elsewhere says, \"That which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die.\"[fn-39-P3945_2167773:98-nf] How, then, shall those whom Christ shall find alive upon earth be made alive to immortality in Him if they die not, since on this very account it is said, \"That which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die?\" Or if we cannot properly speak of human bodies as sown, unless in so far as by dying they do in some sort return to the earth, as also the sentence pronounced by God against the sinning father of the human race runs, \"Earth thou art, and unto earth shalt thou return,\"[fn-39-P3946_2168275:99-nf] we must acknowledge that those whom Christ at His coming shall find still in the body are not included in these words of the apostle nor in those of Genesis; for, being caught up into the clouds, they are certainly not sown, neither going nor returning to the earth, whether they experience no death at all or die for a moment in the air.","index":"91","references":[{"fn":"39","code":"P3944_2167622","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"1 Cor. xv. 22.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":15,"verses":[22]}]},{"fn":"39","code":"P3945_2167773","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"1 Cor. xv. 36.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":15,"verses":[36]}]},{"fn":"39","code":"P3946_2168275","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Gen. iii. 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":3,"verses":[19]}]}]},{"text":"But, on the other hand, there meets us the saying of the same apostle when he was speaking to the Corinthians about the resurrection of the body, \"We shall all rise,\" or, as other mss. read, \"We shall all sleep.\"[fn-39-P3948_2168846:100-nf] Since, then, there can be no resurrection unless death has preceded, and since we can in this passage understand by sleep nothing else than death, how shall all either sleep or rise again if so many persons whom Christ shall find in the body shall neither sleep nor rise again? If, then, we believe that the saints who shall be found alive at Christ's coming, and shall be caught up to meet Him, shall in that same ascent pass from mortal to immortal bodies, we shall find no difficulty in the words of the apostle, either when he says, \"That which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die,\" or when he says, \"We Shall all rise,\" or \"all sleep,\" for not even the saints shall be quickened to immortality unless they first die, however briefly; and consequently they shall not be exempt from resurrection which is preceded by sleep, however brief. And why should it seem to us incredible that that multitude of bodies should be, as it were, sown in the air, and should in the air forthwith revive immortal and incorruptible, when we believe, on the testimony of the same apostle, that the resurrection shall take place in the twinkling of an eye, and that the dust of bodies long dead shall return with incomprehensible facility and swiftness to those members that are now to live endlessly? Neither do we suppose that in the case of these saints the sentence, \"Earth thou art, and unto earth shalt thou return,\" is null, though their bodies do not, on dying, fall to earth, but both die and rise again at once while caught up into the air. For \"Thou shalt return to earth\" means, Thou shalt at death return to that which thou weft before life began. Thou shalt, when examinate, be that which thou weft before thou wast animate. For it was into a face of earth that God breathed the breath of life when man was made a living soul; as if it were said, Thou art earth with a soul, which thou wast not; thou shalt be earth without a soul, as thou wast. And this is what all bodies of the dead are before they rot; and what the bodies of those saints shall be if they die, no matter where they die, as soon as they shall give up that life which they are immediately to receive back again. In this way, then, they return or go to earth, inasmuch as from being living men they shall be earth, as that which becomes cinder is said to go to cinder; that which decays, to go to decay; and so of six hundred other things. But the manner in which this shall take place we can now only feebly conjecture, and shall understand it only when it comes to pass. For that there shall be a bodily resurrection of the dead when Christ comes to judge quick and dead, we must believe if we would be Christians. But if we are unable perfectly to comprehend the manner in which it shall take place, our faith is not on this account vain. Now, however, we ought, as we formerly promised, to show, as far as seems necessary, what the ancient prophetic books predicted concerning this final judgment of God; and I fancy no great time need be spent in discussing and explaining these predictions, if the reader has been careful to avail himself of the help we have already furnished.","index":"92","references":[{"fn":"39","code":"P3948_2168846","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"1 Cor. xv. 51.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":15,"verses":[51]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 21.-Utterances of the Prophet Isaiah Regarding the Resurrection of the Dead and the Retributive Judgment.","index":23,"paragraphs":[{"text":"The prophet Isaiah says, \"The dead shall rise again, and all who were in the graves shall rise again; and all who are in the earth shall rejoice: for the dew which is from Thee is their health, and the earth of the wicked shall fall.\"[fn-39-P3952_2172374:101-nf] All the former part of this passage relates to the resurrection of the blessed; but the words, \"the earth of the wicked shall fall,\" is rightly understood as meaning that the bodies of the wicked shall fall into the ruin of damnation. And if we would more exactly and carefully scrutinize the words which refer to the resurrection of the good, we may refer to the first resurrection the words, \"the dead shall rise again,\" and to the second the following words, \"and all who were in the graves shall rise again.\" And if we ask what relates to those saints whom the Lord at His coming shall find alive upon earth, the following clause may suitably be referred to them; \"All who are in the earth shall rejoice: for the dew which is from Thee is their health.\" By \"health\" in this place it is best to understand immortality. For that is the most perfect health which is not repaired by nourishment as by a daily remedy. In like manner the same prophet, affording hope to the good and terrifying the wicked regarding the day of judgment, says, \"Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will flow down upon them as a river of peace, and upon the glory of the Gentiles as a rushing torrent; their sons shall be carried on the shoulders, and shall be comforted on the knees. As one whom his mother comforteth, so shall I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem. And ye shall see, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall rise up like a herb; and the hand of the Lord shall be known by His worshippers, and He shall threaten the contumacious. For, behold, the Lord shall come as a fire, and as a whirlwind His chariots, to execute vengeance with indignation, and wasting with a flame of fire. For with fire of the Lord shall all the earth be judged, and all flesh with His sword: many shall be wounded by the Lord.\"[fn-39-P3953_2174216:102-nf] In His promise to the good he says that He will flow down as a river of peace, that is to say, in the greatest possible abundance of peace. With this peace we shall in the end be refreshed; but of this we have spoken abundantly in the preceding book. It is this river in which he says He shall flow down upon those to whom He promises so great happiness, that we may understand that in the region of that felicity, which is in heaven, all things are satisfied from this river. But because there shall thence flow, even upon earthly bodies, the peace of incorruption and immortality, therefore he says that He shall flow down as this river, that He may as it were pour Himself from things above to things beneath, and make men the equals of the angels.

For it will not take place when we have seen; but we shall see when it has taken place. For he had already spoken of the new heavens and the new earth, speaking repeatedly, and under many figures, of the things promised to the saints, and saying,\"There shall be new heavens, and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind; but they shall find in it gladness and exultation. Behold, I will make Jerusalem an exultation, and my people a joy. And I will exult in Jerusalem, and joy in my people; and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her;\"[fn-39-P3957_2176778:105-nf] and other promises, which some endeavor to refer to carnal enjoyment during the thousand years. For, in the manner of prophecy, figurative and literal expressions are mingled, so that a serious mind may, by useful and salutary effort, reach the spiritual sense; but carnal sluggishness, or the slowness of an uneducated and undisciplined mind, rests in the superficial letter, and thinks there is nothing beneath to be looked for. But let this be enough regarding the style of those prophetic expressions just quoted. And now, to return to their interpretation. When he had said, \"And your bones shall rise up like a herb,\" in order to show that it was the resurrection of the good, though a bodily resurrection, to which he alluded, he added, \"And the hand of the Lord shall be known by His worshippers.\" What is this but the hand of Him who distinguishes those who worship from those who despise Him? Regarding these the context immediately adds, \"And He shall threaten the contumacious,\" or, as another translator has it, \"the unbelieving.\" He shall not actually threaten then, but the threats which are now uttered shall then be fulfilled in effect. \"For behold,\" he says, \"the Lord shall come as a fire, and as a whirlwind His chariots, to execute vengeance with indignation, and wasting with a flame of fire. For with fire of the Lord shall all the earth be judged, and all flesh with His sword: many shall be wounded by the Lord.\" By fire, whirlwind, sword, he means the judicial punishment of God. For he says that the Lord Himself shall come as a fire, to those, that is to say, to whom His coming shall be penal. By His chariots (for the word is plural)we suitably understand the ministration of angels. And when he says that all flesh and all the earth shall be judged with His fire and sword, we do not understand the spiritual and holy to be included, but the earthly and carnal, of whom it is said that they \"mind earthly things,\"[fn-39-P3958_2178747:106-nf] and \"to be carnally minded is death,\"[fn-39-P3959_2178807:107-nf] and whom the Lord calls simply flesh when He says, \"My Spirit shall not always remain in these men, for they are flesh.\"[fn-39-P3960_2178949:108-nf] As to the words, \"Many shall be wounded by the Lord,\" this wounding shall produce the second death. It is possible, indeed, to understand fire, sword, and wound in a good sense. For the Lord said that He wished to send fire on the earth.[fn-39-P3961_2179206:109-nf] And the cloven tongues appeared to them as fire when the Holy Spirit came.[fn-39-P3962_2179302:110-nf] And our Lord says, \"I am not come to send peace on earth, but a sword.\"[fn-39-P3963_2179393:111-nf] And Scripture says that the word of God is a doubly sharp sword,[fn-39-P3964_2179478:112-nf] on account of the two edges, the two Testaments. And in the Song of Songs the holy Church says that she is wounded with love,[fn-39-P3965_2179624:113-nf] -pierced, as it were, with the arrow of love. But here, where we read or hear that the Lord shall come to execute vengeance, it is obvious in what sense we are to understand these expressions.","index":"95","references":[{"fn":"39","code":"P3957_2176778","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Isa. lxv. 17-19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":65,"verses":[17]}]},{"fn":"39","code":"P3958_2178747","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Phil. iii. 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"philippians","chapter":3,"verses":[19]}]},{"fn":"39","code":"P3959_2178807","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Rom. viii. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":8,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"39","code":"P3960_2178949","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Gen. vi. 3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":6,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"39","code":"P3961_2179206","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Luke xii. 49.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":12,"verses":[49]}]},{"fn":"39","code":"P3962_2179302","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Acts ii. 3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"the acts","chapter":2,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"39","code":"P3963_2179393","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Matt. x. 34.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":10,"verses":[34]}]},{"fn":"39","code":"P3964_2179478","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Heb. iv. 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"hebrews","chapter":4,"verses":[12]}]},{"fn":"39","code":"P3965_2179624","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Song of Sol. ii. 5.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"After briefly mentioning those who shall be consumed in this judgment, speaking of the wicked and sinners under the figure of the meats forbidden by the old law, from which they had not abstained, he summarily recounts the grace of the new testament, from the first coming of the Saviour to the last judgment, of which we now speak; and herewith he concludes his prophecy.

For where divine aid is given, men believe, and where they believe, they come. And the Lord compared them, in a figure, to the children of Israel offering sacrifice to Him in His house with psalms, which is already everywhere done by the Church; and He promised that from among them He would choose for Himself priests and Levites, which also we see already accomplished. For we see that priests and Levites are now chosen, not from a certain family and blood, as was originally the rule in the priesthood according to the order of Aaron, but as befits the new testament, under which Christ is the High Priest after the order of Melchisedec, in consideration of the merit which is bestowed upon each man by divine grace.

Some, indeed, have translated \"carcass\"[fn-39-P3971_2183028:117-nf] instead of \"members of the men,\" meaning by carcases the manifest punishment of the body, although carcase is commonly used only of dead flesh, while the bodies here spoken of shall be animated, else they could not be sensible of any pain; but perhaps they may, without absurdity, be called carcases, as being the bodies of those who are to fall into the second death.

But that which is especially pertinent to our subject is this, that since the words \"All flesh shall come,\" apply to the good, for the people of God shall be composed of every race of men,-for all men shall not be present, since the greater part shall be in punishment,-but, as I was saying, since flesh is used of the good, and members or carcases of the bad, certainly it is thus put beyond a doubt that that judgment in which the good and the bad shall be allotted to their destinies shall take place after the resurrection of the body, our faith in which is thoroughly established by the use of these words.","index":"97","references":[{"fn":"39","code":"P3970_2182871","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Isa. lxvi. 22-24.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":66,"verses":[22]}]},{"fn":"39","code":"P3971_2183028","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"As the Vulgate: cadavera virorum.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"39","code":"P3972_2183560","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Here Augustin inserts the remark, \"Who does not see that cadavera (carcases) are so called from cadendo (falling)?\"","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 22.-What is Meant by the Good Going Out to See the Punishment of the Wicked.","index":24,"paragraphs":[{"text":"But in what way shall the good go out to see the punishment of the wicked?

But he who reads this passage, even half asleep, cannot fail to see that the kingdom of Antichrist shall fiercely, though for a short time, assail the Church before the last judgment of God shall introduce the eternal reign of the saints. For it is patent from the context that the time, times, and half a time, means a year, and two years, and half a year, that is to say, three years and a half. Sometimes in Scripture the same thing is indicated by months. For though the word times seems to be used here in the Latin indefinitely, that is only because the Latins have no dual, as the Greeks have, and as the Hebrews also are said to have. Times, therefore, is used for two times. As for theten kings, whom, as it seems, Antichrist is to find in the person of ten individuals when he comes, I own I am afraid we may be deceived in this, and that he may come unexpectedly while there are not ten kings living in the Roman world.

For here we find it said in the sacred books of the Hebrews, to that God whom this great philosopher acknowledges to be terrible even to the gods themselves, \"The heavens are the work of Thy hands; they shall perish.\" When the heavens, the higher and more secure part of the world, perish, shall the world itself be preserved? If this idea is not relished by Jupiter, whose oracle is quoted by this philosopher as an unquestionable authority in rebuke of the credulity of the Christians, why does he not similarly rebuke the wisdom of the Hebrews as folly, seeing that the prediction is found in their most holy books? But if this Hebrew wisdom, with which Porphyry is so captivated that he extols it through the utterances of his own gods, proclaims that the heavens are to perish, how is he so infatuated as to detest the faith of the Christians partly, if not chiefly, on this account, that they believe the world is to perish?-though how the heavens are to perish if the world does not is not easy to see.

But since, as I said, they will not condescend to reason thus, lest they should seem to approve of Peter's meaning, or ascribe as much importance to the final conflagration as we ascribe to the deluge, whereas they contend that no waters or flames could destroy the whole human race, it only remains to them to maintain that their gods lauded the wisdom of the Hebrews because they had not read this psalm.","index":"106","references":[]},{"text":" It is the last judgment of God which is referred to also in the 50th Psalm in the words, \"God shall come manifestly, our God, and shall not keep silence: fire shall devour before Him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about Him.

He, I say, shall come manifestly, and shall not keep silence, that is, shall make Himself known by His voice of judgment, who before, when he came hiddenly, was silent before His judge when He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and, as a lamb before the shearer, opened not His mouth as we read that it was prophesied of Him by Isaiah,[fn-40-P4004_2197409:137-nf] and as we see it fulfilled in the Gospel.[fn-40-P4005_2197472:138-nf] As for the fire and tempest, we have already said how these are to be interpreted when we were explaining a similar passage in Isaiah.[fn-40-P4006_2197630:139-nf] As to the expression, \"He shall call the heaven above,\" as the saints and the righteous are rightly called heaven, no doubt this means what the apostle says, \"We shallbe caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air.\"[fn-40-P4007_2197889:140-nf] For if we take the bare literal sense, how is it possible to call the heaven above, as if the heaven could be anywhere else than above? And the following expression, \"And the earth to judge His people,\" if we supply only the words, \"He shall call,\" that is to say, \"He shall call the earth also,\" and do not supply \"above,\" seems to give us a meaning in accordance with sonnet doctrine, the heaven symbolizing those who will judge along with Christ, and the earth those who shall be judged; and thus the words, \"He shall call the heaven above,\" would not mean, \"He shall catch up into the air,\" but \"He shall lift up to seats of judgment.\" Possibly, too, \"He shall call the heaven,\" may mean, He shall call the angels in the high and lofty places, that He may descend with them to do judgment; and \"He shall call the earth also\" would then mean, He shall call the men on the earth to judgment. But if with the words \"and the earth\" we understand not only \"He shall call,\" but also \"above,\" so as to make the full sense be, He shall call the heaven above, and He shall call the earth above, then I think it is best understood of the men who shall be caught up to meet Christ in the air, and that they are called the heaven with reference to their souls, and the earth with reference to their bodies. Then what is \"to judge His people,\" but to separate by judgment the good from the bad, as the sheep from the goats? Then he turns to address the angels: \"Gather His saints together unto Him.\" For certainly a matter so important must be accomplished by the ministry of angels. And if we ask who the saints are who are gathered unto Him by the angels, we are told, \"They who make a covenant with Him over sacrifices.\" This is the whole life of the saints, to make a covenant with God over sacrifices. For \"over sacrifices\" either refers to works of mercy, which are preferable to sacrifices in the judgment of God, who says, \"I desire mercy more than sacrifices,\"[fn-40-P4008_2199874:141-nf] or if \"over sacrifices\" means in sacrifices, then these very works of mercy are the sacrifices with which God is pleased, as I remember to have stated in the tenth book of this work;[fn-40-P4009_2200076:142-nf] and in these works the saints make a covenant with God, because they do them for the sake of the promises which are contained in His new testament or covenant. And hence, when His saints have been gathered to Him and set at His right hand in the last judgment, Christ shall say, \"Come, ye blessed of my Father, take possession of the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat,\"[fn-40-P4010_2200525:143-nf] and so on, mentioning the good works of the good, and their eternal rewards assigned by the last sentence of the Judge.","index":"107","references":[{"fn":"40","code":"P4003_2196813","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Ps. l. 3-5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":50,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4004_2197409","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Isa. 1iii. 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":3,"verses":[7]}]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4005_2197472","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Matt. xxvi. 63.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":26,"verses":[63]}]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4006_2197630","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Ch. 21.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4007_2197889","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"1 Thess. iv. 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 thessalonians","chapter":4,"verses":[17]}]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4008_2199874","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Hos. vi. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"hosea","chapter":6,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4009_2200076","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Ch. 6.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4010_2200525","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Matt. xxv. 34.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":25,"verses":[34]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 25.-Of Malachi's Prophecy, in Which He Speaks of the Last Judgment, and of a Cleansing Which Some are to Undergo by Purifying Punishments.","index":27,"paragraphs":[{"text":"The prophet Malachi or Malachias, who is also called Angel, and is by some (for Jerome[fn-40-P4014_2200899:144-nf] tells us that this is the opinion of the Hebrews) identified with Ezra the priest,[fn-40-P4015_2201011:145-nf] others of whose writings have been received into the canon, predicts the last judgment, saying, \"Behold, He cometh, saith the Lord Almighty; and who shall abide the day of His entrance? . . . for I am the Lord your God, and I change not.\"[fn-40-P4016_2201281:146-nf] From these words it more evidently appears that some shall in the last judgment suffer some kind of purgatorial punishments; for what else can be understood by the word, \"Who shall abide the day of His entrance, or who shall be able to look upon Him? for He enters as a moulder's fire, and as the herb of fullers: and He shall sit fusing and purifying as if over gold and silver: and He shall purify the sons of Levi, and pour them out like gold and silver?\" Similarly Isaiah says, \"The Lord shall wash the filthiness of the sons and daughters of Zion, and shall cleanse away the blood from their midst, by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning.\"[fn-40-P4017_2201987:147-nf] Unless perhaps we should say that they are cleansed from filthiness and in a manner clarified, when the wicked are separated from them by penal judgment, so that the elimination and damnation of the one party is the purgation of the others, because they shall henceforth live free from the contamination of such men. But when he says, \"And he shall purify the sons of Levi, and pour them out like gold and silver, and they shall offer to the Lord sacrifices in righteousness; and the sacrifices of Judah and Jerusalem shall be pleasing to the Lord,\" he declares that those who shall be purified shall then please the Lord with sacrifices of righteousness, and consequently they themselves shall be purified from their own unrighteousness which made them displeasing to God. Now they themselves, when they have been purified, shall be sacrifices of complete and perfect righteousness; for what more acceptable offering can such persons make to God than themselves? But this question of purgatorial punishments we must defer to another time, to give it a more adequate treatment. By the sons of Levi and Judah and Jerusalem we ought to understand the Church herself, gathered not from the Hebrews only, but from other nations as well; nor such a Church as she now is, when \"if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us,\"[fn-40-P4018_2203360:148-nf] but as she shall then be, purged by the last judgment as a threshing-floor by a winnowing wind, and those of her members who need it being cleansed by fire, so that there remains absolutely not one who offers sacrifice for his sins.

And hence we see how vainly the Jews promise themselves a return of the old times of sacrificing according to the law of the old testament, grounding on the words which follow, \"And the sacrifice of Judah and Jerusalem shall be pleasing to the Lord, as in the primitive days, and as in former years.\" For in the times of the law they offered sacrifices not in righteousness but in sins, offering especially and primarily for sins, so much so that even the priest himself, whom we must suppose to have been their most righteous man, was accustomed to offer, according to God's commandments, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. And therefore we must explain how we are to understand the words, \"as in the primitive days, and as in former years;\" for perhaps he alludes to the time in which our first parents were in paradise. Then, indeed, intact and pure from all stain and blemish of sin, they offered themselves to God as the purest sacrifices. But since they were banished thence on account of their transgression, and human nature was condemned in them, with the exception of the one Mediator and those who have been baptized, and are as yet infants, \"there is none clean from stain, not even the babe whose life has been but for a day upon the earth.\"[fn-40-P4022_2205430:149-nf] But if it be replied that those who offer in faith may be said to offer in righteousness, because the righteous lives by faith,[fn-40-P4023_2205578:150-nf] -he deceives himself, however, if he says that he has no sin, and therefore he does not say so, because he lives by faith,-will any man say this time of faith can be placed on an equal footing with that consummation when they who offer sacrifices in righteousness shall be purified by the fire of the last judgment? And consequently, since it must be believed that after such a cleansing the righteous shall retain no sin, assuredly that time, so far as regards its freedom from sin, can be compared to no other period, unless to that during which our first parents lived in paradise in the most innocent happiness before their transgression. It is this period, then, which is properly understood when it is said, \"as in the primitive days, and as in former years.\" For in Isaiah, too, after the new heavens and the new earth have been promised, among other elements in the blessedness of the saints which are there depicted by allegories and figures, from giving an adequate explanation of which I am prevented by a desire to avoid prolixity, it is said, \"According to the days of the tree of life shall be the days of my people.\"[fn-40-P4024_2206730:151-nf] And who that has looked at Scripture does not know where God planted the tree of life, from whose fruit He excluded our first parents when their own iniquity ejected them from paradise, and round which a terrible and fiery fence was set?","index":"111","references":[{"fn":"40","code":"P4022_2205430","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Job. xiv. 4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"job","chapter":14,"verses":[4]}]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4023_2205578","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Rom. i. 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":1,"verses":[17]}]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4024_2206730","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Isa. lxv. 22.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":65,"verses":[22]}]}]},{"text":"But if any one contends that those days of the tree of life mentioned by the prophet Isaiah are the present times of the Church of Christ, and that Christ Himself is prophetically called the Tree of Life, because He is Wisdom, and of wisdom Solomon says, \"It is a tree of life to all who embrace it;\"[fn-40-P4026_2207289:152-nf] and if they maintain that our first parents did not pass years in paradise, but were driven from it so soon that none of their children were begotten there, and that therefore that time cannot be alluded to in words which run, \"as in the primitive days, and as in former years,\" I forbear entering on this question, lest by discussing everything I become prolix, and leave the whole subject in uncertainty.

For not without reason do we hope that before the coming of our Judge and Saviour Elias shall come, because we have good reason to believe that he is now alive; for, as Scripture most distinctly informs us,[fn-40-P4047_2214288:163-nf] he was taken up from this life in a chariot of fire. When, therefore, he is come, he shall give a spiritual explanation of the law which the Jews at present understand carnally, and shall thus \"turn the heart of the father to the son,\" that is, the heart of fathers to their children; for the Septuagint translators have frequently put the singular for the plural number. And the meaning is, that the sons, that is, the Jews, shall understand the law as the fathers, that is, the prophets, and among them Moses himself, understood it. For the heart of the fathers shall be turned to their children when the children understand the law as their fathers did; and the heart of the children shall be turned to their fathers when they have the same sentiments as the fathers. The Septuagint used the expression, \"and the heart of a man to his next of kin,\" because fathers and children are eminently neighbors to one another. Another and a preferable sense can be found in the words of the Septuagint translators, who have translated Scripture with an eye to prophecy, the sense, viz., that Elias shall turn the heart of God the Father to the Son, not certainly as if he should bring about this love of the Father for the Son, but meaning that he should make it known, and that the Jews also, who had previously hated, should then love the Son who is our Christ. For so far as regards the Jews, God has His heart turned away from our Christ, this being their conception about God and Christ. But in their case the heart of God shall be turned to the Son when they themselves shall turn in heart, and learn the love of the Father towards the Son. The words following, \"and the heart of a man to his next of kin,\"-that is, Elias shall also turn the heart of a man to his next of kin,-how can we understand this better than as the heart of a man to the man Christ? For though in the form of God He is our God, yet, taking the form of a servant, He condescended to become also our next of kin. It is this, then, which Elias will do, \"lest,\" he says, \"I come and smite the earth utterly.\" For they who mind earthly things are the earth. Such are the carnal Jews until this day; and hence these murmurs of theirs against God, \"The wicked are pleasing to Him,\" and \"It is a vain thing to serve God.\"[fn-40-P4048_2216599:164-nf] ","index":"119","references":[{"fn":"40","code":"P4046_2213797","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Mal. iv. 5, 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"malachi","chapter":4,"verses":[5]}]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4047_2214288","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"2 Kings ii. 11.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 kings","chapter":2,"verses":[11]}]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4048_2216599","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Mal. ii. 17; iii. 14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"malachi","chapter":2,"verses":[17]},{"book":"malachi","chapter":2,"verses":[17]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter 30.-That in the Books of the Old Testament, Where It is Said that God Shall Judge the World, the Person of Christ is Not Explicitly Indicated, But It Plainly Appears from Some Passages in Which the Lord God Speaks that Christ is Meant.","index":32,"paragraphs":[{"text":"There are many other passages of Scripture bearing on the last judgment of God,-so many, indeed, that to cite them all would swell this book to an unpardonable size. Suffice it to have proved that both Old and New Testament enounce the judgment. But in the Old it is not so definitely declared as in the New that the judgment shall be administered by Christ, that is, that Christ shall descend from heaven as the Judge; for when it is therein stated by the Lord God or His prophet that the Lord God shall come, we do not necessarily understand this of Christ.

And therefore we must first show how Jesus Christ speaks in the prophetical books under the title of the Lord God, while yet there can be no doubt that it is Jesus Christ who speaks; so that in other passages where this is not at once apparent, and where nevertheless it is said that the Lord God will come to that last judgment, we may understand that Jesus Christ is meant. There is a passage in the prophet Isaiah which illustrates what I mean. For God says by the prophet, \"Hear me, Jacob and Israel, whom I call. I am the first, and I am for ever: and my hand has rounded the earth, and my right hand has established the heaven. I will call them, and they shall stand together, and be gathered, and hear.

For this had been promised to the apostles when the Lord said, \"I will make you fishers of men.\"[fn-40-P4059_2220883:171-nf] And to one of them He says, \"From henceforth thou shalt catch men.\"[fn-40-P4060_2220972:172-nf] They were then to become a spoil, but in a good sense, as those who are snatched from that strong one when he is bound by a stronger.[fn-40-P4061_2221125:173-nf] ","index":"122","references":[{"fn":"40","code":"P4055_2219689","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Zech. ii. 8, 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"zechariah","chapter":2,"verses":[8]}]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4056_2219994","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Matt. xv. 24.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":15,"verses":[24]}]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4057_2220288","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"John vii. 39.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":7,"verses":[39]}]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4058_2220526","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Ps. xviii. 43.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":18,"verses":[43]}]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4059_2220883","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Matt. iv. 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":4,"verses":[19]}]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4060_2220972","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Luke v. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":5,"verses":[10]}]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4061_2221125","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Matt. xii. 29.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":12,"verses":[29]}]}]},{"text":"In like manner the Lord, speaking by the same prophet, says, \"And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and mercy; and they shall look upon me because they have insulted me, and they shall mourn for Him as for one very dear, and shall be in bitterness as for an only-begotten.\"[fn-40-P4063_2221595:174-nf] To whom but to God does it belong to destroy all the nations that are hostile to the holy city Jerusalem, which \"come against it,\" that is, are opposed to it, or, as some translate, \"come upon it,\" as if putting it down under them; or to pour out upon the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and mercy? This belongs doubtless to God, and it is to God the prophet ascribes the words; and yet Christ shows that He is the God who does these so great and divine things, when He goes on to say, \"And they shall look upon me because they have insulted me, and they shall mourn for Him as if for one very dear (or beloved), and shall be in bitterness for Him as for an only-begotten.\" For in that day the Jews-those of them, at least, who shall receive the spirit of grace and mercy-when they see Him coming in His majesty, and recognize that it is He whom they, in the person of their parents, insulted when He came before in His humiliation, shall repent of insulting Him in His passion: and their parents themselves, who were the perpetrators of this huge impiety, shall see Him when they rise; but this will be only for their punishment, and not for their correction. It is not of them we are to understand the words, \"And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and mercy, and they shall look upon me because they have insulted me;\" but we are to understand the words of their descendants, who shall at that time believe through Elias. But as we say to the Jews, You killed Christ, although it was their parents who did so, so these persons shall grieve that they in some sort did what their progenitors did. Although, therefore, those that receive the spirit of mercy and grace, and believe, shall not be condemned with their impious parents, yet they shall mourn as if they themselves had done what their parents did. Their grief shall arise not so much from guilt as from pious affection. Certainly the words which the Septuagint have translated, \"They shall look upon me because they insulted me,\" stand in the Hebrew,\"They shall look upon me whom they pierced.\"[fn-40-P4064_2223774:175-nf] And by this word the crucifixion of Christ is certainly more plainly indicated. But the Septuagint translators preferred to allude to the insult which was involved in His whole passion. For in point of fact they insuited Him both when He was arrested and when He was bound, when He was judged, when He was mocked by the robe they put on Him and the homage they did on bended knee, when He was crowned with thorns and struck with a rod on the head, when He bore His cross, and when at last He hung upon the tree. And therefore we recognize more fully the Lord's passion when we do not confine ourselves to one interpretation, but combine both, and read both \"insulted\" and \"pierced.\"","index":"123","references":[{"fn":"40","code":"P4063_2221595","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Zech. xii. 9, 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"zechariah","chapter":12,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4064_2223774","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"So the Vulgate.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"When, therefore, we read in the prophetical books that God is to come to do judgment at the last, from the mere mention of the judgment, and although there is nothing else to determine the meaning, we must gather that Christ is meant; for though the Father will judge, He will judge by the coming of the Son. For He Himself, by His own manifested presence, \"judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son;\"[fn-40-P4066_2224896:176-nf] for as the Son was judged as a man, He shall also judge in human form. For it is none but He of whom God speaks by Isaiah under the name of Jacob and Israel, of whose seed Christ took a body, as it is written, \"Jacob is my servant, I will uphold Him; Israel is mine elect, my Spirit has assumed Him: I have put my Spirit upon Him; He shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not cry, nor cease, neither shall His voice be heard without. A bruised reed shall He not break, and the smoking flax shall He not quench: but in truth shall He bring forth judgment. He shall shine and shall not be broken, until He sets judgment in the earth: and the nations shall hope in His name.\"[fn-40-P4067_2225603:177-nf] The Hebrew has not \"Jacob\" and \"Israel;\" but the Septuagint translators, wishing to show the significance of the expression \"my servant,\" and that it refers to the form of a servant in which the Most High humbled Himself, inserted the name of that man from whose stock He took the form of a servant. The Holy Spirit was given to Him, and was manifested, as the evangelist testifies, in the form of a dove.[fn-40-P4068_2226033:178-nf] He brought forth judgment to the Gentiles, because He predicted what was hidden from them. In His meekness He did not cry, nor did He cease to proclaim the truth. But His voice was not heard, nor is it heard, without, because He is not obeyed by those who are outside of His body. And the Jews themselves, who persecuted Him, He did not break, though as a bruised reed they had lost their integrity, and as smoking flax their light was quenched; for He spared them, having come to be judged and not yet to judge. He brought forth judgment in truth, declaring that they should be punished did they persist in their wickedness. His face shone on the Mount,[fn-40-P4069_2226707:179-nf] His fame in the world. He is not broken nor over come, because neither in Himself nor in His Church has persecution prevailed to annihilate Him. And therefore that has not, and shall not, be brought about which His enemies said or say, \"When shall He die, and His name perish?\"[fn-40-P4070_2227011:180-nf] \"until He set judgment in the earth.\" Behold, the hidden thing which we were seeking is discovered. For this is the last judgment, which He will set in the earth when He comes from heaven. And it is in Him, too, we already see the concluding expression of the prophecy fulfilled: \"In His name shall the nations hope.\" And by this fulfillment, which no one can deny, men are encouraged to believe in that which is most impudently denied. For who could have hoped for that which even those who do not yet believe in Christ now see fulfilled among us, and which is so undeniable that they can but gnash their teeth and pine away? Who, I say, could have hoped that the nations would hope in the name of Christ, when He was arrested, bound, scourged, mocked, crucified, when even the disciples themselves had lost the hope which they had begun to have in Him? The hope which was then entertained scarcely by the one thief on the cross, is now cherished by nations everywhere on the earth, who are marked with the sign of the cross on which He died that they may not die eternally.","index":"124","references":[{"fn":"40","code":"P4066_2224896","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"John v. 22.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":5,"verses":[22]}]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4067_2225603","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Isa. xlii. 1-4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":42,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4068_2226033","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"John i. 32.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":1,"verses":[32]}]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4069_2226707","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Matt. xvii. 1, 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":17,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4070_2227011","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Ps. xli. 5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":41,"verses":[5]}]}]},{"text":"That the last judgment, then, shall be administered by Jesus Christ in the manner predicted in the sacred writings is denied or doubted by no one, unless by those who, through some incredible animosity or blindness, decline to believe these writings, though already their truth is demonstrated to all the world.
