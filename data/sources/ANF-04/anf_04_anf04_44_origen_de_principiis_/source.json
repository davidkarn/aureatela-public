All who believe and are assured that grace and truth were obtained through Jesus Christ, and who know Christ to be the truth, agreeably to His own declaration, \"I am the truth,\"[fn-62-P6209_1086036:1-nf] derive the knowledge which incites men to a good and happy life from no other source than from the very words and teaching of Christ. And by the words of Christ we do not mean those only which He spake when He became man and tabernacled in the flesh; for before that time, Christ, the Word of God, was in Moses and the prophets. For without the Word of God, how could they have been able to prophesy of Christ? And were it not our purpose to confine the present treatise within the limits of all attainable brevity, it would not be difficult to show, in proof of this statement, out of the Holy Scriptures, how Moses or the prophets both spake and performed all they did through being filled with the Spirit of Christ. And therefore I think it sufficient to quote this one testimony of Paul from the Epistle to the Hebrews,[fn-62-P6210_1086876:2-nf] in which he says: \"By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of the Egyptians.\"[fn-62-P6211_1087857:3-nf] Moreover, that after His ascension into heaven He spake in His apostles, is shown by Paul in these words: \"Or do you seek a proof of Christ who speaketh in me? \"[fn-62-P6212_1088038:4-nf] ","index":"4","references":[{"fn":"62","code":"P6209_1086036","folder":"ANF-04","text":"John xiv. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":14,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"62","code":"P6210_1086876","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Here, and frequently elsewhere (some two hundred times in all), Origen, in his extant works, ascribes the authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews to St. Paul.

Since many, however, of those who profess to believe in Christ differ from each other, not only in small and trifling matters, but also on subjects of the highest importance, as, e.g., regarding God, or the Lord Jesus Christ, or the Holy Spirit; and not only regarding these, but also regarding others which are created existences, viz., the powers[fn-62-P6214_1088409:5-nf] and the holy virtues;[fn-62-P6215_1088448:6-nf] it seems on that account necessary first of all to fix a definite limit and to lay down an unmistakable rule regarding each one of these, and then to pass to the investigation of other points. For as we ceased to seek for truth (notwithstanding the professions of many among Greeks and Barbarians to make it known) among all who claimed it for erroneous opinions, after we had come to believe that Christ was the Son of God, and were persuaded that we must learn it from Himself; so, seeing there are many who think they hold the opinions of Christ, and yet some of these think differently from their predecessors, yet as the teaching of the Church, transmitted in orderly succession from the apostles, and remaining in the Churches to the present day, is still preserved, that alone is to be accepted as truth which differs in no respect from ecclesiastical and apostolical tradition.","index":"5","references":[{"fn":"62","code":"P6214_1088409","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Dominationes.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"62","code":"P6215_1088448","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Virtutes.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"3.

After these points, also, the apostolic teaching is that the soul, having a substance[fn-62-P6225_1093304:10-nf] and life of its own, shall, after its departure from the world, be rewarded according to its deserts, being destined to obtain either an inheritance of eternal life and blessedness, if its actions shall have procured this for it, or to be delivered up to eternal fire and punishments, if the guilt of its crimes shall have brought it down to this: and also, that there is to be a time of resurrection from the dead, when this body, which now \"is sown in corruption, shall rise in incorruption,\" and that which \"is sown in dishonour will rise in glory.\"[fn-62-P6226_1093874:11-nf] This also is clearly defined in the teaching of the Church, that every rational soul is possessed of free-will and volition; that it has a straggle to maintain with the devil and his angels, and opposing influences,[fn-62-P6227_1094114:12-nf] because they strive to burden it with sins; but if we live rightly and wisely, we should endeavour to shake ourselves free of a burden of that kind. From which it follows, also, that we understand ourselves not to be subject to necessity, so as to be compelled by all means, even against our will, to do either good or evil. For if we are our own masters, some influences perhaps may impel us to sin, and others help us to salvation; we are not forced, however, by any necessity either to act rightly or wrongly, which those persons think is the case who say that the courses and movements of the stars are the cause of human actions, not only of those which take place beyond the influence of the freedom of the will, but also of those which are placed within our own power. But with respect to the soul, whether it is derived from the seed by a process of traducianism, so that the reason or substance of it may be considered as placed in the seminal particles of the body themselves, or whether it has any other beginning; and this beginning, itself, whether it be by birth or not, or whether bestowed upon the body from without or no, is not distinguished with sufficient clearness in the teaching of the Church.","index":"11","references":[{"fn":"62","code":"P6225_1093304","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Substantia.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"62","code":"P6226_1093874","folder":"ANF-04","text":"1 Cor. xv. 42, 43.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":15,"verses":[42]}]},{"fn":"62","code":"P6227_1094114","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Virtutes.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"6.

But even if the point were to be conceded, the word a0sw/maton there does not convey the same meaning as is intended by Greek and Gentile authors when incorporeal nature is discussed by philosophers. For in the little treatise referred to he used the phrase \"incorporeal demon\" to denote that that form or outline of demoniacal body, whatever it is, does not resemble this gross and visible body of ours; but, agreeably to the intention of the author of the treatise, it must be understood to mean that He had not such a body as demons have, which is naturally fine,[fn-62-P6235_1098630:16-nf] and thin as if formed of air (and for this reason is either considered or called by many incorporeal), but that He had a solid and palpable body. Now, according to human custom, everything which is not of that nature is called by the simple or ignorant incorporeal; as if one were to say that the air which we breathe was incorporeal, because it is not a body of such a nature as can be grasped and held, or can offer resistance to pressure.","index":"15","references":[{"fn":"62","code":"P6233_1096982","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Eusebius (Hist.
