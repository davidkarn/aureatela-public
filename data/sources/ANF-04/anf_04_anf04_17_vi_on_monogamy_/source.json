The former marry not even once; the latter not only once. What dost thou, Law of the Creator? Between alien eunuchs and thine own grooms, thou complainest as much of the over-obedience of thine own household as of the contempt of strangers. They who abuse thee, do thee equal hurt with them who use thee not. In fact, neither is such continence laudable because it is heretical, nor such licence defensible because it is psychical. The former is blasphemous, the latter wanton; the former destroys the God of marriages, the latter puts Him to the blush. Among us, however, whom the recognition of spiritual gifts entitles to be deservedly called Spiritual, continence is as religious as licence is modest; since both the one and the other are in harmony with the Creator. Continence honours the law of marriage, licence tempers it; the former is not forced, the latter is regulated; the former recognises the power of free choice, the latter recognises a limit. We admit one marriage, just as we do one God. The law of marriage reaps an accession of honour where it is associated with shamefastness. But to the Psychics, since they receive not the Spirit, the things which are the Spirit's are not pleasing. Thus, so long as the things which are the Spirit's please them not, the things which are of the flesh will please, as being the contraries of the Spirit. \"The flesh,\" saith (the apostle), \"lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh.\"[fn-10-P1076_274090:2-nf] But what will the flesh \"lust\" after, except what is more of the flesh?

For the adversary spirit would be apparent from the diversity of his preaching, beginning by adulterating the rule of faith, and so (going on to) adulterating the order of discipline; because the corruption of that which holds the first grade, (that is, of faith, which is prior to discipline,) comes first. A man must of necessity hold heretical views of God first, and then of His institution.

And accordingly (he says), \"It remains, that both they who have wives so be as if they have not,\"[fn-10-P1092_278820:11-nf] that it may be the more binding on them who have not to abstain from having them.

Permission has its cause sometimes even in necessity. Finally, in this case, there is no volition on the part of him who permits marriage. For his volition points another way. \"I will,\" he says, \"that you all so be as I too (am).\"[fn-10-P1095_279638:14-nf] And when he shows that (so to abide) is \"better,\" what, pray, does he demonstrate himself to \"will,\" but what he has premised is \"better? \"And thus, if he permits something other than what he has \"willed\"-permitted not voluntarily, but of necessity-he shows that what he has unwillingly granted as an indulgence is not absolutely good. Finally, when he says, \"Better it is to marry than to burn,\" what sort of good must that be understood to be which is better than a penalty? which cannot seem \"better\" except when compared to a thing very bad? \"Good\" is that which keeps this name per se; without comparison-I say not with an evil, but even-with some other good: so that, even if it be compared to and overshadowed by another good, it nevertheless remains in (possession of) the name of good. If, on the other hand, comparison with evil is the mean which obliges it to be called good; it is not so much \"good\" as a species of inferior evil, which, when obscured by a higher evil, is driven to the name of good. Take away, in Short, the condition, so as not to say, \"Better it is to marry than to burn; \"and I question whether you will have the hardihood to say, \"Better (it is) to marry,\" not adding than what it is better. This done, then, it becomes not\" better; \"and while not \"better,\" not \"good\" either, the condition being taken away which, while making it \"better\" than another thing, in that sense obliges it to be considered \"good.\" Better it is to lose one eye than two.

This very thing is demonstrable by us: that the rule of monogamy is neither novel nor strange, nay rather, is both ancient, and proper to Christians; so that you may be sensible that the Paraclete is rather its restitutor than institutor. As for what pertains to antiquity, what more ancient formal type can be brought forward, than the very original fount of the human race? One female did God fashion for the male, culling one rib of his, and (of course) (one) out of a plurality. But, moreover, in the introductory speech which preceded the work itself, He said, \"It is not good for the man that he be alone; let us make an help-meet for him.\" For He would have said \"helpers\" if He had destined him to have more wives (than one). He added, too, a law concerning the future; if, that is, (the words) \"And two shall be (made) into one flesh\"-not three, nor more; else they would be no more \"two\" if (there were) more-were prophetically uttered. The law stood (firm). In short, the unity of marriage lasted to the very end in the case of the authors of our race; not because there were no other women, but because the reason why there were none was that the first-fruits of the race might not be contaminated by a double marriage. Otherwise, had God (so) willed, there could withal have been (others); at all events, he might have taken from the abundance of his own daughters-having no less an Eve (taken) out of his own bones and flesh-if piety had allowed it to be done. But where the first crime (is found)homicide, inaugurated in fratricide-no crime was so worthy of the second place as a double marriage. For it makes no difference whether a man have had two wives singly, or whether individuals (taken) at the same time have made two. The number of (the individuals) conjoined and separate is the same. Still, God's institution, after once for all suffering violence through Lamech, remained firm to the very end of that race. Second Lamech there arose none, in the way of being husband to two wives.

And since there are some who sometimes assert that they have nothing to do with the law (which Christ has not dissolved, but fulfilled),[fn-11-P1139_297094:41-nf] sometimes catch at such parts of the law as they choose; plainly do we too assert that the law has deceased in this sense, that its burdens-according to the sentence of the apostles-which not even the fathers were able to sustain,[fn-11-P1140_297347:42-nf] have wholly ceased: such (parts), however. as relate to righteousness not only permanently remain reserved, but even amplified; in order, to be sure, that our righteousness may be able to redound above the righteousness of the scribes and of the Pharisees.[fn-11-P1141_297627:43-nf] If \"righteousness\" must, of course chastity must too. If, then, forasmuch as there is in the law a precept that a man is to take in marriage the wife of his brother if he have died without children,[fn-11-P1142_297844:44-nf] for the purpose of raising up seed to his brother; and this may happen repeatedly to the same person, according to that crafty question of the Sadducees;[fn-11-P1143_298020:45-nf] men for that reason think that frequency of marriage is permitted in other cases as well: it will be their duty to understand first the reason of the precept itself; and thus they will come to know that that reason, now ceasing, is among those parts of the law which have been cancelled. Necessary it was that there should be a succession to the marriage of a brother if he died childless: first, because that ancient benediction, \"Grow and multiply,\"[fn-11-P1144_298553:46-nf] had still to run its course; secondly, because the sins of the fathers used to be exacted even from the sons;[fn-11-P1145_298707:47-nf] thirdly, because eunuchs and barren persons used to be regarded as ignominious. And thus, for fear that such as had died childless, not from natural inability, but from being prematurely overtaken by death, should be judged equally accursed (with the other class); for this reason a vicarious and (so to say) posthumous offspring used to be supplied them. But (now), when the \"extremity of the times\" has cancelled (the command) \"Grow and multiply,\" since the apostles (another command), \"It remaineth, that both they who have wives so be as if they have not,\" because \"the time is compressed;[fn-11-P1146_299388:48-nf] and \"the sour grape\" chewed by \"the fathers\" has ceased \"to set the sons' teeth on edge,\"[fn-11-P1147_299510:49-nf] for, \"each one shall die in his own sin; \"and \"eunuchs\" not only have lost ignominy, but have even deserved grace, being invited into \"the kingdoms of the heavens: \"[fn-11-P1148_299748:50-nf] the law of succeeding to the wife of a brother being buried, its contrary has obtained-that of not succeeding to the wife of a brother. And thus, as we have said before, what has ceased to be valid, on the cessation of its reason, cannot furnish a ground of argument to another. Therefore a wife, when her husband is dead, will not marry; for if she marry, she will of course be marrying (his) brother: for \"all we are brethren.\"[fn-11-P1149_300212:51-nf] Again, the woman, if intending to marry, has to marry \"in the Lord; \"[fn-11-P1150_300303:52-nf] that is, not to an heathen, but to a brother, inasmuch as even the ancient law forbids[fn-11-P1151_300411:53-nf] marriage with members of another tribe. Since, moreover, even in Leviticus there is a caution, \"Whoever shall have taken (his) brother's wife, (it) is uncleanness-turpitude; without children shall (he) die; \"[fn-11-P1152_300702:54-nf] beyond doubt, while the man is prohibited from marrying a second time, the woman is prohibited too, having no one to marry except a brother. In what way, then, an agreement shall be established between the apostle and the Law (which he is not impugning in its entirety), shall be shown when we shall have come to his own epistle. Meantime, so far as pertains to the law, the lines of argument drawn from it are more suitable for us (than for our opponents). In short, the same (law) prohibits priests from marrying a second time. The daughter also of a priest it bids, if widowed or repudiated, if she have had no seed, to return into her father's home and be nourished from his bread.[fn-11-P1153_301425:55-nf] The reason why (it is said), \"If she have had no seed,\" is not that if she have she may marry again-for how much more will she abstain from marrying if she have sons?-but that, if she have, she may be \"nourished\" by her son rather than by her father; in order that the son, too, may carry out the precept of God, \"Honour father and mother.\"[fn-11-P1154_301870:56-nf] Us, moreover, Jesus, the Father's Highest and Great Priest,[fn-11-P1155_301956:57-nf] clothing us from His own store[fn-11-P1156_302153:58-nf] -inasmuch as they \"who are baptized in Christ[fn-11-P1157_302352:59-nf] have put on Christ\"-has made \"priests to God His Father,\"[fn-11-P1158_302463:60-nf] according to John. For the reason why He recalls that young man who was hastening to his father's obsequies,[fn-11-P1159_302592:61-nf] is that He may show that we are called priests by Him; (priests) whom the Law used to forbid to be present at the sepulture of parents:[fn-11-P1160_302770:62-nf] \"Over every dead soul,\" it says, \"the priest shall not enter, and over his own father and over his own mother he shall not be contaminated.\" \"Does it follow that we too are bound to observe this prohibition? \"No, of course. For our one Father, God, lives, and our mother, the Church; and neither are we dead who live to God, nor do we bury our dead, inasmuch as they too are living in Christ.

Such is God's verdict, within straiter limits than men's, that universally, whether through marriage or promiscuously, the admission of a second man (to intercourse) is pronounced adultery by Him. For let us see what marriage is in the eye of God; and thus we shall learn what adultery equally is. Marriage is (this): when God joins \"two into one flesh; \"or else, finding (them already) joined in the same flesh, has given His seal to the conjunction. Adultery is (this): when, the two having been-in whatsoever way-disjoined, other-nay, rather alien-flesh is mingled (with either): flesh concerning which it cannot be affirmed, \"This is flesh out of my flesh, and this bone out of my bones.\"[fn-11-P1184_311022:79-nf] For this, once for all done and pronounced, as from the beginning, so now too, cannot apply to \"other\" flesh. Accordingly, it will be without cause that you will say that God wills not a divorced woman to be joined to another man \"while her husband liveth,\" as if He do will it \"when he is dead; \"[fn-11-P1185_311363:80-nf] whereas if she is not bound to him when dead, no more is she when living. \"Alike when divorce dissevers marriage as when death does, she will not be bound to him by whom the binding medium has been broken off.\" To whom, then, will she be bound? In the eye of God, it matters nought whether she marry during her life or after his death. For it is not against him that she sins, but against herself. \"Any sin which a man may have committed is external to the body; but ] (he) who commits adultery sins against his own body.\" But-as we have previously laid down above-whoever shall intermingle with himself \"other\" flesh, over and above that pristine flesh which God either conjoined into two or else found (already) conjoined, commits adultery. And the reason why He has abolished divorce, which \"was not from the beginning,\" is, thatHe may strengthen that which \"was from the beginning\"-the permanent conjunction, (namely), of \"two into one flesh: \"for fear that necessity or opportunity for a third union of flesh may make an irruption (into His dominion); permitting divorce to no cause but one-if, (that is), the (evil) against which precaution is taken chance to have occurred beforehand. So true, moreover, is it that divorce \"was not from the beginning,\" that among the Romans it is not till after the six hundredth year from the building of the city that this kind of \"hard-heartedness\"[fn-11-P1186_312782:81-nf] is set down as having been committed.

For let us reflect that divorce either is caused by discord, or else causes discord; whereas death is an event resulting from the law of God, not from an offence of man; and that it is a debt which all owe, even the unmarried. Therefore, if a divorced woman, who has been separated (from her husband)in soul as well as body, through discord, anger, hatred, and the causes of these-injury, or contumely, or whatsoever cause of complaint-is bound to a personal enemy, not to say a husband, how much more will one who, neither by her own nor her husband's fault, but by an event resulting from the Lord's law, has been-not separated from, but left behind by-her consort, be his, even when dead, to whom, even when dead, she owes (the debt of) concord? From him from whom she has heard no (word of) divorce she does not turn away; with him she is, to whom she has written no (document of) divorce; him whom she was unwilling to have lost, she retains. She has within her the licence of the mind, which represents to a man, in imaginary enjoyment, all things which he has not. In short, I ask the woman herself, \"Tell me, sister, have you sent your husband before you (to his rest) in peace? \"What will she answer? (Will she say), \"In discord? \"In that case she is the more bound to him with whom she has a cause (to plead) at the bar of God. She who is bound (to another) has not departed (from him). But (will she say), \"In peace? \"In that case, she must necessarily persevere in that (peace) with him whom she will no longer have the power to divorce; not that she would, even if she had been able to divorce him, have been marriageable. Indeed, she prays for his soul, and requests refreshment for him meanwhile, and fellowship (with him) in the first resurrection; and she offers (her sacrifice) on the anniversaries of his falling asleep. For, unless she does these deeds, she has in the true sense divorced him, so far as in her lies; and indeed the more iniquitously-inasmuch as (she did it) as far as was in her power-because she had no power (to do it); and with the more indignity, inasmuch as it is with more indignity if (her reason for doing it is) because he did not deserve it.

And they, plainly, will give husbands and wives as they would morsels of bread; for this is their rendering of \"To every one who asketh thee thou shalt give!\"[fn-11-P1198_318501:86-nf] And they will join you together in a virgin church, the one betrothed of the one Christ! And you will pray for your husbands, the new and the old. Make your election, to which of the twain you will play the adulteress. I think, to both. But if you have any wisdom, be silent on behalf of the dead one. Let your silence be to him a divorce, already endorsed in the dotal gifts of another. In this way you will earn the new husband's favour, if you forget the old. You ought to take more pains to please him for whose sake you have not preferred to please God! Such (conduct) the Psychics will have it the apostle approved, or else totally failed to think about, when he wrote: \"The woman is bound for such length of time as her husband liveth; but if he shall have died, she is free; whom she will let her marry, only in the Lord.\"[fn-11-P1199_319394:87-nf] For it is out of this passage that they draw their defence of the licence of second marriage; nay, even of (marriages) to any amount, if of second (marriage): for that which has ceased to be once for all, is open to any and every number. But the sense in which the apostle did write will be apparent, if first an agreement be come to that he did not write it in the sense of which the Psychics avail themselves. Such an agreement, moreover, will be come to if one first recall to mind those (passages) which are diverse from the passage in question, when tried by the standard of doctrine, of volition, and of Paul's own discipline. For, if he permits second nuptials, which were not \"from the beginning,\" how does he affirm that all things are being recollected to the beginning in Christ?[fn-12-P1200_320246:88-nf] If he wills us to iterate conjugal connections, how does he maintain that \"our seed is called\" in the but once married Isaac as its author? How does he make monogamy the base of his disposition of the whole Ecclesiastical Order, if this rule does not antecedently hold good in the case of laics, from whose ranks the Ecclesiastical Order proceeds?[fn-12-P1201_320616:89-nf] How does he call away from the enjoyment of marriage such as are still in the married position, saying that \"the time is wound up,\" if he calls back again into marriage such as through death had escaped from marriage? If these (passages) are diverse from that one about which the present question is, it will be agreed (as we have said) that he did not write in that sense of which the Psychics avail themselves; inasmuch as it is easier (of belief) that that one passage should have some explanation agreeable with the others, than that an apostle should seem to have taught (principles) mutually diverse. That explanation we shall be able to discover in the subject-matter itself. What was the subject-matter which led the apostle to write such (words)? The inexperience of a new and just rising Church, which he was rearing, to wit, \"with milk,\" not yet with the \"solid food\"[fn-12-P1202_321526:90-nf] of stronger doctrine; inexperience so great, that that infancy of faith prevented them from yet knowing what they were to do in regard of carnal and sexual necessity. The very phases themselves of this (inexperience) are intelligible from (the apostle's) rescripts, when he says:[fn-12-P1203_321851:91-nf] \"But concerning these (things) which ye write; good it is for a man not to touch a woman; but, on account of fornications, let each one have his own wife.\" He shows that there were who, having been \"apprehended by the faith\" in (the state of) marriage, were apprehensive that it might not be lawful for them thenceforward to enjoy their marriage, because they had believed on the holy flesh of Christ. And yet it is \"by way of allowance\" that he makes the concession, \"not by way of command; \"that is, indulging, not enjoining, the practice. On the other hand, he \"willed rather\" that all should be what he himself was. Similarly, too, in sending a rescript on (the subject of) divorce, he demonstrates that some had been thinking over that also, chiefly because withal they did not suppose that they were to persevere, after faith, in heathen marriages. They sought counsel, further, \"concerning virgins\"-for \"precept of the Lord\" there was none-(and were told) that \"it is good for a man if he so remain permanently; \"(\"so\"), of course, as he may have been found by the faith. \"Thou hast been bound to a wife, seek not loosing; thou hast been loosed from a wife, seek not a wife.\" \"But if thou shalt have taken to (thyself) a wife, thou hast not sinned; \"because to one who, before believing, had been \"loosed from a wife,\" she will not be counted a second wife who, subsequently to believing, is the first: for it is from (the time of our) believing that our life itself dates its origin. But here he says that he \"is sparing them; \"else \"pressure of the flesh\" would shortly follow, in consequence of the straits of the times, which shunned the encumbrances of marriage: yea, rather solicitude must be felt about earning the Lord's favour than a husband's. And thus he recalls his permission. So, then, in the very same passage in which he definitely rules that \"each one ought permanently to remain in that calling in which he shall be called; \"adding, \"A woman is bound so long as her husband liveth; but if he shall have fallen asleep, she is free: whom she shall wish let her marry, only in the Lord,\" he hence also demonstrates that such a woman is to be understood as has withal herself been \"found\" (by the faith) \"loosed from a husband,\" similarly as the husband \"loosed from a wife\"-the \"loosing\" having taken place through death, of course, not through divorce; inasmuch as to the divorced he would grant no permission to marry, in the teeth of the primary precept. And so \"a woman, if she shall have married, will not sin; \"because he will not be reckoned a second husband who is, subsequently to her believing, the first, any more (than a wife thus taken will be counted a second wife). And so truly is this the case, that he therefore adds, \"only in the Lord; \"because the question in agitation was about her who had had a heathen (husband), and had believed subsequently to losing him: for fear, to wit, that she might presume herself able to marry a heathen even after believing; albeit not even this is an object of care to the Psychics. Let us plainly know that, in the Greek original, it does not stand in the form which (through the either crafty or simple alteration of two syllables) has gone out into common use, \"But if her husband shall have fallen asleep,\" as if it were speaking of the future, and thereby seemed to pertain to her who has lost her husband when already in a believing state. If this indeed had been so, licence let loose without limit would have granted a (fresh) husband as often as one had been lost, without any such modesty in marrying as is congruous even to heathens. But even if it had been so, as if referring to future tim, e, \"If any (woman's). husband shall have died, even the future would just as much pertain to her whose husband shall die before she believed. Take it which way you. will, provided you do not overturn the rest. For since these (other passages) agree to the sense (given above): \"Thou hast been called (as) a slave; care not: \"\"Thou hast been called in uncircumcision; be not circumcised: \"\"Thou hast been called in circumcision; become not uncircumcised: \"with which concurs, \"Thou hast been bound to a wife; seek not loosing: thou hast been loosed from a wife; seek not a wife,\"-manifest enough it is that these passages pertain to such as, finding themselves in a new and recent \"calling,\" were consulting (the apostle) on the subject of those (circumstantial conditions) in which they had been \"apprehended\" by the faith.","index":"49","references":[{"fn":"11","code":"P1198_318501","folder":"ANF-04","text":"See Matt. v. 42; Luke vi. 30.
