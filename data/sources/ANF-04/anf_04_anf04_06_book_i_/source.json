For when to an age[fn-2-P280_55168:11-nf] much more ignorant (than ours) they had disclosed certain well-concealed material substances, and several not well-revealed scientific arts-if it is true that they had laid bare the operations of metallurgy, and had divulged the natural properties of herbs, and had promulgated the powers of enchantments, and had traced out every curious art,[fn-2-P281_55527:12-nf] even to the interpretation of the stars-they conferred properly and as it were peculiarly upon women that instrumental mean of womanly ostentation, the radiances of jewels wherewith necklaces are variegated, and the circlets of gold wherewith the arms are compressed, and the medicaments of orchil with which wools are coloured, and that black powder itself wherewith the eyelids and eyelashes are made prominent.[fn-2-P282_56002:13-nf] What is the quality of these things may be declared meantime, even at this point,[fn-2-P283_56136:14-nf] from the quality and condition of their teachers: in that sinners could never have either shown or supplied anything conducive to integrity, unlawful lovers anything conducive to chastity, renegade spirits anything conducive to the fear of God. If (these things) are to be called teachings, ill masters must of necessity have taught ill; if as wages of lust, there is nothing base of which the wages are honourable. But why was it of so much importance to show these things as well as[fn-2-P284_56688:15-nf] to confer them? Was it that women, without material causes of splendour, and without ingenious contrivances of grace, could not please men, who, while still unadorned, and uncouth and-so to say-crude and rude, had moved (the mind of) angels? or was it that the lovers[fn-2-P285_56999:16-nf] would appear sordid and-through gratuitous use-contumelious, if they had conferred no (compensating) gift on the women who had been enticed into connubial connection with them? But these questions admit of no calculation. Women who possessed angels (as husbands) could desire nothing more; they had, forsooth, made a grand match! Assuredly they who, of course, did sometimes think whence they had fallen,[fn-2-P286_57435:17-nf] and, after the heated impulses of their lusts, looked up toward heaven, thus requited that very excellence of women, natural beauty, as (having proved) a cause of evil, in order that their good fortune might profit them nothing; but that, being turned from simplicity and sincerity, they, together with (the angels) themselves, might become offensive to God. Sure they were that all ostentation, and ambition, and love of pleasing by carnal means, was displeasing to God. And these are the angels whom we are destined to judge:[fn-2-P287_57986:18-nf] these are the angels whom in baptism we renounce:[fn-2-P288_58059:19-nf] these, of course, are the reasons why they have deserved to be judged by man. What business, then, have their things with their judges? What commerce have they who are to condemn with them who are to be condemned? The same, I take it, as Christ has with Belial.[fn-2-P289_58349:20-nf] With what consistency do we mount that (future) judgment-seat to pronounce sentence against those whose gifts we (now) seek after? For you too, (women as you are, ) have the self-same angelic nature promised[fn-2-P290_58586:21-nf] as your reward, the self-same sex as men: the self-same advancement to the dignity of judging, does (the Lord) promise you.

But iron, and brass, and other the vilest material substances, enjoy a parity of condition (with silver and gold), both as to earthly origin and metallurgic operation; in order that, in the estimation of nature, the substance of gold and of silver may be judged not a whit more noble (than theirs). But if it is from the quality of utility that gold and silver derive their glory, why, iron and brass excel them; whose usefulness is so disposed (by the Creator), that they not only discharge functions of their own more numerous and more necessary to human affairs, but do also none the less serve the turn of gold and silver, by dint of their own powers,[fn-3-P320_64158:39-nf] in the service of juster causes. For not only are rings made of iron, but the memory of antiquity still preserves (the fame of) certain vessels for eating and drinking made out of brass. Let the insane plenteousness of gold and silver look to it, if it serves to make utensils even for foul purposes. At all events, neither is the field tilled by means of gold, nor the ship fastened together by the strength of silver. No mattock plunges a golden edge into the ground; no nail drives a silver point into planks. I leave unnoticed the fact that the needs of our whole life are dependent upon iron and brass; whereas those rich materials themselves, requiring both to be dug up out of mines, and needing a forging process in every use (to which they are put), are helpless without the laborious vigour of iron and brass.

Thus then, too, with regard to their active use, does the origin of the material substances, which descends from God, excuse (that use) as foreign to God, as guilty forsooth of worldly[fn-3-P342_70982:52-nf] glory!","index":"29","references":[{"fn":"3","code":"P333_68439","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Or, \"slaves.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"3","code":"P334_69444","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Comp. de Paen., c. v. med.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"3","code":"P335_69735","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Comp. c. vi. above.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"3","code":"P336_69902","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Saecularium.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"3","code":"P337_69989","folder":"ANF-04","text":"i.e., the treatise de Spectaculis.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"3","code":"P338_70110","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Rebus.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"3","code":"P339_70174","folder":"ANF-04","text":"\"Affici\" - a rare use rather of \"afficere,\" but found in Cic.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"3","code":"P340_70554","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Or perhaps \"is fed\" thereby; for the word is \"vescitur.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"3","code":"P341_70694","folder":"ANF-04","text":"\"Conditio\" - a rare use again.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"3","code":"P342_70982","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Saecularis.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter IX.-God's Distribution Must Regulate Our Desires, Otherwise We Become the Prey of Ambition and Its Attendant Evils.","index":10,"paragraphs":[{"text":"For, as some particular things distributed by God over certain individual lands, and some one particular tract of sea, are mutually foreign one to the other, they are reciprocally either neglected or desired: (desired) among foreigners, as being rarities; neglected (rightly), if anywhere, among their own compatriots, because in them there is no such fervid longing for a glory which, among its own home-folk, is frigid. But, however, the rareness and outlandishness which arise out of that distribution of possessions which God has ordered as He willed, ever finding favour in the eyes of strangers, excites, from the simple fact of not having what God has made native to other places, the concupiscence of having it. Hence is educed another vice-that of immoderate having; because although, perhaps, having may be permissible, still a limit[fn-3-P346_71973:53-nf] is bound (to be observed). This (second vice) will be ambition; and hence, too, its name is to be interpreted, in that from concupiscence ambient in the mind it is born, with a view to the desire of glory,-a grand desire, forsooth, which (as we have said) is recommended neither by nature nor by truth, but by a vicious passion of the mind,-(namely, ) concupiscence. And there are other vices connected with ambition and glory. Thus they have withal enhanced the cost of things, in order that (thereby) they might add fuel to themselves also; for concupiscence becomes proportionably greater as it has set a higher value upon the thing which it has eagerly desired. From the smallest caskets is produced an ample patrimony. On a single thread is suspended a million of sesterces. One delicate neck carries about it forests and islands.[fn-3-P347_72832:54-nf] The slender lobes of the ears exhaust a fortune; and the left hand, with its every finger, sports with a several money-bag.
