The touching story, borrowed from Clement of Alexandria, is related by Eusebius. \"And will they,\" says Clement, \"reject even the apostles? Peter and Philip, indeed, had children; Philip also gave his daughters in marriage. to husbands; and Paul does not demur, in a certain Epistle, to mention his own wife, whom he did not take about with him, in order to expedite his ministry the better.\" Of St. Peter and his wife, Eusebius subjoins, \"Such was the marriage of these blessed ones, and such was their perfect affection.\"[fn-9-P939_227714:68-nf] ","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"9","code":"P939_227714","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Eccl.

Even Rome relaxes her discipline for the Uniats, and hundreds of her priesthood, therefore, live in honourable marriage. Thousands live in secret marriage, but their wives are dishonoured as \"concubines.\" It was not till the eleventh century that the celibate was enforced. In England it was never successfully imposed; and, though the \"priest's leman\" was not called his wife (to the disgrace of the whole system), she was yet honoured (see Chaucer), and often carried herself too proudly.","index":"4","references":[]},{"text":"The enormous evils of an enforced celibacy need not here be remarked upon.
