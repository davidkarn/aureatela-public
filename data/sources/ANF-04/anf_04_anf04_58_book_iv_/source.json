And we pray that words may be given us, as it is written in the book of Jeremiah that the Lord said to the prophet: \"Behold, I have put My words in thy mouth as fire. See, I have set thee this day over the nations, and over the kingdoms, to root out and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, and to build and to plant.\"[fn-89-P8984_2303487:1-nf] For we need words now which will root out of every wounded soul the reproaches uttered against the truth by this treatise of Celsus, or which proceed from opinions like his. And we need also thoughts which will pull down all edifices based on false opinions, and especially the edifice raised by Celsus in his work which resembles the building of those who said \"Come, let us build us a city, and a tower whose top shall reach to heaven.\"[fn-89-P8985_2303948:2-nf] Yea, we even require a wisdom which will throw down all high things that rise against the knowledge of God,[fn-89-P8986_2304075:3-nf] and especially that height of arrogance which Celsus displays against us. And in the next place, as we must not stop with rooting out and pulling down the hindrances which have just been mentioned, but must, in room of what has been rooted out, plant the plants of \"God's husbandry; \"[fn-89-P8987_2304380:4-nf] mad in place of what has been pulled down, rear up the building of God, and the temple of His glory,-we must for that reason pray also to the Lord, who bestowed the gifts named in the book of Jeremiah, that He may grant even to us words adapted both for building up the (temple) of Christ, and for planting the spiritual law, and the prophetic words referring to the same.[fn-89-P8988_2304775:5-nf] And above all is it necessary to show, as against the assertions of Celsus which follow those he has already made, that the prophecies regarding Christ are true predictions. For, arraying himself at the same time against both parties-against the Jews on the one hand, who deny that the advent of Christ has taken place, but who expect it as future, and against Christians on the other, who acknowledge that Jesus is the Christ spoken of in prophecy-he makes the following statement:-","index":"101","references":[{"fn":"89","code":"P8984_2303487","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Cf.

For he means those who prove from the Jewish Scriptures that the advent of Christ has already taken place, and he seems to know that there are certain heretical sects which deny that Christ Jesus was predicted by the prophets. In the preceding pages, however, we have already discussed, to the best of our ability, the question of Christ having been the subject of prophecy, and therefore, to avoid tautology, we do not repeat much that might be advanced upon this head. Observe, now, that if he had wished with a kind of apparent force[fn-89-P8993_2306470:7-nf] to subvert faith in the prophetic writings, either with regard to the future or past advent of Christ, he ought to have set forth the prophecies themselves which we Christians and Jews quote in our discussions with each other. For in this way he would have appeared to turn aside those who are carried away by the plausible character[fn-89-P8994_2306822:8-nf] of the prophetic statements, as he regards it, from assenting to their truth, and from believing, on account of these prophecies, that Jesus is the Christ; whereas now, being unable to answer the prophecies relating to Christ, or else not knowing at all what are the prophecies relating to Him, he brings forward no prophetic declaration, although there are countless numbers which refer to Christ; but he thinks that he prefers an accusation against the prophetic Scriptures, while he does not even state what he himself would call their \"plausible character!\" He is not, however, aware that it is not at all the Jews who say that Christ will descend as a God, or the Son of a God, as we have shown in the foregoing pages. And when he asserts that \"he is said by us to have already come, but by the Jews that his advent as Messiah[fn-89-P8995_2307671:9-nf] is still future,\" he appears by the very charge to censure our statement as one that is most shameless, and which needs no lengthened refutation.","index":"103","references":[{"fn":"89","code":"P8992_2305563","folder":"ANF-04","text":"dikaiwth/j.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"89","code":"P8993_2306470","folder":"ANF-04","text":"a0kolouqi/aj.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"89","code":"P8994_2306822","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Piqano/thtoj.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"89","code":"P8995_2307671","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Dikaiwth/sm not Dikasth/j.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter III.","index":4,"paragraphs":[{"text":"And he continues: \"What is the meaning of such a descent upon the part of God? \"not observing that, according to our teaching, the meaning of the descent is pre-eminently to convert what are called in the Gospel the lost \"sheep of the house of Israel; \"and secondly, to take away from them, on account of their disobedience, what is called the \"kingdom of God,\" and to give to other husbandmen than the ancient Jews, viz. to the Christians, who will render to God the fruits of His kingdom in due season (each action being a \"fruit of the kingdom\").[fn-89-P8999_2308409:10-nf] We shall therefore, out of a greater number, select a few remarks by way of answer to the question of Celsus, when he says, \"What is the meaning of such a descent upon the part of God? \"And Celsus here returns to himself an answer which would have been given neither by Jews nor by us, when he asks, \"Was it in order to learn what goes on amongst men? \"For not one of us asserts that it was in order to learn what goes on amongst men that Christ entered into this life. Immediately after, however, as if some would reply that it was \"in order to learn what goes on among men,\" he makes this objection to his own statement: \"Does he not know all things? \"Then, as if we were to answer that He does know all things, he raises a new question, saying, \"Then he does know, but does not make (men) better, nor is it possible for him by means of his divine power to make (men) better.\" Now all this on his part is silly talk;[fn-90-P9000_2309471:11-nf] for God, by means of His word, which is continually passing from generation to generation into holy souls, and constituting them friends of God and prophets, does improve those who listen to His words; and by the coming of Christ He improves, through the doctrine of Christianity, not those who are unwilling, but those who have chosen the better life, and that which is pleasing to God. I do not know, moreover, what kind of improvement Celsus wished to take place when he raised the objection, asking, \"Is it then not possible for him, by means of his divine power, to make (men) better, unless he send some one for that special purpose? \"[fn-90-P9001_2310128:12-nf] Would he then have the improvement to take place by God's filling the minds of men with new ideas, removing at once the (inherent) wickedness, and implanting virtue (in its stead)?[fn-90-P9002_2310461:13-nf] Another person now would inquire whether this was not inconsistent or impossible in the very nature of things; we, however, would say, \"Grant it to be so, and let it be possible.\" Where, then, is our free will?[fn-90-P9003_2310845:14-nf] and what credit is there in assenting to the truth? or how is the rejection of what is false praiseworthy? But even if it were once granted that such a course was not only possible, but could be accomplished with propriety (by God), why would not one rather inquire (asking a question like that of Celsus) why it was not possible for God, by means of His divine power, to create men who needed no improvement, but who were of themselves virtuous and perfect, evil being altogether non-existent? These questions may perplex ignorant and foolish individuals, but not him who sees into the nature of things; for if you take away the spontaneity of virtue, you destroy its essence. But it would need an entire treatise to discuss these matters; and on this subject the Greeks have expressed themselves at great length in their works on providence. They truly would not say what Celsus has expressed in words, that \"God knows (all things) indeed, but does not make (men) better, nor is able to do so by His divine power.\" We ourselves have spoken in many parts of our writings on these points to the best of our ability, and the Holy Scriptures have established the same to those who are able to understand them.","index":"105","references":[{"fn":"89","code":"P8999_2308409","folder":"ANF-04","text":"tou\\j karpou=j th=j tou= Qeou basilsi9aj a0podw/sousi tw=| Qew=|, e0n toi=j e9ka/sthj pra/cewj ou!shj karpou= th=j basilei/aj kairoi=j|..","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"90","code":"P9000_2309471","folder":"ANF-04","text":"eu0h/qwj.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"90","code":"P9001_2310128","folder":"ANF-04","text":"The word fu/sei which is found in the text seems out of place, and has been omitted in the translation, agreeably to the emendation of Boherellus.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"90","code":"P9002_2310461","folder":"ANF-04","text":"'Ara fa\\r h!qele fantasioume/noij toi=j a0nqrw/poij u9po= Qeou=, a0peilhfo/toj me\\n a/qro/wj th\\n kaki/an. emfu/ontoj di\\ th\\n a0reth\\n, th=n e0panoi/rqwdin gene/sqai;","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"90","code":"P9003_2310845","folder":"ANF-04","text":"'Ara fa\\r h!qele fantasioume/noij toi=j a0nqrw/poij u9po= Qeou=, a0peilhfo/toj me\\n a/qro/wj th\\n kaki/an. emfu/ontoj di\\ th\\n a0reth\\n, th=n e0panoi/rqwdin gene/sqai;","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter IV.","index":5,"paragraphs":[{"text":"The argument which Celsus employs against us and the Jews will be turned against himself thus: My good sir, does the God who is over all things know what takes place among men, or does He not know?

But there are many diversities amongst those who serve God, and they are few in number who are perfect and pure ambassadors of the truth, and who produce a complete reformation, as did Moses and the prophets.

But the power and divinity of God comes through him whom God chooses, and resides in him in whom it finds a place, not changing its situation, nor leaving its own place empty and filling another: for, in speaking of His quitting one place and occupying another, we do not mean such expressions to be taken topically; but we say that the soul of the bad man, and of him who is overwhelmed in wickedness, is abandoned by God, while we mean that the soul of him who wishes to live virtuously, or of him who is making progress (in a virtuous life), or who is already living conform-ably thereto, is filled with or becomes a partaker of the Divine Spirit. It is not necessary, then, for the descent of Christ, or for the coming of God to men, that He should abandon a greater seat, and that things on earth should be changed, as Celsus imagines when he says, \"If you were to change a single one, even the least, of things on earth, all things would be overturned and disappear.\" And if we must speak of a change in any one by the appearing of the power of God, and by the entrance of the word among men, we shall not be reluctant to speak of changing from a wicked to a virtuous, from a dissolute to a temperate, and from a superstitious to a religious life, the person who has allowed the word of God to find entrance into his soul.","index":"109","references":[{"fn":"90","code":"P9011_2313788","folder":"ANF-04","text":"lennaio/tatoj.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"90","code":"P9012_2314197","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Wisd.

Nay, not even with the desire to try those who do or who do not believe upon Him, does He, by His unspeakable and divine power, Himself take up His abode in certain individuals, or send His Christ; but He does this in order to liberate from all their wretchedness those who do believe upon Him, and who accept His divinity, and that those who do not believe may no longer have this as a ground of excuse, viz., that their unbelief is the consequence of their not having heard the word of instruction.

But no sick man or lunatic is a friend of God, nor does God fear any one to such a degree as to shun danger by leading him into error.\" Now the answer to these statements might have respect partly to the nature of the Divine Word, who is God, and partly to the soul of Jesus. As respects the nature of the Word, in the same way as the quality of the food changes in the nurse into milk with reference to the nature of the child, or is arranged by the physician with a view to the good of his health in the case of a sick man or (is specially) prepared for a stronger man, because he possesses greater vigour, so does God appropriately change, in the case of each individual, the power of the Word to which belongs the natural property of nourishing the human soul. And to one is given, as the Scripture terms it, \"the sincere milk of the word; \"and to another, who is weaker, as it were, \"herbs; \"and to another who is full-grown, \"strong meat.\" And the Word does not, I imagine, prove false to His own nature, in contributing nourishment to each one, according as he is capable of receiving Him.[fn-91-P9103_2341117:71-nf] Nor does He mislead or prove false. But if one were to take the change as referring to the soul of Jesus after it had entered the body, we would inquire in what sense the term \"change\" is used.

And the Divine Word, well knowing this, speaks to that effect in many passages of Scripture, although it is sufficient at present to quote one testimony of Paul to the following effect: \"Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus; who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

According to Celsus, the Jews say that \"(human) life, being filled with all wickedness, needed one sent from God, that the wicked might be punished, and all things purified in a manner analogous to the first deluge which happened.\" And as the Christians are said to make statements additional to this, it is evident that he alleges that they admit these.

For, in order that the narrative contained in Genesis respecting the tower may be held to convey no secret meaning, but, as Celsus supposes, may be taken as true to the letter,[fn-91-P9118_2347350:77-nf] the event does not on such a view appear to have taken place for the purpose of purifying the earth; unless, indeed, he imagines that the so-called confusion of tongues is such a purificatory process. But on this point, he who has the opportunity will treat more seasonably when his object is to show not only what is the meaning of the narrative in its historical connection, but what metaphorical meaning may be deduced from it.[fn-91-P9119_2347794:78-nf] Seeing that he imagines, however, that Moses, who wrote the account of the tower, and the confusion of tongues, has perverted the story of the sons of Aloeus,[fn-91-P9120_2348100:79-nf] and referred it to the tower, we must remark that I do not think any one prior to the time of Homer[fn-91-P9121_2348268:80-nf] has mentioned the sons of Aloeus, while I am persuaded that what is related about the tower has been recorded by Moses as being much older not only than Homer, but even than the invention of letters among the Greeks. Who, then, are the perverters of each other's narratives? Whether do they who relate the story of the Aloadae pervert the history of the time, or he who wrote the account of the tower and the confusion of tongues the story of the Aloadae? Now to impartial hearers Moses appears to be more ancient than Homer. The destruction by fire, moreover, of Sodom and Gomorrah on account of their sins, related by Moses in Genesis, is compared by Celsus to the story of Phaethon,-all these statements of his resulting from one blunder, viz., his not attending to the (greater) antiquity of Moses.[fn-91-P9122_2349103:81-nf] For they who relate the story of Phaethon seem to be younger even than Homer, who, again, is much younger than Moses. We do not deny, then, that the purificatory fire and the destruction of the world took place in order that evil might be swept away, and all things be renewed; for we assert that we have learned these things from the sacred books of the prophets. But since, as we have said in the preceding pages, the prophets, in uttering many predictions regarding future events, show that they have spoken the truth concerning many things that are past, and thus give evidence of the indwelling of the Divine Spirit, it is manifest that, with respect to things still future, we should repose faith in them, or rather in the Divine Spirit that is in them.

For forty and two years, I think, after the date of the crucifixion of Jesus, did the destruction of Jerusalem take place.

And as it was the will of God that the doctrine of Jesus should prevail amongst men, the demons could effect nothing, although straining every nerve[fn-92-P9219_2378999:145-nf] to accomplish the destruction of Christians; for they stirred up both princes, and senates, and rulers in every place,-nay, even nations themselves, who did not perceive the irrational and wicked procedure of the demons,-against the word, and those who believed in it; yet, notwithstanding, the word of God, which is more powerful than all other things, even when meeting with opposition, deriving from the opposition, as it were, a means of increase, advanced onwards, and won many souls, such being the will of God. And we have offered these remarks by way of a necessary digression. For we wished to answer the assertion of Celsus concerning the Jews, that they were \"fugitives from Egypt, and that these men, beloved by God, never accomplished anything worthy of note.\" And further, in answer to the statement that \"they were never held in any reputation or account,\" we say, that living apart as a \"chosen nation and a royal priesthood,\" and shunning intercourse with the many nations around them, in order that their morals might escape corruption, they enjoyed the protection of the divine power, neither coveting like the most of mankind the acquisition of other kingdoms, nor yet being abandoned so as to become, on account of their smallness, an easy object of attack to others, and thus be altogether destroyed; and this lasted so long as they were worthy of the divine protection. But when it became necessary for them, as a nation wholly given to sin, to be brought back by their sufferings to their God, they were abandoned (by Him), sometimes for a longer, sometimes for a shorter period, until in the time of the Romans, having committed the greatest of sins in putting Jesus to death, they were completely deserted.","index":"162","references":[{"fn":"92","code":"P9218_2378272","folder":"ANF-04","text":"qei/a| moi/ra|.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"92","code":"P9219_2378999","folder":"ANF-04","text":"kai/toige pa/nta xa/lwn kinh/santej.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter XXXIII.","index":33,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Immediately after this, Celsus, assailing the contents of the first book of Moses, which is entitled \"Genesis,\" asserts that \"the Jews accordingly endeavoured to derive their origin from the first race of jugglers and deceivers,[fn-92-P9223_2381019:146-nf] appealing to the testimony of dark and ambiguous words, whose meaning was veiled in obscurity, and which they misinterpreted[fn-92-P9224_2381206:147-nf] to the unlearned and ignorant, and that, too, when such a point had never been called in question during the long preceding period.\" Now Celsus appears to me in these words to have expressed very obscurely the meaning which he intended to convey.

It is certain, however, that the Jews trace their genealogy back to the three fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

Now, let him who chooses show who these are that dispute with the Jews, and who adduce even probable arguments to show that Jews and Christians do not decide correctly on the points relating to these names, but that there are others who have discussed these questions with the greatest learning and accuracy.

The words of Plato are as follow: \"When Aphrodite was born, the gods held a banquet, and there was present, along with the others, Porus the son of Metis. And after they had dined, Penia[fn-93-P9325_2399884:176-nf] came to beg for something (seeing there was an entertainment), and she stood at the gate. Porus meantime, having become intoxicated with the nectar (for there was then no wine), went into the garden of Zeus, and, being heavy with liquor, lay down to sleep. Penia accordingly formed a secret plot, with a view of freeing herself from her condition of poverty,[fn-93-P9326_2400284:177-nf] to get a child by Porus, and accordingly lay down beside him, and became pregnant with Eros. And on this account Eros has become the follower and attendant of Aphrodite, having been begotten on her birthday feast,[fn-93-P9327_2400534:178-nf] and being at the same time by nature a lover of the beautiful, because Aphrodite too is beautiful. Seeing, then, that Eros is the son of Porus and Penia, the following is his condition.[fn-93-P9328_2400760:179-nf] In the first place, he is always poor, and far from being delicate and beautiful, as most persons imagine; but is withered, and sunburnt,[fn-93-P9329_2400938:180-nf] and unshod, and without a home, sleeping always upon the ground, and without a covering; lying in the open air beside gates, and on public roads; possessing the nature of his mother, and dwelling continually with indigence.[fn-93-P9330_2401194:181-nf] But, on the other hand, in conformity with the character of his father, he is given to plotting against the beautiful and the good, being courageous, and hasty, and vehement;[fn-93-P9331_2401386:182-nf] a keen[fn-93-P9332_2401411:183-nf] hunter, perpetually devising contrivances; both much given to forethought, and also fertile in resources;[fn-93-P9333_2401533:184-nf] acting like a philosopher throughout the whole of his life; a terrible[fn-93-P9334_2401642:185-nf] sorcerer, and dealer in drugs, and a sophist as well; neither immortal by nature nor yet mortal, but on the same day, at one time he flourishes and lives when he has plenty, and again at another time dies, and once more is recalled to life through possessing the nature of his father. But the supplies furnished to him are always gradually disappearing, so that he is never at any time in want, nor yet rich; and, on the other hand, he occupies an intermediate position between wisdom and ignorance.\"[fn-93-P9335_2402165:186-nf] Now, if those who read these words were to imitate the malignity of Celsus-which be it far from Christians to do!-they would ridicule the myth, and would turn this great Plato into a subject of jest; but if, on investigating in a philosophic spirit what is conveyed in the dress of a myth, they should be able to discover the meaning of Plato, (they will admire)[fn-93-P9336_2402573:187-nf] the manner in which he was able to conceal, on account of the multitude, in the form of this myth, the great ideas which presented themselves to him, and to speak in a befitting manner to those who know how to ascertain from the myths the true meaning of him who wove them together. Now I have brought forward this myth occurring in the writings of Plato, because of the mention in it of the garden of Zeus, which appears to bear some resemblance to the paradise of God, and of the comparison between Penia and the serpent, and the plot against Porus by Penia, which may be compared with the plot of the serpent against the man. It is not very clear, indeed, whether Plato fell in with these stories by chance, or whether, as some think, meeting during his visit to Egypt with certain individuals who philosophized on the Jewish mysteries, and learning some things from them, he may have preserved a few of their ideas, and thrown others aside, being careful not to offend the Greeks by a complete adoption of all the points of the philosophy of the Jews, who were in bad repute with the multitude, on account of the foreign character of their laws and their peculiar polity. The present, however, is not the proper time for explaining either the myth of Plato, or the story of the serpent and the paradise of God, and all that is related to have taken place in it, as in our exposition of the book of Genesis we have especially occupied ourselves as we best could with these matters.

The nature of actions-good, bad, and indifferent-has been investigated by the Greeks; and the more successful of such investigators[fn-93-P9387_2416870:220-nf] lay down the principle that intention alone gives to actions the character of good or bad, and that all things which are done without a purpose are, strictly speaking, indifferent; that when the intention is directed to a becoming end, it is praiseworthy; when the reverse, it is censurable. They have said, accordingly, in the section relating to\" things indifferent,\" that, strictly speaking, for a man to have sexual intercourse with his daughters is a thing indifferent, although such a thing ought not to take place in established communities. And for the sake of hypothesis, in order to show that such an act belongs to the class of things indifferent, they have assumed the case of a wise man being left with an only daughter, the entire human race besides having perished; and they put the question whether the father can fitly have intercourse with his daughter, in order, agreeably to the supposition, to prevent the extermination of mankind. Is this to be accounted sound reasoning among the Greeks, and to be commended by the influential[fn-93-P9388_2417961:221-nf] sect of the Stoics; but when young maidens, who had heard of the burning of the world, though without comprehending (its full meaning), saw fire devastating their city and country, and supposing that the only means left of rekindling the flame[fn-93-P9389_2418244:222-nf] of human life lay in their father and themselves, should, on such a supposition, conceive the desire that the world should continue, shall their conduct be deemed worse than that of the wise man who, according to the hypothesis of the Stoics, acts becomingly in having intercourse with his daughter in the case already supposed, of all men having been destroyed? I am not unaware, however, that some have taken offence at the desire[fn-93-P9390_2418694:223-nf] of Lot's daughters, and have regarded their conduct as very wicked; and have said that two accursed nations-Moab and Ammon-have sprung from that unhallowed intercourse. And yet truly sacred Scripture is nowhere found distinctly approving of their conduct as good, nor yet passing sentence upon it as blameworthy.

Now it appears to follow from the position, that there never have been, nor are now, nor ever will be, more or fewer evils in the world; that as, according to the view of those who hold the indestructibility of the world, the equipoise of the elements is maintained by a Providence (which does not permit one to gain the preponderance over the others, in order to prevent the destruction of the world), so a kind of Providence presides, as it were, over evils (the number of which is fixed),[fn-94-P9495_2457600:274-nf] to prevent their being either increased or diminished!

But after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God.\" How, then, can any one treasure up for himself \"wrath\" against a \"day of wrath,\" if \"wrath\" be understood in the sense of \"passion? \"or how can the \"passion of wrath\" be a help to discipline?

Moreover, even if the ants set apart in a place by themselves those grains which sprout forth, that they may not swell into bud, but may continue throughout the year as their food, this is not to be deemed as evidence of the existence of reason among ants, but as the work of the universal mother, Nature, which adorned even irrational animals, so that even the most insignificant is not omitted, but bears traces of the reason implanted in it by nature.

Christians, however, will not yield their assent to such opinions: for they have been instructed before now that the human soul was created in the image of God; and they see that it is impossible for a nature fashioned in the divine image to have its (original) features altogether obliterated, and to assume others, formed after I know not what likeness of irrational animals.","index":"322","references":[{"fn":"96","code":"P9618_2501768","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Paraba/lh| tw=| lo/gw| pro\\j touj mu/rmhkaj. \"Verba: ta| lo/gw| pro\\j rouj murmhkaj addititia videntur et recidenda.\" - RUAEUS.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"96","code":"P9619_2502557","folder":"ANF-04","text":"e0pai>\\/wn.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"96","code":"P9620_2503039","folder":"ANF-04","text":"to\\ koinwniko/n.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter LXXXIV.","index":84,"paragraphs":[{"text":"And since he asserts that, \"when ants die, the survivors set apart a special place (for their interment), and that their ancestral sepulchres such a place is,\" we have to answer, that the greater the laudations which he heaps upon irrational animals, so much the more does he magnify (although against his will) the work of that reason which arranged all things in order, and points out the skill[fn-96-P9624_2505403:336-nf] which exists among men, and which is capable of adorning by its reason even the gifts which are bestowed by nature on the irrational creation.

We ought then to go to the birds as our teachers, in order that as, according to the view of Celsus, they instruct us by their power of divination in the knowledge of future events, so also they may free men from doubts regarding the Divine Being, by imparting to them the clear ideas which they have obtained respecting Him! It follows, accordingly, that Celsus, who regards birds as superior to men, ought to employ them as his instructors, and not one of the Greek philosophers.","index":"334","references":[]}]},{"name":"Chapter XC.","index":90,"paragraphs":[{"text":"But we have a few remarks to make, out of a larger number, in answer to these statements of Celsus, that we may show the ingratitude towards his Maker which is involved in his holding these false opinions.[fn-96-P9663_2519534:357-nf] For Celsus, although a man, and \"being in honour,\"[fn-96-P9664_2519623:358-nf] does not possess understanding, and therefore he did not compare himself with the birds and the other irrational animals, which he regards as capable of divining; but yielding to them the foremost place, he lowered himself, and as far as he could the whole human race with him (as entertaining lower and inferior views of God than the irrational animals), beneath the Egyptians, who worship irrational animals as divinities. Let the principal point of investigation, however, be this: whether there actually is or not an art of divination, by means of birds and other living things believed to have such power. For the arguments which tend to establish either view are not to be despised. On the one hand, it is pressed upon us not to admit such an art, lest the rational being should abandon the divine oracles, and betake himself to birds; and on the other, there is the energetic testimony of many, that numerous individuals have been saved from the greatest dangers by putting their trust in divination by birds. For the present, however, let it be granted that an art of divination does exist, in order that I may in this way show to those who are prejudiced on the subject, that if this be admitted, the superiority of man over irrational animals, even over those that are endowed with power of divination, is great, and beyond all reach of comparison with the latter. We have then to say, that if there was in them any divine nature capable of foretelling future events, and so rich (in that knowledge) as out of its superabundance to make them known to any man who wished to know them, it is manifest that they would know what concerned themselves far sooner (than what concerned others); and had they possessed this knowledge, they would have been upon their guard against flying to any particular place where men had planted snares and nets to catch them, or where archers took aim and shot at them in their flight. And especially, were eagles aware beforehand of the designs formed against their young, either by serpents crawling up to their nests and destroying them, or by men who take them for their amusement, or for any other useful purpose or service, they would not have placed their young in a spot where they were to be attacked; and, in general, not one of these animals would have been captured by men, because they were more divine and intelligent than they.

For it follows from his maintaining such a position, that if these animals be more beloved by God than human beings, it is manifest that they are dearer to God than Socrates, and Plato, and Pythagoras, and Pherecydes, and those theologians whose praises he had sung a little before. And one might address him with the prayer: \"If these animals be dearer to God than men, may you be beloved of God along with them, and be made like to those whom you consider as dearer to Him than human beings!\" And let no one suppose that such a prayer is meant as an imprecation; for who would not pray to resemble in all respects those whom he believes to be dearer to God than others, in order that he, like them, may enjoy the divine love?

Yet it is the virtuous alone who are truly wise, for no wicked man is so. He speaks, accordingly, in the following style: \"Intelligent men say that these animals hold assemblies which are more sacred than ours, and that they know what is spoken at them, and actually prove that they are not without such knowledge, when they mention beforehand that the birds have announced their intention of departing to a particular place, or of doing this thing or that, and then show that they have departed to the place in question, and have done the particular thing which was foretold.\" Now, truly, no person of intelligence ever related such things; nor did any wise man ever say that the assemblies of the irrational animals were more sacred than those of men. But if, for the purpose of examining (the soundness of) his statements, we look to their consequences, it is evident that, in his opinion, the assemblies of the irrational animals are more sacred than those of the venerable Pherecydes, and Pythagoras, and Socrates, and Plato, and of philosophers in general; which assertion is not only incongruous[fn-97-P9745_2535977:383-nf] in itself, but full of absurdity.

But I am not aware that any one has spoken of its observance of oaths; unless indeed to its gentle disposition, and its observance of compacts, so to speak, when once concluded between it and man, he give the name of keeping its oath, which statement also in itself is false.

And if Celsus had known how great the difference is between acting in this way from reason, and from an irrational natural impulse, he would not have said that storks are more pious than human beings. But further, Celsus, as still contending for the piety of the irrational creation, quotes the instance of the Arabian bird the phoenix, which after many years repairs to Egypt, and bears thither its parent, when dead and buried in a ball of myrrh, and deposits its body in the Temple of the Sun. Now this story is indeed recorded, and, if it be true,[fn-97-P9750_2538503:385-nf] it is possible that it may occur in consequence of some provision of nature; divine providence freely displaying to human beings, by the differences which exist among living things, the variety of constitution which prevails in the world, and which extends even to birds, and in harmony with which He has brought into existence one creature, the only one of its kind, in order that by it men may be led to admire, not the creature, but Him who created it.","index":"387","references":[{"fn":"97","code":"P9749_2537542","folder":"ANF-04","text":"a0ntipelargou=ntoj.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"97","code":"P9750_2538503","folder":"ANF-04","text":"See vol. i. pp. viii., 12, this series.

For this reason all things have been adjusted, not with reference to each other, but with regard to their bearing upon the whole.[fn-97-P9754_2539471:386-nf] And God takes care of the whole, and (His) providence will never forsake it; and it does not become worse; nor does God after a time bring it back to himself; nor is He angry on account of men any more than on account of apes or flies; nor does He threaten these beings, each one of which has received its appointed lot in its proper place.\" Let us then briefly reply to these statements. I think, indeed, that I have shown in the preceding pages that all things were created for man, and every rational being, and that it was chiefly for the sake of the rational creature that the creation took place. Celsus, indeed, may say that this was done not more for man than for lions, or the other creatures which he mentions; but we maintain that the Creator did not form these things for lions, or eagles, or dolphins, but all for the sake of the rational creature, and \"in order that this world, as being God's work, might be perfect and complete in all things.\" For to this sentiment we must yield our assent as being well said. And God takes care, not, as Celsus supposes, merely of the whole, but beyond the whole, in a special degree of every rational being. Nor will Providence ever abandon the whole; for although it should become more wicked, owing to the sin of the rational being, which is a portion of the whole, He makes arrangements to purify it, and after a time to bring back the whole to Himself. Moreover, He is not angry with apes or flies; but on human beings, as those who have transgressed the laws of nature, He sends judgments and chastisements, and threatens them by the mouth of the prophets, and by the Saviour who came to visit the whole human race, that those who hear the threatenings may be converted by them, while those who neglect these calls to conversion may deservedly suffer those punishments which it becomes God, in conformity with that will of His which acts for the advantage of the whole, to inflict upon those who need such painful discipline and correction.
