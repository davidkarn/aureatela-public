Let them see to that, who, among the rest of their perversities, teach the disjoining of the \"one flesh in twain; \"[fn-7-P739_179360:23-nf] denying Him who, after borrowing the female from the male, recombined between themselves, in the matrimonial computation, the two bodies taken out of the consortship of the self-same material substance. In short, there is no place at all where we read that nuptials are prohibited; of course on the ground that they are \"a good thing.\" What, however, is better than this \"good,\" we learn from the apostle, who permits marrying indeed, but prefers abstinence; the former on account of the insidiousnesses of temptations, the latter on account of he straits of the times.[fn-7-P740_179952:24-nf] Now, by looking into the reason thus given for each proposition, it is easily discerned that the ground on which the power of marrying is conceded is necessity; but whatever necessity grants, she by her very nature depreciates. In fact, in that it is written, \"To marry is better than to burn,\" what, pray, is the nature of this \"good\" which is (only) commended by comparison with \"evil,\" so that the reason why\" marrying\" is more good is (merely) that \"burning\" is less? Nay, but how far better is it neither to marry nor to burn? Why, even in persecutions it is better to take advantage of the permission granted, and \"flee from town to town,\"[fn-7-P741_180615:25-nf] than, when apprehended and racked, to deny (the faith).[fn-7-P742_180722:26-nf] And therefore more blessed are they who have strength to depart (this life) in blessed confession of their testimony.[fn-7-P743_180907:27-nf] I may say, What is permitted is not good. For how stands the case? I must of necessity die (if I be apprehended and confess my faith.) If I think (that fate) deplorable, (then flight) is good; but if I have a fear of the thing which is permitted, (the permitted thing) has some suspicion attaching to the cause of its permission. But that which is \"better\" no one (ever) \"permitted,\" as being undoubted, and manifest by its own inherent purity. There are some things which are not to be desired merely because they are not forbidden, albeit they are in a certain sense forbidden when other things are preferred to them; for the preference given to the higher things is a dissuasion from the lowest. A thing is not \"good\" merely because it is not \"evil,\" nor is it \"evil\" merely because it is not \"harmful.\"[fn-7-P744_181778:28-nf] Further: that which is fully \"good\" excels on this ground, that it is not only not harmful, but profitable into the bargain. For you are bound to prefer what is profitable to what is (merely) not harmful. For the first place is what every struggle aims at; the second has consolation attaching to it, but not victory. But if we listen to the apostle, forgetting what is behind, let us both strain after what is before,[fn-7-P745_182213:29-nf] and be followers after the better rewards. Thus, albeit he does not \"east a snare[fn-7-P746_182319:30-nf] upon us,\" he points out what tends to utility when he says, \"The unmarried woman thinks on the things of the Lord, that both in body and spirit she may be holy; but the married is solicitous how to please her husband.\"[fn-7-P747_182655:31-nf] But he nowhere permits marriage in such a way as not rather to wish us to do our utmost in imitation of his own example.

If the spirit is stronger than the flesh, because it is withal of nobler origin, it is our own fault if we follow the weaker. Now there are two phases[fn-7-P755_183759:36-nf] of human weakness which make marriages[fn-7-P756_183812:37-nf] necessary to such as are disjoined from matrimony. The first and most powerful is that which arises from fleshly concupiscence; the second, from worldly concupiscence. But by us, who are servants of God, who renounce both voluptuousness and ambition, each is to be repudiated. Fleshly concupiscence claims the functions of adult age, craves after beauty's harvest, rejoices in its own shame, pleads the necessity of a husband to the female sex, as a source of authority and of comfort, or to render it safe from evil rumours. To meet these its counsels, do you apply the examples of sisters of ours whose names are with the Lord,[fn-7-P757_184600:38-nf] -who, when their husbands have preceded them (to glory), give to no opportunity of beauty or of age the precedence over holiness.

Thus they have laid hold for themselves of an eternal gift of the Lord; and while on earth, by abstaining from marriage, are already counted as belonging to the angelic family.

When anything seems difficult, let us survey others who cope with still greater difficulties. How many are there who from the moment of their baptism set the seal (of virginity) upon their flesh? How many, again, who by equal mutual consent cancel the debt of matrimony-voluntary eunuchs[fn-7-P792_191416:65-nf] for the sake of their desire! after the celestial kingdom! But if, while the marriage-tie is still intact, abstinence is endured, how much more when it has been undone! For I believe it to be harder for what is intact to be quite forsaken, than for what has been lost not to be yearned after. A hard and arduous thing enough, surely, is the continence for God's sake of a holy woman after her husband's decease, when Gentiles,[fn-7-P793_191919:66-nf] in honour of their own Satan, endure sacerdotal offices which involve both virginity and widowhood![fn-7-P794_192045:67-nf] At Rome, for instance, they who have to do with the type of that \"inextinguishable fire,\"[fn-7-P795_192173:68-nf] keeping watch over the omens of their own (future) penalty, in company with the (old) dragon[fn-7-P796_192286:69-nf] himself, are appointed on the ground of virginity. To the Achaean Juno, at the town Aegium, a virgin is allotted; and the (priestesses) who rave at Delphi know not marriage. Moreover, we know that widows minister to the African Ceres; enticed away, indeed, from matrimony by a most stem oblivion: for not only do they withdraw from their still living husbands, but they even introduce other wives to them in their own room-the husbands, of course, smiling on it-all contact (with males), even as far as the kiss of their sons, being forbidden them; and yet, with enduring practice, they persevere in such a discipline of widowhood, which excludes the solace even of holy affection.[fn-7-P797_193009:70-nf] These precepts has the devil given to his servants, and he is heard!

Look how the widow's benefactor is put on a level with the widow herself, whose champion shall \"reason with the Lord!\" Not to virgins, I take it, is so great a gift given. Although in their case perfect integrity and entire sanctity shall have the nearest vision of the face of God, yet the widow has a task more toilsome, because it is easy not to crave after that which you know not, and to turn away from what you have never had to regret.[fn-8-P823_197814:90-nf] More glorious is the continence which is aware of its own right, which knows what it has seen. The virgin may possibly be held the happier, but the widow the more hardly tasked; the former in that she has always kept \"the good,\"[fn-8-P824_198089:91-nf] the latter in that she has found \"the good for herself.\" In the former it is grace, in the latter virtue, that is crowned.
