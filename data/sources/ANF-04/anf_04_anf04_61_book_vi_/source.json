For he has quoted a considerable number of passages, chiefly from Plato, and has placed alongside of these such declarations of holy Scripture as are fitted to impress even the intelligent mind; subjoining the assertion that \"these things are stated much better among the Greeks (than in the Scriptures). and in a manner which is free from all exaggerations[fn-101-P10186_2699202:1-nf] and promises on the part of God, or the Son of God.\" Now we maintain, that if it is the object of the ambassadors of the truth to confer benefits upon the greatest possible number, and, so far as they can, to win over to its side, through their love to men, every one without exception-intelligent as well as simple-not Greeks only, but also Barbarians (and great, indeed, is the humanity which should succeed in converting the rustic and the ignorant[fn-101-P10187_2699670:2-nf] ), it is manifest that they must adopt a style of address fitted to do good to all, and to gain over to them men of every sort.

For our prophets, and Jesus Himself, and His apostles, were careful to adopt[fn-101-P10194_2700738:6-nf] a style of address which should not merely convey the truth, but which should be fitted to gain over the multitude, until each one, attracted and led onwards, should ascend as far as he could towards the comprehension of those mysteries which are contained in these apparently simple words. For, if I may venture to say so, few have been benefited (if they have indeed been benefited at all) by the beautiful and polished style of Plato, and those who have written like him;[fn-101-P10195_2701227:7-nf] while, on the contrary, many have received advantage from those who wrote and taught in a simple and practical manner, and with a view to the wants of the multitude. It is easy, indeed, to observe that Plato is found only in the hands of those who profess to be literary men;[fn-101-P10196_2701597:8-nf] while Epictetus is admired by persons of ordinary capacity, who have a desire to be benefited, and who perceive the improvement which may be derived from his writings. Now we make these remarks, not to disparage Plato (for the great world of men has found even him useful), but to point out the aim of those who said: \"And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, that our faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.\"[fn-101-P10197_2702136:9-nf] For the word of God declares that the preaching (although in itself true and most worthy of belief) is not sufficient to reach the human heart, unless a certain power be imparted to the speaker from God, and a grace appear upon his words; and it is only by the divine agency that this takes place in those who speak effectually. The prophet says in the Psalms 67, that \"the Lord will give a word with great power to them who preach.\"[fn-101-P10198_2702592:10-nf] If, then, it should be granted with respect to certain points, that the same doctrines are found among the Greeks as in our own Scriptures, yet they do not possess the same power of attracting and disposing the souls of men to follow them. And therefore the disciples of Jesus, men ignorant so far as regards Grecian philosophy, yet traversed many countries of the world, impressing, agreeably to the desire of the Logos, each one of their hearers according to his deserts, so that they received a moral amelioration in proportion to the inclination of their will to accept of that which is good.","index":"86","references":[{"fn":"101","code":"P10194_2700738","folder":"ANF-04","text":"e0nei=don.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"101","code":"P10195_2701227","folder":"ANF-04","text":"See Dr. Burton's Bampton Lectures On the Heresies of the Apostolic Age, pp. 198, 529.

Suppose that Plato, for example, the son of Ariston, in one of his Epistles, is discoursing about the \"chief good,\" and that he says, \"The chief good can by no means be described in words, but is produced by long habit, and bursts forth suddenly as a light in the soul, as from a fire which had leapt forth.\" We, then, on hearing these words, admit that they are well said, for it is God who revealed to men these as well as all other noble expressions. And for this reason it is that we maintain that those who have entertained correct ideas regarding God, but who have not offered to Him a worship in harmony with the truth, are liable to the punishments which fall on sinners. For respecting such Paul says in express words: \"The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath showed it unto them. For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: because that, when they knew God, they glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.

For how was it possible that they should have heard one who was not yet born? And if any one should apply the words of Celsus to the apostles of Jesus, who were younger than Plato, say whether it is not on the very face of it an incredible assertion, that Paul the tentmaker, and Peter the fisherman, and John who left his father's nets, should, through misunderstanding the language of Plato in his Epistles, have expressed themselves as they have done regarding God?

Such persons will deride as a fiction even the demon of Socrates. We do not, then, relate marvels when we narrate the history of Jesus, nor have His genuine disciples recorded any such stories of Him; whereas this Celsus, who professes universal knowledge, and who quotes many of the sayings of Plato, is, I think, intentionally silent on the discourse concerning the Son of God which is related in Plato's Epistle to Hermeas and Coriscus. Plato's words are as follows: \"And calling to witness the God of all things-the ruler both of things present and things to come, father and lord both of the ruler and cause-whom, if we are philosophers indeed, we shall all clearly know, so far as it is possible for happy human beings to attain such knowledge.\"[fn-102-P10250_2719573:44-nf] ","index":"98","references":[{"fn":"102","code":"P10247_2716931","folder":"ANF-04","text":"ou0 terateu/etai.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"102","code":"P10248_2718164","folder":"ANF-04","text":"The night before Ariston brought Plato to Socrates as his pupil, the latter dreamed that a swan from the altar of Cupid alighted on his bosom.

And if any one will defend such language on account of the meaning which is conveyed under the name of Zeus, thus speaking in the dialogue of Plato, why should not he who investigates the meaning of the words of the Son of God, or those of the Creator ([fn-102-P10263_2723009:51-nf] in the prophets, express a profounder meaning than any conveyed by the words of Zeus in the Timaeus? For the characteristic of divinity is the announcement of future events, predicted not by human power, but shown by the result to be due to a divine spirit in him who made the announcement. Accordingly, we do not say to each of our hearers, \"Believe, first of all, that He whom I introduce to thee is the Son of God; \"but we put the Gospel before each one, as his character and disposition may fit him to receive it, inasmuch as we have learned to know \"how we ought to answer every man.\"[fn-102-P10264_2723622:52-nf] And there are some who are capable of receiving nothing more than an exhortation to believe, and to these we address that alone; while we approach others, again, as far as possible, in the way of demonstration, by means of question and answer.

If it had been recorded that several individuals had appeared in human life as sons of God in the manner in which Jesus did, and if each of them had drawn a party of adherents to his side, so that, on account of the similarity of the profession (in the case of each individual) that he was the Son of God, he to whom his followers bore testimony to that effect was an object of dispute, there would have been ground for his saying, \"If these bring forward this person, and others a different individual, while the common and ready cry of all parties is, `Believe, if thou wilt be saved, or else begone, '\" and so on; whereas it has been proclaimed to the entire world that Jesus Christ is the only Son of God who visited the human race: for those who, like Celsus, have supposed that (the acts of Jesus) were a series of prodigies,[fn-102-P10270_2725816:55-nf] and who for that reason wished to perform acts of the same kind,[fn-102-P10271_2726221:56-nf] that they, too, might gain a similar mastery over the minds of men, were convicted of being utter nonentities.[fn-102-P10272_2726353:57-nf] Such were Simon, the Magus of Samaria, and Dositheus, who was a native of the same place; since the former gave out that he was the power of God that is called great,[fn-102-P10273_2726538:58-nf] and the latter that he was the Son of God. Now Simonians are found nowhere throughout the world; and yet, in order to gain over to himself many followers, Simon freed his disciples from the danger of death, which the Christians were taught to prefer, by teaching them to regard idolatry as a matter of indifference. But even at the beginning of their existence the followers of Simon were not exposed to persecution. For that wicked demon who was conspiring against the doctrine of Jesus, was well aware that none of his own maxims would be weakened by the teaching of Simon. The Dositheans, again, even in former times, did not rise to any eminence, and now they are completely extinguished, so that it is said their whole number does not amount to thirty. Judas of Galilee also, as Luke relates in the Acts of the Apostles,[fn-102-P10274_2727422:59-nf] wished to call himself some great personage, as did Theudas before him; but as their doctrine was not of God, they were destroyed, and all who obeyed them were immediately dispersed.

It is not our purpose at present, however, to speak of those who acknowledge another god than the one worshipped by the Jews, but to defend ourselves, and to show that it was impossible for the prophets of the Jews, whose writings are reckoned among ours, to have borrowed anything from Plato, because they were older than he.

For in the latter there is a representation of the two heavenly revolutions,-of the movement, viz., of the fixed[fn-103-P10366_2752810:118-nf] stars, and of that which take place among the planets, and of the passage of the soul through these. The representation is of the following nature: There is a ladder with lofty gates,[fn-103-P10367_2753021:119-nf] and on the top of it an eighth gate. The first gate consists of lead, the second of tin, the third of copper, the fourth of iron, the fifth of a mixture of metals,[fn-103-P10368_2753247:120-nf] the sixth of silver, and the seventh of gold. The first gate they assign to Saturn, indicating by the 'lead' the slowness of this star; the second to Venus, comparing her to the splendour and softness of tin; the third to Jupiter, being firm[fn-103-P10369_2753519:121-nf] and solid; the fourth to Mercury, for both Mercury and iron are fit to endure all things, and are money-making and laborious;[fn-103-P10370_2753686:122-nf] the fifth to Mars, because, being composed of a mixture of metals, it is varied and unequal; the sixth, of silver, to the Moon; the seventh, of gold, to the Sun,-thus imitating the different colours of the two latter.\" He next proceeds to examine the reason of the stars being arranged in this order, which is symbolized by the names of the rest of matter.[fn-103-P10371_2754162:123-nf] Musical reasons, moreover, are added or quoted by the Persian theology; and to these, again, he strives to add a second explanation, connected also with musical considerations. But it seems to me, that to quote the language of Celsus upon these matters would be absurd, and similar to what he himself has done, when, in his accusations against Christians and Jews, he quoted, most inappropriately, not only the words of Plato; but, dissatisfied even with these,[fn-103-P10372_2754689:124-nf] he adduced in addition the mysteries of the Persian Mithras, and the explanation of them.

In the next place, they are taught to say as follows, while passing through what they call Ialdabaoth: \"Thou, O first and seventh, who art born to command with confidence, thou, O Ialdabaoth, who art the rational ruler of a pure mind, and a perfect work to son and father, bearing the symbol of life in the character of a type, and opening to the world the gate which thou didst close against thy kingdom, I pass again in freedom through thy realm.

It is certain, then, that there will be diversities amongst the hearts of men,-those which are inclined to virtue not being all modelled and shaped towards it in the same or like degree; while others, through neglect of virtue, rash to the opposite extreme. And amongst the latter are some in whom evil is deeply engrained, and others in whom it is less deeply rooted.

For God, comprehending all things by means of His foreknowledge, and foreseeing what consequences would result from both of these, wished to make these known to mankind by His prophets, that those who understand their words might be familiarized with the good, and be on their guard against its opposite.

I am well aware that those who would daringly assert that these evils were created by God will quote certain expressions of Scripture (in their support), because we are not able to show one consistent series[fn-106-P10636_2836565:279-nf] of passages; for although Scripture (generally) blames the wicked and approves of the righteous, it nevertheless contains some statements which, although comparatively[fn-106-P10637_2836747:280-nf] few in number, seem to disturb the minds of ignorant readers of holy Scripture. I have not,however, deemed it appropriate to my present treatise to quote on the present occasion those discordant statements, which are many in number,[fn-106-P10638_2837075:281-nf] and their explanations, which would require a long array of proofs. Evils, then, if those be meant which are properly so called, were not created by God; but some, although few in comparison with the order of the whole world, have resulted from His principal works, as there follow from the chief works of the carpenter such things as spiral shavings and sawdust,[fn-106-P10639_2837469:282-nf] or as architects might appear to be the cause of the rubbish[fn-106-P10640_2837578:283-nf] which lies around their buildings in the form of the filth which drops from the stones and the plaster.","index":"202","references":[{"fn":"106","code":"P10631_2834638","folder":"ANF-04","text":"kataxrhstikw/teron.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"106","code":"P10632_2834921","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Cf.

Any one might answer the charge that God is incapable of admonishing men; for He conveys His admonitions throughout the whole of Scripture, and by means of those persons who, through God's gracious appointment, are the instructors of His hearers. Unless, indeed, some peculiar meaning be understood to attach to the word \"admonish,\" as if it signified both to penetrate into the mind of the person admonished, and to make him hear the words of his[fn-106-P10652_2840292:289-nf] instructor, which is contrary to the usual meaning of the word. To the objection, \"How is he incapable of persuading? \"-which also might be brought against all who believe in providence,-we have to make the following remarks. Since the expression \"to be persuaded\" belongs to those words which are termed, so to speak, \"reciprocal\"[fn-106-P10653_2840725:290-nf] (compare the phrase \"to shave a man,\" when he makes an effort to submit himself to the barber[fn-106-P10654_2840879:291-nf] , there is for this reason needed not merely the effort of him who persuades, but also the submission, so to speak, which is to be yielded to the persuader, or the acceptance of what is said by him. And therefore it must not be said that it is because God is incapable of persuading men that they are not persuaded, but because they will not accept the faithful words of God. And if one were to apply this expression to men who are the \"artificers of persuasion,\"[fn-106-P10655_2841439:292-nf] he would not be wrong; for it is possible for a man who has thoroughly learned the principles of rhetoric, and who employs them properly, to do his utmost to persuade, and yet appear to fail, because he cannot overcome the will of him who ought to yield to his persuasive arts. Moreover, that persuasion does not come from God, although persuasive words may be uttered by him, is distinctly taught by Paul, when he says: \"This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.\"[fn-106-P10656_2841943:293-nf] Such also is the view indicated by these words: \"If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land; but if ye refuse and rebel, a sword shall devour you.\"[fn-106-P10657_2842135:294-nf] For that one may (really) desire what is addressed to him by one who admonishes, and may become deserving of those promises of God which he hears, it is necessary to secure the will of the hearer, and his inclination to what is addressed to him. And therefore it appears to me, that in the book of Deuteronomy the following words are uttered with peculiar emphasis: \"And now, O Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, and to walk in all His ways, and to love Him, and to keep His commandments? \"[fn-106-P10658_2842701:295-nf] ","index":"206","references":[{"fn":"106","code":"P10652_2840292","folder":"ANF-04","text":"to\\ kai\\ e0pitugxa/nein e0n tw=| nouqetoume/nw| kai\\ a0kou/ein to\\n tou= dida/skontoj lo/gon.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"106","code":"P10653_2840725","folder":"ANF-04","text":"w9sperei\\ tw=n kaloume/nwn a0ntipeponqo/twn e0sti/n.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"106","code":"P10654_2840879","folder":"ANF-04","text":"a0na/logon tw= kei/resqai a!nqrwpon, e0nergou=nta to\\ pare/xein e9auto\\n tw=| kei/ronti.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"106","code":"P10655_2841439","folder":"ANF-04","text":"perqou=j dhmiourgw=n.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"106","code":"P10656_2841943","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Cf.

We stated, indeed, in what precedes, that it was not as if awakening from a lengthened slumber that God sent Jesus to the human race, who has now, for good reasons, fulfilled the economy of His incarnation, but who has always conferred benefits upon the human race.

Moreover, the advent of Jesus apparently to one corner (of the earth) was founded on good reasons, since it was necessary that He who was the subject of prophecy should make His appearance among those who had become acquainted with the doctrine of one God, and who perused the writings of His prophets, and who had come to know the announcement of Christ, and that He should come to them at a time when the Word was about to be diffused from one corner over the whole world.","index":"248","references":[]}]},{"name":"Chapter LXXIX.","index":80,"paragraphs":[{"text":"And therefore there was no need that there should everywhere exist many bodies, and many spirits like Jesus, in order that the whole world of men might be enlightened by the Word of God.

But if any one desires to see many bodies filled with a divine Spirit, similar to the one Christ, ministering to the salvation of men everywhere, let him take note of those who teach the Gospel of Jesus in all lands in soundness of doctrine and uprightness of life, and who are themselves termed \"christs\" by the holy Scriptures, in the passage, \"Touch not Mine anointed,[fn-108-P10825_2892644:396-nf] and do not My prophets any harm.\"[fn-108-P10826_2892704:397-nf] For as we have heard that Antichrist cometh, and yet have learned that there are many antichrists in the world, in the same way, knowing that Christ has come, we see that, owing to Him, there are many christs in the world, who, like Him, have loved righteousness and hated iniquity, and therefore God, the God of Christ, anointed them also with the \"oil of gladness.\" But inasmuch as He loved righteousness and hated iniquity above those who were His partners,[fn-108-P10827_2893209:398-nf] He also obtained the first-fruits of His anointing, and, if we must so term it, the entire unction of the oil of gladness; while they who were His partners shared also in His unction, in proportion to their individual capacity.

There is therefore nothing ridiculous in the Son of God having been sent to the Jews, amongst whom the prophets had appeared, in order that, making a commencement among them in a bodily shape, He might arise with might and power upon a world of souls, which no longer desired to remain deserted by God.","index":"250","references":[{"fn":"108","code":"P10825_2892644","folder":"ANF-04","text":"tw=n xristw=n mou.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"108","code":"P10826_2892704","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Cf. 1 Chron. xvi. 22 and Ps. cv. 15.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 chronicles","chapter":16,"verses":[22]},{"book":"psalms","chapter":105,"verses":[15]}]},{"fn":"108","code":"P10827_2893209","folder":"ANF-04","text":"tou\\j meto/xouj kri/seij.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"108","code":"P10828_2894316","folder":"ANF-04","text":"dusdihgh/touj ta\\j kri/seij.","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter LXXX.","index":81,"paragraphs":[{"text":"After this, it seemed proper to Celsus to term the Chaldeans a most divinely-inspired nation from the very earliest times,[fn-108-P10832_2894877:400-nf] from whom the delusive system of astrology[fn-108-P10833_2894940:401-nf] has spread abroad among men. Nay, he ranks the Magi also in the same category, from whom the art of magic derived its name and has been transmitted to other nations, to the corruption and destruction of those who employ it. In the preceding part of this work, (we mentioned) that, in the opinion even of Celsus, the Egyptians also were guilty of error, because they had indeed solemn enclosures around what they considered their temples, while within them there was nothing save apes, or crocodiles, or goats, or asps, or some other animal; but on the present occasion it pleases him to speak of the Egyptian people too as most divinely inspired, and that, too, from the earliest times,-perhaps because they made war upon the Jews from an early date. The Persians, moreover, who marry their own mothers,[fn-108-P10834_2895768:402-nf] and have intercourse with their own daughters, are, in the opinion of Celsus, an inspired race; nay, even. the Indians are so, some of whom, in the preceding, he mentioned as eaters of human flesh. To the Jews, however, especially those of ancient times, who employ none of these practices, he did not merely refuse the name of inspired, but declared that they would immediately perish. And this prediction he uttered respecting them, as being doubtless endued with prophetic power, not observing that the whole history of the Jews, and their ancient and venerable polity, were administered by God; and that it is by their fall that salvation has come to the Gentiles, and that \"their fall is the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles,\"[fn-108-P10835_2896615:403-nf] until the fulness of the Gentiles come, that after that the whole of Israel, whom Celsus does not know, may be saved.","index":"252","references":[{"fn":"108","code":"P10832_2894877","folder":"ANF-04","text":"e0c a0rxh=j.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"108","code":"P10833_2894940","folder":"ANF-04","text":"geneqlialogi/a.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"108","code":"P10834_2895768","folder":"ANF-04","text":"On the manners of heathen nations, note this.
