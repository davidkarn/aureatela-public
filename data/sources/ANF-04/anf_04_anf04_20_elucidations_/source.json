But surely it might be objected even more plausibly against \"the Shepherd,\" whom he prefers, in common with all Christians, as see John 8:1-11, which I take to be canonical Scripture. A curious question is suggested by what he says of the figure of the Good Shepherd portrayed on the chalice: Is this irony, as if the figure so familiar from illustrations of the catacombs must be meant for the Shepherd of Hermas? Regarding all pictures as idolatrous, he may intend to intimate that adultery (=idolatry) was thus symbolized.","index":"8","references":[{"fn":"16","code":"P1681_495591","folder":"ANF-04","text":"On Prayer, vol. iii. cap. xvi. p. 686, supra, where he speaks respectfully.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"16","code":"P1682_495714","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Vol. ii. p. 22 (also p. 43), this series.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"\nII","index":"9","references":[]},{"text":"Clasping the knees of all, p. 86.","index":"10","references":[]},{"text":"Here is a portrait of the early penitential discipline sufficiently terrible, and it conforms to the apostolic pictures of the same. \"Tell it unto the Church,\" says our Lord (Matt. xviii. 17).

St. Chrysostom, however, reflecting the discipline of his day, in which great changes were made, says, on Matthew 18:17, unless it be a gloss, \"Dic Ecclesuoeid est Proesidibus = pr\\oelig\\dreuou/sin.\" (Tom. vii. p. 536, ed.
