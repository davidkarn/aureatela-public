Endearing associations have clung to it from the mention of this apostolic cloak in Holy Scripture. It doubtless influenced Justin in giving his philosopher's gown a new significance, and the modern Greeks insist that such was the apparel of the apostles. The seamless robe of Christ Himself belongs to Him only.","index":"7","references":[{"fn":"2","code":"P244_49080","folder":"ANF-04","text":"See vol. i. p. 160, this series.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"Tertullian rarely acknowledges his obligations to other Doctors; but Justin's example and St. Paul's cloak must have been in his thoughts when he rejected the toga, and claimed the pallium, as a Christian's attire. Our Edinburgh translator has assumed that it was the \"ascetics' mantle,\" and perhaps it was.[fn-2-P246_49899:76-nf] Our author wished to make all Christians ascetics, like himself, and hence his enthusiasm for a distinctive costume. Anyhow, \"the Doctor's gown\" of the English universities, which is also used among the Gallicans and in Savoy, is one of the most ancient as well as dignified vestments in ecclesiastical use; and for the prophetic or preaching function of the clergy it is singularly appropriate.[fn-2-P247_50431:77-nf] ","index":"8","references":[{"fn":"2","code":"P246_49899","folder":"ANF-04","text":"But it was assuming a questionable point (See Kaye, p. 49) to give it this name in the title, and I have retained it untranslated.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"2","code":"P247_50431","folder":"ANF-04","text":"See note on p. 160 of vol. i., this series.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"\"The pallium,\" says a learned author,[fn-2-P249_50518:78-nf] the late Wharton B.

It corresponded in general use to the Roman toga, but in the earlier Roman language, that of republican times, was as distinctively suggestive of a Greek costume as the toga of that of Rome.\" To Tertullian, therefore, his preference for the pallium was doubtless commended by all these considerations; and the distinctively Greek character of Christian theology was indicated also by his choice. He loved the learning of Alexandria, and reflected the spirit of the East.","index":"9","references":[{"fn":"2","code":"P249_50518","folder":"ANF-04","text":"See his valuable and exhaustive treatise, the Vestiarium Christianum, especially pp. 73, 125, 233, 490.
