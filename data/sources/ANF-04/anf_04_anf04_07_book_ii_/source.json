Modesty to Be Observed Not Only in Its Essence, But in Its Accessories.","index":2,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Handmaids of the living God, my fellow-servants and sisters, the right which I enjoy with you-I, the most meanest[fn-3-P355_73362:1-nf] in that right of fellow-servantship and brotherhood-emboldens me to address to you a discourse, not, of course, of affection, but paving the way for affection in the cause of your salvation. That salvation-and not (the salvation) of women only, but likewise of men-consists in the exhibition principally of modesty. For since, by the introduction into an appropriation[fn-3-P356_73750:2-nf] (in) us of the Holy Spirit, we are all\" the temple of God,\"[fn-3-P357_73825:3-nf] Modesty is the sacristan and priestess of that temple, who is to suffer nothing unclean or profane to be introduced (into it), for fear that the God who inhabits it should be offended, and quite forsake the polluted abode. But on the present occasion we (are to speak) not about modesty, for the enjoining and exacting of which the divine precepts which press (upon us) on every side are sufficient; but about the matters which pertain to it, that is, the manner in which it behoves you to walk. For most women (which very thing I trust God may permit me, with a view, of course, to my own personal censure, to censure in all), either from simple ignorance or else from dissimulation, have the hardihood so to walk as if modesty consisted only[fn-3-P358_74608:4-nf] in the (bare) integrity of the flesh, and in turning away from (actual) fornication; and there were no need for anything extrinsic to boot-in the matter (I mean) of the arrangement of dress and ornament,[fn-3-P359_74838:5-nf] the studied graces of form and brilliance:-wearing in their gait the self-same appearance as the women of the nations, from whom the sense of true modesty is absent, because in those who know not God, the Guardian and Master of truth, there is nothing true.[fn-3-P360_75169:6-nf] For if any modesty can be believed (to exist) in Gentiles, it is plain that it must be imperfect and undisciplined to such a degree that, although it be actively tenacious of itself in the mind up to a certain point, it yet allows itself to relax into licentious extravagances of attire; just in accordance with Gentile perversity, in craving after that of which it carefully shuns the effect.[fn-3-P361_75588:7-nf] How many a one, in short, is there who does not earnestly desire even to look pleasing to strangers? who does not on that very account take care to have herself painted out, and denies that she has (ever) been an object of (carnal) appetite? And yet, granting that even this is a practice familiar to Gentile modesty-(namely, ) not actually to commit the sin, but still to be willing to do so; or even not to be willing, yet still not quite to refuse-what wonder? for all things which are not God's are perverse. Let those women therefore look to it, who, by not holding fast the whole good, easily mingle with evil even what they do hold fast. Necessary it is that you turn aside from them, as in all other things, so also in your gait; since you ought to be \"perfect, as (is) your Father who is in the heavens.\"[fn-3-P362_76423:8-nf] ","index":"16","references":[{"fn":"3","code":"P355_73362","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Postremissimus.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"3","code":"P356_73750","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Consecrato.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"3","code":"P357_73825","folder":"ANF-04","text":"See 1 Cor. iii. 16, 17, vi. 19, 20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":3,"verses":[16]}]},{"fn":"3","code":"P358_74608","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Comp. de Idol., c. ii.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"3","code":"P359_74838","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Cultus et ornatus.

Difference Between Trust and Presumption. If Secure Ourselves, We Must Not Put Temptation in the Way of Others. We Must Love Our Neighbour as Ourself.","index":3,"paragraphs":[{"text":"You must know that in the eye of perfect, that is, Christian, modesty, (carnal) desire of one's self (on the part of others) is not only not to be desired, but even execrated, by you: first, because the study of making personal grace (which we know to be naturally the inviter of lust) a mean of pleasing does not spring from a sound conscience: why therefore excite toward yourself that evil (passion)? why invite (that) to which you profess yourself a stranger? secondly, because we ought not to open a way to temptations, which, by their instancy, sometimes achieve (a wickedness) which God expels from them who are His; (or, ) at all events, put the spirit into a thorough tumult by (presenting) a stumbling-block (to it). We ought indeed to walk so holily, and with so entire substantiality[fn-3-P366_77486:9-nf] of faith, as to be confident and secure in regard of our own conscience, desiring that that (gift) may abide in us to the end, yet not presuming (that it will). For he who presumes feels less apprehension; he who feels less apprehension takes less precaution; he who takes less precaution runs more risk. Fear[fn-3-P367_77874:10-nf] is the foundation of salvation; presumption is an impediment to fear. More useful, then, is it to apprehend that we may possibly fail, than to presume that we cannot; for apprehending will lead us to fear, fearing to caution, and caution to salvation. On the other hand, if we presume, there will be neither fear nor caution to save us. He who acts securely, and not at the same time warily, possesses no safe and firm security; whereas he who is wary will be truly able to be secure. For His own servants, may the Lord by His mercy take care that to them it may be lawful even to presume on His goodness! But why are we a (source of) danger to our neighbour? why do we import concupiscence into our neighbour? which concupiscence, if God, in \"amplifying the law,\"[fn-3-P368_78651:11-nf] do not[fn-3-P369_78753:12-nf] dissociate in (the way of) penalty from the actual commission of fornication,[fn-3-P370_78901:13-nf] I know not whether He allows impunity to him who[fn-3-P371_79024:14-nf] has been the cause of perdition to some other. For that other, as soon as he has felt concupiscence after your beauty, and has mentally already committed (the deed) which his concupiscence pointed to,[fn-3-P372_79258:15-nf] perishes; and you have been made[fn-3-P373_79334:16-nf] the sword which destroys him: so that, albeit you be free from the (actual) crime, you are not free from the odium (attaching to it); as, when a robbery has been committed on some man's estate, the (actual) crime indeed will not be laid to the owner's charge, while yet the domain is branded with ignominy, (and) the owner himself aspersed with the infamy. Are we to paint ourselves out that our neighbours may perish? Where, then, is (the command), \"Thou shall love thy neighbour as thyself? \"[fn-3-P374_79847:17-nf] \"Care not merely about your own (things), but (about your) neighbour's? \"[fn-3-P375_80029:18-nf] No enunciation of the Holy Spirit ought to be (confined) to the subject immediately in hand merely, and not applied and carried out with a view to every occasion to which its application is useful.[fn-3-P376_80274:19-nf] Since, therefore, both our own interest and that of others is implicated in the studious pursuit of most perilous (outward) comeliness, it is time for you to know[fn-3-P377_80462:20-nf] that not merely must the pageantry of fictitious and elaborate beauty be rejected by you; but that of even natural grace must be obliterated by concealment and negligence, as equally dangerous to the glances of (the beholder's) eyes.

For, where modesty is, there beauty is idle; because properly the use and fruit of beauty is voluptuousness, unless any one thinks that there is some other harvest for bodily grace to reap.[fn-3-P390_82116:30-nf] Are women who think that, in furnishing to their neighbour that which is demanded of beauty, they are furnishing it to themselves also, to augment that (beauty) when (naturally) given them, and to strive after it when not (thus) given?

But how much more provocative of blasphemy is it that you, who are called modesty's priestesses, should appear in public decked and painted out after the manner of the immodest? Else, (if you so do,) what inferiority would the poor unhappy victims of the public lusts have (beneath you)? whom, albeit some laws were (formerly) wont to restrain them from (the use of) matrimonial and matronly decorations, now, at all events, the daily increasing depravity of the age[fn-5-P508_105877:120-nf] has raised so nearly to an equality with all the most honourable women, that the difficulty is to distinguish them. And yet, even the Scriptures suggest (to us the reflection), that meretricious attractivenesses of form are invariably conjoined with and appropriate[fn-5-P509_106159:121-nf] to bodily prostitution. That powerful state[fn-5-P510_106218:122-nf] which presides over[fn-5-P511_106257:123-nf] the seven mountains and very many waters, has merited from the Lord the appellation of a prostitute.[fn-5-P512_106391:124-nf] But what kind of garb is the instrumental mean of her comparison with that appellation? She sits, to be sure, \"in purple, and scarlet, and gold, and precious stone.\" How accursed are the things without (the aid of) which an accursed prostitute could not have been described! It was the fact that Thamar \"had painted out and adorned herself\" that led Judah to regard her as a harlot,[fn-5-P513_106798:125-nf] and thus, because she was hidden beneath her \"veil,\"-the quality of her garb belying her as if she had been a harlot,-he judged (her to be one), and addressed and bargained with (her as such). Whence we gather an additional confirmation of the lesson, that provision must be made in every way. against all immodest associations[fn-5-P514_107161:126-nf] and suspicions. For why is the integrity of a chaste mind defiled by its neighbour's suspicion? Why is a thing from which I am averse hoped for in me? Why does not my garb pre-announce my character, to prevent my spirit from being wounded by shamelessness through (the channel of) nay ears?

Especially in These Times of Persecution We Must Inure Our Bodies to the Hardships Which They May Not Improbably Be Called to Suffer.","index":14,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Perhaps some (woman) will say: \"To me it is not necessary to be approved by men; for I do not require the testimony of men:[fn-5-P519_107969:128-nf] God is the inspector of the heart.\"[fn-5-P520_108044:129-nf] (That) we all know; provided, however, we remember what the same (God) has said through the apostle: \"Let your probity appear before men.\"[fn-5-P521_108240:130-nf] For what purpose, except that malice may have no access at all to you, or that you may be an example and testimony to the evil? Else, what is (that): \"Let your works shine? \"[fn-5-P522_108473:131-nf] Why, moreover, does the Lord call us the light of the world; why has He compared us to a city built upon a mountain;[fn-5-P523_108650:132-nf] if we do not shine in (the midst of) darkness, and stand eminent amid them who are sunk down? If you hide your lamp beneath a bushel,[fn-5-P524_108804:133-nf] you must necessarily be left quite in darkness, and be run against by many. The things which make us luminaries of the world are these-our good works. What is good, moreover, provided it be true and full, loves not darkness: it joys in being seen,[fn-5-P525_109108:134-nf] and exults over the very pointings which are made at it. To Christian modesty it is not enough to be so, but to seem so too. For so great ought its plenitude to be, that it may flow out from the mind to the garb, and burst out from the conscience to the outward appearance; so that even from the outside it may gaze, as it were, upon its own furniture,[fn-5-P526_109486:135-nf] -(a furniture) such as to be suited to retain faith as its inmate perpetually. For such delicacies as tend by their softness and effeminacy to unman the manliness[fn-5-P527_109671:136-nf] of faith are to be discarded. Otherwise, I know not whether the wrist that has been wont to be surrounded with the palmleaf-like bracelet will endure till it grow into the numb hardness of its own chain! I know not whether the leg that has rejoiced in the anklet will suffer itself to be squeezed into the gyve! I fear the neck, beset with pearl and emerald nooses, will give no room to the broadsword! Wherefore, blessed (sisters), let us meditate on hardships, and we shall not feel them; let us abandon luxuries, and we shall not regret them. Let us stand ready to endure every violence, having nothing which we may fear to leave behind. It is these things which are the bonds which retard our hope. Let us cast away earthly ornaments if we desire heavenly. Love not gold; in which (one substance) are branded all the sins of the people of Israel. You ought to hate what mined your fathers; what was adored by them who were forsaking God.[fn-5-P528_110639:137-nf] Even then (we find) gold is food for the fire.[fn-5-P529_110710:138-nf] But Christians always, and now more than ever, pass their times not in gold but in iron: the stoles of martyrdom are (now) preparing: the angels who are to carry us are (now) being awaited! Do you go forth (to meet them) already arrayed in the cosmetics and ornaments of prophets and apostles; drawing your whiteness from simplicity, your ruddy hue from modesty; painting your eyes with bashfulness, and your mouth with silence; implanting in your ears the words of God; fitting on your necks the yoke of Christ. Submit your head to your husbands, and you will be enough adorned. Busy your hands with spinning; keep your feet at home; and you will \"please\" better than (by arraying yourselves) in gold. Clothe yourselves with the silk of uprightness, the fine linen of holiness, the purple of modesty. Thus painted, you will have God as your Lover!
