I Have often been astonished at your feeling towards me as you do, and how it comes about that an individual so small and insignificant, and having, may be, very little that is lovable about him, should have so won your allegiance. You remind me of the claims of friendship and of fatherland,[fn-26-P2652_891220:2-nf] and press me urgently in your attempt to make me come back to you, as though I were a runaway from a father's heart and home. That I am a runaway I confess. I should be sorry to deny it; since you are already regretting me, you shall be told the cause. I was astounded like a man stunned by some sudden noise. I did not crush my thoughts, but dwelt upon them as I fled, and now I have been absent from you a considerable time. Then I began to yearn for the divine doctrines, and the philosophy that is concerned with them. How, said I, could I overcome the mischief dwelling with us? Who is to be my Laban, setting me free from Esau, and leading me to the supreme philosophy? By God's help, I have, so far as in me lies, attained my object; I have found a chosen vessel, a deep well; I mean Gregory, Christ's mouth. Give me, therefore, I beg you, a little time. I am not embracing a city life.[fn-26-P2653_892236:3-nf] I am quite well aware how the evil one by such means devises deceit for mankind, but I do hold the society of the saints most useful. For in the more constant change of ideas about the divine dogmas I am acquiring a lasting habit of contemplation. Such is my present situation.","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"26","code":"P2652_891220","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"patri/j seems to be used of the city or neighbourhood of Caesarea, and so far to be in favour of Basil's birth there.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"26","code":"P2653_892236","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"i.e. the life of the city, presumably Nazianzus, from which he is writing.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"2. Friends godly and well beloved, do, I implore you, beware of the shepherds of the Philistines; let them not choke your wills unawares; let them not befoul the purity of your knowledge of the faith. This is ever their object, not to teach simple souls lessons drawn from Holy Scripture, but to mar the harmony of the truth by heathen philosophy. Is not he an open Philistine who is introducing the terms \"unbegotten\" and \"begotten\" into our faith, and asserts that there was once a time when the Everlasting was not;[fn-26-P2655_893110:4-nf] that He who is by nature and eternally a Father became a Father; that the Holy Ghost is not eternal? He bewitches our Patriarch's sheep that they may not drink \"of the well of water springing upeverlasting life,\"[fn-26-P2656_893373:5-nf] but may rather bring upon themselves the words of the prophet, \"They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water;\"[fn-26-P2657_893578:6-nf] when all the while they ought to confess that the Father is God, the Son God, and the Holy Ghost God,[fn-26-P2658_893696:7-nf] as they have been taught by the divine words, and by those who have understood them in their highest sense. Against those who cast it in our teeth that we are Tritheists, let it be answered that we confess one God not in number but in nature. For everything which is called one in number is not one absolutely, nor yet simple in nature; but God is universally confessed to be simple and not composite. God therefore is not one in number. What I mean is this. We say that the world is one in number, but not one by nature nor yet simple; for we divide it into its constituent elements, fire, water, air, and earth.[fn-26-P2659_894419:8-nf] Again, man is called one in number. We frequently speak of one man, but man who is composed of body and soul is not simple. Similarly we say one angel in number, but not one by nature nor yet simple, for we conceive of the hypostasis of the angel as essence with sanctification. If therefore everything which is one in number is not one in nature, and that which is one and simple in nature is not one in number; and if we call God one in nature how can number be charged against us, when we utterly exclude it from that blessed and spiritual nature? Number relates to quantity; and quantity is conjoined with bodily nature, for number is of bodily nature. We believe our Lord to be Creator of bodies. Wherefore every number indicates those things which have received a material and circumscribed nature. Monad and Unity on the other hand signify the nature which is simple and incomprehensible. Whoever therefore confesses either the Son of God or the Holy Ghost to be number or creature introduces unawares a material and circumscribed nature. And by circumscribed I mean not only locally limited, but a nature which is comprehended in foreknowledge by Him who is about to educe it from the non-existent into the existent and which can be comprehended by science. Every holy thing then of which the nature is circumscribed and of which the holiness is acquired is not insusceptible of evil. But the Son and the Holy Ghost are the source of sanctification by which every reasonable creature is hallowed in proportion to its virtue.","index":"4","references":[{"fn":"26","code":"P2655_893110","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"cf. the Arian formula h\\n pote\\ o#te ou'k h\\n.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"26","code":"P2656_893373","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"John iv. 14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":4,"verses":[14]}]},{"fn":"26","code":"P2657_893578","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"Jer. ii. 13.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"26","code":"P2658_893696","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"cf. p. 16, note.

We in accordance with the true doctrine speak of the Son as neither like,[fn-26-P2661_896588:9-nf] nor unlike[fn-26-P2662_896638:10-nf] the Father. Each of these terms is equally impossible, for like and unlike are predicated in relation to quality, and the divine is free from quality. We, on the contrary, confess identity of nature and accepting the consubstantiality, and rejecting the composition of the Father, God in substance, Who begat the Son, God in substance. From this the consubstantiality[fn-26-P2663_897082:11-nf] is proved. For God in essence or substance is co-essential or con-substantial with God in essence or substance. But when even man is called \"god\" as in the words, \"I have said ye are gods,\"[fn-26-P2664_897294:12-nf] and \"daemon\" as in the words, \"The gods of the nations are daemons,\"[fn-26-P2665_897383:13-nf] in the former case the name is given by favour, in the latter untruly. God alone is substantially and essentially God. When I say \"alone\" I set forth the holy and uncreated essence and substance of God. For the word \"alone\" is used in the case of any individual and generally of human nature. In the case of an individual, as for instance of Paul, that he alone was caught into the third heaven and \"heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter,\"[fn-26-P2666_897874:14-nf] and of human nature, as when David says, \"as for man his days are as grass,\"[fn-26-P2667_897971:15-nf] not meaning any particular man, but human nature generally; for every man is short-lived and mortal. So we understand these words to be said of the nature, \"who alone hath immortality\"[fn-26-P2668_898174:16-nf] and \"to God only wise,\"[fn-26-P2669_898218:17-nf] and \"none is good save one, that is God,\"[fn-26-P2670_898279:18-nf] for here \"one\" means the same as alone. So also, \"which alone spreadest out the heavens,\"[fn-26-P2671_898390:19-nf] and again \"Thou shall worship the Lord thy God and Him only shalt thou serve.\"[fn-26-P2672_898486:20-nf] \"There is no God beside me.\"[fn-26-P2673_898690:21-nf] In Scripture \"one\" and \"only\" are not predicated of God to mark distinction from the Son and the Holy Ghost, but to except the unreal gods falsely so called.As for instance, \"The Lord alone did lead them and there was no strange god with them,\"[fn-26-P2674_898962:22-nf] and \"then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and didserve the Lord only.\"[fn-26-P2675_899086:23-nf] And so St. Paul, \"For as there be gods many and lords many, but to us there is but out god, the Father, of whom are all things; and one Lord Jesus Christ by Whom are all things.\"[fn-26-P2676_899285:24-nf] Here we enquire why when he had said \"one God\" he was not content, for we have said that \"one\" and \"only\" when applied to God, indicate nature. Why did he add the word Father and make mention of Christ? Paul, a chosen vessel, did not, I imagine, think it sufficient only to preach that the Son is God and the Holy Ghost God, which he had expressed by the phrase \"one God.\" without, by the further addition of \"the Father,\" expressing Him of Whom are all things; and, by mentioning the Lord, signifyings the Word by Whom are all things; and yet further, by adding the words Jesus Christ, announcing the incarnation, setting forth the passion and publishing the resurrection. For the word Jesus Christ suggests all these ideas to us. For this reason too before His passion our Lord deprecates the designation of \"Jesus Christ,\" and charges His disciples to \"tell no man that He was Jesus, the Christ.\"[fn-26-P2677_900209:25-nf] For His purpose was, after the completion of the oeconomy,[fn-26-P2678_900288:26-nf] after His resurrection froth the dead, and His assumption into heaven, to commit to them the preaching of Him as Jesus, the Christ. Such is the force of the words \"That they may know Thee the only true God and JesUs Christ whom thou hast sent,\"[fn-26-P2679_900611:27-nf] and again \"Ye believe in God, believe also in me.\"[fn-26-P2680_900681:28-nf] Everywhere the Holy Ghost secures our conception of Him to save us from falling in else direction while we advance in the other, heeding the theology but neglecting the oeconomy,[fn-26-P2681_900878:29-nf] and so by omission falling into impiety.","index":"5","references":[{"fn":"26","code":"P2661_896588","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"Asserted at Seleucia and Ariminum.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"26","code":"P2662_896638","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"cf.

Now let us examine, and to the best of our ability explain, the meaning of the words of Holy Scripture, which our opponents seize and wrest to their own sense, and urge against us for the destruction of the glory of the Only-begotten.

Of His own will He came to live the life of men. He did not say \"I have lived because of the Father,\" but \"I live because of the Father,\" clearly indicating the present time, and the Christ, having the word of God in Himself, is able to call the life which He leads, life, and that this is His meaning we shall learn from what follows. \"He that eateth me,\" He says, \"he also shall live because of me;\"[fn-26-P2685_902676:32-nf] for we eat His flesh, and drink His blood, being made through His incarnation and His visible life partakers of His Word and of His Wisdom.

And again, \"My Father is greater than I.\"[fn-26-P2688_903728:34-nf] This passage is also employed by the ungrateful creatures, the brood of the evil one. I believe that even from this passage the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father is set forth. For I know that comparisons may properly be made between things which are of the same nature. We speak of angel as greater than angel, of man as juster than man, of bird as fleeter than bird. If then comparisons are made between things of the same species, and the Father by comparison is said to be greater than the Son, then the Son is of the same substance as the Father. But there is another sense underlying the expression. In what is it extraordinary that He who \"is the Word and was made flesh\"[fn-26-P2689_904436:35-nf] confesses His Father to be greater than Himself, when He was seen in glory inferior to the angels, and in form to men?

Our Saviour's holy disciples, after getting beyond the limits of human thought, and then being purified by the word,[fn-27-P2701_907540:45-nf] are enquiring about the end, and longing to know the ultimate blessedness which our Lord declared to be unknown to His angels and to Himself. He calls all the exact comprehension of the purposes of God, a day; and the contemplation of the One-ness and Unity, knowledge of which He attributes to the Father alone, an hour. I apprehend, therefore, that God is said to know of Himself what is; and not to know what is not God, Who is, of His own nature, very righteousness and wisdom, is said to know righteousness and wisdom; but to be ignorant of unrighteousness and wickedness; for God who created us is not unrighteousness and wickedness. If, then, God is said to know about Himself that which is, and not to know that which is not; and if our Lord, according to the purpose of the Incarnation and the denser doctrine, is not the ultimate object of desire; then our Saviour does not know the end and the ultimate blessedness. But He says the angels do not know;[fn-27-P2702_908562:46-nf] that is to say, not even the contemplation which is in them, nor the methods of their ministries are the ultimate object of desire. For even their knowledge, when compared with the knowledge which is face to face, is dense.[fn-27-P2703_908806:47-nf] Only the Father, He says, knows, since He is Himself the end and the ultimate blessedness, for when we no longer know God in mirrors and not immediately,[fn-27-P2704_909839:48-nf] but approach Him as one and alone, then we shall know even the ultimate end. For all material knowledge is said to be the kingdom of Christ; while immaterial knowledge, and so to say the knowledge of actual Godhead, is that of God the Father. But our Lord is also Himself the end anti the ultimate blessedness according to the purpose of the Word; for what does He say in the Gospel? \"I will raise him up at the last day.\"[fn-27-P2705_910453:49-nf] He calls the transition from material knowledge to immaterial contemplation a resurrection, speaking of that knowledge after which there is no other, as the last day: for our intelligence is raised up and roused to a height of blessedness at the time when it contemplates the One-ness and Unity of the Word. But since our intelligence is made dense and bound to earth, it is both commingled with clay and incapable of gazing intently in pure contemplation, being led through adornments[fn-27-P2706_910957:50-nf] cognate to its own body. It considers the operations of the Creator, and judges of them meanwhile by their effects, to the end that growing little by little it may one day wax strong enough to approach even the actual unveiled Godhead. This is the meaning, I think, of the words \"my Father is greater than I,\"[fn-27-P2707_911834:51-nf] and also of the statement, \"It is not mine to give save to those for whom it is prepared by my Father.\"[fn-27-P2708_911957:52-nf] This too is what is meant by Christ's \"delivering up the kingdom to God even the Father;\"[fn-27-P2709_912091:53-nf] inasmuch as according to the denser doctrine which, as I said, is regarded relatively to us and not to the Son Himself, He is not the end but the first fruits. It is in accordance with this view that when His disciples asked Him again in the Acts of the Apostles, \"When wilt thou restore the kingdom of Israel?\" He replied, \"It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in His own power.\"[fn-27-P2710_912532:54-nf] That is to say, the knowledge of such a kingdom is not for them that are bound in flesh and blood. This contemplation the Father hath put away in His own power, meaning by \"power\" those that are empowered, and by \"His own\" those who are not held down by the ignorance of things below. Do not, I beg you, have in mind times and seasons of sense but certain distinctions of knowledge made by the sun apprehended by mental perception. For our Lord's prayer must be carried out. It is Jesus Who prayed \"Grant that they may be one in us as I and Thou are one, Father.\"[fn-27-P2711_913115:55-nf] For when God, Who is one, is in each, He makes all out; and number is lost in the in-dwelling of Unity.","index":"9","references":[{"fn":"27","code":"P2701_907540","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"cf.

The third is the resurrection of the dead. In these you will find the Holy Ghost cooperating with the Father and the Son.

Nor would any one teach the mind to reach objects of mental perception; and just as the senses in the case of their being in any way diseased, or injured, require only proper treatment and then readily fulfil their own functions; just so the mind, imprisoned in flesh. and full of the thoughts that arise thence, requires faith anti right conversation which make \"its feet like hinds' feet. and set it on its high places.\"[fn-27-P2754_928847:90-nf] The same advice is given us by Solomon the wise, who in one passage offers us the example of the diligent worker the ant,[fn-27-P2755_928989:91-nf] and recommends her active life; and in another the work of the wise bee in forming its cells,[fn-27-P2756_929105:92-nf] and thereby suggests a natural contemplation wherein also the doctrine of the Holy Trinity is contained, if at least the Creator is considered in proportion to the beauty of the things created.","index":"17","references":[{"fn":"27","code":"P2753_927649","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"Wisdom viii. 4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"wisdom","chapter":8,"verses":[4]}]},{"fn":"27","code":"P2754_928847","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"Ps. xviii. 33.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":18,"verses":[33]}]},{"fn":"27","code":"P2755_928989","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"cf.
