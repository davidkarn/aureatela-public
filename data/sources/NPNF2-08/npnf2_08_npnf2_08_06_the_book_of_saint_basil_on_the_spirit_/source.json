Your desire for information, my right well-beloved and most deeply respected brother Amphilochius, I highly commend, and not less your industrious energy. I have been exceedingly delighted at the care and watchfulness shewn in the expression of your opinion that of all the terms concerning God in every mode of speech, not one ought to be left without exact investigation. You have turned to good account your reading of the exhortation of the Lord, \"Every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth\"[fn-11-P1129_257605:1-nf] and by your diligence in asking might, I ween, stir even the most reluctant to give you a share of what they possess. And this in you yet further moves my admiration, that you do not, according to the manners of the most part of the men of our time, propose your questions by way of mere test, but with the honest desire to arrive at the actual truth. There is no lack in these days of captious listeners and questioners; but to find a character desirous of information, and seeking the truth as a remedy for ignorance, is very difficult. Just as in the hunters snare, or in the soldier's ambush, the trick is generally ingeniously concealed, so it is with the inquiries of the majority of the questioners who advance arguments, not so much with the view of getting any good out of them, as in order that, in the event of their failing to elicit answers which chime in with their own desires, they may seem to have fair ground for controversy.","index":"35","references":[{"fn":"11","code":"P1129_257605","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"Luke xi. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":11,"verses":[10]}]}]},{"text":"2.

Now without knowledge there can be no making like; and knowledge is not got without lessons. The beginning of teaching is speech, and syllables and words are parts of speech. It follows then that to investigate syllables is not to shoot wide of the mark, nor, because the questions raised are what might seem to some insignificant, are they on that account to be held unworthy of heed. Truth is always a quarry hard to hunt, and therefore we must look everywhere for its tracks. The acquisition of true religion is just like that of crafts; both grow bit by bit; apprentices must despise nothing. If a man despise the first elements as small and insignificant, he will never reach the perfection of wisdom.","index":"36","references":[{"fn":"11","code":"P1131_258636","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"Prov. xvii. 28, lxx.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","chapter":17,"verses":[28]}]},{"fn":"11","code":"P1132_258793","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"Is. ii. 3, lxx.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":2,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"11","code":"P1133_259317","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"Phil. iii. 14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"philippians","chapter":3,"verses":[14]}]}]},{"text":"Yea and Nay are but two syllables, yet there is often involved in these little words at once the best of all good things, Truth, and that beyond which wickedness cannot go, a Lie.

There is involved a deep and covert design against true religion· Their pertinacious contention is to show that the mention of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost is unlike, as though they will thence find it easy to demonstrate that there is a variation in nature. They have an old sophism, invented by Aetius, the champion of this heresy, in one of whose Letters there is a passage to the effect that things naturally unlike are expressed in unlike terms, and, conversely, that things expressed in unlike terms are naturally unlike. In proof of this statement he drags in the words of the Apostle, \"One God and Father of whom are all things, ... and one Lord Jesus Christ by whom are all things·\"[fn-11-P1145_265428:9-nf] \"Whatever, then,\" he goes on, \"is the relation of these terms to one another, such will be the relation of the natures indicated by them; and as the term `of whom' is unlike the term `by whom,' so is the Father unlike the Son.\"[fn-11-P1146_265676:10-nf] On this heresy depends the idle subtilty of these men about the phrases in question.

Hist. ii. 23) is as follows: \"Constantius, on his return from the west, passed some time at Constantinople\" (i.e.in 360, when the synod at Constantinople was held, shortly after that of the Isaurian Seleucia, \"substance\" and \"hypostasis\" being declared inadmissible terms, and the Son pronounced like the Father according to the Scriptures). The Emperor was urged that \"Eudoxuis should be convicted of blasphemy and lawlessness. Constantius however . . . replied that a decision must first be come to on matters concerning the faith, and that afterwards the case of Eudoxius should be enquired into. Basilius (of Ancyra), relying on his former intimacy, ventured boldly to object to the Emperor that he was attacking the apostolic decrees; but Constantius took this ill, and told Basilius to hold his tongue, for to you, said he, the disturbance of the churches is due. When Basilius was silenced, Eustathius (of Sebasteia) intervened and said, Since, sir, you wish a decision to be come to on what concerns the faith, consider the blasphemies uttered against the Only Begotten by Eudoxius; and, as he spoke, he produced the exposition of faith, wherein, besides many other impieties, were found the following expressions: Things that are spoken of in unlike terms are unlike in substance; there is one God the Father of Whom are all things, and one Lord Jesus Christ by Whom are all things. Now the term 'of Whom' is unlike the term 'by Whom;' so the Son is unlike God the Father. Constantius ordered this exposition of the faith to be read, and was displeased with the blasphemy which it involved. He therefore asked Eudoxius if he had drawn it up. Eudoxius instantly repudiated the authorship, and said that it was written by Aetius. Now Aetius . . . at the present time was associated with Eunomius and Eudoxius, and, as he found Eudoxius to be, like himself, a sybarite in luxury as well as a heretic in faith, he chose Antioch as the most congenial place of abode, and both he and Eunomius were fast fixtures at the couches of Eudoxius. . . . TheEmperor had been told all this, and now ordered Aetius to be brought before him. On his appearance, Constantius shewed him the document in question, and proceeded to enquire if he was the author of its language. Aetius, totally ignorant of what had taken place, and unaware of the drift of the enquiry, expected that he should win praise by confession, and owned that he was the author of the phrases in question. Then the Emperor perceived the greatness of his iniquity, and forthwith condemned him to exile and to be deported to a place in Phrygia.\" St. Basil accompanied Eustathius and his namesake to Constantinople on this occasion, being then only in deacon's orders. (Philost. iv. 12.) Basil of Ancyra and Eusthathius in their turn suffered banishment.

Similarly they appropriate \"of which\" to the material, in that the tiring made is \"of\" wood, while \"according to which\" shews the design, or pattern put before the craftsman.

For instance, the phrase \"of which\" does not always and absolutely, as they suppose, indicate the material,[fn-11-P1166_275824:20-nf] but it is more in accordance with the usage of Scripture to apply this term in the case of the Supreme Cause, as in the words \"One God, of whom are all things,\"[fn-11-P1167_276074:21-nf] and again, \"All things of God.\"[fn-11-P1168_276783:22-nf] The word of truth has, however, frequently used this term in the case of the material, as when it says \"Thou shalt make an ark of incorruptible wood;\"[fn-11-P1169_276955:23-nf] and \"Thou shall make the candlestick of pure gold ;\"[fn-11-P1170_277028:24-nf] and \"The first man is of the earth, earthy;[fn-11-P1171_277426:25-nf] and \"Thou art formed out of clay as I am.\"[fn-11-P1172_277487:26-nf] But these men, to the end, as we have already remarked, that they may establish the difference of nature, have laid down the law that this phrase befits the Father alone.

Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, or being his counsellor hath taught him?\"[fn-11-P1185_281357:33-nf] Now the word \"who\" in this passage does not mean absolute impossibility, but rarity, as in the passage \"Who will rise up for me against the evil doers?\"[fn-11-P1186_281544:34-nf] and \"What man is he that desireth life?\"[fn-11-P1187_281606:35-nf] and \"Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord?\"[fn-11-P1188_281675:36-nf] So is it in the passage in question, \"Who hath directed [lxx., known] the Spirit of the Lord, or being his counsellor hath known him?\" \"For the Father loveth the Son and sheweth him all things.\"[fn-11-P1189_281890:37-nf] This is He who holds the earth, and hath grasped it with His hand. who brought all things to order and adornment, who poised[fn-11-P1190_282033:38-nf] the hills in their places, and measured the waters, and gave to all things in the universe their proper rank, who encompasseth the whole of heaven with but a small portion of His power, which, in a figure, the prophet calls a span. Well then did the apostle add \"Of him and through him and to him are all things.\"[fn-11-P1191_282364:39-nf] For of Him, to all things that are, comes the cause of their being, according to the will of God the Father.

For instance, what happened in Noah's time is prior to what happened to the men of Sodom, inasmuch as Noah is more remote from our own day; and, again, the events of the history of the men of Sodom are posterior, because they seem in a sense to approach nearer to our own day. But, in addition to its being a breach of true religion, is it not really the extremest folly to measure the existence of the life which transcends all time and all the ages by its distance from the present?

It will follow that we should next in order point out the character of the provision of blessings bestowed on us by the Father \"through him.\" Inasmuch as all created nature, both this visible world and all that is conceived of in the mind, cannot hold together without the care and providence of God, the Creator Word, the Only begotten God, apportioning His succour according to the measure of the needs of each, distributes mercies various and manifold on account of the many kinds and characters of the recipients of His bounty, but appropriate to the necessities of individual requirements. Those that are confined in the darkness of ignorance He enlightens: for this reason He is true Light.[fn-13-P1354_322518:171-nf] Portioning requital in accordance with the desert of deeds, He judges: for this reason He is righteous Judge.[fn-13-P1355_322649:172-nf] \"For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son.\"[fn-13-P1356_322744:173-nf] Those that have lapsed from the lofty height of life into sin He raises from their fall: for this reason He is Resurrection.[fn-13-P1357_322890:174-nf] Effectually working by the much of His power and the will of His goodness He does all things. He shepherds; He enlightens; He nourishes; He heals; He guides; He raises up; He calls into being things that were not; He upholds what has been created. Thus the good things that come from God reach us \"through the Son,\" who works in each case with greater speed than speech can utter. For not lightnings, not light's course in air, is so swift; not eyes' sharp turn, not the movements of our very thought. Navy by the divine energy is each one of these in speed further surpassed than is the slowest of all living creatures outdone in motion by birds, or even winds, or the rush of the heavenly bodies: or, not to mention these, by our very thought itself. For what extent of time is needed by Him who \"upholds all things by the word of His power, \"[fn-13-P1358_323755:175-nf] and works not by bodily agency, nor requires the help of hands to form and fashion, but holds in obedient following and unforced consent the nature of all things that are?

Some \"were baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea.\"[fn-14-P1484_362053:265-nf] And it is admitted that faith even before now has been put in men; for \"The people believed God and his servant Moses.\"[fn-14-P1485_362201:266-nf] Why then, it is asked, do we, on account of faith and of baptism, exalt and magnify the Holy Spirit so far above creation, when there is evidence that the same things have before now been said of men? What, then, shall we reply? Our answer is that the faith in the Spirit is the same as the faith in the Father and the Son; and in like manner, too, the baptism. But the faith in Moses and in the cloud is, as it were, in a shadow and type. The nature of the divine is very frequently represented by the rough and shadowy outlines[fn-14-P1486_362751:267-nf] of the types;but because divine things are prefigured by small and human things, it is obvious that we must not therefore conclude the divine nature to be small. The type is an exhibition of things expected, and gives an imitative anticipation of the future. So Adam was a type of\"Him that was to come.\"[fn-14-P1487_363080:268-nf] Typically, \"That rock was Christ;\"[fn-14-P1488_363356:269-nf] and the water a type of the living power of the word; as He says, \"If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.\"[fn-14-P1489_363494:270-nf] The manna is a type of the living bread that came down from heaven;[fn-14-P1490_363583:271-nf] and the serpent on the standard,[fn-14-P1491_363637:272-nf] of the passion of salvation accomplished by means of the cross, wherefore they who even looked thereon were preserved. So in like manner, the history of the exodus of Israel is recorded to shew forth those who are being saved through baptism. For the firstborn of the Israelites were preserved, like the bodies of the baptized, by the giving of grace to them that were marked with blood. For the blood of the sheep is a type of the blood of Christ; and the firstborn, a type of the first-formed. And inasmuch as the first-formed of necessity exists in us, and, in sequence of succession, is transmitted till the end, it follows that \"in Adam\" we \"all die,\"[fn-14-P1492_364318:273-nf] and that \"death reigned\"[fn-14-P1493_364409:274-nf] until the fulfilling of the law and the coming of Christ. And the firstborn were preserved by God from being touched by the destroyer, to show that we who were made alive in Christ no longer die in Adam. The sea and the cloud for the time being led on through amazement to faith, but for the time to come they typically prefigured the grace to be. \"Who is wise and he shall understand these things?\"[fn-14-P1494_364831:275-nf] -how the sea is typically a baptism bringing about the departure of Pharaoh. in like manner as this washing causes the departure of the tyranny of the devil.

The dispensation of our God and Saviour concerning man is a recall from the fall and a return from the alienation caused by disobedience to close communion with God. This is the mason for the sojourn of Christ in the flesh, the pattern life described in the Gospels, the sufferings, the cross, the tomb, the resurrection; so that the man who is being saved through imitation of Christ receives that old adoption. For perfection of life the imitation of Christ is necessary, not only in the example of gentleness,[fn-15-P1524_371731:298-nf] lowliness, and long suffering set us in His life, but also of His actual death. So Paul, the imitator of Christ,[fn-15-P1525_371865:299-nf] says, \"being made conformable unto his death; if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-15-P1526_372254:300-nf] How then are we made in the likeness of His death?[fn-15-P1527_372330:301-nf] In that we were buried[fn-15-P1528_372379:302-nf] with Him by baptism. What then is the manner of the burial? And what is the advantage resulting from the imitation? First of all, it is necessary that the continuity of the old life be cut. And this is impossible less a man be born again, according to the Lord's word;[fn-15-P1529_372670:303-nf] for the regeneration, as indeed the name shews, is a beginning of a second life. So before beginning the second, it is necessary to put an end to the first. For just as in the case of runners who turn and take the second course,[fn-15-P1530_372956:304-nf] a kind of halt and pause intervenes between the movements in the opposite direction, so also inmaking a change in lives it seemed necessary for death to come as mediator between the two, ending all that goes before, and beginning all that comes after. How then do we achieve the descent into hell? By imitating, through baptism, the burial of Christ. For the bodies of the baptized are, as it were, buried in the water. Baptism then symbolically signifies the putting off of the works of the flesh; as the apostle says, ye were \"circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ; buried with him in baptism.\" And there is, as it were, a cleansing of the soul from the filth[fn-15-P1531_373733:305-nf] that has grown on it from the carnal mind,[fn-15-P1532_373982:306-nf] as it is written, \"Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.\"[fn-15-P1533_374080:307-nf] On this account we do not, as is the fashion of the Jews, wash ourselves at each defilement, but own the baptism of salvation[fn-15-P1534_374233:308-nf] to be one.[fn-15-P1535_374337:309-nf] For there the death on behalf of the world is one, and one the resurrection of the dead, whereof baptism is a type. For this cause the Lord, who is the Dispenser of our life, gave us the covenant of baptism, containing a type of life and death, for the water fulfils the image of death, and the Spirit gives us the earnest of life. Hence it follows that the answer to our question why the water was associated with the Spirit[fn-15-P1536_374781:310-nf] is clear: the reason is because in baptism two ends were proposed; on the one hand, the destroying of the body of sin,[fn-15-P1537_374927:311-nf] that it may never bear fruit unto death;[fn-15-P1538_374991:312-nf] on the other hand, our living unto the Spirit,[fn-15-P1539_375062:313-nf] and having our fruit in holiness;[fn-15-P1540_375119:314-nf] the water receiving the body as in a tomb figures death, while the Spirit pours in the quickening power, renewing our souls from the deadness of sin unto their original life. This then is what it is to be born again of water and of the Spirit, the being made dead being effected in the water, while our life is wrought in us through the Spirit. In three immersions,[fn-15-P1541_375509:315-nf] then, and with three invocations, the great mystery of baptism is performed, to the end that the type of death may be fully figured, and that by the tradition of the divine knowledge the baptized may have their souls enlightened. It follows that if there is any grace in the water, it is not of the nature of the water, but of the presence of the Spirit. For baptism is \"not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towards God.\"[fn-15-P1542_376000:316-nf] So in training us for the life that follows on the resurrection the Lord sets out all the manner of life required by the Gospel, laying down for us the law of gentleness, of endurance of wrong, of freedom from the defilement that comes of the love of pleasure, and from covetousness, to the end that we may of set purpose win beforehand and achieve all that the life to come of its inherent nature possesses. If therefore any one in attempting a definition were to describe the gospel as a forecast of the life that follows on the resurrection, he would not seem to me to go beyond what is meet and right.

Let us then revert to the point raised from the outset, that in all things the Holy Spirit is inseparable and wholly incapable of being parted from the Father and the Son. St. Paul, in the passage about the gift of tongues, writes to the Corinthians, \"If ye all prophesy and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all; and thus are the secrets of the heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God and report that God is in you of a truth.\"[fn-15-P1554_380518:323-nf] If then God is known to be in the prophets by the prophesying that is acting according to the distribution of the gifts of the Spirit, let our adversaries consider what kind of place they will attribute to the Holy Spirit. Let them say whether it is more proper to rank Him with God or to thrust Him forth to the place of the creature. Peter's words to Sapphira, \"How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Ye have not lied unto men, but unto God,\"[fn-15-P1555_381650:324-nf] show that sins against the Holy Spirit and against God are the same; and thus you might learn that in every operation the Spirit is closely conjoined with, and inseparable from, the Father and the Son. God works the differences of operations, and the Lord the diversities of administrations, but all the while the Holy Spirit is present too of His own will, dispensing distribution of the gifts according to each recipient's worth. For, it is said, \"there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit; and differences of administrations, but the same Lord; and there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.\"[fn-15-P1556_382351:325-nf] \"But all these,\" it is said, \"worketh that one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will.\"[fn-15-P1557_382496:326-nf] It must not however be supposed because in this passage the apostle names in the first place the Spirit, in the second the Son, and in the third God the Father, that therefore their rank is reversed. The apostle has only started in accordance with our habits of thought; for when we receive gifts, the first that occurs to us is the distributer, next we think of the sender, and then we lift our thoughts to the fountain and cause of the boons.","index":"123","references":[{"fn":"15","code":"P1554_380518","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"On the martyrs' baptism of blood, cf.

Moreover, from the things created at the beginning may be learnt the fellowship of the Spirit with the Father and the Son. The pure, intelligent, and supermundane powers are and are styled holy, because they have their holiness of the grace given by the Holy Spirit. Accordingly the mode of the creation of the heavenly powers is passed over in Silence, for the historian of the cosmogony has revealed to us only the creation of things perceptible by sense. But do thou, who hast power from the things that are seen to form an analogy of the unseen, glorify the Maker by whom all things were made, visible and invisible, principalities and powers, authorities, thrones, and dominions, and all other reasonable natures whom we cannot name.[fn-15-P1559_383788:327-nf] And in the creation bethink thee first, I pray thee, of the original cause of all things that are made, the Father; of the creative cause, the Son; of the perfecting cause, the Spirit; so that the ministering spirits subsist by the will of the Father, are brought into being by the operation of the Son, and perfected by the presence of the Spirit. Moreover, the perfection of angels is sanctification and continuance in it. And let no one imagine me either to affirm that there are three original hypostases[fn-15-P1560_384325:328-nf] or to allege the operation of the Son to be imperfect. For the first principle of existing things is One, creating through the Son and perfecting through the Spirit.[fn-15-P1561_384514:329-nf] The operation of the Father who worketh all in all is not imperfect, neither is the creating work of the Son incomplete if not perfected by the Spirit. The Father, who creates by His sole will, could not stand in any need of the Son, but nevertheless He wills through the Son; nor could the Son, who works according to the likeness of the Father, need co-operation, but the Son too wills to make perfect through the Spirit. \"For by the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath [the Spirit] of His mouth.\"[fn-15-P1562_385080:330-nf] The Word then is not a mere significant impression on the air, borne by the organs of speech; nor is the Spirit of His mouth a vapour, emitted by the organs of respiration; but the Word is He who \"was with God in the beginning\" and \"was God,\"[fn-15-P1563_385462:331-nf] and the Spirit of the mouth of God is \"the Spirit of truth which proceedeth from the Father.\"[fn-15-P1564_385668:332-nf] You are therefore to perceive three, the Lord who gives the order, the Word who creates,and the Spirit who confirms.[fn-15-P1565_385807:333-nf] And what other thing could confirmation be than the perfecting according to holiness? This perfectingexpresses the confirmation's firmness,unchangeableness,and fixity in good. But there is no sanctification without the Spirit. The powers of the heavens are not holy by nature; were it so there would in this respect be no difference between them and the Holy Spirit. It is in proportion to their relative excellence that they have their meed of holiness from the Spirit. The branding-iron is conceived of together with the fire; and yet the material and the fire are distinct. Thus too in the case of the heavenly powers; their substance is, peradventure, an aerial spirit, or an immaterial fire, as it is written, \"Who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire;\"[fn-15-P1566_386607:334-nf] wherefore they exist in space and become visible, and appear in their proper bodily form to them that are worthy. But their sanctification, being external to their substance, superinduces their perfection through the communion of the Spirit. They keep their rank by their abiding in the good and true, and while they retain their freedom of will, never fall away from their patient attendance on Him who is truly good. It results that, if by your argument you do away with the Spirit, the hosts of the angels are disbanded, the dominions of archangels are destroyed, all is thrown into confusion, and their life loses law, order, and distinctness. For how are angels to cry \"Glory to God in the highest\"[fn-15-P1567_387331:335-nf] without being empowered by the Spirit? For \"No man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost, and no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed;\"[fn-15-P1568_387931:336-nf] as might be said by wicked and hostile spirits, whose fall establishes our statement of the freedom of the will of the invisible powers; being, as they are, in a condition of equipoise between virtue and vice, and on this account needing the succour of the Spirit. I indeed maintain that even Gabriel[fn-15-P1569_388251:337-nf] in no other way foretells events to come than by the foreknowledge of the Spirit, by reason of the fact that one of the boons distributed by the Spirit is prophecy. And whence did he who was ordained to announce the mysteries of the vision to the Man of Desires[fn-15-P1570_388533:338-nf] derive the wisdom whereby he was enabled to teach hidden things, if not from the Holy Spirit? The revelation of mysteries is indeed the peculiar function of the Spirit, as it is written, \"God hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit.\"[fn-15-P1571_388790:339-nf] And how could \"thrones, dominions, principalities and powers\"[fn-15-P1572_388871:340-nf] live their blessed life, did they not \"behold the face of the Father which is in heaven\"?[fn-15-P1573_389017:341-nf] But to behold it is impossible without the Spirit! Just as at night, if you withdraw the light from the house, the eyes fall blind and their faculties become inactive, and the worth of objects cannot be discerned, and gold is trodden on in ignorance as though it were iron, so in the order of the intellectual world it is impossible for the high life of Law to abide without the Spirit. For it so to abide were as likely as that an army should maintain its discipline in the absence of its commander, or a chorus its harmony without the guidance of the coryphaeus. How could the Seraphim cry\"Holy, Holy, Holy,\"[fn-15-P1574_389650:342-nf] were they not taught by the Spirit how often true religion requires them to lift their voice in this ascription of glory? Do \"all His angels\" and \"all His hosts\"[fn-15-P1575_389831:343-nf] praise God? It is through the co-operation of the Spirit. Do \"thousand thousand\" of angels stand before Him, and\"ten thousand times ten thouSand\" ministering spirits?[fn-15-P1576_390022:344-nf] They are blamelessly doing their proper work by the power of the Spirit. All the glorious and unspeakable harmony[fn-15-P1577_390154:345-nf] of the highest heavens both in the service of God, and in the mutual concord of the celestial powers, can therefore only be preserved by the direction of the Spirit. Thus with those beings who are not gradually perfected by increase and advance,[fn-15-P1578_390423:346-nf] butare perfect from the moment of the creation, there is in creation the presence of the Holy Spirit, who confers on them the grace that flows from Him for the completion and perfection of their essence.[fn-15-P1579_390648:347-nf] ","index":"124","references":[{"fn":"15","code":"P1559_383788","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"1 Cor. xii. 4, 5, 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":12,"verses":[4]}]},{"fn":"15","code":"P1560_384325","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"1 Cor. xii. 11.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":12,"verses":[11]}]},{"fn":"15","code":"P1561_384514","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"cf.

Moreover by any one who carefully uses his reason it will be found that even at the moment of the expected appearance of the Lord from heaven the Holy Spirit will not, as some suppose, have no functions to discharge: on the contrary, even in the day of His revelation, in which the blessed and only potentate[fn-15-P1593_394396:359-nf] will judge the world in righteousness,[fn-15-P1594_394458:360-nf] the Holy Spirit will be present with Him. For who is so ignorant of the good things prepared by God for them that are worthy. as not to know that the crown of the righteous is the grace of the Spirit, bestowed in more abundant and perfect measure in that day, when spiritual glory shall be distributed to each in proportion as he shall have nobly played the man? For among the glories of the saints are \"many mansions\" in the Father's house,[fn-15-P1595_394927:361-nf] that is differences of dignities: for as \"star differeth from star in glory, so also is the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-15-P1596_395068:362-nf] They, then, that were sealed by the Spirit unto the day of redemption,[fn-15-P1597_395161:363-nf] and preserve pure anti undiminished the first fruits which they received of the Spirit, are they that shall hear the words\"well done thou good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things.\"[fn-15-P1598_395540:364-nf] In like manner they which have grieved the Holy Spirit by the wickedness of their ways, or have not wrought for Him that gave to them, shall be deprived of what they have received, their grace being transferred to others; or, according to one of the evangelists, they shall even be wholly cut asunder,[fn-15-P1599_395868:365-nf] -the cutting asunder meaning complete separation from the Spirit. The body is not divided, part being delivered to chastisement, and part let off; for when a whole has sinned it were like the old fables, and unworthy of a righteous judge, for only the half to suffer chastisement. Nor is the soul cut in two,-that soul the whole of which possesses the sinful affection throughout, and works the wickedness in co-operation with the body. The cutting asunder, as I have observed, is the separation for aye of the soul from the Spirit. For now, although the Spirit does not suffer admixture with the unworthy, He nevertheless does seem in a manner to be present with them that have once been sealed, awaiting the salvation which follows on their conversion; but then He will be wholly cut off from the soul that has defiled His grace.

But the greatest proof of the conjunction of the Spirit with the Father and the Son is that He is said to have the same relation to God which the spirit in us has to each of us. \"For what man\" it is said, \"knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God.\"[fn-16-P1603_397764:369-nf] ","index":"126","references":[{"fn":"15","code":"P1593_394396","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"1 Cor. xii. 28.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":12,"verses":[28]}]},{"fn":"15","code":"P1594_394458","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"cf. 1 Cor. xii. 11.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":12,"verses":[11]}]},{"fn":"15","code":"P1595_394927","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"1 Tim. vi. 15.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 timothy","chapter":6,"verses":[15]}]},{"fn":"15","code":"P1596_395068","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"Acts xvii. 31.","bible_refs":[{"book":"the acts","chapter":17,"verses":[31]}]},{"fn":"15","code":"P1597_395161","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"para tw= patpi/, (=chez le Père,) with little or no change of meaning, for e'n th= oi/ki/a tou= patro/j mou.

Those who are adepts in vain investigations tell us that, while some nouns are common and of widely extended denotation, others are more specific, and that the force of some is more limited than that of others. Essence, for instance, is a common noun, predicable of all things both animate and inanimate; while animal is more specific, being predicated of fewer subjects than the former, though of more than those which are considered under it, as it embraces both rational and irrational nature. Again, human is more specific than animal, and man than human, and than man the individual Peter, Paul or John.[fn-16-P1611_399026:372-nf] Do they then mean by sub-numerationthe division of the common into its subordinate parts? But I should hesitate to believe they have reached such a pitch of infatuation as to assert that the God of the universe, like some common quality conceivable only by reason and without actual existence in any hypostasis, is divided into subordinate divisions, and that then this subdivision is called sub-numeration. This would hardly be said even by men melancholy mad, for, besides its impiety, they are establishing the very opposite argument to their own contention. For the subdivisions are of the same essence as that from which they have been divided. The very obviousness of the absurdity makes it difficult for us to find arguments to confute their unreasonableness; so that really their folly looks like an advantage to them; just as soft and yielding bodies offer no resistance, and therefore cannot be struck a stout blow. It is impossible to bring a vigorous confutation to bear on a palpable absurdity. The only course open to us is topass by their abominable impiety in silence.

They try to insult the doctrines that concern the divine nature[fn-17-P1701_433367:443-nf] by comparing them with the human, and endeavour to apply to the ineffable nature of God that common custom of human life whereby the difference of degrees is variable, not perceiving that among men no one is a slave by nature. For men are either brought under a yoke of slavery by conquest, as when prisoners are taken in war; or they are enslaved on account of poverty, as the Egyptians were oppressed by Pharaoh; or, by a wise and mysterious dispensation, the worst children are by their fathers' order condemned to serve the wiser and the better;[fn-17-P1702_433937:444-nf] and this any righteous enquirer into the circumstances would declare to be not a sentence of condemnation but a benefit. For it is more profitable that the man who, through lack of intelligence, has no natural principle of rule within himself, should become the chattel of another, to the end that, being guided by the reason of his master, he may be like a chariot with a charioteer, or a boat with a steersman seated at the tiller. For this reason Jacob by his father's blessing became lord of Esau,[fn-17-P1703_434461:445-nf] in order that the foolish son, who had not intelligence, his proper guardian, might, even though he wished it not, be benefited by his prudent brother. So Canaan shall be \"a servant unto his brethren\"[fn-17-P1704_434717:446-nf] because, since his father Ham was unwise, he was uninstructed in virtue. In this world, then, it is thus that men are made slaves, but they who have escaped poverty or war, or do not require the tutelage of others, are free. It follows that even though one man be called master and another servant, nevertheless, both in view of our mutual equality of rank and as chattels of our Creator, we are all fellow slaves. But in that other world what can yon bring out of bondage? For no sooner were they created than bondage was commenced. The heavenly bodies exercise no rule over one another, for they are unmoved by ambition, but all bow down to God, and render to Him alike the awe which is due to Him as Master and the glower which fails to Him as Creator. For \"a son honoureth his father and a servant his master,\"[fn-17-P1705_435556:447-nf] and from all God asks one of these two things; for \"if I then be a Father where is my honour? and if I be a Master where is my fear?\"[fn-17-P1706_435713:448-nf] Otherwise the life of all men, if it were not under the oversight of a master, would be most pitiable; as is the condition of the apostate powers who, because they stiffen their neck against God Almighty, fling off the reins of their bondage,-not that their natural constitution is different; but the cause is in their disobedient disposition to their Creator. Whom then do you call free? Him who has no King? Him who has neither power to rule another nor willingness to be ruled? Among all existent beings no such nature is to be found.

But why get an unfair victory for our argument by fighting over these undignified questions, when it is within our power to prove that the excellence of the glory is beyond dispute by adducing more lofty considerations? If, indeed, we retreat what we have been taught by Scripture, every one of the Pneumatomachi will peradventure raise a loud and vehement outcry, stop their ears, pick up stones or anything else that comes to hand for a weapon, and charge against us. But our own security must not be regarded by us before the truth. We have learnt from the Apostle, \"the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patient waiting for Christ\"[fn-17-P1713_437265:451-nf] for our tribulations. Who is the Lord that directs into the love of God and into the patient waiting for Christ for tribulations? Let those men answer us who are for making a slave of the Holy Spirit. For if the argument had been about God the Father, it would certainly have said, `the Lord direct you into His own love,' or if about the Son, it would have added `into His own patience.' Let them then seek what other Person there is who is worthy to be honoured with the title of Lord. And parallel with this is that other passage, \"and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do towards you; to the end He may establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints.\"[fn-17-P1714_438094:452-nf] Now what Lord does he entreat to stablish the hearts of the faithful at Thessalonica, unblamable in holiness before God even our Father, at the coming of our Lord? Let those answer who place the Holy Ghost among the ministering spirits that are sent forth on service. They cannot. Wherefore let them hear yet another testimony which distinctly calls the Spirit Lord. \"The Lord,\" it is said, \"is that Spirit;\" and again \"even as from the Lord the Spirit.\"[fn-17-P1715_442465:453-nf] But to leave no ground for objection, I will quote the actual words of the Apostle;-\"For even unto this day remaineth the same veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament, which yell is done away in Christ. ... Nevertheless, when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. Now the Lord is that Spirit.\"[fn-17-P1716_443419:454-nf] Why does he speak thus? Because he who abides in the bare sense of the letter, and in it busies himself with the observances of the Law, has, as it were, got his own heart enveloped in the Jewish acceptance of the letter, like a veil; and this be-falls him because of his ignorance that the bodily observance of the Law is done away by the presence of Christ, in that for the future the types are transferred to the reality. Lamps are made needless by the advent of the sun; and, on the appearance of the truth, the occupation of the Law is gone, and prophecy is hushed into silence. He, on the contrary, who has been empowered to look down into the depth of the meaning of the Law, and, after passing through the obscurity of the letter, as through a veil, to arrive within things unspeakable, is like Moses taking off the veil when he spoke with God. He, too, turns from the letter to the Spirit. So with the veil on the face of Moses corresponds the obscurity of the teaching of the Law, and spiritual contemplation with the turning to the Lord. He, then, who in the reading of the Law takes away the letter and turns to the Lord,-and the Lord is now called the Spirit,-becomes moreover like Moses, who had his face glorified by the manifestation of God. For just as objects which lie near brilliant colours are themselves tinted by the brightness which is shed around, so is be who fixes his gaze firmly on the Spirit by the Spirit's glory somehow transfigured into greater splendour, having his heart lighted up, as it were, by some light streaming from the truth of the Spirit.[fn-17-P1717_445032:455-nf] And, this is \"being changed from[fn-17-P1718_445310:456-nf] the glory of the Spirit \"into\" His own \"glory,\" not in niggard degree, nor dimly and indistinctly, but as we might expect any one to be who is enlightened by[fn-17-P1719_445500:457-nf] the Spirit.

For my own part, although the usefulness of the word is obvious as soon as it is heard, I will nevertheless set forth the arguments which led our fathers to adopt the reasonable coarse of employing the preposition \"with.\"[fn-17-P1798_463328:516-nf] It does indeed equally well with the preposition \"and,\" confute the mischief of Sabellius;[fn-17-P1799_463444:517-nf] and it sets forth quite as well as \"and\" the distinction of the hypostases, as in the words \"I and my Father will come,\"[fn-18-P1800_463589:518-nf] and \"I and my Father are one.\"[fn-18-P1801_463640:519-nf] In addition to this the proof it contains of the eternal fellowship and uninterrupted conjunction is excellent. For to say that the Son is with the Father is to exhibit at once the distinction of the hypostases, and the inseparability of the fellowship. The same thing is observable even in mere human matters, for the conjunction \"and\" intimates that there is a common element in an action, while the preposition \"with\" declares in some sense as well the communion in action. As, for instance;-Paul and Timothy sailed to MaCedonia, but both Tychicus and Onesimus were sent to the Colossians. Hence we learn that they did the same thing. But suppose we are told that they sailed with, and were sent with? Then we are informed in addition that they carried out the action in company with one another. Thus while the word \"with\" upsets the error of Sabellius as no other word can, it routs also sinners who err in the very opposite direction; those, I mean, who separate the Son from the Father and the Spirit from the Son, by intervals of time.[fn-18-P1802_464907:520-nf] ","index":"166","references":[{"fn":"17","code":"P1794_461640","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"Ps. xliv. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":44,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"17","code":"P1795_461861","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"17","code":"P1796_462149","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"In Eph. ii. 18 they are combined, but no Scriptural doxology uses e'n of the Spirit.","bible_refs":[{"book":"ephesians","chapter":2,"verses":[18]}]},{"fn":"17","code":"P1797_462333","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"1 Thess. i. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 thessalonians","chapter":1,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"17","code":"P1798_463328","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"Matt. xxviii. 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":28,"verses":[19]}]},{"fn":"17","code":"P1799_463444","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"2 Cor. xiii. 13.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":13,"verses":[13]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1800_463589","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"Rom. xv. 30.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":15,"verses":[30]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1801_463640","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"\"St. Basil's statement of the reason of the use of meta/ su/n, in the Doxology, is not confirmed by any earlier or contemporary writer, as far as the editor is aware, nor is it contradicted.\" Rev.

It is an extraordinary statement, but it is none the less true, that the Spirit is frequently spoken of as the place of them that are being sanctified, and it will become evident that even by this figure the Spirit, so far from being degraded, is rather glorified. For words applicable to the body are, for the sake of clearness, frequently transferred in scripture to spiritual conceptions.

For the grace flowing from Him when He dwells in those that are worthy, and carries out His own operations, is well described as existing in those that are able to receive Him. On the other hand His essential existence before the ages, and His ceaseless abiding with Son and Father, cannot be contemplated without requiring titles expressive of eternal conjunction. For absolute and real co-existence is predicated in the case of things which are mutually inseparable. We say, for instance, that beat exists in the hot iron, but in the case of the actual fire it co-exists; and, similarly, that health exists in the body, but that life co-exists with the soul. It follows that wherever the fellowship is intimate, congenital,[fn-18-P1842_476145:553-nf] and inseparable, the word with is more expressive, suggesting, as it does, the idea of inseparable fellowship. Where on the other hand the grace flowing from the Spirit naturally comes and goes, it is properly and truly said to exist in, even if on account of the firmness of the recipients' disposition to good the grace abides with them continually. Thus whenever we have in mind the Spirit's proper rank, we contemplate Him as being with the Father and the Son, but when we think of the grace that flows from Him operating on those who participate in it, we say that the Spirit is in us. And the doxology which we offer \"in the Spirit\" is not an acknowledgment of His rank; it is rather a confession of our own weakness, while we shew that we are not sufficient to glorify Him of ourselves, but our sufficiency[fn-18-P1843_479376:554-nf] is in the Holy Spirit. Enabled in, [or by,] Him we render thanks to our God for the benefits we have received, according to the measure of our purification from evil, as we receive one a larger and another a smaller share of the aid of the Spirit, that we may offer \"the sacrifice of praise to God.\"[fn-18-P1844_479694:555-nf] According to one use, then, it is thus that we offer our thanksgiving, asthe true religion requires, in the Spirit; although it is not quite unobjectionable that any one should testify of himself \"the Spirit of God is in me, and I offer glory after being made wise through the grace that flows from Him.\" For to a Paul it is becoming to say \"I think also that I have the Spirit of God,\"[fn-18-P1845_480099:556-nf] and again, \"that good thing which was committed to thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.\"[fn-18-P1846_480227:557-nf] And of Daniel it is fitting to say that \"the Holy Spirit of God is in him,\"[fn-18-P1847_480325:558-nf] and similarly of men who are like these in virtue.","index":"172","references":[{"fn":"18","code":"P1840_475165","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"1 Cor. xiv. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":14,"verses":[2]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1841_475269","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"1 Peter i. 11.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 peter","chapter":1,"verses":[11]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1842_476145","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"e'n to =j genhtoi=j, as in the Bodleian ms.

Another sense may however be given to the phrase, that just as the Father is seen in the Son, so is the Son in the Spirit. The \"worship in the Spirit\" suggests the idea of the operation of our intelligence being carried on in the light, as may be learned from the words spoken to the woman of Samaria. Deceived as she was by the customs of her country into the belief that worship was local, our Lord, with the object of giving her better instruction, said that worship ought to be offered \"in Spirit and in Truth,\"[fn-18-P1849_480918:559-nf] plainly meaning by the Truth, Himself. As then we speak of the worship offered in the Image of God the Father as worship in the Son, so too do we speak of worship in the Spirit as shewing in Himself the Godhead of the Lord. Wherefore even in our worship the Holy Spirit is inseparable from the Father and the Son. If you remain outside the Spirit you will not be able even to worship at all; and on your becoming in Him you will in no wise be able to dissever Him from God;-any more than you will divorce light from visible objects. For it is impossible to behold the Image of the invisible God except by the enlightenment of the Spirit, and impracticable for him to fix his gaze on the Image to dissever the light from the Image, because the cause of vision is of necessity seen at the same time as the visible objects. Thus fitly and consistently do we behold the \"Brightness of the glory\" of God by means of the illumination of the Spirit, and by means of the \"Express Image\" we are led up to Him of whom He is the Express Image and Seal, graven to the like.[fn-18-P1850_482001:560-nf] ","index":"173","references":[{"fn":"18","code":"P1849_480918","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"2 Tim.

Now it has been asserted in the previous portion of this treatise that the word \"in\" has not been specially allotted to the Holy Spirit, but is common to the Father and the Son. It has also been, in my opinion, sufficiently demonstrated that, so far from detracting anything from the dignity of the Spirit, it leads all, but those whose thoughts are wholly perverted, to the sublimest height.

And these no one will gainsay;-no one, at all events, who is even moderately versed in the institutions of the Church. For were we to attempt to reject such customs as have no written authority, on the ground that the importance they possess is small, we should unintentionally injure the Gospel in its very vitals; or, rather, should make our public definition a mere phrase and nothing more.[fn-18-P1859_486470:564-nf] For instance, to take the first and most general example, who is thence who has taught us in writing to sign with the sign of the cross those who have trusted in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ? What writing has taught us to turn to the East at the prayer? Which of the saints has left us in writing the words of tim invocation at the displaying[fn-18-P1860_491290:565-nf] of the bread of the Eucharist and the cup of blessing? For we are not, as is well known, content with what the apostle or the Gospel has recorded, but both in preface and conclusion we add other words as being of great importance to the validity of the ministry, and these we derive from unwritten teaching. Moreover we bless the water of baptism andthe oil of the chrism, and besides this the catechumen who is being baptized. On what written authority do we do this? Is not our authority silent and mystical tradition? Nay, by what written word is the anointing of oil[fn-18-P1861_492104:566-nf] itself taught? And whence comes the custom of baptizing thrice?[fn-18-P1862_492340:567-nf] And as to the other customs of baptism from what Scripture do we derive the renunciation of Satan and his angels? Does not this come from that unpublished and secret teaching which oar fathers guarded in a silence out of the reach of curious meddling and inquisitive investigation? Well had they learnt the lesson that the awful dignity of the mysteries is best preserved by silence. What the uninitiated are not even allowed: to look at was hardly likely to be publiclyparaded about in written documents. What was the meaning of the mighty Moses in not making all the parts of the tabernacle open to every one? The profane he stationed without the sacred barriers; the first courts he conceded to the purer; the Levites alone he judged worthy of being servants of the Deity; sacrifices and burnt offerings and the rest of the priestly functions he allotted to the priests; one chosen out of all he admitted to the shrine, and even this one not always but on only one day in the year, and of this one day a time was fixed for his entry so that he might gaze on the Holy of Holies amazed at the strangeness and novelty of the sight. Moses was wise enough to know that contempt stretches to the trite and to the obvious, while a keen interest is naturally associated with the unusual and the unfamiliar. In the same manner the Apostles and Fathers who laid down laws for the Church from the beginning thus guarded the awful dignity of the mysteries in secrecy and silence, for what is bruited abroad random among the common folk is no mystery at all. This is the reason for our tradition of unwritten precepts and practices, that the knowledge of our dogmas may not become neglected and contemned by the multitude through familiarity. \"Dogma\" and \"Kerugma\" are two distinct things; the former is observed in silence; the latter is proclaimed to all the world. One form of this silence is the obscurity employed in Scripture, which makes the meaning of \"dogmas\" difficult to be understood for the very advantage of the reader: Thus we all look to the East[fn-18-P1863_496971:568-nf] at our prayers, but few of us know that we are seeking our own old country,[fn-18-P1864_497282:569-nf] Paradise, which God planted in Eden in the East.[fn-18-P1865_497529:570-nf] We pray standing,[fn-18-P1866_497603:571-nf] on the first day of the week, but we do not all know the reason. On the day of the resurrection (or \"standing again\" Grk. a0na/stasij we remind ourselves of the grace given to us by standing at prayer, not only because we rose with Christ,[fn-18-P1867_497868:572-nf] and are bound to \"seek those things which are above,\"[fn-18-P1868_497941:573-nf] but because the day seems to us to be in some sense an image of the age which we expect, wherefore, though it is the beginning of days, it is not called by Moses first, but one.[fn-18-P1869_498455:574-nf] For he says \"There was evening, and therewas morning, one day,\" as though the same day often recurred. Now \"one and \"eighth\" are the same, in itself distinctly indicating that really \"one\" and \"eighth\" of which the Psalmist makes mention in certain titles of the Psalms, the state which follows after this present time, the day which knows no waning or eventide, and no successor, that age which endeth not or groweth old.[fn-18-P1870_498922:575-nf] Of necessity, then, the church teaches her own foster children to offer their prayers on that day standing, to the end that through continual reminder of the endless life we may not neglect to make provision for our removal thither. Moreover all Pentecost is a reminder of the resurrection expected in the age to come. For that one and first day, if seven times multiplied by seven, completes the seven weeks of the holy Pentecost; for, beginning at the first, Pentecost ends with the same, making fifty revolutions through the like intervening days. And so it is a likeness of eternity, beginning as it does and ending, as in a circling course, at the same point. On this day the rules of the church have educated us to prefer the upright attitude of prayer, for by their plain reminder they, as It were, make our mind to dwell no longer in the present but in the future. Moreover every time we fall upon our knees and rise from off them we shew by the very deed that by our sin we fell down to earth, and by the loving kindness of our Creator were called hack to heaven.","index":"177","references":[{"fn":"18","code":"P1856_483019","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"John iv. 24.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":4,"verses":[24]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1857_483150","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"cf. note on § 15.

Wherefore we use both words, by the one expressing the dignity of the Spirit; by the other announcing the grace that is with us. Thus we ascribe glory to God both \"in\" the Spirit, and \"with\" the Spirit; and herein it is not our word that we use, but we follow the teaching of the Lord as we might a fixed rule, and transfer His word to things connected and closely related, and of which the conjunction in the mysteries is necessary. We have deemed ourselves under a necessary obligation to combine in our confession of the faith Him who is numbered with Them at Baptism, and we have treated the confession of the faith as the origin and parent of the doxology. What, then, is to be done? They must now instruct us either not to baptize as we have received, or not to believe as we were baptized, or not to ascribe glory as we have believed.

But if the greater number of our mysteries are admitted into our constitution without written authority, then, in company with the many others, let us receive this one. For I hold it apostolic to abide also by the unwritten traditions. \"I praise you,\" it is said, \"that ye remember me in all things, andkeep the ordinances as I delivered them to you;\"[fn-19-P1907_510586:601-nf] and \"Hold fast the traditions which ye have been taught whether by word, or our Epistle.\"[fn-19-P1908_510738:602-nf] One of these traditions is the practice which is now before us, which they who ordained from the beginning, rooted firmly in the churches, delivering it to their successors, and its use through long custom advances pace by pace with time. If, as in a Court of Law, we were at a loss for documentary evidence, but were able to bring before you a large number of witnesses, would you not give your vote for our acquittal?

There is the famous Irenaeus,[fn-19-P1913_512764:606-nf] and Clement of Rome;[fn-19-P1914_512805:607-nf] Dionysius of Rome,[fn-19-P1915_513091:608-nf] and, strange to say, Dionysius of Alexandria, in his second Letter to his namesake, on \"Conviction and Defence,\" so concludes. I will give you his very words. \"Following all these, we, too, since we have received from the presbyters who were before us a form and rule, offering thanksgiving in the same terms with them, thus conclude our Letter to you. To God the Father and the Son our Lord Jesus Christ, with the Holy Ghost, glory and might for ever and ever; amen.\" And no one can say that this passage has been altered. He would not have so persistently stated that he had received a form and rule if he had said \"in the Spirit.\" For of this phrase the use is abundant: it was the use of \"with\" which required defence. Dionysius moreover in the middle of his treatise thus writes in opposition to the Sabellians, \"If by the hypostases being three they say that they are divided, there are three, though they like it not. Else let them destroy the divine Trinity altogether.\" And again: \"most divine on this account after the Unity is the Trinity.\"[fn-19-P1916_514160:609-nf] Clement, in more primitive fashion, writes, \"God lives, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-19-P1917_514278:610-nf] And now let us bear how Irenaeus, who lived near the times of the Apostles, mentions the Spirit in his work \"Against the Heresies.\"[fn-19-P1918_514424:611-nf] \"The Apostle rightly calls carnal them that are unbridled and carried away to their own desires, having no desire for the Holy Spirit,\"[fn-19-P1919_515132:612-nf] and in another passage Irenaeus says, \"The Apostle exclaimed that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of the heavens lest we, being without share in the divine Spirit, fall short of the kingdom of the heavens.\" If any one thinks Eusebius of Palestine[fn-19-P1920_515471:613-nf] worthy of credit on account of his wide experience, I point further to the very words he uses in discussing questions concerning the polygamy of the ancients. Stirring up himself to his work, he writes \"invoking the holy God of the Prophets, the Author of light, through our Saviour Jesus Christ, with the Holy Spirit.\"73. Origen, too, in many of his expositions of the Psalms, we find using the form of doxology \"with the Holy Ghost. The opinions which he held concerning the Spirit were not always and everywhere sound; nevertheless in many passages even he himself reverently recognises the force of established usage, and expresses himself concerning the Spirit in terms consistent with true religion. It is, if I am not mistaken, in the Sixth[fn-19-P1921_516605:614-nf] Book of his Commentary on the Gospel of St. John that he distinctly makes the Spirit an object of worship. His words are:-\"The washing or water is a symbol of the cleaning of the soul which is washed clean of all filth that comes of wickedness;[fn-19-P1922_516914:615-nf] but none the less is it also by itself, to him who yields himself to the God-head of the adorable Trinity, through the power of the invocations, the origin and source of blessings.\" And again, in his Exposition of the Epistle to the Romans \"the holy powers,\" he says\"are able to receive the Only-begotten, and the Godhead of the Holy Spirit.\" Thus I apprehend, the powerful influence of traditionfrequently impels men to express themselves in terms contradictory to their own opinions.[fn-19-P1923_517703:616-nf] Moreover this form of the doxology was not unknowneven to Africanus the historian. In the Fifth Book of his Epitome of the Times he says \"we who know the weight of those terms, and are not ignorant of the grace of faith, render thanks to the Father, who bestowed on us His own creatures, Jesus Christ, the Saviour of the world and our Lord, to whom be glory and majesty with the Holy Ghost, for ever.\"[fn-19-P1924_518151:617-nf] The rest of the passages may peradventure be viewed with suspicion; or may really have been altered, and the fact of their having been tampered with will be difficult to detect because the difference consists in a single syllable. Those however which I have quoted at length are out of the reach of any dishonest manipulation, and can easily be verified from the actual works.","index":"187","references":[{"fn":"19","code":"P1913_512764","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"Job viii. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"job","chapter":8,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"19","code":"P1914_512805","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"i.e. Dianius, bp. of the Cappadocian Caesarea, who baptized St. Basil c. 357 on his return from Athens, and ordained him Reader.

I am sure that we shall do the truth a wrong if we refuse to number that soul with the people of God, shining as it did like a beacon in the Church of God; for by the fellow-working of the Spirit the power which he had over demons was tremendous, and so gifted was he with the grace of the word \"for obedience to the faith among ...the nations,\"[fn-19-P1932_523430:623-nf] that, although only seventeen Christians were handed over to him, hebrought the whole people alike in town and country through knowledge to God.

To recount all his wonderful works in detail would be too long a task. By the superabundance of gifts, wrought in him by the Spirit in all power and in signs and in marvels, he was styled a second Moses by the very enemies of the Church. Thus in all that he through grace accomplished, alike byword and deed, a light seemed ever to be shining, token of the heavenly power from the unseen which followed him. To this day he is a great object of admiration to the people of his own neighbourhood, and his memory, established in the churches ever fresh and green, is not dulled by length of time. Thus not a practice, not a word, not a mystic rite has been added to the Church besides what he bequeathed to it. Hence truly on account of the antiquity of their institution many of their ceremonies appear to be defective.[fn-19-P1935_525120:626-nf] For his successors in the administration of the Churches could not endure to accept any subsequent discovery in addition to what had had his sanction. Now one of the institutions of Gregory is the very form of the doxology to which objection is now made, preserved by the Church on the authority of his tradition; a statement which may be verified without much trouble by any one who likes to make a short journey. That our Firmilian held this belief is testified by the writings which he has left.[fn-19-P1936_525706:627-nf] The contemporaries also of the illustrious Meletius say that he was of this opinion. But why quote ancient authorities? Now in the East are not the maintainers of true religion known chiefly by this one term, and separated from their adversaries as by a watchword? I have heard from a certain Mesopotamian, a man at once well skilled in the language and of unperverted opinions, that by the usage of his country it is impossible for any one, even though he may wish to do so, to express himself in any other way, and that they are compelled by the idiom of their mother tongue to offer the doxology by the syllable \"and,\" or, I should more accurately say, by their equivalent expressions. We Cappadocians, too, so speak in the dialect of our country, the Spirit having so early. as the division of tongues foreseen the utility of the phrase.

How then can I be an innovator and creator of new terms, when I adduce as originators and champions of the word whole nations, cities, custom going back beyond the memory of man, men who were pillars of the church and conspicuous for all knowledge and spiritual power? For this cause this banded array of foes is set in motion against me, and town and village and remotest regions are full of my calumniators. Sad and painful are these things to them that seek for peace, but great is the reward of patience for sufferings endured for the Faith's sake. So besides these let sword flash, let axe be whetted, let fire burn fiercer than that of Babylon, let every instrument of torture be set in motion against me. To me nothing is more fearful than failure to fear the threats which the Lord has directed against them that blaspheme the Spirit.[fn-19-P1938_527594:628-nf] Kindly readers will find a satisfactory defence in what I have said, that I accept a phrase so dear and so familiar to the saints, and confirmed by usage so long, inasmuch as, from the day when the Gospel was first preached up to our own time, it is shewn to have been admitted to all full rights within the churches, and, what is of greatest moment, to have been accepted as bearing a sense in accordance with holiness and true religion. But before the great tribunal what have I prepared to say in my defence? This; that I was in the first place led to the glory of the Spirit by the honour conferred by the Lord in associating Him with Himself and with His Father at baptism;[fn-19-P1939_528440:629-nf] and secondly by the introduction of each of us to the knowledge of God by such an initiation; and above all by the fear of the threatened punishment shutting out the thought of all indignity and unworthy conception. But our opponents, what will they say? After shewing neither reverence for the Lord's honour[fn-19-P1940_528954:630-nf] nor fear of His threats, what kind of defence will they have for their blasphemy? It is for them to make up their mind about their own action or even now to change it. For my own part I would pray most earnestly that the good God will make His peace rule in the hearts of all,[fn-19-P1941_529258:631-nf] so that these men who are swollen with pride and set in battle array against us may be calmed by the Spirit of meekness and of love; and that if they have become utterly savage, and are in an untamable state, He will grant to us at least to bear with long suffering all that we have to bear at their hands. In short \"to them that have in themselves the sentence of death,\"[fn-19-P1942_529656:632-nf] it is not suffering for the sake of the Faith which is painful; what is hard to bear is to fail to fight its battle.

Or perhaps this was the time for silence spoken of by Solomon the wise.[fn-19-P1943_530239:633-nf] For, when life is buffeted by so fierce a storm that all the intelligence of those who are instructed in the word is filled with the deceit of false reasoning and confounded, like an eye filled with dust, when men are stunned by strange and awful noises, when all the world is shaken and everything tottering to its fall, what profits it to cry, as I am really crying, to the wind?","index":"190","references":[{"fn":"19","code":"P1938_527594","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"The Neocaesareans appear to have entertained a Puritan objection to the antiphonal psalmody becoming general in the Church in the time of Basil. cf.

To what then shall I liken our present condition? It may be compared, I think, to some naval battle which has arisen out of time old quarrels, and is fought by men who cherish a deadly hate against one another, of long experience in naval warfare, and eager for the fight. Look, I beg you, at the picture thus raised before your eyes. See the rival fleets rushing in dread array to the attack. With a burst of uncontrollable fury they engage and fight it out. Fancy, if you like, the ships driven to and fro by a raging tempest, while thick darkness falls from the clouds and blackens all the scenes so that watchwords are indistinguishable in the confusion, and all distinction between friend and foe is lost. To fill up the details of the imaginary picture, suppose the sea swollen with billows and whirled up from the deep, while a vehement torrent of rain pours down from the clouds and the terrible waves rise high. From every quarter of heaven the winds beat upon one point, where boththe fleets are dashed one against the other. Of the combatants some are turning traitors; some are deserting in the very thick of the fight; some have at one and the same moment to urge on their boats, all beaten by the gale, and to advance against their assailants. Jealousy of authority and the lust of individual mastery splits the sailors into parties which deal mutual death to one another. Think, besides all this, of the confused and unmeaning roar sounding over all the sea, from howling winds, from crashing vessels, from boiling surf, from the yells of the combatants as they express their varying emotions in every kind of noise, so that not a word from admiral or pilot can be heard. The disorder and confusion is tremendous, for the extremity of misfortune, when life is despaired of, gives men license for every kind of wickedness. Suppose, too, that the men are all smitten with the incurable plague of mad love of glory, so that they do not cease from their struggle each to get the better of the other, while their ship is actually settling down into the deep.","index":"193","references":[]},{"text":"77. Turn now I beg you from this figurative description to the unhappy reality. Did it not at one time[fn-19-P1949_532879:634-nf] appear that the Arian schism, after its separation into a sect opposed to the Church of God, stood itself alone in hostile array? But when the attitude of our foes against us was changed from one of long standing and bitter strife to one of open warfare, then, as is well known, the war was split up in more ways than I can tell into many subdivisions, so that all men were stirred to a state of inveterate hatred alike by common party spirit and individual suspicion.[fn-19-P1950_533368:635-nf] But what storm at sea was ever so fierce and wild as this tempest of the Churches? In it every landmark of the Fathers has been moved; every foundation. every bulwark of opinion has been shaken: everything buoyed up on the unsound is dashed about and shaken down. We attack one another. We are overthrown by one another. If our enemy is not the first to strike us, we are wounded by the comrade at our side. If a foeman is stricken and falls, his fellow soldier tramples him down. There is at least this bond of union between us that we hate our common foes, but no sooner have the enemy gone by than we find enemies in one another. And who could make a complete list of all the wrecks? Some have gone to the bottom on the attack of the enemy, some through the unsuspected treachery, of their allies, some from the blundering of their own officers. We see, as it were, whole churches, crews and all, dashed and shattered upon the sunken reefs of disingenuous heresy, while others of the enemies of the Spirit[fn-19-P1951_534398:636-nf] of Salvation have seized the helm and made shipwreck of the faith.[fn-19-P1952_534520:637-nf] And then the disturbances wrought by the princes of the world[fn-19-P1953_536883:638-nf] have caused the downfall of the people with a violence unmatched by that of hurricane or whirlwind. The luminaries of the world, which God set to give light to the souls of the people, have been driven from their homes, and a darkness verily gloomy and disheartening has settled on the Churches.[fn-19-P1954_537659:639-nf] The terror of universal ruin is already imminent, and yet their mutual rivalry is so unbounded as to blunt all sense of danger. Individual hatred is of more importance than the general and common warfare, for men by whom the immediate gratification of ambition is esteemed more highly than the rewards that await us in a time to come, prefer the glory of getting the better of their opponents to securing the common welfare of mankind. So all men alike, each as best he can, lift the hand of murder against one another. Harsh rises the cry of the combatants encountering one another in dispute; already all the Church is almost full of the inarticulate screams, the unintelligible noises, rising from the ceaseless agitations that divert the right rule of the doctrine of true religion, now in the direction of excess, now in that of defect. On the one hand are they who confound the Persons and are carried away into Judaism;[fn-19-P1955_538607:640-nf] on the other hand are they that, through the opposition of the natures, pass into heathenism.[fn-19-P1956_538722:641-nf] Between these opposite parties inspired Scripture is powerless to mediate; the traditions of the apostles cannot suggest terms of arbitration. Plain speaking is fatal to friendship, and disagreement in opinion all the ground that is wanted for a quarrel. No oaths of confederacy are so efficacious in keeping men true to sedition as their likeness in error. Every one is a theologue though he have his soul branded with more spots than can be counted. The result is that innovators find a plentiful supply of men ripe for faction, while self-appointed scions of the house of place-hunters[fn-19-P1957_539516:642-nf] reject the government[fn-19-P1958_540212:643-nf] of the Holy Spirit and divide the chief dignities of the Churches. The institutions of the Gospel have now everywhere been thrown into confusion by want of discipline; there is an indescribable pushing for the chief places while every self-advertiser tries to force himself into high office. The result of this lust for ordering is that our people are in a state of wild confusion for lack of being ordered;[fn-19-P1959_540889:644-nf] the exhortations of those in authority are rendered wholly purposeless and void, because there is not a man but, out of his ignorant impudence, thinks that it is just as much his duty to give orders to other people, as it is to obey any one else.","index":"194","references":[{"fn":"19","code":"P1949_532879","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"2 Cor.

Hence merciless and sour sit the judges of the erring; unfeeling and hostile are the critics of the well disposed.
