But since I have been disappointed on both occasions, I determined to write and beg that you would deign to visit me; for I think it is but right and proper that the young man should come to the old. Furthermore, at our meeting, I would make you a tender of my advice, touching your negotiations with certain at Caesarea: a right conclusion of the matter calls for my intervention. If agreeable then, do not be backward in coming to me.","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"60","code":"P6074_1911051","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"A district in Armenia Minor. Ramsay, Hist. Geog.
