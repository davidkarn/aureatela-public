I scarcely know how to treat so shifty, and, to judge from the evidence, so desperate a character. When summoned before the court, he fails to appear; and if he does attend, he is gifted with such volubility of words and oaths, that I think myself well off to be quickly rid of him. I have often known him twist round his accusations upon his accusers. In a word, there is no creature living upon earth so subtile and versatile in villainy. A slight acquaintance with him suffices to prove this. Why then do you appeal to me ? Why not at once bring yourselves to submit to his ill-treatment, as to a visitation of God's anger?","index":"3","references":[]},{"text":"At the same time you must not be contaminated by contact with wickedness.","index":"4","references":[]},{"text":"I enjoin therefore that he and all his household be forbidden the services of the Church, and all other communion with her ministers.
