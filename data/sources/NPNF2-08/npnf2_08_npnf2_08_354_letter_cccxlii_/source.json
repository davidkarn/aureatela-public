I have even heard it said about roses by some one, perhaps in jest, or, it may be, even in earnest, that nature has furnished the bloom with those delicate thorns, like stings of love to lovers, to excite those who pluck them to intenser longing by these ingeniously adapted pricks.[fn-65-P6508_1960613:1-nf] But what do I mean by this introduction of the rose into my letter? You do not need telling, when you remember your own letter. It had indeed the bloom of the rose, and, by its fair speech, opened out all spring to me; but it was bethorned with certain fault findings and charges against me. But even the thorn of your words is delightful to me, for it enkindles in me a greater longing for your friendship.","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"65","code":"P6508_1960613","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"ms. vary between e'nplh/ktoij, e'nple/ktoij, a'plh/ktoij, a'pra/ktoij.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"","index":"4","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"5","references":[]}]}]}
