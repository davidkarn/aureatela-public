If, to Jeremiah, it seemed that those whose bodies had been wounded in war, were worthy of innumerable lamentations, what shall be said of such a disaster of souls? \"My slain men,\" it is said, \"are not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle.\"[fn-32-P3255_1068255:3-nf] But I am bewailing the sting of the real death, the grievousness of sin and the fiery darts of the wicked one, which have savagely set on fire souls as well as bodies. Truly God's laws would groan aloud on seeing so great a pollution on the earth. They have pronounced their prohibition of old \"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife\";[fn-32-P3256_1068610:4-nf] and through the holy gospels they say that \"Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery already with her in his heart.\"[fn-32-P3257_1068774:5-nf] Now they see the bride of the Lord herself, whose head is Christ, boldly committing adultery.[fn-32-P3258_1068884:6-nf] So too would groan the companies[fn-32-P3259_1068945:7-nf] of the Saints. Phinehas, the zealous, because he can now no more take his spear into his hands and avenge the outrage on the bodies; and John the Baptist, because he cannot quit the realms above, as in his life he left the wilderness, to hasten to convict iniquity, and if he must suffer for the deed, rather lose his head than his freedom to speak. But, peradventure, like the blessed Abel, he too though dead yet speaks to us,[fn-32-P3260_1069439:8-nf] and now exclaims, more loudly than John of old concerning Herodias. \"It is not lawful for thee to have her.\"[fn-32-P3261_1069567:9-nf] For even if the body of John in obedience to the law of nature has received the sentence of God, and his tongue is silent, yet \"the word of God is not bound.\"[fn-32-P3262_1069744:10-nf] John, when he saw the wedlock of a fellow servant set at nought, was bold to rebuke even to the death: how would he feel on seeing such an outrage wreaked on the marriage chamber of the Lord?","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"32","code":"P3254_1067808","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"Jer. ix. 1.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"32","code":"P3255_1068255","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"Is. xxii. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":22,"verses":[2]}]},{"fn":"32","code":"P3256_1068610","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"Deut. v. 21.","bible_refs":[{"book":"deuteronomy","chapter":5,"verses":[21]}]},{"fn":"32","code":"P3257_1068774","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"Matt. v. 28.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":5,"verses":[28]}]},{"fn":"32","code":"P3258_1068884","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"cf.

You have flung away the yoke of that divine union; you have fled from the undefiled chamber of the true King; you have shamefully fallen into this disgraceful and impious corruption; and now that you cannot avoid this painful charge, and have no means or device to conceal your trouble, you rush into insolence. The wicked man after falling into a pit of iniquity always begins to despise, and you are denying your actual covenant with the true bridegroom; you say that you are not a virgin, and made no promise, although you have undertaken and publicly professed many pledges of virginity. Remember the good profession which you witnessed[fn-32-P3264_1070598:11-nf] before God, angels, and men. Remember the hallowed intercourse, the sacred company of virgins, the assembly of the Lord, the Church of the holy. Remember your grandmother, grown old in Christ, still youthful and vigorous in virtue; and your mother vying with her in the Lord, and striving to break with ordinary life in strange and unwonted toils; remember your sister, who copies their doings, nay, endeavours to surpass them, and goes beyond the good deeds of her fathers in her virgin graces, and earnestly challenges by word and deed you her sister, as she thinks, to like efforts, while she earnestly prays that your virginity be preserved.[fn-32-P3265_1071268:12-nf] All these call to mind, and your holy service of God with them, your life spiritual, though in the flesh; your conversation heavenly, though on earth. Remember days of calm, nights lighted up, spiritual songs, sweet music of psalms, saintly prayers, a bed pure and undefiled, procession of virgins, and moderate fare.[fn-32-P3266_1071729:13-nf] What has become of your grave appearance, your gracious demeanour, your plain dress, meet for a virgin, the beautiful blush of modesty, the comely and bright pallor due to temperance and vigils, shining fairer than any brilliance of complexion? How often have you not prayed, perhaps with tears, that you might preserve your virginity without spot! How often have you not written to the holy men, imploring them to offer up prayers in your behalf, not that it should be your lot to marry, still less to be involved in this shameful corruption, but that you should not fall away from the Lord Jesus? How often have you received gifts from the Bridegroom? Why enumerate the honours given you for His sake by them that are His? Why tell of your fellowship with virgins, your progress with them, your being greeted by them with praises on account of virginity, eulogies of virgins, letters written as to a virgin? Now, nevertheless, at a little blast from the spirit of the air, \"that now worketh in the children of disobedience,\"[fn-32-P3267_1072779:14-nf] you have abjured all these; you have changed the honourable treasure, worth fighting for at all costs, for short-lived indulgence which does! for the moment gratify the appetite; one day you will find it more bitter than gall.","index":"4","references":[{"fn":"32","code":"P3264_1070598","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"cf. 1 Tim. vi. 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 timothy","chapter":6,"verses":[12]}]},{"fn":"32","code":"P3265_1071268","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"These words occur in the mss. after \"moderate fare,\" below, where they make no sense.

Who would not grieve over such things and say, \"How is the faithful city become an harlot?\"[fn-32-P3269_1073117:15-nf] How would not the Lord Himself say to some of those who are now walking in the spirit of Jeremiah, \"Hast thou seen what the virgin of Israel has done to me?\"[fn-32-P3270_1073290:16-nf] I betrothed her to me in trust, in purity, in righteousness, in judgment, in pity, and in mercy;[fn-32-P3271_1073412:17-nf] as I promised her through Hosea the prophet. But she loved strangers, and while I, her husband. was yet alive, she is called adulteress, and is not afraid to belong to another husband. What then says the conductor of the bride,[fn-32-P3272_1073663:18-nf] the divine and blessed Paul, both that one of old, and the later one of to-day under whose mediation and instruction you left your father's house and were united to the Lord? Might not either, in sorrow for such a trouble, say, \"The thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.\"[fn-32-P3273_1074136:19-nf] \"I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.\"[fn-32-P3274_1074244:20-nf] I was indeed ever afraid \"lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your mind should be corrupted;\"[fn-32-P3275_1074391:21-nf] wherefore by countless counter-charms I strove to control the agitation of your senses, and by countless safeguards to preserve the bride of the Lord. So I continually set forth the life of the unmarried maid, and described how \"the unmarried\" alone \"careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit.\"[fn-32-P3276_1074743:22-nf] I used to describe the high dignity of virginity, and, addressing you as a temple of God, used as it were to give wings to your zeal as I strove to lift you to Jesus. Yet through fear of evil I helped you not to fall by the words \"if any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy.\"[fn-32-P3277_1075056:23-nf] So by my prayers I tried to make you more secure, if by any means \"your body, soul, and spirit might be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.\"[fn-32-P3278_1075244:24-nf] Yet all my toil on your behalf has been in vain. Bitter to me has been the end of those sweet labours. Now I needs must groan again at that over which I ought to have rejoiced. You have been deceived by the serpent more bitterly than Eve; and not only your mind but also your body has been defiled. Even that last horror has come to pass which I shrink from saying, and yet cannot leave unsaid, for it is as a burning and blazing fire in my bones, and I am undone and cannot endure. You have taken the members of Christ and made them the members of a harlot.[fn-32-P3279_1075824:25-nf] This is an evil with which no other can be matched. This outrage in life is new. \"For pass over the Isles of Chittim and see; and send unto Chedar and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing. Hath a nation changed their gods which are yet no gods.\"[fn-32-P3280_1076107:26-nf] But the virgin has changed her glory, and her glory is in her shame. The heavens are astonished at this, and the earth is horribly afraid, saith the Lord, for the virgin has committed two evils; she has forsaken[fn-32-P3281_1076341:27-nf] Me, the true and holy Bridegroom of holy souls, and has betaken herself to an impious and lawless destroyer of body and soul alike. She has revolted from God, her Saviour, and yielded her members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity.[fn-32-P3282_1076609:28-nf] She forgot me and went after her lover[fn-32-P3283_1076670:29-nf] from whom she will get no good.","index":"5","references":[{"fn":"32","code":"P3269_1073117","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"Is. i 21.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"32","code":"P3270_1073290","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"cf.
