I admire your zeal in the matter, and I pray God that your choice of good things may be persistent, and that, advancing in knowledge and good works, you may be made perfect. But I have no wish to leave behind me a treatise on the Faith, or to write various creeds, and so I have declined to send what you asked.[fn-45-P4582_1429207:3-nf] You seem to me to be surrounded by the din of your men there, idle fellows, who say certain things to calumniate me, with the ideathat they will improve their own position by lying disgracefully against me.[fn-45-P4583_1429557:4-nf] The past shews what they are, trod future experience will shew them in still plainer colours. I, however, call on all who trust in Christ not to busy themselves in opposition to the ancient faith, but, as we believe, so to be baptized, and, as we are baptized, so to offer the doxology.[fn-45-P4584_1429971:5-nf] It is enough for us to confess those names which we have received from Holy Scripture. and to shun all innovation about them. Our salvation does not lie in the invention of modes of address, but in the sound confession of the Godhead in which we have professed our faith.","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"45","code":"P4582_1429207","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"But what Basil declined to do at the prompting of Magnenianus, he shortly afterwards did for Amphilochius, and wrote the De Spiritu Sancto.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"45","code":"P4583_1429557","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"Maran (V.
