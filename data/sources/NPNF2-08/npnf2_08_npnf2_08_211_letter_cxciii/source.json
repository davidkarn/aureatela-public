But as to liberty of life the birds are almost as far ahead of me as they are in the being able to fly. In the first place I have been detained by certain worldly business; then I have been so wasted by constant and violent attacks of fever that there does seem something thinner even than I was,-I am thinner than ever. Besides all this, bouts of quartan ague have gone on for more than twenty turns. Now I do seem to be free from fever, but I am in such a feeble state that I am no stronger than a cobweb. Hence the shortest journey is too far for me, and every breath of wind is more dangerous to me than big waves to those at sea. I have no alternative but to hide in my hut and wait for spring, if only I can last out so long, and am not carried off beforehand[fn-48-P4827_1503901:2-nf] by the internal malady of which I am never rid. If the Lord saves me with His mighty hand, I shall gladly betake myself to your remote region, and gladly embrace a friend so dear. Only pray that my life may be ordered as may be best for my soul's good.","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"48","code":"P4827_1503901","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"psodiarpasqw=men with two mss. prodiama/otoiuen has better authority, but is bad Greek, and makes worse sense.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"","index":"4","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"5","references":[]}]}]}
