The interest which you have shewn in the affairs of the Isaurian Church is only what might have been expected from that zeal and propriety of conduct which so continually rouses my admiration of you. The most careless observer must at once perceive that it is in all respects more advantageous for care and anxiety to be divided among several bishops. This has not escaped your observation, and you have done well in noting, and in acquainting me with, the position of affairs. But it is not easy to find fit men. While, then, we are desirous of having the credit that comes of numbers, and cause God's Church to be more effectively administered by more officers, let us be careful lest we unwittingly bring the word into contempt on account of the unsatisfactory character of the men who are called to office, and accustom the laity to indifference. You yourself know well that the conduct of the governed is commonly of a piece with that of those who are set over them. Perhaps therefore it might be better to appoint one well approved man, though even this may not be an easy matter, to the supervision of the whole city, and entrust him with the management of details on his own responsibility. Only let him be a servant of God, \"a workman that needeth not to be ashamed,\"[fn-47-P4789_1494930:3-nf] not \"looking on his own things,\"[fn-47-P4790_1494981:4-nf] but on the things of the most, \"that they be saved.\"[fn-47-P4791_1495050:5-nf] If he finds himself overweighted with responsibility, he will associate other labourers for the harvest with himself. If only we can find such a man, I own that I think the one worth many, and the ordering of the cure of souls in this way likely to be attended at once with more advantage to the Churches and with less risk to us. If, however, this course prove difficult, let us first do our best to appoint superintendents[fn-47-P4792_1495495:6-nf] to the small townships or villages which have of old been episcopal sees. Then afterwards we will appoint once more the [bishop] of the city. Unless we take this course the man appointed may prove a hindrance to subsequent administration. and from his wish to rule over a larger diocese, and his refusal to accept the ordination of the bishops, we may find ourselves suddenly involved in a domestic quarrel. If this course is difficult, and time does not allow, see to it that the Isaurian bishop is strictly kept within his own bounds by ordaining some of his immediate neighbours. In the future it will be reserved for us to give to the rest bishops at the proper season, after we have carefully examined those whom we ourselves may judge to be most fit.","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"47","code":"P4789_1494930","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"2 Tim. ii. 15.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 timothy","chapter":2,"verses":[15]}]},{"fn":"47","code":"P4790_1494981","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"Phil. ii. 4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"philippians","chapter":2,"verses":[4]}]},{"fn":"47","code":"P4791_1495050","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"1 Thess. ii. 16.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 thessalonians","chapter":2,"verses":[16]}]},{"fn":"47","code":"P4792_1495495","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"proi!stame/nouj.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"2.
