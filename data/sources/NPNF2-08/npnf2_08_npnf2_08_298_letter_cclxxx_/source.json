He is the bearer of this letter, and he stands to me in the place of a son. Your favour is all that he requires for the fulfilment of Iris wishes. Deign therefore to receive, at the hands of the aforesaid bearer, my letter in furtherance of his plea. I pray you to give him an opportunity of explaining his affairs at an interview with those in a position to help him. So by your direction shall he quickly obtain his desires; while I shall have occasion for boasting that by God's favour I have found a champion who regards the entreaties of my friends as personal claims to his protection.","index":"4","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"5","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"6","references":[]}]}]}
