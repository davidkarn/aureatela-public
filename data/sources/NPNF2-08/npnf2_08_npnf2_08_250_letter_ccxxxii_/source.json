And when symbols of the feast are brought, what can I call it but a feast of feasts, as the old law used to speak of Sabbath of Sabbaths? I thank the Lord that you are quite well, and that you have celebrated the commemoration of the economy of salvation[fn-54-P5437_1712624:2-nf] in a Church at peace. I have been disturbed by some troubles; and have not been without distress from the fact of my God-beloved brother being in exile. Pray for him that God may one day grant him to see his Church healed from the woulds of heretical bites. Do come to see me while I am yet upon this earth. Act in accordance with your own wishes and with my most earnest prayers. I may be allowed to be astonished at the meaning of your blessings, inasmuch as you have mysteriously wished me a vigorous old age. By your lamps[fn-54-P5438_1713197:3-nf] you rouse me to nightly toil; and by your sweet meats you seem to pledge yourself securely that all my body is in good case. But there is no munching for me at my time of life, for my teeth have long ago been worn away by time and bad health. As to what you have asked me there are some replies in the document I send you, written to the best of my ability, and as opportunity has allowed.","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"54","code":"P5437_1712624","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"i.e the incarnation. cf. pp. 7 and 12, n.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"54","code":"P5438_1713197","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"The reading of the Ben ed. is lamphnw=n.
