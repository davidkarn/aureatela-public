I have learnt to know one who proves that even in a soldier's life it is possible to preserve the perfection of love to God,[fn-39-P3909_1263188:2-nf] and that we must mark a Christian not by the style of his dress, but by the disposition of his soul. It was a great delight to me to meet you; and now, whenever I remember you, I feel very glad. Play the man; be strong; strive to nourish and multiply love to God, that there may be given you by Him yet greater boons of blessing. I need no further proof that you remember me; I have evidence in what you have done.
