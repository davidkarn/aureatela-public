However, where friendship is involved, to be defeated is in my opinion to win, and so I am quite ready to gave you precedence, and retire from the contest as to which should maintain his own opinion. I have been the first to betake myself to writing, because I know that \"charity beareth all things ... endureth all things ... seeketh not her own\" and so \"never faileth.\"[fn-35-P3509_1143276:3-nf] He who subjects himself to his neighbour in love can never be humiliated.

If I were not to make as strenuous efforts on behalf of the Churches as the opponents of sound doctrine make to subvert and utterly destroy them, you may be quite sure that there is nothing to prevent the truth from being swept away and destroyed by its enemies, and my being involved in the condemnation, for not shewing all possible anxiety for the unity of the Churches, with all zeal and eagerness in mutual unanimity and godly agreement. I exhort you then, drive out of your mind the idea that you need communion with no one else. To cut one's self off from connexion with the brethren is not the mark of one who is walking by love, nor yet the fulfilling of the commandment of Christ. At the same time I do wish you, with all your good intentions, to take into account that the calamities of the war which are now all round about us[fn-35-P3511_1144578:5-nf] may one day be at our own doors, and if we too, like all the rest, have oar share of outrage, we shall not find any even to sympathise with us, because in the hour of our prosperity we refused to give our share of sympathy to the wronged.","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"35","code":"P3509_1143276","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"1 Cor. xiii. 7 and 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":13,"verses":[7]}]},{"fn":"35","code":"P3510_1143480","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"cf.
