And regard not such a wish as conventional merely, but as expressing my sincere conviction of the value of your utterances. Whom could I honour above Nectarius-known to me from his earliest days as a child of fairest promise, who now through the exercise of every virtue has reached a position of the highest eminence?-So much so, that of all my friends the dearest is the bearer of your letter.","index":"3","references":[]},{"text":"Touching the election of those set over districts,[fn-61-P6187_1926520:2-nf] God forbid that I should do anything for the gratification of man, through listening to importunities or yielding to fear. In that case I should be not a steward. but a huckster, battering the gift of God for the favour of man. But seeing that votes are given but by mortals, who can only bear such testimony as they do from outward appearances, while the choice of fit persons is committed in all humility to Him Who knows the secrets of the heart, haply it is best for everybody, when he has tendered the evidence of his vote, to abstain from all heat and contention, as though some self-interest were involved in the testimony, and to pray to God that what is advantageous may not remain unknown. Thus the result is no longer attributable to man, but a cause for thankfulness to God. For these things, if they be of man, cannot be said to be; but are pretence only, altogether void of reality.","index":"4","references":[{"fn":"61","code":"P6187_1926520","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"On the word summopi/aj the Ben. note is: \"Hac voce non designatur tota diocesis, sed certos quidam pagorum numerus chorepiscopo commissus, ut patet ex epsit. /foreign> cxlii.,\" lq.v., \"erat autem chorepiscoporum sedes insigni alieui affixa pago, cui alli pagi attribuebantur.

Were it not better for each to take them from himself ? But if they are the gift of God, we ought to pray and not to grieve. And in our prayer we should not seek oar own will, but leave it to God who disposes for the best.","index":"7","references":[]},{"text":"Now may the holy God keep from your home all taste of sorrow; and grant to you and to your family a life exempt from harm and sickness.","index":"8","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"9","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"10","references":[]}]}]}
