Armitage Robinson's translation here follows was discovered by the French Archaeological Mission, Cairo, in a grave (supposed to be a monk's) in an ancient cemetery at Akhm√Æm (Panopolis), in Upper Egypt, in 1886. It was published in 1892 under the care of M. Bouriant in vol. ix., fasc. i., of the Memoirs of the French Archaeological Mission at Cairo. The same parchment which contained this fragment also contained a fragment of the Revelation of Peter and a fragment of the Book of Enoch in Greek. The parchment codex is assigned to a date between the eighth and the twelfth century.","index":"2","references":[]},{"text":"Before this discovery the following is all that was known of the Gospel of Peter: 1. Serapion, Bishop of Antioch 190-203, writing to the church at Rhossus, says (Eusebius, H. E., vi., 12, 2): \"We, brethren, receive Peter and the other Apostles even as Christ; but the writings that go falsely by their names we, in our experience, reject, knowing that such things as these we never received. When I was with you I supposed you all to be attached to the right faith; and so without going through the gospel put forward under Peter's name, I said, `If this is all that makes your petty quarrel,[fn-1-P133_8259:1-nf] why then let it be read.' But now that I have learned from information given me that their mind was lurking in some hole of heresy, I will make a point of coming to you again: so, brethren, expect me speedily. Knowing then, brethren, of what kind of heresy was Marcion-[Here follows a sentence where the text is faulty.]... From others who used this very gospel-I mean from the successors of those who started it, whom we call Docetae; for most of its ideas are of their school-from them, I say, I borrowed it, and was able to go through it, and to find that most of it belonged to the right teaching of the Saviour, but some things were additions.\" From this we learn that a, Gospel of Peter was in use in the church of Rhossus in the end of the second century, but that controversy had arisen as to its character, which, on a careful examination, Serapion condemned.","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"1","code":"P133_8259","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Parexein mikroyian, perhaps \"causes you ill-feeling.\" The translation of Serapion's letter with this note is taken from Mr. Armitage Robinson's edition of the gospel.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"2. Origen (_ 253 a.d.), in commenting on Matthew 10:17, says: \"But, proceeding on the tradition that is recorded in the Gospel according to Peter or in the Book of James, they say that there are certain brothers of Jesus, the sons of Joseph by a former wife, who lived with him before Mary.\"","index":"4","references":[]},{"text":"3. Eusebius (H. E., iii., 3, 2) says. \"As to that work, however, which is ascribed to him, called The Acts,  and The Gospel according to Peter,  and that called The Preaching and the Revelations of Peter,  we know nothing of their being handed down as Catholic writings; since neither among the ancient nor the ecclesiastical writers of our own day has there been one that has appealed to testimony taken from them.\" And in H. E., iii., 25, 6 sq., he includes the Gospel of Peter among the forged heretical gospels-\" those that are adduced by the heretics under the name of the apostles, ... of which no one of those writers in the ecclesiastical succession has condescended to make any mention in his works; and, indeed, the character of the style itself is very different from that of the apostles; and the sentiments, and the purport of those things that are advanced in them, deviating as far as possible from sound orthodoxy, evidently proves they are the fictions of heretical men; whence they are not only to be ranked among the spurious writings, but are to be rejected as altogether absurd and impious.\" It is, however, uncertain whether Eusebius himself was acquainted with the Gospel of Peter.","index":"5","references":[]},{"text":"4.

He is certainly influenced by views which are foreign to these gospels, and which are known from other quarters in early Christian literature. As between the Synoptists and the Fourth Gospel, the narrator is generally more closely akin both in matter and in manner to the Synoptists, but he agrees with the author of the Fourth Gospel in regard to the chronology of the crucifixion and several of the events at the cross, and in his general attitude towards the Jews and Pilate. With regard to the last two points, the Petrine Gospel seems to present a later and more exaggerated form of the tendency perceptible in the Johannine, and fully worked out in the Acts of Pilate, to blame the Jews and exculpate Pilate.","index":"46","references":[]},{"text":"Of the new features in this fragment some are at least liable to a Docetic interpretation, e.g., the silence on the cross \"as though he had no pain\" (sec. 4), the cry, \"My power, my power\" (sec. 5), and \"he was taken up\" (sec. 5). This fact was recognised in subsequent times and condemned this gospel in the eye of the church. The date of the work is variously fixed by different scholars; Harnack assigns it to the first quarter of the second century, while Mr. Armitage Robinson and other scholars place it later.","index":"47","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"48","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"49","references":[]}]}]}
