And there are indeed among\nmusical sounds some accordant and others discordant. But the Evangelic Scripture is familiar with the\nname as applied to musical matters in the passage, \"He heard a symphony and dancing.\"[fn-85-P8525_1867768:3-nf] For it was fitting that when the son who had been\nlost and found came by penitence into concord with his father a symphony should be heard on the\noccasion of the joyous mirth of the house. But the wicked Laban was not acquainted with the word\nsymphony in his saying to Jacob, \"And if thou hadst told me I would have sent thee away with mirth\nand with music and with drums and a harp.\"[fn-85-P8526_1868169:4-nf]\nBut akin to the symphony of this nature is that which is written in the second Book of Kings when\n\"the brethren of Aminadab went before the ark, and David and his son played before the Lord on\ninstruments artistically fitted with might and with songs; \"[fn-85-P8527_1868441:5-nf] for the instruments thus fitted with might and\nwith songs, had in themselves the musical symphony which is so powerful that when two only, bring\nalong with the symphony which has relation to the music that is divine and spiritual, a request to\nthe Father in heaven about anything whatsoever, the Father grants the request to those who ask along\nwith the symphony on earth,-which is most miraculous,-those things which those who have made the\nsymphony spoken of may have asked. So also I understand the apostolic saying \"Defraud ye not one the\nother except it be by agreement for a season that ye may give yourselves unto prayer.\"[fn-85-P8528_1869091:6-nf] For since the word harmony is applied to those who\nmarry according to God in the passage from Proverbs which is as follows: \"Fathers will divide their\nhouse and substance to their sons, but from God the woman is married to the man,\"[fn-85-P8529_1869342:7-nf] it is a logical consequence of the harmony being\nfrom God, that the name and the deed should enjoy the agreement with a view to prayer, as is\nindicated in the word, \"unless it be by agreement.\"[fn-85-P8530_1869565:8-nf] Then the Word repeating that the agreeing of two\non the earth is the same thing as the agreeing with Christ, adds, \"For where two or three are\ngathered together in My name.\"[fn-85-P8531_1869757:9-nf] Therefore\nthe two or three who are gathered together in the name of Christ are those who are in agreement on\nearth, not two only but sometimes also three. But he who has the power will consider whether this\nagreement and a congregation of this sort in the midst of which Christ is, can be found in more,\nsince \"narrow and straightened is the way that leadeth unto life, and few be they that find\nit.\"[fn-85-P8532_1870180:10-nf] But perhaps also not even few but two\nor three make a symphony as Peter and James and John, to whom as making a symphony the Word of God\nshowed His own glory. But two made a symphony, Paul and Sosthenes, when writing the first Epistle to\nthe Corinthians;[fn-85-P8533_1870455:11-nf] and after this Paul and\nTimothy when sending the second Epistle to the same.[fn-85-P8534_1870550:12-nf] And even three made a symphony when Paul and\nSilvanus and Timothy gave instruction by letter to the Thessalonians.[fn-85-P8535_1870683:13-nf] But if it be necessary also from the ancient\nScriptures to bring forward the three who made a symphony on earth, so that the Word was in the midst\nof them making them one, attend to the superscription of the Psalms, as for example to that of the\nforty-first, which is as follows: \"Unto the end, unto understanding, for the sons of Korah.\"[fn-85-P8536_1871042:14-nf] For though there were three sons of Korah whose\nnames we find in the Book of Exodus,[fn-85-P8537_1871140:15-nf] Aser,\nwhich is, by interpretation, \"instruction,\" and the second Elkana, which is translated, \"possession\nof God,\" and the third Abiasaph, which in the Greek tongue might be rendered, \"congregation of the\nfather,\" yet the prophecies were not divided but were both spoken and written by one spirit, and one\nvoice, and one soul, which wrought with true harmony, and the three speak as one, \"As the heart\npanteth after the springs of the water, so panteth my soul alter thee, O God.\"[fn-85-P8538_1871640:16-nf] But also they say in the plural in the\nforty-fourth Psalm, \"O God, we have heard with our ears.\"[fn-85-P8539_1871755:17-nf] But if you wish still further to see those who\nare making symphony on earth look to those who heard the exhortation, \"that ye may be perfected\ntogether in the same mind and in the same judgment.\"[fn-85-P8540_1871969:18-nf] and who strove after the goal, \"the soul and the\nheart of all the believers were one.\"[fn-85-P8541_1872075:19-nf] who\nhave become such, if it be possible for such a condition to be found in more than two or three, that\nthere is no discord between them, just as there is no discord between the strings of the ten-stringed\npsaltery with each other. But they were not in symphony in earth who said, \"I am of Paul, and I of\nApollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ,\"[fn-85-P8542_1872443:20-nf] but there were schisms among them, upon the\ndissolution of which they were gathered together in company with the spirit in Paul, with the power\nof the Lord Jesus Christ,[fn-85-P8543_1872632:21-nf] that they might\nno longer \"bite and devour one another so that they were consumed by one another; \"[fn-85-P8544_1872749:22-nf] for discord consumes, as concord brings together,\nand admits[fn-85-P8545_1872827:23-nf] the Son of God who comes in the\nmidst of those who have become at concord. And strictly, indeed, concord takes place in two things\ngeneric, through the perfecting together, as the Apostle has called it, of the same mind by an\nintellectual grasp of the same opinions, and through the perfecting together of the same judgment, by\na like way of living. But if whenever two of us agree on earth as touching anything that they shall\nask, it shall be done for them of the Father of Jesus who is in heaven,[fn-85-P8546_1873392:24-nf] plainly when this is not done for them of the\nFather in heaven as touching anything that they shall ask, there the two have not been in agreement\non earth; and this is the cause why we are not heard when we pray, that we do not agree with one\nanother on earth, neither in opinions nor in life. But further also if we are the body of Christ and\nGod hath set the members each one of them in the body that the members may have the same care one for\nanother, and may agree with one another, and when one member suffers, all the members suffer with it,\nand if one be glorified, they rejoice with it,[fn-85-P8547_1874009:25-nf] we ought to practise the symphony which springs\nfrom the divine music, that when we are gathered together in the name of Christ, He may be in the\nmidst of us, the Word of God, and the Wisdom of God, and His Power.[fn-85-P8548_1874256:26-nf] ","index":"29","references":[{"fn":"85","code":"P8523_1867362","folder":"ANF-10","text":"sumfqnhswsin.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8524_1867458","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xviii. 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":18,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8525_1867768","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Luke xv. 25.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","verses":[{"chapter":15,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8526_1868169","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Gen. xxxi. 27.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","verses":[{"chapter":31,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8527_1868441","folder":"ANF-10","text":"2 Sam. vi. 4, 5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 samuel","verses":[{"chapter":6,"verses":[1,2,3,4,5]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8528_1869091","folder":"ANF-10","text":"1 Cor. vii. 5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","verses":[{"chapter":7,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8529_1869342","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Prov. xix. 14, armozetai.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8530_1869565","folder":"ANF-10","text":"1 Cor. vii. 5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","verses":[{"chapter":7,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8531_1869757","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xviii. 20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":18,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8532_1870180","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. vii. 14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":7,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8533_1870455","folder":"ANF-10","text":"1 Cor. i. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","verses":[{"chapter":1,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8534_1870550","folder":"ANF-10","text":"2 Cor. i. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","verses":[{"chapter":1,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8535_1870683","folder":"ANF-10","text":"1 Thess. i. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 thessalonians","verses":[{"chapter":1,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8536_1871042","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Ps xlii","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8537_1871140","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Exod. vi. 24.","bible_refs":[{"book":"exodus","verses":[{"chapter":6,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8538_1871640","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Ps. xlii. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","verses":[{"chapter":42,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8539_1871755","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Ps. xliv. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","verses":[{"chapter":44,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8540_1871969","folder":"ANF-10","text":"1 Cor. i. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","verses":[{"chapter":1,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8541_1872075","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Acts iv. 32.","bible_refs":[{"book":"the acts","verses":[{"chapter":4,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8542_1872443","folder":"ANF-10","text":"1 Cor. i. 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","verses":[{"chapter":1,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8543_1872632","folder":"ANF-10","text":"1 Cor. v. 4","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8544_1872749","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Gal. v. 15.","bible_refs":[{"book":"galatians","verses":[{"chapter":5,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8545_1872827","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Or reading xwrizei, following the Vetus Inter, keeps apart.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8546_1873392","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xviii. 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":18,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8547_1874009","folder":"ANF-10","text":"1 Cor. xii. 25, 18, 25, 26.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","verses":[{"chapter":12,"verses":[1]},{"chapter":18,"verses":[1]},{"chapter":0,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8548_1874256","folder":"ANF-10","text":"1 Cor. i. 24.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","verses":[{"chapter":1,"verses":[1]}]}]}]},{"text":"\n2.

But you might\nsay that he who has sinned in such wise, whether as against Peter his brother, or as against Peter,\nagainst whom the gates of Hades do not prevail, is by sins of this kind in the smaller number of the\nsin, but according to sins still worse is in the number which has no forgiveness of sins.","index":"37","references":[{"fn":"85","code":"P8569_1878883","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xviii. 21.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":18,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8570_1879635","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Gen. iv. 23.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","verses":[{"chapter":4,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8571_1880776","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xviii. 22.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":18,"verses":[1]}]}]}]},{"text":"\n6.

And this the parable wishes to\nteach us by representing that even when forgiveness has been granted by God to us of the sins in\nrespect of which we have received remission, exaction will be demanded even after the remission,\nunless we forgive the sins of those who have wronged us, so that there is no longer left in us the\nleast remembrance of the wrong that was done. but the whole heart, assisted by the spirit of\nforgetfulness of wrongs, which is no common virtue, forgives him who has wronged us those things\nwhich have been wickedly done against any of us by him, even treacherously.But next to the general\nconception of the parable, it is right to examine the whole of it more simply according to the\nletter, so that he who advances with care to the right investigation of each detail of the things\npreviously written may derive profit from the examination of what is said. Now there is, as is\nprobable, an interpretation, transcendental and hard to trace, as it is somewhat mystical, according\nto which, after the analogy of the parables which are interpreted by the Evangelists, one would\ninvestigate each of the details in this; as, for example, who the king was, and who the servants\nwere, and what was the beginning of his making a reckoning, and who was the one debtor who owed many\ntalents, and who was his wife and who his children, and what were the \"all things\" spoken of besides\nthose which the king ordered to be sold in order that the debt might be paid out of his belongings,\nand what was meant by the going out of the man who had been forgiven the many talents, and who was\nthe one of the servants who was found and was a debtor not to the householder, but to the man who had\nbeen forgiven, and what is meant by the number of the hundred pence, and what by the word, \"He took\nhim by the throat saying, Pay what thou owest,\" and what is the prison into which he who had been\nforgiven all the talents went out and cast his fellow-servant, and who were the fellow-servants who\nwere grieved and told the lord all that had been done, and who were the tormentors to whom he who had\ncast his fellow-servant into prison was delivered, and how he who was delivered to the tormentors\npaid all that was due, so that he no longer owed anything.[fn-85-P8576_1884476:39-nf] But it is probable also that some other things\ncould be added to the number by a more competent investigator, the exposition and interpretation of\nwhich I think to be beyond the power of man, and requiring the Spirit of Christ who spoke them in\norder that Christ may be understood as He spoke; for as \"no one among men knows the things of the\nman, save the spirit which is in him,\" and \"no one knows the things of God, save the Spirit of\nGod,\"[fn-85-P8577_1884946:40-nf] so no one knows after God the things\nspoken by Christ in proverbs and parables save the Spirit of Christ, in which he who participates in\nChrist not only so far as He is Spirit, but in Christ as He is Wisdom, as He is Word, would behold\nthe things which were revealed to him in this passage. But with regard to the interpretation of the\nloftiest type, we make no profession; nor on the other hand with the assistance of Christ who is the\nWisdom of God do we despair of apprehending the things signified in the parable; but whether it shall\nbe the case that such things shall be dictated to us in connection with this Scripture or not, may\nGod in Christ suggest the doing of that which is pleasing to Him, if only there be granted to us also\nconcerning these things, the word of wisdom which is given from God through the Spirit, and the word\nof knowledge which is supplied according to the Spirit.[fn-85-P8578_1885864:41-nf] ","index":"39","references":[{"fn":"85","code":"P8575_1881883","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xviii. 23.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":18,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8576_1884476","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xviii. 23, 34.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":18,"verses":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8577_1884946","folder":"ANF-10","text":"1 Cor. ii. 11.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","verses":[{"chapter":2,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8578_1885864","folder":"ANF-10","text":"i Cor. xii. 8.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"\n7.

For He is the King of the\nheavens, and as He is absolute Wisdom and absolute Righteousness and absolute Truth, is He not so\nalso absolute Kingdom? But it is not a kingdom of any of those below, nor of a part of those above,\nbut of all the things above, which were called heavens. But if you enquire into the meaning of the\nwords, \"Theirs is the kingdom of heaven,\"[fn-85-P8583_1886495:43-nf]\nyou may say that Christ is theirs in so far as He is absolute Kingdom, reigning in every thought of\nthe man who is no longer under the reign of sin which reigns in the mortal body of those who have\nsubjected themselves to it.[fn-85-P8584_1886738:44-nf] And if I say,\nreigning in every thought, I mean something like this, reigning as Righteousness and Wisdom and Truth\nand the rest of the virtues in him who has become a heaven, because of bearing the image of the\nheavenly, and in every power, whether angelic, or the rest that are named saints, not only in this\nage, but also in that which is to come, and who are worthy of a kingdom of such a kind. Accordingly\nthis kingdom of heaven (when it was made \"in the likeness of sinful flesh,\"[fn-85-P8585_1887243:45-nf] that for sin it might condemn sin, when God made\n\"Him who knew no sin to be sin on behalf of us,\"[fn-85-P8586_1887359:46-nf] who bear the body of our sin), is likened to a\ncertain king who is understood in relation to Jesus being united to Him, if we may dare so to speak,\nhaving more capacity towards being united and becoming entirely one with the \"First-born of all\ncreation,\"[fn-85-P8587_1887633:47-nf] than he, who, being joined to\nthe Lord, becomes one spirit with Him.[fn-85-P8588_1887719:48-nf] Now\nof this kingdom of the heavens which is likened unto a certain king, according to the conception of\nJesus, and is united to Him, it is said by anticipation that he wished to make a reckoning with his\nservants. But he is about to make a reckoning with them in order that it may be manifested how each\nhas employed the tried money of the householder and his rational coins. And the image in the parables\nwas indeed taken from masters who made a reckoning with their own servants; but we shall understand\nmore accurately what is signified by this part of the parable, if we fix our thought on the things\ndone by the slaves who had administered their master's goods, and who were asked to give a reckoning\nconcerning them. For each of them, receiving in different measure from his master's goods, has used\nthem either for that which was right so as to increase the goods of his master. or consumed it\nriotously on things which he ought not, and spent profusely without judgment and without discretion\nthat which had been put into his hands. But there are those who have wisely administered these goods\nand goods so great, but have lost others, and whenever they give the reckoning when the master makes\na reckoning with them, there is gathered together how much loss each has incurred, and there is\nreckoned up how much gain each has brought, and according to the worthiness of the way in which he\nhas administered it, he is either honoured or punished, or in some cases the debt is forgiven, but in\nothers the talents are taken away. Well, then, from what has been said, let us first look at the\nrational coins and the tried money of the householder, of which one receives more and another less,\nfor according to the ability of each, to one are given five talents as he has the ability to\nadminister so many, but to another two as not being able to receive the amount of the man before him,\nand to another one as being also inferior to the second.[fn-85-P8589_1889689:49-nf] Are these, then, the only differences, or are we\nto recognize these differences in the case of certain persons of whom the Gospel goes on to speak\nwhile there are also others besides these: In other parables also are found certain persons, as the\ntwo debtors, the one who owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty;[fn-85-P8590_1890028:50-nf] but whether these had been entrusted with them\nand had administered them badly as being inferior in ability to him who had been entrusted with a\ntalent, or had received them, we have not learned; but that they owed so much, we seem to be taught\nfrom the parable. And there are found other ten servants who were each entrusted with a pound\nseparately.[fn-85-P8591_1890398:51-nf] And if any one understood the\nvaried character of the human soul and the wide differences from each other in respect of natural\naptitude, or want of aptitude for more or fewer of the virtues, and for these virtues or for those,\nperhaps he would comprehend how each soul has come with certain coins of the householder which come\nto light with the full attainment of reason, and with the attention which follows the full attainment\nof reason, and with exercise in things that are right, or with diligence and exercise in other\nthings, whether they be useful as pursuits, or in part useful and in part not useful, such as the\nopinions which are not wholly true nor wholly false.","index":"41","references":[{"fn":"85","code":"P8582_1885985","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xviii. 23.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":18,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8583_1886495","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. v. 3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":5,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8584_1886738","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Rom. vi. 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","verses":[{"chapter":6,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8585_1887243","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Rom viii. 3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","verses":[{"chapter":8,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8586_1887359","folder":"ANF-10","text":"2 Cor. v. 21.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","verses":[{"chapter":5,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8587_1887633","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Col. i. 15.","bible_refs":[{"book":"colossians","verses":[{"chapter":1,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8588_1887719","folder":"ANF-10","text":"1 Cor. vi. 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","verses":[{"chapter":6,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8589_1889689","folder":"ANF-10","text":"1 Cor. vi. 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","verses":[{"chapter":6,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8590_1890028","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Luke vii. 41.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","verses":[{"chapter":7,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"85","code":"P8591_1890398","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Luke xix. 13.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","verses":[{"chapter":19,"verses":[1]}]}]}]},{"text":"\n8.

But\nthis wicked servant, who had besought his master to have patience for his many talents, acted without\nmercy, for, having found one of his fellow-servants which owed him a hundred pence, he laid hold on\nhim and took him by the throat, saying, \"Pay if thou owest.\"[fn-86-P8629_1901233:77-nf] And did he not exhibit the very excess of\nwickedness who laid hold of his fellow-servant for a hundred pence, and took him by the throat and\ndeprived him of freedom to breathe, when he himself, for the many talents, had neither been laid hold\nof, nor seized by the throat, but at first was ordered to be sold along with his wife and children\nand all that was his own; but afterwards, when he had worshipped him, the master was moved with\ncompassion for him, and he was released and forgiven in regard to the whole of the debt. But it were\nindeed a hard task to tell according to the conception of Jesus who is the one fellow-servant who was\nfound to be owing a hundred pence, not to his own lord, but to him who owed many talents, and who are\nthe fellow-servants who saw the one taking by the throat, and the other taken, and were exceedingly\nsorry, and represented clearly unto their own lord all that had been done. But what the truth in\nthese matters is, I declare that no one can interpret unless Jesus, who explained all things to His\nown disciples privately, takes up His abode in his reason, and opens up all the treasures in the\nparable which are dark, hidden, unseen, and confirms by clear demonstrations the man whom He desires\nto illumine with the light of the knowledge of the things that are in this parable, that he may at\nonce represent who is brought to the king as the debtor of many talents, and who is the other one who\nowes to him a hundred pence, etc.; whether he can be the man of sin previously mentioned,[fn-86-P8630_1902784:78-nf] or the devil, or neither of these, but some\nother, whether a man, or some one of these under the sway of the devil; for it is a work of the\nwisdom of God to exhibit the things have have been prophesied concerning those who are in themselves\nof a certain nature, or have been made according to such and such qualities, whether among visible\npowers or also among some men, in whatever way they may have been written by the Holy Spirit. But as\nwe have not yet received the competent mind which is able to be blended with the mind of Christ, and\nwhich is capable of attaining to things so great, and which is able with the Spirit to \"search all\nthings, even the deep things of God,\"[fn-86-P8631_1903484:79-nf] we,\nforming an impression still indefinitely with regard to the matters in this passage, are of opinion\nthat the wicked servant indicated by the parable who is here represented in regard to the debt of\nmany talents, refers to some definite one.","index":"49","references":[{"fn":"86","code":"P8627_1899736","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xviii. 25.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":18,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8628_1900315","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xviii. 26.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":18,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8629_1901233","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xviii. 28.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":18,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8630_1902784","folder":"ANF-10","text":"2 Thess. ii. 3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 thessalonians","verses":[{"chapter":2,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8631_1903484","folder":"ANF-10","text":"1 Cor. ii. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","verses":[{"chapter":2,"verses":[1]}]}]}]},{"text":"\n12.

For\nif it be after the consummation, or at it at the time of the expected judgment, how are we to\nmaintain the things about him who owed a hundred pence, and was taken by the throat by the man who\nhad been forgiven the many talents? But if, before the judgment, how can we explain the reckoning\nthat was made before this by the king, with his own servants? But we ought to think in a general way\nabout every parable, the interpretation of which has not been recorded by the evangelists, even\nthough Jesus explained all things to His own disciples privately;[fn-86-P8635_1904524:80-nf] and for this reason the writers of the Gospels\nhave concealed the clear exposition of the parables, because the things signified by them were beyond\nthe power of the nature of words to express, and every solution and exposition of such parables was\nof such a kind that not even the whole world itself could contain the books that should be\nwritten[fn-86-P8636_1904890:81-nf] in relation to such parables. But\nit may happen that a fitting heart be found, and, because of its purity, able to receive the letters\nof the exposition of the parable, so that they could be written in it by the Spirit of the living\nGod. But some one will say that, perhaps, we act with impiety, who, because of the secret and\nmystical import of some of the Scriptures which are of heavenly origin, wish them to be symbolic, and\nendeavour to expound them, even though it might seem ex hypothesi that we had an accurate knowledge\nof their meaning. But to this we must say that, if there be those who have obtained the gift of\naccurate apprehension of these things, they know what they ought to do; but as for us, who\nacknowledge that we fall short of the ability to see into the depth of the things here signified,\neven though we obtain a somewhat crass perception of the things in the passage, we will say, that\nsome of the things which we seem to find after much examination and inquiry, whether by the grace of\nGod, or by the power of our own mind, we do not venture to commit to writing; but some things, for\nthe sake of our own intellectual discipline, and that of those who may chance to read them, we will\nto some extent set forth. But let these things, then, be said by way of apology, because of the depth\nof the parable; but, with regard to the question at what time the man-the king-in the parable wished\nto make a reckoning with his own servants, we will say that it seems that this takes place about the\ntime of the judgment which had been proclaimed. And this is confirmed by two parables, one at the\nclose of the Gospel before us,[fn-86-P8637_1906554:82-nf] and one\nfrom the Gospel according to Luke.[fn-86-P8638_1906620:83-nf] And not\nto prolong the discussion by quoting the very letter, as any one who wishes can take it from the\nScripture himself, we will say that the parable according to Matthew declares, \"For it is as when a\nman going into another country called his own servants, and delivered unto them his own goods, and to\none he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one talent; \"[fn-86-P8639_1907024:84-nf] then they took action with regard to that which\nhad been entrusted to them, and, after a long time, the lord of those servants cometh, and it is\nwritten in the very words, that he also makes a reckoning with them.[fn-86-P8640_1907262:85-nf] And compare the words, \"And when he began to make\na reckoning,\"[fn-86-P8641_1907346:86-nf] and consider that he called\nthe going of the householder into another country the time at which \"we are at home in the body but\nabsent from the Lord; \"[fn-86-P8642_1907520:87-nf] but his advent,\nwhen, \"after a long time the lord of those servants cometh,\"[fn-86-P8643_1907615:88-nf] the time at the consummation in the judgment; for\nafter a long time the lord of those servants cometh and makes a reckoning with them, and those things\nwhich follow take place. But the parable in Luke represents with more clearness, that \"a certain\nnobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return,\" and when going,\n\"he called ten servants, and gave to them ten pounds, and said unto them, Trade ye till I\ncome.\"[fn-86-P8644_1908080:89-nf] But the nobleman, being hated by\nhis own citizens, who sent an ambassage after him, as they did not wish him to reign over them, came\nback again, having received the kingdom, and told the servants to whom he had given the money to be\ncalled to himself that he might know what they had gained by trading. And, seeing what they had done,\nto him who had made the one pound ten pounds, rendering praise in the words, \"Well done, thou good\nservant, because thou wast found faithful in a very little,\"[fn-86-P8645_1908599:90-nf] he gives to him authority over ten cities,\nto-wit, those which were under his kingdom. And to another, who had multiplied the pound fivefold, he\ndid not render the praise which he assigned to the first, nor did he specify the word \"authority,\" as\nin the case of the first, but said to him, \"Be thou also over five cities.\"[fn-86-P8646_1908942:91-nf] But to him who had tied up the pound in a napkin,\nhe said, \"Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant; \"[fn-86-P8647_1909086:92-nf] and he said to them that stood by. Take from him\nthe pound, and give it unto him that hath the ten pounds[fn-86-P8648_1909211:93-nf] Who, then, in regard to this parable, will not\nsay that the nobleman, who goes into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return, is\nChrist, going, as it were, into another country to receive the kingdoms of this world, and the things\nin it? And those who have received the ten talents are those who have been entrusted with the\ndispensation of the Word which has been committed unto them. And His citizens who did not wish Him to\nreign over them when He was a citizen in the world in respect of His incarnation,[fn-86-P8649_1909759:94-nf] are perhaps Israel who disbelieved Him, and\nperhaps also the Gentiles who disbelieved Him.","index":"51","references":[{"fn":"86","code":"P8635_1904524","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Mark iv. 34.","bible_refs":[{"book":"mark","verses":[{"chapter":4,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8636_1904890","folder":"ANF-10","text":"John xxi. 25.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","verses":[{"chapter":21,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8637_1906554","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xxv. 14-30.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":25,"verses":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30]}]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8638_1906620","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Luke xix. 12-27.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","verses":[{"chapter":19,"verses":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27]}]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8639_1907024","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xxv. 14, 15.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":25,"verses":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]}]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8640_1907262","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xxv. 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":25,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8641_1907346","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xviii. 24.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":18,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8642_1907520","folder":"ANF-10","text":"2 Cor. v. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","verses":[{"chapter":5,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8643_1907615","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xxv. 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":25,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8644_1908080","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Luke xix. 12, 13.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","verses":[{"chapter":19,"verses":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]}]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8645_1908599","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Luke xix. 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","verses":[{"chapter":19,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8646_1908942","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Luke xix. 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","verses":[{"chapter":19,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8647_1909086","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Luke xix. 22.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","verses":[{"chapter":19,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8648_1909211","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Luke xix. 24.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","verses":[{"chapter":19,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8649_1909759","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Luke xix. 14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","verses":[{"chapter":19,"verses":[1]}]}]}]},{"text":"\n13.

Therefore, when he returned after receiving\nthe kingdom, he wished to make a reckoning with his own servants. And \"when he had begun to reckon,\nthere was brought unto him one who owed many talents,\"[fn-86-P8655_1910766:97-nf] and he was brought as to a king by those who had\nbeen appointed his ministers-I think, the angels, And perhaps he was one of those under the kingdom\nwho had been entrusted with a great administration and had not dispensed it well, but had wasted what\nhad been entrusted to him, so that he came to owe the many talents which he had lost. This very man,\nperhaps not having the means to pay, is ordered by the king to be sold along with his wife, by\nintercourse with whom he became the father of certain children. But it is no easy task to see what is\nintellectually meant by father and mother and children. What this means in point of truth God may\nknow, and whether He Himself has given insight to us or not, he who can may judge. Only this is our\nconception of the passage; that, as \"the Jerusalem which is above\" is \"the mother\"[fn-86-P8656_1911618:98-nf] of Paul and of those like unto him, so there may\nbe a mother of others after the analogy of Jerusalem, the mother, for example, of Syene in Egypt, or\nSidon, or as many cities as are named in the Scriptures. Then, as Jerusalem is \"a bride adorned for\nher husband,\"[fn-86-P8657_1911900:99-nf] Christ, so there may be\nthose mothers of certain powers who have been allotted to them as wives or brides. And as there are\ncertain children of Jerusalem, as mother, and of Christ, as father, so there would be certain\nchildren of Syene, or Memphis, or Tyre, or Sidon, and the rulers set over them. Perhaps then, too,\nthis one, the debtor of many talents who was brought to the king, has, as we have said, a wife and\nchildren, whom at first the king ordered to be sold, and also all that he had to be sold; but\nafterwards, being moved with compassion, he released him and forgave him all the debt; not, as if he\nwere ignorant of the future, but, in order that we might understand what happened, it was written\nthat he did so. Each one then of those who have, as we have said, a wife and children will render an\naccount whenever the king comes to make a reckoning, having received the kingdom and having returned;\nand each of them as a ruler of any Syene or Memphis, or Tyre or Sidon, or any like unto them, has\nalso debtors. This one, then, having been released, and having been forgiven all the debt, \"went out\nfrom the king and found one of his fellow-servants,\"[fn-86-P8658_1913083:100-nf] etc.; and, on this account, I suppose that he\ntook him by the throat, when he had gone out from the king, for unless he had gone out he would not\nhave taken his own fellow-servant by the throat. Then observe the accuracy of the Scripture, how that\nthe one fell down and \"worshipped,\" but the other fell down and did not worship but \"besought;\n\"[fn-86-P8659_1913452:101-nf] and the king being moved with\ncompassion released him and forgave him all the debt, but the servant did not wish even to pity his\nown fellow-servant; and the king before his release ordered him to be sold and what was his, while he\nwho had been forgiven cast him into prison. And observe that his fellow-servants did not bring any\naccusation or \"said,\" but \"told,\"[fn-86-P8660_1913845:102-nf] and\nthat he did not use the epithet \"wicked\" at the beginning in regard to the money lost, but reserved\nit afterwards for his action towards the fellow-servant. But mark also the moderation of the king; he\ndoes not say, You worshipped me, but You besought me; and no longer did he order him and his to be\nsold, but, what was worse, he delivered him to the tormentors, because of his wickedness.[fn-86-P8661_1914264:103-nf] But who may these be but those who have been\nappointed in the matter of punishments? But at the same time observe, because of the use made of this\nparable by adherents of heresies, that if they accuse the Creator[fn-86-P8662_1914501:104-nf] of being passionate, because of words that\ndeclare the wrath of God, they ought also to accuse this king, because that \"being wroth,\" he\ndelivered the debtor to the tormentors. But it must further be said to those whose view it is that no\none is delivered by Jesus to the tormentors,-pray, explain to us, good sirs, who is the king who\ndelivered the wicked servant to the tormentors? And let them also attend to this, \"So therefore also\nshall My heavenly Father do unto you; \"[fn-86-P8663_1915045:105-nf]\nand to the same persons also might rather be said the things in the parable of the Ten Pounds that\nthe Son of the good God said, \"Howbeit these mine enemies which would not that I should reign over\nthem,\"[fn-86-P8664_1915274:106-nf] etc. The conclusion of the\nparable, however, is adapted also to the simpler; for all of us who have obtained the forgiveness of\nour own sins, and have not forgiven our brethren, are taught at once that we shall suffer the lot of\nhim who was forgiven but did not forgive his fellow-servant.","index":"53","references":[{"fn":"86","code":"P8653_1910317","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xviii. 23.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":18,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8654_1910472","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Luke xix. 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","verses":[{"chapter":19,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8655_1910766","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xviii. 24.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":18,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8656_1911618","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Gal. iv. 26.","bible_refs":[{"book":"galatians","verses":[{"chapter":4,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8657_1911900","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Rev. xxi. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"revelation","verses":[{"chapter":21,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8658_1913083","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xviii. 28.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":18,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8659_1913452","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xvii. 26, 29.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":17,"verses":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29]}]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8660_1913845","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xviii. 31.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":18,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8661_1914264","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xviii. 34.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":18,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8662_1914501","folder":"ANF-10","text":"That is, the God of the Old Testament-according to Marcion.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8663_1915045","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xviii. 35.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":18,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"86","code":"P8664_1915274","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Luke xix. 27.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","verses":[{"chapter":19,"verses":[1]}]}]}]},{"text":"\n14.

Concerning the Pharisees and Scribes Tempting Jesus (by Asking) Whether Was Lawful\nfor a Man to Put Away His Wife for Every Cause.","index":"58","references":[]},{"text":"After this it is written that \"there came unto Him the Pharisees tempting Him and saying,\nIs it lawful for a man to wife for every cause? \"[fn-86-P8687_1920875:120-nf] Mark, also, has written to the like\neffect.[fn-86-P8688_1920940:121-nf] Accordingly, of those who came to\nJesus and inquired of Him, there were some who put questions to tempt Him; and if our Saviour so\ntranscendent was tempted, which of His disciples who is ordained to teach need be vexed, when he is\ntempted by some who inquire, not from the love of learning, but from the wish to tempt? And you might\nfind many passages, if you brought them together, in which the Pharisees tempted our Jesus, and\nothers, different from them, as a certain lawyer,[fn-86-P8689_1921438:122-nf] and perhaps also a scribe,[fn-86-P8690_1921488:123-nf] that by bringing together what is said about\nthose who tempted Him, you might find by investigation what is useful for this kind of inquiries.\nOnly, the Saviour, in response to those who tempted Him, laid down dogmas; for they said, \"Is it\nlawful for a man to put away his own wife for every cause? \"and He answered and said, \"Have ye not\nread that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female? \"[fn-86-P8691_1921926:124-nf] etc. And I think that the Pharisees put forward\nthis word for this reason, that they might attack Him whatever He might say; as, for example, if He\nhad said, \"It is lawful,\" they would have accused Him of dissolving marriages for trifles; but, if He\nhad said, \"It is not lawful,\" they would have accused Him of permitting a man to dwell with a woman,\neven with sins; so, likewise, in the case of the tribute-money,[fn-86-P8692_1922362:125-nf] if He had told them to give, they would have\naccused Him of making the people subject to the Romans, and not to the law of God, but if He had told\nthem not to give, they would have accused Him of creating war and sedition, and of stirring up those\nwho were not able to stand against so powerful an army. But they did not perceive in what way He\nanswered blamelessly and wisely, in the first place, rejecting the opinion that a wife was to be put\naway for every cause, and, in the second place, giving answer to the question about the bill of\ndivorcement; for He saw that not every cause is a reasonable ground for the dissolution of marriage,\nand that the husband must dwell with the wife as the weaker vessel, giving honour,[fn-86-P8693_1923111:126-nf] and bearing her burdens in sills;[fn-86-P8694_1923167:127-nf] and by what is written in Genesis, He puts to\nshame the Pharisees who boasted in the Scriptures of Moses, by saying, \"Have ye not read that He who\ncreated them from the beginning made them male and female,\" etc., and, subjoining to these words,\nbecause of the saying, \"And the twain shall become one flesh,\" teaching in harmony with one flesh,\nnamely, \"So that they are no more twain, but one flesh.\"[fn-86-P8695_1923587:128-nf] And, as tending to convince them that they\nshould not put away their wife for every cause, is it said,\" What God hath joined together, let not\nman put asunder.\"[fn-86-P8696_1923771:129-nf] It is to be observed,\nhowever, in the exposition of the words quoted from Genesis in the Gospel, that they were not spoken\nconsecutively as they are written in the Gospel; and I think that it is not even said about the same\npersons, namely, of those who were formed after the image of God, and of those who were formed from\nthe dust of the ground and from one of the ribs of Adam. For where it is said, \"Male and female made\nHe them,\"[fn-86-P8697_1924228:130-nf] the reference is to those\nformed \"after the image,\" but where He also said, \"For this cause shall a man leave his own father\nand mother,\"[fn-86-P8698_1924385:131-nf] etc., the reference is not\nto those formed after the image; for some time after the Lord God formed the man, taking dust from\nthe ground, and from his side the helpmate. And mark, at the same time, that in the case of those who\nare formed \"after the image,\" the words were not \"husband and wife\" but \"male and female.\" But we\nhave also observed this in the Hebrew, for man is indicated by the word \"is,\" but male by the word\n\"zachar,\" and again woman by the word \"essa,\" but female by the word \"agkeba.\" For at no time is it\n\"woman\" or \"man\" \"after the image,\" but the superior class, the male, and the second, the female. But\nalso if a man leave his mother and his father, he cleaves not to the female, but to his own wife, and\n\"they become,\" since man and woman are one in flesh, \"one flesh.\" Then, describing what ought to be\nin the case of those who are joined together by God, so that they may be joined together in a manner\nworthy of God, the Saviour adds, \"So that they are no more twain; \"[fn-86-P8699_1925403:132-nf] and, wherever there is indeed concord, and\nunison, and harmony, between husband and wife, when he is as ruler and she is obedient to the word,\n\"He shall rule over thee,\"[fn-87-P8700_1925594:133-nf] then of such\npersons we may truly say, \"They are no more twain.\" Then since it was necessary that for \"him who was\njoined to the Lord,\" it should be reserved \"that he should become one spirit with Him,\"[fn-87-P8701_1925818:134-nf] in the case of those who are joined together by\nGod, after the words, \"So that they are no more twain,\" it is said, \"but one flesh.\" And it is God\nwho has joined together the two in one so that they are no more twain, from the time that[fn-87-P8702_1926077:135-nf] the woman is married to the man. And, since God\nhas joined them together, on this account in the case of those who are joined together by God, there\nis a \"gift\"; and Paul knowing this, that marriage according to the Word of God was a \"gift,\" like as\nholy celibacy was a gift, says, \"But I would that all men were like myself; howbeit, each man hath\nhis own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.\"[fn-87-P8703_1926548:136-nf] And those who are joined together by God both\nmind and keep the precept, \"Husbands love your wives, as Christ also the church.\"[fn-87-P8704_1926698:137-nf] The Saviour then commanded, \"What God hath\njoined together, let not man put asunder,\"[fn-87-P8705_1926803:138-nf] but man wishes to put asunder what God hath\njoined together, when, \"falling away from the sound faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and\ndoctrines of demons, through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies, branded in their own conscience as\nwith a hot iron, forbidding,\" not only to commit fornication, but \"to marry,\"[fn-87-P8706_1927143:139-nf] he dissolves even those who had been before\njoined together by the providence of God.

Therefore he, also, having separated from her, married, so to speak,\nanother, having given into the hands of the former the bill of divorcement; wherefore they can no\nlonger do the things enjoined on them by the law, because of the bill of divorcement. And a sign that\nshe has received the bill of divorcement is this, that Jerusalem was destroyed along with what they\ncalled the sanctuary of the things in it which were believed to be holy, and with the altar of burnt\nofferings, and all the worship associated with it. And a further sign of the bill of divorcement is\nthis, that they cannot keep their feasts, even though according to the letter of the law designedly\ncommanded them, in the place which the Lord God appointed to them for keeping feasts; but there is\nthis also, that the whole synagogue has become unable to stone those who have committed this or that\nsin; and thousands of things commanded are a sign of the bill of divorcement; and the fact that\n\"there is no more a prophet,\" and that they say, \"We no longer see signs; \"[fn-87-P8730_1934083:154-nf] \" for the Lord says, \"He hath taken away from\nJudaea and from Jerusalem,\" according to the word of Isaiah, \"Him that is mighty, and her that is\nmighty, a powerful giant,\" etc., down to the words, \"a prudent hearer.\"[fn-87-P8731_1934320:155-nf] Now, He who is the Christ may have taken the\nsynagogue to wife and cohabited with her, but it may be that afterwards she found not favour in His\nsight; and the reason of her not having found favour in His sight was, that there was found in her an\nunseemly thing; for what was more unseemly than the Circumstance that, when it was proposed to them\nto release one at the feast, they asked for the release of Barabbas the robber, and the condemnation\nof Jesus?[fn-87-P8732_1934800:156-nf] And what was more unseemly than\nthe fact, that they all said in His case, \"Crucify Him, crucify Him,\" and \"Away with such a fellow\nfrom the earth\"?[fn-87-P8733_1934972:157-nf] And can this be freed\nfrom the charge of unseemliness, \"His blood be upon us, and upon our children\"?[fn-87-P8734_1935095:158-nf] Wherefore, when He was avenged, Jerusalem was\ncompassed with armies, and its desolation was near,[fn-87-P8735_1935216:159-nf] and their house was taken away from it, and \"the\ndaughter of Zion was left as a booth in a vineyard, and as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, and as a\nbesieged city.\"[fn-87-P8736_1935404:160-nf] And, about the same time,\nI think, the husband wrote out a bill of divorcement to his former wife, and gave it into her hands,\nand sent her away from his own house, and the bond of her who came from the Gentiles has been\ncancelled about which the Apostle Says, \"Having blotted out the bond written in ordinances, which was\ncontrary to us, and He hath taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross; \"[fn-87-P8737_1935825:161-nf] for Paul also and others became proselytes of\nIsrael for her who came from the Gentiles.[fn-87-P8738_1935934:162-nf] The first wife, accordingly, not having found\nfavour before her husband, because in her had been found an unseemly thing, went out from the\ndwelling of her husband, and, going away, has become joined to another man, to whom she has subjected\nherself, whether we should call the husband Barabbas the robber, who is figuratively the devil, or\nsome evil power.

But whether there can be such a change of the life of angels with\nmen, as to amount, so far as concerns their relation to us, to their death, one may put the question\nrash though it be; but be that as it may, she also who has once fallen away from the former husband\nwill not return again to him, for the former husband who sent her away will not be able to turn back\nand take her as wife to himself, after she was defiled.[fn-87-P8757_1941022:175-nf] And if one should dare, using a Scripture which\nis in circulation in the church, but not acknowledged by all to be divine, to soften down a precept\nof this kind, the passage might be taken from The Shepherd, concerning some who as soon as they\nbelieve are put in subjection to Michael,[fn-87-P8758_1941330:176-nf]\nbut falling away from him from love of pleasure, are put in subjection to the angel of luxury,[fn-87-P8759_1941455:177-nf] then to the angel of punishment,[fn-87-P8760_1941516:178-nf] and after this to the angel of repentance; for\nyou observe that the wife or soul who has once been given to luxury no longer returns to the first\nruler, but also besides suffering punishment, is put in subjection to one inferior to Michael; for\nthe angel of penitence is inferior to him. We must therefore take heed lest there be found in us any\nunseemly thing, and we should not find favour in the eyes of our husband Christ, or of the angel who\nhas been set over us. For if we do not take heed, perhaps we also shall receive the bill of\ndivorcement, and either be bereft of our guardian, or go to another man.

For laying down the law in regard to bishops m the\nfirst Epistle to Timothy, he says, \"If a man seeketh the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.\nThe bishop, therefore, must be without reproach, the husbands of one wife, temperate,\nsober-minded,\"[fn-87-P8765_1943096:180-nf] etc.; and, in regard to\ndeacons, \"Let the deacons,\" he says, \"be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their\nown houses well,\"[fn-87-P8766_1943261:181-nf] etc. Yea, and also when\nappointing widows, he says, \"Let there be no one as a widow under threescore years old, having been\nthe wife of one man; \"[fn-87-P8767_1943431:182-nf] and after this he\nsays the things superadded, as being second or third in importance to this.

If any one is blameless,\nthe husband of one wife, having children, that believe\"[fn-87-P8768_1943825:183-nf] -of course-and so on. Now, when we saw that some\nwho have been married twice may be much better than those who have been married once, we were\nperplexed why Paul does not at all permit those who have been twice married to be appointed to\necclesiastical dignities; for also it seemed to me that such a thing was worthy of examination, as it\nwas possible that a man, who had been unfortunate in two marriages, and had lost his second wife\nwhile he was yet young, might have lived for the rest of his years up to old age in the greatest\nself-control and chastity. Who, then, would not naturally be perplexed why at all, when a ruler of\nthe church is being sought for, we do not appoint such a man, though he has been twice married,\nbecause of the expressions about marriage, but lay hold of the man who has been once married as our\nruler, even if he chance to have lived to old age with his wife, and sometimes may not have been\ndisciplined in chastity and temperance? But, from what is said in the law about the bill of\ndivorcement, I reflect whether, seeing that the bishop and the presbyter and the deacon are a symbol\nof things that truly exist in accordance with these names, he wished to appoint those who were\nfiguratively once married, in order that he who is able to give attention to the matter, may find out\nfrom the spiritual law the one who was unworthy of ecclesiastical rule, whose soul did not find\nfavour in the eyes of her husband because there had been found in her an unseemly thing, and she had\nbecome worthy of the bill of divorcement; for such a soul, having dwelt along with a second husband,\nand having been hated by such an one, can no longer, after the second bill of divorcement, return to\nher former husband.[fn-87-P8769_1945581:184-nf] It is likely,\ntherefore, also, that other arguments will be found by those who are wiser than we, and have more\nability to see into such things, whether in the law about the bill of divorcement, or in the\napostolic writings which prohibit those who have been twice married from ruling over the church or\nbeing preferred to preside over it.

For it is not necessary\nfor adultery or any such great indecency to write a bill of divorcement and give it into the hands of\nthe wife; but indeed perhaps Moses called every sin an unseemly thing, on the discovery of which by\nthe husband in the wife, as not finding favour in the eyes of her husband, the bill of divorcement is\nwritten, and the wife is sent away from the house of her husband; \"but from the beginning it hath not\nbeen so.\"[fn-87-P8785_1949705:194-nf] After this our Saviour says,\nnot at all permitting the dissolution of marriages for any other sin than fornication alone, when\ndetected in the wife, \"Whosoever shall but away his own wife, saving for the cause of fornication,\nmaketh her an adulteress.\"[fn-87-P8786_1949979:195-nf] But it might\nbe a subject for inquiry if on this account He hinders any one putting away a wife, unless she be\ncaught in fornication, for any other reason, as for example for poisoning, or for the destruction\nduring the absence of her husband from home of an infant born to them, or for any form of murder\nwhatsoever. And further, if she were found despoiling and pillaging the house of her husband, though\nshe was not guilty of fornication, one might ask if he would with reason cast away such an one,\nseeing that the Saviour forbids any one to put away his own wife saving for the cause of fornication.\nIn either case there appears to be something monstrous, whether it be really monstrous, I do not\nknow; for to endure sins of such heinousness which seem to be worse than adultery or fornication,\nwill appear to be irrational; but again on the other hand to act contrary to the design of the\nteaching of the Saviour, every one would acknowledge to be impious. I wonder therefore why He did not\nsay, Let no one put away his own wife saving for the cause of fornication, but says, \"Whosoever shall\nput away his own wife, saving for the cause of fornication, maketh her an adulteress.\"[fn-87-P8787_1951185:196-nf] For confessedly he who puts away his wife when\nshe is not a fornicator, makes her an adulteress, so far as it lies with him, for if, \"when the\nhusband is living she shall be called an adulteress if she be joined to another man; \"[fn-87-P8788_1951435:197-nf] and when by putting her away, he gives to her\nthe excuse of a second marriage, very plainly in this way he makes her an adulteress. But as to\nwhether her being caught in the act of poisoning or committing murder, furnishes any defence of his\ndismissal of her, you can inquire yourselves; for the husband can also in other ways than by putting\nher away cause his own wife to commit adultery; as, for example, allowing her to do what she wishes\nbeyond what is fitting, and stooping to friendship with what men she wishes, for often from the\nsimplicity of husbands such false steps happen to wives; but whether there is a ground of defence or\nnot for such husbands in the case of such false steps, you will inquire carefully, and deliver your\nopinion also in regard to the difficult questions raised by us on the passage. And even he who\nwithholds himself from his wife makes her oftentimes to be an adulteress when he does not satisfy her\ndesires, even though he does so under the appearance of greater gravity and self-control. And perhaps\nthis man is more culpable who, so far as it rests with him, makes her an adulteress when he does not\nsatisfy her desires than he who, for other reason than fornication, has sent her away,-for poisoning\nor murder or any of the most grievous sins. But as a woman is an adulteress, even though she seem to\nbe married to a man, while the former husband is still living, so also the man who seems to marry her\nwho has been put away, does not so much marry her as commit adultery with her according to the\ndeclaration of our Saviour.","index":"75","references":[{"fn":"87","code":"P8783_1948692","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. v. 32","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"87","code":"P8784_1948937","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Deut. xxiv. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"deuteronomy","verses":[{"chapter":24,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"87","code":"P8785_1949705","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xix. 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":19,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"87","code":"P8786_1949979","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. v. 32.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":5,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"87","code":"P8787_1951185","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. v. 32.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","verses":[{"chapter":5,"verses":[1]}]}]},{"fn":"87","code":"P8788_1951435","folder":"ANF-10","text":"RRom. vii. 3.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"\n25.
