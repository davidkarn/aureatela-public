Now, a similar thing, as Luke has narrated,[fn-78-P7812_1648886:2-nf] happened in the case of Herod and Pilate, who became friends with one another that they might kill Jesus; for, perhaps, their hostility with one another would have prevented Herod from asking that He should be put to death, in order to please the people, who said, \"Crucify Him, Crucify Him,\"[fn-78-P7813_1649198:3-nf] and would have influenced Pilate, who was somewhat inclined against His condemnation, his hostility with Herod giving fresh impulse to the inclination which he previously cherished to release Jesus. But their apparent friendship made Herod stronger in his demand against Jesus with Pilate, who wished, perhaps, also because of the newly-formed friendship to do something to gratify Herod and all the nation of the Jews. And often even now you may see in daily life those who hold the most divergent opinions, whether in the philosophy of the Greeks or in other systems of thought, appearing to be of one mind that they may scoff at and attack Jesus Christ in the person of His disciples. And from these things I think you may go on by rational argument to consider, whether when forces join in opposition which are in disagreement with one another, as of Pharaoh with Nebuchadnezzar,[fn-78-P7814_1650102:4-nf] and of Tirhakah, king of the Ethiopians, with Sennacherib,[fn-78-P7815_1650181:5-nf] a combination then takes place against Jesus and His people. So perhaps, also, \"The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers were gathered together,\"[fn-78-P7816_1650358:6-nf] though not at all before at harmony with one another, that having taken counsel against the Lord and His Christ. they might slay the Lord of glory.","index":"46","references":[{"fn":"78","code":"P7811_1648375","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xvi. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"78","code":"P7812_1648886","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Luke xxiii. 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":23,"verses":[12]}]},{"fn":"78","code":"P7813_1649198","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Luke xxiii. 21.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":23,"verses":[21]}]},{"fn":"78","code":"P7814_1650102","folder":"ANF-10","text":"2 Kings xxiv. 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 kings","chapter":24,"verses":[7]}]},{"fn":"78","code":"P7815_1650181","folder":"ANF-10","text":"2 Kings xix. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 kings","chapter":19,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"78","code":"P7816_1650358","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Ps. ii. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":2,"verses":[2]}]}]},{"text":"\n2. Why the Pharisees Asked a Sign from Heaven.","index":"47","references":[]},{"text":" Now, to this point we have come in our discourse, because of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming together unto Jesus, who disagreed in matters relating to the resurrection, but came, as it were, to an agreement for the sake of tempting our Saviour, and asking Him to show them a sign froth heaven. For, not satisfied with the wonderful signs shown among the people in the healing of all forms of disease and sickness, and with the rest of the miracles which our Saviour had done in the knowledge of many, they wished Him to show to them also a sign from heaven. And I conjecture that they suspected that the signs upon earth might possibly not be of God; for they did not hesitate indeed to say, \"Jesus casts out demons by Beelzebub the prince of the demons; \"[fn-78-P7820_1651327:7-nf] and it seemed to them that a sign from heaven could not spring from Beelzebub or any other wicked power. But they erred in regard to both, in regard to signs upon earth as well as to signs from heaven, not being \"approved money-changers,\"[fn-78-P7821_1651592:8-nf] nor knowing how to distinguish between the spirits that are working, which kind are from God, and which have revolted from Him. And they ought to have known that even many of the portents wrought against Egypt in the time of Moses, though they were not from heaven, were clearly from God, and that the fire which fell from heaven upon the sheep of Job was not from God;[fn-78-P7822_1652103:9-nf] for that fire belonged to the same one as he to whom belonged those who carried off, and made three bands of horsemen against, the cattle of Job. I think, moreover, that in Isaiah-as if signs could be shown both from the earth and from heaven, the true being from God, but \"with all power and signs and lying wonders\"[fn-78-P7823_1652437:10-nf] those from the evil one-it was said to Ahaz, \"Ask for thyself a sign from the Lord thy God in the depth or in the height.\"[fn-78-P7824_1652582:11-nf] For, unless there had been some signs in the depth or in the height which were not from the Lord God, this would not have been said, \"Ask for thyself a sign from the Lord thy God in the depth or in the height.\" But I know well that such an interpretation of the passage, \"Ask for thyself a sign from the Lord thy God,\" will seem to some one rather forced; but give heed to that which is said by the Apostle about the man of sin, the son of perdition, that, \"with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceit of unrighteousness,\"[fn-78-P7825_1653143:12-nf] he shall be manifested to them that are perishing, imitating all kinds of wonders, to-wit, those of truth. And as the enchanters and magicians of the Egyptians, as being inferior to the man of sin and the son of perdition, imitated certain powers, both the signs and wonders of truth, doing lying wonders so that the true might not be believed; so I think the man of sin will imitate signs and powers. And perhaps, also, the Pharisees suspected these things because of the prophecies concerning Him; but I inquire whether also the Sadducees tempting Him asked Jesus to show them a sign from heaven. For unless we say that they suspected this, how shall we describe their relation to the portents which Jesus wrought, who continued hard-hearted and were not put to shame by the miraculous things that were done? But if any one supposes that we have given an occasion of defence to the Pharisees and Sadducees, both when they say that the demons were cast out by Jesus through Beelzebub, and when tempting Him, they ask Jesus about a heavenly sign, let him know that we plausibly say that they were drawn away to the end that they might not believe in the miracles of Jesus; but not as to deserve forgiveness; for they did not look to the words of the prophets which were being fulfilled in the acts of Jesus, which an evil power was not at all capable of imitating. But to bring back a soul which had gone out, so that it came out of the grave when already stinking and passing the fourth day,[fn-78-P7826_1654662:13-nf] was the work of no other than Him who heard the word of the Father, \"Let us make man after our image and likeness.\"[fn-78-P7827_1654804:14-nf] But also to command the winds and to make the violence of the sea cease at a word, was the work of no other than Him through whom all things, both the sea itself and the winds, have come into being. Moreover also as to the teaching which stimulates men to the love of the Creator, in harmony with the law and the prophets, and which checks passions and moulds morals according to piety, what else did it indicate to such as were able to see. than that He was truly the Son of God who wrought works so mighty? In respect of which things He said also to the disciples of John, \"Go your way and tell John what great things ye see and hear; the blind receive their sight,\" etc.[fn-78-P7828_1655495:15-nf] ","index":"48","references":[{"fn":"78","code":"P7820_1651327","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. ix. 24, xii. 24.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":9,"verses":[24]}]},{"fn":"78","code":"P7821_1651592","folder":"ANF-10","text":"The familiar saying so frequently quoted as Scripture in the Fathers, sometimes ascribed to Jesus by them, sometimes to Paul. see Suicer.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"78","code":"P7822_1652103","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Job i. 1 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"job","chapter":1,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"78","code":"P7823_1652437","folder":"ANF-10","text":"2 Thess. ii. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 thessalonians","chapter":2,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"78","code":"P7824_1652582","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Isa. vii. 11.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":7,"verses":[11]}]},{"fn":"78","code":"P7825_1653143","folder":"ANF-10","text":"2 Thess. ii. 9, 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 thessalonians","chapter":2,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"78","code":"P7826_1654662","folder":"ANF-10","text":"2 Thess. ii. 9, 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 thessalonians","chapter":2,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"78","code":"P7827_1654804","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Gen. i. 26.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":1,"verses":[26]}]},{"fn":"78","code":"P7828_1655495","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xi. 4, 5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":11,"verses":[4]}]}]},{"text":"\n3. The Answer of Jesus to Their Request.","index":"49","references":[]},{"text":"Next let us remark in what way, when asked in regard to one sign, that He might show it from heaven, to the Pharisees and Sadducees who put the question, He answers and says, \"An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign, and there shall be no sign given to it, but the sign of Jonah the prophet, \" when also, \"He left them and departed.\"[fn-78-P7832_1655905:16-nf] But the sign of Jonah, in truth, according to their question, was not merely a sign but also a sign from heaven; so that even to those who tempted Him and sought a sign from heaven He, nevertheless, out of His own great goodness gave the sign. For if, as Jonah passed three days and three nights in the whale's belly, so the Son of man did in the heart of the earth, and after this rose up from it,-whence but from heaven shall we say that the sign of the resurrection of Christ came? And especially when, at the time of the passion, He became a sign to the robber who obtained favour from Him to enter into the paradise of God; after this, I think, descending into Hades to the dead, \"as free among the dead.\"[fn-78-P7833_1656635:17-nf] And the Saviour seems to me to conjoin the sign which was to come from Himself with the reason of the sign in regard to Jonah when He says, not merely that a sign like to that is granted by Him but that very sign; for attend to the words, \"And there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet.\"[fn-78-P7834_1656971:18-nf] Accordingly that sign was this sign, because that became indicative of this, so that the elucidation of that sign, which was obscure on the face of it, might be found in the fact that the Saviour suffered, and passed three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. At the same time also we learn the general principle that, if the sign signifies something, each of the signs which are recorded, whether as in actual history, or by way of precept, is indicative of something afterwards fulfilled; as for example, the sign of Jonah going out after three days from the whale's belly was indicative of the resurrection of our Saviour, rising after three days and three nights from the dead; and that which is called circumcision is the sign of that which is indicated by Paul in the words: \"We are the circumcision.\"[fn-78-P7835_1657810:19-nf] Seek you also every sign in the Old Scriptures as indicative of some passage in the New Scripture, and that which is named a sign in the New Covenant as indicative of something either in the age about to be, or even in the subsequent generations after that the sign has taken place.","index":"50","references":[{"fn":"78","code":"P7832_1655905","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xvi. 4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[4]}]},{"fn":"78","code":"P7833_1656635","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Ps.lxxxviii. 6.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"78","code":"P7834_1656971","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xvi. 4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[4]}]},{"fn":"78","code":"P7835_1657810","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Phil. iii. 3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"philippians","chapter":3,"verses":[3]}]}]},{"text":"\n4. Why Jesus Called Them an Adulterous Generation, the Law as Husband.","index":"51","references":[]},{"text":"And He called them, indeed, \"an evil generation,\" because of the quality arising from evil which had been produced in them, for wickedness is voluntary evil-doing, but \"adulterous\" because that when the Pharisees and Sadducees left that which is figuratively called man, the word of truth or the law, they were debauched by falsehood and the law of sin. For if there are two laws, the law in our members warring against the law of the mind, and the law of the mind,[fn-78-P7839_1658647:20-nf] we must say that the law of the mind-that is, the spiritual-is man, to whom the soul was given by God as wife, that is, to the man who is law, according to what is written, \"A wife is married to a man by God; \"[fn-78-P7840_1658877:21-nf] but the other is a paramour of the soul which is subject to it, which also on account of it is called an adulteress. Now that the law is husband of the soul Paul clearly exhibits in the Epistle to the Romans, saying, \"The law hath dominion over a man for so long time as he liveth; for the woman that hath a husband is bound to the husband while he liveth, to the husband who is law,\"[fn-78-P7841_1659283:22-nf] etc. For consider in these things that the law hath dominion over the man so long time as the law liveth,-as a husband over a wife. \"For the woman that hath a husband,\" that is, the soul under the law, \"is bound to the husband while he liveth,\" to the husband who is the law; but if the husband-that is, the law die-she is discharged from the law, which is her husband. Now the law dies to him who has gone up to the condition of blessedness, and no longer lives under the law, but acts like to Christ, who, though He became under law for the sake of those under law, that He might gain those under law,[fn-78-P7842_1660025:23-nf] did not continue under law, nor did He leave subject to law those who had been freed by Him; for He led them up along with Himself to the divine citizenship which is above the law, which contains, as for the imperfect and such as are still sinners, sacrifices for the remission of sins. He then who is without sin, and stands no longer in need of legal sacrifices, perhaps when he has become perfect has passed beyond even the spiritual law, and comes to the Word beyond it, who became flesh to those who live in the flesh, but to those who no longer at all war after the flesh, He is perceived as being the Word, as[fn-78-P7843_1660662:24-nf] He was God in the beginning with God, and reveals the Father. Three things therefore are to be thought of in connection with this place-the woman that hath a husband, who is under a husband-the law; and the woman who is an adulteress, to-wit, the soul, which, while her husband, the law, liveth, has become joined to another husband, namely, the law of the flesh; and the woman who is married to the brother of the dead husband, to the Word who is alive and dies not, who \"being raised from the dead dieth no more, for death hath no more dominion over Him.\"[fn-78-P7844_1661242:25-nf] So far then because of the saying, \"But if the husband die she is discharged from the law, the husband,\" and because of this, \"so then, while her husband liveth, she shall be called an adulteress, if she be joined to another man,\" and because of this, \"but if the husband die, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress though she be joined to another man.\"[fn-78-P7845_1661629:26-nf] But this very saying, \"So then while her husband liveth, she shall be called an adulteress,\" we have brought forward, wishing clearly to show why in answer to the Pharisees and Sadducees who were tempting Him and asking Him to show them a sign from heaven, He said not only \"a wicked generation,\" but an \"adulterous\" generation.[fn-78-P7846_1661979:27-nf] In a general way, then, the law in the members which wars against the law of the mind,[fn-78-P7847_1662085:28-nf] as a man who is an adulterer, is an adulterer of the soul. But now also every power that is hostile, which gains the mastery over the human soul, and has intercourse with it, commits adultery with her who had a bridegroom given to her by God, namely, the Word. After these things it is written that \"He left them and departed.\" For how was the bridegroom-the Word-not going to leave the adulterous generation and depart from it? But you might say that the Word of God, leaving the synagogue of the Jews as adulterous, departed from it, and took a wife of fornication,[fn-78-P7848_1662672:29-nf] namely, those from the Gentiles; since those who were \"Sion, a faithful city,\"[fn-78-P7849_1662767:30-nf] have become harlots; but these have become like the harlot Rahab, who received the spies of Joshua, and was saved with all her house;[fn-78-P7850_1662918:31-nf] after this no longer playing the harlot, but coming to the feet of Jesus, and wetting them with the tears of repentance, and anointing them with the fragrance of the ointment of holy conversation, on account of whom, reproaching Simon the leper,-the former people,-He spoke those things which are written.[fn-78-P7851_1663243:32-nf] ","index":"52","references":[{"fn":"78","code":"P7839_1658647","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Rom. vii. 23.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":7,"verses":[23]}]},{"fn":"78","code":"P7840_1658877","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Prov. xix. 14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","chapter":19,"verses":[14]}]},{"fn":"78","code":"P7841_1659283","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Rom. vii. 1, 2.

Concerning the Leaven of the Pharisees.","index":"53","references":[]},{"text":"\"And His disciples came to the other side and forgot to take loaves.\"[fn-78-P7855_1663396:33-nf] Since the loaves which they had before they came to the other side were no longer useful to the disciples when they came to the other side, for they needed one kind of loaves before they crossed and a different kind when they crossed,-on this account, being careless of taking loaves when going to the other side, they forgot to take loaves with them. To the other side then came the disciples of Jesus who had passed over from things material to things spiritual, and from things sensible to those which are intellectual. And perhaps that He might turn back those who, by crossing to the other side, \"had begun in spirit,\"[fn-78-P7856_1664039:34-nf] from running back to carnal things, Jesus said to them when on the other side, \"Take heed and beware.\"[fn-78-P7857_1664164:35-nf] For there was a certain lump of teaching and of truly ancient leaven,-that according to the bare letter, and on this account not freed from those things which arise from wickedness,-which the Pharisees and Sadducees offered, of which Jesus does not wish His own disciples any longer to eat, having made for them a new and spiritual lump, offering Himself to those who gave up the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees and had come to Him-\"the living bread which came down from heaven and gives life to the world.\"[fn-78-P7858_1664698:36-nf] But since, to him who is no longer going to use the leaven and the lump and the teaching of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, the first thing is to \"see\" and then to \"beware,\" so that no one, by reason of not seeing and from want of taking heed, may ever partake of their forbidden leaven,-on this account He says to the disciples, first, \"see,\" and then, \"beware.\" It is the mark of the clear-sighted and careful to separate the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees and every food that is not of \"the unleavened-bread of sincerity and truth\"[fn-78-P7859_1665263:37-nf] from the living bread, even that which came down from heaven, so that no one who eats may adopt the things of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, but by eating the living and true bread may strengthen his soul. And we might seasonably apply the saying to those who, along with the Christian way of life, prefer to live as the Jews, materially, for these do not see nor beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees, but, contrary to the will of Jesus who forbade it, eat the bread of the Pharisees. Yea and also all, who do not wish to understand that the law is spiritual, and has a shadow of the good things to come,[fn-78-P7860_1665903:38-nf] and is a shadow of the things to come,[fn-78-P7861_1665958:39-nf] neither inquire of what good thing about to be each of the laws is a shadow, nor do they see nor beware of the leaven of the Pharisees; and they also who reject the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead are not on their guard against the leaven of the Sadducees. And there are many among the heterodox who, because of their unbelief in regard to the resurrection of the dead, are imbued with the leaven of the Sadducees. Now, while Jesus said these things, the disciples reasoned, saying not aloud, but in their own hearts, \"We took no loaves.\"[fn-78-P7862_1666524:40-nf] And something like this was what they said, \"If we had loaves we would not have had to take of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees; but since, from want of loaves, we run the risk of taking from their leaven, while the Saviour does not wish us to run back to their teaching, therefore He said to us, \"Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.\"[fn-78-P7863_1666926:41-nf] And these things then they reasoned; Jesus, while looking to that which was in their hearts, and hearing the reasons in them, as the true overseer of hearts, reproves them because they did not see nor remember the loaves which they received from Him; on account of which, even when they appeared to be in want of loaves, they did not need the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.","index":"54","references":[{"fn":"78","code":"P7855_1663396","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xvi. 5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[5]}]},{"fn":"78","code":"P7856_1664039","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Cf.

But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.\"[fn-78-P7867_1667783:42-nf] And though He had not laid bare the interpretation, but still continued to use metaphorical language, the disciples would have understood that the discourse of the Saviour was about the teaching, figuratively called leaven, which the Pharisees and Sadducees were teaching. So long, then, as we have Jesus with us fulfilling the promise which runs, \"Lo, I am with you always unto the consummation of the age,\"[fn-78-P7868_1668211:43-nf] we cannot fast nor be in want of food, so that, because of want of it we should desire to take and eat the forbidden leaven, even from the Pharisees and Sadducees.

And moreover this also is to be observed, in view of those who think that the divinity of the Saviour is not at all demonstrable from the Gospel of Matthew, that the fact that, when the disciples were reasoning among themselves and saying, \"We have no loaves,\" Jesus knew their reasonings and said, \"Why reason ye among yourselves, O ye of little faith, because ye took no loaves,\"[fn-78-P7870_1669239:45-nf] was beyond the power of man; for the Lord alone, as Solomon says in the third Book of Kings, knows the hearts of men.[fn-78-P7871_1669376:46-nf] But since the disciples understood, when Jesus said, \"Beware of the leaven,\"[fn-78-P7872_1669475:47-nf] that He did not tell them to beware of the loaves but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees, you will understand that whenever leaven is named it is put figuratively for teaching, whether in the law, or in the Scriptures which come after the law; and so perhaps leaven is not offered upon the altar; for it is not right that prayers should take the form of teaching, but should only be supplications of good things from God. But one might inquire, on account of what has been said about disciples who came to the other side, if any one who has reached the other side can be reproached as one of little faith, and as not yet understanding nor remembering what was done by Jesus. But it is not difficult, I think, to say to this, that in relation to that which is perfect, on the coming of which \"that which is in part shall be done away,\"[fn-78-P7873_1670341:48-nf] all our faith here is little faith, and in regard to that, we who know in part do not yet know nor remember; for we are not able to obtain a memory which is sufficient and able to attain to the magnitude of the nature of the speculations.","index":"56","references":[{"fn":"78","code":"P7867_1667783","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xvi. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"78","code":"P7868_1668211","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xxviii. 20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":28,"verses":[20]}]},{"fn":"78","code":"P7869_1668582","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xv. 32.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":15,"verses":[32]}]},{"fn":"78","code":"P7870_1669239","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xvi. 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[8]}]},{"fn":"78","code":"P7871_1669376","folder":"ANF-10","text":"1 Kings viii. 39","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 kings","chapter":8,"verses":[39]}]},{"fn":"78","code":"P7872_1669475","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xvi. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"78","code":"P7873_1670341","folder":"ANF-10","text":"1 Cor. xiii. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":13,"verses":[10]}]}]},{"text":"\n7.

And I think that just as a man commits adultery in his heart only, though not proceeding altogether to the overt act, so he commits in his heart the rest of the things which are forbidden. As then he who has committed adultery in his heart will be punished proportionately to adultery of this kind, so also he who has done in his heart any one of the things forbidden, for example, who has stolen in his heart only, or borne false witness in his heart only, will not be punished as he who has stolen in fact, or who has completed the very act of false testimony, but only as he who has done such things in his heart. There is also the case of the man who while he did not arrive at the evil action, came short of it in spite of his own will. For if, in addition to willing it, he has attempted it, but not carried it out, he will be punished not as one who has sinned in his heart alone but in deed. To questions of this sort one might ask, whether any one commits adultery in his heart, even if he does not do the deed of adultery, but lacks self-control in heart only. And the like also you will say concerning the rest of things which are deserving of praise. But the passage possibly contains a plausible fallacy which must be cleared away, I think, in this manner: adultery which takes place in the heart is a less sin, than if one were also to add to it the act. But it is impossible that there can be chastity in the heart, hindering the chaste action-unless indeed one brings forward for an illustration of this the case of the virgin who according to the law was violated in solitude;[fn-78-P7877_1672428:49-nf] for it may be granted that the heart of any one may be most pure,[fn-78-P7878_1672515:50-nf] but that force in a matter of licentiousness has caused the corruption of the body of her who was chaste. In truth she seems to me to be altogether chaste in secret heart, hut no longer to be pure in body such as she was before the act of violence; but though she is not pure outwardly, is she therefore now also unchaste?

But also the Jews, as worthy of the veil which was upon their heart, held false opinions concerning Jesus; while Peter as not a disciple \"of flesh and blood,\"[fn-78-P7892_1676738:58-nf] but as one fit to receive the revelation of the Father in heaven, confessed that He was the Christ. The saying of Peter to the Saviour, \"Thou art the Christ,\" when the Jews did not know that He was Christ, was indeed a great thing, but greater that he knew Him not only to be Christ, but also \"the Son of the living God,\"[fn-78-P7893_1677080:59-nf] who had also said through the prophets, \"I live,\"[fn-78-P7894_1677150:60-nf] and \"They have forsaken Me the spring of living water; \"[fn-78-P7895_1677227:61-nf] -and He is life also, as from the Father the spring of life, who said, \"I am the Life; \"[fn-78-P7896_1677334:62-nf] And consider carefully, whether, as the spring of the river is not the same thing as the river, the spring of life is not the same as life.

Now, if the gates of Hades prevail against any one, such an one cannot be a rock upon which Christ builds the church, nor the church built by Jesus upon the rock; for the rock is inaccessible to the serpent, and it is stronger than the gates of Hades which are opposing it, so that because of its strength the gates of Hades do not prevail against it; but the church, as a building of Christ who built His own house wisely upon the rock,[fn-79-P7921_1684260:81-nf] is incapable of admitting the gates of Hades which prevail against every man who is outside the rock and the church, but have no power against it.","index":"66","references":[{"fn":"79","code":"P7911_1680864","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xvi. 18.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[18]}]},{"fn":"79","code":"P7912_1681001","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xvi. 18.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[18]}]},{"fn":"79","code":"P7913_1681219","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xvi. 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[19]}]},{"fn":"79","code":"P7914_1681537","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xvi. 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[19]}]},{"fn":"79","code":"P7915_1681707","folder":"ANF-10","text":"John. xx. 22.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":20,"verses":[22]}]},{"fn":"79","code":"P7916_1682105","folder":"ANF-10","text":"2 Cor. iii. 18.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":3,"verses":[18]}]},{"fn":"79","code":"P7917_1682266","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xvi. 16","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[16]}]},{"fn":"79","code":"P7918_1682725","folder":"ANF-10","text":"1 Cor. x. 4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":10,"verses":[4]}]},{"fn":"79","code":"P7919_1683128","folder":"ANF-10","text":"1 Cor. i. 30.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":1,"verses":[30]}]},{"fn":"79","code":"P7920_1683784","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Prov, xxx. l9.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"79","code":"P7921_1684260","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. vii. 24.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":7,"verses":[24]}]}]},{"text":"\n12.

Now the gates of Zion may be conceived as opposed to the gates of death, so that there is one gate of death, dissoluteness, but a gate of Zion, self-control; and so a gate of death, unrighteousness, but a gate of Zion, righteousness, which the prophet shows forth saying, \"This is the gate of the Lord, the righteous shall enter into it.\"[fn-79-P7939_1688414:93-nf] And again there is cowardice, a gate of death, but manly courage, a gate of Zion; and want of prudence, a gate of death, but its opposite, prudence, a gate of Zion.

Let, then, the principalities and powers with which our wrestling is, be called gates of Hades, but the \"ministering spirits\"[fn-79-P7943_1689195:97-nf] gates of righteousness.

And he enters in, as a temperate man, through an opened gate-the gate of temperance-by the key which opens temperance; and, as a righteous man, by another gate-the gate of righteousness-which is opened by the key of righteousness; and so with the rest of the virtues. For I think that for every virtue of knowledge certain mysteries of wisdom corresponding to the species of the virtue are opened up to him who has lived according to virtue; the Saviour giving to those who are not mastered by the gates of Hades as many keys as there are virtues, which open gates equal in number, which correspond to each virtue according to the revelation of the mysteries. And perhaps, also, each virtue is a kingdom of heaven, and all together are a kingdom of the heavens; so that according to this he is already in the kingdom of the heavens who lives according to the virtues, so that according to this the saying, \"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,\"[fn-79-P7952_1692828:103-nf] is to be referred, not to the time, but to deeds and dispositions; for Christ, who is all virtue, has come, and speaks, and on account of this the kingdom of God is within His disciples, and not here or there.[fn-79-P7953_1693067:104-nf] But consider how great power the rock has upon which the church is built by Christ, and how great power every one has who says, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God,\" so that the judgments of this man abide sure, as if God were judging in him, that in the very act of judging the gates of Hades shall not prevail against him. But when one judges unrighteously, and does not bind upon earth according to the Word of God, nor loose upon earth according to His will, the gates of Hades prevail against him; but, in the case of any one against whom the gates of Hades do not prevail, this man judges righteously. Wherefore he has the keys of the kingdom of heaven, opening to those who have been loosed on earth that they may be also loosed in heaven, and free; and shutting to those who by his just judgment have been bound on earth that they also may be bound in heaven, and condemned. But when those who maintain the function of the episcopate make use of this word as Peter, and, having received the keys of the kingdom of heaven from the Saviour, teach that things bound by them, that is to say, condemned, are also bound in heaven, and that those which have obtained remission by them are also loosed in heaven, we must say that they speak wholesomely if they have the way of life on account of which it was said to that Peter, \"Thou art Peter; \"[fn-79-P7954_1694449:105-nf] and if they are such that upon them the church is built by Christ, and to them with good reason this could be referred; and the gates of Hades ought not to prevail against him when he wishes to bind and loose. But if he is tightly bound with the cords of his sins,[fn-79-P7955_1694736:106-nf] to no purpose does he bind and loose. And perhaps you can say that in the heavens which are in the wise man-that, is the virtues,-the bad man is bound; and again in these the virtuous man is loosed, and has received an indemnity for the sins which he committed before his virtue. But, as the man, who has not the cords of sins nor iniquities compared to a \"long rope or to the strap of the yoke of a heifer,\"[fn-79-P7956_1695165:107-nf] not even God could bind, in like manner, no Peter, whoever he may be; and if any one who is not a Peter, and does not possess the things here spoken of, imagines as a Peter that he will so bind on earth that the things bound are bound in heaven, and will so loose on earth that the things loosed are loosed in heaven, he is puffed up, not understanding the meaning of the Scriptures, and, being puffed up, has fallen into the ruin of the devil.[fn-79-P7957_1695629:108-nf] ","index":"72","references":[{"fn":"79","code":"P7950_1691224","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xvi. 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[19]}]},{"fn":"79","code":"P7951_1691447","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xvi. 18.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[18]}]},{"fn":"79","code":"P7952_1692828","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. iii. 2; iv. 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":3,"verses":[2]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":3,"verses":[2]}]},{"fn":"79","code":"P7953_1693067","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Luke xvii. 21","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":17,"verses":[21]}]},{"fn":"79","code":"P7954_1694449","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xvi. 18.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[18]}]},{"fn":"79","code":"P7955_1694736","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Prov. v. 22.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","chapter":5,"verses":[22]}]},{"fn":"79","code":"P7956_1695165","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Isa. v. 18.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":5,"verses":[18]}]},{"fn":"79","code":"P7957_1695629","folder":"ANF-10","text":"1 Tim. iii. 10,","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 timothy","chapter":3,"verses":[10]}]}]},{"text":"\n15.

Did He then wish them when they were already discharging the function of Apostles to proclaim that He was the Christ? For, if He wished it, it is fitting to inquire why He now at all commands the disciples that they should not say that He was the Christ? Or if He did not wish it, how can the things concerning the apostleship be safely maintained? And these things also one may inquire at this place,-whether, when He sent away the Twelve, He did not send them away with the understanding that He was the Christ? But if the Twelve had such understanding, manifestly Peter had it also; how, then, is he now pronounced blessed? For the expression here plainly indicates that now for the first time Peter confessed that Christ was the Son of the living God, Matthew then, according to some of the manuscripts, has written, \"Then He commanded His disciples that they should tell no man that He was the Christ,\" but[fn-79-P7963_1697047:111-nf] Mark says, \"He charged them that they should tell no man of Him; \"[fn-79-P7964_1697136:112-nf] and Luke, \"He charged them and commanded them to tell this to no man.\"[fn-79-P7965_1697229:113-nf] But what is the \"this\"? Was it that also according to him, Peter answered and said to the question, \"Who say ye that I am.\"-\"The Christ, the Son of the living God? \"[fn-79-P7966_1697415:114-nf] You must know, however, that some manuscripts of the Gospel according to Matthew have, \"He charged.\"[fn-79-P7967_1697542:115-nf] The difficulty thus started seems to me a very real difficulty; but let a solution which cannot be impugned be sought out, and let the finder of it bring it forward before all, if it be more credible than that which shall be advanced by us as a fairly temperate view.[fn-79-P7968_1697832:116-nf] Consider, then, if you can say, that the belief that Jesus is the Christ is inferior to the knowledge of that which is believed. And perhaps also there is a difference in the knowledge of Jesus as the Christ, as every one who knows does not know Him alike. From the words in John, \"If ye abide in My word, ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free,\"[fn-79-P7969_1698243:117-nf] it is plain that belief without knowledge is inferior to knowing; but that there is a difference in the knowledge of Jesus as the Christ, as all who know Him do not know Him equally, is a fact self-evident to any one who gives even a very little consideration to the matter. For who would not acknowledge, for example, that Timothy, though he knew that Jesus was the Christ, had not been enlightened to such an extent in the knowledge of Him as the Apostle had been enlightened? And who would not also admit this-that though many, speaking the truth, say about God, \"He has given to me a true knowledge of things that are,\" yet they will not say this with equal insight and apprehension of the things known, nor as knowing the same number of things? But it is not only in respect of the difference of knowing that those who know do not know alike, bat also according to that which is the source of the knowledge; so that according to this he who knows the Son by the revelation of the Father,[fn-79-P7970_1699263:118-nf] as Peter is testified to have known, has the highest beatitude. Now, if these views of ours are sound, you will consider whether the Twelve formerly believed but did not know; but, after believing, they gained also the rudiments of knowledge and knew a few things about Him; and afterwards they continued to advance in knowledge so that they were able to receive the knowledge from the Father who reveals the Son; in which position Peter was, when he was pronounced blessed; for also he is pronounced blessed not merely because he said, \"Thou art the Christ,\" but with the addition, \"the Son of the living God.\" Accordingly Mark and Luke who have recorded that Peter answered and said, \"Thou art the Christ,\" but have not given the addition found in Matthew, have not recorded that he was declared blessed for what had been said, nor the blessing which followed the declaration of blessedness, \"Thou art Peter,\"[fn-79-P7971_1700197:119-nf] etc.","index":"74","references":[{"fn":"79","code":"P7961_1695879","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xvi. 20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[20]}]},{"fn":"79","code":"P7962_1696013","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. x. 5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":10,"verses":[5]}]},{"fn":"79","code":"P7963_1697047","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xvi. 20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[20]}]},{"fn":"79","code":"P7964_1697136","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Mark viii. 30.","bible_refs":[{"book":"mark","chapter":8,"verses":[30]}]},{"fn":"79","code":"P7965_1697229","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Luke ix. 21.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":9,"verses":[21]}]},{"fn":"79","code":"P7966_1697415","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xvi. 15, 16.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[15]}]},{"fn":"79","code":"P7967_1697542","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xvi. 20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[20]}]},{"fn":"79","code":"P7968_1697832","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Or, which he may regard as mediocre.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"79","code":"P7969_1698243","folder":"ANF-10","text":"John viii. 31, 32.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":8,"verses":[31]}]},{"fn":"79","code":"P7970_1699263","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xvi. 16.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[16]}]},{"fn":"79","code":"P7971_1700197","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xvi. 18.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[18]}]}]},{"text":"\n16.

And according to a second way we might interpret the saying as follows. If any one, who has grasped what salvation really is, wishes to procure the salvation of his own life, let this man having taken farewell of this life, and denied himself and taken up his own cross, and following me, lose his own life to the world; for having lost it for my sake and for the sake of all my teaching, he will gain the end of loss of this kind-salvation.

And when it is said in the law, \"I have placed life before thy face,\"[fn-81-P8121_1736817:215-nf] the Scripture says this about Him who said, \"I am the Life,\" and about His enemy, death; the one or other of which each of us by his deeds is always choosing. And when we sin with life before our face, the curse is fulfilled against us which says, \"And thy life shall be hanging up before thee,\" etc., down to the words, \"and for the sights of thine eyes which thou shall see.\"[fn-81-P8122_1737217:216-nf] As, therefore, the Life is also the living bread which came down from heaven and gave life to the world,[fn-81-P8123_1737351:217-nf] so His enemy death is dead bread. Now every rational soul is fed either on living bread or dead bread, by the opinions good or bad which it receives. As then in the case of more common foods it is the practice at one time only to taste them, and at another to eat of them more largely; so also, in the case of these loaves, one eats insufficiently only tasting them, but another is satiated,-he that is good or is on the way to being good with the living bread which came down from heaven, but he that is wicked with the dead bread, which is death; and some perhaps sparingly, and sinning a little, only taste of death; but those who have attained to virtue do not even taste of it, but are always fed on the living bread. It naturally followed then in the case of Peter, against whom the gates of Hades will not prevail, that he did not taste of death, since any one tastes of death and eats death at the time when the gates of Hades prevail against him; and one eats or tastes of death in proportion as the gates of Hades to a greater or less extent, more or fewer in number, prevail against him. But also for the sons of thunder who were begotten of thunder, which is a heavenly thing, it was impossible to taste of death, which is extremely far removed from thunder, their mother. But these things the Word prophesies to those who shall be perfected, and who by standing with the Word advanced so far that they did not taste of death, until they saw the manifestation and the glory and the kingdom and the excellency of the Word of God in virtue of which He excels every word, which by an appearance of truth draws away and drags about those who are not able to break through the bonds of distraction, and go up to the height of the excellency of the Word of truth.","index":"110","references":[{"fn":"81","code":"P8118_1736189","folder":"ANF-10","text":"John xiv. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":14,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"81","code":"P8119_1736338","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Col. iii. 3, 4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"colossians","chapter":3,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"81","code":"P8120_1736550","folder":"ANF-10","text":"1 Cor. xv. 26.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":15,"verses":[26]}]},{"fn":"81","code":"P8121_1736817","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Deut. xxx. 15.","bible_refs":[{"book":"deuteronomy","chapter":30,"verses":[15]}]},{"fn":"81","code":"P8122_1737217","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Deut. xxviii. 66, 67.","bible_refs":[{"book":"deuteronomy","chapter":28,"verses":[66]}]},{"fn":"81","code":"P8123_1737351","folder":"ANF-10","text":"John vi. 33, 51.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":6,"verses":[33]}]}]},{"text":"\n34.

Now, the Saviour says to the eleven disciples when He rose from the dead, this among other things, \"Lo, I am with you all the days, even until the consummation of the age.\"[fn-81-P8128_1739896:219-nf] When He said this, did He promise that He was going to be with them until the consummation of the age, but that after the consummation of the age, when another age was at hand, which is \"called the age to come,\" He would be no longer with them?-so that according to this, the condition of the disciples would be better before the consummation of the age than after the consummation of the age? But I do not think that any one will dare to say, that after the consummation of the age the Son of God will be no longer with the disciples, because the expression declares that He will be with them for so long, until the consummation of the age is at hand; for it is clear that the matter under inquiry was, whether the Son of God was forthwith going to be with His disciples before the age to come and the hoped for promises of God which were given as a recompense. But there might have been a question-it being granted that He would be with them-whether sometimes He was present with them, and sometimes not present. Wherefore setting us free from the suspicion that might have arisen from doubt, He declared that now and even all the days He would be with the disciples, and that He would not leave those who had become His disciples until the consummation of the age; (because He said \"all the days\" He did not deny that by night, when the sun set, He would be present with them.) But if such is the force of the words, \"until the consummation of the age,\" plainly we shall not be compelled to admit that those who see the Son of man coming in His own kingdom shall taste of death, after being deemed worthy of beholding Him in such guise. But as in the case of the passage we brought forward, the urgent necessity was to teach us that \"until the consummation of the age\" He would not leave us but be with us all the days; so also in this case I think that it is clear to those who know how to look at the logical coherence of things that He who has seen once for all \"the Son of man coming in His own kingdom,\" and seen Him \"in His own glory,\" and seen \"the kingdom of God come with power,\" could not possibly taste of death after the contemplation of things so good and great. But apart from the word of the promise of Jesus, we have conjectured not without reason that we would taste of death, so long as we were not yet held worthy to see \"the kingdom of God come with power,\" and \"the Son of man coming in His own glory and in His own kingdom.\"","index":"112","references":[{"fn":"81","code":"P8127_1739363","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xvi. 28.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":16,"verses":[28]}]},{"fn":"81","code":"P8128_1739896","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xxviii. 20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":28,"verses":[20]}]}]},{"text":"\n35.

But here I inquire whether it is a less evil to see death, but a greater evil than seeing to taste of it, but still worse than this that death should follow any one, and not only follow him, but also now come upon him and seize him whom it formerly followed; but to be swallowed up seems to be more grievous than all the things spoken of. But giving heed to what is said, and to the differences of sins committed, you will not I think, be slow to admit that things of this kind were intended by the Spirit who caused these things to be written in the oracles of God. But, if it be necessary to give an exposition clearer than what has been said of what is signified by seeing the Son of man coming in His own kingdom, or in His own glory, and what is signified by seeing the kingdom of God come with power, these things-whether those that are made to shine in our hearts, or that are found by those who seek, or that enter gradually into our thoughts.-let each one judge as he wills-we will set forth. He who beholds and apprehends the excellency of the Word, as tie breaks down and refutes all the plausible forms of things which are truly lies but profess to be truths, sees the Son of man, (according to the word of John, \"the Word of God,\") coming in His own kingdom; but if such an one were to behold the Word, not only breaking down plausible oppositions, but also representing His own truths with perfect clearness, he would behold His glory in addition to His kingdom. And such an one indeed would see in Him the kingdom of God come with power; and he would see this, as one who is no longer now under the reign of \"sin which reigns in the mortal body of those who sin,\"[fn-81-P8137_1745379:225-nf] but is ever under the orders of the king, who is God of all, whose kingdom is indeed potentially \"within us,\"[fn-81-P8138_1745509:226-nf] but actually, and, as Mark has called it, \"with power,\" and not at all in weakness within the perfect alone.

But it seems to me, that those who are led up by Jesus into the high mountain, and are deemed worthy of beholding His transfiguration apart, are not without purpose led up six days after the discourses previously spoken. For since in six days-the perfect number-the whole world,-this perfect work of art,-was made, on this account I think that he who transcends all the things of the world by beholding no longer the things which are seen, for they are temporal, but already the things which not seen, and only the things which are not seen, because that they are eternal, is represented in the words, \"After six days days Jesus took up with Him\" certain persons. If therefore any one of us wishes to be taken by Jesus, and led up by Him into the high mountain, and be deemed worthy of beholding His transfiguration apart, let him pass beyond the six days, because he no longer beholds the things which are seen, nor longer loves the world, nor the things in the world,[fn-81-P8143_1747166:228-nf] nor lusts after any worldly lust, which is the lust of bodies, and of the riches of the body, and of the glory which is after the flesh, and whatever things whose nature it is to distract and drag away the soul from the things which are better and diviner, and bring it down and fix it fast to the deceit of this age, in wealth and glory, and the rest of the lusts which are the foes of truth. For when he has passed through the six days, as we have said, he will keep a new Sabbath, rejoicing in the lofty mountain, because he sees Jesus transfigured before him; for the Word has different forms, as He appears to each as is expedient for the beholder, and is manifested to no one beyond the capacity of the beholder.","index":"116","references":[{"fn":"81","code":"P8142_1745865","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt. xvii. 1; Mark ix.2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":17,"verses":[1]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":17,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"81","code":"P8143_1747166","folder":"ANF-10","text":"1 John ii. 15.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 john","chapter":2,"verses":[15]}]}]},{"text":"\n37.

But let such an one attend more exactly to the statements about Peter and the rest of the Apostles, how even they made requests as if they were yet alien from Him who was to redeem them from the enemy and purchase them with His own precious blood; or let them also, who will have it that even before the passion of Jesus the Apostles were perfect, tell us whence it came about that \"Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep.\"[fn-81-P8172_1755366:245-nf] But to anticipate something else of what follows and apply it to the subject in hand, I would raise in turn these questions,-whether it is possible for any one to find occasion of stumbling in Jesus apart from the working of the devil who caused him to stumble; and whether it is possible for any one to deny Jesus, and that in presence of a little maid and a doorkeeper and men most worthless, unless a spirit had been with him in his denial hostile to the Spirit which is given and the wisdom, (which is given) to those who are assisted by God to make confession, according to a certain desert of theirs. But he who has learned to refer the roots of sin to the father of sin, the devil, will not say that apart from him either the Apostles were caused to stumble, or that Peter denied Christ thrice before that well-known cock-crowing. But if this be so, consider whether perhaps with a view to make Jesus stumble, so far as was in his power, and to turn Him aside from the dispensation whose characteristic was suffering that brought salvation to men, which He undertook with great willingness, seeking to effect these things which seemed to contribute to this end, he himself also here wishes as it were, by deceit, to draw away Jesus, as if calling upon Him no longer to condescend to men, and come to them, and undergo death for them, but to abide on the high mountain with Moses and Elijah. But he promised also to build three tabernacles, one apart for Jesus, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah, as if one tabernacle would not have sufficed for the three, if it had been necessary for them to be in tabernacles and in the high mountain. And perhaps also in this he acted with evil intent, when he incited him \"who did not know what he said,\" not desiring that Jesus and Moses and Elijah should be together, but desiring to separate them from one another, under pretext of the three tabernacles.\" And likewise it was a lie, \"It is good for us to be here; \"[fn-81-P8173_1757353:246-nf] for if it had been a good thing they would also have remained there.

For since it is the function of a tabernacle to overshadow him who is in it, and to shelter him, and the bright cloud overshadowed them, God made, as it were, a diviner tabernacle, inasmuch as it was bright, that it might be to them a pattern of the resurrection to come; for a bright cloud overshadows the just, who are at once protected and illuminated and shone Upon by it. But what might the bright cloud, which overshadows the just, be? Is it, perhaps, the fatherly power, from which comes the voice of the Father bearing testimony to the Son as beloved and well-pleasing, and exhorting those who were under its shadow to hear Him and no other one? But as He speaks of old, so also always does He speak through what He wills. And perhaps, too, the Holy Spirit is the bright cloud which overshadows the just, and prophesies of the things of God, who works in it, and says, \"This is My beloved Son in whom I am well-pleased; \"but I would venture also to say that our Saviour is a bright cloud. When, therefore, Peter said, \"Let us make here three tabernacles,\"[fn-81-P8196_1763480:263-nf] ... one from the Father Himself, and from the Son, and one from the Holy Spirit. For a bright cloud of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit overshadows the genuine disciples of Jesus; or a cloud overshadows the Gospel and the law and the prophets, which is bright to him who is able to see the light of it in the Gospel, and the law, and the prophets. But perhaps the voice from the cloud says to Moses and Elijah, \"This is My beloved Son in whom I am well-pleased, hear Him,\" as they were desirous to see the Son of man, and to hear Him, and to behold Him as He was in glory. And perhaps it teaches the disciples that He who was, in a literal sense, the Son of God, and His beloved in whom He was well-pleased, whom it behoved them especially to hear, was He who was then beheld, and transfigured, and whose face shone as the sun, and who was clothed with garments white as the light.","index":"128","references":[{"fn":"81","code":"P8195_1762161","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt, xvii. 5.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"81","code":"P8196_1763480","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Matt, xvii. 5.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"\n43.

Wherefore since His being glorified in the resurrection was akin to His transfiguration, and to the vision of His face as the sun, on this account He wishes that these things should then be spoken of by the Apostles, when He rose from the dead.
