After that the Lord Jesus had accomplished all that He foreknew required accomplishment before His death, and had, when it pleased Himself, given up the ghost, what followed thereafter, as related by the evangelist, let us now consider. \"The Jews therefore,\" he says, \"because it was the preparation (parasceve), that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the Sabbath-day (for that Sabbath-day was an high day), besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.\" Not that their legs might be taken away, but the persons themselves whose legs were broken for the purpose of effecting their death, and permitting them to be detached from the tree, lest their continuing to hang on the crosses should defile the great festal day by the horrible spectacle of their day-long torments.","index":"3","references":[]},{"text":"2. \"Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other who was, crucified with Him. But when they came to Jesus, and saw that He was dead already, they brake not His legs: but one of the soldiers with a spear laid open[fn-37-P3797_2084430:1-nf] His side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.\" A suggestive[fn-37-P3798_2084512:2-nf] word was made use of by the evangelist, in not saying pierced, or wounded His side, or anything else, but \"opened;that thereby, in a sense, the gate of life might be thrown open, from whence have flowed forth the sacraments of the Church, without which there is no entrance to the life which is the true life. That blood was shed for the remission of sins; that water it is that makes up the health-giving cup, and supplies at once the layer of baptism and water for drinking. This was announced beforehand, when Noah was commanded to make a door in the side of the ark,[fn-37-P3799_2085096:3-nf] whereby the animals might enter which were not destined to perish in the flood, and by which the Church was prefigured. Because of this, the first woman was formed from the side of the man when asleep,[fn-38-P3800_2085314:4-nf] and was called Life, and the mother of all living.[fn-38-P3801_2085381:5-nf] Truly it pointed to a great good, prior to the great evil of the transgression (in the guise of one thus lying asleep).[fn-38-P3802_2085519:6-nf] This second Adam bowed His head and fell asleep on the cross, that a spouse might be formed for Him from that which flowed from the sleeper's side. O death, whereby the dead are raised anew to life! What can be purer than such blood? What more health-giving than such a wound?","index":"4","references":[{"fn":"37","code":"P3797_2084430","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Aperuit.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"37","code":"P3798_2084512","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Vigilans.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"37","code":"P3799_2085096","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Gen. vi. 16.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":6,"verses":[16]}]},{"fn":"38","code":"P3800_2085314","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Gen. ii. 22.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":2,"verses":[22]}]},{"fn":"38","code":"P3801_2085381","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Gen. iii. 20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":3,"verses":[20]}]},{"fn":"38","code":"P3802_2085519","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"This last clause is found only in three of the Augustinian Mss.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"3. \"And he that saw it,\" he says, \"bare record, and his record is true; and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye also might believe.\" He said not, That ye also might know, but \"that ye might believe;\" for he knoweth who hath seen, that he who hath not seen might believe his testimony.

For after having already said, \"they came to the sepulchre,\" he goes back to tell us how they came, and says, \"so they ran both together,\" etc. Where he shows that, by outrunning his companion, there came first to the sepulchre that other disciple, by whom he means himself, while he relates all[fn-38-P3814_2091264:13-nf] as if speaking of another.","index":"9","references":[{"fn":"38","code":"P3814_2091264","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Some editions here insert into the text, More sanctae Scripturae, \"after the manner of Holy Scripture.\" Others enclose it within brackets.-Migne.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"8. \"And he stooping down,\" he says, \"saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.

I can suppose no such thing. But we hasten on to other points, on which we are compelled to linger by the need there is for investigation, or some other kind of obscurity.

This also of a certainty is not without a meaning, but I am without the leisure needful for its explanation. \"And he saw, and believed.\" Here some, by not giving due attention, suppose that John believed that Jesus had risen again; but there is no indication of this from the words that follow. For what does he mean by immediately adding, \"For as yet they knew not the scripture, that He must rise again from the dead\"? He could not then have believed that He had risen again, when he did not know that it behoved Him to rise again. What then did he see? what was it that he believed? What but this, that he saw the sepulchre empty, and believed what the woman had said, that He had been taken away from the tomb? \"For as yet they knew not the scripture, that He must rise again from the dead.\" Thus also when they heard of it from the Lord Himself, although it was uttered in the plainest terms, yet from their custom of hearing Him speaking by parables, they did not understand, and believed that something else was His meaning.
