Yet most of all must those things be commended to our memory, which are of most force against heretics; whose insidious designs cease not to circumvent all that are weaker and more negligent. Remember that our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ both died for us, and rose again; died, to wit, for our offenses, rose again for our justification.[fn-40-P4056_2225496:2-nf] Even as ye have just heard concerning the two disciples whom He met with in the way, how \"their eyes were holden that they should not know Him:\"[fn-40-P4057_2225658:3-nf] and He found them despairing of the redemption that was in Christ, and deeming that now He had suffered and was dead as a man, not accounting that as Son of God He ever liveth; and deeming too that He was so dead in the flesh as not to come to life again, but just as one of the prophets: as those of you who were attentive have just now heard their own words. Then\"He opened to them the Scriptures, beginning at Moses,\" and going through all the prophets, showing them that all He had suffered had been foretold, lest they should be more staggered if the Lord should rise again, and the more fail to believe Him, if these things had not been told before concerning Him. For the firmness of faith is in this, that all things which came to pass in Christ were foretold. The disciples, then, knew Him not, save \"in the breaking of bread.\" And truly he that eateth and drinketh not judgment to himself in the breaking of bread doth know Christ.[fn-40-P4058_2226621:4-nf] Afterward also those eleven \"thought they saw a spirit.\" He gave Himself to be handled by them, who also gave Himself to be crucified; to be crucified by enemies, to be handled by friends: yet the Physician of all, both of the ungodliness of those, and of the unbelief of these. For ye heard when the Acts of the Apostles were read, how many thousands of Christ's slayers believed.[fn-40-P4059_2227021:5-nf] If those believed afterwards who had killed, should not those believe who for a little while doubted? And yet even in regard of them, (a thing which ye ought especially to observe, and to commit to your memory, because that which shall make us strong against insidious errors, God has been pleased to put in the Scriptures, against which no man dares to speak, who in any sort wishes to seem a Christian), when He had given Himself to be handled by them, that did not suffice Him, but He would also confirm by means of the Scriptures the heart of them that believe: for He looked forward to us who should be afterwards; seeing that in Him we have nothing that we can handle, but have that which we may read. For if those believed only because they held and handled, what shall we do? Now, Christ is ascended into heaven; He is not to come save at the end, to judge the quick and the dead. Whereby shall we believe, but by that whereby it was His will that even those who handled Him should be confirmed? For He opened to them the Scriptures and showed them that it behoved Christ to suffer, and that all things should be fulfilled which were written of Him in the Law of Moses, and the Prophets, and the Psalms. He embraced in His discourse the whole ancient text of the Scriptures. All that there is of those former Scriptures tells of Christ; but only if it find ears. He also\"opened their understanding that they might understand the Scriptures.\" Whence we also must pray for this, that He would open our understanding.","index":"4","references":[{"fn":"40","code":"P4056_2225496","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Rom. iv. 25.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":4,"verses":[25]}]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4057_2225658","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Luke xxiv. 13-28.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":24,"verses":[13]}]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4058_2226621","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"1 Cor. xi. 29.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":11,"verses":[29]}]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4059_2227021","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Acts ii. 41.","bible_refs":[{"book":"the acts","chapter":2,"verses":[41]}]}]},{"text":"2. But what did the Lord show written of Him in the Law of Moses, and the Prophets, and the Psalms? What did He show? Let Himself say. The evangelist has put this briefly, that we might know what in all that great compass of the Scriptures we ought to believe and to understand. Certainly there are many pages, and many books; the contents of them all is this which the Lord briefly spake to His disciples. What is this? That \"it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise again the third day.\" Thou hast it now concerning the Bridegroom, that \"it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise again:\" the Bridegroom has been set forth to us. Concerning the Bride, let us see what He saith; that thou, when thou knowest the Bridegroom and the Bride, mayest not without reason come to the marriage. For every celebration is a celebration of marriage: the Church's nuptials are celebrated. The King's Son is about to marry a wife, and that King's Son is Himself a King: and the guests frequenting the marriage are themselves the Bride. Not, as in a carnal marriage, some are guests, and another is she that is married; in the Church they that come as guests, if they come to good purpose, become the Bride. For all the Church is Christ's Bride, of which the beginning and first fruits is the flesh of Christ: there was the Bride joined to the Bridegroom in the flesh. With good reason when He would betoken that same flesh, He brake bread, and with good reason \"in the breaking of bread,\" the eyes \"of the disciples were opened, and they knew Him.\" Well then, what did the Lord say was written of Him in the Law and Prophets and Psalms? That \"it behoved Christ to suffer.\" Had He not added, \"and to rise again,\" well might those mourn whose eyes were holden; but \"to rise again\" is also foretold. And wherefore this? Why did it behove Christ to suffer and to rise again? Because of that Psalm which we especially commended to your attention on the fourth day, the first station, of last week.[fn-40-P4061_2230537:6-nf] Why did it behove Christ to suffer and to rise again? For this reason: \"All the ends of the earth shall be reminded and converted unto the Lord, and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before Him.\"[fn-40-P4062_2230796:7-nf] For that ye may know that it behoved Christ to suffer and to rise again; in this place also what hath He added, that after setting forth the Bridegroom He might also set forth the Bride? \"And that there be preached,\" saith He, \"in His name, repentance and remission of sins throughout all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.\" Ye have heard, brethren; hold it fast. Let no man doubt concerning the Church, that it is \"throughout all nations:\" let no man doubt that it began at Jerusalem, and hath filled all nations. We know the field where the Vine is planted: but when it is grown we know it not, because it has taken up the whole. Whence did it begin? \"At Jerusalem.\" Whither has it come? To \"all nations.\" A few remain: it shall possess all. In the mean time, while it is taking possession of all, it has seemed good to the Husbandman to cut off some unprofitable branches, and they have made heresies and schisms. Let not the branches that are cut off induce you to be cut off: rather exhort ye them that are cut off that they be grafted in again. It is manifest that Christ hath suffered, is risen again, andis ascended into heaven: made manifest alsois the Church, because there is \"preached in His name repentance and remission of sins throughout all nations.\" Whence did it begin? \"Beginning at Jerusalem.\" The man hears this; foolish and vain, and (how, shall I express it?) worse than blind! so great a mountain, and he does not see it; a candle set upon a candlestick, and he shuts his eyes against it!","index":"5","references":[{"fn":"40","code":"P4061_2230537","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Tertull. de Jejun., sec. 14; de Orat. sec. 14.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4062_2230796","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Ps. xxii. 27.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":22,"verses":[27]}]}]},{"text":"3. When we say to them, If ye be Catholic Christians, communicate with that Church from which the Gospel is spread abroad over the whole earth: communicate with that Jerusalem:[fn-40-P4064_2232500:8-nf] when this we say to them, they make answer to us, we do not communicate with that city where our King was slain, where our Lord was slain: as though they hate the city where our Lord was slain. The Jews slew Him whom they found on earth, these scorn[fn-40-P4065_2232799:9-nf] Him that sitteth in heaven! Which are the worse; those who despised Him because they thought Him man, or those who scorn the sacraments of Him whom now they confess to be God? But they hate, forsooth, the city in which their Lord was slain ious men, and merciful! they much grieve that Christ was slain, and in men they slay Christ! But He loved that city, and pitied it: from it He bade the preaching of Him begin, \"beginning at Jerusalem.\" He made there the beginning of the preaching of His name: and thou shrinkest back with horror from having communion with that city![fn-40-P4066_2233409:10-nf] No marvel that being cut off thou hatest the root. What said He to His disciples? \"Sit ye still in the city, because I send my promise[fn-40-P4067_2233797:11-nf] upon you.\" Behold what the city is that they hate! Haply they would love it, if Christ's murderers dwelt in it. For it is manifest that all Christ's murderers, i.e., the Jews, are expelled from that city.[fn-40-P4068_2234029:12-nf] That which had in it them that were fierce against Christ, hath now them that adore Christ. Therefore do these men hate it, because Christians are in it. There was it His will that His disciples should tarry, and there that He should send to them the Holy Ghost. Where had the Church its commencement, but where the Holy Ghost came from heaven, and filled the hundred and twenty sitting in one place? That number twelve was made tenfold. They sat, an hundred and twenty persons, and the Holy Ghost came, \"and filled the whole place, and there came a sound, as it were the rushing of a mighty wind, and there were cloven tongues like as of fire.\" Ye have heard the Acts of the Apostles: this was the lesson read today:[fn-40-P4069_2234795:13-nf] \"They began to speak with tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.\" And all who were on the spot, Jews who were come from divers nations, recognised each his own tongue, and marvelled that those unlearned and ignorant men had on the sudden learned not one or two tongues, but the tongues of all nations whatsoever. There, then, where all tongues sounded, there was it betokened that all tongues should believe. But these men, who much love Christ, and therefore refuse to communicate with the city which i killed Christ, so honor Christ as to affirm that He is left to two tongues, the Latin and the Punic, i.e. African. Christ possess only two tongues! For there are but these two tongues on the side of Donatus, more they have not. Let us awake, my brethren, let us rather see the gift of the Spirit of God, and let us believe the things spoken before concerning Him, and let us see fulfilled the things spoken before in the Psalm: \"There are neither speeches nor discourses,[fn-40-P4070_2235892:14-nf] but their voices are heard among them.[fn-40-P4071_2235959:15-nf] And lest haply the case be so that the tongues themselves came to one place, and not rather that the gift of Christ came to all tongues, hear what follows: \"Into all the earth is their sound gone out, and unto the ends of the world their words.\" Wherefore this? Because \"in the sun hath He set His tabernacle,\" i.e., in the open light. His tabernacle, His flesh: His tabernacle, His Church: \"in the sun\" it is set; not in the night, but in the day. But why do those not acknowledge it? Return to the lesson at the place where it ended yesterday, and see why they do not acknowledge it: \"He that hateth his brother, walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because the darkness hath blinded his eyes.\" For us then, let us see what follows, and not be in darkness. How shall we not be in darkness? If we love the brethren. How is it proved that we love the brotherhood? By this, that we do not rend unity, that we hold fast charity.","index":"6","references":[{"fn":"40","code":"P4064_2232500","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"S. Aug. Ep. c. Donat. de Unit.

For this the bridegroom gives earnest, that in his earnest he may himself be loved. Well then, God gave thee all these things: love Him that made them.

But in what way repelled He the tempter, and taught his soldier how to fight? Mark what He said to him: \"Not by bread alone doth man live, but by every word of God.\" He was tempted also by the lust of the eyes concerning a miracle, when he said to Him, \"Cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.\" He resisted the tempter, for to do the miracle, would only have been to seem either to have yielded, or to have done it from curiosity; for He wrought when He would, as God, howbeit as healing the weak. For if He had done it then, He might have been thought to wish only to do a miracle. But lest men should think this, mark what He answered; and when the like temptation shall happen to thee, say thou also the same: \"Get thee behind me, Satan; for it is written, Thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God:\" that is, if I do this I shall tempt God. He said what He would have thee to say. When the enemy suggests to thee, \"What sort of man, what sort of Christian, art thou? As yet hast thou done one miracle, or by thy prayers have the dead been raised, or hast thou healed the fevered? if thou wert truly of any moment, thou wouldest do some miracle:\" answer and say: \"It is written, Thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God:\" therefore I will not tempt God, as if I should belong to God if I do a miracle, and not belong if I do none: and what becomes then of His words, \"Rejoice, because your names are written in heaven\"?

When he carried Him up to an high place, and said to Him, \"All these will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.\" By the loftiness of an earthly kingdom he wished to tempt the King of all worlds: but the Lord who made heaven and earth trod the devil under foot. What great matter for the devil to be conquered by the Lord? Then what did He in the answer He made to the devil but teach thee the answer He would have thee to make? \"It is, written, Thou shall worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shall thou serve.\" Holding these things fast, ye shall not have the concupiscence of the world: by not having concupiscence of the world, neither shall the lust of the flesh, nor the lust of the eyes, nor the pride of life, subjugate you: and ye shall make place for Charity when she cometh, that ye may love God.
