Ye remember, brethren, that yesterday's lesson was brought to a close at this point, that \"ye have no need that any man teach you, but the unction itself teacheth you concerning all things.\" Now this, as I am sure ye remember, we so expounded to you, that we who from without speak to your ears, are as workmen applying culture from without to a tree, but we cannot give the increasenor form the fruits: but only He that created and redeemed and called you, He, dwelling in you by faith and the Spirit, must speak to you within, else vain is all our noise of words. Whence does this appear? From this: that while many hear, not all are persuaded of that which is said, but only they to whom God speaks within. Now they to whom He speaks within, are those who give place to Him: and those give place to God, who \"give not place to the devil.\"[fn-42-P4210_2295574:1-nf] For the devil wishes to inhabit the hearts of men, and speak there the things which are able to seduce.

Nay, but out of the hearts of the believing. The invader being cast out, let the Redeemer dwell within: because the same redeemed, who created.

And whither were they sent? Ye heard while the Gospel was read, \"Go, preach the Gospel to the whole creation which is under heaven.\"[fn-42-P4215_2297232:5-nf] Consequently, the disciples were sent \"every where:\" with signs and wonders to attest that what they spake, they had seen.

Perfect righteousness is not, save only in the angels: and scarce in angels, if they be compared with God: yet if there be any perfect righteousness of souls and spirits which God hath created, it is in the angels, holy, just, good, by no lapse turned aside, by no pride falling, but remaining ever in the contemplation of the Word of God, and having nothing else sweet unto them save Him by whom they were created; in them is perfect righteousness: but in us it has begun to be, of faith, by the Spirit. Ye heard when the Psalm was read,\"Begin[fn-42-P4222_2299779:11-nf] to the Lord in confession.\"[fn-42-P4223_2299857:12-nf] \"Begin,\" saith it; the beginning of our righteousness is the confession of sins. Thou hast begun not to defend thy sin; now hast thou made a beginning of righteousness: but it shall be perfected in thee when to do nothing else shall delight thee, when \"death shall be swallowed up in victory,\"[fn-42-P4224_2300171:13-nf] when there shall be no itching of lust, when there shall be no struggling with flesh and blood, when there shall be the palm of victory, the triumph over the enemy; then shall there be perfect righteousness. At present we are still fighting: if we fight we are in the lists;[fn-42-P4225_2300466:14-nf] we smite and are smitten; but who shall conquer, remains to be seen. And that man conquers, who even when he smites presumes not on his own strength, but relies upon God that cheers him on. The devil is alone when he fights against us. If we are with God, we overcome the devil: for if thou fight alone with the devil, thou wilt be overcome. He is a skillful enemy: how may palms has he won! Consider to what he has cast us down t That we are born mortal, comes of this, that he in the first place cast down from Paradise our very original. What then is to be done, seeing he is so well practised? Let the Almighty be invoked to thine aid against the devices of the devil. Let Him dwell in thee, who cannot be overcome, and thou shalt securely overcome him who is wont to overcome. But to overcome whom? Those in whom God dwelleth not. For, that ye may know it, brethren; Adam being in Paradise despised the commandment of God, and lifted up the neck, as if he desired to be his own master, and were loath to be subject to the will of God: so he fell from that immortality, from that blessedness. But there was a certain man, a man now well skilled, though a mortal born, who even as he sat on the dunghill, purifying with worms, overcame the devil: yea, Adam himself then overcame: even he, in Job; because Job was of his race. So then, Adam, overcome in Paradise, overcame on the dunghill. Being in Paradise, he gave ear to the persuasion of the woman which the devil had put into her: but being on the dunghill he said to Eve, \"Thou hast spoken as one of the foolish women.\"[fn-42-P4226_2302058:15-nf] There he lent an ear, here he gave an answer: when he was glad, he listened, when he was scourged, he overcame. Therefore, see what follows, my brethren, in the Epistle: because this is what it would have us lay to heart, that we may overcome the devil indeed, but not of ourselves. \"If ye know that He is righteous,\" saith it, \"know ye that every one that doeth righteousness is born of Him:\" of God, of Christ. And in that he hath said, \"Is born of Him,\" he cheers us on.

Ye must know what means that \"as:\" thus he said a while ago, \"Purifieth himself even as He is pure.\" Then is our purity like and equal to the purity of God, and our righteousness to God's righteousness? Who can say this? But the word \"as,\" is not always wont to be used in the sense of equality. As, for example, if, having seen this large church,[fn-42-P4265_2316245:48-nf] a person should wish to build a smaller church, but with the same relative dimensions: as, for example, if this be one measure in width and two measures in length, he too should build his church one measure in width and two measures in length: in that case one sees that he has built it \"as\" this is built. But this church has, say, a hundred cubits in length, the other thirty: it is at once \"as\" this, and yet unequal. Ye see that this \"as\" is not always referred to parity and equality. For example, see what a difference there is between the face of a man and its image from a mirror: there is a face in the image, a face in the body: the image exists in imitation, the body in reality. And what do we say? Why, \"as\" there are eyes here, so also there; \"as\" ears here, so ears also there. The thing is different, but the \"as\" is said of the resemblance. Well then, we also have in us the image of God; but not that which the Son equal with the Father hath: yet except we also, according to our measure, were \"as\" He, we should in no respect be said to be like Him. \"He purifieth us,\" then, \"even as He is pure:\" but He is pure from eternity, we pure by faith. We are \"righteous even as He is righteous;\" but He is so in His immutable perpetuity, we righteous by believing on One we do not see, that so we may one day see Him.
