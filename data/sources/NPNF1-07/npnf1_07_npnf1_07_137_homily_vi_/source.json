And this is His commandment, That we should believe on the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as He gave us commandment. And he that keepeth His commandments shall dwell in Him, and He in him. And herein we know that He abideth in us, by the Holy Spirit which He hath given us. Dearly beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into this world. In this is known the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is the antichrist, of whom ye have heard that he should come; and even now already is he in this world.\"","index":"3","references":[]},{"text":"1. If ye remember, brethren, yesterday we closed our sermon at this sentence,[fn-43-P4347_2353334:1-nf] which without doubt behooved and does behoove to abide in your heart, seeing it was the last ye heard. \"My little children, let us not love only in word and in tongue; but in deed and in truth.\" Then he goes on: \"And herein we know that we are of the truth, and assure our hearts before Him.\"[fn-43-P4348_2353649:2-nf] \"For if our heart[fn-43-P4349_2353717:3-nf] think ill of us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.\" He had said,\" Let us not love only in word and in tongue, but in work and in truth:\" we are asked, In what work, or in what truth, is he known that loveth God, or loveth his brother? Above he had said up to what point charity is perfected: what the Lord saith in the Gospel, \"Greater love than this hath no man, that one lay down his life for his friends,\"[fn-43-P4350_2354165:4-nf] this same had the apostle also said: \"As He laid down His life for us, we ought also to lay down our lives for the brethren.\"[fn-43-P4351_2354307:5-nf] This is the perfection of charity, and greater can not at all be found. But because it is not perfect in all, and that man ought not to despair in whom it is not perfect, if that be already born which may be perfected: and of course if born, it must be nourished, and by certain nourishments of its own must be brought unto its proper perfection: therefore, we have asked concerning the commencement of charity, where it begins, and there have straightway found: \"But whoso hath this world's goods, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of the Father in him?\"[fn-43-P4352_2354954:6-nf] Here then hath this charity, my brethren, its beginning: to give of one's superfluities to him that hath need to him that is in any distress; of one's temporal abundance to deliver his brother from temporal tribulation. Here is the first rise of charity. This, being thus begun, if thou shalt nourish with the word of God and hope of the life to come, thou wilt come at last unto that perfection, that thou shalt be ready to lay down thy life for thy brethren.","index":"4","references":[{"fn":"43","code":"P4347_2353334","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"1 John iii. 18-20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 john","chapter":3,"verses":[18]}]},{"fn":"43","code":"P4348_2353649","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Better, \"judge ill,\" i.e., condemn.-J.

But, because many such things are done by men who seek other objects, and who love not the brethren; let us come back to the testimony of conscience. How do we prove that many such things are done by men who love not the brethren? How many in heresies and schisms call themselves martyrs! They seem to themselves to lay down their lives for their brethren. If for the brethren they laid down their lives, they would not separate themselves from the whole brotherhood. Again, how many there are who for the sake of vainglory bestow much, give much, and seek therein but the praise of men and popular glory, which is full of windiness, and possesses no stability! Seeing, then, there are such, where shall be the proof of brotherly charity? Seeing he wished it to be proved, and hath said by way of admonition, \"My little children, let us not love only in word and in tongue; but in deed and in truth;\" we ask, in what work, in what truth? Can there be a more manifest work than to give to the poor? Many do this of vainglory, not of love. Can there be a greater work than to die for the brethren? This also, many would fain be thought to do, who do it of vainglory to get a name, not from bowels of love. It remains, that that man loves his brother, who before God, where God alone seeth, assures his own heart, and questions his. heart whether he does this indeed for love of the brethren; and his witness is that eye which penetrates the heart, where man cannot look. Therefore Paul the Apostle, because he was ready to die for the brethren, and said, \"I will myself be spent for your souls,\"[fn-43-P4354_2357031:7-nf] yet, because God only saw this in his heart, not the mortal men to whom he spake, he saith to them, \"But to me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you or at man's bar.\"[fn-43-P4355_2357235:8-nf] And the same apostle shows also in a certain place, that these things are oft done of empty vainglory, not upon the solid ground of love: for speaking of the praises of charity he saith, \"If I distribute all my goods to the poor. and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\"[fn-43-P4356_2357572:9-nf] Is it possible for a man to do this without charity? It is. For they that have divided unity, are persons that have not charity. Seek there, and ye shall see many giving much to the poor; shallsee others prepared to welcome death, insomuch that where there is no persecutor they cast themselves headlong: these doubtless without charity do this. Let us come back then to conscience, of which the apostle saith: \"For our glorying is this, the testimony of our conscience.\"[fn-43-P4357_2358064:10-nf] Let us come back to conscience, of which the same saith, \"But let each prove his own work, and then he shall have glorying in himself and not in another.\"[fn-43-P4358_2358238:11-nf] Therefore, let each one of us \"prove his own work,\" whether it flow forth from the vein of charity, whether it be from charity as the root that his good works sprout forth as branches. \"But let each prove his own work, and then he shall have glorying in himself and not in another,\" not when another's tongue bears witness to him, but when his own conscience bears it.","index":"5","references":[{"fn":"43","code":"P4354_2357031","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"2 Cor. xii. 15.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":12,"verses":[15]}]},{"fn":"43","code":"P4355_2357235","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"1 Cor. iv. 3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":4,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"43","code":"P4356_2357572","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"1 Cor. xiii. 3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":13,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"43","code":"P4357_2358064","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"2 Cor. i. 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":1,"verses":[12]}]},{"fn":"43","code":"P4358_2358238","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Gal. vi. 4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"galatians","chapter":6,"verses":[4]}]}]},{"text":"3.

Look within, for man cannot judge whom he cannot see.

Wilt thou hear counsel? If thou wouldest flee from Him, flee to Him. Flee to Him by confessing, not from Him by hiding: hide thou canst not, but confess thou canst.

Let thy conscience bear thee witness that thy love is of God. If it be of God, do not wish to display it before men; because neither men's praises lift thee unto heaven, nor their censures put thee down from thence.

Just as, where it was said of sin, \"He that is born of God sinneth not:\" we found this sin to be the violating of charity, and that this was the thing strictly intended in that place: so too we ask now what it is that he would say. For if thou look but to the words, it seems plain: if thou take the examples into the account, it is obscure. Than the words here nothing can be plainer. \"And whatsoever we ask, we shall receive of Him, because we keep His commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.\" \"Whatsoever we ask,\" saith he, \"we shall receive of Him.\" He hath put us sorely to straits.

Were the Jews innocent when He came to them, because He so speaks? Then if He had not come, would they have had no sin? Then did the Physician's presence make one sick, not take away the fever? What madman even would say this? He came not but to cure and heal the sick. Therefore when He said, \"If I had not come, they had not had sin,\" what would He have to be understood, but a certain sin in particular? For there was a sin which the Jews would not have had. What sin? That they believed not on Him, that when he had come they despised Him. As then He there said \"sin,\" and it does not follow that we are to understand all sin, but a certain sin: so here also not all sin, lest it be contrary to that place where he saith, \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us:\"[fn-43-P4374_2365732:24-nf] but a certain sin in particular, that is, the violation of charity.

But let us distinguish God's different ways of hearing prayer. For we find some not heard for their wish, heard for salvation: and again some we find heard for their wish, not heard for salvation. Mark this difference, hold fast this example of a man not heard for his wish but heard for salvation. Hear the apostle Paul; for what is the hearing of prayer unto salvation, God Himself showed him: \"Sufficient for thee,\" saith He, \"is my grace; for strength is perfected in weakness.\" Thou hast besought, hast cried, hast thrice cried: the very cry thou didst raise once for all I heard, I turned not away mine ears from thee; I know what I should do: thou wouldest have it taken away, the healing thing by which thou art burned; I know the infirmity by which thou art burdened. Well then: here is a man who was heard for salvation, while as to his will he was not heard. Where find we persons heard for their will, not heard for salvation? Do we find, think we, some wicked, some impious man, heard of God for his will, not heard for salvation? If I put to you the instance of some man, perchance thou wilt say to me, \"It is thou that callest him wicked, for he was righteous; had he not been righteous, his prayer would not have been heard by God.\"The instance I am about to allege is of one, of whose iniquity and impiety none can doubt. The devil himself: he asked for Job, and received.[fn-43-P4379_2369045:27-nf] Have ye not here also heard concerning the devil, that \"he that committeth sin is of the devil\"?[fn-43-P4380_2369163:28-nf] Not that the devil created, but that the sinner imitates. Is it not said of him, \"He stood not in the truth\"?[fn-43-P4381_2369296:29-nf] Is not even he \"that old serpent,\" who, through the woman pledged the first man in the drink of poison?[fn-43-P4382_2369420:30-nf] Who even in the case of Job, kept for him his wife, that by her the husband might be, not comforted, but tempted? The devil asked for a holy man, to tempt him; and he received: the apostle asked that the thorn in the flesh might be taken from him, and he received not. But the apostle was more heard than the devil. For the apostle was heard for salvation, though not for his wish: the devil was heard for his wish, but for damnation. For that Job was yielded up to him to be tempted, was in order that by his standing the proof the devil should be tormented. But this, my brethren, we find not only in the Old Testament books, but also in the Gospel. The demons besought the Lord, when He expelled them from the man, that they might be permitted to go into the swine. Should the Lord not have power to tell them not to approach even those creatures? For, had it not been His will to permit this, they were not about to rebel against the King of heaven and earth. But with a view to a certain mystery, with a certain[fn-43-P4383_2370457:31-nf] ulterior meaning, He let the demons go into the swine: to show that the devil hath dominion in them that lead the life of swine.[fn-43-P4384_2370612:32-nf] Demons then were heard in their request; was the apostle not heard?

Learn to beseech God that ye may commit it to the Physician to do what He knows best. Do thou confess the disease, let Him apply the means of healing. Do thou only hold fast charity.

For there behooved to be that betokening of the Holy Spirit in all tongues, to shew that the Gospel of God was to run through all tongues over the whole earth. That thing was done for a betokening, and it passed away. In the laying on of hands now, that persons may receive the Holy Ghost, do we look that they should speak with tongues? Or when we laid the hand on these infants,[fn-43-P4399_2376713:44-nf] did each one of you look to see whether they would speak With tongues, and, when he saw that they did not speak with tongues, was any of you so wrong-minded as to say, These have not received the Holy Ghost; for, had they received, they would speak with tongues as was the case in those times? If then the witness of the presence of the Holy Ghost be not now given through these miracles, by what is it given, by what does one get to know that he has received the Holy Ghost?

What marvel that they are not with us? We are in one body, we have one Head, in heaven. Brethren, our two eyes do not see each other; as one may say, they do not know each other. But in the charity of the bodily frame do they not know each other? For, to shew you that in the charity which knits them together they do know each other; when both eyes are open, the right may not rest on some object, on which the left shall not rest likewise. Direct the glance of the right eye without the other, if thou canst. Together they meet in one object, together they are directed tone object: their aim is one, their places diverse.

Then if thou wouldest know that thou hast received the Spirit, question thine heart: lest haply thou have the sacrament, and have not the virtue of the sacrament. Question thine heart.

A hard matter has he put to us, my brethren! It is well for us that he should tell us himself how we are to discern them. He is about to tell us: fear not: but first see; mark: see that hereby is expressed the very thing that vain heretics[fn-44-P4403_2379452:47-nf] taunt us withal. Mark, see what he says, \"Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits whether they be from God.\" The Holy Spirit is spoken of in the Gospel by the name of water; where the Lord \"cried and said, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. He that believeth on me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.\"[fn-44-P4404_2379821:48-nf] But the evangelist has expounded of what He said this: for he goes on to say, \"But this spake He of the Spirit, which they that believed on Him should receive.\" Wherefore did not the Lord baptize many? But what saith he? \"For the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.\" Then seeing those had baptism, and had not yet received the Holy Ghost, whom on the day of Pentecost the Lord sent from heaven, the glorifying of the Lord was first waited for, so that the Spirit might be given. Even before He was glorified, and before He sent the Spirit, He yet invited men to prepare themselves for the receiving of the water of which He said, \"Whoso thirsteth, let him come and drink;\" and, \"He that believeth on me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.\" What meaneth, \"Rivers of living water\"? What is that water? Let no man ask me; ask the Gospel. \"But this,\" saith it, \"He said of the Spirit, which they should receive that should believe on Him.\" Consequently, the water of the sacrament is one thing: another, the water which betokens the Spirit of God. The water of the sacrament is visible: the water of the Spirit invisible. That washes the body, and betokens that which is done in the soul. By this Spirit the soul itself is cleansed and fed. This is the Spirit of God, which heretics and all that cut themselves off from the Church, cannot have. And whosoever do not openly cut themselves off, but by iniquity are cut off, and being within, whirl about as chaff and are not grain; these have not this Spirit. This Spirit is denoted by the Lord under the name of water: and we have heard from this epistle, \"Believe not every spirit;\" and those words of Solomon bear witness, \"From strange water keep thee far.\"[fn-44-P4405_2381603:49-nf] What meaneth, \"water\"? Spirit. Does water always signify spirit? Not always: but in some places it signifies the Spirit, in some places it signifies baptism, in some places signifies peoples,[fn-44-P4406_2381819:50-nf] in some places signifies counsel: thus thou findest it said in a certain place, \"Counsel is a fountain of life to them that possess it.\"[fn-44-P4407_2381976:51-nf] So then, in divers places of the Scriptures, the term \"water\" signifies divers things. Now however by the term water ye have heard the Holy Spirit spoken of, not by an interpretation of ours but by witness of the Gospel, where it saith, \"But this said He of the Spirit, which they should receive that should believe on Him.\" If then by the name of water is signified the Holy Spirit, and this epistle saith to us, \"Believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they be of God;\" let us understand that of this it is said, \"From strange water keep thee far, and from a strange fountain drink thou not.\"[fn-44-P4408_2382608:52-nf] What meaneth, \"From a strange fountain drink thou not\"?

Already ye have heard that it was said above, \"Whoso denieth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, the same is an antichrist.\" There also we asked, Who denies? because neither do we deny, nor do those deny. And we found that some do in their deeds deny;[fn-44-P4413_2385604:55-nf] and we brought testimony from the apostle, who saith, \"For they confess that they know God, but in their deedsdeny Him.\"[fn-44-P4414_2385752:56-nf] Thus then let us now also make the enquiry in the deeds not in the tongue. What is the spirit that is not from God? That \"which denieth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh.\" And what is the spirit that is from God? That \"which confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh.\" Who is he that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh? Now, brethren, to the mark! let us look to the works, not stop at the noise of the tongue. Let us ask why Christ came in the flesh, so we get at the persons who deny that He is come in the flesh. If thou stop at tongues, why, thou shalt hear many a heresy confessing that Christ is come in the flesh: but the truth convicteth those men. Wherefore came Christ in the flesh? Was He not God? Is it not written of Him, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God?\"[fn-44-P4415_2386614:57-nf] Was it not He that did feed angels, is it not He that doth feed angels? Did He not in such sort come hither, that He departed not thence? Did He not in such sort ascend, that He forsook not us? Wherefore then came He in the flesh? Because it behooved us to have the hope of resurrection shown unto us. God He was, and in flesh He came; for God could not die, flesh could die; He came then in the flesh, that He might die for us. But how died He for us? \"Greater charity than this hath no man, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\"[fn-44-P4416_2387171:58-nf] Charity therefore broughtHim to the flesh. Whoever therefore has not charity denies that Christ is come in the flesh. Here then do thou now question all heretics. Did Christ come in the flesh? \"He did come; this I believe, this I confess.\" Nay, this thou deniest. \"How do I deny? Thou hearest that I say it!\" Nay, I convict thee of denying it. Thou sayest with the voice, deniest with the heart; sayest in words, deniest in deeds. \"How,\" sayest thou, \"do I deny in deeds?\" Because the end for which Christ came in the flesh, was, that He might die for us. He died for us, because therein He taught much charity. \"Greater charity than this hath no man, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\" Thou hast not charity, seeing thou for thine own honor dividest unity. Therefore by this understand ye the spirit that is from God. Give the earthen vessels a tap, put them to the proof, whether haply they be cracked and give a dull sound: see whether they ring full and clear, see whether charity be there. Thou takest thyself away from the unity of the whole earth, thou dividest the Church by schisms, thou rendest the Body of Christ. He came in the flesh, to gather in one, thou makest an outcry to scatter abroad. This then is the Spirit, of God, which saith that Jesus is come in the fleshy which saith, not in tongue but in deeds, which saith, not by making a noise but by loving. And that spirit is not of God, which denies that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh I denies, here also, not in tongue but in life; not in words but in deeds.
