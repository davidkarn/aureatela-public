We have just read the long lesson of the man born blind, whom the Lord Jesus restored to the light; but were we to attempt handling the whole of it, and considering, according to our ability, each passage in a way proportionate to its worth, the day would be insufficient. Wherefore I ask and warn your Charity not to require any words of ours on those passages whose meaning is manifest; for it would be too protracted to linger at each. I proceed, therefore, to set forth briefly the mystery of this blind man's enlightenment. All, certainly, that was done by our Lord Jesus Christ, both works and words, are worthy of our astonishment and admiration: His works, because they are facts; His words, because they are signs. If we reflect, then, on what is signified by the deed here done, that blind man is the human race; for this blindness had place in the first mar, through sin, from whom we all draw our origin, not only in respect of death, but also of unrighteousness. For if unbelief is blindness, and faith enlightenment, whom did Christ find a believer at His coming? seeing that the apostle, belonging himself to the family of the prophets, says: \"And we also in times past were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.\"[fn-18-P1870_1172368:1-nf] If \"children of wrath,\" then children of vengeance, children of punishment, children of hell. For how is it \"by nature,\" save that through the first man sinning moral evil rooted itself in us as a nature? If evil has so taken root within us, every man is born mentally blind. For if he sees, he has no need of a guide. If he does need one to guide and enlighten him, then is he blind from his birth.","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"18","code":"P1870_1172368","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Eph. ii. 3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"ephesians","chapter":2,"verses":[3]}]}]},{"text":"2. The Lord came: what did He do? He set forth a great mystery. \"He spat on the ground,\" He made clay of His spittle; for the Word was made flesh.[fn-18-P1872_1172929:2-nf] \"And He anointed the eyes of the blind man.\" The anointing had taken place, and yet he saw not. He sent him to the pool which is called Siloam. But it was the evangelist's concern to call our attention to the name of this pool; and he adds, \"Which is interpreted, Sent.\" You understand now who it is that was sent; for had He not been sent, none of us would have been set free from iniquity. Accordingly he washed his eyes in that pool which is interpreted, Sent-he was baptized in Christ. If, therefore, when He baptized him in a manner in Himself, He then enlightened him; when He anointed Him, perhaps He made him a catechumen.[fn-18-P1873_1173576:3-nf] In many different ways indeed may the profound meaning of such a sacramental act be set forth and handled; but let this suffice your Charity. You have heard a great mystery. Ask a man, Are you a Christian? His answer to you is, I am not, if he is a pagan or a Jew. But if he says, I am; you inquire again of him, Are you a catechumen or a believer? If he reply, A catechumen; he has been anointed, but not yet washed. But how anointed? Inquire, and he will answer you. Inquire of him in whom he believes. In that very respect in which he is a catechumen he says, In Christ. See, I am speaking in a way both to the faithful and to catechumens. What have I said of the spittle and the clay? That the Word was made flesh. This even catechumens hear; but that to which they have been anointed is not all they need; let them hasten to the font if they are in search of enlightenment.","index":"4","references":[{"fn":"18","code":"P1872_1172929","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Chap. i. 14.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1873_1173576","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"The name given to one who was under instruction for baptism, and for entrance into the full privileges of church membership.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"3. And now, because of certain points in the lesson before us, let us run over the words of the Lord, and of the whole lesson itself rather than make them a theme of discourse. \"As He passed out, He saw a man who was blind;\" blind, not from any cause whatever, but \"from his birth.\" \"And His disciples asked Him, Rabbi.\" You know that \"Rabbi\" is Master. They called Him Master, because they desired to learn. The question, at all events, they proposed to the Lord as a master, \"Who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?\" Jesus answered, \"Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents,\" that he was born blind. What is this that He has said? If no man is sinless, were the parents of this blind man without sin? Was he himself either born without original sin, or had he committed none in the course of his lifetime? Because his eyes were closed, had his lusts lost their wakefulness? How many evils are done by the blind? From what evil does an evil mind abstain, even though the eyes are closed? He could not see, but he knew how to think, and perchance to lust after something which his blindness hindered him from attaining, and so still in his heart to be judged by the searcher of hearts. If, then, both his parents had sin, and the man himself had sin, wherefore said the Lord, \"Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents,\" but only in respect to the point on which he was questioned, \"that he was born blind\"? For his parents had sin; but not by reason of the sin itself did it come about that he was born blind. If, then, it was not through the parents' sin that he was born blind, why was he born blind? Listen to the Master as He teaches. He seeks one who believes, to give him understanding. He Himself tells us the reason why that man was born blind: \"Neither hath this man sinned,\" He says, \"nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.\"","index":"5","references":[]},{"text":"4. And then, what follows? \"I must work the works of Him that sent me.\" See, here is that sent one [Siloam], wherein the blind man washed his face. And see what He said: \"I must work the works of Him that sent me, while it is day.\" Recall to thy mind the way in which He gives universal glory to Him of whom He is:[fn-18-P1876_1176802:4-nf] for that One has the Son who is of Him; He Himself has no One of whom He is.[fn-18-P1877_1176964:5-nf] But wherefore, Lord, saidst Thou, \"While it is day\"? Hearken why He did so. \"The night cometh when no man can work.\" Not even Thou, Lord. Will that night have such power that not even Thou, whose work the night is, wilt be able to work therein? For I think, Lord Jesus, nay I do not think, but believe and hold it sure, that Thou wast there when God said, \"Let there be light, and there was light.\"[fn-18-P1878_1177448:6-nf] For if He made it by the Word, He made it by Thee: and therefore it is said, \"All things were made by Him; and without Him was nothing made.\"[fn-18-P1879_1177604:7-nf] \"God divided between the light and the darkness: the light He called Day, and the darkness He called Night.\"[fn-18-P1880_1177728:8-nf] ","index":"6","references":[{"fn":"18","code":"P1876_1176802","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Or, \"from whom He proceeds.\" The Son is of the Father, but the Father is of none.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1877_1176964","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Or, \"from whom He proceeds.\" The Son is of the Father, but the Father is of none.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1878_1177448","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Gen. i. 3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":1,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1879_1177604","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Chap. i. 3.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1880_1177728","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Gen. i. 4, 5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":1,"verses":[4]}]}]},{"text":"5. What is that night wherein, when it comes, no one shall be able to work? Hear what the day is, and then thou wilt understand what the night is. But how shall we hear what the day is? Let Himself tell us: \"As long as I am in this world, I am the light of the world.\" See, He Himself is the day. Let the blind man wash his eyes in the day, that he may behold the day. \"As long,\" He says, \"as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\" Then will it be night of a kind unknown to me, when Christ will no longer be there; and so no one will be able to work. An inquiry remains, my brethren; patiently listen to me as I inquire. With you I inquire: With you shall I find Him to whom my inquiry is addressed. We are agreed; for it is expressly and definitely stated that the Lord proclaimed Himself in this place as the day, that is, the light of the world. \"As long,\" He says, \"as I am in this world, I am the light of the world.\" Therefore He Himself works. But how long is He in this world? Are we to think, brethren, that He was here then, and is here no longer? If we think so, then already, after the Lord's ascension, did that fearful night begin, when no one can work.

Hearken, then, why it is also night. Of a certain servant He says, \"Bind ye him hand and foot, and cast him into outer darkness.\"[fn-18-P1888_1180320:14-nf] Let man, then, work while he liveth, that he may not be overtaken by that night when no man can work.

It is Himself who hath said, 'Lo, I am with you.\" How long? Let there be no anxiety in us who are alive; were it possible, with this very word we might place in perfect security the generations still to come. \"Lo,\" He says,\" I am with you always, even to the end of the world.\"[fn-18-P1889_1180871:15-nf] That day, which is completed by the circuit of yonder sun, has but few hours; the day of Christ's presence extends even to the end of the world.
