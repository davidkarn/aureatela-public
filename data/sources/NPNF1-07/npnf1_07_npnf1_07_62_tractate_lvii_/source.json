I Have not been unmindful of my debt, and acknowledge that the time of payment has now come. May He give me wherewith to pay, as He gave me cause to incur the debt. For He has given me the love, of which it is said, \"Owe no man anything, but to love one another.\"[fn-24-P2428_1460692:1-nf] May He give also the word, which I feel myself owing to those I love. I put off your expectations till now for this reason, that I might explain as I could how it is we come to Christ along the ground, When we are commanded rather to seek the things which are above, not the things which are upon the earth.[fn-24-P2429_1461017:2-nf] For Christ is sitting above, at the right hand of the Father: but He is assuredly here also; and for that reason said also to Saul, as he was raging on the earth, \"Why persecutest thou me?\"[fn-24-P2430_1461226:3-nf] But the topic on which we were speaking, and which led to our entering on this inquiry, was our Lord's washing His disciples' feet, after the disciples themselves had already been washed, and needed not, save to wash their feet. And we there saw it to be understood that a man is indeed wholly washed in baptism; but while thereafter he liveth in this present world, and with the feet of his human passions treadeth on this earth, that is, in his life-intercourse with others, he contracts enough to call forth the prayer, \"Forgive us our debts.\"[fn-24-P2431_1461788:4-nf] And thus from these also is he cleansed by Him who washed His disciples' feet,[fn-24-P2432_1461884:5-nf] and ceaseth not to make intercession for us.[fn-24-P2433_1461947:6-nf] And here occurred the words of the Church in the Song of Songs, when she saith, \"I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?\" when she wished to go and open to that Being, fairer in form than the sons of men,[fn-24-P2434_1462178:7-nf] who had come to her and knocked, and asked her to open to Him. This gave rise to a question, which we were unwilling to compress into the narrow limits of the time, and therefore deferred till now, in what sense the Church, when on her way to Christ, may be afraid of defiling her feet, which she had washed in the baptism of Christ.","index":"3","references":[{"fn":"24","code":"P2428_1460692","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Rom. xiii. 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":13,"verses":[8]}]},{"fn":"24","code":"P2429_1461017","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Col. iii. 1, 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"colossians","chapter":3,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"24","code":"P2430_1461226","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Acts ix. 4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"the acts","chapter":9,"verses":[4]}]},{"fn":"24","code":"P2431_1461788","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Matt. vi. 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":6,"verses":[12]}]},{"fn":"24","code":"P2432_1461884","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Chap. xiii. 5.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"24","code":"P2433_1461947","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Rom. viii. 34.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":8,"verses":[34]}]},{"fn":"24","code":"P2434_1462178","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Ps. xlv. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":45,"verses":[2]}]}]},{"text":"2.

Therefore, as the Apostle James saith, \"Let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak.\"[fn-24-P2444_1464663:15-nf] As it is also said by another manof God, \"Thou wilt make me to hear joy and gladness; and the bones Thou hast humbled will rejoice.\"[fn-24-P2445_1464813:16-nf] This is what I said: When the truth is heard, humility is preserved. And another says: \"But the friend of the bridegroom standeth and heareth him, and rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice.\"[fn-24-P2446_1465034:17-nf] Let us rejoice in the hearing that comes from the noiseless speaking of the truth within us. For although, when the sound is outwardly uttered, as by one that readeth; or proclaimeth, or preacheth, or disputeth, or commandeth, or comforteth, or exhorteth, or even by one that sings or accompanies hisvoice on an instrument, those who do so may fear to defile their feet, when they aim at pleasing men with the secretly active desire of human applause. Yet the one who hears such with a willing and pious mind, has no room for self-gratulation in the labors of others; and with no self-inflation, but with the joy of humility, rejoices because of the Master's words of truth. Accordingly, in those who hear with willingness and humility, and spend a tranquil life in sweet and wholesome studies, the holy Church will take delight, and may say, \"I sleep, andmy heart waketh.\" And what is this, \"I sleep, and my heart waketh,\" but just I sit down quietly to listen? My leisure is not laid out in nourishing slothfulness, but in acquiring wisdom. \"I sleep, and my heart waketh.\" I am still, and see that Thou art the Lord:[fn-24-P2447_1466173:18-nf] for \"the wisdom of the scribe cometh by opportunity of leisure; and he that hath little business shall become wise.\"[fn-24-P2448_1466309:19-nf] \"I sleep, and my heart waketh:\" I rest from troublesome business, and my mind turns its attention to divine concerns (or communications).[fn-24-P2449_1466473:20-nf] ","index":"5","references":[{"fn":"24","code":"P2444_1464663","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Jas. 1. 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"james","chapter":1,"verses":[19]}]},{"fn":"24","code":"P2445_1464813","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Ps. li. 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":51,"verses":[8]}]},{"fn":"24","code":"P2446_1465034","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Chap. iii. 29.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"24","code":"P2447_1466173","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Ps. xlvi. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":46,"verses":[10]}]},{"fn":"24","code":"P2448_1466309","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Ecclus. xxxviii. 24.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"24","code":"P2449_1466473","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"Two readings, affectibus or affatibus.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"4.

Hence it happens that those who love to devote their leisure to good studies, and shrink from encountering the troubles of toilsome labors, as feeling themselves unsuited to undertake and discharge such services with credit, would prefer, were it possible, to have the holy apostles and ancient preachers of the truth again raised up against that abounding of iniquity which hath so reduced the warmth of Christian love. But in regard to those who have already left the body, and put off the garment of the flesh (for they are not utterly parted), the Church replies, \"I have put off my dress; how shall I put it on?\" That dress shall, indeed, yet be recovered; and in the persons of those who have meanwhile laid it aside, shall the Church again put on the garment of flesh: only not now, when the cold are needing to be warmed; but then, when the dead shall rise again. Realizing, then, her present difficulty through the scarcity of preachers, and remembering those members of her own who were so sound in word and holy in character, but are now disunited from their bodies,the Church says in her sorrow, \"I have put off my dress; how shall I put it on?\" How can those members of mine, who had such surpassing power, through their preaching, to open the door to Christ, now return to the bodies which they have laid aside?","index":"7","references":[]},{"text":"6.
