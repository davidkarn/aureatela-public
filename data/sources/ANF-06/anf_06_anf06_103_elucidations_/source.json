I follow Neale, however, as follows: Athanasius places its origin a.d. 306 (according to Tillemont and Baronius) or a.d. 301; the latter more probable, as demonstrated by the Benedictine editors. But the dates are, perhaps, the least of the difficulties which encumber the whole matter. Somewhat distrustfully I have, after several efforts to construct an original elucidation, adopted the theory of Neale, as a diligent and conscientious inquirer whose Oriental studies qualify him to utter almost a decisive voice, albeit he never forgets his Occidentalism, and hence fails to speak with absolute fidelity to the spirit of Catholic antiquity.","index":"6","references":[]},{"text":"We know something of Lycopolis from the blessed Alexander; it seems to have been a sort of centre to the bishoprics of the Thebais. It was just the sort of centre, in a region sufficient for a separate patriarchate, to suggest to an ambitious and unscrupulous prelate an effort at independency. Meletius, who succeeded the good Alexander, was just the man to set up for himself; a man not unlikely to be stimulated by the bad example of Paul of Samosata, and by the ingenuity that triumphed over the first council that called Paul to account. Bearing all this in mind, we may accept Neale's conviction that Meletius had long been a scandal to the churches, and in the time of persecution had lapsed, and sacrificed to idols. Peter summoned him to a council, by which he was convicted and degraded; whereupon he not only refused to submit, but arrogated to himself the cathedra of Alexandria, and began to ordain other bishops, and, in short, to reorganize its jurisdiction.[fn-45-P4566_1376222:41-nf] Owing, I think probable, to the exceptional and overgrown extent of this enormous \"patriarchate,\" as it was called a little later, the schism gained a considerable following. The distance of Lycopolis from Lower Egypt must have favoured the attempt, and Peter's recent accession made it easy for Meletius to circulate evil stories against him. The schism, as usual, soon developed into heresy, which even the Nicene Synod failed to extinguish. Arius had joined the first outbreak, but conformed for a time, and was ordained a deacon by Achillas. His troublesome spirit, however, soon showed itself again after his ordination to the priesthood; and the remnant of the Meletians made common cause with him after his condemnation at Nicaea. Of Peter's legitimate exercise of authority, and of the impurity and wickedness of Meletius before his invasion of Alexandria, there is no reason to doubt; but for the details, recourse must be had to Neale.[fn-45-P4567_1377279:42-nf] The famous Sixth Canon of Nice finds its explanation in this rebellion; but, incidentally, it defines the position of other great centres, which now began to be known as patriarchates. Neale's remarks[fn-45-P4568_1377534:43-nf] on the excessive leniency of the council in settling the case of Meletius, are specially to be noted.","index":"7","references":[{"fn":"45","code":"P4566_1376222","folder":"ANF-06","text":"He reported to the Nicene Council that he had ordained twenty-eight bishops and eight priests or deacons.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"45","code":"P4567_1377279","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Patriarchate of Alexandria, vol. i. pp. 91, 146.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"45","code":"P4568_1377534","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Ibid., p. 146.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"\nII","index":"8","references":[]},{"text":"Canonical Epistle, p. 279.","index":"9","references":[]},{"text":"The judgment of Dupin is so exceptionally eulogistic touching these canons, that I quote it, as follows:[fn-45-P4573_1377788:44-nf] -","index":"10","references":[{"fn":"45","code":"P4573_1377788","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Eccl.
