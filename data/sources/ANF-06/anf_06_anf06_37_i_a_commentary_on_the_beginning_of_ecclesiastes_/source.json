Consequently he shows the vanity of it, as what follows in like manner demonstrates: \"And my heart uttered[fn-18-P1894_550343:7-nf] many things: I knew wisdom, and knowledge, and parables, and sciences.\" But this was not the genuine wisdom or knowledge, but that which, as Paul says, puffeth up. He spake, moreover, as it is written,[fn-18-P1895_550599:8-nf] three thousand parables. But these were not parables of a spiritual kind, but only such as fit the common polity of men; as, for instance, utterances about animals or medicines.

But he says also, \"He that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.\" For they search even into things deeper than these,-inquiring, for example, what necessity there is for fire to go upward, and for water to go downward; and when they have learned that it is because the one is light and the other heavy, they do but increase sorrow: for the question still remains, Why might it not be the very reverse?","index":"16","references":[{"fn":"18","code":"P1893_550110","folder":"ANF-06","text":"1 Cor. iii. 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":3,"verses":[19]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1894_550343","folder":"ANF-06","text":"ei[pe, for which ei\\de, \"discerned,\" is suggested.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1895_550599","folder":"ANF-06","text":"1 Kings iv. 32.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 kings","chapter":4,"verses":[32]}]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter II.","index":3,"paragraphs":[{"text":"Ver.

For neither was he any better in soul by reason of these things, nor by their means did he gain friendship with God. Necessarily he is led to speak also of the true riches and the abiding property. Being minded, therefore, to show what kinds of possessions remain with the possessor, and continue steadily and maintain themselves for him, he adds: \"Also my wisdom remained with me.\" For this alone remains, and all these other things, which he has already reckoned up, flee away and depart. Wisdom, therefore, remained with me, and I remained in virtue of it. For those other things fall, and also cause the fall of the very persons who run after them. But, with the intention of instituting a comparison between wisdom and those things which are held to be good among men, he adds these words, \"And whatsoever mine eyes desired, I kept not from them,\" and so forth; whereby he describes as evil, not only those toils which they endure who toil in gratifying themselves with pleasures, but those, too, which by necessity and constraint men have to sustain for their maintenance day by day, labouring at their different occupations in the sweat of their faces. For the labour, he says, is great; but the art[fn-19-P1916_555505:13-nf] by the labour is temporary, adding[fn-19-P1917_555553:14-nf] nothing serviceable among things that please. Wherefore there is no profit. For where there is no excellence there is no profit. With reason, therefore, are the objects of such solicitude but vanity, and the spirit's choice. Now this name of \"spirit\" he gives to the \"soul.\" For choice is a quality, not a motion.[fn-19-P1918_555910:15-nf] And David says: \"Into Thy hands I commit my spirit.\"[fn-19-P1919_555987:16-nf] And in good truth \"did my wisdom remain with me,\" for it made me know and understand, so as to enable me to speak of all that is not advantageous[fn-19-P1920_556151:17-nf] under the sun. If, therefore, we desire the righteously profitable, if we seek the truly advantageous, if in is our aim to be incorruptible, let us engage those labours which reach beyond the sun.
