For it is not enough to keep the body only undefiled, just as we should not show that we think more of the temple than of the image of the god; but we should care for the souls of men as being the divinities of their bodies, and adorn them with righteousness. And then do they most care for them and tend them when, striving untiringly to hear divine discourses, they do not desist until, wearing the doors of the wise,[fn-48-P4865_1463804:5-nf] they attain to the knowledge of the truth.","index":"10","references":[{"fn":"48","code":"P4865_1463804","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Ecclus. vi. 36.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"For as the putrid humours and matter of flesh, and all those things which corrupt it, are driven out by salt, in the same manner all the irrational appetites of a virgin are banished from the body by divine teaching. For it must needs be that the soul which is not sprinkled with the words of Christ, as with salt, should stink and breed worms, as King David, openly confessing with tears in the mountains, cried out, \"My wounds stink and are corrupt,\"[fn-48-P4867_1464318:6-nf] because he had not salted himself with the exercises of self-control, and so subdued his carnal appetites, but self-indulgently had yielded to them, and became corrupted in adultery. And hence, in Leviticus,[fn-48-P4868_1464571:7-nf] every gift, unless it be seasoned with salt, is forbidden to be offered as an oblation to the Lord God. Now the whole spiritual meditation of the Scriptures is given to us as salt which stings in order to benefit, and which disinfects, without which it is impossible for a soul, by means of reason, to be brought to the Almighty; for \"ye are the salt of the earth,\"[fn-48-P4869_1464966:8-nf] said the Lord to the apostles. It is fitting, then, that a virgin should always love things which are honourable, and be distinguished among the foremost for wisdom and addicted to nothing slothful or luxurious, but should excel, and set her mind upon things worthy of the state of virginity, always putting away, by the word, the foulness of luxury, lest in any way some slight hidden corruption should breed the worm of incontinence; for \"the unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord,\" how she may please the Lord, \"that she may be holy both in body and in spirit,\"[fn-48-P4870_1465559:9-nf] says the blessed Paul. But many of them who consider the hearing of the word quite a secondary matter, think they do great things if they give their attention to it for a little while. But discrimination must be exercised with respect to these; for it is not fitting to impart divine instruction to a nature which is careful about trifles, and low, and which counterfeits wisdom. For would it not be laughable to go on talking to those who direct all their energy towards things of little value, in order that they may complete most accurately those things which they want to bring to perfection, but do not think that the greatest pains are to be taken with those necessary things by which most of all the love of chastity would be increased in them?","index":"11","references":[{"fn":"48","code":"P4867_1464318","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Ps. xxxvii. 6 (LXX.), xxxviii. 5 (E.

Therefore the men of old times thought it nothing unseemly to take their own sisters for wives, until the law coming separated them, and by forbidding that which at first had seemed to be right, declared it to be a sin, calling him cursed who should \"uncover the nakedness\" of his sister;[fn-48-P4874_1467049:10-nf] God thus mercifully bringing to our race the needful help in due season, as parents do to their children.

And thus we must consider that the God and Father of all acted towards our forefathers. For the world, while still unfilled with men, was like a child, and it was necessary that it should first be filled with these, and so grow to manhood. But when hereafter it was colonized from end to end, the race of man spreading to a boundless extent, God no longer allowed man to remain in the same ways, considering how they might now proceed from one point to another, and advance nearer to heaven, until, having attained to the very greatest and most exalted lesson of virginity, they should reach to perfection; that first they should abandon the intermarriage of brothers and sisters, and marry wives from other families; and then that they should no longer have many wives, like brute beasts, as though born for the mere propagation of the species; and then that they should not be adulterers; and then again that they should go on to continence, and from continence to virginity, when, having trained themselves to despise the flesh, they sail fearlessly into the peaceful haven of immortality.[fn-48-P4875_1468622:11-nf] ","index":"13","references":[{"fn":"48","code":"P4874_1467049","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Lev. xviii. 19, xx. 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"leviticus","chapter":18,"verses":[19]}]},{"fn":"48","code":"P4875_1468622","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Contending with the worse than bestial sensuality of paganism, and inured to the sorrows of martyr-ages, when Christian families could not be reared in peace, let us not wonder at the high conceptions of these heroic believers, based on the words of Christ Himself, and on the promise, \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\"","bible_refs":[]}]}]},{"name":"Chapter III.-By the Circumcision of Abraham, Marriage with Sisters Forbidden; In the Times of the Prophets Polygamy Put a Stop To; Conjugal Purity Itself by Degrees Enforced.","index":4,"paragraphs":[{"text":"If, however, any one should venture to find fault with our argument as destitute of Scripture proof, we will bring forward the writings of the prophets, and more fully demonstrate the truth of the statements already made.

Let us then endeavour to speak of this as well as we can. And first let us inquire for what reason it was that no one of the many patriarchs and prophets and righteous men, who taught and did many noble things, either praised or chose the state of virginity. Because it was reserved for the Lord alone to he the first to teach this doctrine, since He alone, coming down to us, taught man to draw near to God; for it was fitting that He who was first and chief of priests, of prophets, and of angels, should also be saluted as first and chief of virgins.[fn-48-P4890_1472499:19-nf] For in old times man was not yet perfect, and for this reason was unable to receive perfection, which is virginity. For, being made in the Image of God, he needed to receive that which was according to His Likeness;[fn-48-P4891_1472833:20-nf] which the Word being sent down into the world to perfect. He first took upon Him our form, disfigured as it was by many sins, in order that we, for whose sake He bore it, might be able again to receive the divine form. For it is then that we are truly fashioned in the likeness of God, when we represent His features in a human life, like skilful painters, stamping them upon ourselves as upon tablets, learning the path which He showed us. And for this reason He, being God, was pleased to put on human flesh, so that we, beholding as on a tablet the divine Pattern of our life, should also be able to imitate Him who painted it. For He was not one who, thinking one thing, did another; nor, while He considered one thing to be right, taught another. But whatever things were truly useful and right, these He both taught and did.

He preserved the flesh which He had taken upon Him incorrupt in virginity, so that we also, if we world come to the likeness of God and Christ, should endeavour to honour virginity. For the likeness of God is the avoiding of corruption. And that the Word, when He was incarnate, became chief Virgin, in the same way as He was chief Shepherd and chief Prophet of the Church, the Christ-possessed John shows us, saying, in the Book of the Revelation, \"And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with Him an hundred forty and four thousand, having His name and His Father's name written in their foreheads. And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder; and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps: And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.

And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault,\"[fn-48-P4896_1475432:22-nf] he says, \"and they follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth.\" And he clearly intends by this to teach us that the number of virgins was, from the beginning, restricted to so many, namely, a hundred and forty and four thousand, while the multitude of the other saints is innumerable. For let us consider what he means when discoursing of the rest. \"I beheld a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues.\"[fn-48-P4897_1475910:23-nf] It is plain, therefore, as I said, that in the case of the other saints he introduces an unspeakable multitude, while in the case of those who are in a state of virginity he mentions only a very small number, so as to make a strong contrast with those who make up the innumerable number.[fn-48-P4898_1476216:24-nf] ","index":"20","references":[{"fn":"48","code":"P4895_1475104","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Rev. xiv. 1-4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"revelation","chapter":14,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"48","code":"P4896_1475432","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Rev. xiv. 4, 5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"revelation","chapter":14,"verses":[4]}]},{"fn":"48","code":"P4897_1475910","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Rev. vii. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"revelation","chapter":7,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"48","code":"P4898_1476216","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Compare Cyprian, vol. v. p. 475, this series.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"This, O Arete, is my discourse to you on the subject of virginity.
