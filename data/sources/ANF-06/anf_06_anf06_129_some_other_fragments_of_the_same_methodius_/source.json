One might say, that perfect and absolute piety-a thing plainly divine, and of God alone given to man, is in this place called wisdom. But the sense of the words is as follows: God, he says, hath given great things unto men, sowing, as it were, in their nature the power of discovery, together with wisdom, and the faculty of art. And men having received this, dig metals out of the earth, and cultivate it; but that wisdom which is conjoined with piety, it is not possible in any place to discover. Man cannot obtain it from his own resources, nor can he give it unto others. Hence it was that the wise men of the Greeks, who in their own strength sought to search out piety, and the worship of the Deity, did not attain their end. For it is a thing, as we have said, which exceeds human strength, the gift and the grace of God; and therefore from the beginning, partly by visions, partly by the intervention of angels, partly by the discourses of the divinely-inspired prophets, God instructed man in the principles of true religion. Nay, moreover, that contemplative wisdom by which we are impelled to the arts, and to other pursuits, and with which we are all in common, just and unjust, alike endued, is the gift of God: if we have been made rational creatures, we have received this. Wherefore, also, in a former place it was said, as of a thing that is of God bestowed, \"Is it not the Lord who teacheth understanding and knowledge? \"[fn-62-P6255_1925105:2-nf] ","index":"17","references":[{"fn":"62","code":"P6255_1925105","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Job xxi. 22, xxii. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"job","chapter":21,"verses":[22]}]}]},{"text":"\nII.[fn-62-P6258_1925134:3-nf] ","index":"18","references":[{"fn":"62","code":"P6258_1925134","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Ex Nicetae Catena on Job, cap. xxvi. p. 538.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"Observe that the Lord was not wont from the beginning to speak with man; but after that the soul was prepared, and exercised in many ways, and had ascended into the height by contemplation, so far as it is possible for human nature to ascend, then is it His wont to speak, and to reveal His Word unto those who have attained unto this elevation. But since the whirlwind is the producer of the tempests, and Job, in the tempest of his afflictions, had not made shipwreck of his faith, but his constancy shone forth the rather; therefore it was that He who gave him an answer answered him by the whirlwind, to signify the tempest of calamity which had befallen him; but, because He changed the stormy condition of his affairs into one of serene tranquillity, He spoke to him not only by the whirlwind, but in clouds also.","index":"19","references":[]},{"text":"\nIII.[fn-62-P6262_1926006:4-nf] ","index":"20","references":[{"fn":"62","code":"P6262_1926006","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Ex Nicetae Catena on Job, p. 547.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"Many have descended into the deep, not so as to walk on it, but so as to be by its bonds restrained.
