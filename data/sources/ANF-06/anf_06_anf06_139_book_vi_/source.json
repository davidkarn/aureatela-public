For it belongs to a mortal race and human weakness to act otherwise;[fn-80-P8060_2538349:10-nf] and the maxims and declarations of wise men state distinctly, that those who are touched by passion live a life of suffering,[fn-80-P8061_2538810:11-nf] and are weakened by grief,[fn-80-P8062_2538880:12-nf] and that it cannot be but that those who have been given over to disquieting feelings, have been bound by the laws of mortality.

But, we are told, we rear no temples to them, and do not worship their images; we do not slay victims in sacrifice, we do not offer incense[fn-80-P8064_2539558:13-nf] and libations of wine. And what greater honour or dignity can we ascribe to them, than that we put them in the same position as the Head and Lord of the universe, to whom the gods owe it in common with us,[fn-80-P8065_2539801:14-nf] that they are conscious that they exist, and have a living being?[fn-80-P8066_2540070:15-nf] For do we honour Him with shrines, and by building temples?[fn-80-P8067_2540177:16-nf] Do we even slay victims to Him? Do we give Him the other things, to take which and pour them forth in libation shows not a careful regard to reason, but heed to a practice maintained[fn-80-P8068_2541025:17-nf] merely by usage? For it is perfect folly to measure greater powers by your necessities, and to give the things useful to yourself to the gods who give all things, and to think this an honour, not an insult. We ask, therefore, to do what service to the gods, or to meet what want, do you say that temples have been reared,[fn-80-P8069_2541371:18-nf] and think that they should be again built? Do they feel the cold of[fn-80-P8070_2541518:19-nf] winter, or are they scorched by summer suns? Do storms of rain flow over them, or whirlwinds shake them? Are they in danger of being exposed to the onset of enemies, or the furious attacks of wild beasts, so that it is right and becoming to shut them up in places of security,[fn-80-P8071_2541900:20-nf] or guard them by throwing up a rampart of stones? For what are these temples?

Though these, then, should be built of heaps of marble, or shine resplendent with ceilings fretted with gold, though precious stones sparkle here, and gleam like stars set at varying intervals, all these things are made up of earth, and of the lowest dregs of even baser matter. For not even, if you value these more highly, is it to be believed that the gods take pleasure in them, or that they do not refuse and scorn to shut themselves up, and be confined within these barriers. This, my opponent says, is the temple of Mars, this that of Juno and of Venus, this that of Hercules, of Apollo, of Dis. What is this but to say this is the house of Mars, this of Juno and Venus,[fn-80-P8077_2543654:26-nf] Apollo dwells here, in this abides Hercules, in that Summanus?

But, says my opponent, it is not for this reason that we assign temples to the gods as though we wished to ward off from them drenching storms of rain, winds, showers, or the rays of the sun; but in order that we may be able to see them in person and close at hand, to come near and address them, and impart to them, when in a measure present, the expressions of our reverent feelings. For if they are invoked under the open heaven, and the canopy of ether, they hear nothing, I suppose; and unless prayers are addressed to them near at hand, they will stand deaf and immoveable as if nothing were said. And yet we think that every god whatever-if only he has the power of this name-should hear what every one said from every part of the world, just as if he were present; nay, more, should foresee, without waiting to be told[fn-80-P8082_2545130:30-nf] what every one conceived in his secret and silent[fn-80-P8083_2545222:31-nf] thoughts.

For this it is that belongs specially to the gods,-to fill all things with their power, to be not partly at any place, but all everywhere, not to go to dine with the Aethiopians, and return after twelve days to their own dwellings.[fn-80-P8085_2546131:33-nf] ","index":"6","references":[{"fn":"80","code":"P8082_2545130","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Lit., \"knowledge being anticipated.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"80","code":"P8083_2545222","folder":"ANF-06","text":"These words, et tacitis, omitted by Oberth√ºr, are similarly omitted by Orelli without remark.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"80","code":"P8084_2545502","folder":"ANF-06","text":"So the edd., inserting quo- into the ms. reading ita-que-\"it is therefore fitting,\" which is absurd, as making the connection between the members of the sentence one not of analogy, but of logical sequence.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"80","code":"P8085_2546131","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Cf. the speech of Thetis, Iliad, i. 423-425.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"5.

For, to make it clear,[fn-80-P8088_2546564:35-nf] let us suppose that there is a temple of some deity in the Canary Islands, another of the same deity in remotest Thyle, also among the Seres, among the tawny Garamantes, and any others[fn-80-P8089_2546807:36-nf] who are debarred from knowing each other by seas, mountains, forests, and the four quarters of the world.

For either he will be nowhere present, if he may at times not be anywhere,[fn-80-P8091_2547618:38-nf] or he will be at one place only, since he cannot give his attention generally, and without making any distinction.

What can you say as to this, that it is attested by the writings of authors, that many of these temples which have been raised with golden domes and lofty roofs cover bones and ashes, and are sepulchres of the dead?

Antiochus,[fn-80-P8093_2548641:39-nf] in the ninth book of his Histories, relates that Cecrops was buried in the temple of Minerva,[fn-80-P8094_2548925:40-nf] at Athens; again, in the temple of the same goddess, which is in the citadel of Larissa,[fn-80-P8095_2549040:41-nf] it is related and declared that Acrisius was laid, and in the sanctuary of Polias,[fn-80-P8096_2549277:42-nf] Erichthonius; while the brothers Dairas and Immarnachus were buried in the enclosure of Eleusin, which lies near the city. What say you as to the virgin daughters of Coleus? are they not said to be buried[fn-80-P8097_2549678:43-nf] in the temple of Ceres at Eleusin? and in the shrine of Diana, which was set up in the temple of the Delian Apollo, are not Hyperoche and Laodice buried, who are said to have been brought thither from the country of the Hyperboreans? In the Milesian Didymae,[fn-80-P8098_2550073:44-nf] Leandrius says that Cleochus had the last honours of burial paid to him. Zeno of Myndus openly relates that the monument of Leucophryne is in the sanctuary of Diana at Maghesia.
