Nobody can assure us that the sufferings of one may not be in some way necessary to the good of the many. A tax may thus be laid upon innocence in behalf of the guilty, and a voluntary sacrifice may be accepted from the Innocent (the Holy One) for the payment of the debts of others. In spite of something illogical which seems to cling to this idea, the Get of its universal adoption in all ages among men must be accounted for,-the fact that all nations have always accepted this principle of expiatory sacrifice, innocent men and innocent beasts suffering for the unjust. Never could this principle have been thus universalized by human wisdom, for it seems to contradict reason; nor by human stupidity, for ignorance never could have proposed such a paradox; nor could priestcraft and kingcraft have obtained for it, among divers races and forms of society, with barbarians and philosophers, freemen and slaves, alike, a common acceptance. It must therefore proceed (1) from a natural instinct of humanity, or (2) from a divine revelation: both alike must be recognised as the work of our Creator¬∑ Now, Christianity unveils the secret, presenting the Son of God, made man, a voluntary sacrifice for the sins of the whole world¬∑ If it be a mystery, still we do not wonder at the idea when we see one man paying the debts of another, and so ransoming the debtor.[fn-86-P8684_2752093:21-nf] Christianity states this as God's plan for the ransom of sinners¬∑ Such is the fact: as to the why, it says nothing.[fn-86-P8685_2752398:22-nf] As to the philosophy of these mysteries, we reason in vain; and, happily, the Gospel does not require us to reason¬∑ The Nicene Creed formulates the truth: \"For us men and for our salvation He came down,\" etc. But we are called to profess no more than \"I believe; help Thou mine unbelief.\"","index":"40","references":[{"fn":"86","code":"P8684_2752093","folder":"ANF-06","text":"De Maistre quotes, \"Potest unus ita pro alio poenam compensare vel debitum solvere ut ille satisfacere merito dici possit.\" Bellarmin, Opp., tom. iii. col. 1493, ed.
