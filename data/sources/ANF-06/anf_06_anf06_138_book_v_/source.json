Admitting that all these things which do the immortal gods dishonour, have been put forth by poets merely in sport, what of those found in grave, serious, and careful histories, and handed down by you in hidden mysteries? have they been invented by the licentious fancy of the poets? Now if they seemed[fn-77-P7708_2432139:1-nf] to you stories of such absurdity, some of them you would neither retain in their constant use, nor celebrate as solemn festivals from year to year, nor would you maintain them among your sacred rites as shadows of real events. With strict moderation, I shall adduce only one of these stories which are so numerous; that in which Jupiter himself is brought on the stage as stupid and inconsiderate, being tricked by the ambiguity of words.

But, that this might be done more speedily, the king filled many[fn-77-P7713_2433599:5-nf] cups with wine and with mead,[fn-77-P7714_2433818:6-nf] and placed them about the approaches to the fountain, where they would be seen-a crafty snare for those who should come. They, as was their usual custom, when overcome by thirst, came to their well-known haunts. But when they had perceived cups with sweetly smelling liquors, they preferred the new to the old; rushed eagerly upon them; charmed with the sweetness of the draught, drank too much; and becoming drunk, fell fast asleep. Then the twelve youths threw themselves upon the sleepers, and cast chains round them, lying soaked with wine; and they,[fn-77-P7715_2434390:7-nf] when roused, immediately taught the king by what methods and sacrifices Jupiter could be called down to earth. With this knowledge the king performed the sacred ceremony on the Aventine, drew down Jupiter to the earth, and asked from him the due Form of expiation.

What the mind should take up first, what last, or what it should pass by silently, it is not easy to say, nor is it made clear by any amount of reflection; for all have been so devised and fitted to be laughed at, that you should strive that they may be believed to be false-even if they are true-rather than pass current as true, and suggest as it were something extraordinary, and bring contempt upon deity itself. What, then, do you say, O you-? Are we to believe[fn-77-P7723_2436326:14-nf] that that Faunus and Martius Picus-if they are of the number of the gods, and of that everlasting and immortal substance-were once parched with thirst, and sought the gushing fountains, that they might be able to cool with water their heated veins? Are we to believe that, ensnared by wine, and beguiled by the sweetness of mead, they dipped so long into the treacherous cups, that they even got into danger of becoming drunk? Are we to believe that, being fast asleep, and plunged in the forgetfulness of most profound slumbers, they gave to creatures of earth an opportunity to bind them? On what parts, then, were those bonds and chains flung? Did they have any solid substance, or had their hands been formed of hard bones, so that it might be possible to bind them with halters and hold them fast by tightly drawn knots? For I do not ask, I do not inquire whether they could have said anything when swaying to and fro in their drunken maunderings; or whether, while Jupiter was unwilling, or rather unwitting, any one could have marie known the way to bring him down to earth. This only do I wish to hear, why, if Faunus and Picus are of divine origin and power, they did not rather themselves declare to Numa, as he questioned them, that which he desired to learn from Jove himself at a greater risk? Or[fn-77-P7724_2437735:15-nf] did Jupiter alone have knowledge of this-for from him the thunderbolts fall-how training in some kind of knowledge should avert impending dangers? Or, while he himself hurls these fiery bolts, is it the business of others to know in what way it is fitting to allay his wrath and indignation? For truly it would be most absurd to suppose that he himself appoints[fn-77-P7725_2438171:16-nf] the means by which may be averted that which he has determined should befall men through the hurling of his thunderbolts. For this is to say, By such ceremonies you will turn aside my wrath; and if I shall at any time have foreshown by flashes of lightning that some evil is close at hand, do this and that, so that[fn-77-P7726_2438703:17-nf] what I have determined should be done may be done altogether in vain, and may pass away idly through the force[fn-77-P7727_2438837:18-nf] of these rites.","index":"5","references":[{"fn":"77","code":"P7723_2436326","folder":"ANF-06","text":"The ms. and edd. read cred-i-musne-\"do we believe,\" for which Meursius suggests -e- as above.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"77","code":"P7724_2437735","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Lit., \"or whether.\" Below the ms. reads corruptly ad ipsum-\"to him.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"77","code":"P7725_2438171","folder":"ANF-06","text":"The ms. reads scire, but \"knows\" would hardly suit the context.

And what, I ask, was the charm which forced Jupiter to leave the all-important[fn-77-P7729_2439311:19-nf] direction of the universe, and appear at the bidding of mortals? the sacrificial meal, incense, blood, the scent of burning laurel-boughs,[fn-77-P7730_2439473:20-nf] and muttering of spells?

You shall make expiation, he says, with a head when thunderbolts have fallen. The phrase is still incomplete, and the meaning is not fully expressed and defined; for it was necessarily right to know whether Diespiter ordains that this expiation be effected with the head of a wether, a sow, an ox, or any other animal. Now, as he had not yet fixed this specifically, and his decision was still uncertain and not yet determined, how could Numa know that Jupiter would say the head of a man, so as to[fn-77-P7731_2440529:21-nf] anticipate and prevent him, and turn his uncertain and ambiguous words[fn-77-P7732_2440623:22-nf] into \"an onion's head? \"","index":"6","references":[{"fn":"77","code":"P7729_2439311","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Lit., \"so great.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"77","code":"P7730_2439473","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Lit., \"the fumigation of verbenae,\" i.e., of boughs of the laurel, olive, or myrtle.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"77","code":"P7731_2440529","folder":"ANF-06","text":"The ms. omits ut.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"77","code":"P7732_2440623","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Lit., \"the uncertain things of that ambiguity.\"","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"4.

Is it not, then, clear and manifest that these are puerile and fanciful inventions, by which, while a lively wit is assigned[fn-77-P7736_2441185:25-nf] to Numa, the greatest want of foresight is imputed to Jupiter? For what shows so little foresight as to confess that you have been ensnared by the subtlety of a man's intellect, and while you are vexed at being deceived, to give way to the wishes of him who has overcome you, and to lay aside the means which you had proposed?

And both parts are made to contradict themselves: so that, on the one hand, Numa is shown not to have wished to know what he did wish; and, on the other, Jupiter is shown to have been merciless, because he said that he wished expiation to be made with the heads of men, which could have been done by Numa with an onion's head.","index":"7","references":[{"fn":"77","code":"P7734_2440832","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Lit., \"unless a mortal anticipated\"-praesumeret, the ms. reading.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"77","code":"P7735_2440921","folder":"ANF-06","text":"So Oehler, supplying quem.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"77","code":"P7736_2441185","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Lit., \"liveliness of heart is procured.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"77","code":"P7737_2441612","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Lit., \"why.\"","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"5.

For what is there asserted in it, or what written about the gods, which, if said with regard to a man brought up with bad habits and a pretty rough training, would not make you liable to be accused of wronging and insulting him, and expose you to hatred and dislike, accompanied by implacable resentment? From the stones, you say, which Deucalion and Pyrrha threw, was produced the mother of the gods. What do you say, O theologians? what, ye priests of the heavenly powers? Did the mother of the gods, then, not exist at all for the sake of the deluge? and would there be no cause or beginning of her birth, had not violent storms of rain swept away the whole race of men? It is through man, then, that she feels herself to exist, and she owes it to Pyrrha's kindness that she sees herself addressed as a real being;[fn-77-P7775_2453924:60-nf] but if that is indeed true, this too will of necessity not be false, that she was human, not divine. For if it is certain that men are sprung originally from the casting of stones, it must be believed that she too was one of us, since she was produced by means of the same causes. For it cannot be, for nature would not suffer it,[fn-77-P7776_2454468:61-nf] that from one kind of stones, and from the same mode of throwing them, some should be formed to rank among the immortals, others with the condition of men. Varro, that famous Roman, distinguished by the diversity of his learning, and unwearied in his researches into ancient times, in the first of four books which he has left in writing on the race of the Roman people, shows by careful calculations, that from the time of the deluge, which we mentioned before, down to the consulship of Hirtius and Pansa,[fn-77-P7777_2455023:62-nf] there are not quite two thousand years; and if he is to be believed, the Great Mother, too, must be said to have her whole life bounded by the limits of this number. And thus the matter is brought to this issue, that she who is said to be parent of all the deities is not their mother, but their daughter; nay, rather a mere child, a little girl, since we admit that in the never-ending series of ages neither beginning nor end has been ascribed to the gods.","index":"11","references":[{"fn":"77","code":"P7773_2452943","folder":"ANF-06","text":"i.e., in the ever-recurring festival of Cybele.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"77","code":"P7774_2453038","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Lit., \"length.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"77","code":"P7775_2453924","folder":"ANF-06","text":"So the edd., reading orari in alicujus substantiae qualitate for the ms. erari restored by Oehler, num-erari-\"numbered in the quality of some substance,\" from the reading of an old copy adopted by Livineius.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"77","code":"P7776_2454468","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Lit., \"through the resistance of nature.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"77","code":"P7777_2455023","folder":"ANF-06","text":"B.C. 43.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"9.

But now, indeed, when the restraining of vices is said to be signified by the binding of Mars and Venus, two most inconsistent[fn-80-P8020_2528823:263-nf] things are done at the very same time; so that, on the one hand, a description of something vile suggests an honourable meaning, and on the other, the baseness occupies the mind before any regard for religion can do so.","index":"53","references":[{"fn":"80","code":"P8011_2526419","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Passivè.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"80","code":"P8012_2526606","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Lit., \"strong in chastity.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"80","code":"P8013_2526652","folder":"ANF-06","text":"The ms., first three edd., Elm., and Oehler read commorantur-\"lingers,\" i.e., \"continues to be spoken of;\"the other edd. receive commemorantur, as above, from the errata in the 1st ed.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"80","code":"P8014_2526888","folder":"ANF-06","text":"The ms., first four edd., and Oehler read gravitas-seriousness; corrected pr. as above, in all edd. after Stewechius.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"80","code":"P8015_2527117","folder":"ANF-06","text":"So, perhaps, the unintelligible ms. dignorum should be emended digna rerum.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"80","code":"P8016_2527556","folder":"ANF-06","text":"So all edd. since Stewechius, adding s to the ms. voluisse.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"80","code":"P8017_2527915","folder":"ANF-06","text":"i.e., the mere fact that the stories were published, showed a wish to teach; but their being allegories, showed a reluctance to allow them to be understood.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"80","code":"P8018_2528246","folder":"ANF-06","text":"The edd. read this sentence interrogatively.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"80","code":"P8019_2528333","folder":"ANF-06","text":"i.e., \"if you said exactly what you mean.\" The reference is not to the immediately preceding words, but to the question on which the chapter is based-\"what prevented you from expressing,\" etc.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"80","code":"P8020_2528823","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Lit., \"perverse.\"","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"42.

Lastly, and finally, what do the gods mean, that while they do not wish honourable, they allow unseemly, even the basest things, to be said about them?
