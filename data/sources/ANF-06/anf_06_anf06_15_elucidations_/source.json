The two apostles had each his jurisdiction, and they kept to their own \"line of things\" respectively. How, then, came St. Peter to visit Rome? The answer is clear: unless he came involuntarily, as a prisoner, he came to look after the Church of the Circumcision,[fn-8-P870_239939:102-nf] which was \"in his measure; \"and doubtless St. Paul urged him to this, the Hebrew Christians there being so large a proportion of the Church. St. Peter came \"at the close of his life,\" doubtless attended by an apostolic companion, as St. Paul was, and Barnabas also (Acts xv. 39, 40). Linus probably laboured for St. Paul (in prison) among the Gentile Romans,[fn-8-P871_240360:103-nf] and Cletus for St. Peter among Jewish Christians. St. Peter survived all his martyred associates, and left Clement in charge of the whole Church. This most probable theory squares with all known facts, and reconciles all difficulties.
