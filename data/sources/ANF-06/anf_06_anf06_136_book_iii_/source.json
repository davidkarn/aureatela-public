But if the gods bear these things which are seen, it is fitting that they should bear those also which the skin conceals under the framework of the ribs, and the membranes enclosing the viscera; windpipes, stomachs, spleens, lungs, bladders, livers, the long-entwined intestines, and the veins of purple blood, joined with the air-passages,[fn-73-P7316_2301802:48-nf] coursing through the whole viscera.","index":"16","references":[{"fn":"73","code":"P7314_2300640","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Cf.

Further, if this is the case, you must see whether the gods are all alike, or are marked by a difference in the contour of their forms.

We should therefore say that some have big heads, prominent brows, broad brows, thick lips; that others of them have long chins, moles, and high noses; that these have dilated nostrils, those are snub-nosed; some chubby from a swelling of their jaws or growth of their cheeks, dwarfed, tall, of middle size, lean, sleek, fat; some with crisped and curled hair, others shaven, with bald and smooth heads.

We might, however, even yet be able to receive from you these thoughts, most full of wicked falsehoods, if it were not that you yourselves, in bringing forward many things about the gods so inconsistent and mutually destructive, compel us to withhold our minds from assenting. For when you strive individually to excel each other in reputation for more recondite knowledge, you both overthrow the very gods in whom you believe, and replace them by others who have clearly no existence; and different men give different opinions on the same subjects,[fn-73-P7366_2325467:82-nf] and you write that those whom general consent has ever received as single persons are infinite in number. Let us, too, begin duty, then, with father Janus, whom certain of you have declared to be the world, others the year, some the sun. But if we are to believe that this is true, it follows as a consequence, that it should be understood that there never was any Janus, who, they say, being sprung from Coelus and Hecate, reigned first in Italy, founded the town Janiculum, was the father of Forts,[fn-73-P7367_2326091:83-nf] the son-in-law of Vulturnus, the husband of Juturna; and thus you erase the name of the god to whom in all prayers you give the first place, and whom you believe to procure for you a hearing from the gods. But, again, if Janus be the year, neither thus can he be a god. For who does not know that the year is a fixed space[fn-73-P7368_2326481:84-nf] of time, and that there is nothing divine in that which is formed[fn-73-P7369_2326569:85-nf] by the duration of months and lapse of days?

Nigidius taught that the dii Penates were Neptune and Apollo, who once, on fixed terms, girt Ilium[fn-74-P7432_2342783:136-nf] with walls. He himself again, in his sixteenth book, following Etruscan teaching, shows that there are four kinds of Penates; and that one of these pertains to Jupiter, another to Neptune, the third to the shades below, the fourth to mortal men, making some unintelligible assertion. Caesius himself, also, following this teaching, thinks that they are Fortune, and Ceres, the genius Jovialis,[fn-74-P7433_2343246:137-nf] and Pales, but not the female deity commonly received,[fn-74-P7434_2343459:138-nf] but some male attendant and steward of Jupiter. Varro thinks that they are the gods of whom we speak who are within, and in the inmost recesses of heaven, and that neither their number nor names are known. The Etruscans say that these are the Consentes and Complices,[fn-74-P7435_2343772:139-nf] and name them because they rise and fall together, six of them being male, and as many female, with unknown names and pitiless dispositions,[fn-74-P7436_2344856:140-nf] but they are considered the counsellors and princes of Jove supreme. There were some, too, who said that Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva were the dii Penates, without whom we cannot live and be wise, and by whom we are ruled within in reason, passion, and thought. As you see, even here, too, nothing is said harmoniously, nothing is settled with the consent of all, nor is there anything reliable on which the mind can take its stand, drawing by conjecture very near to the truth. For their opinions are so doubtful, and one supposition so discredited[fn-74-P7437_2345667:141-nf] by another, that there is either no truth in them all, or if it is uttered by any, it is not recognised amid so many different statements.","index":"44","references":[{"fn":"74","code":"P7432_2342783","folder":"ANF-06","text":"The ms. reads immortalium, corrected in the edd. urbem Ilium.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"74","code":"P7433_2343246","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Supposed to be either the genius attending Jupiter; the family god as sent by him; or the chief among the genii, sometimes mentioned simply as Genius.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"74","code":"P7434_2343459","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Lit., \"whom the commonalty receives.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"74","code":"P7435_2343772","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Consentes (those who are together, or agree together, i. e, councillors) and Complices (confederate, or agreeing) are said by some to be the twelve gods who composed the great council of heaven; and, in accordance with this, the words una oriantur et occidant una might be translated \"rise and sit down together,\" i.e., at the council table.
