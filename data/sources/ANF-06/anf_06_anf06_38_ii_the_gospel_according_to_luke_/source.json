This word, however, \"Let the cup pass,\" does not mean, Let it not come near me, or approach me.[fn-19-P1981_566212:2-nf] For what can \"pass from Him,\" certainly must first come nigh Him; and what does pass thus from Him, must be by Him. For if it does not reach Him, it cannot pass from Him. For He takes to Himself the person of man, as having been made man. Wherefore also on this occasion He deprecates the doing of the inferior, which is His own, and begs that the superior should be done, which is His Father's, to wit, the divine will; which again, however, in respect of the divinity, is one and the same will in Himself and in the Father. For it was the Father's will that He should pass through every trial (temptation); and the Father Himself in a marvellous manner brought Him on this course, not indeed with the trial itself as His goal, nor in order simply that He might enter into that, but in order that He might prove Himself to be above the trial, and also beyond it.[fn-19-P1982_567147:3-nf] And surely it is the fact, that the Saviour asks neither what is impossible, nor what is impracticable, nor what is contrary to the will of the Father. It is something possible; for I Mark makes mention of His saying, \"Abba, Father, all things are possible unto Thee.\"[fn-19-P1983_567481:4-nf] And they are possible if He wills them; for Luke tells us that He said, \"Father, if Thou be willing, remove[fn-19-P1984_567606:5-nf] this cup from me.\" The Holy Spirit, therefore, apportioned among the evangelists, makes up the full account of our Saviour's whole disposition by the expressions of these several narrators together. He does not, then, ask of the Father what the Father wills not. For the words, \"If Thou be willing,\" were demonstrative of subjection and docility,[fn-19-P1985_567967:6-nf] not of ignorance or hesitancy. For this reason, the other scripture says, \"All things are possible unto Thee.\" And Matthew again admirably describes the submission and humility[fn-19-P1986_568161:7-nf] when he says, \"If it be possible.\" For unless I adapt the sense in this way,[fn-19-P1987_568412:8-nf] some will perhaps assign an impious signification to this expression, \"If it be possible; \"as if there were anything impossible for God to do, except that only which He does not will to do. But ... being straightway strengthened in His humanity by His ancestral[fn-19-P1988_568701:9-nf] divinity, he urges the safer petition, and desires no longer that should be the case, but that it might be accomplished in accordance with the Father's good pleasure, in glory, in constancy, and in fulness. For John, who has given us the record of the sublimest and divinest of the Saviour's words and deeds, heard Him speak thus: \"And the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it? \"[fn-19-P1989_569115:10-nf] Now, to drink the cup was to discharge the ministry and the whole economy of trial with fortitude, to follow and fulfil the Father's determination, and to surmount all apprehensions. And the exclamation, \"Why hast Thou forsaken me? \"was in due accordance with the requests He had previously made: Why is it that death has been in conjunction with me all along up till now, and that I bear not yet the cup? This I judge to have been the Saviour's meaning in this concise utterance.","index":"6","references":[{"fn":"19","code":"P1981_566212","folder":"ANF-06","text":"ou0k e@sti.

For such is the force of the expression, \"as it were great drops.\" But rather with the object of making it plain that the Lord's body was not bedewed with any kind of subtle moisture which had only the show and appearance of actuality, but that it was really suffused all over with sweat in the shape of large thick drops, he has taken the great drops of blood as an illustration of what was the case with Him. And accordingly, as by the intensity of the supplication and the severe agony, so also by the dense and excessive sweat, he made the facts patent, that the Saviour was man by nature and in reality, and not in mere semblance and appearance, and that He was subject to all the innocent sensibilities natural to men.
