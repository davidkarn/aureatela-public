No one, therefore, can know God unless he apprehends the Son; for the Son is the wisdom by whose instrumentality all things have been created; and these created objects declare this wisdom, and God is recognised in the wisdom. But the wisdom of God is not anything similar to the wisdom which man possesses, but it is the perfect wisdom which proceeds from the perfect God, and abides for ever, not like the thought of man, which passes from him in the word that is spoken and (straightway) ceases to be. Wherefore it is not wisdom only, but also God; nor is it Word only, but also Son. And whether, then, one discerns God through creation, or is taught to know Him by the Holy Scriptures, it is impossible either to apprehend Him or to learn of Him apart from His wisdom. And he who calls upon God rightly, calls on Him through the Son; and he who approaches Him in a true fellowship, comes to Him through Christ. Moreover, the Son Himself cannot be approached apart from the Spirit. For the Spirit is both the life and the holy formation of all things;[fn-7-P706_208404:8-nf] and God sending forth this Spirit through the Son makes the creature[fn-7-P707_208497:9-nf] like Himself.","index":"32","references":[{"fn":"7","code":"P704_207073","folder":"ANF-06","text":"prokopa/j.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"7","code":"P705_207135","folder":"ANF-06","text":"do/can th\\n e0piginome/nhn.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"7","code":"P706_208404","folder":"ANF-06","text":"morfwsij tw=n o#lwn.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"7","code":"P707_208497","folder":"ANF-06","text":"th\\n ktisin.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"\nIV.","index":"33","references":[]},{"text":"One therefore is God the Father, one the Word, one the Spirit, the life, the sanctification of all.

Further, although the saints are called both gods, and sons, and spirits, they are neither filled with the Spirit, nor are made like the Son and God. And if, then, any one makes this affirmation, that the Son is God, simply as being Himself filled with divinity, and not as being generated of divinity, he has belied the Word, he has belied the Wisdom, he has lost the knowledge of God; he has fallen away into the worship of the creature, he has taken up the impiety of the Greeks, to that he has gone back; and he has become a follower of the unbelief of the Jews, who, supposing the Word of God to be but a human son, have refused to accept Him as God, and have declined to acknowledge Him as the Son of God. But it is impious to think of the Word of God as merely human, and to think of the works which are done by Him as abiding, while He abides not Himself.

That man, consequently, belies the fountain of sanctification, the Holy Spirit, who denudes Him of the power of sanctifying, and he will thus be precluded from numbering Him with the Father and the Son; he makes nought, too, of the holy (ordinance of) baptism, and will no more be able to acknowledge the holy and august Trinity.[fn-7-P718_210841:14-nf] For either we must apprehend the perfect Trinity[fn-7-P719_210925:15-nf] in its natural and genuine glory, or we shall be under the necessity of speaking no more of a Trinity, but only of a Unity;[fn-7-P720_211084:16-nf] or else, not numbering[fn-7-P721_211119:17-nf] created objects with the Creator, nor the creatures with the Lord of all, we mast also not number what is sanctified with what sanctifies; even as no object that is made can be numbered with the Trinity, but in the name of the Holy Trinity baptism and invocation and worship are administered. For if there are three several glories, there must also be three several forms of cultus with those who impiously worship the creature; for if there is a distinction in the nature of the objects worshipped, there ought to be also with these men a distinction in the nature of the worship offered. What is recent[fn-7-P722_211743:18-nf] surely is not to be worshipped along with what is eternal; for the recent comprehends all that has had a beginning, while mighty and measureless is lie who is before the ages.

Nevertheless it bears that we should not speak of two persons in Christ, lest, by thus acknowledging Him as God, and as in the perfect divinity, and yet speaking of two persons, we should make a Tetrad of the divine persons, counting that of God the Father as one, and that of the Son of God as one, and that of the man as one, and that of the Holy Spirit as one. But, again, it bears also against recognising two divine natures,[fn-8-P860_238956:99-nf] and rather for acknowledging Him to be perfect God in one natural divine perfection, and not in two; for his object is to show that He became incarnate without change, and that He retains the divinity without duplication.[fn-8-P861_239193:100-nf] Accordingly he says shortly: \"And while the affections of the flesh spring, the energy[fn-8-P862_239304:101-nf] retains the impassibility proper to it. He, therefore, who introduces the (idea of) passion into the energy is impious; for it was the Lord of glory that appeared in human form, having taken to Himself the human economy.\"","index":"74","references":[{"fn":"8","code":"P859_238090","folder":"ANF-06","text":"fu/seij.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"8","code":"P860_238956","folder":"ANF-06","text":"fu/seij.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"8","code":"P861_239193","folder":"ANF-06","text":"a0diplasia/stwj.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"8","code":"P862_239304","folder":"ANF-06","text":"du/namij.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"","index":"75","references":[]},{"text":"","index":"76","references":[]}]}]}
