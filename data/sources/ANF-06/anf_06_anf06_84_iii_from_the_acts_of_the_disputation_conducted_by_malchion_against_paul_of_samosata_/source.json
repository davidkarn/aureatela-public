You, however, appear to me to decline to admit a constitution[fn-31-P3177_813185:3-nf] after this fashion: to the effect that there is not in this person, the Son of God according to substance, but only the Wisdom according to participation. For you made this assertion, that the Wisdom bears dispensing, and therefore cannot be compounded;[fn-31-P3178_813479:4-nf] and you do not consider that the divine Wisdom remained undiminished, even as it was before it evacuated itself;[fn-31-P3179_813610:5-nf] and thus in this self-evacuation, which it took upon itself in compassion (for us), it continued undiminished and unchangeable.
