I exhorted them to make an investigation into that dogma in public. Accordingly, when they had brought this book before us, as though it were a kind of weapon or impregnable battlement, I sat with them for three days in succession from morning till evening, and attempted to set them right on the subjects propounded in the composition. Then, too, I was greatly gratified by observing the constancy of the brethren, and their love of the truth, and their docility and intelligence, as we proceeded, in an orderly method, and in a spirit of moderation, to deal with questions, and difficulties, and concessions. For we took care not to press, in every way and with jealous urgency, opinions which had once been adopted, even although they might appear to be correct.[fn-13-P1364_370279:8-nf] Neither did we evade objections alleged by others; but we endeavoured as far as possible to keep by the subject in hand, and to establish the positions pertinent to it.

And at last the author and introducer of this doctrine, whose name was Coracion, in the hearing of all the brethren present, made acknowledgment of his position, and engaged to us that he would no longer hold by his opinion, nor discuss it, nor mention it, nor teach it, as he had been completely convinced by the arguments of those opposed to it.

Then, a little further on, he speaks of the Revelation of John as follows:-Now some before our time have set aside this book, and repudiated it entirely, criticising it chapter by chapter, and endeavouring to show it to be without either sense or reason. They have alleged also that its title is false; for they deny that John is the author. Nay, further, they hold that it can be no sort of revelation, because it is covered with so gross and dense a veil of ignorance. They affirm, therefore, that none of the apostles, nor indeed any of the saints, nor any person belonging to the Church, could be its author; but that Cerinthus,[fn-13-P1367_372716:10-nf] and the heretical sect founded by him, and named after him the Cerinthian sect, being desirous of attaching the authority of a great name to the fiction propounded by him, prefixed that title to the book. For the doctrine inculcated by Cerinthus is this: that there will be an earthly reign of Christ; and as he was himself a man devoted to the pleasures of the body, and altogether carnal l in his dispositions, he fancied[fn-13-P1368_373218:11-nf] that that kingdom would consist in those kinds of gratifications on which his own heart was set,-to wit, in the delights of the belly, and what comes beneath the belly, that is to say, in eating and drinking, and marrying, and in other things under the guise of which he thought he could indulge his appetites with a better grace,[fn-13-P1369_373655:12-nf] such as festivals, and sacrifices, and the slaying of victims. But I, for my part, could not venture to set this book aside, for there are many brethren who value it highly. Yet, having formed an idea of it as a composition exceeding my capacity of understanding, I regard it as containing a kind of hidden and wonderful intelligence on the several subjects which come under it. For though I cannot comprehend it, I still suspect that there is some deeper sense underlying the words. And I do not measure and judge its expressions by the standard of my own reason, but, making more allowance for faith, I have simply regarded them as too lofty for my comprehension; and I do not forthwith reject what I do not understand, but I am only the more filled with wonder at it, in that I have not been able to discern its import.[fn-13-P1370_375069:13-nf] ","index":"31","references":[{"fn":"13","code":"P1367_372716","folder":"ANF-06","text":"This passage is given substantially by Eusebius also in book iii. c. 28.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"13","code":"P1368_373218","folder":"ANF-06","text":"The text gives o0neiropolei=n, for which  for which o0neiropolei=/ or w0neiropo/l/\\ei is to be read.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"13","code":"P1369_373655","folder":"ANF-06","text":"These gross views of millennial perfection entailed upon subsequent ages a reactionary neglect of the study of the Second Advent.

What John this is, however, is uncertain.

And surely he would have given us some of these indications if it had been his purpose to make himself clearly known. But of all this he offers us nothing; and he only calls himself our brother and companion, and the witness of Jesus, and one blessed with the seeing and hearing of these revelations. I am also of opinion that there were many persons of the same name with John the apostle, who by their love for him, and their admiration and emulation of him, and their desire to be loved by the Lord as he was loved, were induced to embrace also the same designation, just as we find many of the children of the faithful called by the names of Paul and Peter.[fn-13-P1381_379683:21-nf] There is, besides, another John mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles, with the surname Mark, whom Barnabas and Paul attached to themselves as companion, and of whom again it is said: \"And they had also John to their minister.\"[fn-13-P1382_381131:22-nf] But whether this is the one who wrote the Revelation, I could not say.

And from the ideas, and the expressions, and the collocation of the same, it may be very reasonably conjectured that this one is distinct from that.[fn-13-P1385_381787:24-nf] For the Gospel and the Epistle agree with each other, and both commence in the same way. For the one opens thus, \"In the beginning was the Word; \"while the other opens thus, \"That which was from the beginning.\" The one says: \"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us; and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father.\"[fn-13-P1386_383083:25-nf] The other says the same things, with a slight alteration: \"That which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life: and the life was manifested.\"[fn-13-P1387_383325:26-nf] For these things are introduced by way of prelude, and in opposition, as he has shown in the subsequent parts, to those who deny that the Lord is come in the flesh. For which reason he has also been careful to add these words: \"And that which we have seen we testify, and show unto you that eternal life which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us: that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you.\"[fn-13-P1388_383754:27-nf] Thus he keeps to himself, and does not diverge inconsistently from his subjects, but goes through them all under the same heads and in the same phraseologies, some of which we shall briefly mention. Thus the attentive reader will find the phrases, \"the life,\" \"the light,\" occurring often in both; and also such expressions as fleeing from darkness, holding the truth, grace, joy, the flesh and the blood of the Lord, the judgment, the remission of sins, the love of God toward us, the commandment of love an our side toward each other; as also, that we ought to keep all the commandments, the conviction of the world, of the devil, of Antichrist, the promise of the Holy Spirit, the adoption of God, the faith required of us in all things, the Father and the Son, named as such everywhere. And altogether, through their whole course, it will be evident that the Gospel and the Epistle are distinguished by one and the same character of writing. But the Revelation is totally different, and altogether distinct from this; and I might almost say that it does not even come near it, or border upon it. Neither does it contain a syllable in common with these other books. Nay more, the Epistle-for I say nothing of the Gospel-does not make any mention or evince any notion of the Revelation and the Revelation, in like manner, gives no note of the Epistle.

And the allegation is, that Diodorus was the person who gave them their names as bodies indivisible into parts.[fn-14-P1400_390141:33-nf] But it is also said that Heraclides attached another name to them, and called them \"weights; \"[fn-14-P1401_390256:34-nf] and from him the physician Asclepiades also derived that name.[fn-14-P1402_390333:35-nf] ","index":"39","references":[{"fn":"13","code":"P1398_388665","folder":"ANF-06","text":"ou9si/an.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"13","code":"P1399_388797","folder":"ANF-06","text":"a0prono/hton.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1400_390141","folder":"ANF-06","text":"tw=n a0merw=n.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1401_390256","folder":"ANF-06","text":"o@gkouj.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1402_390333","folder":"ANF-06","text":"e0klhrono/mhse to\\ o@noma.

For, as it is said, \"God saw everything that He had made, and, behold, it was very good.\"[fn-14-P1406_391115:36-nf] But truly these men do not reflect on[fn-14-P1407_391170:37-nf] the analogies even of small familiar things which might come under their observation at any time, and from which they might learn that no object of any utility, and fitted to be serviceable, is made without design or by mere chance, but is wrought by skill of hand, and is contrived so as to meet its proper use. And when the object falls out of service and becomes useless, then it also begins to break up indeterminately, and to decompose and dissipate its materials in every casual and unregulated way, just as the wisdom by which it was skilfully constructed at first no longer controls and maintains it. For a cloak, for example, cannot be made without the weaver, as if the warp could be set aright and the woof could be entwined with it by their own spontaneous action; while, on the other hand, if it is once worn out, its tattered rags are flung aside. Again, when a house or a city is built, it does not take on its stones, as if some of them placed themselves spontaneously upon the foundations, and others lifted themselves up on the several layers, but the builder carefully disposes the skilfully prepared stones in their proper positions; while if the structure happens once to give way, the stones are separated and cast down and scattered about. And so, too, when a ship is built, the keel does not lay itself, neither does the mast erect itself in the centre, nor do all the other timbers take up their positions casually and by their own motion. Nor, again, do the so-called hundred beams in the wain fit themselves spontaneously to the vacant spaces they severally light on. But the carpenter in both cases puts the materials together in the right way and at the right time.[fn-14-P1408_393015:38-nf] And if the ship goes to sea and is wrecked, or if the wain drives along on land and is shattered, their timbers are broken up and cast abroad anywhere,-those of the former by the waves, and those of the latter by the violence of the impetus. In like manner, then, we might with all propriety say also to these men, that those atoms of theirs, which remain idle and unmanipulated and useless, are introduced vainly.

Or who can believe that those regular movements and courses are the products of a certain unregulated impetus? Or who can allow that the perfect concord subsisting among the celestial bodies derives its harmony from instruments destitute both of concord and harmony? Or, again, if there is but one and the same substance[fn-14-P1416_396934:43-nf] in all things, and if there is the same incorruptible nature[fn-14-P1417_397010:44-nf] in all,-the only elements of difference being, as they aver, size and figure,-how comes it that there are some bodies divine and perfect,[fn-14-P1418_397163:45-nf] and eternal,[fn-14-P1419_397192:46-nf] as they would phrase it, or lasting,[fn-14-P1420_397244:47-nf] as some one may prefer to express it; and among these some that are visible and others that are invisible,-the visible including such as sun, and moon, and stars, and earth, and water; and the invisible including gods, and demons, and spirits? For the existence of such they cannot possibly deny however desirous to do so. And again, there are other objects that are long-lived, both animals and plants. As to animals, there are, for example, among birds, as they say, the eagle, the raven, and the phoenix; and among creatures living on land, there are the stag, and the elephant, and the dragon; and among aquatic creatures there are the whales, and such like monsters of the deep. And as to trees, there are the palm, and the oak, and the persea;[fn-14-P1421_398011:48-nf] and among trees, too, there are some that are evergreens, of which kind fourteen have been reckoned up by some one; and there are others that only bloom for a certain season, and then shed their leaves. And there are other objects, again-which indeed constitute the vast mass of all which either grow or are begotten-that have an early death and a brief life. And among these is man himself, as a certain holy scripture says of him: \"Man that is born of woman is of few days.\"[fn-14-P1422_398576:49-nf] Well, but I suppose they will reply that the varying conjunctions of the atoms account fully for differences[fn-14-P1423_398702:50-nf] so great in the matter of duration. For it is maintained that there are some things that are compressed together by them, and firmly interlaced, so that they become closely compacted bodies, and consequently exceedingly hard to break up; while there are others in which more or less the conjunction of the atoms is of a looser and weaker nature, so that either quickly or after some time they separate themselves from their orderly constitution. And, again, there are some bodies made up of atoms of a definite kind and a certain common figure, while there are others made up of diverse atoms diversely disposed. But who, then, is the sagacious discriminator,[fn-14-P1424_399430:51-nf] that brings certain atoms into collocation, and separates others; and marshals some in such wise as to form the sun, and others in such a way as to originate the moon, and adapts all in natural fitness, and in accordance with the proper constitution of each star? For surely neither would those solar atoms, with their peculiar size and kind, and with their special mode of collocation, ever have reduced themselves so as to effect the production of a moon; nor, on the other hand, would the conjunctions of these lunar atoms ever have developed into a sun. And as certainly neither would Arcturus, resplendent as he is, ever boast his having the atoms possessed by Lucifer, nor would the Pleiades glory in being constituted of those of Orion. For well has Paul expressed the distinction when he says: \"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.\"[fn-14-P1425_400397:52-nf] And if the coalition effected among them has been an unintelligent one, as is the case with soulless[fn-14-P1426_400518:53-nf] objects, then they must needs have had some sagacious artificer; and if their union has been one without the determination of will, and only of necessity, as is the case with irrational objects, then some skilful leader[fn-14-P1427_400754:54-nf] must have brought them together and taken them under his charge. And if they have linked themselves together spontaneously, for a spontaneous work, then some admirable architect must have apportioned their work for them, and assumed the superintendence among them; or there must have been one to do with them as the general does who loves order and discipline, and who does not leave his army in an irregular condition, or suffer all things to go on confusedly, but marshals the cavalry in their proper succession, and disposes the heavy-armed infantry in their due array, and the javelin-men by themselves, and the archers separately, and the slingers in like manner, and sets each force in its appropriate position, in order that all those equipped in the same way may engage together. But if these teachers think that this illustration is but a joke, because I institute a comparison between very large bodies and very small, we may pass to the very smallest.","index":"43","references":[{"fn":"14","code":"P1416_396934","folder":"ANF-06","text":"ou0si/aj.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1417_397010","folder":"ANF-06","text":"fu/sew|j.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1418_397163","folder":"ANF-06","text":"a0kh/rata.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1419_397192","folder":"ANF-06","text":"ai0w/nia.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1420_397244","folder":"ANF-06","text":"makrai/wna.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1421_398011","folder":"ANF-06","text":"perse/a, a sacred tree of Egypt and Persia, the fruit of which grew from the stem.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1422_398576","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Job xiv. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"job","chapter":14,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1423_398702","folder":"ANF-06","text":"The text gives diafqora=j, for which Viger suggests diafora=j.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1424_399430","folder":"ANF-06","text":"filokri/nwn.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1425_400397","folder":"ANF-06","text":"1 Cor. xv. 41.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":15,"verses":[41]}]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1426_400518","folder":"ANF-06","text":"a0yu/xwn.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1427_400754","folder":"ANF-06","text":"a0gela/rxhj.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"Then we have what follows:-But if neither the word, nor the choice, nor the order of a ruler is laid upon them, and if by their own act they keep themselves right in the vast commotion of the stream in which they move, and convey themselves safely through the mighty uproar of the collisions, and if like atoms meet and group themselves with like, not as being brought together by God, according to the poet's fancy, but rather as naturally recognising the affinities subsisting between each other, then truly we have here a most marvellous democracy of atoms, wherein friends welcome and embrace friends, and all are eager to sojourn together in one domicile; while some by their own determination have rounded themselves off into that mighty luminary the sun, so as to make day; and others have formed themselves into many pyramids of blazing stars, it may be, so as to crown also the whole heavens; and others have reduced themselves into the circular figure, so as to impart a certain solidity to the ether, and arch it over, and constitute it a vast graduated ascent of luminaries, with this object also, that the various conventions of the commoner atoms may select settlements for themselves, and portion out the sky among them for their habitations and stations.","index":"44","references":[]},{"text":"Then, after certain other matters, the discourse proceeds thus:-But inconsiderate men do not see even things that are apparent, and certainly they are far from being cognisant of things that are unapparent.

And how did that little seed of generation draw together the many atoms that were to constitute Epicurus, and change some of them into skin and flesh for a covering, and make bone of others for erectness and strength, and form sinews of others for compact contexture? And how did it frame and adapt the many other members and parts-heart and bowels, and organs of sense, some within and some without-by which the body is made a thing of life?

So, then, we have the ministry of the hands, by which all kinds of works are wrought, and all skilful professions practised, and which have all their various faculties furnished them, with a view to the discharge of one common function; and we have the shoulders, with their capacity for bearing burdens; and the fingers, with their power of grasping; and the elbows, with their faculty of bending, by which they can turn inwardly, upon the body, or take an outward inclination, so as to be able either to draw objects toward the body, or to thrust them away from it. We have also the service of the feet, by which the whole terrestrial creation is made to come under our power, the earth itself is traversed thereby, the sea is made navigable, the rivers are crossed, and intercourse is established for all with all things. The belly, too, is the storehouse of meats, with all its parts arranged in their proper collocations, so that it apportions for itself the right measure of aliment, and ejects what is over and above that. And so is it with all the other things by which manifestly the due administration of the constitution of man is wisely secured.[fn-14-P1448_412519:67-nf] Of all these, the intelligent and the unintelligent alike enjoy the same use; but they have not the same comprehension of them.[fn-14-P1449_412900:68-nf] For there are some who refer this whole economy to a power which they conceive to be a true divinity,[fn-14-P1450_413168:69-nf] and which they apprehend as at once the highest intelligence in all things, and the best benefactor to themselves, believing that this economy is all the work of a wisdom and a might which are superior to every other, and in themselves truly divine. And there are others who aimlessly attribute this whole structure of most marvellous beauty to chance and fortuitous coincidence. And in addition to these, there are also certain physicians, who, having made a more effective examination into all these things, and having investigated with utmost accuracy the disposition of the inward parts in especial, have been struck with astonishment at the results of their inquiry, and have been led to deify nature itself.

Was it, as they say, the irrational multitude of atoms? Nay, these, by their conjunctions, could not mould even an image of clay, neither could they hew and polish a statue of stone; nor could they cast and finish an idol of silver or gold; but arts and handicrafts calculated for such operations have been discovered by men who fabricate these objects.[fn-14-P1452_415424:71-nf] And if, even in these, representations and models cannot be made without the aid of wisdom, how can the genuine and original patterns of these copies have come into existence spontaneously? And whence have come the soul, and the intelligence, and the reason, which are born with the philosopher? Has he gathered these from those atoms which are destitute alike of soul, and intelligence, and reason? and has each of these atoms inspired him with some appropriate conception and notion?

But those, on the other hand, who have made some advance, and much more those who are perfectly trained in the art, accomplish easily and successfully the objects of their labours, and have great pleasure in the work, and would choose rather thus, in the discharge of the pursuits to which they are accustomed, to finish and carry perfectly out what their efforts aim at, than to be made masters of all those things which are reckoned advantageous among men. Yea, Democritus himself, as it is reported, averred that he would prefer the discovery of one true cause to being put in possession of the kingdom of Persia. And that was the declaration of a man who had only a vain and groundless conception of the causes of things,[fn-14-P1466_419095:79-nf] inasmuch as he started with an unfounded principle, and an erroneous hypothesis, and did not discern the real root and the common law of necessity in the constitution of natural things, and held as the greatest wisdom the apprehension of things that come about simply in an unintelligent and random way, and set up chance[fn-14-P1467_419554:80-nf] as the mistress and queen of things universal, and even things divine, and endeavoured to demonstrate that all things happen by the determination of the same, although at the same time he kept it outside the sphere of the life of men, and convicted those of senselessness who worshipped it. At any rate, at the very beginning of his Precepts[fn-14-P1468_419909:81-nf] he speaks thus: \"Men have made an image[fn-14-P1469_419966:82-nf] of chance, as a cover[fn-14-P1470_420004:83-nf] for their own lack of knowledge. For intellect and chance are in their very nature antagonistic to each other.[fn-14-P1471_420131:84-nf] And men have maintained that this greatest adversary to intelligence is its sovereign. Yea, rather, they completely subvert and do away, with the one, while they establish the other in its place. For they do not celebrate intelligence as the fortunate,[fn-14-P1472_420570:85-nf] but they laud chance[fn-14-P1473_420606:86-nf] as the most intelligent.\"[fn-14-P1474_420654:87-nf] Moreover, those who attend to things conducing to the good of life, take special pleasure in what serves the interests of those of the same race with themselves, and seek the recompense of praise and glory in return for labours undertaken in behalf of the general good; while some exert themselves as purveyors of ways and means,[fn-14-P1475_421006:88-nf] others as magistrates, others as physicians, others as statesmen; and even philosophers pride themselves greatly in their efforts after the education of men. Will, then, Epicurus or Democritus be bold enough to assert that in the exertion of philosophizing they only cause distress to themselves? Nay, rather they will reckon this a pleasure of mind second to none. For even though they maintain the opinion that the good is pleasure, they will be ashamed to deny that philosophizing is the greater pleasure to them.[fn-14-P1476_421539:89-nf] But as to the gods, of whom the poets among them sing that they are the \"bestowers of good gifts,\"[fn-14-P1477_421739:90-nf] these philosophers scoffingly celebrate them in strains like these: \"The gods are neither the bestowers nor the sharers in any good thing.\" And in what manner, forsooth, can they demonstrate that there are gods at all, when they neither perceive their presence, nor discern them as the doers of aught, wherein, indeed, they resemble those who, in their admiration and wonder at the sun and the moon and the stars, have held these to have been named gods,[fn-14-P1478_422255:91-nf] from their running[fn-14-P1479_422287:92-nf] such courses: when, further, they do not attribute to them any function or power of operation,[fn-14-P1480_422404:93-nf] so as to bold them gods[fn-14-P1481_422470:94-nf] from their constituting,[fn-14-P1482_422514:95-nf] that is, from their making objects,[fn-14-P1483_422573:96-nf] for thereby in all truth the one maker and operator of all things must be God: and when, in fine, they do not set forth any administration, or judgment, or beneficence of theirs in relation to men, so that we might be bound either by fear or by reverence to worship them? Has Epicurus then been able, forsooth, to see beyond this world, and to overpass the precincts of heaven? or has he gone forth by some secret gates known to himself alone, and thus obtained sight of the gods in the void?[fn-14-P1484_423081:97-nf] and, deeming them blessed in their full felicity, and then becoming himself a passionate aspirant after such pleasure, and an ardent scholar in that life which they pursue in the void, does he now call upon all to participate in this felicity, and urge them thus to make themselves like the gods, preparing[fn-14-P1485_423480:98-nf] as their true symposium of blessedness neither heaven nor Olympus, as the poets feign, but the sheer void, and setting before them the ambrosia of atoms,[fn-14-P1486_423651:99-nf] and pledging them in[fn-14-P1487_423729:100-nf] nectar made of the same? However, in matters which have no relation to us, he introduces into his books a myriad oaths and solemn asseverations, swearing constantly both negatively and affirmatively by Jove, and making those whom he meets, and with whom he discusses his doctrines, swear also by the gods, not certainly that he fears them himself, or has any dread of perjury, but that he pronounces all this to be vain, and false, and idle, and unintelligible, and uses it simply as a kind of accompaniment to his words, just as he might also clear his throat, or spit, or twist his face, or move his hand. So completely senseless and empty a pretence was this whole matter of the naming of the gods, in his estimation. But this is also a very patent fact, that, being in fear of the Athenians after (the warning of) the death of Socrates, and being desirous of preventing his being taken for what he really was-an atheist-the subtle charlatan invented for them certain empty shadows of unsubstantial gods. But never surely did he look up to heaven with eyes of true intelligence, so as to hear the clear voice from above, which another attentive spectator did hear, and of which he testified when he said, \"The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth His handiwork.\"[fn-14-P1488_425051:101-nf] And never surely did he look down upon the world's surface with due reflection l for then would he have learned that \"the earth is full of the goodness of the Lord\"[fn-14-P1489_425235:102-nf] and that \"the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; \"[fn-14-P1490_425319:103-nf] and that, as we also read, \"After this the Lord looked upon the earth, and filled it with His blessings.

It is for them, however, to show us plainly how it can possibly be that the like and the unlike should be predicated as subsisting together in God and matter. For it becomes necessary thus to think of one as a superior to either, and that is a thought which cannot legitimately be entertained with regard to God. For if there is this defect of generation which is said to be the thing like in both, and if there is this point of difference which is conceived of besides in the two, whence has this arisen in them? If, indeed, God is the ungenerated, and if this defect of generation is, as we may say, His very essence, then matter cannot be ungenerated; for God and matter are not one and the same. But if each subsists properly and independently-namely, God and matter-and if the defect of generation also belongs to both, then it is evident that there is something different from each, and older and higher than both. But the difference of their contrasted constitutions is completely subversive of the idea that these can subsist on an equality together, and more, that this one of the two-namely, matter-can subsist of itself. For then they will have to furnish an explanation of the fact that, though both are supposed to be ungenerated, God is nevertheless impassible, immutable, imperturbable, energetic; while matter is the opposite, impressible, mutable, variable, alterable. And now, how can these properties harmoniously co-exist and unite? Is it that God has adapted Himself to the nature of the matter, and thus has skilfully wrought it? But it would be absurd to suppose that God works in gold, as men are wont to do, or hews or polishes stone, or puts His hand to any of the other arts by which different kinds of matter are made capable of receiving form and figure. But if, on the other hand, He has fashioned matter according to His own will, and after the dictates of His own wisdom, impressing upon it the rich and manifold forms produced by His own operation, then is this account of ours one both good and true, and still further one that establishes the position that the ungenerated God is the hypostasis (the life and foundation) of all things in the universe. For with this fact of the defect of generation it conjoins the proper mode of His being. Much, indeed, might be said in confutation of these teachers, but that is not what is before us at present.

And in these things I have also proved the falsehood of the charge which they bring against me-to wit, that I do not maintain that Christ is consubstantial with God. For although I say that I have never either found or read this word in the sacred Scriptures, yet other reasonings, which I immediately subjoined, are in no wise discrepant from this view, because I brought forward as an illustration human offspring, which assuredly is of the same kind as the begetter; and I said that parents are absolutely distinguished from their children by the fact alone that they themselves are not their children, or that it would assuredly be a matter of necessity that there would neither be parents nor children.

However, it will be acknowledged cordially by all, that from the date of the resurrection of our Lord, those who up to that time have been humbling their souls with fastings, ought at once to begin their festal joy and gladness. But in what you have written to me you have made out very clearly, and with an intelligent understanding of the Holy Scriptures, that no very exact account seems to be offered in them of the hour at which He rose. For the evangelists have given different descriptions of the parties who came to the sepulchre one after another,[fn-15-P1582_445884:141-nf] and all have declared that they found the Lord risen already. It was \"in the end of the Sabbath,\" as Matthew has said;[fn-15-P1583_446042:142-nf] it was \"early, when it was yet dark,\" as John writes;[fn-15-P1584_446120:143-nf] it was \"very early in the morning,\" as Luke puts it; and it was \"very early in the morning, at the rising of the sun,\" as Mark tells us. Thus no one has shown us clearly the exact time when He rose. It is admitted, however, that those who came to the sepulchre in the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week,[fn-15-P1585_446481:144-nf] found Him no longer lying in it. And let us not suppose that the evangelists disagree or contradict each other. But even although there may seem to be some small difficulty as to the subject of our inquiry, if they all agree that the light of the world, our Lord, rose on that one night, while they differ with respect to the hour, we may well seek with wise and faithful mind to harmonize their statements. The narrative by Matthew then, runs thus: \"In the end of the Sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week,[fn-15-P1586_447058:145-nf] came Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, to see the sepulchre. And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone, and sat upon it. And his countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: and for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men. And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. He is not here; for He is risen, as He said.\"[fn-15-P1587_447611:146-nf] Now this phrase \"in the end\" will be thought by some to signify, according to the common use[fn-15-P1588_447730:147-nf] of the word, the evening: of the Sabbath; while others, with a better perception of the fact, will say that it does not indicate that, but a late hour in the night,[fn-15-P1589_447914:148-nf] as the phrase \"in the end\"[fn-15-P1590_447965:149-nf] denotes slowness and length of time. Also because he speaks of night, and not of evening, he has added the words, \"as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week.\" And the parties here did not come yet, as the others say, \"bearing spices,\" but \"to see the sepulchre; \"and they discovered the occurrence of the earthquake, and the angel sitting upon the stone, and heard from him the declaration, \"He is not here, He is risen.\" And to the same effect is the testimony of John. \"The first day of the week,\" says he, \"came Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.\"[fn-15-P1591_448627:150-nf] Only, according to this \"when it was yet dark,\" she had come in advance.[fn-15-P1592_448719:151-nf] And Luke says: \"They rested the Sabbath-day, according to the commandment. Now, upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared; and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.\"[fn-15-P1593_449025:152-nf] This phrase \"very early in the morning\"[fn-15-P1594_449100:153-nf] probably indicates the early dawn[fn-15-P1595_449157:154-nf] of the first day of the week; and thus, when the Sabbath itself was wholly past, and also the whole night succeeding it, and when another day had begun, they came, bringing spices and myrrh, and then it became apparent that He had already risen long before. And Mark follows this, and says: \"They had bought sweet spices, in order that they might come and anoint Him. And very early (in the morning), the first day of the week, they come unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.\"[fn-15-P1596_449698:155-nf] For this evangelist also has used the term \"very early,\" which is just the same as the \"very early in the morning\" employed by the former; and he has added, \"at the rising of the sun.\" Thus they set out, and took their way first when it was \"very early in the morning,\" or (as Mark says) when it was \"very early; \"but on the road, and by their stay at the sepulchre, they spent the time till it was sunrise. And then the young man clad in white said to them, \"He is risen, He is not here.\" As the case stands thus, we make the following statement and explanation to those who seek an exact account of the specific hour, or half-hour, or quarter of an hour, at which it is proper to begin their rejoicing over our Lord's rising from the dead. Those who are too hasty, and give up even before midnight,[fn-15-P1597_450522:156-nf] we reprehend as remiss and intemperate, and as almost breaking off from their course in their precipitation,[fn-15-P1598_450685:157-nf] for it is a wise man's word, \"That is not little in life which is within a little.\" And those who hold out and continue for a very long time, and persevere even on to the fourth watch, which is also the time at which our Saviour manifested Himself walking upon the sea to those who were then on the deep, we receive as noble and laborious disciples. On those, again, who pause and refresh themselves in the course as they are moved or as they are able, let us not press very hard:[fn-15-P1599_451219:158-nf] for all do not carry out the six days of fasting[fn-16-P1600_451444:159-nf] either equally or alike; but some pass even all the days as a fast, remaining without food through the whole; while others take but two, and others three, and others four, and others not even one. And to those who have laboured painfully through these protracted fasts. and have thereafter become exhausted and well-nigh undone, pardon ought to be extended if they are somewhat precipitate in taking food. But if there are any who not only decline such protracted fasting, but refuse at the first to fast at all, and rather indulge themselves luxuriously during the first four days, and then when they reach the last two days-viz., the preparation and the Sabbath-fast with due rigour during these, and these alone, and think that they do something grand and brilliant if they hold out till the morning, I cannot think that they have gone through the time on equal terms with those who have been practising the same during several days before. This is the counsel which, in accordance with my apprehension of the question, I have offered you in writing on these matters.[fn-16-P1601_452602:160-nf] ","index":"94","references":[{"fn":"15","code":"P1577_443342","folder":"ANF-06","text":"a\\ponhstizesqai dei=.
