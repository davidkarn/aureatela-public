I have often remarked the condensation of valuable information given by Dr. Murdock in his notes upon Mosheim, but he fails to get in the half that needs to be noted.[fn-41-P4173_1229997:14-nf] He tells us that \"Alexander of Lycopolis flourished probably about a.d. 350.\" He adds, \"Fabricius supposes that he was first a Pagan and a Manichee, and afterwards a Catholic Christian. Cave is of the same opinion. Beausobre thinks he was a mere pagan.[fn-41-P4174_1230397:15-nf] Lardner thinks he was a Gentile, but well acquainted with the Manichees and other Christians,[fn-41-P4175_1230556:16-nf] and that he had some knowledge of the Old and New Testaments, to which he occasionally refers. He speaks with respect of Christ and the Christian philosophy, and appears to have been \"a learned and candid man.\" Of an eminent Christian bishop, all this seems very puzzling; and I feel it a sort of duty to the youthful student to give the statements of the learned Lardner in an abridged form, with such references to the preceding pages as may serve in place of a series of elucidations.","index":"2","references":[{"fn":"41","code":"P4173_1229997","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Mosheim, E.
