For for this cause the month Abib was appointed by the law to be the beginning of months, and was made known unto us as the first among the months of the year; both by the ancient writers who lived before, and by the later who lived after the destruction of Jerusalem, it was shown to possess a most clear and evidently definite period, especially because in some places the reaping is early, and sometimes it is late, so as to be sometimes before the time and sometimes after it, as it happened in the very beginning of the giving of the law, before the Passover, according as it is written, \"But the wheat and the rye were not smitten, for they were not grown up.\"[fn-45-P4509_1360713:16-nf] Whence it is rightly prescribed by the law, that from the vernal equinox, in whatsoever week the fourteenth day of the first month shall fall, in it the Passover is to be celebrated, becoming and conformable songs of praise having been first taken up for its celebration. For this first month, says he, \"shall be unto you the beginning of months,\"[fn-45-P4510_1361080:17-nf] when the sun in the summer-time sends forth a far stronger and clearer light, and the days are lengthened and become longer, whilst the nights are contracted and shortened. Moreover, when the new seeds have sprung up, they are thoroughly purged, and borne into the threshing floor; nor only this, but also all the shrubs blossom, and burst forth into flower. Immediately therefore they are discovered to send forth in alternation various and diverse fruits, so that the grape-clusters are found at thattime; as says the lawgiver, \"Now, it was the time of spring, of the first ripe grapes; \"[fn-45-P4511_1361690:18-nf] and when he sent the men to spy out the land, they brought, on bearers, a large cluster of grapes, and pomegranates also, and figs.

But after the destruction of the city it was mocked at by some hardening of heart, which we observing, according to the law, with sincerity have received; and in this, according to the Word, when he speaks of the day of our holy festivity, which the election bath attained: but the rest have become hardened,[fn-45-P4513_1362772:20-nf] as said the Scripture; and after other things.","index":"24","references":[{"fn":"45","code":"P4509_1360713","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Exod. ix. 32.","bible_refs":[{"book":"exodus","chapter":9,"verses":[32]}]},{"fn":"45","code":"P4510_1361080","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Exod. xii. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"exodus","chapter":12,"verses":[2]}]},{"fn":"45","code":"P4511_1361690","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Num. xii. 24.","bible_refs":[{"book":"numbers","chapter":12,"verses":[24]}]},{"fn":"45","code":"P4512_1362169","folder":"ANF-06","text":"As \"in summer-time,\" probably.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"45","code":"P4513_1362772","folder":"ANF-06","text":"\"Our holy festivity\" = Easter.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"2.

That therefore up to the period of the Lord's Passion, and at the time of the last destruction of Jerusalem, which happened under Vespasian, the Roman emperor, the people of Israel, rightly observing the fourteenth day of the first lunar month, celebrated on it the Passover of the law, has been briefly demonstrated.Therefore, when the holy prophets, and all, as I have said, who righteously and justly walked in the law of the Lord, together with the entire people, celebrated a typical and shadowy Passover, the Creator and Lord of every visible and invisible creature, the only-begotten Son, and the Word co-eternal with the Father and the Holy Spirit, and of the same substance with them, according to His divine nature, our Lord and God, Jesus Christ, being in the end of the world born according to the flesh of our holy and glorious lady, Mother of God, and Ever-Virgin, and, of a truth, of Mary the Mother of God; and being seen upon earth, and having true and real converse as man with men, who were of the same substance with Him, according to His human nature, Himself also, with the people, in the years before His public ministry and during His public ministry, did celebrate the legal and shadowy Passover, eating the typical lamb. For \"I came not to destroy the law, or the prophets, but to fulfil them,\" the Saviour Himself said in the Gospel.","index":"30","references":[]},{"text":"But after His public ministry He did not eat of the lamb,[fn-45-P4525_1368451:25-nf] but Himself suffered as the true Lamb in the Paschal feast, as John, the divine and evangelist, teaches us in the Gospel written by him, where he thus speaks: \"Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment-hall, lest they should be defined, but that they might eat the passover.\"[fn-45-P4526_1368907:26-nf] And after a few things more. \"When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment-seat, in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha. And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the third hour,\"[fn-45-P4527_1369198:27-nf] as the correct books render it, and the copy itself that was written by the hand of the evangelist, which, by the divine grace, has been preserved in the most holy church of Ephesus, and is there adored by the faithful. And again the same evangelist says: \"The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the Sabbath-day (for that Sabbath-day was an high day), besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.\"[fn-45-P4528_1370040:28-nf] On that day, therefore, on which the Jews were about to eat the Passover in the evening, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ was crucified, being made the victim to those who were about to partake by faith of the mystery concerning Him, according to what is written by the blessed Paul: \"For even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us; \"[fn-45-P4529_1370398:29-nf] and not as some who, carried along by ignorance, confidently affirm that after He had eaten the Passover, He was betrayed; which we neither learn from the holy evangelists, nor has any of the blessed apostles handed it down to us. At the time, therefore, in which our Lord and God Jesus Christ suffered for us, according to the flesh, He did not eat of the legal Passover; but, as I have said, He Himself, as the true Lamb, was sacrificed for us in the feast of the typical Passover, on the day of the preparation, the fourteenth of the first lunar month. The typical Passover, therefore, then ceased, the true Passover being present: \"For Christ our Passover was sacrificed for us,\" as has been before said, and as that chosen vessel, the apostle Paul, teaches.[fn-45-P4530_1371179:30-nf] ","index":"31","references":[{"fn":"45","code":"P4525_1368451","folder":"ANF-06","text":"But compare Browne, On the Thirty-nine Articles, p. 717, note 3, American edition, 1874.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"45","code":"P4526_1368907","folder":"ANF-06","text":"John xviii. 28.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":18,"verses":[28]}]},{"fn":"45","code":"P4527_1369198","folder":"ANF-06","text":"John xix. 13, 14.
