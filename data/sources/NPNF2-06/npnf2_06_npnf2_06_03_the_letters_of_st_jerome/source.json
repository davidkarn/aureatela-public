I have declined the task from modesty and, as I now feel, with justice, believing myself to be incapable of it, at once because bureau language is inadequate to the divine praise, and because inactivity, acting like rust upon the intellect, has dried up any little power of expression that I have ever had. You in reply urge that in the things of God we must look not at the work which we are able to accomplish, but at the spirit in which it is undertaken, and that he can never be at a loss for words who has believed on the Word.","index":"154","references":[]},{"text":"2. What, then, must I do? The task is beyond me, and yet I dare not decline it. I am a mere unskilled passenger, and I find myself placed in charge of a freighted ship. I have not so much as handled a rowboat on a lake, and now I have to trust myself to the noise and turmoil of the Euxine. I see the shores sinking beneath the horizon, \"sky and sea on every side\";1 darkness lowers over the water, the clouds are black as night, the waves only are white with foam. You urge me to hoist the swelling sails, to loosen the sheets, and to take the helm. At last I obey your commands, and as charity can do all things, I will trust in the Holy Ghost to guide my course, and I shall console myself, whatever the event. For, if our ship is wafted by the surf into the wished-for haven, I shall be content to be told that the pilotage was poor. But, if through my unpolished diction we run aground amid the rough cross-currents of language, you may blame my lack of power, but you will at least recognize my good intentions.","index":"155","references":[]},{"text":"3. To begin, then: Vercellae is a Ligurian town, situated not far from the base of the Alps, once important, but now sparsely peopled and fallen into decay. When the consular2 was holding his visitation there, a poor woman and her paramour were brought before him-the charge of adultery had been fastened upon them by the husband-and were both consigned to the penal horrors of a prison. Shortly after an attempt was made to elicit the truth by torture, and when the blood-stained hook smote the young man's livid flesh and tore furrows in his side, the unhappy wretch sought to avoid prolonged pain by a speedy death. Falsely accusing his own passions, he involved another in the charge; and it appeared that he was of all men the most miserable, and that his execution was just inasmuch as he had left to an innocent woman no means of self-defence. But the woman, stronger in virtue if weaker in sex, though her frame was stretched upon the rack, and though her hands, stained with the filth of the prison, were tied behind her, looked up to heaven with her eyes, which alone the torturer had been unable to bind, and while the tears rolled down her face, said: \"Thou art witness, Lord Jesus, to whom nothing is hid, who triest the reins and the heart.3 Thou art witness that it is not to save my life that I deny this charge. I refuse to lie because to lie is sin. And as for you, unhappy man, if you are bent on hastening your death, why must you destroy not one innocent person, but two? I also, myself, desire to die. I desire to put off this hated body, but not as an adulteress. I offer my neck; I welcome the shining sword without fear; yet I will take my innocence with me. He does not die who is slain while purposing so to live.\"","index":"156","references":[]},{"text":"4. The consular, who had been feasting his eyes upon the bloody spectacle, now, like a wild beast, which after once tasting blood always thirsts for it, ordered the torture to be doubled, and cruelly gnashing his teeth, threatened the executioner with like punishment if he failed to extort from the weaker sex a confession which a man's strength had not been able to keep back.","index":"157","references":[]},{"text":"5. Send help, Lord Jesus. For this one creature of Thine every species of torture is devised. She is bound by the hair to a stake, her whole body is fixed more firmly than ever on the rack; fire is brought and applied to her feet; her sides quiver beneath the executioner's probe; even her breasts do not escape. Still the woman remains unshaken; and, triumphing in spirit over the pain of the body, enjoys the happiness of a good conscience, round which the tortures rage in vain.4 The cruel judge rises, overcome with passion. She still prays to God. Her limbs are wrenched from their sockets she only turns her eyes to heaven. Another confesses what is thought their common guilt. She, for the confessor's sake, denies the confession, and, in peril of her own life, clears one who is in peril of his.","index":"158","references":[]},{"text":"6. Meantime she has but one thing to say \"Beat me, burn me, tear me, if you will; I have not done it. If you will not believe my words, a day will come when this charge shall be carefully sifted. I have One who will judge me.\" Wearied out at last, the torturer sighed in response to her groans; nor could he find a spot on which to inflict a fresh wound. His cruelty overcome, he shuddered to see the body he had torn. Immediately the consular cried, in a fit of passion, \"Why does it surprise you, bystanders, that a woman prefers torture to death? It takes two people, most assuredly, to commit adultery; and I think it more credible that a guilty woman should deny a sin than that an innocent young man should confess one.\"","index":"159","references":[]},{"text":"7. Like sentence, accordingly, was passed on both, and the condemned pair were dragged to execution. The entire people poured out to see the sight; indeed, so closely were the gates thronged by the out-rushing crowd, that you might have fancied the city itself to be migrating. At the very first stroke of the sword the head of the hapless youth was cut off, and the headless trunk rolled over in its blood. Then came the woman's turn. She knelt down upon the ground, and the shining sword was lifted over her quivering neck. But though the headsman summoned all his strength into his bared arm, the moment it touched her flesh the fatal blade stopped short, and, lightly glancing over the skin, merely grazed it sufficiently to draw blood. The striker saw, with terror, his hand unnerved, and, amazed at his defeated skill and at his drooping sword, he whirled it aloft for another stroke. Again the blade fell forceless on the woman, sinking harmlessly on her neck, as though the steel feared to touch her. The enraged and panting officer, who had thrown open his cloak at the neck to give his full strength to the blow, shook to the ground the brooch which clasped the edges of his mantle, and not noticing this, began to poise his sword for a fresh stroke. \"See,\" cried the woman, \"a jewel has fallen from your shoulder. Pick up what you have earned by hard toil, that you may not lose it.\"","index":"160","references":[]},{"text":"8. What, I ask, is the secret of such confidence as this? Death draws near, but it has no terrors for her. When smitten she exults, and the executioner turns pale. Her eyes see the brooch, they fail to see the sword. And, as if intrepidity in the presence of death were not enough, she confers a favor upon her cruel foe. And now the mysterious Power of the Trinity rendered even a third blow vain. The terrified soldier, no longer trusting the blade, proceeded to apply the point to her throat, in the idea that though it might not cut, the pressure of his hand might plunge it into her flesh. Marvel unheard of through all the ages! The sword bent back to the hilt, and in its defeat looked to its master, as if confessing its inability to slay.","index":"161","references":[]},{"text":"9. Let me call to my aid the example of the three children,5 who, amid the cool, encircling fire, sang hymns,6 instead of weeping, and around whose turbans and holy hair the flames played harmlessly. Let me recall, too, the story of the blessed Daniel,7 in whose presence, though he was their natural prey, the lions crouched, with fawning tails and frightened mouths. Let Susannah also rise in the nobility of her faith before the thoughts of all; who, after she had been condemned by an unjust sentence, was saved through a youth inspired by the Holy Ghost.8 In both cases the Lord's mercy was alike shewn; for while Susannah was set free by the judge, so as not to die by the sword, this woman, though condemned by the judge, was acquitted by the sword.","index":"162","references":[]},{"text":"10. Now at length the populace rise in arms to defend the woman. Men and women of every age join in driving away the executioner, shouting round him in a surging crowd. Hardly a man dares trust his own eyes. The disquieting news reaches the city close at hand, and the entire force of constables is mustered. The officer who is responsible for the execution of criminals bursts from among his men, and","index":"163","references":[]},{"text":"Staining his hoary hair with soiling dust,9 ","index":"164","references":[]},{"text":"exclaims: \"What! citizens, do you mean to seek my life? Do you intend to make me a substitute for her? However much your minds are set on mercy, and however much you wish to save a condemned woman, yet assuredly I-I who am innocent-ought not to perish.\" His tearful appeal tells upon the crowd, they are all benumbed by the influence of sorrow, and an extraordinary change of feeling is manifested. Before it had seemed a duty to plead for the woman's life, now it seemed a duty to allow her to be executed.","index":"165","references":[]},{"text":"11. Accordingly a new sword is fetched, a new headsman appointed. The victim takes her place, once more strengthened only with the favor of Christ. The first blow makes her quiver, beneath the second she sways to and fro, by the third she falls wounded to the ground. Oh, majesty of the divine power highly to be extolled! She who previously had received four strokes without injury, now, a few moments later, seems to die that an innocent man may not perish in her stead.","index":"166","references":[]},{"text":"12.

Suddenly the woman's bosom heaves, her eyes seek the light, her body is quickened into new life. A moment after she sighs, she looks round, she gets up and speaks. At last she is able to cry: \"The Lord is on my side; I will not fear.

If you think fit enact a decree; and then I shall not hesitate to speak of three hypostases. Order a new creed to supersede the Nicene; and then, whether we are Arians or orthodox, one confession will do for us all. In the whole range of secular learning hypostasis never means anything but essence. And can any one, I ask, be so profane as to speak of three essences or substances in the Godhead? There is one nature of God and one only; and this, and this alone, truly is. For absolute being is derived from no other source but is all its own. All things besides, that is all things created, although they appear to be, are not. For there was a time when they were not, and that which once was not may again cease to be. God alone who is eternal, that is to say, who has no beginning, really deserves to be called an essence. Therefore also He says to Moses from the bush, \"I am that I am,\" and Moses says of Him, \"I am hath sent me.\"[fn-5-P507_95261:288-nf] As the angels, the sky, the earth, the seas, all existed at the time, it must have been as the absolute being that God claimed for himself that name of essence, which apparently was common to all. But because His nature alone is perfect, and because in the three persons there subsists but one Godhead, which truly is and is one nature; whosoever in the name of religion declares that there are in the Godhead three elements, three hypostases, that is, or essences, is striving really to predicate three natures of God. And if this is true, why are we severed by walls from Arius, when in dishonesty we are one with him? Let Ursicinus be made the colleague of your blessedness; let Auxentius be associated with Ambrose.[fn-5-P508_96001:289-nf] But may the faith of Rome never come to such a pass! May the devout hearts of your people never be infected with such unholy doctrines! Let us be satisfied to speak of one substance and of three subsisting persons-perfect, equal, coeternal.

I used to sit alone because I was filled with bitterness. Sackcloth disfigured my unshapely limbs and my skin from long neglect had become as black as an Ethiopian's. Tears and groans were every day my portion; and if drowsiness chanced to overcome my struggles against it, my bare bones, which hardly held together, clashed against the ground. Of my food and drink I say nothing: for, even in sickness, the solitaries have nothing but cold water, and to eat one's food cooked is looked upon as self-indulgence. Now, although in my fear of hell I had consigned myself to this prison, where I had no companions but scorpions and wild beasts, I often found myself amid bevies of girls. My face was pale and my frame chilled with fasting; yet my mind was burning with desire, and the fires of lust kept bubbling up before me when my flesh was as good as dead. Helpless, I cast myself at the feet of Jesus, I watered them with my tears, I wiped them with my hair: and then I subdued my rebellious body with weeks of abstinence. I do not blush to avow my abject misery; rather I lament that I am not now what once I was. I remember how I often cried aloud all night till the break of day and ceased not from beating my breast till tranquillity returned at the chiding of the Lord. I used to dread my very cell as though it knew my thoughts; and, stern and angry with myself, I used to make my way alone into the desert. Wherever I saw hollow valleys, craggy mountains, steep cliffs, there I made my oratory, there the house of correction for my unhappy flesh. There, also-the Lord Himself is my witness-when I had shed copious tears and had strained my eyes towards heaven, I sometimes felt myself among angelic hosts, and for joy and gladness sang: \"because of the savour of thy good ointments we will run after thee.\"[fn-6-P653_125784:391-nf] ","index":"316","references":[{"fn":"6","code":"P653_125784","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Cant. i. 3, Cant. i. 4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"song of solomon","chapter":1,"verses":[3]},{"book":"song of solomon","chapter":1,"verses":[4]}]}]},{"text":"8.

Other vices we easily escape, but this enemy is shut up within us, and wherever we go we carry him with us. Wine and youth between them kindle the fire of sensual pleasure.

Why do you, then, wrong your husband? Why do you, God's bride, hasten to visit the wife of a mere man? Learn in this respect a holy pride; know that you are better than they. And not only must you avoid intercourse with those who are puffed up by their husbands' honors, who are hedged in with troops of eunuchs, and who wear robes inwrought with threads of gold. You must also shun those who are widows from necessity and not from choice. Not that they ought to have desired the death of their husbands; but that they have not welcomed the opportunity of continence when it has come. As it is, they only change their garb; their old self-seeking remains unchanged. To see them in their capacious litters, with red cloaks and plump bodies, a row of eunuchs walking in front of them, you would fancy them not to have lost husbands but to be seeking them. Their houses are filled with flatterers and with guests. The very clergy, who ought to inspire them with respect by their teaching and authority, kiss these ladies on the forehead, and putting forth their hands (so that, if you knew no better, you might suppose them in the act of blessing), take wages for their visits. They, meanwhile, seeing that priests cannot do without them, are lifted up into pride; and as, having had experience of both, they prefer the license of widowhood to the restraints of marriage, they call themselves chaste livers and nuns. After an immoderate supper they retire to rest to dream of the apostles.[fn-7-P708_141206:436-nf] ","index":"326","references":[{"fn":"7","code":"P708_141206","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Cena dubia.

For you will never need a pretext for going out if you always go out when there is need. Take food in moderation, and never overload your stomach. For many women, while temperate as regards wine, are intemperate in the use of food. When you rise at night to pray, let your breath be that of an empty and not that of an overfull stomach. Read often, learn all that you can. Let sleep overcome you, the roll still in your hands; when your head falls, let it be on the sacred page. Let your fasts be of daily occurrence and your refreshment such as avoids satiety. It is idle to carry an empty stomach if, in two or three days' time, the fast is to be made up for by repletion. When cloyed the mind immediately grows sluggish, and when the ground is watered it puts forth the thorns of lust. If ever you feel the outward man sighing for the flower of youth, and if, as you lie on your couch after a meal, you are excited by the alluring train of sensual desires; then seize the shield of faith, for it alone can quench the fiery darts of the devil.[fn-7-P713_142837:440-nf] \"They are all adulterers,\" says the prophet; \"they have made ready their heart like an oven.\"[fn-7-P714_142951:441-nf] But do you keep close to the footsteps of Christ, and, intent upon His words, say: \"Did not our heart burn within us by the way while Jesus opened to us the Scriptures?\"[fn-7-P715_143159:442-nf] and again: \"Thy word is tried to the uttermost, and thy servant loveth it.\"[fn-7-P716_143257:443-nf] It is hard for the human soul to avoid loving something, and our mind must of necessity give way to affection of one kind or another.

The apostle tells us, in a later verse: \"The time is short: it remaineth that those who have wives be as though they had none.\"[fn-7-P770_153860:492-nf] Nebuchadnezzar is hard at hand. The lion is bestirring himself from his lair. What good will marriage be to me if it is to end in slavery to the haughtiest of kings? What good will little ones be to me if their lot is to be that which the prophet sadly describes: \"The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst; the young children ask for bread and no man breaketh it unto them\"?[fn-7-P771_154294:493-nf] In those days, as I have said, the virtue of continence was found only in men: Eve still continued to travail with children. But now that a virgin has conceived[fn-7-P772_154474:494-nf] in the womb and has borne to us a child of which the prophet says that \"Government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called the mighty God, the everlasting Father,\"[fn-7-P773_154676:495-nf] now the chain of the curse is broken. Death came through Eve, but life has come through Mary. And thus the gift of virginity has been bestowed most richly upon women, seeing that it has had its beginning from a woman. As soon as the Son of God set foot upon the earth, He formed for Himself a new household there; that, as He was adored by angels in heaven, angels might serve Him also on earth. Then chaste Judith once more cut off the head of Holofernes.[fn-7-P774_155152:496-nf] Then Haman-whose name means iniquity-was once more burned in fire of his own kindling.[fn-7-P775_155260:497-nf] Then James and John forsook father and net and ship and followed the Saviour: neither kinship nor the world's ties, nor the care of their home could hold them back.

Do not wish to seem very devout nor more humble than need be, lest you seek glory by shunning it. For many, who screen from all men's sight their poverty, charity, and fasting, desire to excite admiration by their very disdain of it, and strangely seek for praise while they profess to keep out of its way. From the other disturbing influences which make men rejoice, despond, hope, and fear I find many free; but this is a defect which few are without, and he is best whose character, like a fair skin, is disfigured by the fewest blemishes.

It would be time wasted to write to you about it; for there is no greater folly than to teach a pupil what he knows already. But now that you have despised the boastfulness of the world, do not let the fact inspire you with new boastfulness. Harbor not the secret thought that having ceased to court attention in garments of gold you may begin to do so in mean attire. And when you come into a room full of brothers and sisters, do not sit in too low a place or plead that you are unworthy of a footstool. Do not deliberately lower your voice as though worn out with fasting; nor, leaning on the shoulder of another, mimic the tottering gait of one who is faint. Some women, it is true, disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast.[fn-8-P843_171260:557-nf] As soon as they catch sight of any one they groan, they look down; they cover up their faces, all but one eye, which they keep free to see with.

All these things are tokens of the devil. Such an one Rome groaned over some time back in Antimus; and Sophronius is a still more recent instance. Such persons, when they have once gained admission to the houses of the high-born, and have deceived \"silly women laden with sins, ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth,\"[fn-8-P848_172750:561-nf] feign a sad mien and pretend to make long fasts while at night they feast in secret. Shame forbids me to say more, for my language might appear more like invective than admonition. There are others-I speak of those of my own order-who seek the presbyterate and the diaconate simply that they may be able to see women with less restraint. Such men think of nothing but their dress; they use perfumes freely, and see that there are no creases in their leather shoes. Their curling hair shows traces of the tongs; their fingers glisten with rings; they walk on tiptoe across a damp road, not to splash their feet. When you see men acting in this way, think of them rather as bridegrooms than as clergymen. Certain persons have devoted the whole of their energies and life to the single object of knowing the names, houses, and characters of married ladies. I will here briefly describe the head of the profession, that from the master's likeness you may recognize the disciples. He rises and goes forth with the sun; he has the order of his visits duly arranged; he takes the shortest road; and, troublesome old man that he is, forces his way almost into the bedchambers of ladies yet asleep. If he sees a pillow that takes his fancy or an elegant table-cover-or indeed any article of household furniture-he praises it, looks admiringly at it, takes it into his hand, and, complaining that he has nothing of the kind, begs or rather extorts it from the owner. All the women, in fact, fear to cross the news-carrier of the town. Chastity and fasting are alike distasteful to him. What he likes is a savory breakfast-say off a plump young crane such as is commonly called a cheeper. In speech he is rude and forward, and is always ready to bandy reproaches. Wherever you turn he is the first man that you see before you. Whatever news is noised abroad he is either the originator of the rumor or its magnifier. He changes his horses every hour; and they are so sleek and spirited that you would take him for a brother of the Thracian king.[fn-8-P849_174822:562-nf] ","index":"341","references":[{"fn":"8","code":"P847_172291","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1 Cor. xi. 14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":11,"verses":[14]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P848_172750","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"2 Tim. iii. 6, 2 Tim. iii. 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 timothy","chapter":3,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"8","code":"P849_174822","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Diomede.

Many years ago, when for the kingdom of heaven's sake I had cut myself off from home, parents, sister, relations, and-harder still-from the dainty food to which I had been accustomed; and when I was on my way to Jerusalem to wage my warfare, I still could not bring myself to forego the library which I had formed for myself at Rome with great care and toil. And so, miserable man that I was, I would fast only that I might afterwards read Cicero. After many nights spent in vigil, after floods of tears called from my inmost heart, after the recollection of my past sins, I would once more take up Plautus. And when at times I returned to my right mind, and began to read the prophets, their style seemed rude and repellent. I failed to see the light with my blinded eyes; but I attributed the fault not to them, but to the sun. While the old serpent was thus making me his plaything, about the middle of Lent a deep-seated fever fell upon my weakened body, and while it destroyed my rest completely-the story seems hardly credible-it so wasted my unhappy frame that scarcely anything was left of me but skin and bone. Meantime preparations for my funeral went on; my body grew gradually colder, and the warmth of life lingered only in my throbbing breast. Suddenly I was caught up in the spirit and dragged before the judgment seat of the Judge; and here the light was so bright, and those who stood around were so radiant, that I cast myself upon the ground and did not dare to look up. Asked who and what I was I replied: \"I am a Christian.\" But He who presided said: \"Thou liest, thou art a follower of Cicero and not of Christ. For `where thy treasure is, there will thy heart be also.'\"[fn-8-P868_180486:576-nf] Instantly I became dumb, and amid the strokes of the lash-for He had ordered me to be scourged-I was tortured more severely still by the fire of conscience, considering with myself that verse, \"In the grave who shall give thee thanks?\"[fn-8-P869_180743:577-nf] Yet for all that I began to cry and to bewail myself, saying: \"Have mercy upon me, O Lord: have mercy upon me.\" Amid the sound of the scourges this cry still made itself heard. At last the bystanders, failing down before the knees of Him who presided, prayed that He would have pity on my youth, and that He would give me space to repent of my error. He might still, they urged, inflict torture on me, should I ever again read the works of the Gentiles. Under the stress of that awful moment I should have been ready to make even still larger promises than these. Accordingly I made oath and called upon His name, saying: \"Lord, if ever again I possess worldly books, or if ever again I read such, I have denied Thee.\" Dismissed, then, on taking this oath, I returned to the upper world, and, to the surprise of all, I opened upon them eyes so drenched with tears that my distress served to convince even the incredulous. And that this was no sleep nor idle dream, such as those by which we are often mocked, I call to witness the tribunal before which I lay, and the terrible judgment which I feared. May it never, hereafter, be my lot to fall under such an inquisition!

As there were about five thousand monks in the neighborhood, living in as many separate cells, a council was held as to what should be done. Some said that the coins should be distributed among the poor; others that they should be given to the church, while others were for sending them hack to the relatives of the deceased.

As I have mentioned the monks, and know that you like to hear about holy things, lend an ear to me for a few moments. There are in Egypt three classes of monks. First, there are the coenobites,[fn-9-P903_189083:605-nf] called in their Gentile language Sauses,[fn-9-P904_189178:606-nf] or, as we should say, men living in a community.[fn-9-P905_189292:607-nf] Secondly, there are the anchorites,[fn-9-P906_189356:608-nf] who live in the desert, each man by himself, and are so called because they have withdrawn from human society. Thirdly, there is the class called Remoboth,[fn-9-P907_189561:609-nf] a very inferior and little regarded type, peculiar to my own province,[fn-9-P908_190056:610-nf] or, at least, originating there. These live together in twos and threes, but seldom in larger numbers, and are bound by no rule; but do exactly as they choose. A portion of their earnings they contribute to a common fund, out of which food is provided for all. In most cases they reside in cities and strongholds; and, as though it were their workmanship which is holy, and not their life, all that they sell is extremely dear. They often quarrel because they are unwilling, while supplying their own food, to be subordinate to others. It is true that they compete with each other in fasting; they make what should be a private concern an occasion for a triumph. In everything they study effect: their sleeves are loose, their boots bulge, their garb is of the coarsest. They are always sighing, or visiting virgins, or sneering at the clergy; yet when a holiday comes, they make themselves sick-they eat so much.","index":"352","references":[{"fn":"9","code":"P903_189083","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"From koinoj bioj (koinos bios), a common life.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"9","code":"P904_189178","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Apparently an Egyptian word.

Having then rid ourselves of these as of so many plagues, let us come to that more numerous class who live together, and who are, as we have said, called Coenobites. Among these the first principle of union is to obey superiors and to do whatever they command. They are divided into bodies of ten and of a hundred, so that each tenth man has authority over nine others, while the hundredth has ten of these officers under him. They live apart from each other, in separate cells. According to their rule, no monk may visit another before the ninth hour;[fn-9-P910_191543:611-nf] except the deans[fn-9-P911_191587:612-nf] above mentioned, whose office is to comfort, with soothing words, those whose thoughts disquiet them. After the ninth hour they meet together to sing psalms and read the Scriptures according to usage. Then when the prayers have ended and all have sat down, one called the father stands up among them and begins to expound the portion of the day. While he is speaking the silence is profound; no man ventures to look at his neighbor or to clear his throat. The speaker's praise is in the weeping of his hearers.[fn-9-P912_192132:613-nf] Silent tears roll down their cheeks, but not a sob escapes from their lips. Yet when he begins to speak of Christ's kingdom, and of future bliss, and of the glory which is to come, every one may be noticed saying to himself, with a gentle sigh and uplifted eyes: \"Oh, that I had wings like a dove! For then would I fly away and be at rest.\"[fn-9-P913_192497:614-nf] After this the meeting breaks up and each company of ten goes with its father to its own table. This they take in turns to serve each for a week at a time. No noise is made over the food; no one talks while eating. Bread, pulse and greens form their fare, and the only seasoning that they use is salt. Wine is given only to the old, who with the children often have a special meal prepared for them to repair the ravages of age and to save the young from premature decay. When the meal is over they all rise together, and, after singing a hymn, return to their dwellings. There each one talks till evening with his comrade thus: \"Have you noticed so-and-so? What grace he has How silent he is! How soberly he walks!\" If any one is weak they comfort him; or if he is fervent in love to God, they encourage him to fresh earnestness. And because at night, besides the public prayers, each man keeps vigil in his own chamber, they go round all the cells one by one, and putting their ears to the doors, carefully ascertain what their occupants are doing. If they find a monk slothful, they do not scold him; but, dissembling what they know, they visit him more frequently, and at first exhort rather than compel him to pray more. Each day has its allotted task, and this being given in to the dean, is by him brought to the steward. This latter, once a month, gives a scrupulous account to their common father. He also tastes the dishes when they are cooked, and, as no one is allowed to say, \"I am without a tunic or a cloak or a couch of rushes,\" he so arranges that no one need ask for or go without what he wants. In case a monk falls ill, he is moved to a more spacious chamber, and there so attentively nursed by the old men, that he misses neither the luxury of cities nor a mother's kindness. Every Lord's day they spend their whole time in prayer and reading; indeed, when they have finished their tasks, these are their usual occupations. Every day they learn by heart a portion of Scripture. They keep the same fasts all the year round, but in Lent they are allowed to live more strictly. After Whitsuntide they exchange their evening meal for a midday one; both to satisfy the tradition of the church and to avoid overloading their stomachs with a double supply of food.","index":"353","references":[{"fn":"9","code":"P910_191543","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"I.e. three o'clock.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"9","code":"P911_191587","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Decani, \"leaders of ten.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"9","code":"P912_192132","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Cf.

He asks her to remember that Blaesilla is now in paradise, and so far to control herself as to prevent enemies of the faith from cavilling at her conduct. Then he concludes with the prophecy (since more than fulfilled) that in his writings Blaesilla's name shall never die.

For her sake I do not grieve, but for myself I must; my loss is too great to be borne with resignation. Who can recall with dry eyes the glowing faith which induced a girl of twenty to raise the standard of the Cross, and to mourn the loss of her virginity more than the death of her husband? Who can recall without a sigh the earnestness of her prayers, the brilliancy of her conversation, the tenacity of her memory, and the quickness of her intellect? Had you heard her speak Greek you would have deemed her ignorant of Latin; yet when she used the tongue of Rome her words were free from a foreign accent. She even rivalled the great Origen in those acquirements which won for him the admiration of Greece. For in a few months, or rather days, she so completely mastered the difficulties of Hebrew as to emulate her mother's zeal in learning and singing the psalms. Her attire was plain, but this plainness was not, as it often is, a mark of pride. Indeed, her self-abasement was so perfect that she dressed no better than her maids, and was only distinguished from them by the greater ease of her walk. Her steps tottered with weakness, her face was pale and quivering, her slender neck scarcely upheld her head. Still she always had in her hand a prophet or a gospel. As I think of her my eyes fill with tears, sobs impede my voice, and such is my emotion that my tongue cleaves to the roof of my mouth. As she lay there dying, her poor frame parched with burning fever, and her relatives gathered round her bed, her last words were: \"Pray to the Lord Jesus, that He may pardon me, because what I would have done I have not been able to do.\" Be at peace, dear Blaesilla, in full assurance that your garments are always white.[fn-11-P1190_253506:790-nf] For yours is the purity of an everlasting virginity. I feel confident that my words are true: conversion can never be too late. The words to the dying robber are a pledge of this: \"Verily I say unto thee, today shall thou be with me in paradise.\"[fn-11-P1191_253775:791-nf] When at last her spirit was delivered from the burden of the flesh, and had returned to Him who gave it;[fn-11-P1192_253903:792-nf] when, too, after her long pilgrimage, she had ascended up into her ancient heritage, her obsequies were celebrated with customary splendor.

Dear Paula, my agony is as great as yours. Jesus knows it, whom Blaesilla now follows; the holy angels know it, whose company she now enjoys. I was her father in the spirit, her foster-father in affection.

How comes it, I ask, that godless men live to old age in the enjoyment of this world's riches? How comes it that untutored youth and innocent childhood are cut down while still in the bud? Why is it that children three years old or two, and even unweaned infants, are possessed with devils, covered with leprosy, and eaten up with jaundice, while godless men and profane, adulterers and murderers, have health and strength to blaspheme God? Are we not told that the unrighteousness of the father does not fall upon the son,[fn-12-P1200_256337:799-nf] and that \"the soul that sinneth it shall die?\"[fn-12-P1201_256408:800-nf] Or if the old doctrine holds good that the sins of the fathers must be visited upon the children,[fn-12-P1202_256529:801-nf] an old man's countless sins cannot fairly be avenged upon a harmless infant. And I have said: \"Verily, I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency. For all the day long have I been plagued.\"[fn-12-P1203_256761:802-nf] Yet when I have thought of these things, like the prophet I have learned to say: \"When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me; until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.\"[fn-12-P1204_257008:803-nf] Truly the judgments of the Lord are a great deep.[fn-12-P1205_257097:804-nf] \"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!

Therefore we should congratulate our dear Blaesilla that she has passed from darkness to light,[fn-12-P1221_260807:818-nf] and has in the first flush of her dawning faith received the crown of her completed work. Had she been cut off (as f pray that none may be) while her thoughts were full of worldly desires and passing pleasures, then mourning would indeed have been her due, and no tears shed for her would have been too many. As it is, by the mercy of Christ she, four months ago, renewed her baptism in her vow of widowhood, and for the rest of her days spurned the world, and thought only of the religions life. Have you no fear, then, lest the Saviour may say to you: \"Are you angry, Paula, that your daughter has become my daughter? Are you vexed at my decree, and do you, with rebellious tears, grudge me the possession of Blaesilla? You ought to know what my purpose is both for you and for yours. You deny yourself food, not to fast but to gratify your grief; and such abstinence is displeasing to me. Such fasts are my enemies. I receive no soul which forsakes the body against my will.

The answer to your reasoning issimple. Jacob, it is true, mourned for Joseph, whom he fancied slain, and thought tomeet only in the grave (his words were: \"I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning\"), but he only did so because Christ had not yet broken open the door of paradise, nor quenched with his blood the flaming sword and the whirling of the guardian cherubim.[fn-12-P1234_264466:830-nf] (Hence in the story of Dives and Lazarus, Abraham and the beggar, though really in a place of refreshment, are described as being in hell.[fn-12-P1235_264876:831-nf] ) And David, who, after interceding in vain for the life of his infant child, refused to weep for it, knowing that it had not sinned, did well to weep for a son who had been a parricide-in will, if not in deed.[fn-12-P1236_265121:832-nf] And when we read that, for Moses and Aaron, lamentation was made after ancient custom, this ought not to surprise us, for even in the Acts of the Apostles, in the full blaze of the gospel, we see that the brethren at Jerusalem made great lamentation for Stephen.[fn-12-P1237_265409:833-nf] This great lamentation, however, refers not to the mourners, but to the funeral procession and to the crowds which accompanied it. This is what the Scripture says of Jacob: \"Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, and all the house of Joseph and his brethren\"; and a few lines farther on: \"And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a great company.\" Finally, \"they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation.\"[fn-12-P1238_265980:834-nf] This solemn lamentation does not impose prolonged weeping upon the Egyptians, but simply describes the funeral ceremony. In like manner, when we read of weeping made for Moses and Aaron,[fn-12-P1239_266188:835-nf] this is all that is meant.","index":"441","references":[{"fn":"12","code":"P1230_263754","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Gen. xxxvii. 35.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":37,"verses":[35]}]},{"fn":"12","code":"P1231_263929","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"2 Sam. xviii. 33.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 samuel","chapter":18,"verses":[33]}]},{"fn":"12","code":"P1232_263961","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Deut. xxxiv. 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"deuteronomy","chapter":34,"verses":[8]}]},{"fn":"12","code":"P1233_264000","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Nu. xx. 29.","bible_refs":[{"book":"numbers","chapter":20,"verses":[29]}]},{"fn":"12","code":"P1234_264466","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Gen. iii. 24: cf.

And to make their superstition complete, they follow a foolish custom of the Pharisees, and eat lentils,[fn-12-P1245_267341:840-nf] to show, it would seem, for what poor fare they have lost their birthright.[fn-12-P1246_267571:841-nf] Of course they are right to weep, for as they do not believe in the Lord's resurrection they are being made ready for the advent of antichrist. But we who have put on Christ[fn-12-P1247_267766:842-nf] and according to the apostle are a royal and priestly race,[fn-12-P1248_267847:843-nf] we ought not to grieve for the dead. \"Moses,\" the Scripture tells us, \"said unto Aaron and unto Eleazar, and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left: Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people.\"[fn-12-P1249_268122:844-nf] Rend not your clothes, he says, neither mourn as pagans, lest you die. For, for us sin is death. In this same book, Leviticus, there is a provision which may perhaps strike some as cruel, yet is necessary to faith: the high priest is forbidden to approach the dead bodies of his father and mother, of his brothers and of his children;[fn-12-P1250_268487:845-nf] to the end, that no grief may distract a soul engaged in offering sacrifice to God, and wholly devoted to the Divine mysteries. Are we not taught the same lesson in theGospel in other words? Is not the disciple forbidden to say farewell to his home or to bury his dead father?[fn-12-P1251_268788:846-nf] Of the high priest, again, it is said: \"He shall not go out of the sanctuary, and the sanctification of his God shall not be contaminated, for the anointing oil of his God is upon him.\"[fn-12-P1252_268997:847-nf] Certainly, now that we have believed in Christ, and bear Him within us, by reason of the oil of His anointing which we have received,[fn-12-P1253_269158:848-nf] we ought not to depart from His temple-that is, from our Christian profession-we ought not to go forth to mingle with the unbelieving Gentiles, but always to remain within, as servants obedient to the will of the Lord.","index":"442","references":[{"fn":"12","code":"P1241_266494","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Josh. xxiv. 30.","bible_refs":[{"book":"joshua","chapter":24,"verses":[30]}]},{"fn":"12","code":"P1242_266715","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Ad inferos.

I have spoken plainly, lest you might ignorantly suppose that Scripture sanctions your grief; and that, if you err, you have reason on your side. And, so far, my words have been addressed to the average Christian woman. But now it will not be so. For in your case, as I well know, renunciation of the world has been complete; you have rejected and trampled on the delights of life, and you give yourself daily to fasting, to reading, and to prayer. Like Abraham,[fn-12-P1255_269864:849-nf] you desire to leave your country and kindred, to forsake Mesopotamia and the Chaldaeans, to enter into the promised land. Dead to the world before your death, you have spent all your mere worldly substance upon the poor, or have bestowed it upon your children. I am the more surprised, therefore, that you should act in a manner which in others would justly call for reprehension. You call to mind Blaesilla's companionship, her conversation, and her endearing ways; and you cannot endure the thought that you have lost them all. I pardon you the tears of a mother, but I ask you to restrain your grief. When I think of the parent I cannot blame you for weeping: but when I think of the Christian and the recluse, the mother disappears from my view. Your wound is still fresh, and ant touch of mine, however gentle, is more likely to inflame than to heal it. Yet why do you not try to overcome by reason a grief which time must inevitably assuage? Naomi, fleeing because of famine to the land of Moab, there lost her husband and her sons. Yet when she was thus deprived of her natural protectors, Ruth, a stranger, never left her side.[fn-12-P1256_271023:850-nf] And see what a great thing it is to comfort a lonely woman Ruth, for her reward, is made an ancestress of Christ.[fn-12-P1257_271152:851-nf] Consider the great trials which Job endured, and you will see that you are over-delicate. Amid the ruins of his house, the pains of his sores, his countless bereavements, and, last of all, the snares laid for him by his wife, he still lifted up his eyes to heaven, and maintained his patience unbroken. I know what you are going to say \"All this befell him as a righteous man, to try his righteousness.\" Well, choose which alternative you please. Either you are holy, in which case God is putting your holiness to the proof; or else you are a sinner, in which case you have no right to complain.

The sequel seems incredible, but Christ is my witness that my words are true. Would you not suppose that in her frenzy she would have unbound her hair, and rent her clothes, and torn her breast? Yet not a tear fell from her eyes.

When you were carried fainting out of the funeral procession, whispers such as these were audible in the crowd. \"Is not this what we have often said. She weeps for her daughter, killed with fasting.

Yet they were wicked husbandmen, they had slain the prophets, they were then compassing the death of the Lord;[fn-13-P1324_290345:893-nf] and so utterly lost were they that the Son of God told them that it was they whom he had come to save.[fn-13-P1325_290470:894-nf] It must be proved to Novatian, therefore, that the sin which shall never be forgiven is not the blasphemy of men disembowelled by torture who in their agony deny their Lord, but is the captious clamor of those who, while they see that God's works are the fruit of virtue, ascribe the virtue to a demon and declare the signs wrought to belong not to the divine excellence but to the devil. And this is the whole gist of our Saviour's argument, when He teaches that Satan cannot be cast out by Satan, and that his kingdom is not divided against itself.[fn-13-P1326_291045:895-nf] If it is the devil's object to injure God's creation, how can he wish to cure the sick and to expel himself from the bodies possessed by him?

But to put a more searching question still: let Novatian tell us how he distinguishes speaking against the Son of Man from blasphemy against the Holy Ghost. For I maintain that on his principles men who have denied Christ under persecution have only spoken against the Son of Man, and have not blasphemed the Holy Ghost. For when a man is asked if he is a Christian, and declares that he is not; obviously in denying Christ, that is the Son of Man, he does no despite to the Holy Ghost. But if his denial of Christ involves a denial of the Holy Ghost, this heretic can perhaps tell us how the Son of Man can be denied without sinning against the Holy Ghost. If he thinks that we are here intended by the term Holy Ghost to understand the Father, no mention at all of the Father is made by the denier in his denial. When the apostle Peter, taken aback by a maid's question, denied the Lord, did he sin against the Son of Man or against the Holy Ghost? If Novatian absurdly twists Peter's words, \"I know not the man,\"[fn-13-P1330_292681:898-nf] to mean a denial not of Christ's Messiahship but of His humanity, he will make the Saviour a liar, for He foretold[fn-13-P1331_292819:899-nf] that He Himself, that is His divine Sonship, must be denied. Now, when Peter denied the Son of God, he wept bitterly and effaced his threefold denial by a threefold confession.[fn-13-P1332_293037:900-nf] His sin, therefore, was not the sin against the Holy Ghost which can never be forgiven. It is obvious, then, that this sin involves blasphemy, calling one Beelzebub for his actions, whose virtues prove him to be God. If Novatian can bring an instance of a renegade who has called Christ Beelzebub, I will at once give up my position and admit that after such a fall the denier can win no forgiveness. To give way under torture and to deny oneself to be a Christian is one thing, to say that Christ is the devil is another.

How, then, you will say, do we read in the apocalypse written by John: \"The beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall ...kill them [that is, obviously, the prophets], and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified?\"[fn-14-P1445_319709:976-nf] If the great city where the Lord was crucified is Jerusalem, and if the place of His crucifixion is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt; then as the Lord was crucified at Jerusalem, Jerusalem must be Sodom and Egypt. Holy Scripture, I reply first of all, cannot contradict itself. One book cannot invalidate the drift of the whole. A single verse cannot annul the meaning of a book. Ten lines earlier in the apocalypse it is written: \"Rise and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein. But the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles; and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.\"[fn-14-P1446_320437:977-nf] The apocalypse was written by John long after the Lord's passion, yet in it he speaks of Jerusalem as the holy city. But if so, how can he spiritually call it Sodom and Egypt? It is no answer to say that the Jerusalem which is called holy is the heavenly one which is to be, while that which is called Sodom is the earthly one tottering to its downfall. For it is the Jerusalem to come that is referred to in the description of the beast, \"which shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and shall make war against the two prophets, and shall overcome them and kill them, and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city.\"[fn-14-P1447_321092:978-nf] At the close of the book it is farther described thus: \"And the city lieth four-square, and the length of it and the breadth are the same as the height; and he measured the city with the golden reed twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal. And he measured the walls thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel. And the building of the wall of it was of jasper; and the city was pure gold\"[fn-14-P1448_321616:979-nf] -and so on. Now where there is a square there can be neither length nor breadth.

Evidently this description cannot be taken literally (in fact, it is absurd to suppose a city the length, breadth and height of which are all twelve thousand furlongs), and therefore the details of it must be mystically understood. The great city which Cain first built and called after his son[fn-14-P1450_322272:980-nf] must be taken to represent this world, which the devil, that accuser of his brethren, that fratricide who is doomed to perish, has built of vice cemented with crime, and filled with iniquity. Therefore it is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt. Thus it is written, \"Sodom shall return to her former estate,\"[fn-14-P1451_322599:981-nf] that is to say, the world must be restored as it has been before. For we cannot believe that Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboim[fn-14-P1452_322751:982-nf] are to be built again: they must be left to lie in ashes forever. We never read of Egypt as put for Jerusalem: it always stands for this world. To collect from Scripture the countless proofs of this would be tedious: I shall adduce but one passage, a passage in which this world is most clearly called Egypt. The apostle Jude, the brother of James, writes thus in his catholic epistle: \"I will, therefore, put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this how that Jesus,[fn-14-P1453_323245:983-nf] having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.\"[fn-14-P1454_323364:984-nf] And, lest you should fancy Joshua the son of Nun to be meant, the passage goes on thus: \"And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains, under darkness, unto the judgment of the great day.\"[fn-14-P1455_323642:985-nf] Moreover, to convince you that in every place where Egypt, Sodom and Gomorrah are named together it is not these spots, but the present world, which is meant, he mentions them immediately in this sense. \"Even as Sodom and Gomorrah,\" he writes, \"and the cities about them, in like manner giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.\"[fn-14-P1456_324085:986-nf] But what need is there to collect more proofs when, after the passion and the resurrection of the Lord, the evangelist Matthew tells us: \"The rocks rent, and the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city and appeared unto many\"?[fn-14-P1457_324434:987-nf] We must not interpret this passage straight off, as many people[fn-14-P1458_324539:988-nf] absurdly do, of the heavenly Jerusalem: the apparition there of the bodies of the saints could be no sign to men of the Lord's rising. Since, therefore, the evangelists and all the Scriptures speak of Jerusalem as the holy city, and since the psalmist commands us to worship the Lord \"at his footstool;\"[fn-14-P1459_324896:989-nf] allow no one to call it Sodom and Egypt, for by it the Lord forbids men to swear because\"it is the city of the great king.\"[fn-14-P1460_325042:990-nf] ","index":"500","references":[{"fn":"14","code":"P1450_322272","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Gen. iv. 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":4,"verses":[17]}]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1451_322599","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Ezek. xvi. 55.","bible_refs":[{"book":"ezekiel","chapter":16,"verses":[55]}]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1452_322751","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Deut. xxix. 23.","bible_refs":[{"book":"deuteronomy","chapter":29,"verses":[23]}]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1453_323245","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"A.V. \"the Lord.\"","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1454_323364","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Jude 5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"jude","chapter":1,"verses":[5]}]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1455_323642","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Jude 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"jude","chapter":1,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1456_324085","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Jude 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"jude","chapter":1,"verses":[7]}]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1457_324434","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Matt. xxvii. 51, Matt. xxvii. 53.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":27,"verses":[51]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":27,"verses":[53]}]},{"fn":"14","code":"P1458_324539","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"E.g.

Certain persons find fault with me because in the books which I have written against Jovinian I have been excessive (so they say) in praise of virginity and in depreciation of marriage; and they affirm that to preach up chastity till no comparison is left between a wife and a virgin is equivalent to a condemnation of matrimony. If I remember aright the point of the dispute, the question at issue between myself and Jovinian is that he puts marriage on a level with virginity, while I make it inferior; he declares that there is little or no difference between the two states, I assert that there is a great deal. Finally-a result due under God to your agency-he has been condemned because he has dared to set matrimony on an equality with perpetual chastity. Or, if a virgin and a wife are to be looked on as the same, how comes it that Rome has refused to listen to this impious doctrine? A virgin owes her being to a man, but a man does not owe his to a virgin. There can be no middle course. Either my view of the matter must be embraced, or else that of Jovinian. If I am blamed for putting wedlock below virginity, he must be praised for putting the two states on a level. If, on the other hand, he is condemned for supposing them equal, his condemnation must be taken as testimony in favor of my treatise. If men of the world chafe under the notion that they occupy a position inferior to that of virgins, I wonder that clergymen and monks-who both live celibate lives-refrain from praising what they consistently practise. They cut themselves off from their wives to imitate the chastity of virgins, and yet they will have it that married women are as good as these. They should either be joined again to their wives whom they have renounced, or, if they persist in living apart from them, they will have to confess-by their lives if not by their words-that, in preferring virginity to marriage, they have chosen the better course, Am I then a mere novice in the Scriptures, reading the sacred volumes for the first time? And is the line there drawn between virginity and marriage so fine that I have been unable to observe it? I could know nothing, forsooth, of the saying, \"Be not righteous overmuch!\"[fn-15-P1526_344276:1038-nf] Thus, while I try to protect myself on one side, I am wounded on the other; to speak more plainly still, while I close with Jovinian in hand-to-hand combat, Manichaeus stabs me in the back. Have I not, I would ask, in the very forefront of my work set the following preface:[fn-15-P1527_344595:1039-nf] \"We are no disciples of Marcion[fn-15-P1528_344655:1040-nf] or of Manichaeus,[fn-15-P1529_344756:1041-nf] to detract from marriage. Nor are we deceived by the error of Tatian,[fn-15-P1530_344947:1042-nf] the chief of the Encratites,[fn-15-P1531_345104:1043-nf] into supposing all cohabitation unclean. For he condemns and reprobates not marriage only, but foods also which God has created for us to enjoy.[fn-15-P1532_345339:1044-nf] We know that in a large house there are vessels not only of silver and of gold, but of wood also and of earth.[fn-15-P1533_345473:1045-nf] We know, too, that on the foundation of Christ which Paul the master builder has laid, some build up gold, silver, and precious stones; others, on the contrary, hay, wood, and stubble.[fn-15-P1534_345682:1046-nf] We are not ignorant that `marriage is honorable ...and the bed undefiled.'[fn-15-P1535_345783:1047-nf] We have read the first decree of God: `Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth.'[fn-15-P1536_345896:1048-nf] But while we allow marriage, we prefer the virginity which springs from it. Gold is more precious than silver, but is silver on that account the less silver? Is it an insult to a tree to prefer its apples to its roots or its leaves? Is it an injury to corn to put the ear before the stalk and the blade? As apples come from the tree and grain from the straw, so virginity comes from wedlock. Yields of one hundredfold, of sixtyfold, and of thirtyfold[fn-15-P1537_346368:1049-nf] may all come from one soil and from one sowing, yet they will differ widely in quantity. The yield thirtyfold signifies wedlock, for the joining together of the fingers to express that number, suggestive as it is of a loving gentle kiss or embracing, aptly represents the relation of husband and wife. The yield sixtyfold refers to widows who are placed in a position of distress and tribulation. Accordingly, they are typified by that finger which is placed under the other to express the number sixty; for, as it is extremely trying when one has once tasted pleasure to abstain from its enticements, so the reward of doing this is proportionately great. Moreover, a hundred-I ask the reader to give me his best attention-necessitates a change from the left hand to the right; but while the hand is different the fingers are the same as those which on the left hand signify married women and widows; only in this instance the circle formed by them indicates the crown of virginity.\"[fn-15-P1538_347376:1050-nf] ","index":"516","references":[{"fn":"15","code":"P1526_344276","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Eccl. vii. 16: see Ag.

As the brief compass of a letter does not suffer us to delay too long on a single point, let us now pass to those which remain. In explaining the testimony of the apostle, \"The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband; and likewise, also, the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife,\"[fn-15-P1544_349566:1054-nf] we have subjoined the following:[fn-15-P1545_349623:1055-nf] \"The entire question relates to those who are living in wedlock, whether it is lawful for them to put away their wives, a thing which the Lord also has forbidden in the Gospel.[fn-15-P1546_349824:1056-nf] Hence, also, the apostle says: `It is good for a man not to touch' a wife or `a woman,'[fn-15-P1547_349935:1057-nf] as if there were danger in the contact which he who should so touch one could not escape. Accordingly, when the Egyptian woman desired to touch Joseph he flung away his cloak and fled from her hands.[fn-15-P1548_350159:1058-nf] But as he who has once married a wife cannot, except by consent, abstain from intercourse with her or repudiate her, so long as she does not sin, he must render unto his wife her due,[fn-15-P1549_350384:1059-nf] because he has of his own free will bound himself to render it under compulsion.\" Can one who declares that it is a precept of the Lord that wives should not be put away, and that what God has joined together man must not, without consent, put asunder[fn-15-P1550_350665:1060-nf] -can such an one be said to condemn marriage? Again, in the verses which follow, the apostle says: \"But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.\"[fn-15-P1551_350879:1061-nf] In explanation of this saying we made the following remarks:[fn-15-P1552_350964:1062-nf] \"What I myself would wish, he says, is clear. But since there are diversities of gifts in the church,[fn-15-P1553_351090:1063-nf] I allow marriage as well, that I may not appear to condemn nature. Reflect, too, that the gift of virginity is one thing, that of marriage another. For had there been one reward for married women and for virgins he would never, after giving the counsel of continence, have gone on to say: `But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner and another after that.' Where each class has its proper gift, there must be some distinction between the classes. I allow that marriage, as well as virginity, is the gift of God, but there is a great difference between gift and gift. Finally, the apostle himself says of one who had lived in incest and afterwards repented: `Contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him and comfort him,'[fn-15-P1554_351857:1064-nf] and `To whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also.'[fn-15-P1555_351931:1065-nf] And, lest we might suppose a man's gift to be but a small thing, he has added: `For if I forgave anything, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the sight[fn-15-P1556_352125:1066-nf] of Christ.'[fn-15-P1557_352157:1067-nf] The gifts of Christ are different.

I ask, then, what is the meaning of men's obstinate determination to shut their eyes and to refuse to look on what is as clear as day? I have said that there are diversities of gifts in the Church, and that virginity is one gift and wedlock another. And shortly after I have used the words: \"I allow marriage also to be a gift of God, but there is a great difference between gift and gift.\" Can it be said that I condemn that which in the clearest terms I declare to be the gift of God? Moreover, if Joseph is taken as a type of the Lord, his coat of many colors is a type of virgins and widows, celibates and wedded. Can any one who has any part in Christ's tunic be regarded as an alien?

Once more, in another place, we have brought forward the testimony of the apostle to this effect: \"Art thou bound unto a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.\"[fn-15-P1578_358062:1085-nf] To this we have appended the following remarks:[fn-15-P1579_358135:1086-nf] \"Each of us has his own sphere allotted to him.

In the sequel we go on to Speak thus:[fn-15-P1586_359893:1092-nf] \"The apostle, in concluding his discussion of marriage and of virginity, is careful to observe a mean course in discriminating between them, and, turning neither to the right hand nor to the left, he keeps to the King's highway,[fn-15-P1587_360147:1093-nf] and thus fulfils the injunction, `Be not righteous overmuch.'[fn-15-P1588_360230:1094-nf] Moreover, when he goes on to compare monogamy with digamy, he puts digamy after monogamy, just as before he subordinated marriage to virginity.\" Do we not clearly show by this language what is typified in the Holy Scriptures by the terms right and left, and also what we take to be the meaning of the words \"Be not righteous overmuch\"? We turn to the left if, following the lust of Jews and Gentiles, we burn for sexual intercourse; we turn to the right if, following the error of the Manichaeans, we under a pretence of chastity entangle ourselves in the meshes of unchastity. But we keep to the King's highway if we aspire to virginity yet refrain from condemning marriage. Can any one, moreover, be so unfair in his criticism of my poor treatise as to allege that I condemn first marriages, when he reads my opinion on second ones as follows:[fn-15-P1589_361102:1095-nf] \"The apostle, it is true, allows second marriages, but only to such women as are bent upon them, to such as cannot contain,[fn-15-P1590_361251:1096-nf] lest `when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ they marry, having condemnation because they have rejected their first faith,'[fn-15-P1591_361410:1097-nf] and he makes this concession because many `are turned aside after Satan.'[fn-15-P1592_361526:1098-nf] But they will be happier if they abide as widows. To this he immediately adds his apostolical authority, `after my judgment.' Moreover, lest any should consider that authority, being human, to be of small weight, he goes on to say, `and I think also that I have the spirit of God.'[fn-15-P1593_361831:1099-nf] Thus, where he urges men to continence he appeals not to human authority, but to the Spirit of God; but when he gives them permission to marry he does not mention the Spirit of God, but allows prudential considerations to turn the balance, relaxing the strictness of his code in favor of individuals according to their several needs.\" Having thus brought forward proofs that second marriages are allowed by the apostle, we at once added the remarks which follow:[fn-15-P1594_362319:1100-nf] \"As marriage is permitted to virgins by reason of the danger of fornication, and as what in itself is not desirable is thus made excusable, so by reason of the same danger widows are permitted to marry a second time. For it is better that a woman should know one man (though he should be a second husband or a third) than that she should know several. In other words, it is preferable that she should prostitute herself to one rather than to many.\" Calumny may do its worst. We have spoken here not of a first marriage, but of a second, of a third, or (if you like) of a fourth. But lest any one should apply my words (that it is better for a woman to prostitute herself to one man than to several) to a first marriage when my whole argument dealt with digamy and trigamy, I marked my own view of these practices with the words:[fn-15-P1595_363173:1101-nf] \"`All things are lawful, but all things are not expedient.'[fn-15-P1596_363258:1102-nf] I do not condemn digamists nor yet trigamists, nor even, to put an extreme, case, octogamists.

If married men feel indignant at this statement, let them vent their anger not on me but on the Holy Scriptures; nay, more, upon all bishops, presbyters, and deacons, and the whole company of priests and levites, who know that they cannot offer sacrifices if they fulfil the obligations of marriage.

In describing our Lord's visit to the marriage at Cana in Galilee,[fn-16-P1608_367638:1111-nf] after some other remarks I have added these:[fn-16-P1609_367716:1112-nf] \"He who went but once to a marriage has taught us that a woman should marry but once; and this fact might tell against virginity if we failed to give marriage its due place-after virginity that is, and chaste widowhood. But, as it is only heretics who condemn marriage and tread under foot the ordinance of God, we listen with gladness to every word said by our Lord in praise of marriage. For the Church does not condemn marriage, but only subordinates it. It does not reject it altogether, but regulates it, knowing (as I have said above) that `in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor and some to dishonor. If a man, therefore, purge himself ...he shall be a vessel unto honor meet ...and prepared unto every good work.'\"[fn-16-P1610_368537:1113-nf] I listen with gladness, I say here, to every word said by the apostle in praise of marriage. Do I listen with gladness to the praise of marriage, and do I yet condemn marriage? The Church, I say, does not condemn wedlock, but subordinates it. Whether you like it or not, marriage is subordinated to virginity and widowhood. Even when marriage continues to fulfil its function, the Church does not condemn it, but only subordinates it; it does not reject it, but only regulates it. It is in your power, if you will, to mount the second step of chastity.[fn-16-P1611_369129:1114-nf] Why are you angry if, standing on the third and lowest step, you will not make haste to go up higher?","index":"525","references":[{"fn":"16","code":"P1608_367638","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Joh. ii. 1, Joh. ii. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":2,"verses":[1]},{"book":"john","chapter":2,"verses":[2]}]},{"fn":"16","code":"P1609_367716","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Ag.

For who is so dull or so inexperienced in writing as to praise and to condemn one and the same object, as to destroy what he has built up, and to build up what he has destroyed; and when he has vanquished his opponent, to turn his sword, last of all against himself?

To direct the fighter how to fight when you yourself occupy a post of vantage on the wall is a kind of teaching that does not commend itself; and when you are yourself bathed in perfumes, it is unworthy to charge a bleeding soldier with cowardice. Nor in saying this do I lay myself open to a charge of boasting that while others have slept I only have entered the lists. My meaning simply is that men who have seen me wounded in this warfare may possibly be a little too cautious in their methods of fighting.

You are, no doubt, men of vast acquirements; but we too have studied in the schools, and, like you, we have learned from the precepts of Aristotle-or, rather, from those which he has derived from Gorgias-that there are different ways of speaking; and we know, among other things, that he who writes for display uses one style, and he who writes to convince, another.[fn-16-P1617_372175:1116-nf] In the former case the debate is desultory; to confute the opposer, now this argument is adduced and now that. One argues as one pleases, saying one thing while one means another. To quote the proverb, \"With one hand one offers bread, in the other one holds a stone.\"[fn-16-P1618_372586:1117-nf] In the latter case a certain frankness and openness of countenance are necessary. For it is one thing to start a problem and another to expound what is already proved. The first calls for a disputant, the second for a teacher. I stand in the thick of the fray, my life in constant danger: you who profess to teach me are a man of books. \"Do not,\" you say, \"attack unexpectedly or wound by a side-thrust. Strike straight at your opponent. You should be ashamed to resort to feints instead of force.\" As if it were not the perfection of fighting to menace one part and to strike another. Read, I beg of you, Demosthenes or Cicero, or (if you do not care for pleaders whose aim is to speak plausibly rather than truly) read Plato, Theophrastus, Xenophon, Aristotle, and the rest of those who draw their respective rills of wisdom from the Socratic fountain-head. Do they show any openness? Are they devoid of artifice? Is not every word they say filled with meaning? And does not this meaning always make for victory? Origen, Methodius, Eusebius, and Apollinaris[fn-16-P1619_373678:1118-nf] write at great length against Celsus and Porphyry.[fn-16-P1620_373874:1119-nf] Consider how subtle are the arguments, how insidious the engines with which they overthrow what the spirit of the devil has wrought. Sometimes, it is true, they are compelled to say not what they think but what is needful; and for this reason they employ against their opponents the assertions of the Gentiles themselves. I say nothing of the Latin authors, of Tertullian, Cyprian, Minutius, Victorinus, Lactantius, Hilary, lest I should appear not so much to be defending myself as to be assailing others. I will only mention the Apostle Paul, whose words seem to me, as often as I hear them, to be not words, but peals of thunder. Read his epistles, and especially those addressed to the Romans, to the Galatians, and to the Ephesians, in all of which he stands in the thick of the battle, and you will see how skilful and how careful he is in the proofs which he draws from the Old Testament, and how warily he cloaks the object which he has in view. His words seem simplicity itself: the expressions of a guileless and unsophisticated person-one who has no skill either to plan a dilemma or to avoid it. Still, whichever way you look, they are thunderbolts. His pleading halts, yet he carries every point which he takes up. He turns his back upon his foe only to overcome him; he simulates flight, but only that he may slay. He, then, if any one, ought to be calumniated; we should speak thus to him: \"The proofs which yon have used against the Jews or against other heretics bear a different meaning in their own contexts to that which they bear in your epistles. We see passages taken captive by your pen and pressed into service to win you a victory which in the volumes from which they are taken have no controversial bearing at all.\" May he not reply to us in the words of the Saviour: \"I have one mode of speech for those that are without and another for those that are within; the crowds hear my parables, but their interpretation is for my disciples alone\"?[fn-16-P1621_375982:1120-nf] The Lord puts questions to the Pharisees, but does not elucidate them.

I might use such language had the desire of victory induced me to say anything counter to the rule laid down in Scripture, and had I taken the line-so often adopted by strong men in controversy-of justifying the means by the result.

Anything, therefore, which seems a hard saying should be imputed to the writer expounded by me rather than to me the expounder; unless, indeed, he spoke otherwise than he is represented to have done, and I have by an unfair interpretation wrested the plain meaning of his words.

But if any one thinks it hard or reprehensible that I have placed the same interval between virginity and wedlock as there is between fine corn and barley, let him read the book of the holy Ambrose \"On Widows,\" and he will find, among other statements concerning virginity and marriage, the following:[fn-16-P1642_382084:1137-nf] \"The apostle has not expressed his preference for marriage so unreservedly as to quench in men the aspiration after virginity; he commences with a recommendation of continence, and it is only subsequently that he stoops to mention the remedies for its opposite.

For he had himself learned that the Lord Jesus gave to some barley bread, lest they should faint by the way, but offered to others His own body, that they should strive to attain His kingdom;\"[fn-16-P1645_382859:1140-nf] and immediately afterwards: \"The nuptial tie, then, is not to be avoided as a crime, but to be refused as a hard burden. For the law binds the wife to bring forth children in labor and in sorrow. Her desire is to be to her husband that he should rule over her.[fn-16-P1646_383161:1141-nf] It is not the widow, then, but the bride, who is handed over to labor and sorrow in childbearing. It is not the virgin, but the married woman, who is subjected to the sway of a husband.\" And in another place, \"Ye are bought,\" says the apostle, \"with a price;[fn-16-P1647_383443:1142-nf] be not therefore the servants of men.\"[fn-16-P1648_383522:1143-nf] You see how clearly he defines the servitude which attends the married state. And a little farther on: \"If, then, even a good marriage is servitude, what must a bad one be, in which husband and wife cannot sanctify, but only mutually destroy each other?\" What I have said about virginity and marriage diffusely, Ambrose has stated tersely and pointedly, compressing much meaning into a few words. Virginity is described by him as a means of recommending continence, marriage as a remedy for incontinence. And when he descends from broad principles to particular details, he significantly holds out to virgins the prize of the high calling, yet comforts the married, that they may not faint by the way. While eulogizing the one class, he does not despise the other. Marriage he compares to the barley bread set before the multitude, virginity to the body of Christ given to the disciples. There is much less difference, it seems to me, between barley and fine corn than between barley and the body of Christ. Finally, he speaks of marriage as a hard burden, to be avoided if possible, and as a badge of the most unmistakable servitude. He makes, also, many other statements, which he has followed up at length in his three books \"On Virgins.\"","index":"533","references":[{"fn":"16","code":"P1636_380868","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Ag.

What a noble indulgence the words convey! One which he blushes to speak of in plainer words, which he prefers only to Satan's temptation, and which has its root in incontinence. Do we labor to expound this as a dark saying when the writer has himself explained his meaning? \"I speak this,\" he says, `by way of permission, and not as a command.'[fn-16-P1668_390783:1160-nf] Do we still hesitate to speak of wedlock as a thing permitted instead of as a thing enjoined? or are we afraid that such permission will exclude second or third marriages or some other case?' What have I said here which the apostle has not said? The phrase, I suppose, \"which he blushes to speak of in plainer words.\" I imagine that when he says \"come together,\" and does not mention for what, he takes a modest way of indicating what he does not like to name openly-that is, sexual intercourse. Or is the objection to the words which follow-\"which he prefers only to Satan's temptation, and which has its root in incontinence\"? Are they not the very words of the apostle, only differently arranged-\"that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency\"? Or do people cavil because I said, \"Do we still hesitate to speak of wedlock as a thing permitted instead of as a thing enjoined?\" If this seems a hard saying, it should be ascribed to the apostle, who says, \"But I speak this by way of permission, and not as a command,\" and not to me, who, except that I have rearranged their order, have changed neither the words nor their meaning.","index":"536","references":[{"fn":"16","code":"P1666_390035","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Against Jov. i. 8.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"16","code":"P1667_390387","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1 Cor. vii. 5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":7,"verses":[5]}]},{"fn":"16","code":"P1668_390783","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1 Cor. vii. 6, Vulg.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":7,"verses":[6]}]}]},{"text":"17. The shortness of a letter compels me to hasten on. I pass, accordingly, to the points which remain. \"I say,\" remarks the apostle, \"to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I. But if they cannot contain, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn.\"[fn-16-P1670_392239:1161-nf] This section I have interpreted thus:[fn-16-P1671_392316:1162-nf] \"When he has granted to those who are married the use of wedlock, and has made clear his own wishes and concessions, he passes on to those who are unmarried or widows, and sets before them his own example. He calls them happy if they abide even as he,[fn-16-P1672_392592:1163-nf] but he goes on, `if they cannot contain, let them marry.' He thus repeats his former language, `but only to avoid fornication,' and `that Satan tempt you not for your incontinence.' And when he says, `If they cannot contain, let them marry,' he gives as a reason for his words that `it is better to marry than to burn.' It is only good to marry, because it is bad to burn. But take away the fire of lust, and he will not say `it is better to marry.' For a thing is said to be better in antithesis to something which is worse, and not simply in contrast with what is admittedly good. It is as though he said, `It is better to have one eye than none.'\" Shortly afterwards, apostrophizing the apostle, I spoke thus:[fn-16-P1673_393329:1164-nf] \"If marriage is good in itself, do not compare it with a conflagration, but simply say, `It is good to marry.' I must suspect the goodness of a thing which only becomes a lesser evil in the presence of a greater one. I, for my part, would have it not a lighter evil but a downright good.\" The apostle wishes unmarried women and widows to abstain from sexual intercourse, incites them to follow his own example, and calls them happy if they abide even as he. But if they cannot contain, and are tempted to quench the fire of lust by fornication rather than by continence, it is better, he tells them, to marry than to burn. Upon which precept I have made this comment: \"It is good to marry, simply because it is bad to burn,\" not putting forward a view of my own, but only explaining the apostle's precept, \"It is better to marry than to burn;\" that is, it is better to take a husband than to commit fornication. If, then, you teach that burning or fornication is good, the good will still be surpassed by what is still better.[fn-16-P1674_394380:1165-nf] But if marriage is only a degree better than the evil to which it is preferred, it cannot be of that unblemished perfection and blessedness which suggest a comparison with the life of angels. Suppose I say, \"It is better to be a virgin than a married woman;\" in this case I have preferred to what is good what is still better. But suppose I go a step further and say, \"It is better to marry than to commit fornication;\" in that case I have preferred, not a better thing to a good thing, but a good thing to a bad one. There is a wide difference between the two cases; for, while virginity is related to marriage as better is to good, marriage is related to fornication as good is to bad. How, I should like to know, have I sinned in this explanation? My fixed purpose was not to bend the Scriptures to my own wishes, but simply to say what I took to be their meaning. A commentator has no business to dilate on his own views; his duty is to make plain the meaning of the author whom he professes to interpret. For, if he contradicts the writer whom he is trying to expound, he will prove to be his opponent rather than his interpreter. When I am freely expressing my own opinion, and not commenting upon the Scriptures, then any one that pleases may charge me with having spoken hardly of marriage. But if he can find no ground for such a charge, he should attribute such passages in my commentaries as appear severe or harsh to the author commented on, and not to me, who am only his interpreter.","index":"537","references":[{"fn":"16","code":"P1670_392239","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1 Cor. vii. 8, 1 Cor. vii. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":7,"verses":[8]}]},{"fn":"16","code":"P1671_392316","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Ag.

Whilst Damasus of holy memory was still living, I wrote a book against Helvidius \"On the Perpetual Virginity of the Blessed Mary,\" in which, duly to extol the bliss of virginity, I was forced to say much of the troubles of marriage. Did that excellent man-versed in Scripture as he was, and a virgin doctor of the virgin Church-find anything to censure in my discourse? Moreover, in the treatise which I addressed to Eustochium[fn-16-P1678_397115:1168-nf] I used much harsher language regarding marriage, and yet no one was offended at it. Nay, every lover of chastity strained his ears to catch my eulogy of continence. Read Tertullian, read Cyprian, read Ambrose, and either accuse me with them or acquit me with them. My critics resemble the characters of Plautus. Their only wit lies in detraction; and they try to make themselves out men of learning by assailing all parties in turn.

It surely becomes us, dearly beloved, not to abuse our rank as clergy, so as to make it an occasion of pride, but by diligently keeping and observing God's commandments, to be in reality what in name we profess to be. For, if the Holy Scriptures say, \"Their lots shall not profit them,\"[fn-17-P1783_427022:1234-nf] what pride in our clerical position[fn-17-P1784_427086:1235-nf] will be able to avail us who sin not only in thought and feeling, but in speech? I have heard, of course, that you are incensed against me, that you are angry, and that you threaten to write about me-not merely to particular places and provinces, but to the uttermost ends of the earth. Where is that fear of God which should make us tremble with the trembling spoken of by the Lord-\"Whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment\"?[fn-17-P1785_427691:1236-nf] Not that I greatly care for your writing what you please. For Isaiah tells us[fn-17-P1786_427791:1237-nf] of letters written on papyrus and cast upon the waters-missives soon carried away by time and tide. I have done you no harm, I have inflicted no injury upon you, I have extorted nothing from you by violence. My action concerned a monastery whose inmates were foreigners in no way subject to your provincial jurisdiction. Moreover their regard for my insignificance and for the letters which I frequently addressed to them had commenced to produce a feeling of dislike to communion with you. Feeling, therefore, that too great strictness or scrupulosity on my part might have the effect of alienating them from the Church with its ancient faith, I ordained one of the brothers deacon, and after he had ministered as such, admitted him to the priesthood. You should, I think, have been grateful to me for this, knowing, as you surely must, that it is the fear of God which has compelled me to act in this way, and particularly when you recollect that God's priesthood is everywhere the same, and that I have simply made provision for the wants of the Church. For, although each individual bishop of the Church has under him churches which are placed in his charge, and although no man may stretch himself beyond his measure,[fn-17-P1787_429043:1238-nf] yet the love of Christ, which is without dissimulation,[fn-17-P1788_429126:1239-nf] is set up as an example to us all; and we must consider not so much the thing done as the time and place, the mode and motive, of doing it. I saw that the monastery contained a large number of reverend brothers, and that the reverend presbyters, Jerome and Vincent, through modesty and humility, were unwilling to offer the sacrifices permitted to their rank, and to labor in that part of their calling which ministers more than any other to the salvation of Christians. I knew, moreover, that you could not find or lay hands on this servant of God[fn-17-P1789_429697:1240-nf] who had several times fled from you simply because he was reluctant to undertake the onerous duties of the priesthood, and that no other bishop could easily find him. Accordingly, I was a good deal surprised when, by the ordering of God, he came to me with the deacons of the monastery and others of the brethren, to make satisfaction to me for some grievance or other which I had against them. While, therefore, the Collect[fn-17-P1790_430196:1241-nf] was being celebrated in the church of the villa which adjoins our monastery-he being quite ignorant and wholly unsuspicious of my purpose-I gave orders to a number of deacons to seize him and to stop his mouth, lest in his eagerness to free himself he might adjure me in the name of Christ. First of all, then, I ordained him deacon, setting before him the fear of God, and forcing him to minister; for he made a hard struggle against it, crying out that he was unworthy, and protesting that this heavy burden was beyond his strength. It was with difficulty, then, that I overcame his reluctance, persuading him as well as I could with passages from Scripture, and setting before him the commandments of God. And when he had ministered in the offering of the holy sacrifices, once more with great difficulty I closed his mouth and ordained him presbyter. Then, using the same arguments as before, I induced him to sit in the place set apart for the presbyters. After this I wrote to the reverend presbyters and other brothers of the monastery, chiding them for not having written to me about him. For a year before I had heard many of them complain that they had no one to celebrate for them the sacraments of the Lord. All then agreed in asking him to undertake the duty, pointing out how great his usefulness would be to the community of the monastery. I blamed them for omitting to write to me and to propose that I should ordain him, when the opportunity was given to them to do so.","index":"574","references":[{"fn":"17","code":"P1783_427022","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Jer. xii. 13, LXX.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"17","code":"P1784_427086","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"A play on words.

All this I have done, as I said just now, relying on that Christian love which you, I feel sure, cherish towards my insignificance; not to mention the fact that I held the ordination in a monastery, and not within the limits of your jurisdiction. How truly blessed is the mildness and complacency of the bishops of (my own) Cyprus, as well as their simplicity, though to your refinement and discrimination it appears deserving only of God's pity! For many bishops in communion with me have ordained presbyters in my province whom I had been unable to capture, and have sent to me deacons and subdeacons[fn-17-P1792_432437:1242-nf] whom I have been glad to receive. I myself, too, have urged the bishop Philo of blessed memory, and the reverend Theoprepus, to make provision for the Church of Christ by ordaining presbyters in those churches of Cyprus which, although they were accounted to belong to my see, happened to be close to them, and this for the reason that my province was large and straggling. But for my part I have never ordained deaconesses nor sent them into the provinces of others,[fn-17-P1793_433070:1243-nf] nor have I done anything to rend the Church. Why, then, have you thought fit to be so angry and indignant with me for that work of God which I have wrought for the edification of the brethren, and not for their destruction?[fn-17-P1794_433349:1244-nf] Moreover, I have been much surprised at the assertion which you have made to my clergy, that you sent me a message by that reverend presbyter, the abbot Gregory, that I was to ordain no one, and that I promised to comply, saying, \"Am I a stripling, or do I not know the canons?\" By God's word I am telling you the truth when I say that I know and have heard nothing of all this, and that I have not the slightest recollection of using any language of the sort. As, however, I have had misgivings, lest possibly, being only a man, I may have forgotten this among so many other matters, I have made inquiry of the reverend Gregory, and of the presbyter Zeno, who is with him. Of these, the abbot Gregory replies that he knows nothing whatever about the matter, while Zeno says that the presbyter Rufinus, in the course of some desultory remarks, spoke these words. \"Will the reverend bishop, think you, venture to ordain any persons?\" but that the conversation went no further. I, Epiphanius, however, have never either received the message or answered it. Do not, then, dearly beloved, allow your anger to overcome you or your indignation to get the better of you, lest, you should disquiet yourself in vain; and lest you should be thought to be putting forward this grievance only to get scope for tendencies of another kind,[fn-17-P1795_434697:1245-nf] and thus to have sought out an occasion of sinning.

For what Catholic, what Christian who adorns his faith with good works, can hear with calmness Origen's teaching and counsel, or believe in his extraordinary preaching? \"The Son,\" he tells us, \"cannot see the Father, and the Holy Spirit cannot see the Son.\" These words occur in his book \"On First Principles;\" thus we read, and thus Origen has spoken. \"For as it is unsuitable to say that the Son can see the Father, it is consequently unsuitable to suppose that the Spirit can see the Son.\"[fn-18-P1803_438397:1251-nf] Can any one, moreover, brook Origen's assertion that men's souls were once angels in heaven, and that having sinned in the upper world, they have been cast down into this, and have been confined in bodies as in barrows or tombs, to pay the penalty for their former sins; and that the bodies of believers are not temples of Christ,[fn-18-P1804_438768:1252-nf] but prisons of the condemned? Again, he tampers with the true meaning of the narrative by a false use of allegory, multiplying words without limit; and undermines the faith of the simple by the most varied arguments. Now he maintains that souls, in Greek the \"cool things,\" from a word meaning to be cool,[fn-18-P1805_439113:1253-nf] are so called because in coming down from the heavenly places to the lower world they have lost their former heat;[fn-18-P1806_439318:1254-nf] and now, that our bodies are called by the Greeks chains, from a word meaning chain,[fn-18-P1807_439436:1255-nf] or else (on the analogy of our own Latin word) \"things fallen,\"[fn-18-P1808_439541:1256-nf] because our souls have fallen from heaven; and that the other word for body which the abundance of the Greek idiom supplies[fn-18-P1809_439715:1257-nf] is by many taken to mean a funeral monument,[fn-18-P1810_439775:1258-nf] because the soul is shut up within it in the same way as the corpses of the dead are shut up in tombs and barrows. If this doctrine is true what becomes of our faith? Where is the preaching of the resurrection? Where is the teaching of the apostles, which lasts on to this day in the churches of Christ? Where is the blessing to Adam, and to his seed, and to Noah and his sons? \"Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.\"[fn-18-P1811_440222:1259-nf] According to Origen, these words must be a curse and not a blessing; for he turns angels into human souls, compelling them to leave the place of highest rank and to come down lower, as though God were unable through the action of His blessing to grant souls to the human race, had the angels not sinned, and as though for every birth on earth there must be a fall in heaven. We are to give up, then, the teaching of apostles and prophets, of the law, and of our Lord and Saviour Himself, in spite of His language loud as thunder in the gospel. Origen, on the other hand, commands and urges-not to say binds-his disciples not to pray to ascend into heaven, lest sinning once more worse than they had sinned on earth they should be hurled down into the world again. Such foolish and insane notions he generally confirms by distorting the sense of the Scriptures and making them mean what they do not mean at all. He quotes this passage from the Psalms: \"Before thou didst humble me by reason of my wickedness, I went wrong;\"[fn-18-P1812_441278:1260-nf] and this, \"Return unto thy rest, O my soul;\"[fn-18-P1813_441398:1261-nf] this also, \"Bring my soul out of prison;\"[fn-18-P1814_441462:1262-nf] and this, \"I will make confession unto the Lord in the land of the living,\"[fn-18-P1815_441562:1263-nf] although there can be no doubt that the meaning of the divine Scripture is different from the interpretation by which he unfairly wrests it to the support of his own heresy. This way of acting is common to the Manichaeans, the Gnostics, the Ebionites, the Marcionites, and the votaries of the other eighty heresies,[fn-18-P1816_441946:1264-nf] all of whom draw their proofs from the pure well of the Scriptures, not, however, interpreting it in the sense in which it is written, but trying to make the simple language of the Church's writers accord with their own wishes.","index":"577","references":[{"fn":"18","code":"P1802_437773","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Matt. xviii. 8, Matt. xviii. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":18,"verses":[8]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":18,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1803_438397","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"First Principles, i. 1; ii. 4.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1804_438768","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1 Cor. vi. 15, 1 Cor. vi. 19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":6,"verses":[15]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1805_439113","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"yuxai apo tou yuxesqai.

Among many other things, he says this: \"Was God a tanner or a saddler, that He should prepare the hides of animals, and should stitch from them coats of skins for Adam and Eve?\" \"It is clear,\" he goes on, \"that he is speaking of human bodies.\" If this is so, how is it that before the coats of skins, and the disobedience, and the fall from paradise, Adam speaks not in an allegory, but literally, thus: \"This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh;\"[fn-18-P1819_443446:1266-nf] or what is the ground of the divine narrative, \"And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man, made He a woman\"[fn-18-P1820_443724:1267-nf] for him?

For it is not now my intention to argue against all his opinions. Origen has not lived in my day, nor has he robbed me. I have not conceived a dislike to him nor quarrelled with him because of an inheritance or of any worldly matter; but-to speak plainly-I grieve, and grieve bitterly, to see numbers of my brothers, and of those in particular who show the most promise, and have reached the highest rank in the sacred ministry,[fn-18-P1839_448541:1285-nf] deceived by his persuasive arguments, and made by his most perverse teaching the food of the devil, whereby the saying is fulfilled: \"He derides every stronghold, and his fare is choice, and he hath gathered captives as the sand.\"[fn-18-P1840_448794:1286-nf] But may God free you, my brother, and the holy people of Christ which is intrusted to you, and all the brothers who are with you, and especially the presbyter Rufinus, from the heresy of Origen, and other heresies, and from the perdition to which they lead. For, if for one word or for two opposed to the faith many heresies have been rejected by the Church, how much more shall he be held a heretic who has contrived such perverse interpretations and such mischievous doctrines to destroy the faith, and has in fact declared himself the enemy of the Church! For, among other wicked things, he has presumed to say this, too, that Adam lost the image of God, although Scripture nowhere declares that he did. Were it so, never would all the creatures in the world be subject to Adam's seed-that is, to the entire human race; yet, in the words of the apostle, everything \"is tamed and hath been tamed of mankind.\"[fn-18-P1841_449738:1287-nf] For never would all things be subjected to men if men had not-together with their authority over all-the image of God. But the divine Scripture conjoins and associates with this the grace of the blessing which was conferred upon Adam and upon the generations which descended from him. No one can by twisting the meaning of words presume to say that this grace of God was given to one only, and that he alone was made in the image of God (he and his wife, that is, for while he was formed of clay she was made of one of his ribs), but that those who were subsequently conceived in the womb and not born as was Adam did not possess God's image, for the Scripture immediately subjoins the following statement: \"And Adam lived two hundred and thirty years,[fn-18-P1842_450513:1288-nf] and knew Eve his wife, and she bare him a son in his image and after his likeness, and called his name Seth.\"[fn-18-P1843_450707:1289-nf] And again, in the tenth generation, two thousand two hundred and forty-two years afterwards,[fn-18-P1844_450845:1290-nf] God, to vindicate His own image and to show that the grace which He had given to men still continued in them, gives the following commandment: \"Flesh ...with the blood thereof shall ye not eat. And surely your blood will I require at the hand of every man that sheddeth it; for in the image of God have I made man.\"[fn-18-P1845_451264:1291-nf] From Noah to Abraham ten generations passed away,[fn-18-P1846_451362:1292-nf] and from Abraham's time to David's, fourteen more,[fn-18-P1847_451438:1293-nf] and these twenty-four generations make up, taken together, two thousand one hundred and seventeen years.[fn-18-P1848_451565:1294-nf] Yet the Holy Spirit in the thirty-ninth[fn-18-P1849_451663:1295-nf] psalm, while lamenting that all men walk in a vain show, and that they are subject to sins, speaks thus: \"For all that every man walk eth in the image.\"[fn-18-P1850_451891:1296-nf] Also after David's time, in the reign of Solomon his son, we read a somewhat similar reference to the divine likeness. For in the book of Wisdom, which is inscribed with his name, Solomon says: \"God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of His own eternity.\"[fn-18-P1851_452211:1297-nf] And again, about eleven hundred and eleven years afterwards, we read in the New Testament that men have not lost the image of God. For James, an apostle and brother of the Lord, whom I have mentioned above-that we may not be entangled in the snares of Origen-teaches us that man does possess God's image and likeness. For, after a somewhat discursive account of the human tongue, he has gone on to say of it: \"It is an unruly evil ...therewith bless we God, even the Father and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.\"[fn-18-P1852_452779:1298-nf] Paul, too, the \"chosen vessel,\"[fn-18-P1853_452836:1299-nf] who in his preaching has fully maintained the doctrine of the gospel, instructs us that man is made in the image and after the likeness of God. \"A man,\" he says, \"ought not to wear long hair, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God.\"[fn-18-P1854_453099:1300-nf] He speaks of \"the image\" simply, but explains the nature of the likeness by the word \"glory.\"","index":"579","references":[{"fn":"18","code":"P1835_447291","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Prov. vi. 20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"proverbs","chapter":6,"verses":[20]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1836_447575","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Isa. xxxii. 6, Vulg.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":32,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"18","code":"P1837_447752","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Cf.

Instead of the three proofs from Holy Scripture which you said would satisfy you if I could produce them, behold I have given you seven. Who, then, will put up with the follies of Origen? I will not use a severer word and so make myself like him or his followers, who presume at the peril of their soul to assert dogmatically whatever first comes into their head, and to dictate to God, whereas they ought either to pray to Him or to learn the truth from Him. For some of them say that the image of God which Adam had previously received was lost when he sinned. Others surmise that the body which the Son of God was destined to take of Mary was the image of the Creator. Some identify this image with the soul, others with sensation, others with virtue. These make it baptism, those assert that it is in virtue of God's image that man exercises universal sway. Like drunkards in their cups, they ejaculate now this, now that, when they ought rather to have avoided so serious a risk, and to have obtained salvation by simple faith, not denying the words of God. To God they ought to have left the sure and exact knowledge of His own gift, and of the particular way in which He has created men in His image and after His likeness. Forsaking this course, they have involved themselves in many subtle questions, and through these they have been plunged into the mire of sin. But we, dearly beloved, believe the words of the Lord, and know that God's image remains in all men, and we leave it to Him to know in what respect man is created in His image. And let no one be deceived by that passage in the epistle of John, which some readers fail to understand, where he says: \"Now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall See Him as He is.\"[fn-18-P1856_455057:1301-nf] For this refers to the glory which is then to be revealed[fn-18-P1857_455139:1302-nf] to His saints; just as also in another place we read the words \"from glory to glory,\"[fn-18-P1858_455247:1303-nf] of which glory the saints have even in this world received an earnest and a small portion.

As soon as I heard this, I promised that I would give one, and said that I would send it at once.

Wax is soft and easy to mould even where the hands of craftsman and modeller are wanting to work it. It is already potentially all that it can be made. The apostle Paul learned the Law of Moses and the prophets at the feet of Gamaliel and was glad that he had done so, for armed with this spiritual armour, he was able to say boldly \"the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds;\" armed with these we war \"casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; and being in a readiness to revenge all disobedience.\"[fn-20-P2014_502088:1412-nf] He writes to Timothy who had been trained in the holy writings from a child exhorting him to study them diligently[fn-20-P2015_502227:1413-nf] and not to neglect the gift which was given him with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.[fn-20-P2016_502367:1414-nf] To Titus he gives commandment that among a bishop's other virtues (which he briefly describes) he should be careful to seek a knowledge of the scriptures: A bishop, he says, must hold fast \"the faithful word as he hath been taught that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.\"[fn-20-P2017_502708:1415-nf] In fact want of education in a clergyman[fn-20-P2018_502769:1416-nf] prevents him from doing good to any one but himself and much as the virtue of his life may build up Christ's church, he does it an injury as great by failing to resist those who are trying to pull it down.

Hosea speaks many times of Ephraim, of Samaria, of Joseph, of Jezreel, of a wife of whoredoms and of children of whoredoms,[fn-20-P2082_516313:1464-nf] of an adulteress shut up within the chamber of her husband, sitting for a long time in widowhood and in the garb of mourning, awaiting the time when her husband will return to her.[fn-20-P2083_516514:1465-nf] Joel the son of Pethuel describes the land of the twelve tribes as spoiled and devastated by the palmerworm the canker-worm, the locust, and the blight,[fn-20-P2084_516695:1466-nf] and predicts that after the overthrow of the former people the Holy Spirit shall be poured out upon God's servants and handmaids;[fn-20-P2085_516845:1467-nf] the same spirit, that is, which was to be poured out in the upper chamber at Zion upon the one hundred and twenty believers.[fn-20-P2086_516992:1468-nf] These believers rising by gradual and regular gradations from one to fifteen form the steps to which there is a mystical allusion in the \"psalms of degrees.\"[fn-20-P2087_517183:1469-nf] Amos, although he is only \"an herdman\" from the country, \"a gatherer of sycomore fruit,\"[fn-20-P2088_517386:1470-nf] cannot be explained in a few words. For who can adequately speak of the three transgressions and the four of Damascus, of Gaza, of Tyre, of Idumaea, of Moab, of the children of Ammon, and in the seventh and eighth place of Judah and of Israel? He speaks to the fat kine that are in the mountain of Samaria,[fn-20-P2089_517716:1471-nf] and bears witness that the great house and the little house shall fall.[fn-20-P2090_517809:1472-nf] He sees now the maker of the grasshopper,[fn-20-P2091_517873:1473-nf] now the Lord, standing upon a wall[fn-20-P2092_517930:1474-nf] daubed[fn-20-P2093_517959:1475-nf] or made of adamant,[fn-20-P2094_518004:1476-nf] now a basket of apples[fn-20-P2095_518048:1477-nf] that brings doom to the transgressors, and now a famine upon the earth \"not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord.\"[fn-20-P2096_518229:1478-nf] Obadiah, whose name means the servant of God, thunders against Edom red with blood and against the creature born of earth.[fn-20-P2097_518376:1479-nf] He smites him with the spear of the spirit because of his continual rivalry with his brother Jacob. Jonah, fairest of doves, whose shipwreck shews in a figure the passion of the Lord, recalls the world to penitence, and while he preaches to Nineveh, announces salvation to all the heathen. Micah the Morasthite a joint heir with Christ[fn-20-P2098_518792:1480-nf] announces the spoiling of the daughter of the robber and lays siege against her, because she has smitten the jawbone of the judge of Israel.[fn-20-P2099_519018:1481-nf] Nahum, the consoler of the world, rebukes \"the bloody city\"[fn-21-P2100_519104:1482-nf] and when it is overthrown cries: -\"Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings.\"[fn-21-P2101_519247:1483-nf] Habakkuk, like a strong and unyielding wrestler,[fn-21-P2102_519318:1484-nf] stands upon his watch and sets his foot upon the tower[fn-21-P2103_519419:1485-nf] that he may contemplate Christ upon the cross and say \"His glory covered the heavens and the earth was full of his praise. And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.\"[fn-21-P2104_519677:1486-nf] Zephaniah, that is the bodyguard and knower of the secrets of the Lord,[fn-21-P2105_519784:1487-nf] hears \"a cry from the fishgate, and an howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.\"[fn-21-P2106_519938:1488-nf] He proclaims \"howling to the inhabitants of the mortar;[fn-21-P2107_520016:1489-nf] for all the people of Canaan are undone; all they that were laden with silver are cut off.\"[fn-21-P2108_520161:1490-nf] Haggai, that is he who is glad or joyful, who has sown in tears to reap in joy,[fn-21-P2109_520267:1491-nf] is occupied with the rebuilding of the temple. He represents the Lord(the Father, that is) as saying \"Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land; and I will shake all nations and he who is desired[fn-21-P2110_520552:1492-nf] of all nations shall come'[fn-21-P2111_520616:1493-nf] Zechariah, he that is mindful of his Lord,[fn-21-P2112_520692:1494-nf] gives us many prophecies. He sees Jesus,[fn-21-P2113_520776:1495-nf] \"clothed with filthy garments,\"[fn-21-P2114_520847:1496-nf] a stone with seven eyes,[fn-21-P2115_520895:1497-nf] a candle-stick all of gold with lamps as many as the eyes, and two olivetrees on the right side of the bowl[fn-21-P2116_521026:1498-nf] and on the left. After he has described the horses, red, black, white, and grisled,[fn-21-P2117_521145:1499-nf] and the cutting off of the chariot from Ephraim and of the horse from Jerusalem[fn-21-P2118_521249:1500-nf] he goes on to prophesy and predict a king who shall be a poor man and who shall sit \"upon a colt the foal of an ass.\"[fn-21-P2119_521390:1501-nf] Malachi, the last of all the prophets, speaks openly of the rejection of Israel and the calling of the nations. \"I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same, my name is great among the Gentiles: and in every place incense[fn-21-P2120_521758:1502-nf] is offered unto my name, and a pure offering.\"[fn-21-P2121_521844:1503-nf] As for Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel, who can fully understand or adequately explain them? The first of them seems to compose not a prophecy but a gospel. The second speaks of a rod of an almond tree[fn-21-P2122_522089:1504-nf] and of a seething pot with its face toward the north,[fn-21-P2123_522164:1505-nf] and of a leopard which has changed its spots.[fn-21-P2124_522231:1506-nf] He also goes four times through the alphabet in different metres.[fn-21-P2125_522321:1507-nf] The beginning and ending of Ezekiel, the third of the four, are involved in so great obscurity that like the commencement of Genesis they are not studied by the Hebrews until they are thirty years old. Daniel, the fourth and last of the four prophets, having knowledge of the times and being interested in the whole world, in clear language proclaims the stone cut out of the mountain without hands that overthrows all kingdoms.[fn-21-P2126_522852:1508-nf] David, who is our Simonides, Pindar, and Alcaeus, our Horace, our Catullus, and our Serenus all in one, sings of Christ to his lyre; and on a psaltery with ten strings calls him from the lower world to rise again. Solomon, a lover of peace[fn-21-P2127_523114:1509-nf] and of the Lord, corrects morals, teaches nature, unites Christ and the church, and sings a sweet marriage song[fn-21-P2128_523258:1510-nf] to celebrate that holy bridal. Esther, a type of the church, frees her people from danger and, after having slain Haman whose name means iniquity, hands down to posterity a memorable day and a great feast.[fn-21-P2129_523492:1511-nf] The book of things omitted[fn-21-P2130_523569:1512-nf] or epitome of the old dispensation[fn-21-P2131_523683:1513-nf] is of such importance and value that without it any one who should claim to himself a knowledge of the scriptures would make himself a laughing stock in his own eyes. Every name used in it, nay even the conjunction of the words, serves to throw light on narratives passed over in the books of Kings and upon questions suggested by the gospel. Ezra and Nehemiah, that is the Lord's helper and His consoler, are united in a single book. They restore the Temple and build up the walls of the city. In their pages we see the throng of the Israelites returning to their native land, we read of priests and Levites, of Israel proper and of proselytes; and we are even told the several families to which the task of building the walls and towers was assigned. These references convey one meaning upon the surface, but another below it.","index":"641","references":[{"fn":"20","code":"P2064_512271","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Cc. 1-2.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"20","code":"P2065_512316","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"C. x.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"20","code":"P2066_512357","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"C. xi.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"20","code":"P2067_512416","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"C. xlvi.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"20","code":"P2068_512530","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Cc. vii-xii.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"20","code":"P2069_512567","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"C. xx.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"20","code":"P2070_512798","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"C. viii.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"20","code":"P2071_512949","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"C. xxvi.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"20","code":"P2072_512990","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Cc. xxiii., xxiv.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"20","code":"P2073_513068","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"C. xxxiii.

The apostles James, Peter, John, and Jude, have published seven epistles at once spiritual and to the point, short and long, short that is in words but lengthy in substance so that there are few indeed who do not find themselves in the dark when they read them. The apocalypse of John has as many mysteries as words. In saying this I have said less than the book deserves.

Neither the fiery Etna nor the country of Vulcan,[fn-22-P2213_544640:1571-nf] nor Vesuvius, nor Olympus, burns with such violent heat as the youthful marrow of those who are flushed with wine and filled with food. Many trample covetousness under foot, and lay it down as readily as they lay down their purse. An enforced silence serves to make amends for a railing tongue. The outward appearance and the mode of dress can be changed in a single hour. All other sins are external, and what is external can easily be cast away. Desire alone, implanted in men by God to lead them to procreate children, is internal; and this, if it once oversteps its own bounds, becomes a sin, and by a law of nature cries out for sexual intercourse. It is therefore a work of great merit, and one which requires unremitting diligence to overcome that which is innate in you; while living in the flesh not to live after the flesh; to strive with yourself day by day and to watch the foe shut up within you with the hundred eyes of the fabled Argus.[fn-22-P2214_545641:1572-nf] This is what the apostle says in other words: \"Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.\"[fn-22-P2215_545887:1573-nf] Physicians and others who have written on the nature of the human body, and particularly Galen in his books entitled On matters of health, say that the bodies of boys and of young men and of full grown men and women glow with an interior heat and consequently that for persons of these ages all food is injurious which tends to promote this heat: while on the other hand it is highly conducive to health in eating and in drinking to take things cold and cooling.

We do not expect that it will be so with us, but we look for increased vigour of soul which becomes stronger as the flesh grows weaker. Some persons who aspire to the life of chastity fall midway in their journey from supposing that they need only abstain from flesh. They load their stomachs with vegetables which are only harmless when taken sparingly and in moderation. If I am to say what I think, there is nothing which so much heats the body and inflames the passions as undigested food and breathing broken with hiccoughs. As for you, my daughter, I would rather wound your modesty than endanger my case by understatement. Regard everything as poison which bears within it the seeds of sensual pleasure. A meagre diet which leaves the appetite always unsatisfied is to be preferred to fasts three days long.

Why need we extend our thoughts to contingencies, to objects which we either cannot obtain or else having obtained must soon relinquish?

Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid. What! Know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? For two, saith he, shall be one flesh.

Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body,\"[fn-22-P2288_569235:1629-nf] and so on. The holy apostle has been arguing against excess and has just before said \"meats for the belly and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them.\"[fn-22-P2289_569435:1630-nf] Now he comes to treat of fornication. For excess in eating is the mother of lust; a belly that is distended with food and saturated with draughts of wine is sure to lead to sensual passion. As has been elsewhere said \"the arrangement of man's organs suggests the course of his vices.\"[fn-22-P2290_569744:1631-nf] Accordingly all such sins as theft, manslaughter, pillage, perjury, and the like can be repented of after they have been committed; and, however much interest may tempt him, conscience always smites the offender. It is only lust and sensual pleasure that in the very hour of penitence undergo once more the temptations of the past, the itch of the flesh, and the allurements of sin; so that the very thought which we bestow on the correction of such transgressions becomes in itself a new source of sin. Or to put the matter in a different light: other sins are outside of us; and whatever we do we do against others. But fornication defiles the fornicator both in conscience and body; and in accordance with the words of the Lord, \"for this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they twain shall be one flesh,\"[fn-22-P2291_570631:1632-nf] he too becomes one body with a harlot and sins against his own body by making what is the temple of Christ the body of a harlot. Not to pass over any suggestion of the Greek commentators, I shall give you one more explanation. It is one thing, they say, to sin with the body, and another to sin in the body. Theft, manslaughter, and all other sins except fornication we commit with our hands outside ourselves. Fornication alone we commit inside ourselves in our bodies and not with our bodies upon others. The preposition `with' denotes the instrument used in sinning, while the preposition `in' signifies the sphere of the passion is ourselves. Some again give this explanation that according to the scripture a man's body is his wife and that when a man commits fornication he is said to sin against his own body that is against his wife inasmuch as he defiles her by his own fornication and causes her though herself free from sin to become a sinner through her intercourse with him.","index":"680","references":[{"fn":"22","code":"P2286_568181","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1 Cor. vi. 18.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":6,"verses":[18]}]},{"fn":"22","code":"P2287_568427","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Capitulum, \"Passage.\" The present division of the Bible into chapters did not exist in Jerome's time.

I find joined to your letter of inquiries a short paper containing the following words: \"ask him,(that is me,) whether a woman who has left her husband on the ground that he is an adulterer and sodomite and has found herself compelled to take another may in the lifetime of him whom she first left be in communion with the church without doing penance for her fault.\" As I read the case put I recall the verse \"they make excuses for their sins.\"[fn-22-P2293_572105:1633-nf] We are all the and a indulgent to our own faults; and what our own will leads us to do we attribute to a necessity of nature. It is as though a young man were to say, \"I am over-borne by my body, the glow of nature kindles my passions, the structure of my frame and its reproductive organs call for sexual intercourse.\" Or again a murderer might say, \"I was in want, I stood in need of food, I had nothing to cover me. If i shed the blood of another, it was to save myself from dying of cold and hunger.\" Tell the sister, therefore, who thus enquires of me concerning her condition, not my sentence but that of the apostle. \"Know ye not, brethren (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth? For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband, so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband. So then, if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress.\"[fn-22-P2294_573155:1634-nf] And in another place: \"the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.\"[fn-22-P2295_573359:1635-nf] The apostle has thus cut away every plea and has clearly declared that, if a woman marries again while her husband is living, she is an adulteress. You must not speak to me of the violence of a ravisher, a mother's pleading, a father's bidding, the influence of relatives, the insolence and the intrigues of servants, household losses. A husband may be an adulterer or a sodomite, he may be stained with every crime and may have been left by his wife because of his sins; yet he is still her husband and, so long as he lives, she may not marry another. The apostle does not promulgate this decree on his own authority but on that of Christ who speaks in him. For he has followed the words of Christ in the gospel: \"whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced, committeth adultery.\"[fn-22-P2296_574273:1636-nf] Mark what he says: \"whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.\" Whether she has put away her husband or her husband her, the man who marries her is still an adulterer. Wherefore the apostles seeing how heavy the yoke of marriage was thus made said to Him: \"if the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry,\" and the Lord replied, \"he that is able to receive it, let him receive it.\" And immediately by the instance of the three eunuchs he shows the blessedness of virginity which is bound by no carnal tie.[fn-22-P2297_574843:1637-nf] ","index":"681","references":[{"fn":"22","code":"P2293_572105","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Ps. clxi. 4 Vulg.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":161,"verses":[4]}]},{"fn":"22","code":"P2294_573155","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Rom. vii. 1-3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":7,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"22","code":"P2295_573359","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1 Cor. vii. 39.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":7,"verses":[39]}]},{"fn":"22","code":"P2296_574273","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Matt. v. 32.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":5,"verses":[32]}]},{"fn":"22","code":"P2297_574843","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Matt. xix. 10-12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":19,"verses":[10]}]}]},{"text":"4. I have not been able quite to determine what it is that she means by the words \"has found herself compelled\" to marry again. What is this compulsion of which she speaks? Was she overborne by a crowd and ravished against her will? If so, why has she not, thus victimized, subsequently put away her ravisher? Let her read the books of Moses and she will find that if violence is offered to a betrothed virgin in a city and she does not cry out, she is punished as an adulteress: but if she is forced in the field, she is innocent of sin and her ravisher alone is amenable to the laws.[fn-22-P2299_575456:1638-nf] Therefore if your sister, who, as she says, has been forced into a second union, wishes to receive the body of Christ and not to be accounted an adulteress, let her do penance; so far at least as from the time she begins to repent to have no farther intercourse with that second husband who ought to be called not a husband but an adulterer. If this seems hard to her and if she cannot leave one whom she has once loved and will not prefer the Lord to sensual pleasure, let her hear the declaration of the apostle: \"ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table and of the table of devils,\"[fn-23-P2300_576131:1639-nf] and in another place: \"what communion hath light with darkness? and what concord hath Christ with Belial?\"[fn-23-P2301_576261:1640-nf] What I am about to say may sound novel but after all it is not new but old for it is supported by the witness of the old testament.

And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's wife. And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house; or if the latter husband die which took her to be his wife; her former husband, which sent her away may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the Lord: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.\"[fn-23-P2302_577339:1641-nf] Wherefore, I beseech you, do your best to comfort her and to urge her to seek salvation. Diseased flesh calls for the knife and the searing-iron.

But when he saith, all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.

Yet I may at least say a few words. The chief stumbling-block in the passage is that the Son is said to be subject to the Father. Now which is the more shameful and humiliating, to be subject to the Father (often a mark of loving devotion as in the psalm \"truly my soul is subject unto God\"[fn-23-P2306_578827:1644-nf] ) or to be crucified and made the curse of the cross? For \"cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree.\"[fn-23-P2307_578958:1645-nf] If Christ then for our sakes was made a curse that He might deliver us from the curse of the law, are you surprised that lie is also for our sakes subject to the Father to make us too subject to Him as He says in the gospel: \"No man cometh unto the Father but by me,\"[fn-23-P2308_579249:1646-nf] and \"I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.\"[fn-23-P2309_579341:1647-nf] Christ then is subject to the Father in the faithful; for all believers, nay the whole human race, are accounted members of His body. But in unbelievers, that is in Jews, heathens, and heretics, He is said to be not subject; for these members of His body are not subject to the faith. But in the end of the world when all His members shall see Christ, that is their own body, reigning, they also shall be made subject to Christ, that is to their own body, that the whole of Christ's body may be subject unto God and the Father, and that God may be all in all. He does not say \"that the Father may be all in all\" but that \"God\" may be, a title which properly belongs to the Trinity and may be referred not only to the Father but also to the Son and to the Holy Ghost. His meaning therefore is \"that humanity may be subject to the Godhead.\" By humanity we here intend not that gentleness and kindness which the Greeks call philanthropy but the whole human race. Moreover when he says \"that God may be all in all,\" it is to be taken in this sense. At present our Lord and Saviour is not all in all, but only a part in each of us. For instance He is wisdom in Solomon, generosity in David, patience in Job, knowledge of things to come in Daniel faith in Peter, zeal in Phinehas and Paul, virginity in John, and other virtues in others. But when the end of all things shall come, then shall He be all in all, for then the saints shall severally possess all the virtues and all will possess Christ in His entirety.","index":"683","references":[{"fn":"23","code":"P2305_578271","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1 Cor. xv. 25-28.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":15,"verses":[25]}]},{"fn":"23","code":"P2306_578827","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Ps. lxii. 1, Vulg.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":62,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"23","code":"P2307_578958","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Gal. iii. 13.","bible_refs":[{"book":"galatians","chapter":3,"verses":[13]}]},{"fn":"23","code":"P2308_579249","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Joh. xiv. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":14,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"23","code":"P2309_579341","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Joh. xii. 32.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":12,"verses":[32]}]}]},{"text":"\nLetter LVI.

For a rash tongue charges me with ignorance or falsehood; it alleges that in translating another man's letter I have made mistakes through incapacity or carelessness; it convicts me of either an involuntary error or a deliberate offence. And test it should happen that my accuser-encouraged by a volubility which stops at nothing and by an impunity which arrogates to itself an unlimited license-should accuse me as he has already done our father (Pope) Epiphanius; I send this letter to inform you-and through yon others who think me worthy of their regard-of the true order of the facts.","index":"689","references":[{"fn":"23","code":"P2318_583249","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Acts xxvi. 2, Acts xxvi. 3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"the acts","chapter":26,"verses":[2]},{"book":"the acts","chapter":26,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"23","code":"P2319_583319","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"i.e., the son of Sirach.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"23","code":"P2320_583417","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Ecclus. xxv. 9.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"2. About two years ago the aforesaid Pope Epiphanius sent a letter[fn-23-P2322_584262:1651-nf] to Bishop John, first finding fault with him as regarded some of his opinions and then mildly calling him to penitence. Such was the repute of the writer or else the elegance of the letter that all Palestine fought for copies of it. Now there was in our monastery a man of no small estimation in his country, Eusebius of Cremona, who, when he found that this letter was in everybody's mouth and that the ignorant and the educated alike admired it for its teaching and for the purity of its style, set to work to beg me to translate it for him into Latin and at the same time to simplify tile argument so that he might more readily understand it; for he was himself altogether unacquainted with the Greek language. I consented to his request and calling to my aid a secretary speedily dictated my version, briefly marking on the side of the page the contents of the several chapters. The fact is that he asked me to do this merely for himself, and I requested of him in return to keep his copy private and not too readily to circulate it. A year and six months went by, and then the aforesaid translation found its way by a novel stratagem from his desk to Jerusalem. For a pretended monk-either bribed as there is much reason to believe or actuated by malice of his own as his tempter vainly tries to convince us-shewed himself a second Judas by robbing Eusebius of his literary property and gave to the adversary an occasion of railing[fn-23-P2323_585746:1652-nf] against me.

For though they welcome the profit which the information gives them, they disapprove the motive which actuates the informer. A little while ago a man of consular rank named Hesychius (against whom the patriarch Gamaliel waged an implacable war) was condemned to death by the emperor Theodosius simply because he had laid hold of imperial papers through a secretary whom he had tempted. We read also in old histories[fn-23-P2326_587514:1654-nf] that the schoolmaster who betrayed the children of the Faliscans was sent back to his boys and handed over to them in bonds, the Roman people refusing to accept a dishonourable victory. When Pyrrhus king of Epirus was lying in his camp ill from the effects of a wound, his physician offered to poison him, but Fabricius thinking it shame that the king should die by treachery sent the traitor back in chains to his master, refusing to sanction crime even when its victim was an enemy.[fn-23-P2327_588020:1655-nf] A principle which the laws uphold, which is maintained by enemies, which warfare and the sword fail to violate, has hitherto been held unquestioned among the monks and priests of Christ.

That secular and church writers should have adopted this line need not surprise us when we consider that the translators of the Septuagint,[fn-23-P2351_597144:1672-nf] the evangelists, and the apostles, have done the same in dealing with the sacred writings. We read in Mark[fn-23-P2352_597290:1673-nf] of the Lord saying Talitha cumi and it is immediately added \"which is interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.\" The evangelist may he charged with falsehood for having added the words \"I say unto thee\" for the Hebrew is only \"Damsel arise.\" To emphasize this and to give the impression of one calling and commanding he has added \"I say unto thee.\" Again in Matthew[fn-23-P2353_597680:1674-nf] when the thirty pieces of silver are returned by the traitor Judas and the potter's field is purchased with them, it is written:-\"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken of by Jeremy the prophet, saying, \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him that was valued which[fn-23-P2354_598013:1675-nf] they of the children of Israel did value, and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.\" This passage is not found in Jeremiah at all but in Zechariah, in quite different words and an altogether different order. In fact the Vulgate renders it as follows:-\"And I will say unto them, If it is good in your sight, give ye me a price or refuse it: So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver. And the Lord said unto me, Put them into the melting furnace and consider if it is tried as I have been tried by them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver and cast them into the house of the Lord.\"[fn-23-P2355_598663:1676-nf] It is evident that the rendering of the Septuagint differs widely from the quotation of the evangelist. In the Hebrew also, though the sense is the same, the words are quite different and differently arranged. It says: \"And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and, if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver. And the Lord said unto me, Cast it unto the potter;[fn-23-P2356_599102:1677-nf] a goodly price that I was priced at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver and cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord.\"[fn-23-P2357_599262:1678-nf] They may accuse the apostle of falsifying his version seeing that it agrees neither with the Hebrew nor with the translators of the Septuagint: and worse than this, they may say that he has mistaken the author's name putting down Jeremiah when it should be Zechariah. Far be it from us to speak thus of a follower[fn-23-P2358_599617:1679-nf] of Christ, who made it his care to formulate dogmas rather than to hunt for words and syllables. To take another instance from Zechariah, the evangelist John quotes from the Hebrew, \"They shall look on him whom they pierced,\"[fn-23-P2359_599865:1680-nf] for which we read in the Septuagint, \"And they shall look upon me because they have mocked me,\" and in the Latin version, \"And they shall look upon me for the things which they have mocked or insulted.\" Here the evangelist, the Septuagint, and our own version[fn-23-P2360_600163:1681-nf] all differ; yet the divergence of language is atoned by oneness of spirit. In Matthew again we read of the Lord preaching flight to the apostles and confirming His counsel with a passage from Zechariah. \"It is written,\" he says, \"I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.\"[fn-23-P2361_600583:1682-nf] But in the Septuagint and in the Hebrew it reads differently, for it is not God who speaks, as the evangelist makes out, but the prophet who appeals to God the Father saying:-\"Smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.\" In this instance according to my judgment-and I have some careful critics with me-the evangelist is guilty of a fault in presuming to ascribe to God what are the words of the prophet. Again the same evangelist writes that at the warning of an angel Joseph took the young child and his mother and went into Egypt and remained there till the death of Herod; \"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.\"[fn-23-P2362_601326:1683-nf] The Latin manuscripts do not so give the passage, but in Hosea[fn-23-P2363_601415:1684-nf] the true Hebrew text has the following:-\"When Israel was a child then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.\" Which the Septuagint renders thus:-\"When Israel was a child then I loved him, and called his sons out of Egypt.\" Are they[fn-23-P2364_601674:1685-nf] altogether to be rejected because they have given another turn to a passage which refers primarily to the mystery of Christ? Or should we not rather pardon the shortcomings of the translators on the score of their human frailty according to the saying of James, \"In many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word the same is a perfect man and able also to bridle the whole body.\"[fn-23-P2365_602116:1686-nf] Once more it is written in the pages of the same evangelist, \"And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.\"[fn-23-P2366_602343:1687-nf] Let these word fanciers and nice critics of all composition tell us where they have read the words; and if they cannot, let me tell them that they are in Isaiah.[fn-23-P2367_602529:1688-nf] For in the place where we read and translate, \"There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots,\"[fn-23-P2368_602695:1689-nf] in the Hebrew idiom it is written thus, \"There shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse and a Nazarene shall grow from his root.\" How can the Septuagint leave out the word `Nazarene,' if it is unlawful to substitute one word for another? It is sacrilege either to conceal or to set at naught a mystery.","index":"698","references":[{"fn":"23","code":"P2351_597144","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Lit. the seventy translators.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"23","code":"P2352_597290","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Mark v. 41.","bible_refs":[{"book":"mark","chapter":5,"verses":[41]}]},{"fn":"23","code":"P2353_597680","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Matthew xxvii. 9, Matthew xxvii. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":27,"verses":[9]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":27,"verses":[10]}]},{"fn":"23","code":"P2354_598013","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Quod.

In the same evangelist we read that Herod was troubled at the coming of the Magi and that gathering together the scribes and the priests he demanded of them where Christ should be born and that they answered him, \"In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet; And thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah art not the least among the princes of Judah, for out of thee shall come a governour that shall rule my people Israel.\"[fn-23-P2372_604494:1692-nf] In the Vulgate[fn-23-P2373_604544:1693-nf] this passage appears as follows:-\"And thou Bethlehem, the house of Ephratah, art small to be among the thousands of Judah, yet one shall come out of thee for me to be a prince in Israel.\" You will be more surprised still at the difference in words and order between Matthew and the Septuagint if you look at the Hebrew which runs thus:-\"But thou Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel.\"[fn-23-P2374_605157:1694-nf] Consider one by one the words of the evangelist:-\"And thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah.\" For \"the land of Judah\" the Hebrew has \"Ephratah\" while the Septuagint gives \"the house of Ephratah.\" The evangelist writes, \"art not the least among the princes of Judah.\" In the Septuagint this is, \"art small to be among the thousands of Judah,\" while the Hebrew gives, \"though thou be little among the thousands of Judah.\" There is a contradiction here-and that not merely verbal-between the evangelist and the prophet; for in this place at any rate both Septuagint and Hebrew agree. The evangelist says that he is not little among the princes of Judah, while the passage from which he queries says exactly the opposite of this, \"Thou art small indeed and little; but yet out of thee, small and little as thou art, there shall come forth for me a leader in Israel,\" a sentiment in harmony with that of the apostle, \"God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty.\"[fn-23-P2375_606175:1695-nf] Moreover the last clause \"to rule\" or \"to feed my people Israel\" clearly runs differently in the original.","index":"699","references":[{"fn":"23","code":"P2370_603399","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Matt. i. 22, Matt. i. 23: Isa. vii. 14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":1,"verses":[22]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":1,"verses":[23]},{"book":"isaiah","chapter":7,"verses":[14]}]},{"fn":"23","code":"P2371_603863","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"AV.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"23","code":"P2372_604494","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Matt. ii. 5, Matt. ii. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":2,"verses":[5]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":2,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"23","code":"P2373_604544","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"i.e. the Versio Itala which was vulgata or `commonly used\f0' at this time as Jerome's Version was afterwards.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"23","code":"P2374_605157","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Mic. v. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"micah","chapter":5,"verses":[2]}]},{"fn":"23","code":"P2375_606175","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1 Cor. i. 27.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":1,"verses":[27]}]}]},{"text":"9. I refer to these passages, not to convict the evangelists of falsification-a charge worthy only of impious men like Celsus, Porphyry, and Julian-but to bring home to my critics their own want of knowledge, and to gain from them such consideration that they may concede to me in the case of a simple letter what, whether they like it or not, they will have to concede to the Apostles in the Holy Scriptures. Mark, the disciple of Peter, begins his gospel thus:-\"The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, as it is written in the prophet Isaiah: Behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee. The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.\"[fn-23-P2377_607038:1696-nf] This quotation is made up from two prophets, Malachi that is to say and Isaiah. For the first part: \"Behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee,\" occurs at the close of Malachi.[fn-23-P2378_607286:1697-nf] But the second part: \"The voice of one crying, etc.,\" we read in Isaiah.[fn-23-P2379_607381:1698-nf] On what grounds then has Mark in the very beginning of his book set the words: \"As it is written in the prophet Isaiah, Behold I send my messenger,\" when, as we have said, it is not written in Isaiah at all, but in Malachi the last of the twelve prophets? Let ignorant presumption solve this nice question if it can, and I will ask pardon for being in the wrong. The same Mark brings before us the Saviour thus addressing the Pharisees: \"Have ye never read what David did when he had need and was an hungred, he and they that were with him, how he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the highpriest, and did eat the shew-bread which is not lawful to eat but for the priests?\"[fn-23-P2380_608094:1699-nf] Now let us turn to the books of Samuel, or, as they are commonly called, of Kings, and we shall find there that the highpriest's name was not Abiathar but Ahimelech,[fn-23-P2381_608295:1700-nf] the same that was afterwards put to death with the rest of the priests by Doeg at the command of Saul.[fn-23-P2382_608422:1701-nf] Let us pass on now to the apostle Paul who writes thus to the Corinthians: \"For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. But, as it is written, Eye hath not seen nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him.\"[fn-23-P2383_608759:1702-nf] Some writers on this passage betake themselves to the ravings of the apocryphal books and assert that the quotation comes from the Revelation of Elijah;[fn-23-P2384_608949:1703-nf] whereas the truth is that it is found in Isaiah according to the Hebrew text: \"Since the beginning of the world men have not heard nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee what thou hast prepared for them that wait for thee.\"[fn-23-P2385_609298:1704-nf] The Septuagint has rendered the words quite differently: \"Since the beginning of the world we have not heard, neither have our eyes seen any God beside thee and thy true works, and thou wilt shew mercy to them that wait for thee.\" We see then from what place the quotation is taken and yet the apostle has not rendered his original word for word, but, using a paraphrase, he has given the sense in different terms. In his epistle to the Romans the same apostle quotes these words from Isaiah: \"Behold I lay in Sion a stumbling-stone and rock of offence,\"[fn-23-P2386_609945:1705-nf] a rendering which is at variance with the Greek version[fn-23-P2387_610023:1706-nf] yet agrees with the original Hebrew. The Septuagint gives an opposite meaning, \"that you fall not on a stumblingstone nor on a rock of offence.\" The apostle Peter agrees with Paul and the Hebrew, writing: \"but to them that do not believe, a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence.\"[fn-23-P2388_610347:1707-nf] From all these passages it is clear that the apostles and evangelists in translating the old testament scriptures have sought to give the meaning rather than the words, and that they have not greatly cared to preserve forms or constructions, so long as they could make clear the subject to the understanding.","index":"700","references":[{"fn":"23","code":"P2377_607038","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Mark i. 1-3; see RV.","bible_refs":[{"book":"mark","chapter":1,"verses":[1]},{"book":"mark","chapter":1,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"23","code":"P2378_607286","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Mal. iii. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"malachi","chapter":3,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"23","code":"P2379_607381","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Isa. xl. 3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":40,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"23","code":"P2380_608094","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Mark ii. 25, Mark ii. 26.","bible_refs":[{"book":"mark","chapter":2,"verses":[25]},{"book":"mark","chapter":2,"verses":[26]}]},{"fn":"23","code":"P2381_608295","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1 Sam. xxi. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 samuel","chapter":21,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"23","code":"P2382_608422","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1 Sam. xxii. 16-18.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 samuel","chapter":22,"verses":[16]}]},{"fn":"23","code":"P2383_608759","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1 Cor. ii. 8, 1 Cor. ii. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":2,"verses":[8]}]},{"fn":"23","code":"P2384_608949","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"This book is no longer extant.

And in the same book we read that, after his return from Mesopotamia with his wives and his sons, Jacob pitched his tent before Salem, a city of Shechem which is in the land of Canaan, and that he dwelt there and \"bought a parcel of a field where he had spread his tent at the band of Hamor, the father of Sychem, for an hundred lambs,\"[fn-23-P2395_611805:1713-nf] and that \"he erected there an altar and called there upon the God of Israel.\"[fn-23-P2396_611902:1714-nf] Abraham does not buy the cave from Hamor the father of Sychem, but from Ephron the son of Zohar, and he is not buried in Sychem but in Hebron which is corruptly called Arboch. Whereas the twelve patriarchs are not buried in Arboch but in Sychem, in the field purchased not by Abraham but by Jacob. I postpone the solution of this delicate problem to enable those who cavil at me to search and see that in dealing with the scriptures it is the sense we have to look to and not the words.

But how shall we deal with the Hebrew originals in which these passages and others like them are omitted, passages so numerous that to reproduce them all would require books without number?

The letter begins !Edei hma, agapphte, mh oihsei twn klhrwn feresqai which I remember to have rendered as follows: \"Dearly beloved, we ought not to misuse our position as ministers to gratify our pride.\" See there, they cry, what a number of falsehoods in a single line! In the first place agaphtoj means `loved,' not `dearly beloved.' Then oihsij means `estimate,' not `pride,' for this and not oidhma is the word used.

He who declares that he imitates the style of apostles should first imitate the virtue of their lives; the great holiness of which made up for much plainness of speech. They confuted the syllogisms of Aristotle and the perverse ingenuities of Chrysippus by raising the dead. Still it would be absurd for one of us-living as we do amid the riches of Croesus and the luxuries of Sardanapalus-to make his boast of mere ignorance.

Had the scenes of the Passion and of the Resurrection been elsewhere than in a populous city with court and garrison, with prostitutes, playactors, and buffoons, and with the medley of persons usually found in such centres; or had the crowds which thronged it been composed of monks; then a city would be a desirable abode for those who have embraced the monastic life. But, as things are, it would be the height of folly first to renounce the world, to forswear one's country, to forsake cities, to profess one's self a monk; and then to live among still greater numbers the same kind of life that you would have lived in your own country.

And, to come to our own case, let bishops and presbyters take for their examples the apostles or their companions; and as they hold the rank which these once held, let them endeavour to exhibit the same excellence.

Still we may approve these things as the swathing bands of an infant faith. He who has been a loyal soldier under a strange banner is sure to deserve the laurel when he comes to serve his own king. When Nepotian laid aside his baldrick and changed his dress, he bestowed upon the poor all the pay that he had received. For he had read the words: \"if thou wilt be perfect, sell that thou hast, and give to the poor and follow me,\"[fn-25-P2585_662084:1852-nf] and again: \"ye cannot serve two masters, God and Mammon.\"[fn-25-P2586_662166:1853-nf] He kept nothing for himself but a common tunic and cloak to cover him and to keep out the cold. Made in the fashion of his province his attire was not remarkable either for elegance or for squalor. He burned daily to make his way to the monasteries of Egypt, or to visit the communities of Mesopotamia, or at least to live a lonely life in the Dalmatian islands,[fn-25-P2587_662552:1854-nf] separated from the mainland only by the strait of Altinum. But he had not the heart to forsake his episcopal uncle in whom he beheld a pattern of many virtues and from whom he could take lessons without going abroad. In one and the same person he both found a monk to imitate and a bishop to revere. What so often happens did not happen here. Constant intimacy did not produce familiarity, nor did familiarity breed contempt. He revered him as a father and every day admired him for some new virtue. To be brief, he became a clergyman, and after passing through the usual stages was ordained a presbyter. Good Jesus! how he sighed and groaned! how he fasted and fled the eyes of all! For the first and only time he was angry with his uncle, complaining that the burthen laid upon him was too heavy for him and that his youth unfitted him for the priesthood. But the more he struggled against it, the more he drew to himself the hearts of all: his refusal did but prove him worthy of an office which he was reluctant to assume, and all the more worthy because he declared himself unworthy. We too in our day have our Timothy; we too have seen that wisdom which is as good as gray hairs;[fn-25-P2588_663778:1855-nf] our Moses has chosen an elder whom he has known to be an eider indeed.[fn-25-P2589_663871:1856-nf] Nepotian regarded the clerical state less as an honour than a burthen. He made it his first care to silence envy by humility, and his next to give no cause for scandal that such as assailed his youth might marvel at his continence. He helped the poor, visited the sick, stirred men up to hospitality, soothed them with soft words, rejoiced with those who rejoiced and wept with those who wept.[fn-25-P2590_664389:1857-nf] He was a staff to the blind, food to the hungry, hope to the dejected, consolation to the bereaved. Each single virtue was as conspicuous in him as if he possessed no other. Among his fellow-presbyters while ever foremost in work, he was ever satisfied with the lowest place. Any good that he did he ascribed to his uncle: but if the result did not correspond to his expectations, he would say that his uncle knew nothing of it, that it was his own mistake. In public he recognized him as a bishop; at home he looked upon him as a father. The seriousness of his disposition was mitigated by a cheerful expression. But while his laughter was joyous it was never loud. Christ's virgins and widows he honoured as mothers and exhorted as sisters \"with all purity.\"[fn-25-P2591_665173:1858-nf] When he returned home he used to leave the clergyman outside and to give himself over to the hard rule of a monk. Frequent in supplication and watchful in prayer he would offer his tears not to man but to God. His fasts he regulated-as a driver does the pace of his horses-according to the weariness or vigour of his body. When at his uncle's table he would just taste what was set before him, so as to avoid superstition and yet to preserve self-control. In conversing at entertainments his habit was to propose some topic from scripture, to listen modestly, to answer diffidently, to support the right, to refute the wrong, but both without bitterness; to instruct his opponent rather than to vanquish him. Such was the ingenuous modesty which adorned his youth that he would frankly confess from what sources his several arguments came; and in this way, while disclaiming a reputation for learning, he came to be held most learned. This he would say is the opinion of Tertullian, that of Cyprian; this of Lactantius, that of Hilary; to this effect speaks Minucius Felix, thus Victorinus, after this manner Arnobius. Myself too he would sometimes quote, for he loved me because of my intimacy with his uncle. Indeed by constant reading and long-continued meditation he had made his breast a library of Christ.","index":"749","references":[{"fn":"25","code":"P2585_662084","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Matt. xix. 21.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":19,"verses":[21]}]},{"fn":"25","code":"P2586_662166","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Matt. vi. 24.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":6,"verses":[24]}]},{"fn":"25","code":"P2587_662552","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Like Bonosus (Letter III. 4).","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"25","code":"P2588_663778","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Wisd. iv. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"wisdom","chapter":4,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"25","code":"P2589_663871","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Nu. xi. 16.

An office which was once handed down from patrician to patrician, which only men of noble birth could hold, of which the consul Marius-victor though he was over Numidia and the Teutons and the Cimbri-was held unworthy on account of the obscurity of his family, and which Scipio won before his time as the reward of valour,-this great office is now obtained by merely belonging to the army; and the shining robe of victory[fn-27-P2746_719742:1946-nf] now envelops men who a little while ago were country boors.

The disciple of Christ must do more for the attainment of spiritual glory than the philosopher of the world, than the venal slave of flying rumours and of the people's breath. It is not enough for you to despise wealth unless you follow Christ as well. And only he follows Christ who forsakes his sins and walks hand in hand with virtue. We know that Christ is wisdom.

My reverend son Heraclius the deacon has reported to me that in your eagerness to see me you came as far as Cissa, and that, though a Pannonian and consequently a land animal, you did not quail before the surges of the Adriatic and the dangers of the Aegean and Ionian seas. He tells me that you would have actually accomplished your purpose, had not our brethren with affectionate care held you back. I thank you all the same and regard it as a kindness shewn. For in the case of friends one must accept the will for the deed. Enemies often give us the latter, but only sincere attachment can bring us the former. And now that I am writing to you I beseech you do not regard the bodily affliction which has befallen you as due to sin. When the Apostles speculated concerning the man that was born blind from the womb and asked our Lord and Saviour: \"Who did sin, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?\" they were told \"Neither hath this man sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.\"[fn-28-P2812_738229:1996-nf] Do we not see numbers of heathens, Jews, heretics and men of various opinions rolling in the mire of lust, bathed in blood, surpassing wolves in ferocity and kites in rapacity, and for all this the plague does not come nigh their dwellings?[fn-28-P2813_738503:1997-nf] They are not smitten as other men, and accordingly they wax insolent against God and lift up their faces even to heaven. We know on the other hand that holy men are afflicted with sicknesses, miseries, and want, and perhaps they are tempted to say \"Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.\" Yet immediately they go on to reprove themselves, \"If I say, I will speak thus; behold I should offend against the generation of thy children.\"[fn-28-P2814_738995:1998-nf] If you suppose that your blindness is caused by sin, and that a disease which physicians are often able to cure is an evidence of God's anger, you will think Isaac a sinner because he was so wholly sightless that he was deceived into blessing one whom he did not mean to bless.[fn-28-P2815_739314:1999-nf] You will charge Jacob with sin, whose vision became so dim that he could not see Ephraim and Manasseh,[fn-28-P2816_739438:2000-nf] although with the inner eye and the prophetic spirit he could foresee the distant future and the Christ that was to come of his royal line.[fn-28-P2817_739604:2001-nf] Were any of the kings holier than Josiah?

At first Didymus was ashamed to answer, but when the question had been repeated a second time and a third, he frankly confessed that his blindness was a great grief to him.

What else is this but to say that Christ has died in vain? He has indeed died in vain if there are any whom He cannot make alive. When John the Baptist points to Christ and says: \"Behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sins[fn-28-P2837_744819:2015-nf] of the world\"[fn-28-P2838_744855:2016-nf] he utters a falsehood if after all there are persons living whose sins Christ has not taken away. For either it must be shewn that they are not of the world whom the grace of Christ thus ignores: or, if it be admitted that they are of the world, we have to choose between the horns of a dilemma. Either they have been delivered from their sins, in which case the power of Christ to save all men is proved; or they remain undelivered and as it were still under the charge of misdoing, in which case Christ is proved to be powerless.

To what does all this tend, you ask. I reply; you remember the question that you proposed. It was this. A Spanish bishop named Carterius, old in years and in the priesthood has married two wives, one before he was baptized, and, she having died, another since he has passed through the laver; and you are of opinion that he has violated the precept of the apostle, who in his list of episcopal qualifications commands that a bishop shall be \"the husband of one wife.\"[fn-28-P2843_746501:2020-nf] I am surprised that you have pilloriedan individual when the whole world is filled with persons ordained in similar circumstances; I do not mean presbyters or clergy of lower rank, but speak only of bishops of whom if I were to enumerate them all one by one I should gather a sufficient number to surpass the crowd which attended the synod of Ariminum.[fn-28-P2844_746878:2021-nf] Still it does not become me to defend one by incriminating many; nor if reason condemns a sin, to make the number of those who commit it an excuse for it. At Rome an eloquent pleader caught me, as the phrase goes, between the horns of a dilemma: whichever way I turned I was held fast. Is it sinful, said he, to marry a wife, or is it not sinful? I in my simplicity, not being wary enough to avoid the snare laid for me, replied that it was not sinful. Then he propounded another question: Is it good deeds which are done away with in baptism or is it evil? Here again my simplicity induced me to say that it was sins which were forgiven. At this point, just as I began to fancy myself secure, the horns of the dilemma commenced to close in on me from this side and from that and their points hidden before began to shew themselves. If, said he, to marry a wife is not sinful, and if baptism forgives sins, all that is not done away with is held over. On the instant a dark mist rose before my eyes as though I had been struck by a strong boxer. Yet recalling the sophism attributed to Chrysippus:[fn-28-P2845_748197:2022-nf] \"Whether you lie or whether you speak the truth, in either case you lie,\" I came to myself again and turned upon my opponent with a dilemma of my own. Pray tell me, I said, does baptism make a new man or does it not? He grudgingly admitted that it did. I pursued my advantage by saying. Does it make him wholly new or only partially so? He replied, Wholly. Then I asked, Is there nothing then of the old man held over in baptism? He assented. Hereupon I propounded the argument; If baptism makes a man new and creates a wholly new being, and if there is nothing of the old man held over in the new, that which once was in the old cannot be imputed to the new. At first my thorny friend held his tongue; afterwards however, making Piso's mistake,[fn-28-P2846_748979:2023-nf] though he had nothing to say he could not remain silent. Sweat stood upon Iris brow, his cheeks turned pale, his lips trembled, his tongue clove to his mouth, his throat became dry; and fear (not age) made him cower. At last he broke out in these words, Have you not read how the apostle permits none to be ordained priest save the husband of one wife, and that what he lays stress upon is the fact of the marriage and not the time at which it is contracted? Now as the fellow had challenged me with syllogisms, and as I saw that he was feeling his way towards some intricate and awkward questions, I proceeded to turn his own weapons against him. I said therefore, Whom did the apostle select for the episcopate, baptized persons or catechumens? He refused to reply. I however made a fresh onslaught repeating my question a second time and a third. You would have taken him for Niobe changed to stone by excessive weeping. I turned to the audience and said: It is all the same to me, good people, whether I bind my opponent awake or sleeping; but it is easier to fetter a man who offers no resistance. If those whom the apostle admits into the ranks of the clergy are not catechumens but the faithful, and if he who is ordained bishop is always one of the faithful, being one of the faithful he cannot have the faults of a catechumen imputed to him. Such were the darts I hurled at my paralysed opponent. Such the quivering spears I cast at him. At last his mouth opened and he vomited forth the contents of his mind. Certainly, he blurted out, that is the doctrine of the apostle Paul.","index":"830","references":[{"fn":"28","code":"P2843_746501","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1 Tim. iii. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 timothy","chapter":3,"verses":[2]}]},{"fn":"28","code":"P2844_746878","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"This synod held in 359 a.d. was attended by about 450 bishops.

In the first is the following passage: \"If a man desire the office of a bishop he desireth a good work. A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach, not given to wine, no striker ...but patient, not a brawler, not covetous; one that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity. (For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?) Not a novice lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condenmation of the devil. Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.\"[fn-28-P2848_751398:2024-nf] While immediately at the commencement of the epistle to Titus the following behests are laid down: \"For this cause left I thee in Crete that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee: if any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly. For a bishop must be blameless as the steward of God; not self-willed, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre; but a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate; holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able bysound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.\"[fn-28-P2849_752146:2025-nf] In both epistles commandment is given that only monogamists should, be chosen for the clerical office whether as bishops or as presbyters.[fn-28-P2850_752307:2026-nf] Indeed with the ancients these names were synonymous, one alluding to the office, the other to the age of the clergy. No one at any rate can doubt that the apostle is speaking only of those who have been baptized. If therefore it in no wise prejudices the case of one who is to be ordained bishop that before his baptism he has not possessed all the requisite qualifications (for it is asked what he is and not what he has been), why should a previous marriage-the one thing which is in itself not sinful-prove a hindrance to his ordination? You argue that as his marriage was not a sin it was not done away with at his baptism. This is news to me indeed, that what in itself was not a sin is to be reckoned as such. All fornication and contamination with open vice, impiety towards God, parricide and incest, the change of the natural use of the sexes into that which is against nature[fn-28-P2851_753230:2027-nf] and all extraordinary lusts are washed away in the fountain of Christ. Can it be possible that the stains of marriage are indelible, and that harlotry is judged more leniently than honourable wedlock?

Tell this to the heathen who form the church's harvest with which she stores her granaries; tell this to the catechumens who seek admission to the number of the faithful; tell them, I say, not to contract marriages before their baptism, not to enter upon honourable wedlock, but like the Scots and the Atacotti[fn-28-P2853_754205:2029-nf] and the people of Plato's republic[fn-28-P2854_754319:2030-nf] to have community of wives and no discrimination of children, nay more, to beware of any semblance even of matrimony; lest, after they have come to believe in Christ, He shall tell them that those whom they have had have not been concubines or mistresses but wedded wives.","index":"831","references":[{"fn":"28","code":"P2848_751398","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1 Tim. iii. 1-7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 timothy","chapter":3,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"28","code":"P2849_752146","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Tit. i. 5-9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"titus","chapter":1,"verses":[5]}]},{"fn":"28","code":"P2850_752307","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Rendered `elders\f0' in AV.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"28","code":"P2851_753230","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Cf.

The Lord, you say, has not forgiven because He had nothingto forgive; yet because He has not forgiven, that which has not been forgiven still remains.","index":"832","references":[{"fn":"28","code":"P2856_755013","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Matt. vii. 5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":7,"verses":[5]}]},{"fn":"28","code":"P2857_755201","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Matt. xxiii. 23, Matt. xxiii. 24, RV.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":23,"verses":[23]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":23,"verses":[24]}]},{"fn":"28","code":"P2858_755981","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Gen. i. 28.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":1,"verses":[28]}]},{"fn":"28","code":"P2859_756354","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Heb. xiii. 4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"hebrews","chapter":13,"verses":[4]}]},{"fn":"28","code":"P2860_756446","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1 Cor. iii. 17, RV.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":3,"verses":[17]}]},{"fn":"28","code":"P2861_756811","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1 Cor. vi. 11.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":6,"verses":[11]}]}]},{"text":" 5. What the true effect of baptism is, and what is the real grace conveyed by water hallowed in Christ, I will presently tell you; meantime I will deal with this argument as it deserves. `An ill knot,' says the common proverb, `requires but an ill wedge to split it.' The text quoted by the objector, \"a bishop must be the husband of one wife,\" admits of quite another explanation. The apostlecame of the Jews and the primitive Christian church was gathered out of the remnants of Israel. Paul knew that the Law allowed men to have children by several wives,[fn-28-P2863_758060:2037-nf] and was aware that the example of the patriarchs had made polygamy familiar to the people. Even the very priests might at their own discretion enjoy the same license.[fn-28-P2864_758249:2038-nf] He gave commandment therefore that the priests of the church should not claim this liberty, that they should not take two wives or three together, but that they should each have but one wife at one time. Perhaps you may say that this explanation which I have given is disputed; in that case listen to another. You must not have a monopoly of bending the Law to suit your will instead of bending your will to suit the Law. Some by a strained interpretation say that wives are in this passage to be taken for churches and husbands for their bishops. A decree was made by the fathers assembled at the council of Nicaea[fn-28-P2865_758901:2039-nf] that no bishop should be translated from one church to another, lest scorning the society of a poor yet virgin see he should seek the embraces of a wealthy and adulterous one. For as the word logismoi, that is, \"disputings,\" refers to the fault and misdoing of sons in the faith,[fn-28-P2866_759200:2040-nf] and as the precept concerning the management of a house refers to the right direction of body and of soul,[fn-28-P2867_759344:2041-nf] so by the wives of the bishops we are to understand their churches. Concerning whom it is written in Isaiah, \"Make haste ye women and come from the show, for it is a people of no understanding.\"[fn-28-P2868_759563:2042-nf] And again \"Rise up, ye women that are wealthy,[fn-28-P2869_759664:2043-nf] and hear my voice.\"[fn-28-P2870_759715:2044-nf] And in the Book of Proverbs, \"Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies. The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her.\"[fn-28-P2871_759887:2045-nf] In the same book too it is written, \"Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands.\"[fn-28-P2872_760052:2046-nf] Nor does this, say they, derogate from the dignity of the episcopate; for the same figure is used in relation to God. Jeremiah writes: \"As a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel.\"[fn-28-P2873_760323:2047-nf] And the apostle employs the same comparison: \"I have espoused you,\" he says to his converts, \"to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.\"[fn-28-P2874_760510:2048-nf] The word woman is in the Greek ambiguous and should in all these places be understood as meaning wife. You will say that this interpretation is harsh and does violence to the sense. In that case give back to the scripture its simple meaning and save me from the necessity of fighting you on your own ground.[fn-28-P2875_760842:2049-nf] I will ask you the following question, Can a man who before his baptism has kept a concubine, and after her death has received baptism and has taken a wife, become a clergyman or not? You will answer me that he can, because his first partner was a concubine and not a wife. What the apostle condemns then, it would seem, is not mere sexual intercourse but marriage contracts and conjugal rights. Many persons, we see, because of narrow circumstances refuse to take upon them the burthen of matrimony. Instead of taking wives they live with their maid-servants and bring up as their own the children which these bear to them. Thus, if through the bounty of the Emperor they gain for their mistresses the right of wearing a matron's robes,[fn-28-P2876_761628:2050-nf] they will at once come beneath the yoke of the apostle and sorely against their will will have to receive their partners as their wedded wives. But, if their poverty prevents them from obtaining an imperial rescript such as I have mentioned, the decrees of the Church will vary with the laws of Rome. Be careful therefore not to interpret the words \"the husband of one wife,\" that is, of one woman, as approving indiscriminate intercourse and condemning only contracts of marriage.","index":"833","references":[{"fn":"28","code":"P2863_758060","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Ex. xxi. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"exodus","chapter":21,"verses":[10]}]},{"fn":"28","code":"P2864_758249","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Lev. xxi. 7, Lev. xxi. 13.","bible_refs":[{"book":"leviticus","chapter":21,"verses":[7]},{"book":"leviticus","chapter":21,"verses":[13]}]},{"fn":"28","code":"P2865_758901","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Canon xv.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"28","code":"P2866_759200","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Cf.

Let me now fulfil the promise I made a little while ago and with all the skill of a rhetorician sing the praises of water and of baptism. In the beginning the earth was without form and void, there was no dazzling sun or pale moon, there were no glittering stars. There was nothing but matter inorganic and invisible, and even this was lost in abysmal depths and shrouded in a distorting gloom. The Spirit of God above moved, as a charioteer, over the face of the waters,[fn-28-P2879_762983:2051-nf] and produced from them the infant world, a type of the Christian child that is drawn from the laver of baptism. A firmament is constructed between heaven and earth, and to this is allotted the name heaven,-in the Hebrew Shamayim or `what comes out of the waters,'-[fn-28-P2880_763268:2052-nf] and the waters which are above the heavens are parted from the others to the praise of God. Wherefore also in the vision of the prophet Ezekiel there is seen above the cherubim a crystal stretched forth,[fn-28-P2881_763585:2053-nf] that is, the compressed and denser waters. The first living beings come out of the waters; and believers soar out of the layer with wings to heaven. Man is formed out of clay[fn-28-P2882_763782:2054-nf] and God holds the mystic waters in the hollow of his hand.[fn-28-P2883_763862:2055-nf] In Eden a garden[fn-28-P2884_763944:2056-nf] is planted, and a fountain in the midst of it parts into four heads.[fn-28-P2885_764033:2057-nf] This is the same fountain which Ezekiel later on describes as issuing out of the temple and flowing towards the rising of the sun, until it heals the bitter waters and quickens those that are dead.[fn-28-P2886_764265:2058-nf] When the world falls into sin nothing but a flood of waters can cleanse it again. But as soon as the foul bird of wickedness is driven away, the dove of the Holy Spirit comes to Noah[fn-28-P2887_764489:2059-nf] as it came afterwards to Christ in the Jordan,[fn-28-P2888_764574:2060-nf] and, carrying ill its beak a branch betokening restoration and light, brings tidings of peace to the whole world. Pharaoh and his host, loth to allow God's people to leave Egypt, are overwhelmed in the Red Sea figuring thereby our baptism. His destruction is thus described in the book of Psalms: \"Thou didst endow the sea with virtue through thy power: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters: thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces.\"[fn-28-P2889_765053:2061-nf] For this reason adders and scorpions haunt dry places[fn-28-P2890_765139:2062-nf] and whenever they come near water behave as if rabid or insane.[fn-28-P2891_765228:2063-nf] As wood sweetens Marah so that seventy palm-trees are watered by its streams, so the cross makes the waters of the law lifegiving to the seventy who are Christ's apostles.[fn-28-P2892_765444:2064-nf] It is Abraham and Isaac who dig wells, the Philistines who try to prevent them.[fn-28-P2893_765561:2065-nf] Beersheba too, the city of the oath,[fn-28-P2894_765637:2066-nf] and [Gihon], the scene of Solomon's coronation,[fn-28-P2895_765708:2067-nf] derive their names from springs. It is beside a well that Eliezer finds Rebekah.[fn-28-P2896_765833:2068-nf] Rachel too is a drawer of water and wins a kiss thereby[fn-28-P2897_765928:2069-nf] from the supplanter[fn-28-P2898_765987:2070-nf] Jacob.

Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity.\"[fn-29-P2921_769527:2092-nf] It would seem that we must add something to this song and say \"Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not a wife.\" Let us hear also the declaration which Ezekiel the so called\"son of man\"[fn-29-P2922_769746:2093-nf] makes concerning the virtueof him who is to be the true son of man, theChristian: \"I will take you,\" he says, \"from among the heathen ...then will I sprinkleclean water upon you, and ye shall be cleanfrom all your filthinessa new heart also will I give you and a new spirit.\"[fn-29-P2923_770042:2094-nf] \"From all your filthiness\" he says, \"will I cleanse you.\" If all is taken away nothing can be left. If filthiness is cleansed, how much more is cleanness kept from defilement. \"A new heart also will I give you and a new spirit.\" Yes, for \"in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but a new nature.\"[fn-29-P2924_770431:2095-nf] Wherefore the song also which we sing is a new song,[fn-29-P2925_770550:2096-nf] and putting off the old man[fn-29-P2926_770600:2097-nf] we walk not in the oldness of the letter but in the newness of the spirit.[fn-29-P2927_770697:2098-nf] This is the new stone wherein the new name is written, \"which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.\"[fn-29-P2928_770826:2099-nf] \"Know ye not,\" says the apostle, \"that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.\"[fn-29-P2929_771147:2100-nf] Do we read so often of newness and of making new and yet can no renewing efface the stain which the word wife brings with it? We are buried with Christ by baptism and we have risen again by faith in the working of God who hath called Him from the dead. And \"when we were dead in our sins and in the uncircumcision of our flesh, God hath quickened us together with Him, having forgiven us all trespasses; blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way nailing it to His cross.\"[fn-29-P2930_771727:2101-nf] Can it be that when our whole being is dead with Christ and when all the sins noted down in the old \"handwriting\" are blotted out, the one word \"wife\" alone lives on? Time would fail me were I to try to lay before you in order all the passages in the Holy Scriptures which relate to the efficacy of baptism or to explain the mysterious doctrine of that second birth which though it is our second is yet our first in Christ.","index":"836","references":[{"fn":"29","code":"P2921_769527","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Ps. xxxii. 1-2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":32,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"29","code":"P2922_769746","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Ezek. ii. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"ezekiel","chapter":2,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"29","code":"P2923_770042","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Ezek. xxxvi. 24-26.

Before I make an end of dictating (for I perceive that I have already exceeded the just limits of a letter) I wish to give a brief explanation of the previous verses of the epistle in which the apostle describes the life of him that is to be made a bishop. We shall thus recognize him as Doctor of the Nations[fn-29-P2932_772499:2102-nf] not only for his praise of monogamy but also for all his precepts. At the same time I beg that no one will suppose that in what I write my design is to blacken the priests of the present day. My one object is to promote the interest of the church. Just as orators and philosophers in giving their notions of the perfect orator and the perfect philosopher do not detract from Demosthenes and Plato but merely set forth abstract ideals; so, when I describe a bishop and explain the qualifications laid down for the episcopate, I am but supplying a mirror for priests. Every man's conscience will tell him that it rests with himself what image he will see reflected there, whether one that will grieve him by its deformity or one that will gladden him by its beauty. I turn now to the passage in question.[fn-29-P2933_773327:2103-nf] \"If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good, work.\" Work, you see, not rank; toil not pleasure; work that he may increase in lowliness, not grow proud by reason of elevation. \"A bishop then must be blameless.\" The same thing that he says to Titus, \"if any be blameless.\"[fn-29-P2934_773640:2104-nf] All the virtues are comprehended in this one word; thus he seems to require an impossible perfection. For if every sin, even every idle word, is deserving of blame, who is there in this world that is sinless and blameless? Still he who is chosen to be shepherd of the church must be one compared with whom other men are rightly regarded as but a flock of sheep. Rhetoricians define an orator as a good man able to speak. To be worthy of so high an honour he must be blameless in life and lip. For a teacher loses all his influence whose words are rendered null by his deeds. \"The husband of one wife.\" Concerning this requirement I have spoken above. I will now only warn you that If monogamy is insisted on before baptism the other conditions laid down must be insisted on before baptism too. For it is impossible to regard the remaining obligations as binding only on the baptized and this alone as binding also on the unbaptized. \"Vigilant (or \"temperate\" for nhfalioj means both) wise,[fn-29-P2935_774650:2105-nf] of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach.\" The priests who minister in God's temple are forbidden to drink wine and strong drink,[fn-29-P2936_774817:2106-nf] to keep their wits from being stupefied with drunkenness and to enable their understanding to do its duty in God's service. By the word `wise' those are excluded who plead simplicity as an excuse for a priest's folly. For if the brain be not sound, all the members will be amiss. The phrase \"of good behaviour\" is an extension of the previous epithet \"blameless.\" One who has no faults is called \"blameless;\"one who is rich in virtues is said to be \"of good behaviour.\" Or the words may be differently explained in accord with Tully's maxim,[fn-29-P2937_775379:2107-nf] `the main thing is that what you do you should do gracefully.' For some persons are so ignorant of their own measure[fn-29-P2938_775523:2108-nf] and so stupid and foolish that they make themselves laughing stocks to those who see them because of their gesture or gait or dress or conversation. Fancying that they knew what is and what is not good taste they deck themselves out with finery and bodily adornments and give banquets which profess to be elegant: but all such attempts at dress and display are nastier than a beggar's rags. As regards the obligation of priests to be teachers we bare the precepts of the old Law[fn-29-P2939_776029:2109-nf] and the fuller instructions given on the subject to Titus.[fn-29-P2940_776117:2110-nf] For an innocent and unobtrusive conversation does as much harm by its silence as it does good by its example. If the ravening wolves are to be frightened away it must be by the barking of dogs and by the staff of the shepherd. \"Not given to wine, no striker.\" With the virtues they are to aim at he contrasts the vices they are to avoid.","index":"837","references":[{"fn":"29","code":"P2932_772499","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Doctor Gentium.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"29","code":"P2933_773327","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1 Tim. iii. 1-7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 timothy","chapter":3,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"29","code":"P2934_773640","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Tit. i. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"titus","chapter":1,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"29","code":"P2935_774650","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"AV. `sober.\f0'","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"29","code":"P2936_774817","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Lev. x. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"leviticus","chapter":10,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"29","code":"P2937_775379","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Cic. de Or. i 29.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"29","code":"P2938_775523","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Cf. 2 Cor. x. 14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":10,"verses":[14]}]},{"fn":"29","code":"P2939_776029","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Cf.

We have learned what we ought to be: let us now learn what priests ought not to be Indulgence in wine is the fault of diners out and revellers. When the body is heated with drink it soon boils over with lust. Wine drinking means self-indulgence, self-indulgence means sensual gratification, sensual gratification means a breach of chastity. He that lives in pleasure is dead while he lives,[fn-29-P2942_776871:2111-nf] and he that drinks himself drunk is not only dead but buried. One hour's debauch makes Noah uncover his nakedness which through sixty years of sobriety he had kept covered.[fn-29-P2943_777070:2112-nf] Lot in a fit of intoxication unwittingly adds incest to incontinence, and wine overcomes the man whom Sodom failed to conquer.[fn-29-P2944_777232:2113-nf] A bishop that is a striker is condemned by Him who gave His back to the smiters,[fn-29-P2945_777339:2114-nf] and when He was reviled reviled not again.[fn-29-P2946_777402:2115-nf] \"But moderate\";[fn-29-P2947_777442:2116-nf] one good thing is set over against two evil things. Drunkenness and passion are to be held in check by moderation. \"Not a brawler, not covetous.\" Nothing is more overweening than the assurance of the ignorant who fancy that incessant chatter will carry conviction with it and are always ready for a dispute that they may thunder with turgid eloquence against the flock committed to their charge. That a priest must avoid covetousness even Samuel teaches when he proves before all the people that he has taken nothing from any man.[fn-29-P2948_778000:2117-nf] And the same lesson is taught by the poverty of the apostles who used to receive sustenance and refreshment from their brethren and to boast that they neither had nor wished to have anything besides food and raiment.[fn-29-P2949_778243:2118-nf] What the epistle to Timothy calls covetousness, that to Titus openly censures as the desire for filthy lucre.[fn-29-P2950_778380:2119-nf] \"One that ruleth well his own house.\" Not by increasing riches, not by providing regal banquets, not by having a pile of finely-wrought plates, not by slowly steaming pheasants so that the heat may reach the bones without melting the flesh upon them; no, but by first requiring of his own household the conduct which he has to inculcate in others. \"Having his children in subjection with all gravity.\" They must not, that is, follow the example of the sons of Eli who lay with the women in the vestibule of the Temple and, supposing religion to consist in plunder, diverted to the gratification of their own appetites all the best parts of the victims.[fn-29-P2951_779053:2120-nf] \"Not a novice lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.\" I cannot sufficiently express my amazement at the great blindness which makes men discuss such questions as that of marriage before baptism and causes them to charge people with a transaction which is dead in baptism, nay even quickened into a new life with Christ, while no one regards a commandment so clear and unmistakable as this about bishops not being novices. One who was yesterday a catechumen is to-day a bishop[fn-29-P2952_779608:2121-nf] ; one who was yesterday in the amphitheatre is to-day in the church; one who spent the evening in the circus stands in the morning at the altar: one who a little while ago was a patron of actors is now a dedicator of virgins. Was the apostle ignorant of our shifts and subterfuges? did he know nothing of our foolish arguments? He not only says that a bishop must be the husband of one wife, but he has given commandment that he must be blameless, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach, moderate,[fn-29-P2953_780168:2122-nf] not given to wine, no striker, not a brawler, not covetous, not a novice. Yet to all these requirements we shut our eyes and notice nothing but the wives of the aspirants. Who cannot give instances to shew the need of the warning: \"lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil?\" A priest[fn-29-P2954_780512:2123-nf] who is made such in a moment knows nothing of the lowliness and meekness which mark the meanest of the faithful, he knows nothing of Christian courtesy, he is not wise enough to think little of himself. He passes from one dignity to another, yet he has not fasted, he has not wept, he has not taken himself to task for his life, he has not striven by constant meditation to amend it, he has not given his substance to the poor. Yet he is moved from one see[fn-29-P2955_781016:2124-nf] to another, he passes, that is, from pride to pride. There can be no doubt that arrogance is what the Apostle means when he speaks of the condemnation and downfall of the devil. And all men fall into this who are in a moment made masters, actually before they are disciples. \"Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without.\" The last requirement is like the first. One who is really \"blameless\" obtains the unanimous approval not only of his own household but of outsiders as well. By aliens and persons outside the church we are to understand Jews, heretics and Gentiles. A Christian bishop then must be such that they who cavil at his religion may not venture to cavil at his life. At present however we see but too many bishops who are willing, like the charioteers in the horse races, to bid money for the popular applause; while there are some so universally hated that they can wring no money from their people, a feat which clowns accomplish by means of a few gestures.","index":"838","references":[{"fn":"29","code":"P2942_776871","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Cf. 1 Tim. v. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 timothy","chapter":5,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"29","code":"P2943_777070","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Gen. ix. 20, Gen. ix. 21.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":9,"verses":[20]},{"book":"genesis","chapter":9,"verses":[21]}]},{"fn":"29","code":"P2944_777232","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Gen. xix. 30-38.","bible_refs":[{"book":"genesis","chapter":19,"verses":[30]}]},{"fn":"29","code":"P2945_777339","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Isa. l. 6.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":50,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"29","code":"P2946_777402","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1 Pet. ii. 23.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 peter","chapter":2,"verses":[23]}]},{"fn":"29","code":"P2947_777442","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"AV. `patient.\f0'","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"29","code":"P2948_778000","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1 Sam. xii. 3-5.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 samuel","chapter":12,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"29","code":"P2949_778243","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Cf. 1 Tim. vi. 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 timothy","chapter":6,"verses":[8]}]},{"fn":"29","code":"P2950_778380","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Tit. i. 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"titus","chapter":1,"verses":[7]}]},{"fn":"29","code":"P2951_779053","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1 Sam. ii. 12-17, 1 Sam. ii. 22.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 samuel","chapter":2,"verses":[12]}]},{"fn":"29","code":"P2952_779608","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"The case of Ambrose.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"29","code":"P2953_780168","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"AV. `patient.\f0'","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"29","code":"P2954_780512","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Sacerdos: as usual a bishop is meant.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"29","code":"P2955_781016","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Lit. `chair.\f0'","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"10.

Let me now run through the list of our own writers. Did not Quadratus[fn-29-P2989_790878:2150-nf] a disciple of the apostles and bishop of the Athenian church deliver to the Emperor Hadrian (on the occasion of his visit to the Eleusinian mysteries) a treatise in defence of our religion. And so great was the admiration caused in everyone by his eminent ability that it stilled a most severe persecution. The philosopher Aristides,[fn-29-P2990_791444:2151-nf] a man of great eloquence, presented to the same Emperor an apology for the Christians composed of extracts from philosophic writers. His example was afterwards followed by Justin[fn-29-P2991_791750:2152-nf] another philosopher who delivered to Antoninus Plus and his sons[fn-29-P2992_791955:2153-nf] and to the senate a treatise Against the Gentiles, in which he defended the ignominy of the cross and preached the resurrection of Christ with all freedom. Need I speak of Melito[fn-29-P2993_792177:2154-nf] bishop of Sardis, of Apollinaris[fn-29-P2994_792298:2155-nf] chief-priest of the Church of Hierapolis, of Dionysius[fn-29-P2995_792534:2156-nf] bishop of the Corinthians, of Tatian,[fn-29-P2996_792694:2157-nf] of Bardesanes,[fn-29-P2997_792746:2158-nf] of Irenaeus[fn-29-P2998_792929:2159-nf] successor to the martyr Pothinus;[fn-29-P2999_793101:2160-nf] all of whom have in many volumes explained the uprisings of the several heresies and tracked them back, each to the philosophic source from which it flows. Pantaenus,[fn-30-P3000_793336:2161-nf] a philosopher of the Stoic school, was on account of his great reputation for learning sent by Demetrius bishop of Alexandria to India, to preach Christ to the Brahmans and philosophers there. Clement,[fn-30-P3001_793716:2162-nf] a presbyter of Alexandria, in my judgment the most learned of men, wrote eight books of Miscellanies[fn-30-P3002_793886:2163-nf] and as many of Outline Sketches,[fn-30-P3003_793940:2164-nf] a treatise against the Gentiles, and three volumes called the Pedagogue. Is there any want of learning in these, or are they not rather drawn from the very heart of philosophy? Imitating his example Origen[fn-30-P3004_794168:2165-nf] wrote ten books of Miscellanies, in which he compares together the opinions held respectively by Christians and by philosophers, and confirms all the dogmas of our religion by quotations from Plato and Aristotle, from Numenius[fn-30-P3005_794586:2166-nf] and Cornutus.[fn-30-P3006_794698:2167-nf] Miltiades[fn-30-P3007_794866:2168-nf] also wrote an excellent treatise against the Gentiles. Moreover Hippolytus[fn-30-P3008_795003:2169-nf] and a Roman senator named Apollonius[fn-30-P3009_795150:2170-nf] have each compiled apologetic works. The books of Julius Africanus[fn-30-P3010_795323:2171-nf] who wrote a history of his own times are still extant, as also are those of Theodore who was afterwards called Gregory,[fn-30-P3011_795592:2172-nf] a man endowed with apostolic miracles as well as with apostolic virtues.

So overpowered am I by the sad intelligence of the falling asleep of the holy and by me deeply revered Lucinius that I am scarcely able to dictate even a short letter. I do not, it is true, lament his fate, for I know that he has passed to better things: like Moses he can say: \"I will now turn aside and see this great sight.\"[fn-31-P3134_819754:2268-nf] but I am tormented with regret that I was not allowed to look upon the face of one, who was likely, as I believed, in a short time to come hither. True indeed is the prophetic warning concerning the doom of death that it divides brothers,[fn-31-P3135_820016:2269-nf] and with harsh and cruel hand sunders those whose names are linked together in the bonds of love. But we have this consolation that it is slain by the word of the Lord. For it is said: \"O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction,\" and in the next verse: \"An east wind shall come, the wind of the Lord shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up.\"[fn-31-P3136_820533:2270-nf] For, as Isaiah says, \"there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots\":[fn-31-P3137_820692:2271-nf] and He says Himself in the Song of Songs, \"I am the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valley.\"[fn-31-P3138_820815:2272-nf] Our rose is the destruction of death, and died that death itself might die in His dying. But, when it is said that He is to be brought \"from the wilderness,\" the virgin's womb is indicated, which without sexual intercourse or impregnation has given to us God in the form of an infant able to quench by the glow of the Holy Spirit the fountains of lust and to sing in the words of the psalm: \"as in a dry and pathless and waterless land, so have I appeared unto thee in the sanctuary.\"[fn-31-P3139_821322:2273-nf] Thus when we have to face the hard and cruel necessity of death, we are upheld by this consolation, that we shall shortly see again those whose absence we now mourn. For their end is not called death but a slumber and a falling asleep. Wherefore also the blessed apostle forbids us to sorrow concerning them which are asleep,[fn-31-P3140_821680:2274-nf] telling us to believe that those whom we know to sleep now may hereafter be roused from their sleep, and when their slumber is ended may watch once more with the saints and sing with the angels:-\"Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace among men of good will.\"[fn-31-P3141_821974:2275-nf] In heaven where there is no sin, there is glory and perpetual praise and unwearied singing; but on earth where sedition reigns, and war and discord hold sway, peace must be gained by prayer, and it is to be found not among all but only among men of good will, who pay heed to the apostolic salutation: \"Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.\"[fn-31-P3142_822376:2276-nf] For \"His abode is in peace and His dwelling place is in Zion,\"[fn-31-P3143_822459:2277-nf] that is, on a watch-tower,[fn-31-P3144_822552:2278-nf] on a height of doctrines and of virtues, in the soul of the believer; for the angel of this latter daily beholds the face of God,[fn-31-P3145_822750:2279-nf] and contemplates with unveiled face the glory of God.","index":"867","references":[{"fn":"31","code":"P3134_819754","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Exod. iii. 3.","bible_refs":[{"book":"exodus","chapter":3,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"31","code":"P3135_820016","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Hos. xiii. 15, Vulg.

Irenaeus goes on to say that subsequently Mark crossed the Pyrenees and occupied Spain, making it his object to seek out the houses of the wealthy, and in these especially the women, concerning whom we are told that they are \"led away with divers lusts, ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.\"[fn-31-P3157_827273:2289-nf] All this he wrote about three hundred years ago[fn-31-P3158_827360:2290-nf] in the extremely learned and eloquent books which he composed under the title Against all heresies.","index":"869","references":[{"fn":"31","code":"P3154_825409","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Probably as revived by Priscillian, who was put to death 385.

To-day you give me as my theme Fabiola, the praise of the Christians, the marvel of the gentiles, the sorrow of the poor, and the consolation of the monks. Whatever point in her character I choose to treat of first, pales into insignificance compared with those which follow after. Shall I praise her fasts? Her alms are greater still. Shall I commend her lowliness? The glow of her faith is yet brighter. Shall I mention her studied plainness in dress, her voluntary choice of plebeian costume and the garb of a slave that she might put to shame silken robes? To change one's disposition is a greater achievement than to change one's dress. It is harder for us to part with arrogance than with gold and gems. For, even though we throw away these, we plume ourselves sometimes on a meanness that is really ostentatious, and we make a bid with a saleable poverty for the popular applause. But a virtue that seeks concealment and is cherished in the inner consciousness appeals to no judgement but that of God. Thus the eulogies which I have to bestow upon Fabiola will be altogether new: I must neglect the order of the rhetoricians and begin all I have to say only from the cradle of her conversion and of her penitence. Another writer, mindful of the school, would perhaps bring forward Quintus Maximus, \"the man who by delaying rescued Rome,\"[fn-32-P3208_838364:2324-nf] and the whole Fabian family; he would describe their struggles and battles and would exult that Fabiola had come to us through a line so noble, shewing that qualities not apparent in the branch still existed in the root.

And because at the very outset there is a rock in the path and she is overwhelmed by a storm of censure, for having forsaken her first husband and having taken a second, I will not praise her for her conversion till I have first cleared her of this charge. So terrible then were the faults imputed to her former husband that not even a prostitute or a common slave could have put up with them. If I were to recount them, I should undo the heroism of the wife who chose to bear the blame of a separation rather than to blacken the character and expose the stains of him who was one body with her. I will only urge this one plea which is sufficient to exonerate a chaste matron and a Christian woman. The Lord has given commandment that a wife must not be put away \"except it be for fornication, and that, if put away, she must remain unmarried.\"[fn-32-P3210_839707:2325-nf] Now a commandment which is given to men logically applies to women also. For it cannot be that, while an adulterous wife is to be put away, an incontinent husband is to be retained. The apostle says: \"he which is joined to an harlot is one body.\"[fn-32-P3211_839993:2326-nf] Therefore she also who is joined to a whoremonger and unchaste person is made one body with him. The laws of Caesar are different, it is true, from the laws of Christ: Papinianus[fn-32-P3212_840196:2327-nf] commands one thing; our own Paul another. Earthly laws give a free rein to the unchastity of men, merely condemning seduction and adultery; lust is allowed to range unrestrained among brothels and slave girls, as if the guilt were constituted by the rank of the person assailed and not by the purpose of the assailant. But with us Christians what is unlawful for women is equally unlawful for men, and as both serve the same God both are bound by the same obligations. Fabiola then has put away-they are quite right-a husband that was a sinner, guilty of this and that crime, sins-I have almost mentioned their names-with which the whole neighbourhood resounded but which the wife alone refused to disclose. If however it is made a charge against her that after repudiating her husband she did not continue unmarried, I readily admit this to have been a fault, but at the same time declare that it may have been a case of necessity. \"It is better,\" the apostle tells us, \"to marry than to burn.\"[fn-32-P3213_841351:2328-nf] She was quite a young woman, she was not able to continue in widowhood. In the words of the apostle she saw another law in her members warring against the law of her mind;[fn-32-P3214_841548:2329-nf] she felt herself dragged in chains as a captive towards the indulgences of wedlock. Therefore she thought it better openly to confess her weakness and to accept the semblance of an unhappy marriage than, with the flame of a monogamist, to ply the trade of a courtesan. The same apostle wills that the younger widows should marry, bear children, and give no occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.[fn-32-P3215_841978:2330-nf] And he at once goes on to explain his wish: \"for some are already turned aside after Satan.\"[fn-32-P3216_842094:2331-nf] Fabiola therefore was fully persuaded in her own mind: she thought she had acted legitimately in putting away her husband, and that when she had done so she was free to marry again. She did not know that the rigour of the gospel takes away from women all pretexts for re-marriage so long as their former husbands are alive; and not knowing this, though she contrived to evade other assaults of the devil, she at this point unwittingly exposed herself to a wound from him.","index":"884","references":[{"fn":"32","code":"P3210_839707","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Matt. xix. 9. 1 Cor. vii. 11.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":19,"verses":[9]},{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":7,"verses":[11]}]},{"fn":"32","code":"P3211_839993","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1 Cor. vi. 16.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":6,"verses":[16]}]},{"fn":"32","code":"P3212_840196","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"A Roman jurist of great renown who held high legal office first under Marcus Aurelius and afterwards under Severus.

But why do I linger over old and forgotten matters, seeking to excuse a fault for which Fabiola has herself confessed her penitence? Who would believe that, after the death of her second husband at a time when most widows, having shaken off the yoke of servitude, grow careless and allow themselves more liberty than ever, frequenting the baths, flitting through the streets, shewing their harlot faces everywhere; that at this time Fabiola came to herself? Yet it was then that she put on sackcloth to make public confession of her error. It was then that in the presence of all Rome (in the basilica which formerly belonged to that Lateranus who perished by the sword of Caesar[fn-32-P3218_843271:2332-nf] ) she stood in the ranks of the penitents and exposed before bishop, presbyters, and people-all of whom wept when they saw her weep-her dishevelled hair, pale features, soiled hands and unwashed neck. What sins would such a penance fail to purge away? What ingrained stains would such tears be unable to wash out? By a threefold confession Peter blotted out his threefold denial.[fn-32-P3219_843887:2333-nf] If Aaron committed sacrilege by fashioning molten gold into the head of a calf, his brother's prayers made amends for his transgressions.[fn-32-P3220_844070:2334-nf] If holy David, meekest of men, committed the double sin of murder and adultery, he atoned for it by a fast of seven days. He lay upon the earth, he rolled in the ashes, he forgot his royal power, he sought for light in the darkness.[fn-32-P3221_844330:2335-nf] And then, turning his eyes to that God whom he had so deeply offended, he cried with a lamentable voice: \"Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight,\" and \"Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit.\"[fn-32-P3222_844618:2336-nf] He who by his virtues teaches me how to stand and not to fall, by his penitence teaches me how, if I fall, I may rise again.

Yet when Ahab heard these words \"he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted ...in sackcloth, and went softly.\"[fn-32-P3225_845376:2339-nf] Then came the word of God to Elijah the Tishbite saying: \"Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? Because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days.\"[fn-32-P3226_845584:2340-nf] O happy penitence which has drawn down upon itself the eyes of God, and which has by confessing its error changed the sentence of God's anger! The same conduct is in the Chronicles[fn-32-P3227_845802:2341-nf] attributed to Manasseh, and in the book of the prophet Jonah[fn-32-P3228_845910:2342-nf] to Nineveh, and in the gospel to the publican.[fn-32-P3229_845982:2343-nf] The first of these not only was allowed to obtain forgiveness but also recovered his kingdom, the second broke the force of God's impending wrath, while the third, smiting his breast with his hands, \"would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven.\" Yet for all that the publican with his humble confession of his faults went back justified far more than the Pharisee with his arrogant boasting of his virtues. This is not however the place to preach penitence, neither am I writing against Montanus and Novatus.[fn-32-P3230_846520:2344-nf] Else would I say of it that it is \"a sacrifice ...well pleasing to God,\"[fn-32-P3231_846690:2345-nf] I would cite the words of the psalmist: \"the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit,\"[fn-32-P3232_846796:2346-nf] and those of Ezekiel \"I prefer the repentance of a sinner rather than his death,\"[fn-32-P3233_846899:2347-nf] and those of Baruch, \"Arise, arise, O Jerusalem,\"[fn-32-P3234_846979:2348-nf] and many other proclamations madeby the trumpets of the prophets.

Or of diseased flesh alive with worms? Often did she carry on her own shoulders persons infected with jaundice or with filth. Often too did she wash away the matter discharged from wounds which others, even though men, could not bear to look at. She gave food to her patients with her own hand, and moistened the scarce breathing lips of the dying with sips of liquid. I know of many wealthy and devout persons who, unable to overcome their natural repugnance to such sights, perform this work of mercy by the agency of others, giving money instead of personal aid. I do not blame them and am far from construing their weakness of resolution into a want of faith. While however I pardon such squeamishness, I extol to the skies the enthusiastic zeal of a mind that is above it. A great faith makes little of such trifles. But I know how terrible was the retribution which fell upon the proud mind of the rich man clothed in purple for not having helped Lazarus.[fn-32-P3244_850397:2356-nf] The poor wretch whom we despise, whom we cannot so much as look at, and the very sight of whom turns our stomachs, is human like ourselves, is made of the same clay as we are, is formed out of the same elements.

Suddenly she made up her mind, against the advice of all her friends, to take ship and to come to Jerusalem. Here she was welcomed by a large concourse of people and for a short time took advantage of my hospitality. Indeed, when I call to mind our meeting, I seem to see her here now instead of in the past. Blessed Jesus, what zeal, what earnestness she bestowed upon the sacred volumes! In her eagerness to satisfy what was a veritable craving she would run through Prophets, Gospels, and Psalms: she would suggest questions and treasure up the answers in the desk of her own bosom. And yet this eagerness to hear did not bring with it any feeling of satiety: increasing her knowledge she also increased her sorrow,[fn-32-P3250_852470:2358-nf] and by casting oil upon the flame she did but supply fuel for a still more burning zeal. One day we had before us the book of Numbers written by Moses, and she modestly questioned me as to the meaning of the great mass of names there to be found. Why was it, she inquired, that single tribes were differently associated in this passage and in that, how came it that the soothsayer Balaam in prophesying of the future mysteries of Christ[fn-32-P3251_852929:2359-nf] spoke more plainly of Him than almost any other prophet? I replied as best I could and tried to satisfy her enquiries. Then unrolling the book still farther she came to the passage[fn-32-P3252_853136:2360-nf] in which is given the list of all the halting-places by which the people after leaving Egypt made its way to the waters of Jordan. And when she asked me the meaning and reason of each of these, I spoke doubtfully about some, dealt with others in a tone of assurance, and in several instances simply confessed my ignorance. Hereupon she began to press me harder still, expostulating with me as though it were a thing unallowable that I should be ignorant of what I did not know, yet at the same time affirming her own unworthiness to understand mysteries so deep. In a word I was ashamed to refuse her request and allowed her to extort from me a promise that I would devote a special work to this subject for her use. Till the present time I have had to defer the fulfilment of my promise: as I now perceive, by the Will of God in order that it should be consecrated to her memory. As in a previous work[fn-32-P3253_854060:2361-nf] I clothed her with the priestly vestments, so in the pages of the present[fn-32-P3254_854156:2362-nf] she may rejoice that she has passed through the wilderness of this world and has come at last to the land of promise.","index":"891","references":[{"fn":"32","code":"P3250_852470","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Eccl. i. 18.","bible_refs":[{"book":"ecclesiastes","chapter":1,"verses":[18]}]},{"fn":"32","code":"P3251_852929","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Nu. xxiv. 15-19.","bible_refs":[{"book":"numbers","chapter":24,"verses":[15]}]},{"fn":"32","code":"P3252_853136","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Nu. xxxiii.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"32","code":"P3253_854060","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Letter LXIV.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"32","code":"P3254_854156","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Letter LXXVIII. on the Mansions or Halting-places of Israel in the Desert.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"8. But let me continue the task which I have begun. Whilst I was in search of a suitable dwelling for so great a lady, whose only conception of the solitary life included a place of resort like Mary's inn; suddenly messengers flew this way and that and the whole East was terror-struck. For news came that the hordes of the Huns had poured forth all the way from Maeotis[fn-32-P3256_854728:2363-nf] (they had their haunts between the icy Tanais[fn-32-P3257_854800:2364-nf] and the rude Massagetae[fn-32-P3258_854842:2365-nf] where the gates of Alexander keep back the wild peoples behind the Caucasus); and that, speeding hither and thither on their nimble-footed horses, they were filling all the world with panic and bloodshed. The Roman army was absent at the time, being detained in Italy on account of the civil wars. Of these Huns Herodotus[fn-32-P3259_855222:2366-nf] tells us that under Darius King of the Medes they held the East in bondage for twenty years and that from the Egyptians and Ethiopians they exacted a yearly tribute. May Jesus avert from the Roman world the farther assaults of these wild beasts! Everywhere their approach was unexpected, they outstripped rumour in speed, and, when they came, they spared neither religion nor rank nor age, even for wailing infants they had no pity. Children were forced to die before it could be said that they had begun to live; and little ones not realizing their miserable fate might be seen smiling in the hands and at the weapons of their enemies. It was generally agreed that the goal of the invaders was Jerusalem and that it was their excessive desire for gold which made them hasten to this particular city. Its walls uncared for in time of peace were accordingly put in repair. Antioch was in a state of siege. Tyre, desirous of cutting itself off from the land, sought once more its ancient island. We too were compelled to marl our ships and to lie off the shore as a precaution against the arrival of our foes. No matter how hard the winds might blow, we could not but dread the barbarians more than shipwreck. It was not, however, so much for our own safety that we were anxious as for the chastity of the virgins who were with us. Just at that time also there was dissension among us,[fn-32-P3260_856648:2367-nf] and our intestine struggles threw into the shade our battle with the barbarians. I myself clung to my long-settled abode in the East and gave way to my deep-seated love for the holy places. Fabiola, used as she was to moving from city to city and having no other property but what her baggage contained, returned to her native land; to live in poverty where she had once been rich, to lodge in the house of another, she who in old days had lodged many guests in her own, and-not unduly to prolong my account-to bestow upon the poor before the eyes of Rome the proceeds of that property which Rome knew her to have sold.","index":"892","references":[{"fn":"32","code":"P3256_854728","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"The Sea of Azov.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"32","code":"P3257_854800","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"The Don.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"32","code":"P3258_854842","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"An Asiatic tribe to the East of the Caspian Sea.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"32","code":"P3259_855222","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Hdt. i. 106, (of the Scythians).","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"32","code":"P3260_856648","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"The Origenistic controversy in which Jerome, Paula and Epiphanius took one side, John bishop of Jerusalem, Rufinus, and Melania the other.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"9.

Theodosius, indeed, procured him from Africa a wife of the highest rank,[fn-33-P3306_867761:2395-nf] who, as her native land at this time was distracted by civil wars, became a kind of hostage for its loyalty. I ought to say at the very outset that Nebridius seems to have had a presentiment that he would die early. For amid the splendour of the palace and in the high positions to which his rank and not his years entitled him he lived always as one who believed that he must soon go to meet Christ. Of Cornelius, the centurion of the Italian band, the sacred narrative tells us that God so fully accepted him as to send to him an angel; and that this angel told him that to his merit was due the mystery whereby Peter from the narrow limits of the circumcision was conveyed to the wide field of the uncircumcision. He was the first Gentile baptized by the apostle, and in him the Gentiles were set apart to salvation. Now of this man it is written: \"there was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band, a devout man and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.\"[fn-33-P3307_868929:2396-nf] All this that is said of him I claim-with a change of name only-for my dear Nebridius. So \"devout\" was this latter and so enamoured of chastity that at his marriage he was still pure. So truly did he \"fear God with all his house\" that forgetting his high position he spent all his time with monks and clergymen. So profuse were the alms which he gave to the people that his doors were continually beset with swarms of sick and poor.

He used to avow that his own health and safety were dependent upon theirs. Their attendants and all those officers of the palace who by their numbers add to the grandeur of the imperial court he had so well conciliated by shewing his regard for them, that men who were in reality inferior to him were led by his attention to believe themselves his peers.

Especially is this so when she is of an age to fall into temptation and the authority of a husband is wanting to her. For the very shadow of a husband is a wife's safeguard. What has a widow to do with a large household or with troops of retainers? As servants, it is true, she must not despise them, but as men she ought to blush before them. If a grand establishment requires such domestics, let her at least set over them an old man of spotless morals whose dignity may guard the honour of his mistress. I know of many widows who, although they live with closed doors, have not escaped the imputation of too great intimacy with their servants. These latter become objects of suspicion when they dress above their degree, or when they are stout and sleek, or when they are of an age inclined to passion, or when knowledge of the favour in which they are secretly held betrays itself in a too confident demeanour. For such pride, however carefully concealed, is sure to break out in a contempt for fellow-servants as servants.

For they treat of subjects on which the philosophers have spent all their days and yet have been able to discover nothing. In dealing with these themes Origen has done his best to make belief in a Creator and a rational account of things created subservient to religion and not, as with the philosophers, to irreligion. Wherever then in his books I have found a statement concerning the Trinity contrary to those which in other places he has faithfully made on the same subject, I have either omitted the passage as garbled and misleading or have substituted that view of the matter which I find him to have frequently asserted. Again, wherever-in haste to get on with his theme-he is brief or obscure relying on the skill and intelligence of his readers, I, to make the passage clearer, have sought to explain it by adding any plainer statements that I have read on the point in his other books. But I have added nothing of my own. The words used may be found in other parts of his writings: they are his, not mine.

But if he cannot be at peace with my brother unless he consents to submit and to renounce the bishop who has ordained him, he shews plainly that his object is not peace but revenge, and that he will not rest satisfied with the quietude of repose and peace unless he is able to inflict to the full every penalty that he now threatens. Had he himself ordained my brother, it would have made no difference to this latter. So dearly does he love seclusion that he would even then have continued to live quietly and would not have exercised his office.

Let them shew themselves peacemakers, and peace will follow at once. Why do they use the name of your holiness to terrorize us, when your letter-strange contrast to their harsh and menacing words-breathes only peace and meekness? For that the letter which Isidore the presbyter has brought for me from you does make for peace and harmony I know by this, that these insincere professors of a wish for peace have refused to deliver it to me.

The church of Christ has been founded by shedding its own blood not that of others, by enduring outrage not by inflicting it. Persecutions have made it grow; martyrdoms have crowned it. Or if the Christians among whom I live are unique in their love of severity and know only how to persecute and not how to undergo persecution, there are Jews here, there are heretics professing various false doctrines, and in particular the foulest of all, I mean, Manichaeism. Why is it that they do not venture to say a word against them? Why am I the only person they wish to drive into exile? Am I who communicate with the church the only person of whom it can be said that he rends the church? I put it to you, is it not a fair demand either that they should expel these others as well as myself, or that, if they keep them, they should keep me too?

And lest even this should appear distant, in this village of Bethlehem I hold communion with his presbyters as much as I can. Thus it is clear that a private chagrin is not to be taken for the cause of the church, and that one man's choler, or even that of several stirred up by him, ought not to be styled the displeasure of the church. Accordingly I now repeat what I said at the beginning of my letter that I for my part am desirous of Christ's peace, that I pray for harmony, and that I request you to admonish him not to exact peace but to purpose it.

It is charged against me that I have sometimes praised Origen. If I am not mistaken I have only done so in two places, in the short preface (addressed to Damasus) to his homilies on the Song of Songs and in the prologue to my book of Hebrew Names. In these passages do the dogmas of the church come into question? Is anything said of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost? or of the resurrection of the flesh? or of the condition and material of the soul? I have merely praised the simplicity of his rendering and commentary and neither the faith nor the dogmas of the Church come in at all. Ethics only are dealt with and the mist of allegory is dispelled by a clear explanation. I have praised the commentator but not the theologian, the man of intellect but not the believer, the philosopher but not the apostle. But if men wish to know my real judgement upon Origen; let them read my commentaries upon Ecclesiastes, let them go through my three books upon the epistle to the Ephesians: they will then see that I have always opposed his doctrines. How foolish it would be to eulogize a system so far as to endorse its blasphemy!

At Antioch I frequently listened to Apollinaris of Laodicea, and attended his lectures; yet, although he instructed me in the holy scriptures, I never embraced his disputable doctrine as to their meaning. At length my head became sprinkled with gray hairs so that I looked more like a master than a disciple. Yet I went on to Alexandria and heard Didymus.[fn-35-P3529_937729:2556-nf] And I have much to thank him for: for what I did not know I learned from him, and what I knew already I did not forget. So excellent was his teaching. Men fancied that I had now made an end of learning. Yet once more I came to Jerusalem and to Bethlehem. What trouble and expense it cost me to get Baraninas[fn-35-P3530_938061:2557-nf] to teach me under cover of night. For by his fear of the Jews he presented to me in his own person a second edition of Nicodemus.[fn-35-P3531_938354:2558-nf] Of all of these I have frequently made mention in my works. The doctrines of Apollinaris and of Didymus are mutually contradictory. The squadrons of the two leaders must drag me in different directions, for I acknowledge both as my masters. If it is expedient to hate any men and to loath any race, I have a strange dislike to those of the circumcision. For up to the present day they persecute our Lord Jesus Christ in the synagogues of Satan.[fn-35-P3532_938821:2559-nf] Yet can anyone find fault with me for having had a Jew as a teacher? Does a certain person dare to bring forward against me the letter I wrote to Didymus calling him my master? It is a great crime, it would seem, for me a disciple to give to one both old and learned the name of master. And yet when I ask leave to look at the letter which has been held over so long to discredit me at last, there is nothing in it but courteous language and a few words of greeting. Such charges are both foolish and frivolous. It would be more to the point to exhibit a passage in which I have defended heresy or praised some wicked doctrine of Origen. In the portion of Isaiah which describes the crying of the two seraphim[fn-35-P3533_939556:2560-nf] he explains these to be the Son and the Holy Ghost; but have not I altered this hateful explanation into a reference to the two testaments?[fn-35-P3534_939717:2561-nf] I have the book in my hand as it was published twenty years ago. In numbers of my works and especially in my commentaries I have, as occasion has offered, mangled this heathen school. And if my opponents allege that I have done more than anyone else to form a collection of Origen's books, I answer that I only wish I could have the works of all theological writers that by diligent study of them, I might make up for the slowness of my own wits. I have made a collection of his books, I admit; but because I know everything that he has written I do not follow his errors. I speak as a Christian to Christians: believe one who has tried him. His doctrines are poisonous, they are unknown to the Holy Scriptures, nay more, they do them violence. I have read Origen, I repeat, I have read him; and if it is a crime to read him, I admit my guilt: indeed, these Alexandrian writings have emptied my purse. If you will believe me, I have never been an Origenist: if you will not believe me, I have now ceased to be one. But if even this fails to convince you, you will compel me in self-defence to write against your favourite, so that, if you will not believe me when I disclaim him, you will have to believe me when I attack him. But I find readier credence when I go wrong than when I shew amendment. And this is not surprising, for my would-be friends suppose me a fellow-disciple with them in the arcana of their system. I am loath, they fancy, to profess esoteric doctrines before persons who according to them are brute-like and made of clay. For it is an axiom with them that pearls ought not to be lightly cast before swine, nor that which is holy given to the dogs.[fn-35-P3535_941417:2562-nf] They agree with David when he says: \"Thy word have I hid in mine heart that I might not sin against thee;\"[fn-35-P3536_941547:2563-nf] and when in another place he describes the righteous man as one \"who speaketh truth with his neighbour,\"[fn-35-P3537_941675:2564-nf] that is with those who \"are of the household of faith.\"[fn-35-P3538_941774:2565-nf] From these passages they conclude that those of us who as yet are uninitiated ought to be told falsehoods, lest, being still unweaned babes, we should be choked by too solid food. Now that perjury and lying enter into their mysteries and form a bond between them appears most clearly from the sixth book of Origen's Miscellanies,[fn-35-P3539_942126:2566-nf] in which he harmonizes the Christian doctrine[fn-35-P3540_942241:2567-nf] with the conceptions of Plato.","index":"965","references":[{"fn":"35","code":"P3529_937729","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"See Letter L.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"35","code":"P3530_938061","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"From this Jew Jerome took lessons in Hebrew during the earlier years of his life at Bethlehem.

I will bring forward their sacred rites and mysteries, and will expose the cunning whereby they delude simple folk like myself. Perhaps, although they refuse credence to my voice when I deny, they may believe my pen when I accuse. Of one thing they are particularly apprehensive, and that is that their writings may some day be taken as evidence against their master. They are ready to make statements on oath and to disclaim them afterwards with an oath as false as the first. When asked for their signatures they use shifts and seek excuses. One says: \"I cannot condemn what no one else has condemned.\" Another says: \"No decision was arrived at on the point by the Fathers.\"[fn-35-P3542_943208:2568-nf] It is thus that they appeal to the judgment of the world to put off the necessity of assenting to a condemnation.

For the council which condemned Arius would surely have condemned Origen too, had it disapproved of his doctrines.\" They were bound in other words to cure all the diseases of the church at once and with one remedy; and by parity of reasoning we must deny the majesty of the Holy Ghost because nothing was said of his nature in that council. But the question was of Arius, not of Origen; of the Son, not of the Holy Ghost. The bishops at the council proclaimed their adherence to a dogma which was at the time denied; they said nothing about a difficulty which no one had raised. And yet they covertly struck at Origen as the source of the Arian heresy: for, in condemning those who deny the Son to be of the substance of the Father, they have condemned Origen as much as Arius.

Lo and behold, you yourselves correct in Origen's books passages which (according to you) he never wrote: and yet you are surprised if a man is said to have published a book which as a matter of fact he did not publish. But while your statements can easily be brought to the test by an appeal to Origen's published works; as Pamphilus has published nothing else, it is easier for calumny to fix a book upon him. For shew me any other work of Pamphilus; you will nowhere find any, this is his only one. How then can I know that it is by Pamphilus? You will tell me, that the style and tone ought to inform me. Well, I shall never believe that a man so learned has dedicated the first fruits of his talent to defend doubtful and discredited positions. The very name of an apology which the treatise bears implies a previous charge made; for nothing is defended that is not first attacked. I will now bring forward but a single argument, one, however, the force of which only folly and effrontery can deny. The treatise attributed to Pamphilus contains nearly the first thousand lines of Eusebius's sixth book in defence of Origen.[fn-35-P3590_963213:2606-nf] Yet in the remaining parts of his work the writer brings forward passages by which he seeks to prove that Origen was a Catholic. Now Eusebius and Pamphilus were in such thorough harmony with each other that they seemed to have but one soul between them, and one even went so far as to adopt the other's name.[fn-35-P3591_963670:2607-nf] How then could they have disagreed so fundamentally on this point, Eusebius in all his works proving Origen to be an Arian, and Pamphilus describing him as a supporter of the Nicene council, which had not yet been held? It is evident from this consideration that the book belongs not to Pamphilus but to Didymus or somebody else, who having cut off the head of Eusebius's sixth book supplied the other members himself. But I am willing to be generous and to allow that the book is written by Pamphilus, only by Pamphilus not yet a martyr. For he must have written the book before he underwent martyrdom. And why, you will say, was he accounted worthy of martyrdom? Surely that he might efface his error by a martyr's death, and wash away his one fault by shedding his blood. How many martyrs there have been all the world over who before their deaths have been the slaves of sins!

It must learn to hear nothing and to say nothing but what belongs to the fear of God. It must have no understanding of unclean words, and no knowledge of the world's songs. Its tongue must be steeped while still tender in the sweetness of the psalms. Boys with their wanton thoughts must be kept from Paula: even her maids and female attendants must be separated from worldly associates. For if they have learned some mischief they may teach more. Get for her a set of letters made of boxwood or of ivory and called each by its proper name. Let her play with these, so that even her play may teach her something. And not only make hergrasp the right order of the letters and see that she forms their names into a rhyme, but constantly disarrange their order and put the last letters in the middle and the middle ones at the beginning that she may know them all by sight as well as by sound. Moreover, so soon as she begins to use the style upon the wax, and her hand is still faltering, either guide her soft fingers by laying your hand upon hers, or else have simple copies cut upon a tablet; so that her efforts confined within these limits may keep to the lines traced out for her and not stray outside of these. Offer prizes for good spelling and draw her onwards with little gifts such as children of her age delight in. And let her have companions in her lessons to excite emulation in her, that she may be stimulated when she sees them praised. You must not scold her if she is slow to learn but must employ praise to excite her mind, so that she may be glad when she excels others and sorry when she is excelled by them, Above all you must take care not to make her lessons distasteful to her lest a dislike for them conceived in childhood may continue into her maturer years. The very words which she tries bit by bit to put together and to pronounce ought not to be chance ones, but names specially fixed upon and heaped together for the purpose, those for example of the prophets or the apostles or the list of patriarchs from Adam downwards as it is given by Matthew and Luke. In this way while her tongue will be well-trained, her memory will be likewise developed. Again, you must choose for her a master of approved years, life, and learning. A man of culture will not, I think, blush to do for a kinswoman or a highborn virgin what Aristotle did for Philip's son when, descending to the level of an usher, he consented to teach him his letters.[fn-37-P3778_1015845:2676-nf] Things must not be despised as of small account in the absence of which great results cannot be achieved. The very rudiments and first beginnings of knowledge sound differently in the mouth of an educated man and of an uneducated. Accordingly you must see that the child is not led away by the silly coaxing of women to form a habit of shortening long words or of decking herself with gold and purple. Of these habits one will spoil her conversation and the other her character. She must not therefore learn as a child what afterwards she will have to unlearn. The eloquence of the Gracchi is said to have been largely due to the way in which from their earliest years their mother spoke to them.[fn-37-P3779_1016575:2677-nf] Hortensius[fn-37-P3780_1016614:2678-nf] became an orator while still on his father's lap.

Paula's nurse must not be intemperate, or loose, or given to gossip. Her bearer must be respectable, and her foster-father of grave demeanour. When she sees her grandfather, she must leap upon his breast, put her arms round his neck, and, whether he likes it or not, sing Alleluia in his ears. She may be fondled by her grandmother, may smile at her father to shew that she recognizes him, and may so endear herself to everyone, as to make the whole family rejoice in the possession of such a rosebud. She should be told at once whom she has for her other grandmother and whom for her aunt; and she ought also to learn in what army it is that she is enrolled as a recruit, and what Captain it is under whose banner she is called to serve.

The layman in Lent consumes the coats of his stomach, and living like a snail on his own juices makes ready a paunch for rich foods and feasting to come.

For you cannot but tremble as you watch what she says and to whom she says it, to whom she bows and whom she likes best to see.

For one who despised the glory of a single city is to-day famous throughout the world; and one who while she lived at Rome was known by no one outside it has by hiding herself at Bethlehem become the admiration of all lands Roman and barbarian. For what race of men is there which does not send pilgrims to the holy places? And who could there find a greater marvel than Paula? As among many jewels the most precious shines. most brightly, and as the sun with its beams obscures and puts out the paler fires of the stars; so by her lowliness she surpassed all others in virtue and influence and, while she was least among all, was greater than all. The more she cast herself down, the more she was lifted up by Christ. She was hidden and yet she was not hidden.

It so happened that at that time[fn-38-P3873_1048483:2750-nf] the bishops of the East and West had been summoned to Rome by letter from the emperors[fn-38-P3874_1048589:2751-nf] to deal with certain dissensions between the churches, and in this way she saw two most admirable men and Christian prelates, Paulinus bishop of Antioch and Epiphanius, bishop of Salamis or, as it is now called, Constantia, in Cyprus. Epiphanius, indeed, she received as her guest; and, although Paulinus was staying in another person's house, in the warmth of her heart she treated him as if he too were lodged with her. Inflamed by their virtues she thought more and more each moment of forsaking her home. Disregarding her house, her children, her servants, her property, and in a word everything connected with the world, she was eager-alone and unaccompanied (if ever it could be said that she was so)-to go to the desert made famous by its Paula and by its Antonies. And at last when the winter was over and the sea was open, and when the bishops were returning to their churches, she also sailed with them in her prayers and desires. Not to prolong the story, she went down to Portus accompanied by her brother, her kinsfolk and above all her own children eager by their demonstrations of affection to overcome their loving mother. At last the sails were set and the strokes of the rowers carried the vessel into the deep. On the shore the little Toxotius stretched forth his hands in entreaty, while Rufina, now grown up, with silent sobs besought her mother to wait till she should be married. But still Paula's eyes were dry as she turned them heaven wards; and she overcame her love for her children by her love for God. She knew herself no more as a mother, that she might approve herself a handmaid of Christ. Yet her heart was rent within her, and she wrestled with her grief, as though she were being forcibly separated from parts of herself. The greatness of the affection she had to overcome made all admire her victory the more. Among the cruel hardships which attend prisoners of war in the hands of their enemies, there is none severer than the separation of parents from their children. Though it is against the laws of nature, she endured this trial with unabated faith; nay more she sought it with a joyful heart: and overcoming her love for her children by her greater love for God, she concentrated herself quietly upon Eustochium alone, the partner alike of her vows and of her voyage. Meantime the vessel ploughed onwards and all her fellow-passengers looked back to the shore. But she turned away her eyes that she might not see what she could not behold without agony.

Turning away thence Paula saw the tombs of the twelve patriarchs, and Samaria which in honour of Augustus Herod renamed Augusta or in Greek Sebaste. There lie the prophets Elisha and Obadiah and John the Baptist than whom there is not a greater among those that are born of women.[fn-39-P3999_1074004:2861-nf] And here she was filled with terror by the marvels she beheld; for she saw demons screaming under different tortures before the tombs of the saints, and men howling like wolves, baying like dogs, roaring like lions, hissing like serpents and bellowing like bulls. They twisted their heads and bent them backwards until they touched the ground; women too were suspended head downward and their clothes did not fall off.[fn-40-P4000_1074450:2862-nf] Paula pitied them all, and shedding tears over them prayed Christ to have mercy on them.

Or any man at whose feet she did not throw herself? In each of His saints she believed that she saw Christ Himself; and whatever she bestowed upon them she rejoiced to feel that she had bestowed it upon the Lord. Her enthusiasm was wonderful and her endurance scarcely credible in a woman. Forgetful of her sex and of her weakness she even desired to make her abode, together with the girls who accompanied her, among these thousands of monks. And, as they were all willing to welcome her, she might perhaps have sought and obtained permission to do so; had she not been drawn away by a still greater passion for the holy places. Coming by sea from Pelusium to Maioma on account of the great heat, she returned so rapidly that you would have thought her a bird. Not long afterwards, making up her mind to dwell permanently in holy Bethlehem, she took up her abode for three years? a miserable hostelry; till she could build the requisite cells and monastic buildings, to say nothing of a guest house for passing travellers where they might find the welcome which Mary and Joseph had missed. At this point I conclude my narrative of the journeys that she made accompanied by Eustochium and many other virgins.","index":"1107","references":[{"fn":"40","code":"P4008_1076074","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Jer. ii. 18.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4009_1076228","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Isa. xix. 18.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":19,"verses":[18]}]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4010_1076518","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Ps. lxxviii. 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":78,"verses":[12]}]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4011_1076647","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"A mistake: No is Thebes.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4012_1076735","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"i.e. presbyters and deacons.

I am now free to describe at greater length the virtue which was her peculiar charm; and in setting forth this I call God to witness that I am no flatterer. I add nothing. I exaggerate nothing. On the contrary I tone down much that I may not appear to relate incredibilities. My carping critics must not insinuate that I am drawing on my imagination or decking Paula, like sop's crow, with the fine feathers of other birds. Humility is the first of Christian graces, and hers was so pronounced that one who had never seen her, and who on account of her celebrity had desired to see her, would have believed that he saw not her but the lowest of her maids. When she was surrounded by companies of virgins she was always the least remarkable in dress, in speech, in gesture, and in gait. From the time that her husband died until she fell asleep herself she never sat at meat with a man, even though she might know him to stand upon the pinnacle of the episcopate. She never entered a bath except when dangerously ill. Even in the severest fever she rested not on an ordinary bed but on the hard ground covered only with a mat of goat's hair; if that can be called rest which made day and night alike a time of almost unbroken prayer. Well did she fulfil the words of the psalter: \"All the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tear\"![fn-40-P4017_1080317:2877-nf] Her tears welled forth as it were from fountains, and she lamented her slightest faults as if they were sins of the deepest dye. Constantly did I warn her to spare her eyes and to keep them for the reading of the gospel; but she only said: `I must disfigure that face which contrary to God's commandment I have painted with rouge, white lead, and antimony. I must mortify that body which has been given up to many pleasures. I must make up for my long laughter by constant weeping. I must exchange my soft linen and costly silks for rough goat's hair. I who have pleased my husband and the world in the past, desire now to please Christ.' Were I among her great and signal virtues to select her chastity as a subject of praise, my words would seem superfluous; for, even when she was still in the world, she set an example to all the matrons of Rome, and bore herself so admirably that themost slanderous never ventured to couple scandal with her name.[fn-40-P4018_1081313:2878-nf] No mind could be more considerate than hers, or none kinder towards the lowly. She did not court the powerful; at the same time, if the proud and the vainglorious sought her, she did not turn from them with disdain. If she saw a poor man, she supported him: and if she saw a rich one, she urged him to do good. Her liberality alone knew no bounds. Indeed, so anxious was she to turn no needy person away that she borrowed money at interest and often contracted new loans to pay off old ones. I was wrong, I admit; but when I saw her so profuse in giving, I reproved her alleging the apostle's words: \"I mean not that other men be eased and ye burthened; but by an equality that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want.\"[fn-40-P4019_1082288:2879-nf] I quoted from the gospel the Saviour's words: \"he that hath two coats, let him impart one of them to him that hath none\";[fn-40-P4020_1082431:2880-nf] and I warned her that she might not always have means to do as she would wish. Other arguments I adduced to the same purpose; but with admirable modesty and brevity she overruled them all. \"God is my witness,\" she said, \"that what I do I do for His sake. My prayer is that I may die a beggar not leaving a penny to my daughter and indebted to strangers for my winding sheet.\" She then concluded with these words: \"I, if I beg, shall find many to give to me; but if this beggar does not obtain help from me who by borrowing can give it to him, he will die; and if he dies, of whom will his soul be required?\" I wished her to be more careful in managing her concerns, but she with a faith more glowing than mine clave to the Saviour with her whole heart and poor in spirit followed the Lord in His poverty, giving back to Him what she had received and becoming poor for His sake. She obtained her wish at last and died leaving her daughter overwhelmed with a mass of debt. This Eustochium still owes and indeed cannot hope to pay off by her own exertions; only the mercy of Christ can free her from it.","index":"1108","references":[{"fn":"40","code":"P4017_1080317","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"2 Cor. viii. 13, 2 Cor. viii. 14.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":8,"verses":[13]}]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4018_1081313","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Luke iii. 11.

Envy always follows in the track of virtue: as Horace says, it is ever the mountain top that is smitten by the lightning.[fn-40-P4034_1086476:2891-nf] It is not surprising that I declare this of men and women, when the jealousy of the Pharisees succeeded in crucifying our Lord Himself. All the saints have had illwishers, and even Paradise was not free from the serpent through whose malice death came into the world.[fn-40-P4035_1086835:2892-nf] So the Lord stirred up against Paula Hadad the Edomite[fn-40-P4036_1086914:2893-nf] to buffet her that she might not be exalted, and warned her frequently by the thorn in her flesh[fn-40-P4037_1087057:2894-nf] not to be elated by the greatness of her own virtues or to fancy that, compared with other women, she had attained the summit of perfection. For my part I used to say that it was best to give in to rancour and to retire before passion. So Jacob dealt with his brother Esau; so David met the unrelenting persecution of Saul. I reminded her how the first of these fled into Mesopotamia;[fn-40-P4038_1087467:2895-nf] and how the second surrendered himself to the Philistines,[fn-40-P4039_1087548:2896-nf] and chose to submit to foreign foes rather than to enemies at home. She however replied as follows:- 'Your suggestion would be a wise one if the devil did not everywhere fight against God's servants and handmaidens, and did he not always precede the fugitives to their chosen refuges. Moreover, I am deterred from accepting it by my love for the holy places; and I cannot find another Bethlehem elsewhere. Why may I not by my patience conquer this ill will?

I shall now describe the order of her monastery and the method by which she turned the continence of saintly souls to her own profit. She sowed carnal things that she might reap spiritual things;[fn-40-P4091_1097643:2946-nf] she gave earthly things that she might receive heavenly things; she forewent things temporal that she might in their stead obtain things eternal. Besides establishing a monastery for men, the charge of which she left to men, she divided into three companies and monasteries the numerous virgins whom she had gathered out of different provinces, some of whom are of noble birth while others belonged to the middle or lower classes. But, although they worked and had their meals separately from each other, these three companies met together for psalm-singing and prayer. After the chanting of the Alleluia-the signal by which they were summoned to the Collect[fn-40-P4092_1098462:2947-nf] -no one was permitted to remain behind. But either first or among the first Paula used to await the arrival of the rest, urging them to diligence rather by her own modest example than by motives of fear. At dawn, at the third, sixth, and ninth hours, at evening, and at midnight they recited the psalter each in turn.[fn-40-P4093_1098839:2948-nf] No sister was allowed to be ignorant of the psalms, and all had every day to learn a certain portion of the holy scriptures. On the Lord's day only they proceeded to the church beside which they lived, each company following its own mother-superior. Returning home in the same order, they then devoted themselves to their allotted tasks, and made garments either for themselves or else for others. If a virgin was of noble birth, she was not allowed to have an attendant belonging to her own household lest her maid having her mind full of the doings of old days and of the license of childhood might by constant converse open old wounds and renew former errors. All the sisters were clothed alike. Linen was not used except for drying the hands. So strictly did Paula separate them from men that she would not allow even eunuchs to approach them; lest she should give occasion to slanderous tongues (always ready to cavil at the religious) to console themselves for their own misdoing. When a sister was backward in coming to the recitation of the psalms or shewed herself remiss in her work, Paula used to approach her in different ways. Was she quick-tempered? Paula coaxed her. Was she phlegmatic? Paula chid her, copying the example of the apostle who said: \"What will ye? Shall I come to you with a rod or in love and in the spirit of meekness?\"[fn-40-P4094_1100215:2949-nf] Apart from food and raiment she allowed no one to have anything she could call her own, for Paul had said, \"Having food and raiment let us be therewith content.\"[fn-40-P4095_1100400:2950-nf] She was afraid lest the custom of having more should breed covetousness in them; an appetite which no wealth can satisfy, for the more it has the more it requires, and neither opulence nor indigence is able to diminish it.[fn-40-P4096_1100652:2951-nf] When the sisters quarrelled one with another she reconciled them with soothing words. If the younger ones were troubled with fleshly desires, she broke their force by imposing redoubled fasts; for she wished her virgins to be ill in body rather than to suffer in soul. If she chanced to notice any sister too attentive to her dress, she reproved her for her error with knitted brows and severe looks, saying; \"a clean body and a clean dress mean an unclean soul. A virgin's lips should never utter an improper or an impure word, for such indicate a lascivious mind and by the outward man the faults of the inward are made manifest.\" When she saw a sister verbose and talkative or forward and taking pleasure in quarrels, and when she found after frequent admonitions that the offender shewed no signs of improvement; she placed her among the lowest of the sisters and outside their society, ordering her to pray at the door of the refectory instead of with the rest, and commanding her to take her food by herself, in the hope that where rebuke had failed shame might bring about a reformation. The sin of theft she loathed as if it were sacrilege; and that which among men of the world is counted little or nothing she declared to be in a monastery a crime of the deepest dye. How shall I describe her kindness and attention towards the sick or the wonderful care and devotion with which she nursed them? Yet, although when others were sick she freely gave them every indulgence, and even allowed them to eat meat; when she fell ill herself, she made no concessions to her own weakness, and seemed unfairly to change in her own case to harshness the kindness which she was always ready to shew to others.","index":"1113","references":[{"fn":"40","code":"P4091_1097643","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"The Gathering; perhaps used, like the Greek sunodoj, for the Communion.

No young girl of sound and vigorous constitution could have delivered herself up to a regimen so rigid as that imposed upon herself by Paula whose physical powers age had impaired and enfeebled. I admit that in this she was too determined, refusing to spare herself or to listen to advice. I will relate what I know to be a fact. In the extreme heat of the month of July she was once attacked by a violent fever and we despaired of her life. However by God's mercy she rallied, and the doctors urged upon her the necessity of taking a little light wine to accelerate her recovery; saying that if she continued to drink water they feared that she might become dropsical. I on my side secretly appealed to the blessed pope Epiphanius to admonish, nay even to compel her, to take the wine. But she with her usual sagacity and quickness at once perceived the stratagem, and with a smile let him see that the advice he was giving her was after all not his but mine. Not to waste more words, the blessed prelate after many exhortations left her chamber; and, when I asked him what he had accomplished, replied, \"Only this that old as I am I have been almost persuaded to drink no more wine.\" I relate this story not because I approve of persons rashly taking upon themselves burthens beyond their strength (for does not the scripture say: \"Burden not thyself above thy power\"?[fn-40-P4098_1103758:2952-nf] ) but because I wish from this quality of perseverance in her to shew the passion of her mind and the yearning of her believing soul; both of which made her sing in David's words, \"My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth after thee.\"[fn-40-P4099_1104020:2953-nf] Difficult as it is always to avoid extremes, the philosophers[fn-41-P4100_1104119:2954-nf] are quite right in their opinion that virtue is a mean and vice an excess, or as we may express it in one short sentence \"In nothing too much.\"[fn-41-P4101_1104308:2955-nf] While thus unyielding in her contempt for food Paula was easily moved to sorrow and felt crushed by the deaths of her kinsfolk, especially those of her children. When one after another her husband and her daughters fell asleep, on each occasion the shock of their loss endangered her life. And although she signed her mouth and her breast with the sign of the cross, and endeavoured thus to alleviate a mother's grief; her feelings overpowered her and her maternal instincts were too much for her confiding mind. Thus while her intellect retained its mastery she was overcome by sheer physical weakness. On one occasion a sickness seized her and clung to her so long that it brought anxiety to us and danger to herself. Yet even then she was full of joy and repeated every moment the apostle's words: \"O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?\"[fn-41-P4102_1105210:2956-nf] ","index":"1114","references":[{"fn":"40","code":"P4098_1103758","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Ps. lxiii. 1.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":63,"verses":[1]}]},{"fn":"40","code":"P4099_1104020","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"e.g. Aristotle, E.N. ii. 6.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"41","code":"P4100_1104119","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Ne quid nimis, in Greek Mhden agan.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"41","code":"P4101_1104308","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Rom. vii. 24.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":7,"verses":[24]}]},{"fn":"41","code":"P4102_1105210","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"2 Tim. iv. 7, 2 Tim. iv. 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 timothy","chapter":4,"verses":[7]}]}]},{"text":"The careful reader may say that my words are an invective rather than an eulogy.

I must briefly mention the manner in which she avoided the foul cisterns of the heretics whom she regarded as no better than heathen. A certain cunning knave, in his own estimation both learned and clever, began without my knowledge to put to her such questions as these: What sin has an infant committed that it should be seized by the devil? Shall we be young or old when we rise again? If we die young and rise young, we shall after the resurrection require to have nurses. If however we die young and rise old, the dead will not rise again at all: they will be transformed into new beings. Will there be a distinction of sexes in the next world? Or will there be no such distinction? If the distinction continues, there will be wedlock and sexual intercourse and procreation of children. If however it does not continue, the bodies that rise again will not be the same. For, he argued, \"the earthy tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things,\"[fn-41-P4120_1108799:2971-nf] but the bodies that we shall have in heaven will be subtle and spiritual according to the words of the apostle: \"it is sown a natural body: it is raised a spiritual body.\"[fn-41-P4121_1108995:2972-nf] From all of which considerations he sought to prove that rational creatures have been for their faults and previous sins subjected to bodily conditions; and that according to the nature and guilt of their transgression they are born in this or that state of life. Some, he said, rejoice in sound bodies and wealthy and noble parents; others have for their portion diseased frames and poverty stricken homes; and by imprisonment in the present world and in bodies pay the penalty of their former sins. Paula listened and reported what she heard to me, at the same time pointing out the man. Thus upon me was laid the task of opposing this most noxious viper and deadly pest. It is of such that the Psalmist speaks when he writes: \"deliver not the soul of thy turtle dove unto the wild beast,\"[fn-41-P4122_1109816:2973-nf] and \"Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds;\"[fn-41-P4123_1109888:2974-nf] creatures who write iniquity and speak lies against the Lord and lift up their mouths against the Most High. As the fellow had tried to deceive Paula, I at her request went to him, and by asking him a few questions involved him in a dilemma. Do you believe, said I, that there will be a resurrection of the dead or do you disbelieve? He replied, I believe. I went on: Will the bodies that rise again be the same or different? He said, The same. Then I asked: What of their sex? Will that remain unaltered or will it be changed? At this question he became silent and swayed his head this way and that as a serpent does to avoid being struck. Accordingly I continued, As you have nothing to say I will answer for you and will draw the conclusion from your premises. If the woman shall not rise again as a woman nor the man as a man, there will be no resurrection of the dead. For the body is made up of sex and members. But if there shall be no sex and no members what will become of the resurrection of the body, which cannot exist without sex and members? And if there shall be no resurrection of the body, there can be no resurrection of the dead. But as to your objection taken from marriage, that, if the members shall remain the same, marriage must inevitably be allowed; it is disposed of by the Saviour's words: \"ye do err not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God. For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels.\"[fn-41-P4124_1111400:2975-nf] When it is said that they neither marry nor are given in marriage, the distinction of sex is shewn to persist. For no one says of things which have no capacity for marriage such as a stick or a stone that they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but this may well be said of those who while they can marry yet abstain from doing so by their own virtue and by the grace of Christ. But if you cavil at this and say, how shall we in that case be like the angels with whom there is neither male nor female, hear my answer in brief as follows. What the Lord promises to us is not the nature of angels but their mode of life and their bliss. And therefore John the Baptist is called an angel[fn-41-P4125_1112165:2976-nf] even before he is beheaded, and all God's holy men and virgins manifest in themselves even in this world the life of angels. When it is said \"ye shall be like the angels,\" likeness only is promised and not a change of nature.","index":"1117","references":[{"fn":"41","code":"P4120_1108799","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1 Cor. xv. 44.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":15,"verses":[44]}]},{"fn":"41","code":"P4121_1108995","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Ps. lxxiv. 19, R.V.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":74,"verses":[19]}]},{"fn":"41","code":"P4122_1109816","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Ps. lxviii. 30, R.V.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":68,"verses":[30]}]},{"fn":"41","code":"P4123_1109888","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Matt. xxii. 29, Matt. xxii. 30.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":22,"verses":[29]},{"book":"matthew","chapter":22,"verses":[30]}]},{"fn":"41","code":"P4124_1111400","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Luke vii. 27. `Angel\f0' is a Greek word and means `messenger.\f0'","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":7,"verses":[27]}]},{"fn":"41","code":"P4125_1112165","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Joh. xx. 26-28.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":20,"verses":[26]}]}]},{"text":"24. And now do you in your turn answer me these questions. How do you explain the fact that Thomas felt the hands of the risen Lord and beheld His side pierced by the spear?[fn-41-P4127_1112589:2977-nf] And the fact that Peter saw the Lord standing on the shore[fn-41-P4128_1112670:2978-nf] and eating a piece of a roasted fish and a honeycomb.[fn-41-P4129_1112764:2979-nf] If He stood, He must certainly have had feet. If He pointed to His wounded side He must have also had chest and belly for to these the sides are attached and without them they cannot be. If He spoke, He must have used a tongue and palate and teeth. For as the bow strikes the strings, so to produce vocal sound does the tongue come in contact with the teeth. If His hands were felt, it follows that He must have had arms as well. Since therefore it is admitted that He had all the members which go to make up the body, He must have also had the whole body formed of them, and that not a woman's but a man's; that is to say, He rose again in the sex in which He died. And if you cavil farther and say: We shall eat then, I suppose, after the resurrection; or How can a solid and material body enter in contrary to its nature through closed doors? you shall receive from me this reply. Do not for this matter of food find fault with belief in the resurrection: for our Lord after raising the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue commanded food to be given her.[fn-41-P4130_1113846:2980-nf] And Lazarus who had been dead four days is described as sitting at meat with Him,[fn-41-P4131_1113950:2981-nf] the object in both cases being to shew that the resurrection was real and not merely apparent. And if from our Lord's entering in through closed doors[fn-41-P4132_1114123:2982-nf] you strive to prove that His body was spiritual and aerial, He must have had this spiritual body even before He suffered; since-contrary to the nature of heavy bodies-He was able to walk upon the sea.[fn-41-P4133_1114348:2983-nf] The apostle Peter also must be believed to have had a spiritual body for he also walked upon the waters with buoyant step.[fn-41-P4134_1114495:2984-nf] The true explanation is that when anything is done against nature, it is a manifestation of God's might and power. And to shew plainly that in these great signs our attention is asked not to a change in nature but to the almighty power of God, he who by faith had walked on water began to sink for the want of it and would have done so had not the Lord lifted him up with the reproving words, \"O thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt?\"[fn-41-P4135_1114965:2985-nf] I wonder that you can display such effrontery when the Lord Himself said, \"reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless but believing.\"[fn-41-P4136_1115199:2986-nf] and in another place, \"behold my hands and my feet that it is I myself: handle me and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have.

She was slow to speak and swift to hear,[fn-41-P4146_1117721:2993-nf] remembering the precept, \"Keep silence and hearken, O Israel.\"[fn-41-P4147_1117814:2994-nf] The holy scriptures she knew by heart, and said of the history contained in them that it was the foundation of the truth; but, though she loved even this, she still preferred to seek for the underlying spiritual meaning and made this the keystone of the spiritual building raised within her soul. She asked leave that she and her daughter might read over the old and new testaments[fn-41-P4148_1118236:2995-nf] under my guidance. Out of modesty I at first refused compliance, but as she persisted in her demand and frequently urged me to consent to it, I at last did so and taught her what I had learned not from myself-for self-confidence is the worst of teachers-but from the church's most famous writers. Wherever I stuck fast and honestly confessed myself at fault she would by no means rest content but would force me by fresh questions to point out to her which of many different solutions seemed to me the most probable. I will mention here another fact which to those who are envious may well seem incredible. While I myself beginning as a young man have with much toil and effort partially acquired the Hebrew tongue and study it now unceasingly lest if I leave it, it also may leave me; Paula, on making up her mind that she too would learn it, succeeded so well that she could chant the psalms in Hebrew and could speak the language without a trace of the pronunciation peculiar to Latin. The same accomplishment can be seen to this day in her daughter Eustochium, who always kept close to her mother's side, obeyed all her commands, never slept apart from her, never walked abroad or took a meal without her never had a penny that she could call her own, rejoiced when her mother gave to the poor her little patrimony, and fully believed that in filial affection she had the best heritage and the truest riches. I must not pass over in silence the joy which Paula felt when she heard her little granddaughter and namesake, the child of Laeta and Toxotius-who was born and I may even say conceived in answer to a vow of her parents dedicating her to virginity-when, I say, she heard the little one in her cradle sing \"alleluia\" and falter out the words \"grandmother\" and \"aunt.\" One wish alone made her long to see her native land again; that she might know her son and his wife and child[fn-41-P4149_1120189:2996-nf] to have renounced the world and to be serving Christ. And it has been granted to her in part. For while her granddaughter is destined to take the veil, her daughter-in-law has vowed herself to perpetual chastity, and by faith and alms emulates the example that her mother has set her. She strives to exhibit at Rome the virtues which Paula set forth in all their fulness at Jerusalem.","index":"1121","references":[{"fn":"41","code":"P4146_1117721","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Deut. xxvii. 9, R.V.","bible_refs":[{"book":"deuteronomy","chapter":27,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"41","code":"P4147_1117814","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Vetus et novurn instrumentum.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"41","code":"P4148_1118236","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Toxotius, Laeta, the younger Paula.

Lastly I must say this that even if your own consciences acquit you of misdoing, yet the very rumour of such brings disgrace upon you. Mother and daughter are names of affection; they imply natural ties and reciprocal duties; they form the closest of human relations after that which binds the soul to God. If you love each other, your conduct calls for no praise: but if you hate each other, you have committed a crime. The Lord Jesus was subject to His parents.[fn-42-P4283_1153750:3057-nf] He reverenced that mother of whom He was Himself the parent; He respected the foster-father whom He had Himself fostered; for He remembered that He had been carried in the womb of the one and in the arms of the other.

Well, I shall say no more to the mother, for perhaps age, weakness, and loneliness make sufficient excuses for her; but to you the daughter I say: \"Is a mother's house too small for you whose womb was not too small? When you have lived with her for ten months in the one, can you not bear to live with her for one day in the other? or are you unable to meet her gaze? Can it be that one who has borne you and reared you, who has brought you up and knows you, is dreaded by you as a witness of your homelife? If you are a true virgin, why do you fear her careful guardianship; and, if you have fallen, why do you not openly marry? Wedlock is like a plank offered to a shipwrecked man and by its means you may remedy what previously you have done amiss. I do not mean that you are not to repent of your sin or that you are to continue in evil courses; but, when a tie of the kind has been formed, I despair of breaking it altogether. However, a return to your mother will make it easier for you to bewail the virginity which you have lost through leaving her. Or if you are still unspotted and have not lost your chastity, be careful of it for you may lose it. Why must you live in a house where you must daily struggle for life and death? Can any one sleep soundly with a viper near him? No; for, though it may not attack him it is sure to frighten him. It is better to be where there is no danger, than to be in danger and to escape. In the one case we have a calm; in the other careful steering is necessary. In the one case we are filled with joy; in the other we do but avoid sorrow.","index":"1186","references":[]},{"text":"4. But you will perhaps reply: \"my mother is not well-behaved, she desires the things of the world, she loves riches, she disregards fasting, she stains her eyes with antimony, she likes to walk abroad in gay attire, she hinders me from the monastic vow, and so I cannot live with her.\" But first of all, even though she is as you say, you will have the greater reward for refusing to forsake her with all her faults. She has carried you in her womb, she has reared you; with gentle affection she has borne with the troublesome ways of your childhood. She has washed your linen, she has tended you when sick, and the sickness of maternity was not only borne for you but caused by you. She has brought you up to womanhood, she has taught you to love Christ. You ought not to be displeased with the behaviour of a mother who has consecrated you as a virgin to the service of your spouse. Still if you cannot put up with her dainty ways and feel obliged to shun them, and if your mother really is, as people so often say, a woman of the world, you have others, virgins like yourself, the holy company of chastity. Why, when you forsake your mother, do you choose for companion a man who perhaps has left behind him a sister and mother of his own? You tell me that she is hard to get on with and that he is easy; that she is quarrelsome and that he is amiable. I will ask you one question: Did you go straight from your home to the man, or did you fall in with him afterwards? If you went straight to him, the reason why you left your mother is plain. If you fell in with him afterwards, you shew by your choice what you missed under your mother's roof.[fn-42-P4287_1157407:3059-nf] The pain that I inflict is severe and I feel the knife as much as you. \"He that walketh uprightly walketh surely.\"[fn-42-P4288_1157551:3060-nf] Only that my conscience would smite me, I should keep silence and be slow to blame others where I am not guiltless myself. Having a beam in my own eye I should be reluctant to see the mote in my neighbour's. But as it is I live far away among Christian brothers; my life with them is honourable as eyewitnesses of it can testify; I rarely see, or am seen by, others. It is most shameless, therefore, in you to refuse to copy me in respect of self-restraint, when you profess to take me as your model. If you say: \"my conscience is enough for me too. God is my judge who is witness of my life.

He welcomes both and respects both.A daughter may be as religious as she pleases; still a mother who is a widow is a guaranty for her chastity. If this person whoever he is is of the same age with yourself, he should honour your mother as though she were his own; and, if he is older, he should love you as a daughter and subject you to a mother's discipline. It is not good either for your reputation or for his that he should like you more than your mother; for his affection might appear to be less for you than for your youth. This is what I should say if a monk were not your brother and if you had no relatives able to protect you. But what excuse has a stranger for thrusting himself in where there are both a mother and a brother, the one a widow and the other a monk? It is good for you to feel that you are a daughter and a sister. However, if you cannot manage both, and if your mother is too hard a morsel to swallow, your brother at any rate should satisfy you. Or, if he is too harsh, she that bore you may prove more gentle. Why do you turn pale? Why do you get excited? Why do you blush, and with trembling lips betray the restlessness of your mind?

Shameless as you may be, you will hardly venture to flaunt him in the eyes of the world. If you ever do so, your whole circle will cry out about both you and him; every one's finger will be pointed at you; and your cousins who in your presence to please you call him a monk and a man of religion, will laugh at you behind your back for having such an unnatural husband.

To make you drink wine they will praise it as a creature of God. To induce you to take baths they will speak of dirt with disgust; and, when on second thoughts you do as you are bid, they will with one voice salute you as spotless and open, a thorough lady. Meantime some singer will give to the company a selection of softly flowing airs; and as he will not venture to look at other men's wives, he will constantly fix his eyes on you who have no protector. He will speak by nods and convey by his tone what he is afraid to put into words. Amid inducements to sensuality so marked as these, even iron wills are apt to be overcome with desire; an appetite which is the more imperious in virgins because they suppose. that sweetest of which they have no experience.

Wherefore they who are rich find it hard to enter the kingdom of heaven, a kingdom which desires for its citizens souls that soar aloft free from all ties and hindrances. \"Go thy way,\" the Lord says, \"and sell\" not a part of thy substance but \"all that thou hast, and give to the poor;\" not to thy friends or kinsfolk or relatives, not to thy wife or to thy children.

When once you have put your hand to the plough you must not look back;[fn-43-P4341_1184552:3092-nf] when once you stand on the housetop you must think no more of your clothes within; to escape your Egyptian mistress[fn-43-P4342_1184690:3093-nf] you must abandon the cloak that belongs to this world.

Nor may you excuse yourself on the score of your noble station and the responsibilities of wealth. Look at Pammachius and at Paulinus that presbyter of glowing faith both of whom have offered to the Lord not only their riches but themselves. In spite of the devil and his shuffling they have by no means given skin for skin, but have consecrated their own flesh and bones, yea and their very souls unto the Lord. Surely these may lead you to higher things both by their example and by their preaching, that is, by their deeds and words. You are of noble birth, so are they: but in Christ they are made nobler still. You are rich and held in repute, so once were they: but now instead of being rich and held in repute they are poor and obscure, yet, because it is for Christ's sake, they are really richer and more famous than ever. You too, it is true, shew yourself beneficent, you are said to minister to the wants of the saints, to entertain monks, and to present large sums of money to churches. This however is only the a b c of your soldiership. You despise money; the world's philosophers have done the same. One of these[fn-43-P4347_1187442:3097-nf] -to say nothing of the rest-cast the price of many possessions into the sea, saying as he did so \"To the bottom with you, ye provokers of evil lusts. I shall drown you in the sea that you may never drown me in sin.\" If then a philosopher-a creature of vanity whom popular applause can buy and sell-laid down all his burthen at once, how can you think that you have reached virtue's crowning height when you have yielded up but a portion of yours? It is you yourself that the Lord wishes for, \"a living sacrifice ...acceptable unto God.\"[fn-43-P4348_1188006:3098-nf] Yourself, I say, and not what you have. And therefore, as he trained Israel by subjecting it to many plagues and afflictions, so does He now admonish you by sending you trials of different kinds. \"For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.\"[fn-43-P4349_1188309:3099-nf] The poor widow did but cast two mites into the treasury; yet because she cast in all that she had it is said of her that she surpassed all the rich in offering gifts to God.[fn-43-P4350_1188505:3100-nf] Such gifts are valued not by their weight but by the good-will with which they are made. You may have spent your substance upon numbers of people, and a portion of your fellows may have reason to rejoice in your bounty; yet those who have received nothing at your hands are still more numerous. Neither the wealth of Darius nor the riches of Croesus would suffice to satisfy the wants of the world's poor. But if you once give yourself to the Lord and resolve to follow the Saviour in the perfection of apostolic virtue, then you will come to see what your place has hitherto been, and how you have lagged in the rear of Christ's army. Hardly had you begun to mourn for your dead daughters when the fear of Christ dried the tears of paternal affection upon your cheeks. It was a great triumph of faith, true. But how much greater was that won by Abraham who was content to slay his only son, of whom he had been told that he was to inherit the world, yet did not cease to hope that after death Isaac would live again.[fn-43-P4351_1189560:3101-nf] Jephthah too offered up his virgin daughter, and for this is placed by the apostle in the roll of the saints.[fn-43-P4352_1189699:3102-nf] I would not therefore have you offer to the Lord only what a thief may steal from you or an enemy fall upon, or a proscription confiscate, what is liable to fluctuations in value now going up and now down, what belongs to a succession of masters who follow each other as fast as in the sea wave follows wave, and-to say everything in a word-what, whether you like it or not, you must leave behind you when you die. Rather offer to God that which no enemy can carry off and no tyrant take from you, which will go down with you into the grave, nay on to the kingdom of heaven and the enchantments of paradise. You already build monasteries and support in the various islands of Dalmatia a large number of holy men. But you would do better still if you were to live among these holy men usa holy man yourself. \"Be ye holy, saith the Lord, for I am holy.\"[fn-43-P4353_1190590:3103-nf] The apostles boasted that they had left all things and had followed the Saviour.\"[fn-43-P4354_1190708:3104-nf] We do not read that they left anything except their ship and their nets; yet they were crowned with the approval of Him who was to be their judge.

Not content with assuring her own salvation she has sought yours also, in former days at home and now in the holy places.

In fact when he left the dark valleys in which Sodom lay and came to the mountains, the sun rose upon him as he entered Zoar or the little City; so-called because the little faith that Lot possessed, though unable to save greater places, was at least able to preserve smaller ones.

Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live,\" and again, \"turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?\"[fn-44-P4416_1202467:3126-nf] Nothing makes God so angry as when men from despair of better things cleave to those which are worse; and indeed this despair in itself is a sign of unbelief. One who despairs of salvation can have no expectation of a judgment to come. For if he dreaded such, he would by doing good works prepare to meet his Judge. Let us hear what God says through Jeremiah, \"withhold thy foot from a rough way and thy throat from thirst\"[fn-44-P4417_1202936:3127-nf] and again \"shall they fall, and not arise? Shall he turn away, and not return?\"[fn-44-P4418_1203043:3128-nf] Let us hear also what God says by Isaiah: \"When thou shalt turn and bewail thyself, then shall thou be saved, and then shalt thou know where thou hast hitherto been.\"[fn-44-P4419_1203233:3129-nf] We do not realize the miseries of sickness till returning health reveals them to us. So sins serve as a foil to the blessedness of virtue; and light shines more brightly when it is relieved against darkness. Ezekiel uses language like that of the other prophets because he is animated by a similar spirit. \"Repent,\" he cries, \"and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. Cast away from you all your transgressions whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel? For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord.\"[fn-44-P4420_1203902:3130-nf] Wherefore in a subsequent passage he says: \"As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked: but that the wicked turn from his way and live.\"[fn-44-P4421_1204103:3131-nf] These words shew us that the mind must not through disbelief in the promised blessings give way to despair; and that the soul once marked out for perdition must not refuse to apply remedies on the ground that its wounds are past curing. Ezekiel describes God as swearing, that if we refuse to believe His promise in regard to our salvation we may at least believe His oath. It is with full confidence that the righteous man prays and says, \"Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease,\"[fn-44-P4422_1204647:3132-nf] and again, \"Lord, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face and I was troubled.\"[fn-44-P4423_1204792:3133-nf] He means to say, \"when I forsook the foulness of my faults for the beauty of virtue, God strengthened my weakness with His grace.\" Lo, I hear. His promise: \"I will pursue mine enemies and overtake them: neither will I turn again till they are consumed,\"[fn-44-P4424_1205067:3134-nf] so that I who was once thine enemy and a fugitive from thee, shall be laid hold of by thine hand. Cease not from pursuing me till my wickedness is consumed, and I return to my old husband who will give me my wool and my flax, my oil and my fine flour and will feed me with the richest foods.[fn-44-P4425_1205388:3135-nf] He it was who hedged up and enclosed my evil ways[fn-44-P4426_1205461:3136-nf] that I might find Him the true way who says in the gospel, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life.\"[fn-44-P4427_1205582:3137-nf] Hear the words of the prophet: \"they that sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.\"[fn-44-P4428_1205809:3138-nf] Say also with him: \"All the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears\"[fn-44-P4429_1205935:3139-nf] : and again, \"As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God? My tears have been my meat day and night,\"[fn-44-P4430_1206182:3140-nf] and in another place, \"O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and weary land where no water is. So have I looked upon thee in the sanctuary.\"[fn-44-P4431_1206420:3141-nf] For although my soul has thirsted after thee, yet much more have I sought thee by the labour of my flesh and have not been able to look upon thee in thy sanctuary; not at any rate till I have first dwelt in a land barren of sin, where the weary wayfarer is no more assailed by the adversary, and where there are no pools or rivers of lust.","index":"1244","references":[{"fn":"44","code":"P4402_1198884","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"This lady lived in Gaul and was a diligent student of scripture.

As for instance these: that a woman must not bring discredit upon her profession of widowhood by too great attention to her dress, that she must not draw troops of young men after her by gay smiles or expressive glances, that she must not profess one thing by her words and another by her behaviour, that she must give no ground for the application to herself of the well known line:","index":"1262","references":[{"fn":"45","code":"P4535_1230733","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1 Tim. v. 14, 1 Tim. v. 15.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 timothy","chapter":5,"verses":[14]}]},{"fn":"45","code":"P4536_1230939","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"So Vulg.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"She gave a meaning look and slyly smiled.[fn-45-P4538_1231847:3228-nf] Lastly, that Paul may compress into a few words all the reasons for such marriages, he shews the motive of his command by saying: \"for some are already turned aside after Satan.\"Thus he allows to the incontinent a second marriage, or in case of need a third, simply that he may rescue them from Satan, preferring that a woman should be joined to the worst of husbands rather than to the devil.To the Corinthians he uses somewhat similar language: \"I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.

For though the epistles are different, they are the work of one author. While her husband lives the woman is bound, and when he is dead, she is loosed. Marriage then is a bond, and widowhood is the loosing of it. The wife is bound to the husband and the husband to the wife; and so close is the tie that they have no power over their own bodies, but each stands indebted to the other. They who are under the yoke of wedlock have not the option of choosing continence. When the apostle adds the words \"only in the Lord,\" he excludes heathen marriages of which he had spoken in another place thus: \"be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? and what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? and what agreement hath the temple of God with idols?\"[fn-45-P4544_1234299:3233-nf] We must not plough with an ox and an ass together;[fn-45-P4545_1234377:3234-nf] nor weave our wedding garment of different colours.

Again, no widow of youthful age must quiet her qualms of conscience by the plea that he gives commandment that no widow is to be taken into the number under three-score years old.[fn-45-P4547_1235128:3235-nf] He does not by this arrangement urge unmarried girls or youthful widows to marry, seeing that even of the married he says: \"the time is short: it remaineth that they that have wives be as though they had none.\"[fn-45-P4548_1235361:3236-nf] No, he is speaking of widows who have relations able to support them, who have sons and grandsons to be responsible for their maintenance. The apostle commands these latter to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents and to relieve them adequately; that the church may not be charged, but may be free to relieve those that are widows indeed. \"Honour widows,\" he writes, \"that are widows indeed,\" that is, such as are desolate and have no relations to help them, who cannot labour with their hands, who are weakened by poverty and overcome by years, whose trust is in God and their only work prayer.[fn-45-P4549_1235993:3237-nf] From which it is easy to infer that the younger widows, unless they are excused by ill health, are either left to their own exertions or else are consigned to the care of their children or relations. The word `honour' in this passage implies either alms or a gift, as also in the verse immediately following: \"Let the elders ...be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.\"[fn-45-P4550_1236447:3238-nf] So also in the gospel when the Lord discusses that commandment of the Law which says: \"Honour thy father and thy mother,\"[fn-45-P4551_1236592:3239-nf] He declares that it is to be interpreted not of mere words which while offering an empty shew of regard may still leave a parent's wants unrelieved, but of the actual provision of the necessaries of life. The Lord commanded that poor parents should be supported by their children and that these should pay them back when old those benefits which they had themselves received in their childhood. The scribes and pharisees on the other hand taught the children to answer their parents by saying: \"It is Corban, that is to say, a gift[fn-45-P4552_1237146:3240-nf] which I have promised to the altar and engaged to present to the temple: it will relieve you as much there, as if I were to give it you directly to buy food.\"[fn-45-P4553_1237328:3241-nf] So it frequently happened that while father and mother were destitute their children were offering sacrifices for the priests and scribes to consume. If then the apostle compels poor widows-yet only those who are young and not broken down by sickness-to labour with their hands that the church, not charged with their maintenance, may be able to support such widows as are old, what plea can be urged by one who has abundance of this world's goods, both for her own wants and those of others, and who can make to herself friends of the mammon of unrighteousness able to receive her into everlasting habitations?[fn-45-P4554_1238016:3242-nf] ","index":"1265","references":[{"fn":"45","code":"P4547_1235128","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1 Tim. v. 9.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 timothy","chapter":5,"verses":[9]}]},{"fn":"45","code":"P4548_1235361","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1 Cor. vii. 29.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 corinthians","chapter":7,"verses":[29]}]},{"fn":"45","code":"P4549_1235993","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1 Tim. v. 3-5, 1 Tim. v. 16.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 timothy","chapter":5,"verses":[3]}]},{"fn":"45","code":"P4550_1236447","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1 Tim. v. 17.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 timothy","chapter":5,"verses":[17]}]},{"fn":"45","code":"P4551_1236592","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Ex. xx. 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"exodus","chapter":20,"verses":[12]}]},{"fn":"45","code":"P4552_1237146","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Mark vii. 11.","bible_refs":[{"book":"mark","chapter":7,"verses":[11]}]},{"fn":"45","code":"P4553_1237328","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Text corrupt: probably `quasi\f0' should be substituted for `si.\f0'","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"45","code":"P4554_1238016","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Cf.

But when he sees unstable men in danger through their incontinence of falling into the abyss of lust, he extends to them the offer of a second marriage; that, if they must wallow in the mire, it may be with one and not with many. The husband of a second wife must not consider this a harsh saying or one that conflicts with the rule laid down by the apostle. The apostle is of two minds: first, he proclaims a command, \"I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.\" Next. he makes a concession, \"But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.\"[fn-45-P4558_1239852:3244-nf] He first shews what he himself desires, then that in which he is forced to acquiesce. He wishes us-after one marriage-to abide even as he, that is, unmarried, and sets before us in his own apostolic example an instance of the blessedness of which he speaks. If however he finds that we are unwilling to do as he wishes, he makes a concession to our incontinence. Which then of the two alternatives do we choose for ourselves? The one which he prefers and which is in itself good? Or the one which in comparison with evil is tolerable, yet as it is only a substitute for evil is not altogether good?

The man had already buried twenty wives, and the woman had had twenty-two husbands. Now they were united to each other as each believed for the last time.

You cannot too closely imitate your grandmother, your mother, and your aunt; whose teaching and advice as to life will form for you a rule of virtue.

Then, when he comes to deal with rational creatures and to describe their lapse into earthly bodies as due to their own negligence, he goes on to say: \"Surely it argues great negligence and sloth for a soul so far to empty itself as to fall into sin and allow itself to be tied to the material body of an unreasoning brute;\" and in a subsequent passage: \"These reasonings induce me to suppose that it is by their own free act that some are numbered with God's saints and servants, and that it was through their own fault that others fell from holiness into such negligence that they were changed into forces of an opposite kind.\"[fn-47-P4718_1277010:3365-nf] He maintains that after every end a fresh beginning springs forth and an end from each beginning, and that wholesale variation is possible; so that one who is now a human being may in another world become a demon, while one who by reason of his negligence is now a demon may hereafter be placed in a more material body and thus become a human being.[fn-47-P4719_1277385:3366-nf] So far does he carry this transforming process that on his theory an archangel may become the devil and the devil in turn be changed back into an archangel. \"Such as have wavered or faltered but have not altogether fallen shall be made subject, for rule and government and guidance, to better things-to principalities and powers, to thrones and dominations\"; and of these perhaps another human race will be formed, when in the words of Isaiah there shall be \"new heavens and a new earth.'[fn-47-P4720_1277899:3367-nf] But such as have not deserved to return through humanity to their former estate shall become the devil and his angels, demons of the worst sort; and according to what they have done shall havespecial duties assigned to them in particular worlds.\" Moreover, the very demons and rulers of darkness in any world or worlds, if they are willing to turn to better things, may become human beings and so come back to their first beginning. That is to say, after they have borne the discipline of punishment and torture for a longer or a shorter time in human bodies, they may again reach the angelic pinnacles from which they have fallen. Hence it may be shewn that we men may change into any other reasonable beings, and that not once only or on emergency but time after time; we and angels shall become demons if we neglect our duty; and demons, if they will take to themselves virtues, may attain to the rank of angels.","index":"1305","references":[{"fn":"47","code":"P4718_1277010","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"F.

Bodily substances too are to pass away utterly or else at the end of all things will become highly rarified like the sky and aether and other subtle bodies. It is clear that these principles must affect the writer's view of the resurrection. The sun also and the moon and the rest of the constellations are alive. Nay more; as we men by reason of our sins are enveloped in bodies material and sluggish; so the lights of heaven have for like reasons received bodies more or less luminous, and demons have been for more serious faults clothed with starry frames. This, he argues, is the view of the apostle who writes:-\"the creation has been subjected to vanity and shall be delivered for the revealing of the sons of God.\"[fn-47-P4722_1279562:3368-nf] That it may not be supposed that I am imputing to him ideas of my own I shall give his actual words. \"At the end and consummation of the world,\" he writes, \"when souls and beings endowed with reason shall be released from prison by the Lord, they will move slowly or fly quickly according as they have previously been slothful or energetic. And as all of them have free will and are freeto choose virtue or vice, those who choose the latter will be much worse off than they now are. But those who choose the former will improve their condition. Their movements and decisions in this direction or in that will determine their various futures; whether, that is, angels are to become men or demons, and whether demons are to become men or angels.\" Then after adducing various arguments in support of his thesis and maintaining that while not incapable of virtue the devil has yet not chosen to be virtuous, he has Finally reasoned with much diffuseness that an angel, a human soul, and a demon-all according tohim of one nature but of different wills-may in punishment for great negligence or folly be transformed into brutes. Moreover, to avoid the agony of punishment and the burning flame the more sensitive may choose to become loworganisms, to dwell in water, to assume the shape of this or that animal; so that we have reason to fear a metamorphosis not only into four-footed things but even into fishes. Then, lest he should be held guilty of maintaining with Pythagoras the transmigration of souls, he winds up the wicked reasoning with which he has wounded his reader by saying: \"I must not be taken to make dogmas of these things; they are only thrown out as conjectures to shew that they are not altogether overlooked.\"","index":"1306","references":[{"fn":"47","code":"P4722_1279562","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Rom. viii. 19-21, R.V.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":8,"verses":[19]}]}]},{"text":"5. In his second book he maintains a plurality of worlds; not, however, as Epicurus taught, many like ones existing at once, but a new one beginning each time that the old comes to an end. There was a world before this world of ours, and after it there will be first one and then another and so on in regular succession. He is in doubt whether one world shall be so completely similar to another as to leave no room for any difference between them, or whether one world shall never wholly be indistinguishable from another. And again a little farther on he writes: \"if, as the course of the discussion makes necessary, all things can live without body, all bodily existence shall be swallowed up and that which once has been made out of nothing shall again be reduced to nothing. And yet a time will come when its use will be once more necessary.\" And in the same context: \"but if, as reason and the authority of scripture shew, this corruptible shall put on incorruption and this mortal shall put on immortality, death shall be swallowed up in victory and corruption in incorruption.[fn-47-P4724_1282407:3369-nf] And it may be that all bodily existence shall be removed, for it is only in this that death can operate.\" And a little farther on: \"if these things are not contrary to the faith, it may be that we shall some day live in a disembodied state. Moreover, if only he is fully subject to Christ who is disembodied, and if all must be made subject to Him, we too shall lose our bodies when we become fully subject to Him.\" And in the same passage: \"if all are to be made subject to God, all shall lay aside their bodies; and then all bodily existence shall be brought to nought. But if through the fall of reasonable beings it is a second time required it will reappear. For God has left souls to strive and struggle, to teach them that full and complete victory is to be attained not by their own efforts but by His grace.

In speaking thus does he not most clearly follow the error of the heathen and foist upon the simple faith of Christians the ravings of philosophy?

But if He is by nature invisible, He must beso even to the Saviour.\" And lower down: \"no soul which has descended into a human body has borne upon it so true an impress of its previous character as Christ's soul of which He says: `no man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself.'\"[fn-47-P4728_1284793:3372-nf] And in another place: \"we must carefully consider whether souls, when they have won salvation and have attained to the blessed life, may not cease to be souls. For as the Lord and Saviour came to seek and to save that which was lost[fn-47-P4729_1285047:3373-nf] that it might cease to be lost; so the lost soul which the Lord came to save, when saved, will cease to be a soul. We must ask ourselves whether, as the lost was not lost once and again will not be, the soul likewise may have been and again may be not a soul.\"[fn-47-P4730_1285331:3374-nf] And after a good many remarks upon the soul he brings in the following, \"nouj or\" intelligence by falling becomes a soul; and by acquiring virtue this will become intelligence again. This at least is a fair inference from the case of Esau who for his old sins is condemned to lead a lower life. And concerning the heavenly bodies we must make a similar acknowledgment. The soul of the sun-or whatever else you like to call it-does not date its existence from the creation of the world; it already existed before it entered its shining and glowing body. So also with the moon and stars. From antecedent causes they have been made subject to vanity not willingly but for future reward,[fn-47-P4731_1286149:3375-nf] and are forced to do not their own will but the creator's who has assigned to them their several spheres.\"7. Hellfire, moreover, and the torments with which holy scripture threatens sinners he explains not as external punishments but as the pangs of guilty consciences when by God's power the memory of our transgressions is set before our eyes. \"The whole crop of our sins grows up afresh from seeds which remain in the soul, and all our dishonourable and undutiful acts are again pictured before our gaze. Thus it is the fire of conscience and the stings of remorse which torture the mind as it looks back on former self-indulgence.\" And again: \"but perhaps this coarse and earthly body ought to be described as mist and darkness; for at the end of this world and when it becomes necessary to pass into another, the like darkness will lead to the like physical birth.\" In speaking thus he clearly pleads for the transmigration of souls as taught by Pythagoras and Plato.[fn-47-P4732_1287147:3376-nf] . And at the end of the second book in dealing with our perfection he has said: \"when we shall have made such progress as not only to cease to be flesh or body but perhaps also to cease to be souls our perfect intelligence and perception, undimmed with any mist of passion, will discern reasonable and intelligible substances face to face.","index":"1308","references":[{"fn":"47","code":"P4728_1284793","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Joh. x. 18.","bible_refs":[{"book":"john","chapter":10,"verses":[18]}]},{"fn":"47","code":"P4729_1285047","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Luke xix. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":19,"verses":[10]}]},{"fn":"47","code":"P4730_1285331","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"The paralogism in this reasoning-so obvious to modern minds-is due to the confusion of the copula with the verb substantive.","bible_refs":[]},{"fn":"47","code":"P4731_1286149","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Rom. viii. 20.","bible_refs":[{"book":"romans","chapter":8,"verses":[20]}]},{"fn":"47","code":"P4732_1287147","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Phaedo, 70-77.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"8.

In the same book he writes: \"this too must be considered; why the human soul is diversely acted upon now by influences of one kind and now by influences of another.\" And he surmises that this is due to conduct which has preceded birth. It is for this, he argues, that John leaps in his mother's womb when at Mary's salutation Elizabeth declares herself unworthy of her notice.[fn-47-P4738_1289748:3381-nf] And he immediately subjoins: \"on the other hand infants that are hardly weaned are possessed with evil spirits and become diviners and soothsayers;[fn-47-P4739_1289917:3382-nf] indeed, some are indwelt from their earliest years with the spirit of a python.

Listen to the Preacher who says: `the thing which hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. Is there anything whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.'[fn-47-P4742_1291049:3384-nf] A passage which proves not only that other worlds have been but that other worlds shall be; not, however, simultaneously and side by side but one after another.\" And he immediately adds: \"I hold that heaven is the abode of the deity, the true place of rest; and that it was there that reasonable creatures enjoyed their ancient bliss, before coming down to a lower plane and exchanging the invisible for the visible, they fell to the earth and came to need material bodies. Now that they have fallen, God the creator has made for them bodies suitable to their surroundings; and has fashioned this visible world, and has sent into it ministers to ensure the salvation and correction of the fallen. Of these ministers some have held assigned positions and have been subject to the world's necessary laws; while others have intelligently performed duties laid upon them in times and seasons determined by God's plan. To the former class belong the sun, moon, and stars called by the apostle `the creation;' and these have had allotted to them the heights of heaven. Now the creation is subjected to vanity[fn-47-P4743_1292191:3385-nf] because it is encased in material bodies and visible to the eye. And yet it is `made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope.' Others again of the second class, at particular places and times known to their Maker only, we believe to be His angels sent to steer the world.\" A little farther on he says: \"the affairs of the world are so ordered by Providence that while some angels fall from heaven others freely glide down to earth. The former are hurled down against their will; the latter descend from choice alone. The former are forced to continue in a distasteful service for a fixed period; the latter spontaneously embrace the task of lending a hand to those who fall.\" Again he writes: \"whence it follows that these different movements result in the creation of different worlds; and that this world of ours will be succeeded by one quite unlike it. Now, as regards this falling and rising, this rewarding of virtue and punishment of vice, whether they take place in the past, present, or future, God, the creator, can alone apportion desert and make all things converge to one end.

Now there can be no doubt but that, if bodies or, as the apostle calls them, visible things, belong only to our sensible world, the life of the disembodied will be incorporeal.\" And a little farther on: \"when the apostle writes, `the creation shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God,'[fn-47-P4745_1294279:3386-nf] I explain his words thus. Reasonable and incorporeal beings are the highest of God's creatures, for not being clothed with bodies they are not the slaves of corruption. Since where there are bodies, there corruption is sure to be found. But hereafter `the creation shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption,' and then men shall receive the glory of the children of God and God shall be all in all.\" And in the same passage he writes: \"that the final state will be an incorporeal one is rendered credible by the words of our Saviour's prayer: `as thou, Father, art in me and I in thee, that they also may be one in us.'[fn-47-P4746_1294935:3387-nf] For we ought to realize what God is and what the Saviour will finally be, and how the likeness to the Father and the Son here promised to the Saints consists in this that as They are one in Themselves so we shall be one in Them. For if in the end the life of the Saints is to be assimilated to the life of God, we must either admit that the Lord of the universe is clothed with a body and that he is enveloped in matter as we are in flesh; or, if it is unbecoming to suppose this, especially in persons who have but small clues from which to infer God's majesty and to guess at the glory of His innate and transcendent nature, we are reduced to the following dilemma.

These passages prove what his view is regarding the resurrection. For he evidently maintains that all bodies will perish and that we shall be incorporeal as according to him we were before we received our present bodies. Again when he comes to argue for a variety of worlds and to maintain that angels will become demons, demons either angels or men, and men in their turn demons; in a word that everything will be turned into something else, he thus sums up his own opinion: \"no doubt, after an interval matter will exist afresh and bodies will be formed and a different world will be created to meet the varying wills of reasonable beings who, having forfeited the perfect bliss which continues to the end, have gradually fallen into so great wickedness as to change their nature and refuse to keep their first estate of unalloyed blessedness. Many reasonable beings, it is right to say, keep it until a second, a third, and a fourth world, and give God no ground for changing their condition. Others deteriorate so little that they seem to have lost hardly anything, and others again have to be hurled headlong into the abyss. God who orders all things alone knows how to use each class according to its deserts in a suitable sphere; for He only understands opportunities and motives and the course in which the world must be steered. Thus one who has borne away the palm for wickedness and has sunk into the lowest degradation will in the world which is hereafter to be fashioned be made a devil, a kind of first fruits of the Lord's handiwork, to be a laughing stock to the angels who have lost their first virtue.\" What is this but to argue that the sinful men of this world may become a devil and demons in another; and contrariwise that those who are now demons may hereafter become either men or angels? And after a lengthy discussion in which he maintains that all corporeal creatures must exchange their material for subtle and spiritual bodies and that all substance must become one pure and inconceivably bright body, of which the human mind can at present form no conception, he winds up thus:-\"`God shall be all in all;' that is to say, all bodily existence shall be made as perfect as possible; it shall be brought into the divine essence, than which there is none better.\"","index":"1312","references":[]},{"text":"12. In the fourth and last book of his work the following passages deserve the church's condemnation. \"It may be that as, when men die in this world by the separation of soul and body, they are allotted different positions in hell according to the difference in their works; so when angels die, out of the system of the heavenly Jerusalem, they come down to this world as a hell and are placed on earth according to their deserts.\" And again: \"as we have compared the souls which pass from this world to hell with those which as they come from heaven to us are in a manner dead; so we must carefully inquire whether this is true of all souls without exception. For in that case souls born on earth when they desire better things rise out of hell and assume human bodies or when they desire worse things come down to us from better worlds; and in the firmament above us likewise there are souls on their way from our world to higher ones, and others who, while they have fallen from heaven, have not sinned so grievously as to be thrust down to earth.\"He thus tries to prove that the firmament, that is the sky, is hell compared with heaven; and that this earth is hell compared with the firmament; and again that our world is heaven to hell.

In loneliness pride quickly creeps upon a man: if he has fasted for a little while and has seen no one, he fancies himself a person of some note; forgetting who he is, whence he comes, and whither he goes, he lets his thoughts riot within and outwardly indulges in rash speech.

What then, you will say? Do I condemn a solitary life? By no means: in fact I have often commended it. But I wish to see the monastic schools turn out soldiers who have no fear of the rough training of the desert, who have exhibited the spectacle of a holy life for a considerable time, who have made themselves last that they might be first, who have not been overcome by hunger or satiety, whose joy is in poverty, who teach virtue by their garb and mien, and who are too conscientious to invent-as some silly men do-monstrous stories of struggles with demons, designed to magnify their heroes in the eyes of the crowd and before all to extort money from it.","index":"1335","references":[{"fn":"48","code":"P4822_1320840","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Cf.

You ask whether it has fallen from heaven, as Pythagoras, all Platonists, and Origen suppose; or whether it is part of God's essence as the Stoics, Manes, and the Spanish Priscillianists hint. Whether souls created long since are kept in God's storehouse as some ecclesiastical writers[fn-49-P4917_1348767:3511-nf] foolishly imagine; or whether they are formed by God and introduced into bodies day by day according to that saying in the Gospel: \"my Father worketh hitherto and I work;\"[fn-49-P4918_1348999:3512-nf] or whether, lastly, they are transmitted by propagation.

Her strength of mind almost passes belief. Though she had silks and jewels freely at her disposal, and though she was surrounded by crowds of eunuchs and serving-women, a bustling household of flattering and attentive domestics, and though the daintiest feasts that the abundance of a large house could supply were daily set before her; she preferred to all these severe fasting, rough clothing, and frugal living.

With these and similar meditations she fed her mind, dreading nothing so much as to offend her grandmother and her mother. Although she was encouraged by their example, she was discouraged by their expressed wish and desire; not indeed that they disapproved of her holy purpose, but that the prize was so great that they did not venture to hope for it, or to aspire to it. Thus this poor novice in Christ's service was sorely perplexed.

These tell me that secretly night after night, though no one knew of it but the virgins dedicated to God in her mother's and grandmother's retinue, Demetrias, refusing sheets of linen and beds of down, spread a rug of goat's hair upon the ground and watered her face with ceaseless tears.

Why do I still delay to relate the sequel? When her wedding day was now close at hand and when a marriage chamber was being got ready for the bride and bridegroom; secretly without any witnesses and with only the night to comfort her, she is said to have nerved herself with such considerations as these: \"What ails you, Demetrias? Why are you so fearful of defending your chastity? What you need is freedom and courage. If you are so panic-stricken in time of peace, what would you do if you were called on to undergo martyrdom? If you cannot bear so much as a frown from your own, how would you steel yourself to face the tribunals of persecutors? If men's examples leave you unmoved, at least gather courage and confidence from the blessed martyr Agnes[fn-50-P5094_1404269:3632-nf] who vanquished the temptations both of youth and of a despot and by her martyrdom hallowed the very name of chastity. Unhappy girl! you know not, you know not to whom your virginity is due. It is not long since you have trembled in the hands of the barbarians and clung to your grandmother and your mother cowering under their cloaks for safety. You have seen yourself a prisoner[fn-50-P5095_1404808:3633-nf] and your chastity not in your own power. You have shuddered at the fierce looks of your enemies; you have seen with secret agony the virgins of God ravished. Your city, once the capital of the world, is now the grave of the Roman people; and will you on the shores of Libya, yourself an exile, accept an exile for a husband? Where will you find a matron to be present at your bridal?[fn-50-P5096_1405250:3634-nf] Whom will you get to escort you home? No tongue but a harsh Punic one will sing for you the wanton Fescennine verses.[fn-50-P5097_1405401:3635-nf] Away with all hesitations! `Perfect love' of God `casteth out fear.'[fn-50-P5098_1405615:3636-nf] Take to yourself the shield of faith, the breastplate of righteousness, the helmet of salvation,[fn-50-P5099_1405736:3637-nf] and sally forth to battle. The preservation of your chastity involves a martyrdom of its own. Why do you fear your grandmother? Why do you dread your mother? Perhaps they may themselves wish for you a course which they do not think you wish for yourself.\" When by these and other arguments she had wrought herself to the necessary pitch of resolution, she cast from her as so many hindrances all her ornaments and worldly attire. Her precious necklaces, costly pearls, and glowing gems she put back in their cases. Then dressing herself in a coarse tunic and throwing over herself a still courser cloak she came in at an unlooked for moment, threw herself down suddenly at her grandmother's knees, and with tears and sobs shewed her what she really was. That staid and holy woman was amazed when she beheld her granddaughter in so strange a dress. Her mother was completely overcome for joy. Both women could hardly believe that true which they had longed to be true.

I must needs give way here and not attempt to describe what defies description. In the effort to explain the greatness of that joy past all belief, the flow of Tully's eloquence would run dry and the bolts poised and hurled by Demosthenes would become spent and fall short. Whatever mind can conceive or speech can interpret of human gladness was seen then. Mother and child, grandmother and granddaughter kissed each other again and again. The two elder women wept copiously for joy, they raised the prostrate girl, they embraced her trembling form. In her purpose they recognized their own mind, and congratulated each other that now a virgin was to make a noble house more noble still by her virginity. She had found they said, a way to benefit her family and to lessen the calamity of the ruin of Rome Good Jesus! What exultation there was all through the house! Many virgins sprouted out at once as shoots from a fruitful stem, and the example set by their patroness and lady was followed by a host both of clients and servants. Virginity was warmly espoused in every house and although those who made profession of it were as regards the flesh of lower rank than Demetrias they sought one reward with her, the reward of chastity. My words are too weak. Every church in Africa danced for joy. The news reached not only the cities, towns, and villages but even the scattered huts. Every island between Africa and Italy was full of it, the glad tidings ran far and wide, disliked by none. Then Italy put off her mourning and the ruined walls of Rome resumed in part their olden splendour; for they believed the full conversion of their fosterchild to be a sign of God's favour towards them. You would fancy that the Goths had been annihilated and that that concourse of deserters and slaves had fallen by a thunderbolt from the Lord on high. There was less elation in Rome when Marcellus won his first success at Nola[fn-51-P5102_1408833:3639-nf] after thousands of Romans had fallen at the Trebia, Lake Thrasymenus, and Cannae. There was less joy among the nobles cooped up in the capitol, on whom the future of Rome depended, when after buying their lives with gold they heard that the Gauls had at length been routed.[fn-51-P5103_1409185:3640-nf] The news penetrated to the coasts of the East, and this triumph of Christian glory was heard of in the remote cities of the interior. What Christian virgin was not proud to have Demetrias as a companion? What mother did not call Juliana's womb blessed? Unbelievers may scoff at the doubtfulness of rewards to come. Meantime, in becoming a virgin you have gained more than you have sacrificed. Had you become a man's bride but one province would have known of you; while as a Christian virgin you are known to the whole world. Mothers who have but little faith in Christ are unhappily wont to dedicate to virginity only deformed and crippled daughters for whom they can find no suitable husbands. Glass beads, as the saying goes, are thought equal to pearls.[fn-51-P5104_1410033:3641-nf] Men who pride themselves on their religion give to their virgin daughters sums scarcely sufficient for their maintenance, and bestow the bulk of their property upon sons and daughters living in the world. Quite recently in this city a rich presbyter left two of his daughters who were professed virgins with a mere pittance, while he provided his other children with ample means for self-indulgence and pleasure. The same thing has been done, I am sorry to say, by many women who have adopted the ascetic life. Would that such instances were rare, but unfortunately they are not. Yet the more frequent they are the more blessed are those who refuse to follow an example which is set them by so many.","index":"1409","references":[{"fn":"51","code":"P5102_1408833","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Over Hannibal, b.c. 216.

I think it unnecessary to warn you against covetousness since it is the way of your family both to have riches and to despise them. The apostle too tells us that covetousness is idolatry,[fn-52-P5217_1434349:3734-nf] and to one who asked the Lord the question: \"Good Master what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?\" He thus replied: \"If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come and follow me.\"[fn-52-P5218_1434641:3735-nf] Such is the climax of complete and apostolic virtue-to sell all that one has and to distribute to the poor,[fn-52-P5219_1434788:3736-nf] and thus freed from all earthly encumbrance to fly up to the heavenly realms with Christ. To us, or I should rather say to you, a careful stewardship is entrusted, although in such matters full freedom of choice is left to every individual, whether old or young. Christ's words are \"if thou wilt be perfect.\" I do not compel you, He seems to say, I do not command you, but I set the palm before you, I shew you the prize; it is for you to choose whether you will enter the arena and win the crown. Let us consider how wisely Wisdom has spoken. \"Sell that thou hast.\" To whom is the command given? Why, to him to whom it was said, \"if thou wilt be perfect.\" Sell not a part of thy goods but \"all that thou hast.\" And when you have sold them, what then? \"Give to the poor.\" Not to the rich, not to your kinsfolk, not to minister to self indulgence; but to relieve need. It does not matter whether a man is a priest or a relation or a connexion, you must think of nothing but his poverty. Let your praises come from the stomachs of the hungry and not from the rich banquets of the overfed. We read in the Acts of the Apostles how, while the blood of the Lord was still warm and believers were in the fervour of their first faith, they all sold their possessions and laid the price of them at the apostles' feet (to shew that money ought to be trampled underfoot) and \"distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.\"[fn-52-P5220_1436260:3737-nf] But Ananias and Sapphira proved timid stewards, and what is more, deceitful ones; therefore they brought on themselves condemnation. For having made a vow they offered their money to God as if it were their own and not His to whom they had vowed it; and keeping back for their own use a part of that which belonged to another, through fear of famine which true faith never fears, they drew down on themselves suddenly the avenging stroke, which was meant not in cruelty towards them but as a warning to others.[fn-52-P5221_1436806:3738-nf] In fact the apostle Peter by no means called down death upon them as Porphyry[fn-52-P5222_1436907:3739-nf] foolishly says. He merely announced God's judgment by the spirit of prophecy, that the doom of two persons might be a lesson to many. From the time of your dedication to perpetual virginity your property is yours no longer; or rather is now first truly yours because it has come to be Christ's. Yet while your grandmother and mother are living you must deal with it according to their wishes. If, however, they die and rest in the sleep of the saints (and I know that they desire that you should survive them); when your years are riper, and your will steadier, and your resolution stronger, you will do with your money what seems best to you, or rather what the Lord shall command, knowing as you will that hereafter you will have nothing save that which you have here spent on good works. Others may build churches, may adorn their walls when built with marbles, may procure massive columns, may deck the unconscious capitals with gold and precious ornaments, may cover church doors with silver and adorn the altars with gold and gems. I do not blame those who do these things; I do not repudiate them.[fn-52-P5223_1438144:3740-nf] Everyone must follow his own judgment. And it is better to spend one's money thus than to hoard it up and brood over it. However your duty is of a different kind. It is yours to clothe Christ in the poor, to visit Him in the sick, to feed Him in the hungry, to shelter Him in the homeless, particularly such as are of the household of faith,[fn-52-P5224_1438517:3741-nf] to support communities of virgins, to take care of God's servants, of those who are poor in spirit, who serve the same Lord as you day and night, who while they are on earth live the angelic life and speak only of the praises of God. Having food and raiment they rejoice and count themselves rich. They seek for nothing more, contented if only they can persevere in their design.

Still even for men there is always the risk that, being withdrawn from the society of their fellows, they may become exposed to unclean and godless imaginations, and in the fulness of their arrogance and disdain may look down upon everyone but themselves, and may arm their tongues to detract from the clergy or from those who like themselves are bound by the vows of a solitary life.[fn-52-P5244_1445623:3756-nf] Of such it is well said by the psalmist, \"as for the children of men their teeth are spears and arrows and their tongue a sharp sword.\"[fn-52-P5245_1445786:3757-nf] Now if all this is true of men, how much more does it apply to women whose fickle and vacillating minds, if left to their own devices, soon degenerate.

It is idle for Him to have given me the power of choice if I cannot use it without His constant help. For will that requires external support ceases to be will. God has given me freedom of choice, but what becomes of this if I cannot do as I wish?\" Accordingly he propounds the following dilemma: \"Either once for all I use the power which is given to me, and so preserve the freedom of my will; or I need the help of another, in which case the freedom of my will is wholly abrogated.\"","index":"1467","references":[{"fn":"53","code":"P5347_1475325","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Viz., \"A man may be without sin.\" See for this and the other statements of Pelagius, Aug. de Gestis Pelagii, esp. c. 2 and 6.

But if a document which I am unwilling to publish is published without my consent and placed in hands from which I would withhold it, then I shall have to resign myself to the will of God. Indeed, had I wished to keep my words permanently undivulged I should never have sent them to any one. For if (though I hope it may not be so) chance or necessity shall prevent any reply being ever given me, my letter of inquiry is still bound sooner or later to come to light. Nor will it be useless to those who read it; for, although they will nor find what they seek, they will learn how much better it is, when one is uninformed, to put questions than to make assertions; and in the meantime those whom they consult[fn-54-P5490_1520746:3903-nf] will work out the points raised by me, laying aside contention and in the interests of learning and charity trying to obtain sound opinions about them. Thus they will either arrive at the solutions they desire, or their faculties will be quickened and they will learn from the investigation that farther inquiry is useless. At present, however, as I have no reason to despair of an answer from my friend I have decided not to publish the letter I have sent him, and I trust, my dear comrade, that this decision may commend itself to you. It should do so, for you have not asked for my letter so much as for the answer to it; and this I would gladly send you if I had it to send. It is true that in your epistle you speak of \"the lucid demonstration of my wisdom which in virtue of my life the Giver of light has bestowed upon me\"; and if by this you mean not the way in which I have stated the problem but a solution which I have obtained of the point in question, I should like to gratify your wish. But I must admit that I have so far failed to discover how the soul can derive its sin from Adam (a truth which it is unlawful to question) and yet not itself be derived from Adam. At present I think it better to sift the matter farther than to dogmatize rashly.","index":"1519","references":[{"fn":"54","code":"P5489_1519668","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"2 Cor. x. 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":10,"verses":[12]}]},{"fn":"54","code":"P5490_1520746","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"At this point the text is obscure.","bible_refs":[]}]},{"text":"4.

On the other hand, if the old men and the unlettered clerics have wickedly departed from the priests' teachings, surely these latter are the persons to correct them and restrain them from controversial excesses. Again when you say that \"you as a new-fledged and inexperienced teacher have been afraid to tamper with the doctrines handed down by great and famous bishops, and that you have been loth to draw men into a better path lest you should cast discredit on the dead,\" do you not imply that in refusing to agree with you the objects of your solicitude are but preferring the tradition of great and famous bishops to the views of a new-fledged and inexperienced teacher?

For you have made it sufficiently plain to me that you disapprove of those who assert that men's souls are derived from that of the protoplast[fn-54-P5493_1523458:3904-nf] and propagated from one generation to another; but as your letter does not inform me, I have no means of knowing on what grounds and from what passages of scripture you have shewn this view to be false. What does commend itself to you is not clear either from your letter to the brothers at Caesarea or from that which you have lately addressed to me. Only I see that you believe and write that \"God has been, is, and will be the maker of men, and that there is nothing either in heaven or on earth which does not owe its existence wholly to Him.\" This is of course a truism which nobody can call in question. But as you affirm that souls are not propagated, you ought to explain out of what God makes them. Is it out of some pre-existing material, or is it out of nothing? For it is impossible that you should hold the opinion of Origen, Priscillian, and other heretics that it is for deeds done in a former life that souls are confined in earthly and mortal bodies. This opinion is, indeed, flatly contradicted by the apostle who says of Jacob and Esau that before they were born they had done neither good nor evil.[fn-54-P5494_1524639:3905-nf] Your view of the matter, then, is known to me though only partially, but of your reasons for supposing it to be true I know nothing. This was why in a former letter I asked you to send me your confession of faith, the one which you were vexed to find that one of your presbyters had signed dishonestly. I now again ask you for this, as well as for any passages of scripture which you have brought to bear on the question. For you say in your letter to the brothers at Caesarea that you \"have resolved to have all definitions of dogma reviewed by lay judges, sitting by general invitation, and investigating all points touching the faith.\" And you continue: \"the divine mercy has made it possible for them to put forward their views in a positive and definite form, which your modest ability has reinforced with a great weight of evidence.\" Now it is this \"great weight of evidence\" which I am so anxious to obtain. For, so far as I can see, your one aim has been to refute your opponents when they deny that our souls are the handiwork of God. If they hold such a view, you are right in thinking that it should be condemned. Were they to say the same thing of our bodies, they would be forced to retract it, or else be held up to execration. For what Christian can deny that every single human body is the work of God? Yet when we admit that they are of divine origin we do not mean to deny that they are humanly engendered. When therefore it is asserted that our souls are procreated from a kind of immaterial seed, and that they, like our bodies, come to us from our parents, yet are made souls by the working of God, it is not by human guesses that the assertion is to be refuted, but by the witness of divine scripture. Numbers of passages may indeed be quoted from the sacred books which have canonical authority, to prove that our souls are God's handiwork. But such passages only refute those who deny that each several human soul is made by God; not at all those who while they admit this contend that, like our bodies, they are formed by divine agency through the instrumentality of parents. To refute these you must look for unmistakable texts; or, if you have already discovered such, shew your affection by communicating them to me.

For this is true of every creature; and as such is to be believed, asserted, defended, and proved. God has been, is, and will be the author and maker of all things and all men as you have told your fellow-bishops of the province of Caesarea, exhorting them to adopt the doctrine by the example of your brothers and fellow-priests. But there are two quite distinct dilemmas: (1) Is God the author and maker of all souls and bodies (the true view), or is there something in nature which He has not made (a view which is wholly erroneous)? If souls are undoubtedly God's handiwork, does He make them directly, or indirectly by propagation? It is in dealing with this second dilemma that I would have you to be sober and vigilant. Else in refuting the propagation-theory you may fall incautiously into the heresy of Pelagius. Everybody knows that human bodies are propagated by generation; yet if we are right in saying that all human souls-and not only those of Adam and Eve-are created by God, it is clear that to assert their transmission by generation is not to deny their divine origin. For in this view God makes the soul as He makes the body, indirectly by a process of generation. If the truth condemns this as an error, some fresh argument must be sought to confute it. No persons could better advise you on the point (if only they were within reach) than those dead worthies whom you feared to discredit by drawing men away from them into a better path. They were, you said, great and famous bishops while you were a new-fledged and inexperienced teacher; thus you were loth to tamper with their doctrines. Would that I could know on what passages these great men rested their opinion that souls are transmitted! For in your letter to the brothers at Caesarea, you speak of their view with a total disregard of their authority, as a new invention, an unheard-of doctrine; though we all know that, error as it may be, it is no novelty but old and of ancient date.","index":"1525","references":[]},{"text":"8. Now when we have reason to be doubtful about a point, we need not doubt that we are right in doubting. There is no doubt but that we ought to doubt things that are doubtful. For instance, the Apostle has no doubt about doubting whether he was in the body or out of the body when he was carried up into the third heaven.[fn-55-P5501_1532243:3907-nf] Whether it was thus or thus, he says, I know not; God knows. Why may not I, then, so long as I have no light, doubt whether my soul comes to me by generation or unengendered? Why may I not be doubtful about this, so long as I do not doubt that in either case it is the work of God most high? Why may I not say; \"I know that my soul owes its existence to God and is altogether His handiwork; but whether it comes by generation, as the body does, or unengendered, as was Adam's soul, I know not; God knows.\" You wish me to assert positively one view or the other. I might do so if I knew which was right. You may have some light on the point, and if so you will find me keener to learn what I know not than to teach what I know. But if, like myself, you are in the dark, you should pray, as I do, that either through one of His servants, or with His own lips, He would teach us who said to His disciples: \"Be not ye called masters; for one is your master, even Christ.\"[fn-55-P5502_1533235:3908-nf] Yet such knowledge is only expedient for us when He knows it to be expedient who knows both what He has to teach and what we ought to learn.

Still much as I desire to know this after which you seek, I would sooner know when the desire of all nations shall come and when the kingdom of the saints will be set up, than how my soul has come to its earthly abode.

Through Him I know that it is not ours to know the times which God has placed in His own power; but concerning the origin of souls, I am ignorant whether it is or is not ours to know. If I could be sure that such knowledge is not for us, I should cease not only to dogmatize, but even to inquire. As it is, though the subject is so deep and dark that my fear of becoming a rash teacher is almost greater than my eagerness to learn the truth, I still wish to know it if I can do so. It may be that the knowledge for which the psalmist prays: \"Lord, make me to know mine end,\"[fn-55-P5504_1534574:3910-nf] is much more necessary; yet I would that my beginning also might be revealed to me.","index":"1526","references":[{"fn":"55","code":"P5501_1532243","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"2 Cor. xii. 4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"2 corinthians","chapter":12,"verses":[4]}]},{"fn":"55","code":"P5502_1533235","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Matt. xxiii. 10.","bible_refs":[{"book":"matthew","chapter":23,"verses":[10]}]},{"fn":"55","code":"P5503_1533885","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Acts i. 7.","bible_refs":[{"book":"the acts","chapter":1,"verses":[7]}]},{"fn":"55","code":"P5504_1534574","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Ps. xxxix. 4.","bible_refs":[{"book":"psalms","chapter":39,"verses":[4]}]}]},{"text":"9.

For a bishop must be blameless as the steward of God.\"[fn-55-P5540_1544227:3932-nf] And to Timothy he says: \"Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.\"[fn-55-P5541_1544398:3933-nf] Peter also says in his first epistle: \"The presbyters which are among you I exhort, who am your fellow-presbyter and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: feed the flock of Christ[fn-55-P5542_1544657:3934-nf] ...taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly, according unto God.\"[fn-55-P5543_1544766:3935-nf] In the Greek the meaning is still plainer, for the word used is episkopountej, that is to say, overseeing, and this is the origin of the name overseer or bishop.[fn-55-P5544_1544988:3936-nf] But perhaps the testimony of these great men seems to you insufficient. If so, then listen to the blast of the gospel trumpet, that son of thunder,[fn-55-P5545_1545156:3937-nf] the disciple whom Jesus loved[fn-55-P5546_1545209:3938-nf] and who reclining on the Saviour's breast drank in the waters of sound doctrine. One of his letters begins thus: \"The presbyter unto the elect lady and her children whom I love in the truth;\"[fn-55-P5547_1545425:3939-nf] and another thus: \"The presbyter unto the well-beloved Gains whom I love in the truth.\"[fn-55-P5548_1545532:3940-nf] When subsequently one presbyter was chosen to preside over the rest, this was done to remedy schism and to prevent each individual from rending the church of Christ by drawing it to himself. For even at Alexandria from the time of Mark the Evangelist until the episcopates of Heraclas and Dionysius the presbyters always named as bishop one of their own number chosen by themselves and set in a more exalted position, just as an army elects a general, or as deacons appoint one of themselves whom they know to be diligent and call him archdeacon. For what function, excepting ordination, belongs to a bishop that does not also belong to a presbyter? It is not the case that there is one church at Rome and another in all the world beside. Gaul and Britain, Africa and Persia, India and the East worship one Christ and observe one rule of truth. If you ask for authority, the world outweighs its capital.[fn-55-P5549_1546456:3941-nf] Wherever there is a bishop, whether it be at Rome or at Engubium, whether it be at Constantinople or at Rhegium, whether it be at Alexandria or at Zoan, his dignity is one and his priesthood is one. Neither the command of wealth nor the lowliness of poverty makes him more a bishop or less a bishop. All alike are successors of the apostles.[fn-55-P5550_1546829:3942-nf] ","index":"1538","references":[{"fn":"55","code":"P5533_1542598","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Isa. xxxii. 6, RV.","bible_refs":[{"book":"isaiah","chapter":32,"verses":[6]}]},{"fn":"55","code":"P5534_1542858","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Acts vi. 1, Acts vi. 2.","bible_refs":[{"book":"the acts","chapter":6,"verses":[1]},{"book":"the acts","chapter":6,"verses":[2]}]},{"fn":"55","code":"P5535_1543004","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Ad quorum preces Christi corpus sanguisque conficitur.

Either then a presbyter should be ordained a deacon, from the lesser office, that is, to the more important, to prove that a presbyter is inferior to a deacon; or if on the other hand it is the deacon that is ordained presbyter, this latter should recognize that, although he may be less highly paid than a deacon, he is superior to him in virtue of his priesthood.

Yet doom overtook him when he pursued through the wilderness the people whom he had previously let go and presumed to enter the very sea in the eagerness of his pursuit. For only in this one way could he learn the lesson that He is to be dreaded whom even the elements obey. He had said: \"I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go;\"[fn-55-P5567_1551972:3953-nf] and you imitate him when you say: \"The vision that he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of the times that are far off.\"[fn-55-P5568_1552128:3954-nf] Yet the same prophet confutes you with these words: \"Thus saith the Lord God, There shall none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have spoken shall be done.\" David too says of the godless (and of godlessness you have proved yourself not a slight but an eminent example), that in this world they rejoice in good fortune and say: \"How doth God know?

It is still more wicked to carry them out; yet in My mercy and kindness I have permitted even this. But should the sinful thought have become the sinful deed? Should men in their pride have trampled thus on my tenderness? Nevertheless \"I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live;\"[fn-55-P5582_1556979:3966-nf] and as it is not they that are whole who need a physician but they that are sick,[fn-55-P5583_1557088:3967-nf] even after his sin I hold out a hand to the prostrate sinner and exhort him, polluted as he is in his own blood,[fn-55-P5584_1557222:3968-nf] to wash away his stains with tears of penitence. But if even then he shews himself unwilling to repent, and if, after he has suffered shipwreck, he refuses to clutch the plank which alone can save him, I am compelled at last to say: \"Thus saith the Lord, For three transgressions and for four shall I not turn away from him?\" For this \"turning away\" God accounts a punishment, inasmuch as the sinner is left to his own devices. It is thus that he visits the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation;[fn-55-P5585_1557783:3969-nf] not punishing those who sin immediately but pardoning their first offences and only passing sentence on them for their last. For if it were otherwise and if God were to stand forth on the moment as the avenger of iniquity, the church would lose many of its saints; and certainly would be deprived of the apostle Paul. The prophet Ezekiel, from whom we have quoted above, repeating God's words spoken to himself speaks thus: \"Open thy mouth and eat what I shall give thee. And behold,\" he says, \"an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein; and he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and a song, and woe.\"[fn-55-P5586_1558496:3970-nf] The first of these three belongs to you if you prove willing, as a sinner, to repent of your sins. The second belongs to those who are holy, who are called upon to sing praises to God; for praise does not become a sinner's mouth. And the third belongs to persons like you who in despair have given themselves over to uncleanness, to fornication, to the belly, and to the lowest lusts; men who suppose that death ends all and that there is nothing beyond it; who say: \"When the overflowing scourge shall pass through it shall not come unto us.\"[fn-55-P5587_1559086:3971-nf] The book which the prophet eats is the whole series of the Scriptures, which in turn bewail the penitent, celebrate the righteous, and curse the desperate. For nothing is so displeasing to God as an impenitent heart. Impenitence is the one sin for which there is no forgiveness. For if one who ceases to sin is pardoned even after he has sinned, and if prayer has power to bend the judge; it follows that every impenitent sinner must provoke his judge to wrath. Thus despair is the one sin for which there is no remedy. By obstinate rejection of God's grace men turn His mercy into sternness and severity. Yet, that you may know that God does every day call sinners to repentance, hear Isaiah's Words: \"In that day,\" he says, \"did the Lord God of Hosts call to weeping and to mourning and to baldness and to girding with sackcloth: and behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine; let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we shall die.\" After these words filled with the recklessness of despair the Scripture goes on to say: \"And it was revealed in my ears by the Lord of Hosts, Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die.\"[fn-55-P5588_1560295:3972-nf] Only when they become dead to sin, will their sin be forgiven them.

The angels cry aloud, the shepherds run, the star shines down from heaven, the wise men worship, Herod is terrified, Jerusalem is in confusion, and meantime you creep into a virgin's cell to seduce the virgin to whom it belongs. I am filled with consternation and a shiver runs through me, soul and body, when I try to set before your eyes the deed that you have done. The whole church was keeping vigil by night and proclaiming Christ as its Lord;? one spirit though in different tongues the praises of God were being sung. Yet you were squeezing your love-notes into the openings of what is now the altar, as it was once the manger, of the Lord, choosing this place in order that your unhappy victim might find and read them when she came to kneel and worship there.

Let us see then, my good friend, how you acted in these surroundings.

She had assumed the bridal-veil of Christ in the basilica of the apostle Peter and had vowed to live henceforth in the monastery, in the spots consecrated by the Lord's Cross, His Resurrection, and His Ascension; and yet after all this you dared to accept that hair, which at Christ's command she had cut off in the cave of His birth, as a token of her readiness to sleep with you. Again you used to sit beneath her window from the evening till the morning; and because owing to its height you could not come to close quarters with her, you conveyed things to her and she in her turn to you by the aid of a cord.
