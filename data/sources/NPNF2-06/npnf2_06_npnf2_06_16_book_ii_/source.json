It is rather an argument from Scripture to prove the point of the Augustinian arguer, Atticus. From the fourth chapter onwards it consists, like the last five chapters of Book I., of a chain of Scripture texts, taken from the New Testament and the Prophets, to show the universality of sin, and thus to refute the Pelagian assertion that a man can be without sin if he wills. We shall, therefore, give, as in the previous case, a list of the texts and the first words of them, only giving Jerome's words where he introduces some original remark of his own, or some noteworthy comment.","index":"2","references":[]},{"text":"The Pelagian begins by reiterating the dilemma: If the commandments are given to be obeyed, then man can be without sin; if he is, by his creation, such that he must be a sinner, then God, not he, is the author of sin. To the argument that sacrifices are enjoined for sins of ignorance, he replies by appealing from the Old Testament to the New, which leads to a discussion (2, 3) on St. Paul's description of the conflict with sin, in Romans vii. Paul, it is argued, speaks not as a sinner, but as a man, and thus confesses the sinfulness of humanity. That men may be without ingrained vice is possible; that they can be without sin is not. This leads the Augustinian, Atticus, resuming his list of testimonies, to the fact that, though men are found who are righteous as avoiding wickedness (kaki/a), yet none is without sin (a0nama/rthtoj).","index":"3","references":[]},{"text":"In Psalm xxxii. 5.

There are four emotions which agitate mankind, two relating to the present, two to the future; two to good, and two to evil. There is sorrow, called in Greek lu/ph, and joy, in Greek xara/ or h9donh/, although many translate the latter word by voluptas, pleasure; the one of which is referred to evil, the other to good. And we go too far if we rejoice over such things as we ought not, as, for example, riches, power, distinctions, the bad fortune of enemies, or their death; or, on the other hand, if we are tortured with grief on account of present evils, adversity, exile, poverty, weakness, and the death of kindred, all of which is forbidden by the Apostle. And again, if we covet those things which we consider good, inheritance, distinctions, unvaried prosperity, bodily health, and the like, in the possession of which we rejoice and find enjoyment; or if we fear those things which we deem adverse. Now, according to the Stoics, Zeno that is to say and Chrysippus, it is possible for a perfect man to be free from these emotions; according to the Peripatetics, it is difficult and even impossible, an opinion which has the constant support of all Scripture. Hence Josephus, the historian of the Maccabees, said that the emotions can be subdued and governed, not extirpated, and Cicero's five books of \"Tusculan Disputations\" are full of these discussions.[fn-75-P7534_2487868:2-nf] Accordto the Apostle, the weakness of the body and spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places fight against us. And the same writer[fn-75-P7535_2488026:3-nf] tells us that the works of the flesh and the works of the spirit are manifest, and these are contrary the one to the other, so that we do not the things that we would. If we do not what we would, but what we would not, how can you say that a man can be without sin if he chooses? You see that neither an Apostle, nor any believer can perform what he wishes.[fn-75-P7536_2488398:4-nf] \"Love covereth a multitude of sins,\" not so much sins of the past as sins of the present, that we may not sin any more while the love of God abideth in us. Wherefore it is said concerning the woman that was a sinner,[fn-75-P7537_2488632:5-nf] \"Her sins which are many are forgiven her, for she loved much.\" And this shows us that the doing what we wish does not depend merely upon our own power, but upon the assistance which God in His mercy gives to our will.","index":"36","references":[{"fn":"75","code":"P7534_2487868","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Eph. vi. 12.","bible_refs":[{"book":"ephesians","chapter":6,"verses":[12]}]},{"fn":"75","code":"P7535_2488026","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Gal. v. 19","bible_refs":[{"book":"galatians","chapter":5,"verses":[19]}]},{"fn":"75","code":"P7536_2488398","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1 Pet. iv. 8.","bible_refs":[{"book":"1 peter","chapter":4,"verses":[8]}]},{"fn":"75","code":"P7537_2488632","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Luke vii. 47.","bible_refs":[{"book":"luke","chapter":7,"verses":[47]}]}]},{"text":"7.

The Apostle does what he would not, and what he would he does not; but I do what I will, and what I would not I do not: the kingdom of heaven has been prepared for me, or rather I have by my virtuous life prepared it for myself. Adam was subject to punishment, and so are others who think themselves guilty after the similitude of Adam's transgressions; I and my crew alone have nothing to fear. Other men shut up in their cells and who never see women, because, poor creatures! they do not listen to my words, are tormented with desire: crowds of women may surround me, I feel no stirring of concupiscence. For to me may be applied the[fn-76-P7697_2499418:9-nf] words, `Holy stones are rolled upon the ground,' and the reason why I am insensible to the attraction of sin is that in the power of free will I carry Christ's trophy about with me.\" But let us listen to God[fn-76-P7698_2499768:10-nf] proclaiming by the mouth of Isaiah: \"O my people, they which call thee happy cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.\" Who is the greatest subverter of the people of God-he who, relying on the power of free choice, despises the help of the Creator, and is satisfied with following his own will, or he who dreads to be judged by the details of the Lord's commandments? To men of this sort, God[fn-76-P7699_2500191:11-nf] says, \"Woe unto you that are wise in your own eyes, and prudent in your own sight.\" Isaiah, if we follow the Hebrew, laments[fn-77-P7700_2500328:12-nf] and says, \"Woe is me because I have been silent, because I am a man of unclean lips: and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips, for mine eyes have seen the Lord of Hosts.\" He for his meritorious and virtuous life enjoyed the sight of God, and conscious of his sins confessed that he had unclean lips. Not that he had said anything repugnant to the will of God, but because, either from fear, or from a deep sense of shame, he had been[fn-77-P7701_2500786:13-nf] silent, and had not reproved the errors of the people so freely as a prophet should. When do we sinners rebuke offenders, we who flatter wealth and accept the persons of sinners for the sake of filthy lucre? for we shall hardly say that we speak with perfect frankness to men of whose assistance we stand in need. Suppose that we do not such things as they, suppose we keep ourselves from every form of sin; to refrain from speaking the truth is certainly sin. In the Septuagint, however, we do not find the words \"because I have been silent,\" but \"because I was pricked,\" that is with the consciousness of sin; and thus the words of the[fn-77-P7702_2501545:14-nf] prophet are fulfilled. \"My life was turned into misery while I was pierced by the thorn.\" He was pricked by the thorn of sin: you are decked with the flowers of virtue.[fn-77-P7703_2501733:15-nf] \"The moon shall be ashamed, and the sun confounded, when the Lord shall punish the host of heaven on high.\" This is explained by another passage.[fn-77-P7704_2501898:16-nf] \"Even the stars are unclean in His sight,\" and again,[fn-77-P7705_2501969:17-nf] \"He chargeth His angels with folly.\" The moon is ashamed, the sun is confounded, and the sky covered with sackcloth, and shall we fearlessly and joyously, as though we were free from all sin, face the majesty of the Judge, when the mountains shall melt away, that is, all who are lifted up by pride, and all the host of the heavens, whether they be stars, or angelic powers, when the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll, and all their host shall fade away like leaves?","index":"192","references":[{"fn":"76","code":"P7697_2499418","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Zech. ix. 16, Sept.
