Preaching from Psalm xix., he allegorically expounded the \"heavens\" to represent the martyrs and apostles, and the \"day\" he takes to be their confession. They were humbled by God, and then raised again. He then gives an account of the state in which their bodies were found, and of their translation to the basilica. In another address he speaks of the joy of the Catholics and the malice of the Arians who denied the miracles that were being wrought, as the Jews used to do, and points out that their faith is quite different from that of the martyrs, and that since the devils acknowledge the Trinity, and they do not, they are worse than the very devils themselves.","index":"2","references":[]},{"text":"To the lady, his sister, dearer to him than his eyes and life, Ambrose Bishop.","index":"3","references":[]},{"text":"1.
