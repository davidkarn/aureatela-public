Howbeit, to make it more abundantly clear and known that the standing implied no dishonour, but rather sovereignty, Stephen prayed to the Son, being desirous to commend himself the more to the Father, saying: \"Lord Jesu, receive my spirit.\"[fn-51-P5167_1323549:232-nf] Again, to show that the sovereignty of the Father and of the Son is one and the same, he prayed again, saying, \"Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.\"[fn-51-P5168_1323723:233-nf] These are the words that the Lord, in His own Passion, speaks to the Father, as the Son of Man-these the words of Stephen's prayer, in his own martyrdom to the Son of God.

We indeed are unmoved by their arguments; howbeit, let them, to whom the letter and sequence is all important, take notice that the first petition is addressed to the Son. Now we, even on their understanding of the passage, prove from it the unity of the Father's and the Son's majesty; for when the Son is addressed in prayer as well as the Father, the equality which the prayer assigns points to unity in action.
