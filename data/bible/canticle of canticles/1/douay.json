{"verses":["Let him kiss me with the kiss of his mouth:  for thy breasts are\nbetter than wine,","Smelling sweet of the best ointments.  Thy name is as oil poured\nout:  therefore young maidens have loved thee.","Draw me:  we will run after thee to the odour of thy ointments.  The\nking hath brought me into his storerooms:  we will be glad and rejoice\nin thee, remembering thy breasts more than wine:  the rightous love\nthee.","I am black but beautiful, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the\ntents of Cedar, as the curtains of Solomon.","Do not consider me that I am brown, because the sun hath altered\nmy colour:  the sons of my mother have fought against me, they have made\nme the keeper in the vineyards:  my vineyard I have not kept.","Shew me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where\nthou liest in the midday, lest I begin to wander after the flocks of\nthy companions.","If thou know not thyself, O fairest among women, go forth, and\nfollow after the steps of the flocks, and feed thy kids beside the\ntents of the shepherds.","To my company of horsemen, in Pharao's chariots, have I likened\nthee, O my love.","Thy cheeks are beautiful as the turtledove's, thy neck as jewels.","We will make thee chains of gold, inlaid with silver.","While the king was at his repose, my spikenard sent forth the\nodour thereof.","A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me, he shall abide between my\nbreasts.","A cluster of cypress my love is to me, in the vineyards of\nEngaddi.","Behold thou are fair, O my love, behold thou are fair, thy eyes\nare as those of doves.","Behold thou art fair, my beloved, and comely.  Our bed is\nflourishing.","The beams of our houses are of cedar, our rafters of cypress\ntrees."]}
