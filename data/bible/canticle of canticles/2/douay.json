{"verses":["I am the flower of the field, and the lily of the valleys.","As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.","As the apple tree among the trees of the woods, so is my beloved\namong the sons.  I sat down under his shadow, whom I desired:  and his\nfruit was sweet to my palate.","He brought me into the cellar of wine, he set in order charity in\nme.","Stay me up with flowers, compass me about with apples:  because I\nlanguish with love.","His left hand is under my head, and his right hand shall embrace\nme.","I adjure you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and the\nharts of the field, that you stir not up, nor make the beloved to\nawake, till she please.","The voice of my beloved, behold he cometh leaping upon the\nmountains, skipping over the hills.","My beloved is like a roe, or a young hart.  Behold he standeth\nbehind our wall, looking through the windows, looking through the\nlattices.","Behold my beloved speaketh to me:  Arise, make haste, my love, my\ndove, my beautiful one, and come.","For winter is now past, the rain is over and gone.","The flowers have appeared in our land, the time of pruning is\ncome:  the voice of the turtle is heard in our land:","The fig tree hath put forth her green figs:  the vines in flower\nyield their sweet smell.  Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come:","My dove in the clefts of the rock, in the hollow places of the\nwall, shew me thy face, let thy voice sound in my ears:  for thy voice\nis sweet, and thy face comely.","Catch us the little foxes that destroy the vines:  for our\nvineyard hath flourished.","My beloved to me, and I to him who feedeth among the lilies,","Till the day break, and the shadows retire.  Return:  be like, my\nbeloved, to a roe, or to a young hart upon the mountains of Bether."]}
