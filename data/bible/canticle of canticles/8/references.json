And in another place, \"He that committeth sin is of the devil.\"[fn-5-P594_112687:338-nf] Born, in the first instance, of such parentage we are naturally black, and even when we have repented, so long as we have not scaled the heights of virtue, we may still say: \"I am black but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem.\"[fn-5-P595_112937:339-nf] But you will say to me, \"I have left the home of my childhood; I have forgotten my father, I am born anew in Christ.

Who hath heard, who hath seen any such thing ever come to pass?\"-or lest you should suspect the disciple as inventing these things to favor his Master;-he introduces Joseph as contributing, by what he underwent, to the proof of the things mentioned; and by his narrative all but says, \"If thou doubt, me, and if thou suspect my testimony, believe her husband.\" For \"Joseph,\" saith he, \"her husband, being a just man.\" By \"a just man\" in this place he means him that is virtuous in all things. For both freedom from covetousness is justice, and universal virtue is also justice;[fn-5-P505_123206:24-nf] and it is mostly in this latter sense that the Scripture uses the name of justice; as when it saith, \"a man that was just and true;\"[fn-5-P506_123378:25-nf] and again, \"they were both just.\"[fn-5-P507_123429:26-nf] Being then \"just,\" that is good and considerate, \"he was minded to put her away privily.\" For this intent he tells what took place before Joseph's being fully informed, that thou mightest not mistrust what was done after he knew. However, such a one was not liable to be made a public example only, but that she should also be punished was the command of the law. Whereas Joseph remitted not only that greater punishment, but the less likewise, namely, the disgrace. For so far from punishing, he was not minded even to make an example of her. Seest thou a man under self-restraint, and freed from the most tyrannical of passions. For ye know how great a thing jealousy is: and therefore He said, to whom these things are clearly known, \"For full of jealousy is the rage of a husband;\"[fn-5-P508_124232:27-nf] \"he will not spare in the day of vengeance:\" and \"jealousy is cruel as the grave.\"[fn-5-P509_124334:28-nf] And we too know of many that have chosen to give up their lives rather than fall under the suspicion of jealousy. But in this case it was not so little as suspicion, the burden of the womb entirely convicting her. But nevertheless he was so free from passion as to be unwilling to grieve the Virgin even in the least matters. Thus, whereas to keep her in his house seemed like a transgression of the law, but to expose and bring her to trial would constrain him to deliver her to die; he doth none of these things, but conducts himself now by a higher rule than the law. For grace being come, there must needs henceforth be many tokens of that exalted citizenship. For as the sun, though as yet he show not his beams, doth from afar by his light illumine more than half[fn-5-P510_125125:29-nf] the world; so likewise Christ, when about to rise from that womb, even before He came forth, shone over all the world. Wherefore, even before her travail, prophets danced for joy, and women foretold what was to come, and John, when he had not yet come forth from the belly, leaped from the very womb. Hence also this man exhibited great self-command, in that he neither accused nor upbraided, but only set about putting her away.","title":"Homily IV.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":8,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_08_lecture_iii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"16.

I pass to the Song of Songs, and whereas our opponent thinks it makes altogether for marriage, I shall show that it contains the mysteries of virginity. Let us hear what the bride says before that the bridegroom comes to earth, suffers, descends to the lower world, and rises again.[fn-63-P6358_1955785:195-nf] \"We will make for thee likenesses of gold with ornaments of silver while the king sits at his table.\" Before the Lord rose again, and the Gospel shone, the bride had not gold, but likenesses of gold. As for the silver, however, which she professes to have at the marriage, she not only had silver ornaments, but she had them in variety-in widows, in the continent, and in the married. Then the bridegroom makes answer to the bride, and teaches her that the shadow of the old law has passed away, and the truth of the Gospel has come.[fn-63-P6359_1956395:196-nf] \"Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away, for lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.\" This relates to the Old Testament. Once more he speaks of the Gospel and of virginity: \"The flowers appear on the earth, the time of the pruning of vines has come.\" Does he not seem to you to say the very same thing that the Apostle says:[fn-63-P6360_1956774:197-nf] \"The time is shortened that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none\"? And more plainly does he herald chastity:[fn-63-P6361_1956938:198-nf] \"The voice,\" he says, \"of the turtle is heard in our land.\" The turtle, the chastest of birds, always dwelling in lofty places, is a type of the Saviour. Let us read the works of naturalists and we shall find that it is the nature of the turtle-dove, if it lose its mate, not to take another; and we shall understand that second marriage is repudiated even by dumb birds. And immediately the turtle says to its fellow:[fn-63-P6362_1957378:199-nf] \"The fig tree hath put forth its green figs,\" that is, the commandments of the old law have fallen, and the blossoming vines of the Gospel give forth their fragrance Whence the Apostle also says,[fn-63-P6363_1957592:200-nf] \"We are a sweet savour of Christ.\"[fn-63-P6364_1957649:201-nf] \"Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. O my dove, thou art in the clefts of the rock, in the covert of the steep place. Let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.\"[fn-63-P6365_1957917:202-nf] Whilst thou coveredst thy countenance like Moses and the veil of the law remained, I neither saw thy face, nor did I condescend to hear thy voice. I said,[fn-63-P6366_1958127:203-nf] \"Yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear.\" But now with unveiled face behold my glory, and shelter thyself in the cleft and steep places of the solid rock. On hearing this the bride disclosed the mysteries of chastity:[fn-63-P6367_1958372:204-nf] \"My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth his flock among the lilies,\" that is among the pure virgin bands. Would you know what sort of a throne our true Solomon, the Prince of Peace, has, and what his attendants are like?[fn-63-P6368_1958620:205-nf] \"Behold,\" he says, \"it is the litter of Solomon: threescore mighty men are about it, of the mighty men of Israel. They all handle the sword, and are expert in war: every man hath his sword upon his thigh.\" They who are about Solomon have their sword upon their thigh, like Ehud, the left-handed judge, who slew the fattest of foes, a man devoted to the flesh, and cut short all his pleasures.[fn-63-P6369_1959048:206-nf] \"I will get me,\" he says, \"to the mountain of myrrh;\" to those, that is, who have mortified their bodies; \"and to the hill of frankincense,\" to the crowds of pure virgins; \"and I will say to my bride, thou art all fair, my love, and there is no spot in thee.\" Whence too the Apostle:[fn-63-P6370_1959352:207-nf] \"That he might present the church to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing.\"[fn-63-P6371_1959483:208-nf] \"Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, with me from Lebanon. Thou shalt come[fn-63-P6372_1959579:209-nf] and pass on from the beginning of faith, from the top of Sanir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.\" Lebanon is, being interpreted, whiteness. Come then, fairest bride, concerning whom it is elsewhere said[fn-63-P6373_1959866:210-nf] \"Who is she that cometh up, all in white?\" and pass on by way of this world, from the beginning of faith, and from Sanir, which is by interpretation, God of light, as we read in the psalm:[fn-63-P6374_1960077:211-nf] \"Thy word is a lantern unto my feet, and light unto my path;\" and \"from Hermon,\" that is, consecration: and \"flee from the lions' dens, and the mountains of the leopards who cannot change their spots.\" Flee, he says, from the lions' dens, flee from the pride of devils, that when thou hast been consecrated to me, I may be able to say unto thee:[fn-63-P6375_1960445:212-nf] \"Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my bride, thou hast ravished mine heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.\" What he says is something like this-I do not reject marriage: you have a second eye, the left, which I have given to you on account of the weakness of those who cannot see the right. But I am pleased with the right eye of virginity, and if it be blinded the whole body is in darkness. And that we might not think he had in view carnal love and bodily marriage, he at once excludes this meaning by saying[fn-63-P6376_1961003:213-nf] \"Thou hast ravished my heart, my bride, my sister.\" The name sister excludes all suspicion of unhallowed love. \"How fair are thy breasts with wine,\" those breasts concerning which he had said above, My beloved is mine, and I am his: \"betwixt my breasts shall he lie,\" that is in the princely portion of the heart where the Word of God has its lodging. What wine is that which gives beauty to the breasts of the bride, and fills them with the milk of chastity? That, forsooth, of which the bridegroom goes on to speak:[fn-63-P6377_1961555:214-nf] \"I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends: yea, drink and be drunken, my brethren.\" Hence the Apostles also were said to be filled with new wine; with new, he says, not with old wine; because[fn-63-P6378_1961775:215-nf] new wine is put into fresh wine-skins, and they[fn-63-P6379_1961847:216-nf] did not walk in oldness of the letter, but in newness of the Spirit. This is wine wherewith when youths and maidens are intoxicated, they at once thirst for virginity; they are filled with the spirit of chastity, and the prophecy of Zechariah comes to pass, at least if we follow the Hebrew literally, for he prophesied concerning virgins:[fn-63-P6380_1962207:217-nf] \"And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof. For what is his goodness, and what is his beauty, but the corn of the elect, and wine that giveth birth to virgins?\" They are virgins of whom it is written in the forty-fifth psalm:[fn-63-P6381_1962646:218-nf] \"The virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee. With gladness and rejoicing shall they be led: they shall enter into the King's palace.\" 31. Then follows:[fn-63-P6382_1962857:219-nf] \"A garden shut up is my sister, my bride: a garden shut up, a fountain sealed.\" That which is shut up and sealed reminds us of the mother of our Lord who was a mother and a Virgin. Hence it was that no one before or after our Saviour was laid in his new tomb, hewn in the solid rock. And yet she that was ever a Virgin is the mother of many virgins. For next we read: \"Thy shoots are an orchard of pomegranates with precious fruits.\" By pomegranates and fruits is signified the blending of all virtues in virginity.[fn-63-P6383_1963409:220-nf] \"My beloved is white and ruddy\"; white in virginity, ruddy in martyrdom. And because He is white and ruddy, therefore it is immediately added[fn-63-P6384_1963571:221-nf] \"His mouth is most sweet, yea, he is altogether lovely.\" The virgin bridegroom having been praised by the virgin bride, in turn praises the virgin bride, and says to her:[fn-63-P6385_1963762:222-nf] \"How beautiful are thy feet in sandals,[fn-63-P6386_1963823:223-nf] O daughter of Aminadab,\" which is, being interpreted, a people that offereth itself willingly. For virginity is voluntary, and therefore the steps of the Church in the beauty of chastity are praised. This is not the time for me like a commentator to explain all the mysteries of virginity from the Song of Songs I have no doubt that the fastidious reader will turn up his nose at what has already been said.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":8,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_13_to_pammachius_against_john_of_jerusalem","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"41","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"34.

In few words he shows the whole mystery of the resurrection, that is, both the reality of the flesh and the growth in glory. And the meaning is: Who is he that cometh up from the earth, cometh up from blood? According to the[fn-71-P7131_2353827:97-nf] prophecy of Jacob, He has bound His foal to the vine, and has trodden the wine-press alone, and His garments are red with new wine from Bosor, that is from flesh, or from the tribulation of the world: for He Himself[fn-71-P7132_2354063:98-nf] has conquered the world. And, therefore, His garments are red and shining, because He is[fn-71-P7133_2354171:99-nf] beauteous in form more than the sons of men, and on account of the glory of His triumph they have been changed into a white robe; and then, in truth, as concerns Christ's flesh, were fulfilled the words,[fn-71-P7134_2354395:100-nf] \"Who is this that cometh up all in white, leaning upon her beloved?\" And that which is written in the same book:[fn-71-P7135_2354530:101-nf] \"My beloved is white and ruddy.\" These men are his true followers who have not[fn-71-P7136_2354629:102-nf] defiled their garments with women, for they have continued virgins, who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. And so they shall be in white clothing. Then shall the saying of our Lord appear perfectly realised:[fn-71-P7137_2354887:103-nf] \"All that my Father has given me, I shall not lose aught thereof, but I will raise it up again at the last day;\" the whole of His humanity, forsooth, which He had taken upon Him in its entirety at His birth. Then shall the sheep which was[fn-71-P7138_2355146:104-nf] lost, and was wandering in the lower world, be carried whole on the Saviour's shoulders, and the sheep which was sick with sin shall be supported by the mercy of the Judge. Then shall they see him who pierced Him, who shouted,[fn-71-P7139_2355395:105-nf] \"Crucify Him, crucify Him.\" Again and again shall they beat their breasts, they and their women, those women to whom our Lord said, as He carried His cross,[fn-71-P7140_2355572:106-nf] \"Ye daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me but weep for yourselves, and for your children.\" Then shall be fulfilled the prophecy of the angels, who said to the stupefied Apostles,[fn-71-P7141_2355776:107-nf] \"Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye looking with astonishment into heaven? This Jesus who is taken from you into heaven, shall come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven.\" But what are we to think of a man saying that our Lord[fn-71-P7142_2356031:108-nf] ate with the Apostles for forty days after His resurrection in order that they might not think Him to be a phantom, and then asserting that it was a phantom which did this very thing, which ate and which was seen by many in the flesh. That which was seen is either real, or false. If it is real, it follows that He really ate, and really had members. But if it is false, how could He be willing to give false impressions in order to prove the truth of His resurrection? For no one proves what is true by means of what is false. You will say, are we then going to eat after our resurrection? I know not. Scripture does not tell us; and yet, if the question be asked, I do not think we shall eat. For I have read that the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, while it promises[fn-71-P7143_2356821:109-nf] such things as eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man. Moses fasted forty days and forty nights. Human nature does not allow of this, but what is impossible with men is not impossible with God. Just as, in foretelling the future, it matters not whether a person announces what will take place after ten years or after a hundred, since the knowledge of futurity is all one; so he who can fast for forty days and yet live,-not, indeed, that he can of himself fast, but that he lives by the power of God,-will also be able to live for ever without food and drink. Why did our Lord eat an honeycomb? To prove the resurrection: not to give your palate the pleasure of tasting of honey. He asked for a fish broiled on the coals that He might[fn-71-P7144_2357612:110-nf] confirm the doubting Apostles, who did not dare approach Him because they thought they saw not a body, but a spirit.[fn-71-P7145_2357749:111-nf] The daughter of the ruler of the synagogue was raised to life and took food.[fn-71-P7146_2357841:112-nf] Lazarus, who had been four days dead, rose again, and comes before us at a dinner; not because he was accustomed to eat in the lower world, but because a case which presented such difficulties challenged the believer's criticism. As He showed them real hands and a real side, so He really ate with His disciples; really walked with Cleophas; conversed with men with a real tongue; really reclined at supper; with real hands took bread, blessed and brake it, and was offering it to them. And as for His suddenly vanishing out of their sight, that is the power of God, not of a shadowy phantom. Besides, even before His resurrection, when they had led Him out from Nazareth that they might cast Him down headlong from the brow of the hill, He passed through the midst of them, that is, escaped out of their hands. Can we follow Marcion, and say that because, when He was held fast, He escaped in a manner contrary to nature, therefore His birth must have been only apparent? Has not the Lord a privilege which is conceded to magicians? It is related of Apollonius of Tyana that, when standing in court before Domitian, he all at once disappeared. Do not put the power of the Lord on a level with the tricks of magicians, so that He may appear to have been what He was not, and may be thought to have eaten without teeth, walked without feet, broken bread without hands, spoken without a tongue, and showed a side which had no ribs.","title":"To Pammachius Against John of Jerusalem","author":false},{"chapter":8,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_19_lecture_xiv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"13.

For out of Thy compassion for our low estate Thou hast shed forth upon us abundantly that goodness of Thine which is inexhaustible, and with Thy very nature cognate, having redeemed us by Thine only begotten Son, who is unchangeably like to Thee, and of one substance with Thee; judging it unworthy of Thy majesty and goodness to entrust to a servant the work of saving and benefiting Thy servants, or to cause that those who had offended should be reconciled by a minister. But by means of that light, which is of one substance with Thee, Thou hast given light to those that sat in darkness[fn-60-P6079_1865287:66-nf] and in the shadow of death, in order that in Thy light they might see the light of knowledge;[fn-60-P6080_1865420:67-nf] and it has seemed good to Thee, by means of our Lord and Creator, to fashion us again unto immortality; and Thou hast graciously given unto us a return to Paradise by means of Him who separated us from the joys of Paradise; and by means of Him who hath power to forgive sins Thou hast[fn-60-P6081_1865724:68-nf] blotted out the handwriting which was against us.[fn-60-P6082_1865792:69-nf] Lastly, by means of Him who is a partaker of Thy throne and who cannot be separated from Thy divine nature, Thou hast given unto us the gift of reconciliation and access unto Thee with confidence in order that, by the Lord who recognises the sovereign authority of none, by the true and omnipotent God, the subscribed sanction, as it were, of so many and such great blessings might constitute the justifying gifts of grace to be certain and indubitable rights to those who have obtained mercy.

But it is plain that when it has been given, also our good merits begin to be,-yet only by means of it; for, were that only to withdraw itself, man falls, not raised up, but precipitated by free will. Wherefore no man ought, even when he begins to possess good merits, to attribute them to himself, but to God, who is thus addressed by the Psalmist: \"Be Thou my helper, forsake me not.\"[fn-59-P5999_2338785:78-nf] By saying, \"Forsake me not,\" he shows that if he were to be forsaken, he is unable of himself to do any good thing.
