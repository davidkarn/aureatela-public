This vainglorious observer of the commandments was therefore convicted[fn-67-P6795_1982104:1451-nf] of holding money in much higher estimation (than charity). This verity of the gospel then stands unimpaired: \"I am not come to destroy the law and the prophets, but rather to fulfil them.\"[fn-67-P6796_1982316:1452-nf] He also dissipated other doubts, when He declared that the name of God and of the Good belonged to one and the same being, at whose disposal were also the everlasting life and the treasure in heaven and Himself too-whose commandments He both maintained and augmented with His own supplementary precepts. He may likewise be discovered in the following passage of Micah, saying: \"He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to be ready to follow the Lord thy God? \"[fn-67-P6797_1982881:1453-nf] Now Christ is the man who tells us what is good, even the knowledge of the law. \"Thou knowest,\" says He, \"the commandments.\" \"To do justly\"-\"Sell all that thou hast; \"\"to love mercy\"-\"Give to the poor: \"\"and to be ready to walk with God\"-\"And come,\" says He, \"follow me.\"[fn-67-P6798_1983281:1454-nf] The Jewish nation was from its beginning so carefully divided into tribes and clans, and families and houses, that no man could very well have been ignorant of his descent-even from the recent assessments of Augustus, which were still probably extant at this time.[fn-67-P6799_1983662:1455-nf] But the Jesus of Marcion (although there could be no doubt of a person's having been born, who was seen to be a man), as being unborn, could not, of course, have possessed any public testimonial[fn-68-P6800_1983943:1456-nf] of his descent, but was to be regarded as one of that obscure class of whom nothing was in any way known. Why then did the blind man, on hearing that He was passing by, exclaim, \"Jesus, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me? \"[fn-68-P6801_1984188:1457-nf] unless he was considered, in no uncertain manner,[fn-68-P6802_1984263:1458-nf] to be the Son of David (in other words, to belong to David's family) through his mother and his brethren, who at some time or other had been made known to him by public notoriety? \"Those, however, who went before rebuked the blind man, that he should hold his peace.\"[fn-68-P6803_1984552:1459-nf] And properly enough; because he was very noisy, not because he was wrong about the son of David Else you must show me, that those who rebuked him were aware that Jesus was not the Son of David, in order that they may be supposed to have had this reason for imposing silence on the blind man. But even if you could show me this, still (the blind man) would more readily have presumed that they were ignorant, than that the Lord could possibly have permitted an untrue exclamation about Himself. But the Lord \"stood patient.\"[fn-68-P6804_1985101:1460-nf] Yes; but not as confirming the error, for, on the contrary, He rather displayed the Creator. Surely He could not have first removed this man's blindness, in order that he might afterwards cease to regard Him as the Son of David! However,[fn-68-P6805_1985364:1461-nf] that you may not slander[fn-68-P6806_1985406:1462-nf] His patience, nor fasten on Him any charge of dissimulation, nor deny Him to be the Son of David, He very pointedly confirmed the exclamation of the blind man-both by the actual gift of healing, and by bearing testimony to his faith: \"Thy faith,\" say Christ, \"hath made thee whole.\"[fn-68-P6807_1985711:1463-nf] What would you have the blind man's faith to have been? That Jesus was descended from that (alien) god (of Marcion), to subvert the Creator and overthrow the law and the prophets? That He was not the destined offshoot from the root of Jesse, and the fruit of David's loins, the restorer[fn-68-P6808_1986023:1464-nf] also of the blind? But I apprehend there were at that time no such stone-blind persons as Marcion, that an opinion like this could have constituted the faith of the blind man, and have induced him to confide in the mere name,[fn-68-P6809_1986271:1465-nf] of Jesus, the Son of David. He, who knew all this of Himself,[fn-68-P6810_1986444:1466-nf] and wished others to know it also, endowed the faith of this man-although it was already gifted with a better sight, and although it was in possession of the true light-with the external vision likewise, in order that we too might learn the rule of faith, and at the same time find its recompense. Whosoever wishes to see Jesus the Son of David must believe in Him; through the Virgin's birth.[fn-68-P6811_1986889:1467-nf] He who will not believe this will not hear from Him the salutation, \"Thy faith hath saved thee.\" And so he will remain blind, falling into Antithesis after Antithesis, which mutually destroy each other,[fn-68-P6812_1987148:1468-nf] just as \"the blind man leads the blind down into the ditch.\"[fn-68-P6813_1987358:1469-nf] For (here is one of Marcion's Antitheses): whereas David in old time, in the capture of Sion, was offended by the blind who opposed his admission (into the stronghold)[fn-68-P6814_1987640:1470-nf] -in which respect (I should rather say) that they were a type of people equally blind,[fn-68-P6815_1987755:1471-nf] who in after-times would not admit Christ to be the son of David-so, on the contrary, Christ succoured the blind man, to show by this act that He was not David's son, and how different in disposition He was, kind to the blind, while David ordered them to be slain.[fn-68-P6816_1988046:1472-nf] If all this were so, why did Marcion allege that the blind man's faith was of so worthless[fn-68-P6817_1988163:1473-nf] a stamp? The fact is,[fn-68-P6818_1988244:1474-nf] the Son of David so acted,[fn-68-P6819_1988288:1475-nf] that the Antithesis must lose its point by its own absurdity.[fn-68-P6820_1988430:1476-nf] Those persons who offended David were blind, and the man who now presents himself as a suppliant to David's son is afflicted with the same infirmity.[fn-68-P6821_1988668:1477-nf] Therefore the Son of David was appeased with some sort of satisfaction by the blind man when He restored him to sight, and added His approval of the faith which had led him to believe the very truth, that he must win to his help[fn-68-P6822_1988947:1478-nf] the Son of David by earnest entreaty. But, after all, I suspect that it was the audacity (of the old Jebusites) which offended David, and not their malady.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_24_book_ii_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"166","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"120.

And now, to confirm the deductions of reason by the authority of Scripture-viz., that it is our own doing whether we live rightly or not, and that we are not compelled, either by those causes which come to us from without, or, as some think, by the presence of fate-we adduce the testimony of the prophet Micah, in these words: \"If it has been announced to thee, O man, what is good, or what the Lord requires of thee, except that thou shouldst do justice, and love mercy, and be ready to walk with the Lord thy God.\"[fn-68-P6818_1440464:36-nf] Moses also speaks as follows: \"I have placed before thy face the way of life and the way of death: choose what is good, and walk in it.\"[fn-68-P6819_1440618:37-nf] Isaiah, moreover, makes this declaration: \"If you are willing, and hear me, ye shall eat the good of the land. But if you be unwilling, and will not hear me, the sword shall consume you; for the mouth of the Lord has spoken this.\"[fn-68-P6820_1440869:38-nf] In the Psalm, too, it is written: \"If My people had heard Me, if Israel had walked in My ways, I would have humbled her enemies to nothing; \"[fn-68-P6821_1441032:39-nf] by which he shows that it was in the power of the people to hear, and to walk in the ways of God. The Saviour also saying, \"I say unto you, Resist not evil; \"[fn-68-P6822_1441215:40-nf] and, \"Whoever shall be angry with his brother, shall be in danger of the judgment; \"[fn-68-P6823_1441318:41-nf] and, \"Whosoever shall look upon a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart; \"[fn-68-P6824_1441452:42-nf] and in issuing certain other commands,-conveys no other meaning than this, that it is in our own power to observe what is commanded. And therefore we are rightly rendered liable to condemnation if we transgress those commandments which we are able to keep. And hence He Himself also declares: \"Every one who hears my words, and doeth them, I will show to whom he is like: he is like a wise man who built his house upon a rock,\" etc.[fn-68-P6825_1441904:43-nf] So also the declaration: \"Whoso heareth these things, and doeth them not, is like a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand,\" etc.[fn-68-P6826_1442062:44-nf] Even the words addressed to those who are on His right hand, \"Come unto Me, all ye blessed of My Father,\" etc.; \"for I was an hungered, and ye gave Me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave Me drink,\"[fn-68-P6827_1442279:45-nf] manifestly show that it depended upon themselves, that either these should be deserving of praise for doing what was commanded and receiving what was promised, or those deserving of censure who either heard or received the contrary, and to whom it was said, \"Depart, ye cursed, into everlasting fire.\" Let us observe also, that the Apostle Paul addresses us as having power over our own will, and as possessing in ourselves the causes either of our salvation or of our ruin: \"Dost thou despise the riches of His goodness, and of His patience, and of His long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? But, according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, thou art treasuring up for thyself wrath on the day of judgment and of the revelation of the just judgment of God, who will render to every one according to his work: to those who by patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory and immortality, eternal life;[fn-68-P6828_1443253:46-nf] while to those who are contentious, and believe not the truth, but who believe iniquity, anger, indignation, tribulation, and distress, on every soul of man that worketh evil, on the Jew first, and (afterwards) on the Greek; but glory, and honour, and peace to every one that doeth good, to the Jew first, and (afterwards) to the Greek.\"[fn-68-P6829_1443715:47-nf] You will find also innumerable other passages in holy Scripture, which manifestly show that we possess freedom of will. Otherwise there would be a contrariety in commandments being given us, by observing which we may be saved, or by transgressing which we may be condemned, if the power of keeping them were not implanted in us.","title":"Book III.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":6,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_47_book_iii_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"ANF-04","text":"6. Now, that it is our business to live virtuously, and that God asks this of us, as not being dependent on Him nor on any other, nor, as some think, upon fate, but as being our own doing, the prophet Micah will prove when he says: \"If it has been announced to thee, O man, what is good, or what does the Lord require of thee, except to do justice and to love mercy? \"[fn-68-P6831_1444433:48-nf] Moses also: \"I have placed before thy face the way of life, and the way of death: choose what is good, and walk in it.\"[fn-68-P6832_1444570:49-nf] Isaiah too: \"If you are willing, and hear me, ye shall eat the good of the land; but if ye be unwilling, and Will not hear me, the sword will consume you: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.\"[fn-68-P6833_1444804:50-nf] And in the Psalms: \"If My people had heard Me, and Israel had walked in My ways, I would have humbled their enemies to nothing, and laid My hand upon those that afflicted them; \"[fn-68-P6834_1445004:51-nf] showing that it was in the power of His people to hear and to walk in the ways of God.
