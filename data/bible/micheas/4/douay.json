{"verses":["And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of\nthe house of the Lord shall be prepared in the top of the mountains,\nand high above the hills:  and people shall flow to it.","And many nations shall come in haste, and say:  Come, let us go up\nto the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob:  and\nhe will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths:  for the\nlaw shall go forth out of Sion, and the word of the Lord out of\nJerusalem.","And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations\nafar off:  and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their\nspears into spades:  nation shall not take sword against nation:  neither\nshall they learn war anymore.","And every man shall sit under his vine, and under his fig tree,\nand there shall be none to make them afraid, for the mouth of the Lord\nof hosts hath spoken.","For all people will walk every one in the name of his god:  but we\nwill walk in the name of the Lord, our God, for ever and ever.","In that day, saith the Lord, I will gather up her that halteth:\nand her that I had cast out, I will gather up:  and her whom I had\nafflicted.","And I will make her that halted, a remnant:  and her that had been\nafflicted, a mighty nation:  and the Lord will reign over them in Mount\nSion, from this time now and forever.","And thou, O cloudy tower of the flock, of the daughter of Sion,\nunto thee shall it come:  yea the first power shall come, the kingdom to\nthe daughter of Jerusalem.","Now, why art thou drawn together with grief?  Hast thou no king in\nthee, or is thy counselor perished, because sorrow hath taken thee as a\nwoman in labour.","Be in pain and labour, O daughter of Sion, as a woman that\nbringeth forth:  for now shalt thou go out of the city, and shalt dwell\nin the country, and shalt come even to Babylon, there thou shalt be\ndelivered:  there the Lord will redeem thee out of the hand of thy\nenemies.","And now many nations are gathered together against thee, and they\nsay:  Let her be stoned:  and let our eye look upon Sion.","But they have not known the thoughts of the Lord, and have not\nunderstood his counsel:  because he hath gathered them together as the\nhay of the floor.","Arise, and tread, O daughter of Sion:  for I will make thy horn\niron, and thy hoofs I will make brass:  and thou shalt beat in pieces\nmany peoples, and shalt immolate the spoils of them to the Lord, and\ntheir strength to the Lord of the whole earth."]}
