{"verses":["And I said:  Hear, O ye princes of Jacob, and ye chiefs of the\nhouse of Israel:  Is it not your part to know judgment,","You that hate good, and love evil:  that violently pluck off their\nskins from them and their flesh from their bones?","Who have eaten the flesh of my people, and have flayed their skin\noff them:  and have broken, and chopped their bones as for the kettle,\nand as flesh in the midst of the pot.","Then shall they cry to the Lord, and he will not hear them:  and he\nwill hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved\nwickedly in their devices.","Thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that make my people\nerr:  that bite with their teeth, and preach peace:  and if a man give\nnot something into their mouth, they prepare war against him.","Therefore night shall be to you instead of vision, and darkness to\nyou instead of divination:  and the sun shall go down upon the prophets,\nand the day shall be darkened over them.","And they shall be confounded that see visions, and the diviners\nshall be confounded:  and they shall all cover their faces, because\nthere is no answer of God.","But yet I am filled with the strength of the spirit of the Lord,\nwith judgment and power:  to declare unto Jacob his wickedness and to\nIsrael his sin.","Hear this, ye princes of the house of Jacob, and ye judges of the\nhouse of Israel:  you that abhor judgment and pervert all that is right.","You that build up Sion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.","Her princes have judged for bribes:  and her priests have taught\nfor hire, and her prophets divined for money:  and they leaned upon the\nLord, saying:  Is not the Lord in the midst of us?  no evil shall come\namong us.","Therefore because of you, Sion shall be ploughed as a field, and\nJerusalem shall be as a heap of stones, and the mountain of the temple\nas the high places of the forests."]}
