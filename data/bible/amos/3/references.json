But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.\"[fn-45-P4539_1232501:3229-nf] Why, O apostle, is it better to marry?

For this very cause God accuses the Israelites more vehemently, and shows that they were worthy of greater chastisement, because they sinned after so many honors had come to them from Him, saying in one place: \"But you only have I known of all the families of the earth, therefore will I punish you for your iniquities,\"[fn-5-P578_309939:15-nf] and again, \"and I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites;[fn-5-P579_310051:16-nf] and before the times of the prophets, wishing to show that sins receive sorer punishment by far when they occur in the case of the Priest than in the case of the laity, He enjoins as great a sacrifice to be offered for the Priest as for the whole people,[fn-5-P580_310326:17-nf] and this amounts to a proof on his part, that the wounds of the Priesthood need more assistance-that is, as great as those of all the people together, and they would not have needed a greater, except they were worse; and they are not worse in their nature, but are aggravated through the dignity of the Priest, who dares to commit them. And why do I speak of the men who follow this ministration. For the daughters of the Priests,[fn-5-P581_310779:18-nf] who have no part in the Priestly office, yet on account of their father's dignity undergo a far bitterer punishment for the same sins as others, and the offense is the same in their case and in the daughters of the laity; namely, fornication in both; yet the penalty is far severer for the former. Dost thou see with what abundant proof God shows thee that he demands much greater punishment for the ruler than for the ruled? For no doubt he who punishes to a greater degree than others the daughter of a certain man for that man's sake, will not exact the same penalty from the man who is the cause of her additional chastisement as from others, but a much heavier one; and very reasonably; for the mischief does not merely involve himself, but it destroys the souls of the weaker brethren and of them who look up to him, and Ezekiel, writing to show this, distinguishes from one another the judgment of the rams and of the sheep.[fn-5-P582_311731:19-nf] ","title":"Book VI.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":3,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_10_homily_ii_the_earth_was_invisible_and_unfinished_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"It is equally impious to say that evil has its origin from God;[fn-20-P2075_599933:12-nf] because the contrary cannot proceed from its contrary.

And yet at least no one can say to him why hast thou thus done? yea he is at liberty to do all things as he wills. But still as one about to give account, he thus sets up a defence, teaching us to be gentle and loving. For if the master defends himself to his servants, even when they have done him this wrong; much more ought we to defend ourselves to one another, even if we are wronged to the highest degree. See at least how he defends himself. \"Behold they have all one mouth and one speech\" saith he, \"and this they have begun to do,\" as if he said let no one accuse me of this when he sees the division of tongues. Let no one consider that this difference of speech was made over to men from the beginning. \"Behold they all have one mouth, and one speech.\" But they did not use the gift aright. And in order that thou mayest understand that he does not chastise for what has taken place so much as he provides for improvement in the future, hear the sequel \"and now none of all the things will fail them, which they set on foot to do.\"[fn-10-P1013_677710:15-nf] Now what he says, is of such a kind as this. If they do not pay the penalty now, and be restrained from the very root of their sins, they will never cease from wickedness. For this is what \"none of the things will fail them which they set on foot to do\" means, as if he said, and they will add other deeds yet more monstrous. For such a thing is wickedness; if when it has taken a start it be not hindered, as fire catching wood, so it rises to an unspeakable height. Dost thou see that the deprivation of oneness of speech was a work of much lovingkindness? He inflicted difference of speech upon them, in order that they might not fall into greater wickedness. Hold fast this argument then with me, and let it ever be fixed and immoveable in your minds, that not only when he confers benefits but even when he chastises God is good and loving. For even his chastisements and his punishments are the greatest part of his beneficence, the greatest form of his providence. Whenever therefore thou seest that famines have taken place, and pestilences, and drought and immoderate rains, and irregularities in the atmosphere, or any other of the things which chasten human nature, be not distressed, nor be despondent, but worship Him who caused them, marvel at Him for His tender care. For He who does these things is such that He even chastens the body that the soul may become sound. Then does God these things saith one? God does these things, and even if the whole city, nay even if the whole universe were here I will not shrink from saying this. Would that my voice were clearer than a trumpet, and that it were possible to stand in a lofty place, and to cry aloud to all men, and to testify that God does these things. I do not say these things in arrogance but I have the prophet standing at my side, crying and saying, \"There is no evil in the city which the Lord hath not done\"[fn-10-P1014_679613:16-nf] -now evil is an ambiguous term; and I wish that you shall learn the exact meaning of each expression, in order that on account of ambiguity you may not confound the nature of the things, and fall into blasphemy.","title":"Homily I.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":3,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_22_sermon_v_lv_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"3.

Thou hast left us to ourselves. Be we then found in Thee, for in ourselves were we lost. \"Lord, Thou art become our refuge.\" Why then, brethren, should we doubt that the Lord will make us gentle, if we give up ourselves to be tamed by him? Thou hast tamed the lion which thou madest not; shall not He tame thee, who made thee? For from whence didst thou get the power to tame such savage beasts? Art thou their equal in bodily strength? By what power then hast thou been able to tamegreat beasts? The very beasts of burden, as they are called, are by their nature wild. For in their untamed state they are unserviceable. But because custom has never known them except as in the hands and under the bridle and power of men, dost thou imagine that they couldhave been born in this tame state? But now at all events mark the beasts which are unquestionably of savage kind. \"The lion roareth, who doth not fear?\"[fn-32-P3268_1429846:6-nf] And yet wherein is it that thou dost find thyself to be stronger than he?
