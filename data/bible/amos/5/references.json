I hear that in a short space of time you have suffered. several bereavements, that you have buried in quick succession two young unmarried daughters, and that Faustina, most chaste and loyal of wives, your sister in the fervour of her faith and your one comfort in the loss of your children, has suddenly fallen asleep and been taken from you. You have been like a shipwrecked man, who has no sooner reached the shore than he falls into the hands of brigands, or in the eloquent language of the prophet like one \"who did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.\"[fn-43-P4318_1176088:3075-nf] Pecuniary losses have followed your bereavements; the entire province has been overrun by a barbarian enemy, and in the general devastation your private property has been destroyed, your flocks and herds have been driven off, and your poor slaves either made prisoners or else slain. To crown all, your only daughter, made all the more dear to you by the loss of the others, has for her husband a young nobleman who, to say nothing worse of him, has given you more occasion for sorrow than for rejoicing. Such is the list of the trials that have been laid upon you; such is the conflict waged by the old enemy against Julian a raw recruit to Christ's standard. If you look only to yourself your troubles are indeed great but if you look to the strong Warrior,[fn-43-P4319_1176869:3076-nf] they are but child's play and the conflict is only the semblance of one. After untold trials a wicked wife was still left to the blessed Job, the devil hoping that he might learn from her to blaspheme God. You on the other hand have been deprived of an excellent one that you might learn to go without consolation in the hour of misfortune. Yet it is far harder to put up with a wife whom you dislike than it is to mourn for one whom you dearly love. Moreover when Job's children died they found a common tomb beneath the ruins of his house, and all he could do to shew his parental affection was to rend his garments to fall upon the ground and to worship, saying: \"Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away: it has been as the Lord pleased: blessed be the name of the Lord.\"[fn-43-P4320_1177750:3077-nf] But you, to put the matter briefly, have been allowed to perform the obsequies of your dear ones; and those obsequies have been attended by many respectful kinsmen and comforting friends. Again Job lost all his wealth at once; and, as, one after another, the messengers of woe unfolded new calamities, he flinched as little as the sage of whom Horace writes:[fn-43-P4321_1178138:3078-nf] -","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":5,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":31,"source_paragraph":"195","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"73. So, since no human voice is strong enough to be heard in such a disturbance, I reckon silence more profitable than speech, for if there is any truth in the words of the Preacher, \"The words of wise men are heard in quiet,\"[fn-19-P1961_541497:645-nf] in the present condition of things any discussion of them must be anything but becoming.

Hence merciless and sour sit the judges of the erring; unfeeling and hostile are the critics of the well disposed.

It was to give day the privileges of seniority that Scripture put the end of the first day before that of the first night, because night follows day: for, before the creation of light, the world was not in night, but in darkness. It is the opposite of day which was called night, and it did not receive its name until after day. Thus were created the evening and the morning.[fn-21-P2109_617638:37-nf] Scripture means the space of a day and a night, and afterwards no more says day and night, but calls them both under the name of the more important: a custom which you will find throughout Scripture. Everywhere the measure of time is counted by days, without mention of nights. \"The days of our years,\"[fn-21-P2110_618142:38-nf] says the Psalmist. \"Few and evil have the days of the years of my life been,\"[fn-21-P2111_618237:39-nf] said Jacob, and elsewhere \"all the days of my life.\"[fn-21-P2112_618310:40-nf] Thus under the form of history the law is laid down for what is to follow.And the evening and the morning were one day.[fn-21-P2113_618454:41-nf] Why does Scripture say \"one day the first day\"? Before speaking to us of the second, the third, and the fourth days, would it not have been more natural to call that one the first which began the series? If it therefore says \"one day,\" it is from a wish to determine the measure of day and night, and to combine the time that they contain. Now twenty-four hours fill up the space of one day-we mean of a day and of a night; and if, at the time of the solstices, they have not both an equal length, the time marked byScripture does not the less circumscribe their duration. It is as though it said: twenty-four hours measure the space of a day, or that, in reality a day is the time that the heavens starting from one point take to return there. Thus, every time that, in the revolution of the sun, evening and morning occupy the world, their periodical succession never exceeds the space of one day.But must we believe in a mysterious reason for this? God who made the nature of time measured it out and determined it by intervals of days; and, wishing to give it a week as a measure, he ordered the week to revolve from period to period upon itself, to count the movement of time, forming the week of one day revolving seven times upon itself: a proper circle begins and ends with itself. Such is also the character of eternity, to revolve upon itself and to end nowhere. If then the beginning of time is called \"one day\" rather than \"the first day,\" it is because Scripture wishes to establish its relationship with eternity. It was, in reality, fit and natural to call \"one\" the day whose character is to be one wholly separated and isolated from all the others. If Scripturespeaks to us of many ages, saying everywhere, \"age of age, and ages of ages,\" we do not see it enumerate them as first, second, and third. It follows that we are hereby shown not so much limits, ends and succession of ages, as distinctions between various states and modes of action. \"The day of the Lord,\" Scripture says, \"is great and very terrible,\"[fn-21-P2114_620516:42-nf] and elsewhere \"Woe unto you that desire the day of the Lord: to what end is it for you? The day of the Lord is darkness and not light.\"[fn-21-P2115_620671:43-nf] A day of darkness for those who are worthy of darkness. No; this day without evening, without succession and without end is not unknown to Scripture, and it is the day that the Psalmist calls the eighth day, because it is outside this time of weeks.[fn-21-P2116_620938:44-nf] Thus whether you call it day, or whether you call it eternity, you express the same idea. Give this state the name of day; there are not several, but only one. If you call it eternity still it is unique and not manifold. Thus it is in order that you may carry your thoughts forward towards a future life, that Scripture marks by the word \"one\" the day which is the type of eternity, the first fruits of days, the contemporary of light, the holy Lord's day honoured by the Resurrection of our Lord.

What means the expression, \"Living oracles\" (loUia)? Those, whereof the end was shown by words (dia loUwn): in other words, he means the prophecies.[fn-7-P767_646604:3-nf] Then follows the charge, in the first instance, against the patriarchs [after], the \"signs and wonders,\" after the receiving of the \"lively oracles: To whom,\" he says, \"our fathers would not obey.\" (v. 39.)

Where[fn-7-P769_648870:5-nf] they ought to give thanks (to God), they bring Moses forward: where it was, to do as the Law bade them, they no longer make account of Moses. \"We know not what is become of him.\" And yet he told them that he was going up to receive the Law: and they had not patience to wait forty days. \"Make us gods\"-they[fn-7-P770_649300:6-nf] did not say, \"a God.\"-And yet one may well wonder at this, that they do not even know.-\"And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifices unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands\" (v. 41): for which they ought to have hid their faces. What wonder that ye know not Christ, seeing ye knew not Moses, and God Who was manifested by such wonders? But they not only knew Him not: they also insulted in another way, by their idol making. \"Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven\" (v. 42.) Hence these same \"customs\" date their origin, hence the sacrifices: they were themselves the first that made sacrifices to their idols! For that is why it is marked,[fn-7-P771_650369:7-nf] \"They made a calf in Horeb, and offered sacrifices to the idol:\" seeing that, before this the name of sacrifice is nowhere mentioned, but only lively ordinances, and \"lively oracles. And rejoiced\"-that is the reason for the feasts. Exod. xxxii. 5, 6.) \"As it is written in the Book of the Prophets\"-and observe, he does not cite the text without a purpose, but shows by it that there is no need of sacrifices; saying: \"Did ye offer slain beasts and sacrifice to Me?\"-He lays an emphasis on this word (to Me?). \"Ye cannot say that it was from sacrificing to Me, that ye proceeded to sacrifice to them:-\"by the space of forty years:\" and this too, \"in the wilderness,\" where He had most signally shown Himself their Protector. \"Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan: images which ye made to worship them.[fn-7-P772_654093:8-nf] The cause of sacrifices! \"And I will carry you away beyond Babylon.\" (v. 43.) Even the captivity, an impeachment of their wickedness! \"But a Tabernacle,\" say you, \"there was (the Tabernacle) `of Witness.'\" (v. 44.) (Yes,) this is why it was: that they should have God for Witness: this was all. \"According to the fashion,\" it says, \"that was shown thee on the mount:\" so[fn-7-P773_655573:9-nf] that on the mount was the Original.

Whom He drave out,\" he says: and even then, no Temple! And so many wonders, and no mention of a Temple! So that, although first there is a Tabernacle, yet nowhere a Temple. \"Until the days of David,\" he says: even David, and no Temple! \"And he sought to find favor before God\" (v. 46): and built not:-so far was the Temple from being a great matter! \"But Solomon built Him an house.\" (v. 47.) They thought Solomon was great: but that he was not better than his father, nay not even equal to him, is manifest. \"Howbeit the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet, Heaven is My throne, and earth is My footstool.\" (v. 48, 49.) Nay, not even these are worthy of God, forasmuch as they are made, seeing they are creatures, the works of His hand. See how he leads them on by little and little (showing) that not even these are to be mentioned.

He did not therefore seek, by any depreciation of the mundane elements, to turn them away from their god, although, when he said just before, \"Howbeit, then, ye serve them which by nature are no gods,\"[fn-73-P7304_2109768:151-nf] he censured the error of that physical or natural superstition which holds the elements to be god; but at the God of those elements he aimed not in this censure.[fn-73-P7305_2109949:152-nf] He tells us himself clearly enough what he means by \"elements,\" even the rudiments of the law: \"Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years\"[fn-73-P7306_2110119:153-nf] -the sabbaths, I suppose, and \"the preparations,\"[fn-73-P7307_2110189:154-nf] and the fasts, and the \"high days.\"[fn-73-P7308_2110298:155-nf] For the cessation of even these, no less than of circumcision, was appointed by the Creator's decrees, who had said by Isaiah, \"Your new moons, and your sabbaths, and your high days I cannot bear; your fasting, and feasts, and ceremonies my soul hateth; \"[fn-73-P7309_2110584:156-nf] also by Amos, \"I hate, I despise your feast-days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies; \"[fn-73-P7310_2110707:157-nf] and again by Hosea, \"I will cause to cease all her mirth, and her feast-days, and her sabbaths, and her new moons, and all her solemn assemblies.\"[fn-73-P7311_2110873:158-nf] The institutions which He set up Himself, you ask, did He then destroy? Yes, rather than any other. Or if another destroyed them, he only helped on the purpose of the Creator, by removing what even He had condemned. But this is not the place to discuss the question why the Creator abolished His own laws. It is enough for us to have proved that He intended such an abolition, that so it may be affirmed that the apostle determined nothing to the prejudice of the Creator, since the abolition itself proceeds from the Creator. But as, in the case of thieves, something of the stolen goods is apt to drop by the way, as a clue to their detection; so, as it seems to me, it has happened to Marcion: the last mention of Abraham's name he has left untouched (in the epistle), although no passage required his erasure more than this, even his partial alteration of the text.[fn-73-P7312_2111763:159-nf] \"For (it is written) that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bond maid, the other by a free woman; but he who was of the bond maid was born after the flesh, but he of the free woman was by promise: which things are allegorized\"[fn-73-P7313_2112197:160-nf] (that is to say, they presaged something besides the literal history); \"for these are the two covenants,\" or the two exhibitions (of the divine plans),[fn-73-P7314_2112560:161-nf] as we have found the word interpreted,\" the one from the Mount Sinai,\" in relation to the synagogue of the Jews, according to the law, \"which gendereth to bondage\"-\"the other gendereth\" (to liberty, being raised) above all principality, and power, and dominion, and every name that is l named, not only in this world, but in that which is to come, \"which is the mother of us all,\" in which we have the promise of (Christ's) holy church; by reason of which he adds in conclusion: \"So then, brethren, we are not children of the bond woman, but of the free.\"[fn-73-P7315_2113158:162-nf] In this passage he has undoubtedly shown that Christianity had a noble birth, being sprung, as the mystery of the allegory indicates, from that son of Abraham who was born of the free woman; whereas from the son of the bond maid came the legal bondage of Judaism. Both dispensations, therefore, emanate from that same God by whom,[fn-73-P7316_2113516:163-nf] as we have found, they were both sketched out beforehand. When he speaks of \"the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free,\"[fn-73-P7317_2113660:164-nf] does not the very phrase indicate that He is the Liberator who was once the Master? For Galba himself never liberated slaves which were not his own, even when about to restore free men to their liberty.[fn-73-P7318_2113881:165-nf] By Him, therefore, will liberty be bestowed, at whose command lay the enslaving power of the law. And very properly. It was not meet that those who had received liberty should be \"entangled again with the yoke of bondage\"[fn-73-P7319_2114436:166-nf] -that is, of the law; now that the Psalm had its prophecy accomplished: \"Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us, since the rulers have gathered themselves together against the Lord and against His Christ.\"[fn-73-P7320_2114689:167-nf] All those, therefore, who had been delivered from the yoke of slavery he would earnestly have to obliterate the very mark of slavery-even circumcision, on the authority of the prophet'sprediction. He remembered how that Jeremiah had said, \"Circumcise the foreskins of your heart; \"[fn-73-P7321_2114992:168-nf] as Moses likewise had enjoined, \"Circumcise your hard hearts\"[fn-73-P7322_2115073:169-nf] -not the literal flesh. If, now, he were for excluding circumcision, as the messenger of a new god, why does he say that \"in Christ neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision?[fn-73-P7323_2115285:170-nf] For it was his duty to prefer the rival principle of that which he was abolishing, if he had a mission from the god who was the enemy of circumcision.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_33_oration_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"25","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"21.

Now the gates of Zion may be conceived as opposed to the gates of death, so that there is one gate of death, dissoluteness, but a gate of Zion, self-control; and so a gate of death, unrighteousness, but a gate of Zion, righteousness, which the prophet shows forth saying, \"This is the gate of the Lord, the righteous shall enter into it.\"[fn-79-P7939_1688414:93-nf] And again there is cowardice, a gate of death, but manly courage, a gate of Zion; and want of prudence, a gate of death, but its opposite, prudence, a gate of Zion. But to all the gates of the \"knowledge which is falsely so called\"[fn-79-P7940_1688668:94-nf] one gate is opposed, the gate of knowledge which is free from falsehood. But consider if, because of the saying , \"our wrestling is not against flesh and blood,\"[fn-79-P7941_1688850:95-nf] etc., you can say that each power and world-ruler of this darkness, and each one of the \"spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places\"[fn-79-P7942_1689011:96-nf] is a gate of Hades and a gate of death. Let, then, the principalities and powers with which our wrestling is, be called gates of Hades, but the \"ministering spirits\"[fn-79-P7943_1689195:97-nf] gates of righteousness. But as in the case of the better things many gates are first spoken of, and after the gates, one, in the passage, \"Open to me the gates of righteousness, I will enter into them, and will make full confession to the Lord,\" and \"this is the gate of the Lord, by it the righteous shall enter; \"[fn-79-P7944_1689528:98-nf] so also in the case of those gates which are opposed, many are the gates of Hades and death, each a power; but over all these the wicked one himself. And let us take heed in regard to each sin, as if we were descending into some gate of death if we sin; but when we are lifted up from the gates of death let us declare all the praises of the Lord in the gates of the daughter of Zion; as, for example, in one gate of the daughter of Zion-that which is called self-control-we will declare by our self-control the praises of God; and in another which is called righteousness, by righteousness we will declare the praises of God; and, generally, in all things whatsoever of a praiseworthy character with which we are; occupied, in these we are at some gate of the daughter of Zion, declaring at each gate some praise of God. But we must make inquiry whether in one of the Twelve[fn-79-P7945_1690429:99-nf] it is said, \"They hated him that reproveth in the gates, and they loathed the holy word.\"[fn-79-P7946_1690554:100-nf] Perhaps, then, he who reproves in the gates is of the gates of the daughter of Zion, reproving those who are in sins which are opposed to this gate, even of the gates of Hades or death.

Out of Zion is the perfection of His beauty. God, even our God, shall come openly, and shall not keep silence. Fire shall burn before Him, and it shall be very temptestuous round about Him. He shall call to the heavens above, and to the earth, that He may judge His people. Assemble to Him His saints; those that have made a covenant with Him by sacrifices. And the heavens shall declare His righteousness, for God is judge. Hear, O My people, and I will speak to thee; O Israel, and I will testify to thee, I am God, even thy God. I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices; thy burnt-offerings are continually before me. I will take no bullocks out of thy house, nor he-goats out of thy folds: for all the beasts of the field are Mine, the herds and the oxen on the mountains.

When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst with him; and hast been partaker with the adulterer. Thy mouth has framed evil, and thy tongue has enfolded deceit.

Do you fear to speak of Generation lest you should attribute aught of passion to the impassible God? I on the other hand fear to speak of Creation, lest I should destroy God by the insult and the untrue division, either cutting the Son away from the Father, or from the Son the Substance of the Spirit. For this paradox is involved, that not only is a created Life foisted into the Godhead by those who measure Godhead badly; but even this created life is divided against itself. For as these low earthly minds make the Son subject to the Father, so again is the rank of the Spirit made inferior to that of the Son, until both God and created life are insulted by the new Theology. No, my friends, there is nothing servile in the Trinity, nothing created, nothing accidental, as I have heard one of the wise[fn-53-P5318_1765010:180-nf] say.

They (the Jews) had therefore a law, a course of discipline, and a prophecy of future things. For God at the first, indeed, warning them by means of natural precepts, which from the beginning He had implanted in mankind, that is, by means of the Decalogue (which, if any one does not observe, he has no salvation), did then demand nothing more of them. As Moses says in Deuteronomy, \"These are all the words which the Lord spake to the whole assembly of the sons of Israel on the mount, and He added no more; and He wrote them on two tables of stone, and gave them to me.\"[fn-82-P8243_2292624:172-nf] For this reason [He did so], that they who are willing to follow Him might keep these commandments.

And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifices to the idol, and were rejoicing in the works of their own hands. But God turned, and gave them up to worship the hosts of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets:[fn-82-P8246_2294152:175-nf] O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to Me sacrifices and oblations for forty years in the wilderness?

Nor can it be said that I have been entrusted indeed with the charge, but yet have not executed it. Or rather, it is not I that have executed, but Christ.
