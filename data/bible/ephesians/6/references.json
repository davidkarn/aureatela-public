Let your fasts be of daily occurrence and your refreshment such as avoids satiety. It is idle to carry an empty stomach if, in two or three days' time, the fast is to be made up for by repletion.

But if any one thinks it hard or reprehensible that I have placed the same interval between virginity and wedlock as there is between fine corn and barley, let him read the book of the holy Ambrose \"On Widows,\" and he will find, among other statements concerning virginity and marriage, the following:[fn-16-P1642_382084:1137-nf] \"The apostle has not expressed his preference for marriage so unreservedly as to quench in men the aspiration after virginity; he commences with a recommendation of continence, and it is only subsequently that he stoops to mention the remedies for its opposite. And although to the strong he has pointed out the prize of their high calling,[fn-16-P1643_382485:1138-nf] yet he suffers none to faint by the way;[fn-16-P1644_382550:1139-nf] whilst he applauds those who lead the van, he does, not despise those who bring up the rear.

For the law binds the wife to bring forth children in labor and in sorrow. Her desire is to be to her husband that he should rule over her.[fn-16-P1646_383161:1141-nf] It is not the widow, then, but the bride, who is handed over to labor and sorrow in childbearing. It is not the virgin, but the married woman, who is subjected to the sway of a husband.\" And in another place, \"Ye are bought,\" says the apostle, \"with a price;[fn-16-P1647_383443:1142-nf] be not therefore the servants of men.\"[fn-16-P1648_383522:1143-nf] You see how clearly he defines the servitude which attends the married state. And a little farther on: \"If, then, even a good marriage is servitude, what must a bad one be, in which husband and wife cannot sanctify, but only mutually destroy each other?\" What I have said about virginity and marriage diffusely, Ambrose has stated tersely and pointedly, compressing much meaning into a few words. Virginity is described by him as a means of recommending continence, marriage as a remedy for incontinence. And when he descends from broad principles to particular details, he significantly holds out to virgins the prize of the high calling, yet comforts the married, that they may not faint by the way. While eulogizing the one class, he does not despise the other. Marriage he compares to the barley bread set before the multitude, virginity to the body of Christ given to the disciples. There is much less difference, it seems to me, between barley and fine corn than between barley and the body of Christ. Finally, he speaks of marriage as a hard burden, to be avoided if possible, and as a badge of the most unmistakable servitude.

They serve only to inflame young men's passions, to stimulate lust, and to indicate an unchaste mind.

For the compilers of catence have naturally selected what was best in Origen, and most suited for short extracts; his eccentricities have been in great measure omitted. Hence we may err in attributing to Hilary much that is perverse in his comments; there is an abundance of wild mysticism in the fragments of Origen, but its proportion to the whole is undoubtedly less in their present state than in their original condition. Hilary's method was that of paraphrasing, not of servile translation. There is apparently only one literal rendering of an extant passage of Origen, and that a short one[fn-2-P263_196230:114-nf] ; but paraphrases, which often become very diffuse expansions, are constant[fn-2-P264_196406:115-nf] . But a just comparison between the two must embrace their differences as well as their resemblances. Hilary has exercised a silent criticism in omitting many of Origen's textual disquisitions. He gives, it is true, many various readings, but his confidence in the Septuagint often renders him indifferent in regard to divergencies which Origen had taken seriously. The space which the latter devotes to the Greek versions Hilary employs in correcting the errors and variations of the Latin, or in explaining the meaning of Greek words. But these are matters which rather belong to the next chapter, concerning, as they do, Hilary's attitude towards Scripture. It is more significant of his tone of mind that he has omitted Origen's speculations on the resurrection of the body, preserved by Epiphanius[fn-2-P265_197489:116-nf] , and on the origin of evil[fn-2-P266_197541:117-nf] . Again, Origen delights to give his readers a choice of interpretations; Hilary chooses one of those which Origen has given, and makes no mention of the other. This is his constant habit in the earlier part of the Homilies; towards the end, however, he often gives a rendering of his own, and also mentions, either as possible or as wrong, that which Origen had offered. Or else, though he only makes his own suggestion, yet it is obvious to those who have Origen at hand that he has in his mind, and is refuting for his own satisfaction, an alternative which he does not think good to lay before his audience[fn-2-P267_198235:118-nf] . A similar liberty with his original occurs in the Homily on Psalm 135, § I2:-'The purposes of the present discourse and of this place forbid us to search more deeply.' This must have seemed a commonplace to his hearers; but it happens that Origen's speculations upon the passage have survived, and we can see that Hilary was rather making excuses to himself for his disregard of them than directly addressing his congregation. Apart from the numerous instances where Hilary derives a different result from the same data, there are certain cases where he accepts the current Latin text, thought it differed from Origen's Greek, and draws, without any reference to Origen, his own conclusions as to the meaning[fn-2-P268_199124:119-nf] . These, again, seem to be confined to the latter part of the work, and may be the result of occasional neglect to consult the authorities, rather than a deliberate departure from Origen's teaching.","title":"Introduction","author":false},{"chapter":6,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_05_procatechesis","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"17","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"10.

Pray, art thou not aware that that body is subject to more diseases and assaults than this flesh of ours, is more quickly corrupted, and more slow to recover? and by those who have the healing of these bodies, divers medicines have been discovered, and an apparatus of different instruments, and diet suitable for the sick; and often the condition of the atmosphere is of itself enough for the recovery of a sick man; and there are instances of seasonable sleep having saved the physician all further labor. But in the case before us, it is impossible to take any of these things into consideration; nay there is but one method and way of healing appointed, after we have gone wrong, and that is, the powerful application of the Word. This is the one instrument, the only diet, the finest atmosphere. This takes the place of physic, cautery and cutting, and if it be needful to sear and amputate, this is the means which we must use, and if this be of no avail, all else is wasted; with this we both rouse the soul when it sleeps, and reduce it when it is inflamed; with this we cut off excesses, and fill up defects, and perform all manner of other operations which are requisite for the soul's health. Now as regards the ordering of our daily life for the best, it is true that the life of another may provoke us to emulation. But in the matter of spurious doctrine, when any soul is diseased thereby, then there is great need of the Word, not only in view of the safety of our own people, but in view of the enemy without. If, indeed, one had the sword of the spirit, and the shield of faith,[fn-4-P471_235063:25-nf] so as to be able to work miracles, and by means of these marvels to stop the mouths of impudent gainsayers, one would have little need of the assistance of the Word; still in the days of miracles the Word was by no means useless, but essentially necessary. For St. Paul made use of it himself, although he was everywhere so great an object of wonder for his miracles; and another[fn-4-P472_235466:26-nf] of those who belonged to the \"glorious company of the Apostles\" exhorts us to apply ourselves to acquiring this power, when he says: \"Be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason concerning the hope that is in you,\" and they all, with one accord, committed the care of the poor widows to Stephen, for no other reason than that they themselves might have leisure \"for the ministry of the Word.\"[fn-4-P473_236031:27-nf] To this we ought equally to apply ourselves, unless indeed we are endued with a power of working miracles. But if there is not the least sign of such a power being left us, while on every side many enemies are constantly attacking us, why then it necessarily follows that we should arm ourselves with this weapon, both in order that we may not be wounded ourselves with the darts of the enemy, and in order that we may wound him.","title":"Book IV.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":6,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"82","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"18.

They asserted the divinity of the Holy Spirit[fn-10-P1050_466332:19-nf] and comprehended him in the consubstantial Trinity: they also declared that the Word in being made man, assumed not only flesh, but also a soul, in accordance with the views of the early ecclesiastics. For they did not introduce any new doctrine of their own devising into the church, but contented themselves with recording their sanction of those points which ecclesiastical tradition has insisted on from the beginning, and wise Christians have demonstratively taught. Such sentiments the ancient fathers have uniformly maintained in all their controversial writings. Irenaeus, Clemens, Apollinaris of Hierapolis, and Serapion who presided over the church at Antioch, assure us in their several works, that it was the generally received opinion that Christ in his incarnation was endowed with a soul. Moreover, the Synod convened on account of Beryllus[fn-10-P1051_467451:20-nf] bishop of Philadelphia in Arabia, recognized the same doctrine in their letter to that prelate. Origen also every where in his extant works accepts that the Incarnate God took on himself a human soul. But he more particularly explains this mystery in the ninth volume of his Comments upon Genesis, where he shows that Adam and Eve were types of Christ and the church. That holy man Pamphilus, and Eusebius who was surnamed after him, are trustworthy witnesses on this subject: both these witnesses in their joint life of Origen, and admirable defense of him in answer to such as were prejudiced against him, prove that he was not the first who made this declaration, but that in doing so he was the mere expositor of the mystical tradition of the church. Those who assisted at the Alexandrian Council examined also with great minuteness the question concerning `Essence' or `Substance,' and `Existence,' `Subsistence,' or `Personality.' For Hosius, bishop of Cordova in Spain, who has been before referred to as having been sent by the Emperor Constantine to allay the excitement which Arius had caused, originated the controversy about these terms in his earnestness to overthrow the dogma of Sabellius the Libyan. In the council of Nicaea, however, which was held soon after, this dispute was not agitated; but in consequence of the contention about it which subsequently arose, the matter was freely discussed at Alexandria.[fn-10-P1052_469164:21-nf] It was there determined that such expressions as ousia and hypostasis ought not to be used in reference to God: for they argued that the word ousia is nowhere employed in the sacred Scriptures; and that the apostle has misapplied the term hypostasis[fn-10-P1053_469859:22-nf] owing to an inevitable necessity arising from the nature of the doctrine. They nevertheless decided that in refutation of the Sabellian error these terms were admissible, in default of more appropriate language, lest it should be supposed that one thing was indicated by a threefold designation; whereas we ought rather to believe that each of those named in the Trinity is God in his own proper person. Such were the decisions of this Synod. If we may express our own judgment concerning substance and personality, it appears to us that the Greek philosophers have given us various definitions of ousia, but have not taken the slightest notice of hypostasis. Irenaenus[fn-10-P1054_470545:23-nf] the grammarian indeed, in his Alphabetical [Lexicon entitled] Atticistes, even declares it to be a barbarous term; for it is not to be found in any of the ancients, except occasionally in a sense quite different from that which is attached to it in the present day. Thus Sophocles, in his tragedy entitled Phoenix, uses it to signify `treachery': in Menander it implies `sauces'; as if one should call the `sediment' at the bottom of a hogshead of wine hypostasis. But although the ancient philosophical writers scarcely noticed this word, the more modern ones have frequently used it instead of ousia. This term, as we before observed, has been variously defined: but can that which is capable of being circumscribed by a definition be applicable to God who is incomprehensible? Evagrius in his Monachicus,[fn-10-P1055_471379:24-nf] cautions us against rash and inconsiderate language in reference to God; forbidding all attempt to define the divinity, inasmuch as it is wholly simple in its nature: `for,' says he, `definition belongs only to things which are compound.' The same author further adds, `Every proposition has either a \"genus\" which is predicted, or a \"species,\" or a \"differentia,\" or a \"proprium,\" or an \"accidens,\" or that which is compounded of these: but none of these can be supposed to exist in the sacred Trinity. Let then what is inexplicable be adored in silence.'

So truly is this the case, that unless the laics as well observe the rules which are to guide the choice of presbyters, how will there be presbyters at all, who are chosen to that office from among the laics? Hence we are bound to contend that the command to abstain from second marriage relates first to the laic; so long as no other can be a presbyter than a laic, provided he have been once for all a husband.","title":"V.

He was a native of Neocaesarea in Pontus, of greater antiquity than the one above referred to, inasmuch as he was a disciple of Origen.[fn-14-P1437_630597:79-nf] This Gregory's fame was celebrated at Athens, at Berytus, throughout the entire diocese of Pontus, and I might almost add in the whole world. When he had finished his education in the schools of Athens, he went to Berytus to study civil law, where hearing that Origen expounded the Holy Scriptures at Caesarea, he quickly proceeded thither; and after his understanding had been opened to perceive the grandeur of these Divine books, bidding adieu to all further cultivation of the Roman laws, he became thenceforth inseparable from Origen, from whom having acquired a knowledge of the true philosophy, he was recalled soon after by his parents and returned to his own country; and there, while still a layman, he performed many miracles, healing the sick, and casting out devils even by his letters, insomuch that the pagans were no less attracted to the faith by his acts, than by his discourses. Pamphilus Martyr mentions this person in the books which he wrote in defence of Origen; to which there is added a commendatory oration of Gregory's, composed in praise of Origen, when he was under the necessity of leaving him. There were then, to be brief, several Gregories: the first and most ancient was the disciple of Origen; the second was the bishop of Nazianzus; the third was Basil's brother; and there was another Gregory[fn-14-P1438_631993:80-nf] whom the Arians constituted bishop during the exile of Athanasius.

Novatus,[fn-14-P1444_632794:82-nf] a presbyter of the Roman Church, separated from it, because Cornelius the bishop received into communion believers who had sacrificed during the persecution which the Emperor Decius[fn-14-P1445_633223:83-nf] had raised against the Church. Having seceded on this account, on being afterwards elevated to the episcopacy by such bishops as entertained similar sentiments, he wrote to all the churches[fn-14-P1446_633859:84-nf] that `they should not admit to the sacred mysteries those who had sacrificed; but exhorting them to repentance, leave the pardoning of their offense to God, who has the power to forgive all sin.'

And he who sows to the flesh (the words are not mine, but the Apostle's) reaps corruption. God the Father chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world, that we might be holy and without spot before Him.[fn-64-P6454_1997907:284-nf] We walked in the lusts of the flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts, and were children of wrath, even as the rest.

If then we have risen with Christ, let us seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God; let us set our affections on things above, not upon the things that are upon the earth.

But that service which is due to men, and in reference to which the apostle writes that servants must be subject to their own masters,[fn-15-P1592_901032:2-nf] is usually designated by another word in Greek,[fn-15-P1593_901096:3-nf] whereas the service which is paid to God alone by worship, is always, or almost always, called ltreli/a in the usage of those who wrote from the divine oracles. This cannot so well be called simply \"cultus,\" for in that case it would not seem to be due exclusively to God; for the same word is applied to the respect we pay either to the memory or the living presence of men. From it, too, we derive the words agriculture, colonist, and others.[fn-15-P1594_901639:4-nf] And the heathen call their gods \"coelicolae,\" not because they worship heaven, but because they dwell in it, and as it were colonize it,-not in the sense in which we call those colonists who are attached to their native soil to cultivate it under the rule of the owners, but in the sense in which the great master of the Latin language says, \"There was an ancient city inhabited by Tyrian colonists.\"[fn-15-P1595_902070:5-nf] He called them colonists, not because they cultivated the soil, but because they inhabited the city. So, too, cities that have hired off from larger cities are called colonies.

For they entered into these marriages not for the sake of appetite, but out of regard for the propagation of mankind. Fathers, \"bring up your children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; \"[fn-20-P2005_339234:31-nf] and teach them the holy Scriptures, and also trades, that they may not indulge in idleness.

The apostle Peter, to whom it was said,[fn-66-P6611_2070323:21-nf] \"He that is bathed needeth not to wash again,\" and[fn-66-P6612_2070397:22-nf] \"Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church,\" through fear of a maid-servant denied Him. Our Lord himself says,[fn-66-P6613_2070547:23-nf] \"Simon, Simon, behold Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat. But I made supplication for thee, that thy faith fail not.\" And in the same place, \"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.\" If you reply that this was said before the Passion, we certainly say after the Passion, in the Lord's prayer,[fn-66-P6614_2070948:24-nf] \"Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.\" If we do not sin after baptism, why do we ask that we may be forgiven our sins, which were already forgiven in baptism? Why do we pray that we may not enter into temptation, and that we may be delivered from the evil one, if the devil cannot tempt those who are baptized? The case is different if this prayer belongs to the Catechumens, and is not adapted to faithful Christians. Paul, the chosen vessel,[fn-66-P6615_2071498:25-nf] chastised his body, and brought it into subjection, lest after preaching to others he himself should be found a reprobate, and[fn-66-P6616_2071645:26-nf] he tells that there was given to him \"a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet\" him. And to the Corinthians he writes:[fn-66-P6617_2071797:27-nf] \"I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is toward Christ.\" And elsewhere:[fn-66-P6618_2071981:28-nf] \"But to whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also: for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes have I forgiven it in the person of Christ: that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices.\" And again:[fn-66-P6619_2072287:29-nf] \"There hath no temptation taken you, but such as man can bear; but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make also the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it.\" And,[fn-66-P6620_2072550:30-nf] \"Let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.\" And to the Galatians:[fn-66-P6621_2072652:31-nf] \"Ye were running well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?\" And elsewhere:[fn-66-P6622_2072761:32-nf] \"We would fain have come unto you, I Paul once and again; and Satan hindered us.\" And to the married he says:[fn-66-P6623_2072893:33-nf] \"Be together again, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency.\" And again:[fn-66-P6624_2073000:34-nf] \"But I say, walk by the Spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other: that ye may not do the things that ye would.\" We are a compound of the two, and must endure the strife of the two substances. And to the Ephesians:[fn-66-P6625_2073376:35-nf] \"Our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.\" Does any one think that we are safe, and that it is right to fall asleep when once we have been baptized? And so, too, in the epistle to the Hebrews:[fn-66-P6626_2073753:36-nf] \"For as touching those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come, and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.\" Surely we cannot deny that they have been baptized who have been illuminated, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God. Butif the baptized cannot sin, how is it now that the Apostle says, \"And have fallen away\"?[fn-66-P6627_2074420:37-nf] Montanus and[fn-66-P6628_2075404:38-nf] Novatus would smile at this, for they contend that it is impossible to renew again through repentance those who have crucified to themselves the Son of God, and put Him to an open shame. He therefore corrects this mistake by saying:[fn-66-P6629_2076011:39-nf] \"But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak; for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and the love which ye shewed towards his name, in that ye ministered unto the Saints, and still do minister.\" And truly the unrighteousness of God would be great, if He merely punished sin, and did not welcome good works. I have so spoken, says the Apostle, to withdraw you from your sins, and to make you more careful through fear of despair. But, beloved, I am persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation. For it is not accordant with the righteousness of God to forget good works, and the fact that you have ministered and do minister to the Saints for His name's sake, and to remember sins only. The Apostle James also, knowing that the baptized can be tempted, and fall of their own free choice, says:[fn-66-P6630_2076919:40-nf] \"Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he hath been approved, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to them that love him.\" And that we may not think that we are tempted by God, as we read in Genesis Abraham was, he adds: \"Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, and He Himself tempteth no man. But each man is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lust and enticed. Then the lust, when it hath conceived, beareth sin: and the sin, when it is full grown, bringeth forth death.\" God created us with free will, and we are not forced by necessity either to virtue or to vice. Otherwise, if there be necessity, there is no crown. As n good works it is God who brings them to perfection, for it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that pitieth and gives us help that we may be able to reach the goal: so in things wicked and sinful, the seeds within us give the impulse, and these are brought to maturity by the devil. When he sees that we are building upon the foundation of Christ, hay, wood, stubble, then he applies the match. Let us then build gold, silver, costly stones, and he will not venture to tempt us: although even thus there is not sure and safe possession. For the lion lurks in ambush to slay the innocent.[fn-66-P6631_2078282:41-nf] \"Potters' vessels are proved by the furnace, and just men by the trial of tribulation.\" And in another place it is written:[fn-66-P6632_2078429:42-nf] \"My son, when thou comest to serve the Lord, prepare thyself for temptation.\" Again, the same James says:[fn-66-P6633_2078555:43-nf] \"Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only. For if any one is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror: for he beholdeth himself, and goeth away, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.\" It was useless to warn them to add works to faith, if they could not sin after baptism. He tells us that[fn-66-P6634_2078944:44-nf] \"whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is become guilty of all.\" Which of us is without sin?[fn-66-P6635_2079087:45-nf] \"God hath shut up all unto disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.\" Peter also says:[fn-66-P6636_2079199:46-nf] \"The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation.\" And concerning false teachers:[fn-66-P6637_2079310:47-nf] \"These are springs without water, and mists driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved. For, uttering proud wordsof vanity, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by lasciviousness, those who had just escaped, and have turned back to error.\" Does not the Apostle in these words seem to you to have depicted the new party of ignorance? For, as it were, they open the fountains of knowledge and yet have no water: they promise a shower of doctrine like prophetic clouds which have been visited by the truth of God, and are driven by the storms of devils and vices. They speak great things, and their talk is nothing but pride:[fn-66-P6638_2080000:48-nf] \"But every one is unclean with God who is lifted up in his own heart.\" Like those who had just escaped from their sins, they return to their own error, and persuade men to luxury, and to the delights of eating and the gratification of the flesh. For who is not glad to hear them say: \"Let us eat and drink, and reign for ever\"? The wise and prudent they call corrupt, but pay more attention to the honey-tongued. John the apostle, or rather the Saviour in the person of John, writes thus to the angel of the Church of Ephesus:[fn-66-P6639_2080552:49-nf] \"I know thy works and thy toil and patience, and that thou didst bear for my name's sake, and hast not grown weary. But I have this against thee, that thou didst leave thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come to thee, and will move thy candlestick out of its place, except thou repent.\" Similarly He urges the other churches, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, Laodicea, to repentance, and threatens them unless they return to the former works. And in Sardis He says He has a few who have not defiled their garments, and they shall walk with Him in white, for they are worthy. But they to whom He says: \"Remember from whence thou art fallen \"; and, \"Behold the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried\"; and, \"I know where thou dwellest, even where Satan's throne is\"; and, \"Remember how thou hast received, and didst hear, and keep it, and repent,\" and so on, were of course believers, and baptized, who once stood, but fell through sin.","title":"Book II.","author":false},{"chapter":6,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"81","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Thus far then the majesty of the Spirit is demonstrated by the evidence of our opponents, but in what follows the limpid waters of devotion are once more defiled by the mud of heresy. For he says of the Spirit that He \"cheers on those who are contending\": and this phrase involves him in the charge of extreme folly and impiety. For in the stadium some have the task of arranging the competitions between those who intend to show their athletic vigour; others, who surpass the rest in strength and skill, strive for the victory and strip to contend with one another, while the rest, taking sides in their good wishes with one or other of the competitors, according as they are severally disposed towards or interested in one athlete or another, cheer him on at the time of the engagement, and bid him guard against some hurt, or remember some trick of wrestling, or keep himself unthrown by the help of his art. Take note from what has been said to how low a rank Eunomius degrades the Holy Spirit. For while on the course there are some who arrange the contests, and others who settle whether the contest is conducted according to rule, others who are actually engaged, and yet others who cheer on the competitors, who are acknowledged to be far inferior to the athletes themselves, Eunomius considers the Holy Spirit as one of the mob who look on, or as one of those who attend upon the athletes, seeing that He neither determines the contest nor awards the victory, nor contends with the adversary, but merely cheers without contributing at all to the victory. For He neither joins in the fray, nor does He implant the power to contend, but merely wishes that the athlete in whom He is interested may not come off second in the strife. And so Paul wrestles \"against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places[fn-12-P1295_700178:272-nf] ,\" while the Spirit of power does not strengthen the combatants nor distribute to them His gifts, \"dividing to every man severally as He will[fn-12-P1296_700340:273-nf] ,\" but His influence is limited to cheering on those who are engaged.","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":6,"verse":18,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_21_viii_on_fasting_in_opposition_to_the_psychics_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"ANF-04","text":"In like manner they censure on the count of novelty our Stations as being enjoined; some, moreover, (censure them) too as being prolonged habitually too late, saying that this duty also ought to be observed of free choice, and not continued beyond the ninth hour,-(deriving their rule), of course, from their own practice.

The teaching of the apostles was surely in everything according to the mind of God: they forgot and omitted nothing of the Gospel. Where, then, do you show that they renewed the command to flee from city to city? In fact, it was utterly impossible that they should have laid down anything so utterly opposed to their own examples as a command to flee, while it was just from bonds, or the islands in which, for confessing, not fleeing from the Christian name, they were confined, they wrote their letters to the Churches. Paul[fn-19-P1974_594332:34-nf] bids us support the weak, but most certainly it is not when they flee. For how can the absent be supported by you? By bearing with them? Well, he says that people must be supported, if anywhere they have committed a fault through the weakness of their faith, just as (he enjoins) that we should comfort the faint-hearted; he does not say, however, that they should be sent into exile. But when he urges us not to give place to evil,[fn-19-P1975_594786:35-nf] he does not offer the suggestion that we should take to our heels, he only teaches that passion should be kept under restraint; and if he says that the time must be redeemed, because the days are evil,[fn-19-P1976_595006:36-nf] he wishes us to gain a lengthening of life, not by flight, but by wisdom. Besides, he who bids us shine as sons of light,[fn-19-P1977_595145:37-nf] does not bid us hide away out of sight as sons of darkness. He commands us to stand stedfast,[fn-19-P1978_595259:38-nf] certainly not to act an opposite. part by fleeing; and to be girt, not to play the fugitive or oppose the Gospel. He points out weapons, too, which persons who intend to run away would not require. And among these he notes the shield[fn-19-P1979_595513:39-nf] too, that ye may be able to quench the darts of the devil, when doubtless ye resist him, and sustain his assaults in their utmost force. Accordingly John also teaches that we must lay down our lives for the brethren;[fn-19-P1980_595748:40-nf] much more, then, we must do it for the Lord. This cannot be fulfilled by those who flee. Finally, mindful of his own Revelation, in which he had heard the doom of the fearful, (and so) speaking from personal knowledge, he warns us that fear must be put away. \"There is no fear,\" says he, \"in love; but perfect love casteth out fear; because fear has torment\"-the fire of the lake, no doubt. \"He that feareth is not perfect in love\"[fn-19-P1981_596201:41-nf] -to wit, the love of God. And yet who will flee from persecution, but he who fears? Who will fear, but he who has not loved? Yes; and if you ask counsel of the Spirit, what does He approve more than that utterance of the Spirit? For, indeed, it incites all almost to go and offer themselves in martyrdom, not to flee from it; so that we also make mention of it. If you are exposed to public infamy, says he, it is for your good; for he who is not exposed to dishonour among men is sure to be so before the Lord. Do not be ashamed; righteousness brings you forth into the public gaze. Why should you be ashamed of gaining glory? The opportunity is given you when you are before the eyes of men. So also elsewhere: seek not to die on bridal beds, nor in miscarriages, nor in soft fevers, but to die the martyr's death, that He may be glorified who has suffered for you.","title":"IX.

There are four emotions which agitate mankind, two relating to the present, two to the future; two to good, and two to evil. There is sorrow, called in Greek lu/ph, and joy, in Greek xara/ or h9donh/, although many translate the latter word by voluptas, pleasure; the one of which is referred to evil, the other to good. And we go too far if we rejoice over such things as we ought not, as, for example, riches, power, distinctions, the bad fortune of enemies, or their death; or, on the other hand, if we are tortured with grief on account of present evils, adversity, exile, poverty, weakness, and the death of kindred, all of which is forbidden by the Apostle. And again, if we covet those things which we consider good, inheritance, distinctions, unvaried prosperity, bodily health, and the like, in the possession of which we rejoice and find enjoyment; or if we fear those things which we deem adverse. Now, according to the Stoics, Zeno that is to say and Chrysippus, it is possible for a perfect man to be free from these emotions; according to the Peripatetics, it is difficult and even impossible, an opinion which has the constant support of all Scripture. Hence Josephus, the historian of the Maccabees, said that the emotions can be subdued and governed, not extirpated, and Cicero's five books of \"Tusculan Disputations\" are full of these discussions.[fn-75-P7534_2487868:2-nf] Accordto the Apostle, the weakness of the body and spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places fight against us.

See here, I pray you, how mildly Gamaliel reasons, and how he says but a few words to them, and does not recount ancient histories, although he might have done so, but more recent instances, which are most powerful to produce belief. With this view he throws out a hint himself, saying, \"For before. these days\" (v. 36): meaning, not many days before. Now had he at once said, \"Let these men go,\" both himself would have fallen into suspicion, and his speech would not have been so effective: but after the examples, it acquired its own proper force. And he mentions not one instance, but a second also: \"for,\" saith the Scripture, \"in the mouth of two witnesses\" (Matt. xviii. 16): and yet he had it in his power to mention even three. \"Refrain from these men.\" (v. 38.) See how mild his manner is, and his speech not long, but concise, and his mention even of those (impostors) how free from passion: \"And all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered.\" And[fn-6-P675_533550:6-nf] for all this he does not blaspheme Christ. They heard him, all these unbelievers, heard him, these Jews. [\"For if this council or this work be of men, it will come to naught.\"] Well then, since it did not come to nought, it is not of men. [\"But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it.\"] (v. 39.) Once more he checks them by the impossibility and the inexpediency of the thing, saying, \"Lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.\"[fn-6-P676_534552:7-nf] And he does not say, If Christ be God; but the work (itself) declares (this). He does not pronounce upon it, either that, it is \"of men,\" or that it is \"of God;\" but he leaves the proof to the future. \"They were persuaded [by him].\" (v. 40.) Then why, it may be asked, do ye scourge them? Such was the incontrovertible justness of his speech, they could not look it in the face; nevertheless, they sated their own animosity; and again they expected to terrify them in this way. By the fact also of his saying these things not in the presence of the Apostles, he gained a hearing more than he would otherwise have done; and then the suavity of his discourse and the justness of what was said, helped to persuade them. in fact, this man all but preached the Gospel. \"[fn-6-P677_536060:8-nf] Ye were persuaded,\" one may say, \"that ye had not strength to overthrow it. Wherefore did ye not believe?\" Such is the witness borne even by enemies. There it is four hundred, there, four thousand: and here the first movers were twelve. Let not the number which added itself affright you. (ch. ii. 41; iv. 4.) He might also have mentioned another instance, that of the Egyptian, but what he has spoken is fully sufficient. And he closes his speech with an alarming topic: \"Lest haply,\" etc. And he does not pronounce upon it, lest he should seem to be pleading their cause; but he reasons by way of syllogism froth the issue of the matter. And he does not venture to pronounce that it is not of men, nor yet that it is of God; for bad he said that it was of God. they would have gainsaid him: but had he said that it was of men, they would again have taken prompt measures. Therefore he bids them wait for the end, saying, \"Refrain,\" But they once more threaten knowing indeed that they avail nothing, but doing after their manner. Such is the nature of wickedness: it attempts even impossibilities.-\"And after this man rose up Judas,\" etc. These things Josephus relates in detail. (Ant. xx. 8; ib. v. 2; xviii. 1. B. J. ii. 8. 1.) But what a great thing it was that he ventured to affirm: that it was of God, when in the sequel it received its proof from the events! Great boldness of speech, great freedom from all respect of persons![fn-6-P678_538091:9-nf] And he does not say, \"But if ye do not overthrow it, it is of God;\" but, \"If it be of God, it will not be overthrown.\" \"And to him they agreed.\" (v. 40.) They reverenced the high character of the man. \"And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Christ.\" (v. 41.) What miracles so wonderful as this? Nowhere is the like of this recorded of the old saints: for Jeremiah indeed was scourged for the word of God, and they threatened Elijah, and the rest: but in this case, even by this very thing, and not only by their miracles, these showed forth the power of God. He does not say, that they were not pained, but that though pained they rejoiced. How does this appear? From their boldness afterwards: they were so instant still, even after their beatings, in preaching the word. \"But in the temple,\" it says, \"and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.\" (v. 42.) \"And in those days \"-when these things were done, when there were scourgings, when there were threatenings, when the disciples were multiplying-also, it says, \"there arose a murmuring.\" (ch. vi. 1.) And this comes of the multitude: for it is impossible to have strict order in a multitude. \"There arose a murmuring,\"etc. to,-\"And[fn-6-P679_539639:10-nf] a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.-There arose murmuring against the Hebrews \"-for that description of people seemed to be more honorable-\" because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.\"[fn-6-P680_540664:11-nf] (v. 1-7.) So then there was a daily ministration for the widows. And observe how he calls it a \"ministration\" (diakonia), and not directly alms: extolling by this at once the doers, and those to whom it was done. \"Were neglected.\" This did not arise from malice, but perhaps from the carelessness of the multitude. And therefore he brought it forward openly, for this was no small evil. Observe, how even in the beginning the evils came not only from without, but also from within. For you must not look to this only, that it was set to rights, but observe that it was a great evil that it existed.[fn-6-P681_541655:12-nf] \"Then the twelve,\" etc. (v. 2.) Do you observe[fn-6-P682_542527:13-nf] how outward concerns succeed to inward? They do not act at their own discretion, but plead for themselves to the congregation. So ought it to be done now. \"It is not reason,\" says he, \"that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.\" First he puts to them the unreasonableness of the thing; that it is not possible for both things to be done with the same attention: just as when they were about to ordain Matthias, they first show the necessity of the thing, that one was deficient, and there must needs be twelve. And so here they showed the necessity; and they did it not sooner, but waited till the murmuring arose; nor, on the other hand, did they suffer this to spread far. And, lo! they leave the decision to them: those who pleased all, those who of all were honestly reputed, them they present:[fn-6-P683_543553:14-nf] not now twelve, but \"seven, full of the Spirit and of wisdom: well reported of\" for their conversation. (v. 3.) Now when Matthias was to be presented, it was said, \"Therefore must one of these men which have companied with us all the time\" (ch. i. 21): but not so here: for the case was not alike. And they do not now put it to the lot; they might indeed themselves have made the election, as moved by the Spirit: but nevertheless, they desire the testimony of the people. The fixing the number, and the ordaining them, and for this kind of business, rested with them: but the choice of the men they make over to the people, that they might not seem to act from favor: just as God also leaves it to Moses to choose as elders those whom he knew. (Num. xi. 16.) \"And of wisdom.\" For indeed there needs much wisdom in such ministrations. For think not, because he hath not the word committed unto him, that such an one has no need of wisdom: he does need it, and much too. \"But we,\" saith he, \"will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.\" (v. 4.) Again they plead for themselves, beginning and ending with this. \"Will give ourselves continually,\" he saith. For so it behooved, not just to do the mere acts, or in any chance way, but to be continually doing them. \"And the saying,\" we are told, \"pleased the whole multitude.\" (v. 5, 6.) This too was worthy of their wisdom. All approved of what was said so sensible was it. \"And they chose,\" it says (again it is the people (autoi) that choose,) \"Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch: whom they set before the Apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.\" They separated them from the multitude, and it is the people (autoi) that draw them, not the Apostles that lead them. Observe how he avoids all that is superfluous: he does not tell in what way it was done, but that they were ordained (exeirotonhqhsan) with prayer: for this is the meaning of xeirotonia, (i.e. \"putting forth the hand,\") or ordination: the hand of the man is laid upon (the person,) but the whole work is of God, and it is His hand which toucheth the head of the one ordained, if he be duly ordained. \"And the word of God,\" it says, \"increased: and the number of the disciples multiplied.\" (v. 7.) It is not for nothing that he says this: it shows how great is the virtue of alms and good order. And as he is about in the sequel to enlarge (aucein) upon the affair of Stephen, he puts first the causes which led to it. \"And many,\" he says, \"of the priests were obedient to the faith.\" For[fn-6-P684_546413:15-nf] since they perceived such to be the mind of their ruler and teacher, they put the matter to the test of facts.-It is also a subject for wonder, how it was that the multitude was not divided in its choice of the men, and how it was that the Apostles were not rejected by them. But what sort of rank these bore, and what sort of office they received, this is what we need to learn. Was it that of Deacons? And yet this is not the case in the Churches. But[fn-6-P685_547436:16-nf] is it to the Presbyters that the management belongs? And yet at present there was no Bishop, but the Apostles only. Whence I think it clearly and manifestily follows, that neither Deacons nor Presbyters is their designation: but it was for this particular purpose that they were ordained.[fn-6-P686_551764:17-nf] And this business was not simply handed over to them without further ceremony, but the Apostles prayed over them, that power might be given to them. But observe, I pray you, if there were need of seven men for this, great in proportion must have been the sums of money that flowed in, great in proportion also the number of widows. So then the prayers were not made in an off-hand way, but with much deliberate attention: and this office,[fn-6-P687_552972:18-nf] as well as preaching, was thus brought to good effect; for what they did, they effected mostly by the means of these (their prayers.) Thus they were enabled to give their attention to things spiritual; thus were these also free to undertake long journeys; thus were these put in trust with the word. But the writer does not say this, nor extol them, but that it was \"not reason\" that they should leave the work given to them. Thus they had been taught by Moses's example not to undertake the management of everything by themselves. (Num. xi. 14.) \"Only,\" it is said, \"that we should remember the poor.\" (Gal. ii. 10.) And[fn-6-P688_554824:19-nf] how did they bring these forward? They fasted. \"Look you out seven men,\" etc. (v. 3.) It is not simply, spiritual men, but, \"full of the Spirit and of wisdom, \"for it needed very great superiority of mind (filosofiaj) to bear the complainings of widows. For what profits it, that the dispenser of alms steal not, if nevertheless he waste all, or be harsh and easily provoked? \"And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost.\" (v. 5.) And in this regard Philip also was admirable: for it is of him that the writer says: \"And we entered into the house of Philip the Evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him.\"-(ch. xxi. 8.) Dost thou mark how matters are ordered quite otherwise than after the matter of men? \"And the number of disciples was multiplied in Jerusalem.\" (v. 7.) In Jerusalem the multitude increased. Wonderful, where Christ was slain, there the preaching increased! And not only was it not the case that some were offended then in the manner of Ananias, but the awe became even greater: while these are scourged, those threatening, those tempting the Spirit, those murmuring. But I would have thee remark under what circumstances the multitude increased: after these trials, then it was that the multitude increased, and not before. Mark also how great the mercy of God. Of those chief-priests, of the very men who had indignation and sore displeasure and so cried out and said, \"He saved others, Himself He cannot save;\" of these same,\" Many,\" it says, \"were obedient unto the faith.\" (Matt. xxvii. 42.)

See here, I pray you, how mildly Gamaliel reasons, and how he says but a few words to them, and does not recount ancient histories, although he might have done so, but more recent instances, which are most powerful to produce belief. With this view he throws out a hint himself, saying, \"For before. these days\" (v. 36): meaning, not many days before. Now had he at once said, \"Let these men go,\" both himself would have fallen into suspicion, and his speech would not have been so effective: but after the examples, it acquired its own proper force. And he mentions not one instance, but a second also: \"for,\" saith the Scripture, \"in the mouth of two witnesses\" (Matt. xviii. 16): and yet he had it in his power to mention even three. \"Refrain from these men.\" (v. 38.) See how mild his manner is, and his speech not long, but concise, and his mention even of those (impostors) how free from passion: \"And all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered.\" And[fn-6-P675_533550:6-nf] for all this he does not blaspheme Christ. They heard him, all these unbelievers, heard him, these Jews. [\"For if this council or this work be of men, it will come to naught.\"] Well then, since it did not come to nought, it is not of men. [\"But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it.\"] (v. 39.) Once more he checks them by the impossibility and the inexpediency of the thing, saying, \"Lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.\"[fn-6-P676_534552:7-nf] And he does not say, If Christ be God; but the work (itself) declares (this). He does not pronounce upon it, either that, it is \"of men,\" or that it is \"of God;\" but he leaves the proof to the future. \"They were persuaded [by him].\" (v. 40.) Then why, it may be asked, do ye scourge them? Such was the incontrovertible justness of his speech, they could not look it in the face; nevertheless, they sated their own animosity; and again they expected to terrify them in this way. By the fact also of his saying these things not in the presence of the Apostles, he gained a hearing more than he would otherwise have done; and then the suavity of his discourse and the justness of what was said, helped to persuade them. in fact, this man all but preached the Gospel. \"[fn-6-P677_536060:8-nf] Ye were persuaded,\" one may say, \"that ye had not strength to overthrow it. Wherefore did ye not believe?\" Such is the witness borne even by enemies. There it is four hundred, there, four thousand: and here the first movers were twelve. Let not the number which added itself affright you. (ch. ii. 41; iv. 4.) He might also have mentioned another instance, that of the Egyptian, but what he has spoken is fully sufficient. And he closes his speech with an alarming topic: \"Lest haply,\" etc. And he does not pronounce upon it, lest he should seem to be pleading their cause; but he reasons by way of syllogism froth the issue of the matter. And he does not venture to pronounce that it is not of men, nor yet that it is of God; for bad he said that it was of God. they would have gainsaid him: but had he said that it was of men, they would again have taken prompt measures. Therefore he bids them wait for the end, saying, \"Refrain,\" But they once more threaten knowing indeed that they avail nothing, but doing after their manner. Such is the nature of wickedness: it attempts even impossibilities.-\"And after this man rose up Judas,\" etc. These things Josephus relates in detail. (Ant. xx. 8; ib. v. 2; xviii. 1. B. J. ii. 8. 1.) But what a great thing it was that he ventured to affirm: that it was of God, when in the sequel it received its proof from the events! Great boldness of speech, great freedom from all respect of persons![fn-6-P678_538091:9-nf] And he does not say, \"But if ye do not overthrow it, it is of God;\" but, \"If it be of God, it will not be overthrown.\" \"And to him they agreed.\" (v. 40.) They reverenced the high character of the man. \"And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Christ.\" (v. 41.) What miracles so wonderful as this? Nowhere is the like of this recorded of the old saints: for Jeremiah indeed was scourged for the word of God, and they threatened Elijah, and the rest: but in this case, even by this very thing, and not only by their miracles, these showed forth the power of God. He does not say, that they were not pained, but that though pained they rejoiced. How does this appear? From their boldness afterwards: they were so instant still, even after their beatings, in preaching the word. \"But in the temple,\" it says, \"and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.\" (v. 42.) \"And in those days \"-when these things were done, when there were scourgings, when there were threatenings, when the disciples were multiplying-also, it says, \"there arose a murmuring.\" (ch. vi. 1.) And this comes of the multitude: for it is impossible to have strict order in a multitude. \"There arose a murmuring,\"etc. to,-\"And[fn-6-P679_539639:10-nf] a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.-There arose murmuring against the Hebrews \"-for that description of people seemed to be more honorable-\" because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.\"[fn-6-P680_540664:11-nf] (v. 1-7.) So then there was a daily ministration for the widows. And observe how he calls it a \"ministration\" (diakonia), and not directly alms: extolling by this at once the doers, and those to whom it was done. \"Were neglected.\" This did not arise from malice, but perhaps from the carelessness of the multitude. And therefore he brought it forward openly, for this was no small evil. Observe, how even in the beginning the evils came not only from without, but also from within. For you must not look to this only, that it was set to rights, but observe that it was a great evil that it existed.[fn-6-P681_541655:12-nf] \"Then the twelve,\" etc. (v. 2.) Do you observe[fn-6-P682_542527:13-nf] how outward concerns succeed to inward? They do not act at their own discretion, but plead for themselves to the congregation. So ought it to be done now. \"It is not reason,\" says he, \"that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.\" First he puts to them the unreasonableness of the thing; that it is not possible for both things to be done with the same attention: just as when they were about to ordain Matthias, they first show the necessity of the thing, that one was deficient, and there must needs be twelve. And so here they showed the necessity; and they did it not sooner, but waited till the murmuring arose; nor, on the other hand, did they suffer this to spread far. And, lo! they leave the decision to them: those who pleased all, those who of all were honestly reputed, them they present:[fn-6-P683_543553:14-nf] not now twelve, but \"seven, full of the Spirit and of wisdom: well reported of\" for their conversation. (v. 3.) Now when Matthias was to be presented, it was said, \"Therefore must one of these men which have companied with us all the time\" (ch. i. 21): but not so here: for the case was not alike. And they do not now put it to the lot; they might indeed themselves have made the election, as moved by the Spirit: but nevertheless, they desire the testimony of the people. The fixing the number, and the ordaining them, and for this kind of business, rested with them: but the choice of the men they make over to the people, that they might not seem to act from favor: just as God also leaves it to Moses to choose as elders those whom he knew. (Num. xi. 16.) \"And of wisdom.\" For indeed there needs much wisdom in such ministrations. For think not, because he hath not the word committed unto him, that such an one has no need of wisdom: he does need it, and much too. \"But we,\" saith he, \"will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.\" (v. 4.) Again they plead for themselves, beginning and ending with this. \"Will give ourselves continually,\" he saith.

And not only was it not the case that some were offended then in the manner of Ananias, but the awe became even greater: while these are scourged, those threatening, those tempting the Spirit, those murmuring. But I would have thee remark under what circumstances the multitude increased: after these trials, then it was that the multitude increased, and not before. Mark also how great the mercy of God.

See here, I pray you, how mildly Gamaliel reasons, and how he says but a few words to them, and does not recount ancient histories, although he might have done so, but more recent instances, which are most powerful to produce belief. With this view he throws out a hint himself, saying, \"For before. these days\" (v. 36): meaning, not many days before. Now had he at once said, \"Let these men go,\" both himself would have fallen into suspicion, and his speech would not have been so effective: but after the examples, it acquired its own proper force. And he mentions not one instance, but a second also: \"for,\" saith the Scripture, \"in the mouth of two witnesses\" (Matt. xviii. 16): and yet he had it in his power to mention even three. \"Refrain from these men.\" (v. 38.) See how mild his manner is, and his speech not long, but concise, and his mention even of those (impostors) how free from passion: \"And all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered.\" And[fn-6-P675_533550:6-nf] for all this he does not blaspheme Christ.

Once more he checks them by the impossibility and the inexpediency of the thing, saying, \"Lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.\"[fn-6-P676_534552:7-nf] And he does not say, If Christ be God; but the work (itself) declares (this). He does not pronounce upon it, either that, it is \"of men,\" or that it is \"of God;\" but he leaves the proof to the future. \"They were persuaded [by him].\" (v. 40.) Then why, it may be asked, do ye scourge them? Such was the incontrovertible justness of his speech, they could not look it in the face; nevertheless, they sated their own animosity; and again they expected to terrify them in this way. By the fact also of his saying these things not in the presence of the Apostles, he gained a hearing more than he would otherwise have done; and then the suavity of his discourse and the justness of what was said, helped to persuade them. in fact, this man all but preached the Gospel. \"[fn-6-P677_536060:8-nf] Ye were persuaded,\" one may say, \"that ye had not strength to overthrow it. Wherefore did ye not believe?\" Such is the witness borne even by enemies. There it is four hundred, there, four thousand: and here the first movers were twelve. Let not the number which added itself affright you. (ch. ii. 41; iv. 4.) He might also have mentioned another instance, that of the Egyptian, but what he has spoken is fully sufficient. And he closes his speech with an alarming topic: \"Lest haply,\" etc. And he does not pronounce upon it, lest he should seem to be pleading their cause; but he reasons by way of syllogism froth the issue of the matter. And he does not venture to pronounce that it is not of men, nor yet that it is of God; for bad he said that it was of God. they would have gainsaid him: but had he said that it was of men, they would again have taken prompt measures. Therefore he bids them wait for the end, saying, \"Refrain,\" But they once more threaten knowing indeed that they avail nothing, but doing after their manner. Such is the nature of wickedness: it attempts even impossibilities.-\"And after this man rose up Judas,\" etc. These things Josephus relates in detail. (Ant. xx. 8; ib. v. 2; xviii. 1. B. J. ii. 8. 1.) But what a great thing it was that he ventured to affirm: that it was of God, when in the sequel it received its proof from the events! Great boldness of speech, great freedom from all respect of persons![fn-6-P678_538091:9-nf] And he does not say, \"But if ye do not overthrow it, it is of God;\" but, \"If it be of God, it will not be overthrown.\" \"And to him they agreed.\" (v. 40.) They reverenced the high character of the man. \"And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Christ.\" (v. 41.) What miracles so wonderful as this? Nowhere is the like of this recorded of the old saints: for Jeremiah indeed was scourged for the word of God, and they threatened Elijah, and the rest: but in this case, even by this very thing, and not only by their miracles, these showed forth the power of God. He does not say, that they were not pained, but that though pained they rejoiced. How does this appear? From their boldness afterwards: they were so instant still, even after their beatings, in preaching the word. \"But in the temple,\" it says, \"and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.\" (v. 42.) \"And in those days \"-when these things were done, when there were scourgings, when there were threatenings, when the disciples were multiplying-also, it says, \"there arose a murmuring.\" (ch. vi. 1.) And this comes of the multitude: for it is impossible to have strict order in a multitude. \"There arose a murmuring,\"etc. to,-\"And[fn-6-P679_539639:10-nf] a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.-There arose murmuring against the Hebrews \"-for that description of people seemed to be more honorable-\" because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.\"[fn-6-P680_540664:11-nf] (v. 1-7.) So then there was a daily ministration for the widows. And observe how he calls it a \"ministration\" (diakonia), and not directly alms: extolling by this at once the doers, and those to whom it was done. \"Were neglected.\" This did not arise from malice, but perhaps from the carelessness of the multitude. And therefore he brought it forward openly, for this was no small evil. Observe, how even in the beginning the evils came not only from without, but also from within. For you must not look to this only, that it was set to rights, but observe that it was a great evil that it existed.[fn-6-P681_541655:12-nf] \"Then the twelve,\" etc. (v. 2.) Do you observe[fn-6-P682_542527:13-nf] how outward concerns succeed to inward? They do not act at their own discretion, but plead for themselves to the congregation. So ought it to be done now. \"It is not reason,\" says he, \"that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.\" First he puts to them the unreasonableness of the thing; that it is not possible for both things to be done with the same attention: just as when they were about to ordain Matthias, they first show the necessity of the thing, that one was deficient, and there must needs be twelve. And so here they showed the necessity; and they did it not sooner, but waited till the murmuring arose; nor, on the other hand, did they suffer this to spread far. And, lo! they leave the decision to them: those who pleased all, those who of all were honestly reputed, them they present:[fn-6-P683_543553:14-nf] not now twelve, but \"seven, full of the Spirit and of wisdom: well reported of\" for their conversation. (v. 3.) Now when Matthias was to be presented, it was said, \"Therefore must one of these men which have companied with us all the time\" (ch. i. 21): but not so here: for the case was not alike. And they do not now put it to the lot; they might indeed themselves have made the election, as moved by the Spirit: but nevertheless, they desire the testimony of the people. The fixing the number, and the ordaining them, and for this kind of business, rested with them: but the choice of the men they make over to the people, that they might not seem to act from favor: just as God also leaves it to Moses to choose as elders those whom he knew. (Num. xi. 16.) \"And of wisdom.\" For indeed there needs much wisdom in such ministrations. For think not, because he hath not the word committed unto him, that such an one has no need of wisdom: he does need it, and much too. \"But we,\" saith he, \"will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.\" (v. 4.) Again they plead for themselves, beginning and ending with this. \"Will give ourselves continually,\" he saith. For so it behooved, not just to do the mere acts, or in any chance way, but to be continually doing them. \"And the saying,\" we are told, \"pleased the whole multitude.\" (v. 5, 6.) This too was worthy of their wisdom. All approved of what was said so sensible was it. \"And they chose,\" it says (again it is the people (autoi) that choose,) \"Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch: whom they set before the Apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.\" They separated them from the multitude, and it is the people (autoi) that draw them, not the Apostles that lead them. Observe how he avoids all that is superfluous: he does not tell in what way it was done, but that they were ordained (exeirotonhqhsan) with prayer: for this is the meaning of xeirotonia, (i.e. \"putting forth the hand,\") or ordination: the hand of the man is laid upon (the person,) but the whole work is of God, and it is His hand which toucheth the head of the one ordained, if he be duly ordained. \"And the word of God,\" it says, \"increased: and the number of the disciples multiplied.\" (v. 7.) It is not for nothing that he says this: it shows how great is the virtue of alms and good order. And as he is about in the sequel to enlarge (aucein) upon the affair of Stephen, he puts first the causes which led to it. \"And many,\" he says, \"of the priests were obedient to the faith.\" For[fn-6-P684_546413:15-nf] since they perceived such to be the mind of their ruler and teacher, they put the matter to the test of facts.-It is also a subject for wonder, how it was that the multitude was not divided in its choice of the men, and how it was that the Apostles were not rejected by them. But what sort of rank these bore, and what sort of office they received, this is what we need to learn. Was it that of Deacons? And yet this is not the case in the Churches. But[fn-6-P685_547436:16-nf] is it to the Presbyters that the management belongs? And yet at present there was no Bishop, but the Apostles only. Whence I think it clearly and manifestily follows, that neither Deacons nor Presbyters is their designation: but it was for this particular purpose that they were ordained.[fn-6-P686_551764:17-nf] And this business was not simply handed over to them without further ceremony, but the Apostles prayed over them, that power might be given to them. But observe, I pray you, if there were need of seven men for this, great in proportion must have been the sums of money that flowed in, great in proportion also the number of widows. So then the prayers were not made in an off-hand way, but with much deliberate attention: and this office,[fn-6-P687_552972:18-nf] as well as preaching, was thus brought to good effect; for what they did, they effected mostly by the means of these (their prayers.) Thus they were enabled to give their attention to things spiritual; thus were these also free to undertake long journeys; thus were these put in trust with the word. But the writer does not say this, nor extol them, but that it was \"not reason\" that they should leave the work given to them.

For that city[fn-30-P3012_1409674:120-nf] was brought into captivity, and a large section of the people were carried off into Babylonia. Now, as Jerusalem signifies the city and fellowship of the saints, so Babylonia signifies the city and fellowship of the wicked, seeing that by interpretation it denotes confusion. On the subject of these two cities, which have been running their courses, mingling the one with the other, through all the changes of time from the beginning of the human race, and which shall so move on together until the end of the world, when they are destined to be separated at the last judgment, we have spoken already a little ago.[fn-30-P3013_1410323:121-nf] That captivity, then, of the city of Jerusalem, and the people thus carried into Babylonia in bondage, were ordained so to proceed by the Lord, by the voice of Jeremiah, a prophet of that time.[fn-30-P3014_1410542:122-nf] And there appeared kings[fn-30-P3015_1410598:123-nf] of Babylon, under whom they were in slavery, who on occasion of the captivity of this people were so wrought upon by certain miracles that they came to know the one true God who rounded universal creation, and worshipped Him, and commanded that He should be worshipped. Moreover the people were ordered both to pray for those by whom they were detained in captivity, and in their peace to hope for peace, to the effect that they should beget children, and build houses, and plant gardens and vineyards.[fn-30-P3016_1411162:124-nf] But at the end of seventy years, release from their captivity was promised to them.[fn-30-P3017_1411268:125-nf] All this, furthermore, signified in a figure that the Church of Christ in all His saints, who are citizens of the heavenly Jerusalem, would have to do service under the kings of this world. For the doctrine of the apostles speaks also in this wise, that 'every soul should be subject to the higher powers,' and that there 'should be rendered all things to all men, tribute to whom tribute (is due), custom to whom custom,'[fn-30-P3018_1411712:126-nf] and all other things in like manner which, without detriment to the worship of our God, we render to the rulers in the constitution of human society: for the Lord Himself also, in order to set before us an example of this sound doctrine, did not deem it unworthy of Him to pay tribute[fn-30-P3019_1412021:127-nf] on account of that human individuality[fn-30-P3020_1412083:128-nf] wherewith He was invested. Again, Christian servants and good believers are also commanded to serve their temporal masters in equanimity and faithfulness;[fn-30-P3021_1412315:129-nf] whom they will hereafter judge, if even on to the end they find them wicked, or with whom they will hereafter reign in equality, if they too shall have been converted to the true God. Still all are enjoined to be subject to the powers that are of man and of earth, even until, at the end of the predetermined time which the seventy years signify, the Church shall be delivered from the confusion of this world, like as Jerusalem was to be set free from the captivity in Babylonia. By occasion of that captivity, however, the kings of earth too have themselves been led to forsake the idols on account of which they were wont to persecute the Christians, and have come to know, and now worship, the one true God and Christ the Lord; and it is on their behalf that the Apostle Paul enjoins prayer to be made, even although they should persecute the Church. For he speaks in these terms: 'I entreat, therefore, that first of all supplications, adorations,[fn-30-P3022_1413287:130-nf] intercessions, and givings of thanks be made for kings, for all men, and all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, with all godliness and charity.\"[fn-30-P3023_1413543:131-nf] Accordingly peace has been given to the Church by these same persons, although it be but of a temporal sort,-a temporal quiet for the work of building houses after a spiritual fashion, and planting gardens and vineyards. For witness your own case, too,-at this very time we are engaged, by means of this discourse, in building you up and planting you. And the like process is going on throughout the whole circle of lands, in virtue of the peace allowed by Christian kings, even as the same apostle thus expresses himself: 'Ye are God's husbandry; ye are God's building.'[fn-30-P3024_1414139:132-nf] ","title":"Introductory Notice.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_29_the_epistle_of_ignatius_to_the_antiochians","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"35","folder":"ANF-01","text":"Let the husbands love their wives, remembering that, at the creation, one woman, and not many, was given to one man.

Let us see, therefore, whether that is not some other sword, which has so different an action. Now the Apostle John, in the Apocalypse, describes a sword which proceeded from the mouth of God as \"a doubly sharp, two-edged one.\"[fn-50-P5007_1578509:199-nf] This may be understood to be the Divine Word, who is doubly edged with the two testaments of the law and the gospel-sharpened with wisdom, hostile to the devil, arming us against the spiritual enemies of all wickedness and concupiscence, and cutting us off from the dearest objects for the sake of God's holy name. If, however, you will not acknowledge John, you have our common master Paul, who \"girds our loins about with truth, and puts on us the breastplate of righteousness, and shoes us with the preparation of the gospel of peace, not of war; who bids us take the shield of faith, wherewith we may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the devil, and the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which (he says) is the word of God.\"[fn-50-P5008_1579280:200-nf] This sword the Lord Himself came to send on earth, and not peace.[fn-50-P5009_1579369:201-nf] If he is your Christ, then even he is a warrior. If he is not a warrior, and the sword he brandishes is an allegorical one, then the Creator's Christ in the psalm too may have been girded with the figurative sword of the Word, without any martial gear. The above-mentioned \"fairness\" of His beauty and \"grace of His lips\" would quite suit such a sword, girt as it even then was upon His thigh in the passage of David, and sent as it would one day be by Him on earth. For this is what He says: \"Ride on prosperously in Thy majesty[fn-50-P5010_1579919:202-nf] \"-advancing His word into every land, so as to call all nations: destined to prosper in the success of that faith which received Him, and reigning, from the fact that[fn-50-P5011_1580128:203-nf] He conquered death by His resurrection. \"Thy right hand,\" says He, \"shall wonderfully lead Thee forth,\"[fn-50-P5012_1580251:204-nf] even the might of Thy spiritual grace, whereby the knowledge of Christ is spread. \"Thine arrows are sharp; \"[fn-50-P5013_1580392:205-nf] everywhere Thy precepts fly about, Thy threatenings also, and convictions[fn-50-P5014_1580485:206-nf] of heart, pricking and piercing each conscience. \"The people shall fall under Thee,\"[fn-50-P5015_1580591:207-nf] that is, in adoration. Thus is the Creator's Christ mighty in war, and a bearer of arms; thus also does He now take the spoils, not of Samaria alone, but of all nations. Acknowledge, then, that His spoils are figurative, since you have learned that His arms are allegorical. Since, therefore, both the Lord speaks and His apostle writes such things[fn-50-P5016_1580959:208-nf] in a figurative style, we are not rash in using His interpretations, the records[fn-50-P5017_1581057:209-nf] of which even our adversaries admit; and thus in so far will it be Isaiah's Christ who has come, in as far as He was not a warrior, because it is not of such a character that He is described by Isaiah.","title":"Book III.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_23_letters_of_the_blessed_theodoret_bishop_of_cyrus","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"157","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"We have enjoyed the wonted blessings of the Feast.

The apostle declares that to himself, \"less than the least of all saints, was the grace given\" of enlightening all men as to \"what was the fellowship of the mystery, which during the ages had been hid in God, who created all things.\"[fn-80-P8009_2279216:811-nf] The heretic erased the preposition in, and made the clause run thus: (\"what is the fellowship of the mystery) which hath for ages been hidden from the God who created all things.\"[fn-80-P8010_2279419:812-nf] The falsification, however, is flagrantly[fn-80-P8011_2280020:813-nf] absurd. For the apostle goes on to infer (from his own statement): \"in order that unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might become known through the church the manifold wisdom of God.\"[fn-80-P8012_2280238:814-nf] Whose principalities and powers does he mean? If the Creator's, how does it come to pass that such a God as He could have meant His wisdom to be displayed to the principalities and powers, but not to Himself? For surely no principalities could possibly have understood anything without their sovereign Lord. Or if (the apostle) did not mention God in this passage, on the ground that He (as their chief) is Himself reckoned among these (principalities), then he would have plainly said that the mystery had been hidden from the principalities and powers of Him who had created all things, including Him amongst them. But if he states that it was hidden from them, he must needs be understood[fn-80-P8013_2280952:815-nf] as having meant that it was manifest to Him. From God, therefore, the mystery was not hidden; but it was hidden in God, the Creator of all things, from His principalities and powers. For \"who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been His counsellor? \"[fn-80-P8014_2281228:816-nf] Caught in this trap, the heretic probably changed the passage, with the view of saying that his god wished to make known to his principalities and powers the fellowship of his own mystery, of which God, who created all things, had been ignorant. But what was the use of his obtruding this ignorance of the Creator, who was a stranger to the superior god,[fn-80-P8015_2281603:817-nf] and far enough removed from him, when even his own servants had known nothing about him? To the Creator, however, the future was well known. Then why was not that also known to Him, which had to be revealed beneath His heaven, and on His earth? From this, therefore, there arises a confirmation of what we have already laid down. For since the Creator was sure to know, some time or other, that hidden mystery of the superior god, even on the supposition that the true reading was (as Marcion has it)-\"hidden from the God who created all things\"-he ought then to have expressed the conclusion thus: \"in order that the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to Him, and then to the principalities and powers of God, whosoever He might be, with whom the Creator was destined to share their knowledge.\" So palpable is the erasure in this passage, when thus read, consistently with its own true bearing. I, on my part, now wish to engage with you in a discussion on the allegorical expressions of the apostle. What figures of speech could the novel god have found in the prophets (fit for himself)? \"He led captivity captive,\" says the apostle.[fn-80-P8016_2282781:818-nf] With what arms? In what conflicts? From the devastation of what Country? From the overthrow of what city? What women, what children, what princes did the Conqueror throw into chains? For when by David Christ is sung as \"girded with His sword upon His thigh,\"[fn-80-P8017_2283078:819-nf] or by Isaiah as \"taking away the spoils of Samaria and the power of Damascus,\"[fn-80-P8018_2283176:820-nf] you make Him out to be[fn-80-P8019_2283220:821-nf] really and truly a warrior confest to the eye.[fn-80-P8020_2283284:822-nf] Learn then now, that His is a spiritual armour and warfare, since you have already discovered that the captivity is spiritual, in order that you may further learn that this also belongs to Him, even because the apostle derived the mention of the captivity from the same prophets as suggested to him his precepts likewise: \"Putting away lying,\" (says he, ) \"speak every man truth with his neighbour; \"[fn-80-P8021_2283742:823-nf] and again, using the very words in which the Psalm[fn-80-P8022_2283813:824-nf] expresses his meaning, (he says, ) \"Be ye angry, and sin not; \"[fn-80-P8023_2283895:825-nf] \"Let not the sun go down upon your wrath.\"[fn-80-P8024_2283958:826-nf] \"Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness; \"[fn-80-P8025_2284039:827-nf] for (in the Psalm it is written, ) \"With the holy man thou shalt be holy, and with the perverse thou shalt be perverse; \"[fn-80-P8026_2284180:828-nf] and, \"Thou shalt put away evil from among you.\"[fn-80-P8027_2284250:829-nf] Again, \"Go ye out from the midst of them; touch not the unclean thing; separate yourselves, ye that bear the vessels of the Lord.\"[fn-80-P8028_2284432:830-nf] (The apostle says further: ) \"Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess,\"[fn-80-P8029_2284552:831-nf] -a precept which is suggested by the passage (of the prophet), where the seducers of the consecrated (Nazarites) to drunkenness are rebuked: \"Ye gave wine to my holy ones to drink.\"[fn-80-P8030_2284753:832-nf] This prohibition from drink was given also to the high priest Aaron and his sons, \"when they went into the holy place.\"[fn-80-P8031_2284894:833-nf] The command, to \"sing to the Lord with psalms and hymns,\"[fn-80-P8032_2284970:834-nf] comes suitably from him who knew that those who \"drank wine with drums and psalteries\" were blamed by God.[fn-80-P8033_2285096:835-nf] Now, when I find to what God belong these precepts, whether in their germ or their development, I have no difficulty in knowing to whom the apostle also belongs. But he declares that \"wives ought to be in subjection to their husbands: \"[fn-80-P8034_2285357:836-nf] what reason does he give for this? \"Because,\" says he, \"the husband is the head of the wife.\"[fn-80-P8035_2285474:837-nf] Pray tell me, Marcion, does your god build up the authority of his law on the work of the Creator? This, however, is a comparative trifle; for he actually derives from the same source the condition of his Christ and his Church; for he says: \"even as Christ is the head of the Church; \"[fn-80-P8036_2285779:838-nf] and again, in like manner: \"He who loveth his wife, loveth his own flesh, even as Christ loved the Church.\"[fn-80-P8037_2285906:839-nf] You see how your Christ and your Church are put in comparison with the work of the Creator. How much honour is given to the flesh in the name of the church! \"No man,\" says the apostle, \"ever yet hated his own flesh\" (except, of course, Marcion alone), \"but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord doth the Church.\"[fn-80-P8038_2286251:840-nf] But you are the only man that hates his flesh, for you rob it of its resurrection. It will be only right that you should hate the Church also, because it is loved by Christ on the same principle.[fn-80-P8039_2286466:841-nf] Yea, Christ loved the flesh even as the Church. For no man will love the picture of his wife without taking care of it, and honouring it and crowning it. The likeness partakes with the reality in the privileged honour. I shall now endeavour, from my point of view,[fn-80-P8040_2286747:842-nf] to prove that the same God is (the God) of the man[fn-80-P8041_2286810:843-nf] and of Christ, of the woman and of the Church, of the flesh and the spirit, by the apostle's help who applies the Creator's injunction, and adds even a comment on it: \"For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother, (and shall be joined unto his wife), and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery.\"[fn-80-P8042_2287150:844-nf] In passing,[fn-80-P8043_2287185:845-nf] (I would say that) it is enough for me that the works of the Creator are great mysteries[fn-80-P8044_2287293:846-nf] in the estimation of the apostle, although they are so vilely esteemed by the heretics. \"But I am speaking,\" says he, \"of Christ and the Church.\"[fn-80-P8045_2287464:847-nf] This he says in explanation of the mystery, not for its disruption. He shows us that the mystery was prefigured by Him who is also the author of the mystery. Now what is Marcion's opinion? The Creator could not possibly have furnished figures to an unknown god, or, if a known one, an adversary to Himself. The superior god, in fact, ought to have borrowed nothing from the inferior; he was bound rather to annihilate Him. \"Children should obey their parents.\"[fn-80-P8046_2287944:848-nf] Now, although Marcion has erased (the next clause), \"which is the first commandment with promise,\"[fn-80-P8047_2288062:849-nf] still the law says plainly, \"Honour thy father and thy mother.\"[fn-80-P8048_2288248:850-nf] Again, (the apostle writes: ) \"Parents, bring up your children in the fear and admonition of the Lord.\"[fn-80-P8049_2288371:851-nf] For you have heard how it was said to them of old time: \"Ye shall relate these things to your children; and your children in like manner to their children.\"[fn-80-P8050_2288547:852-nf] Of what use are two gods to me, when the discipline is but one?

But as our struggle lies against \"the rulers of this world,\"[fn-80-P8051_2288771:853-nf] what a host of Creator Gods there must be![fn-80-P8052_2288834:854-nf] For why should I not insist upon this point here, that he ought to have mentioned but one \"ruler of this world,\" if he meant only the Creator to be the being to whom belonged all the powers which he previously mentioned? Again, when in the preceding verse he bids us \"put on the whole armour of God, that we may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil,\"[fn-80-P8053_2289330:855-nf] does he not show that all the things which he mentions after the devil's name really belong to the devil-\"the principalities and the powers, and the tillers of the darkness of this world,\"[fn-80-P8054_2289539:856-nf] which we also ascribe to the devil's authority? Else, if \"the devil\" means the Creator, who will be the devil in the Creator's dispensation?[fn-80-P8055_2289700:857-nf] As there are two gods, must there also be two devils, and a plurality of powers and rulers of this world? But how is the Creator both a devil and a god at the same time, when the devil is not at once both god and devil? For either they are both of them gods, if both of them are devils; or else He who is God is not also devil, as neither is he god who is the devil. I want to know indeed by what perversion[fn-80-P8056_2290131:858-nf] the word devil is at all applicable to the Creator. Perhaps he perverted some purpose of the superior god-conduct such as He experienced Himself from the archangel, who lied indeed for the purpose. For He did not forbid (our first parents) a taste of the miserable tree,[fn-80-P8057_2290426:859-nf] from any apprehension that they would become gods; His prohibition was meant to prevent their dying after the transgression. But \"the spiritual wickedness\"[fn-80-P8058_2290609:860-nf] did not signify the Creator, because of the apostle's additional description, \"in heavenly places; \"[fn-80-P8059_2290757:861-nf] for the apostle was quite aware that \"spiritual wickedness\" had been at work in heavenly places, when angels were entrapped into sin by the daughters of men.[fn-80-P8060_2290934:862-nf] But how happened it that (the apostle) resorted to ambiguous descriptions, and I know not what obscure enigmas, for the purpose of disparaging[fn-80-P8061_2291240:863-nf] the Creator, when he displayed to the Church such constancy and plainness of speech in \"making known the mystery of the gospel for which he was an ambassador in bonds,\" owing to his liberty in preaching-and actually requested (the Ephesians) to pray to God that this \"open-mouthed utterance\" might be continued to him?[fn-80-P8062_2291718:864-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"64","folder":"ANF-03","text":"As our heretic is so fond of his pruning-knife, I do not wonder when syllables are expunged by his hand, seeing that entire pages are usually the matter on which he practises his effacing process.

If the Creator's, how does it come to pass that such a God as He could have meant His wisdom to be displayed to the principalities and powers, but not to Himself? For surely no principalities could possibly have understood anything without their sovereign Lord. Or if (the apostle) did not mention God in this passage, on the ground that He (as their chief) is Himself reckoned among these (principalities), then he would have plainly said that the mystery had been hidden from the principalities and powers of Him who had created all things, including Him amongst them. But if he states that it was hidden from them, he must needs be understood[fn-80-P8013_2280952:815-nf] as having meant that it was manifest to Him. From God, therefore, the mystery was not hidden; but it was hidden in God, the Creator of all things, from His principalities and powers. For \"who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been His counsellor? \"[fn-80-P8014_2281228:816-nf] Caught in this trap, the heretic probably changed the passage, with the view of saying that his god wished to make known to his principalities and powers the fellowship of his own mystery, of which God, who created all things, had been ignorant. But what was the use of his obtruding this ignorance of the Creator, who was a stranger to the superior god,[fn-80-P8015_2281603:817-nf] and far enough removed from him, when even his own servants had known nothing about him? To the Creator, however, the future was well known. Then why was not that also known to Him, which had to be revealed beneath His heaven, and on His earth? From this, therefore, there arises a confirmation of what we have already laid down. For since the Creator was sure to know, some time or other, that hidden mystery of the superior god, even on the supposition that the true reading was (as Marcion has it)-\"hidden from the God who created all things\"-he ought then to have expressed the conclusion thus: \"in order that the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to Him, and then to the principalities and powers of God, whosoever He might be, with whom the Creator was destined to share their knowledge.\" So palpable is the erasure in this passage, when thus read, consistently with its own true bearing.

For when by David Christ is sung as \"girded with His sword upon His thigh,\"[fn-80-P8017_2283078:819-nf] or by Isaiah as \"taking away the spoils of Samaria and the power of Damascus,\"[fn-80-P8018_2283176:820-nf] you make Him out to be[fn-80-P8019_2283220:821-nf] really and truly a warrior confest to the eye.[fn-80-P8020_2283284:822-nf] Learn then now, that His is a spiritual armour and warfare, since you have already discovered that the captivity is spiritual, in order that you may further learn that this also belongs to Him, even because the apostle derived the mention of the captivity from the same prophets as suggested to him his precepts likewise: \"Putting away lying,\" (says he, ) \"speak every man truth with his neighbour; \"[fn-80-P8021_2283742:823-nf] and again, using the very words in which the Psalm[fn-80-P8022_2283813:824-nf] expresses his meaning, (he says, ) \"Be ye angry, and sin not; \"[fn-80-P8023_2283895:825-nf] \"Let not the sun go down upon your wrath.\"[fn-80-P8024_2283958:826-nf] \"Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness; \"[fn-80-P8025_2284039:827-nf] for (in the Psalm it is written, ) \"With the holy man thou shalt be holy, and with the perverse thou shalt be perverse; \"[fn-80-P8026_2284180:828-nf] and, \"Thou shalt put away evil from among you.\"[fn-80-P8027_2284250:829-nf] Again, \"Go ye out from the midst of them; touch not the unclean thing; separate yourselves, ye that bear the vessels of the Lord.\"[fn-80-P8028_2284432:830-nf] (The apostle says further: ) \"Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess,\"[fn-80-P8029_2284552:831-nf] -a precept which is suggested by the passage (of the prophet), where the seducers of the consecrated (Nazarites) to drunkenness are rebuked: \"Ye gave wine to my holy ones to drink.\"[fn-80-P8030_2284753:832-nf] This prohibition from drink was given also to the high priest Aaron and his sons, \"when they went into the holy place.\"[fn-80-P8031_2284894:833-nf] The command, to \"sing to the Lord with psalms and hymns,\"[fn-80-P8032_2284970:834-nf] comes suitably from him who knew that those who \"drank wine with drums and psalteries\" were blamed by God.[fn-80-P8033_2285096:835-nf] Now, when I find to what God belong these precepts, whether in their germ or their development, I have no difficulty in knowing to whom the apostle also belongs. But he declares that \"wives ought to be in subjection to their husbands: \"[fn-80-P8034_2285357:836-nf] what reason does he give for this? \"Because,\" says he, \"the husband is the head of the wife.\"[fn-80-P8035_2285474:837-nf] Pray tell me, Marcion, does your god build up the authority of his law on the work of the Creator? This, however, is a comparative trifle; for he actually derives from the same source the condition of his Christ and his Church; for he says: \"even as Christ is the head of the Church; \"[fn-80-P8036_2285779:838-nf] and again, in like manner: \"He who loveth his wife, loveth his own flesh, even as Christ loved the Church.\"[fn-80-P8037_2285906:839-nf] You see how your Christ and your Church are put in comparison with the work of the Creator. How much honour is given to the flesh in the name of the church! \"No man,\" says the apostle, \"ever yet hated his own flesh\" (except, of course, Marcion alone), \"but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord doth the Church.\"[fn-80-P8038_2286251:840-nf] But you are the only man that hates his flesh, for you rob it of its resurrection. It will be only right that you should hate the Church also, because it is loved by Christ on the same principle.[fn-80-P8039_2286466:841-nf] Yea, Christ loved the flesh even as the Church. For no man will love the picture of his wife without taking care of it, and honouring it and crowning it. The likeness partakes with the reality in the privileged honour. I shall now endeavour, from my point of view,[fn-80-P8040_2286747:842-nf] to prove that the same God is (the God) of the man[fn-80-P8041_2286810:843-nf] and of Christ, of the woman and of the Church, of the flesh and the spirit, by the apostle's help who applies the Creator's injunction, and adds even a comment on it: \"For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother, (and shall be joined unto his wife), and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery.\"[fn-80-P8042_2287150:844-nf] In passing,[fn-80-P8043_2287185:845-nf] (I would say that) it is enough for me that the works of the Creator are great mysteries[fn-80-P8044_2287293:846-nf] in the estimation of the apostle, although they are so vilely esteemed by the heretics. \"But I am speaking,\" says he, \"of Christ and the Church.\"[fn-80-P8045_2287464:847-nf] This he says in explanation of the mystery, not for its disruption. He shows us that the mystery was prefigured by Him who is also the author of the mystery. Now what is Marcion's opinion? The Creator could not possibly have furnished figures to an unknown god, or, if a known one, an adversary to Himself. The superior god, in fact, ought to have borrowed nothing from the inferior; he was bound rather to annihilate Him. \"Children should obey their parents.\"[fn-80-P8046_2287944:848-nf] Now, although Marcion has erased (the next clause), \"which is the first commandment with promise,\"[fn-80-P8047_2288062:849-nf] still the law says plainly, \"Honour thy father and thy mother.\"[fn-80-P8048_2288248:850-nf] Again, (the apostle writes: ) \"Parents, bring up your children in the fear and admonition of the Lord.\"[fn-80-P8049_2288371:851-nf] For you have heard how it was said to them of old time: \"Ye shall relate these things to your children; and your children in like manner to their children.\"[fn-80-P8050_2288547:852-nf] Of what use are two gods to me, when the discipline is but one?

But as our struggle lies against \"the rulers of this world,\"[fn-80-P8051_2288771:853-nf] what a host of Creator Gods there must be![fn-80-P8052_2288834:854-nf] For why should I not insist upon this point here, that he ought to have mentioned but one \"ruler of this world,\" if he meant only the Creator to be the being to whom belonged all the powers which he previously mentioned? Again, when in the preceding verse he bids us \"put on the whole armour of God, that we may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil,\"[fn-80-P8053_2289330:855-nf] does he not show that all the things which he mentions after the devil's name really belong to the devil-\"the principalities and the powers, and the tillers of the darkness of this world,\"[fn-80-P8054_2289539:856-nf] which we also ascribe to the devil's authority? Else, if \"the devil\" means the Creator, who will be the devil in the Creator's dispensation?[fn-80-P8055_2289700:857-nf] As there are two gods, must there also be two devils, and a plurality of powers and rulers of this world? But how is the Creator both a devil and a god at the same time, when the devil is not at once both god and devil? For either they are both of them gods, if both of them are devils; or else He who is God is not also devil, as neither is he god who is the devil. I want to know indeed by what perversion[fn-80-P8056_2290131:858-nf] the word devil is at all applicable to the Creator. Perhaps he perverted some purpose of the superior god-conduct such as He experienced Himself from the archangel, who lied indeed for the purpose. For He did not forbid (our first parents) a taste of the miserable tree,[fn-80-P8057_2290426:859-nf] from any apprehension that they would become gods; His prohibition was meant to prevent their dying after the transgression. But \"the spiritual wickedness\"[fn-80-P8058_2290609:860-nf] did not signify the Creator, because of the apostle's additional description, \"in heavenly places; \"[fn-80-P8059_2290757:861-nf] for the apostle was quite aware that \"spiritual wickedness\" had been at work in heavenly places, when angels were entrapped into sin by the daughters of men.[fn-80-P8060_2290934:862-nf] But how happened it that (the apostle) resorted to ambiguous descriptions, and I know not what obscure enigmas, for the purpose of disparaging[fn-80-P8061_2291240:863-nf] the Creator, when he displayed to the Church such constancy and plainness of speech in \"making known the mystery of the gospel for which he was an ambassador in bonds,\" owing to his liberty in preaching-and actually requested (the Ephesians) to pray to God that this \"open-mouthed utterance\" might be continued to him?[fn-80-P8062_2291718:864-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"64","folder":"ANF-03","text":"As our heretic is so fond of his pruning-knife, I do not wonder when syllables are expunged by his hand, seeing that entire pages are usually the matter on which he practises his effacing process.

If the Creator's, how does it come to pass that such a God as He could have meant His wisdom to be displayed to the principalities and powers, but not to Himself? For surely no principalities could possibly have understood anything without their sovereign Lord. Or if (the apostle) did not mention God in this passage, on the ground that He (as their chief) is Himself reckoned among these (principalities), then he would have plainly said that the mystery had been hidden from the principalities and powers of Him who had created all things, including Him amongst them. But if he states that it was hidden from them, he must needs be understood[fn-80-P8013_2280952:815-nf] as having meant that it was manifest to Him. From God, therefore, the mystery was not hidden; but it was hidden in God, the Creator of all things, from His principalities and powers. For \"who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been His counsellor? \"[fn-80-P8014_2281228:816-nf] Caught in this trap, the heretic probably changed the passage, with the view of saying that his god wished to make known to his principalities and powers the fellowship of his own mystery, of which God, who created all things, had been ignorant. But what was the use of his obtruding this ignorance of the Creator, who was a stranger to the superior god,[fn-80-P8015_2281603:817-nf] and far enough removed from him, when even his own servants had known nothing about him? To the Creator, however, the future was well known. Then why was not that also known to Him, which had to be revealed beneath His heaven, and on His earth? From this, therefore, there arises a confirmation of what we have already laid down. For since the Creator was sure to know, some time or other, that hidden mystery of the superior god, even on the supposition that the true reading was (as Marcion has it)-\"hidden from the God who created all things\"-he ought then to have expressed the conclusion thus: \"in order that the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to Him, and then to the principalities and powers of God, whosoever He might be, with whom the Creator was destined to share their knowledge.\" So palpable is the erasure in this passage, when thus read, consistently with its own true bearing.

For when by David Christ is sung as \"girded with His sword upon His thigh,\"[fn-80-P8017_2283078:819-nf] or by Isaiah as \"taking away the spoils of Samaria and the power of Damascus,\"[fn-80-P8018_2283176:820-nf] you make Him out to be[fn-80-P8019_2283220:821-nf] really and truly a warrior confest to the eye.[fn-80-P8020_2283284:822-nf] Learn then now, that His is a spiritual armour and warfare, since you have already discovered that the captivity is spiritual, in order that you may further learn that this also belongs to Him, even because the apostle derived the mention of the captivity from the same prophets as suggested to him his precepts likewise: \"Putting away lying,\" (says he, ) \"speak every man truth with his neighbour; \"[fn-80-P8021_2283742:823-nf] and again, using the very words in which the Psalm[fn-80-P8022_2283813:824-nf] expresses his meaning, (he says, ) \"Be ye angry, and sin not; \"[fn-80-P8023_2283895:825-nf] \"Let not the sun go down upon your wrath.\"[fn-80-P8024_2283958:826-nf] \"Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness; \"[fn-80-P8025_2284039:827-nf] for (in the Psalm it is written, ) \"With the holy man thou shalt be holy, and with the perverse thou shalt be perverse; \"[fn-80-P8026_2284180:828-nf] and, \"Thou shalt put away evil from among you.\"[fn-80-P8027_2284250:829-nf] Again, \"Go ye out from the midst of them; touch not the unclean thing; separate yourselves, ye that bear the vessels of the Lord.\"[fn-80-P8028_2284432:830-nf] (The apostle says further: ) \"Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess,\"[fn-80-P8029_2284552:831-nf] -a precept which is suggested by the passage (of the prophet), where the seducers of the consecrated (Nazarites) to drunkenness are rebuked: \"Ye gave wine to my holy ones to drink.\"[fn-80-P8030_2284753:832-nf] This prohibition from drink was given also to the high priest Aaron and his sons, \"when they went into the holy place.\"[fn-80-P8031_2284894:833-nf] The command, to \"sing to the Lord with psalms and hymns,\"[fn-80-P8032_2284970:834-nf] comes suitably from him who knew that those who \"drank wine with drums and psalteries\" were blamed by God.[fn-80-P8033_2285096:835-nf] Now, when I find to what God belong these precepts, whether in their germ or their development, I have no difficulty in knowing to whom the apostle also belongs. But he declares that \"wives ought to be in subjection to their husbands: \"[fn-80-P8034_2285357:836-nf] what reason does he give for this? \"Because,\" says he, \"the husband is the head of the wife.\"[fn-80-P8035_2285474:837-nf] Pray tell me, Marcion, does your god build up the authority of his law on the work of the Creator? This, however, is a comparative trifle; for he actually derives from the same source the condition of his Christ and his Church; for he says: \"even as Christ is the head of the Church; \"[fn-80-P8036_2285779:838-nf] and again, in like manner: \"He who loveth his wife, loveth his own flesh, even as Christ loved the Church.\"[fn-80-P8037_2285906:839-nf] You see how your Christ and your Church are put in comparison with the work of the Creator. How much honour is given to the flesh in the name of the church! \"No man,\" says the apostle, \"ever yet hated his own flesh\" (except, of course, Marcion alone), \"but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord doth the Church.\"[fn-80-P8038_2286251:840-nf] But you are the only man that hates his flesh, for you rob it of its resurrection. It will be only right that you should hate the Church also, because it is loved by Christ on the same principle.[fn-80-P8039_2286466:841-nf] Yea, Christ loved the flesh even as the Church. For no man will love the picture of his wife without taking care of it, and honouring it and crowning it. The likeness partakes with the reality in the privileged honour. I shall now endeavour, from my point of view,[fn-80-P8040_2286747:842-nf] to prove that the same God is (the God) of the man[fn-80-P8041_2286810:843-nf] and of Christ, of the woman and of the Church, of the flesh and the spirit, by the apostle's help who applies the Creator's injunction, and adds even a comment on it: \"For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother, (and shall be joined unto his wife), and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery.\"[fn-80-P8042_2287150:844-nf] In passing,[fn-80-P8043_2287185:845-nf] (I would say that) it is enough for me that the works of the Creator are great mysteries[fn-80-P8044_2287293:846-nf] in the estimation of the apostle, although they are so vilely esteemed by the heretics. \"But I am speaking,\" says he, \"of Christ and the Church.\"[fn-80-P8045_2287464:847-nf] This he says in explanation of the mystery, not for its disruption. He shows us that the mystery was prefigured by Him who is also the author of the mystery. Now what is Marcion's opinion? The Creator could not possibly have furnished figures to an unknown god, or, if a known one, an adversary to Himself. The superior god, in fact, ought to have borrowed nothing from the inferior; he was bound rather to annihilate Him. \"Children should obey their parents.\"[fn-80-P8046_2287944:848-nf] Now, although Marcion has erased (the next clause), \"which is the first commandment with promise,\"[fn-80-P8047_2288062:849-nf] still the law says plainly, \"Honour thy father and thy mother.\"[fn-80-P8048_2288248:850-nf] Again, (the apostle writes: ) \"Parents, bring up your children in the fear and admonition of the Lord.\"[fn-80-P8049_2288371:851-nf] For you have heard how it was said to them of old time: \"Ye shall relate these things to your children; and your children in like manner to their children.\"[fn-80-P8050_2288547:852-nf] Of what use are two gods to me, when the discipline is but one?

But as our struggle lies against \"the rulers of this world,\"[fn-80-P8051_2288771:853-nf] what a host of Creator Gods there must be![fn-80-P8052_2288834:854-nf] For why should I not insist upon this point here, that he ought to have mentioned but one \"ruler of this world,\" if he meant only the Creator to be the being to whom belonged all the powers which he previously mentioned? Again, when in the preceding verse he bids us \"put on the whole armour of God, that we may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil,\"[fn-80-P8053_2289330:855-nf] does he not show that all the things which he mentions after the devil's name really belong to the devil-\"the principalities and the powers, and the tillers of the darkness of this world,\"[fn-80-P8054_2289539:856-nf] which we also ascribe to the devil's authority? Else, if \"the devil\" means the Creator, who will be the devil in the Creator's dispensation?[fn-80-P8055_2289700:857-nf] As there are two gods, must there also be two devils, and a plurality of powers and rulers of this world? But how is the Creator both a devil and a god at the same time, when the devil is not at once both god and devil? For either they are both of them gods, if both of them are devils; or else He who is God is not also devil, as neither is he god who is the devil. I want to know indeed by what perversion[fn-80-P8056_2290131:858-nf] the word devil is at all applicable to the Creator. Perhaps he perverted some purpose of the superior god-conduct such as He experienced Himself from the archangel, who lied indeed for the purpose. For He did not forbid (our first parents) a taste of the miserable tree,[fn-80-P8057_2290426:859-nf] from any apprehension that they would become gods; His prohibition was meant to prevent their dying after the transgression. But \"the spiritual wickedness\"[fn-80-P8058_2290609:860-nf] did not signify the Creator, because of the apostle's additional description, \"in heavenly places; \"[fn-80-P8059_2290757:861-nf] for the apostle was quite aware that \"spiritual wickedness\" had been at work in heavenly places, when angels were entrapped into sin by the daughters of men.[fn-80-P8060_2290934:862-nf] But how happened it that (the apostle) resorted to ambiguous descriptions, and I know not what obscure enigmas, for the purpose of disparaging[fn-80-P8061_2291240:863-nf] the Creator, when he displayed to the Church such constancy and plainness of speech in \"making known the mystery of the gospel for which he was an ambassador in bonds,\" owing to his liberty in preaching-and actually requested (the Ephesians) to pray to God that this \"open-mouthed utterance\" might be continued to him?[fn-80-P8062_2291718:864-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":12,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"64","folder":"ANF-03","text":"As our heretic is so fond of his pruning-knife, I do not wonder when syllables are expunged by his hand, seeing that entire pages are usually the matter on which he practises his effacing process.

If the Creator's, how does it come to pass that such a God as He could have meant His wisdom to be displayed to the principalities and powers, but not to Himself? For surely no principalities could possibly have understood anything without their sovereign Lord. Or if (the apostle) did not mention God in this passage, on the ground that He (as their chief) is Himself reckoned among these (principalities), then he would have plainly said that the mystery had been hidden from the principalities and powers of Him who had created all things, including Him amongst them. But if he states that it was hidden from them, he must needs be understood[fn-80-P8013_2280952:815-nf] as having meant that it was manifest to Him. From God, therefore, the mystery was not hidden; but it was hidden in God, the Creator of all things, from His principalities and powers. For \"who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been His counsellor? \"[fn-80-P8014_2281228:816-nf] Caught in this trap, the heretic probably changed the passage, with the view of saying that his god wished to make known to his principalities and powers the fellowship of his own mystery, of which God, who created all things, had been ignorant. But what was the use of his obtruding this ignorance of the Creator, who was a stranger to the superior god,[fn-80-P8015_2281603:817-nf] and far enough removed from him, when even his own servants had known nothing about him? To the Creator, however, the future was well known. Then why was not that also known to Him, which had to be revealed beneath His heaven, and on His earth? From this, therefore, there arises a confirmation of what we have already laid down. For since the Creator was sure to know, some time or other, that hidden mystery of the superior god, even on the supposition that the true reading was (as Marcion has it)-\"hidden from the God who created all things\"-he ought then to have expressed the conclusion thus: \"in order that the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to Him, and then to the principalities and powers of God, whosoever He might be, with whom the Creator was destined to share their knowledge.\" So palpable is the erasure in this passage, when thus read, consistently with its own true bearing.

For when by David Christ is sung as \"girded with His sword upon His thigh,\"[fn-80-P8017_2283078:819-nf] or by Isaiah as \"taking away the spoils of Samaria and the power of Damascus,\"[fn-80-P8018_2283176:820-nf] you make Him out to be[fn-80-P8019_2283220:821-nf] really and truly a warrior confest to the eye.[fn-80-P8020_2283284:822-nf] Learn then now, that His is a spiritual armour and warfare, since you have already discovered that the captivity is spiritual, in order that you may further learn that this also belongs to Him, even because the apostle derived the mention of the captivity from the same prophets as suggested to him his precepts likewise: \"Putting away lying,\" (says he, ) \"speak every man truth with his neighbour; \"[fn-80-P8021_2283742:823-nf] and again, using the very words in which the Psalm[fn-80-P8022_2283813:824-nf] expresses his meaning, (he says, ) \"Be ye angry, and sin not; \"[fn-80-P8023_2283895:825-nf] \"Let not the sun go down upon your wrath.\"[fn-80-P8024_2283958:826-nf] \"Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness; \"[fn-80-P8025_2284039:827-nf] for (in the Psalm it is written, ) \"With the holy man thou shalt be holy, and with the perverse thou shalt be perverse; \"[fn-80-P8026_2284180:828-nf] and, \"Thou shalt put away evil from among you.\"[fn-80-P8027_2284250:829-nf] Again, \"Go ye out from the midst of them; touch not the unclean thing; separate yourselves, ye that bear the vessels of the Lord.\"[fn-80-P8028_2284432:830-nf] (The apostle says further: ) \"Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess,\"[fn-80-P8029_2284552:831-nf] -a precept which is suggested by the passage (of the prophet), where the seducers of the consecrated (Nazarites) to drunkenness are rebuked: \"Ye gave wine to my holy ones to drink.\"[fn-80-P8030_2284753:832-nf] This prohibition from drink was given also to the high priest Aaron and his sons, \"when they went into the holy place.\"[fn-80-P8031_2284894:833-nf] The command, to \"sing to the Lord with psalms and hymns,\"[fn-80-P8032_2284970:834-nf] comes suitably from him who knew that those who \"drank wine with drums and psalteries\" were blamed by God.[fn-80-P8033_2285096:835-nf] Now, when I find to what God belong these precepts, whether in their germ or their development, I have no difficulty in knowing to whom the apostle also belongs. But he declares that \"wives ought to be in subjection to their husbands: \"[fn-80-P8034_2285357:836-nf] what reason does he give for this? \"Because,\" says he, \"the husband is the head of the wife.\"[fn-80-P8035_2285474:837-nf] Pray tell me, Marcion, does your god build up the authority of his law on the work of the Creator? This, however, is a comparative trifle; for he actually derives from the same source the condition of his Christ and his Church; for he says: \"even as Christ is the head of the Church; \"[fn-80-P8036_2285779:838-nf] and again, in like manner: \"He who loveth his wife, loveth his own flesh, even as Christ loved the Church.\"[fn-80-P8037_2285906:839-nf] You see how your Christ and your Church are put in comparison with the work of the Creator. How much honour is given to the flesh in the name of the church! \"No man,\" says the apostle, \"ever yet hated his own flesh\" (except, of course, Marcion alone), \"but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord doth the Church.\"[fn-80-P8038_2286251:840-nf] But you are the only man that hates his flesh, for you rob it of its resurrection. It will be only right that you should hate the Church also, because it is loved by Christ on the same principle.[fn-80-P8039_2286466:841-nf] Yea, Christ loved the flesh even as the Church. For no man will love the picture of his wife without taking care of it, and honouring it and crowning it. The likeness partakes with the reality in the privileged honour. I shall now endeavour, from my point of view,[fn-80-P8040_2286747:842-nf] to prove that the same God is (the God) of the man[fn-80-P8041_2286810:843-nf] and of Christ, of the woman and of the Church, of the flesh and the spirit, by the apostle's help who applies the Creator's injunction, and adds even a comment on it: \"For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother, (and shall be joined unto his wife), and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery.\"[fn-80-P8042_2287150:844-nf] In passing,[fn-80-P8043_2287185:845-nf] (I would say that) it is enough for me that the works of the Creator are great mysteries[fn-80-P8044_2287293:846-nf] in the estimation of the apostle, although they are so vilely esteemed by the heretics. \"But I am speaking,\" says he, \"of Christ and the Church.\"[fn-80-P8045_2287464:847-nf] This he says in explanation of the mystery, not for its disruption. He shows us that the mystery was prefigured by Him who is also the author of the mystery. Now what is Marcion's opinion? The Creator could not possibly have furnished figures to an unknown god, or, if a known one, an adversary to Himself. The superior god, in fact, ought to have borrowed nothing from the inferior; he was bound rather to annihilate Him. \"Children should obey their parents.\"[fn-80-P8046_2287944:848-nf] Now, although Marcion has erased (the next clause), \"which is the first commandment with promise,\"[fn-80-P8047_2288062:849-nf] still the law says plainly, \"Honour thy father and thy mother.\"[fn-80-P8048_2288248:850-nf] Again, (the apostle writes: ) \"Parents, bring up your children in the fear and admonition of the Lord.\"[fn-80-P8049_2288371:851-nf] For you have heard how it was said to them of old time: \"Ye shall relate these things to your children; and your children in like manner to their children.\"[fn-80-P8050_2288547:852-nf] Of what use are two gods to me, when the discipline is but one? If there must be two, I mean to follow Him who was the first to teach the lesson. But as our struggle lies against \"the rulers of this world,\"[fn-80-P8051_2288771:853-nf] what a host of Creator Gods there must be![fn-80-P8052_2288834:854-nf] For why should I not insist upon this point here, that he ought to have mentioned but one \"ruler of this world,\" if he meant only the Creator to be the being to whom belonged all the powers which he previously mentioned? Again, when in the preceding verse he bids us \"put on the whole armour of God, that we may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil,\"[fn-80-P8053_2289330:855-nf] does he not show that all the things which he mentions after the devil's name really belong to the devil-\"the principalities and the powers, and the tillers of the darkness of this world,\"[fn-80-P8054_2289539:856-nf] which we also ascribe to the devil's authority? Else, if \"the devil\" means the Creator, who will be the devil in the Creator's dispensation?[fn-80-P8055_2289700:857-nf] As there are two gods, must there also be two devils, and a plurality of powers and rulers of this world? But how is the Creator both a devil and a god at the same time, when the devil is not at once both god and devil? For either they are both of them gods, if both of them are devils; or else He who is God is not also devil, as neither is he god who is the devil. I want to know indeed by what perversion[fn-80-P8056_2290131:858-nf] the word devil is at all applicable to the Creator. Perhaps he perverted some purpose of the superior god-conduct such as He experienced Himself from the archangel, who lied indeed for the purpose. For He did not forbid (our first parents) a taste of the miserable tree,[fn-80-P8057_2290426:859-nf] from any apprehension that they would become gods; His prohibition was meant to prevent their dying after the transgression. But \"the spiritual wickedness\"[fn-80-P8058_2290609:860-nf] did not signify the Creator, because of the apostle's additional description, \"in heavenly places; \"[fn-80-P8059_2290757:861-nf] for the apostle was quite aware that \"spiritual wickedness\" had been at work in heavenly places, when angels were entrapped into sin by the daughters of men.[fn-80-P8060_2290934:862-nf] But how happened it that (the apostle) resorted to ambiguous descriptions, and I know not what obscure enigmas, for the purpose of disparaging[fn-80-P8061_2291240:863-nf] the Creator, when he displayed to the Church such constancy and plainness of speech in \"making known the mystery of the gospel for which he was an ambassador in bonds,\" owing to his liberty in preaching-and actually requested (the Ephesians) to pray to God that this \"open-mouthed utterance\" might be continued to him?[fn-80-P8062_2291718:864-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"443","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In the Epistle of Paul to the Ephesians: \"Children, be obedient to your parents: for this is right.

It was the want of clear views on this question that originated, or at least greatly aggravated, the Pelagian heresy. And the efforts of Tichonius to clear up this point were good, but not complete. For, in discussing the question about faith and works, he said that works were given us by God as the reward of faith, but that faith itself was so far our own that it did not come to us from God; not keeping in mind the saying of the apostle: \"Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,\"[fn-52-P5234_2779975:73-nf] But he had not come into contact with this heresy, which has arisen in our time, and has given us much labor and trouble in defending against it the grace of God which is through our Lord Jesus Christ, and which (according to the saying of the apostle, \"There must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you\"[fn-52-P5235_2780347:74-nf] ) has made us much more watchful and diligent to discover in Scripture what escaped Tichonius, who, having no enemy to guard against, was less attentive and anxious on this point, namely, that even faith itself is the gift of Him who \"hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.\"[fn-52-P5236_2780649:75-nf] Whence it is said to certain believers: \"Unto you it is given, in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake.\"[fn-52-P5237_2780817:76-nf] Who, then, can doubt that each of these is the gift of God, when he learns from this passage, and believes, that each of them is given?

But neither could this be the case, as we have shown elsewhere.[fn-12-P1223_338330:50-nf] And it is difficult to conceive that the immortal soul, which is impeded by the members of the body, should become more intelligent when it has migrated from it. For the demons, inspired with frenzy against men by reason of their own wickedness, pervert their minds, which already incline downwards, by various deceptive scenic representations, that they may be disabled from rising to the path that leads to heaven. But from us the things which are in the world are not hidden, and the divine is easily apprehended by us if the power that makes souls immortal visits us. The demons are seen also by the men possessed of soul, when, as sometimes, they exhibit themselves to men, either that they may be thought to be something, or as evil-disposed friends may do harm to them as to enemies, or afford occasions of doing them honour to those who resemble them.

Should any one wish to conquer them, let him repudiate matter. Being armed with the breastplate[fn-12-P1224_339593:51-nf] of the celestial Spirit, he will be able to preserve all that is encompassed by it. There are, indeed, diseases and disturbances of the matter that is in us; but, when such things happen, the demons ascribe the causes of them to themselves, and approach a man whenever disease lays hold of him. Sometimes they themselves disturb the habit of the body by a tempest of folly; but, being smitten by the word of God, they depart in terror, and the sick man is healed.","title":"Address of Tatian to the Greeks.","author":"Tatian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":12,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_38_against_the_valentinians_","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"87","folder":"ANF-03","text":"The odium felt amongst them[fn-90-P9074_2507446:220-nf] against the devil is the more excusable,[fn-90-P9075_2507514:221-nf] even because the peculiarly sordid character of his origin justifies it.[fn-90-P9076_2507608:222-nf] For he is supposed by them to have had his origin in that criminal excess[fn-90-P9077_2507742:223-nf] of her[fn-90-P9078_2507769:224-nf] sorrow, from which they also derive the birth of the angels, and demons, and all the wicked spirits.

And in order, therefore, that they may know that this also pertains to grace, let them read what the apostle says: \"And that ye be in nothing terrified by your adversaries, which indeed is to them a cause of perdition, but of your salvation, and that of God; for unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake.\"[fn-50-P5051_1993807:8-nf] Certainly he said that both were given.

And He said, Therefore I said unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given him of my Father.\"[fn-50-P5055_1994725:12-nf] He repeated, to wit, the saying in which He had said, \"No man can come unto me, except the Father who hath sent me shall draw him.\" And He declared that He said this for the sake of believers and unbelievers, explaining what He had said, \"except the Father who hath sent me shall draw him,\" by repeating the very same thing in other words in that which He said, \"except it were given him of my Father.\" Because he is drawn to Christ to whom it is given to believe on Christ. Therefore the power is given that they who believe on Him should become the sons of God, since this very thing is given, that they believe on Him. And unless this power be given from God, out of free will there can be none; because it will not be free for good if the deliverer have not made it free; but in evil he has a free will in whom a deceiver, either secret or manifest, has grafted the love of wickedness, or he himself has persuaded himself of it.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_41_the_epistle_of_barnabas","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"62","folder":"ANF-01","text":"The way of light, then, is as follows.

As when it is said, \"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth; \"[fn-59-P5916_2316303:22-nf] and, \"Fear not them which kill the body;\"[fn-59-P5917_2316364:23-nf] and, \"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself;\"[fn-59-P5918_2316441:24-nf] and again, \"Peace on earth to men of good will.\"[fn-59-P5919_2316510:25-nf] So also that the Apostle Paul says: \"Let him do what he willeth; he sinneth not if he marry. Nevertheless, he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.\"[fn-59-P5920_2316806:26-nf] And so again,\" If I do this willingly, I have a reward;\"[fn-59-P5921_2316888:27-nf] while in another passage he says, \"Be ye sober and righteous, and sin not;\"[fn-59-P5922_2316984:28-nf] and again, \"As ye have a readiness to will, so also let there be a prompt performance;\"[fn-59-P5923_2317092:29-nf] then he remarks to Timothy about the younger widows, \"When they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they choose to marry.\" So in another passage, \"All that will to live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution;\"[fn-59-P5924_2317337:30-nf] while to Timothy himself he says, \"Neglect not the gift that is in thee.\"[fn-59-P5925_2317432:31-nf] Then to Philemon he addresses this explanation: \"That thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but of thine own will.\"[fn-59-P5926_2317581:32-nf] Servants also he advises to obey their masters \"with a good will.\"[fn-59-P5927_2317666:33-nf] In strict accordance with this, James says: \"Do not err, my beloved brethren . . . and have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ with respect to persons;\"[fn-59-P5928_2317840:34-nf] and,\" Do not speak evil one of another.\"[fn-59-P5929_2317908:35-nf] So also John in his Epistle writes,\" Do not love the world,\"[fn-59-P5930_2317987:36-nf] and other things of the same import.

No man, therefore, when he sins, can in his heart blame God for it, but every man must impute the fault to himself. Nor does it detract at all from a man's own will when he performs any act in accordance with God.

And I do not at all see why the whole should not be attributed to man,-as he who could originatefor himself what he had not previously, can himself increase what he had originated,-except that it is impossible to withstand the most manifest divine testimony by which faith, whence piety takes its beginning, is shown also to be the gift of God: such as is that testimony that\" God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith; \"[fn-66-P6691_2548492:19-nf] and that one, \"Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ,\"[fn-66-P6692_2548621:20-nf] and other similar passages.

And if thou hast received it, why boastest thou as if thou hadst not received it?\"[fn-66-P6697_2549667:22-nf] And it was chiefly by this testimony that I myself also was convinced when I was in a similar error, thinking that faith whereby we believe on God is not God's gift, but that it is in us from ourselves, and that by it we obtain the gifts of God, whereby we may live temperately and righteously and piously in this world. For I did not think that faith was preceded by God's grace, so that by its means would be given to us what we might profitably ask, except that we could not believe if the proclamation of the truth did not precede; but that we should consent when the gospel was preached to us I thought was our own doing, and came to us from ourselves. And this my error is sufficiently indicated in some small works of mine written before my episcopate. Among these is that which you have mentioned in your letters[fn-66-P6698_2550507:23-nf] wherein is an exposition of certain propositions from the Epistle to the Romans. Eventually, when I was retracting all my small works, and was committing that retractation to writing,of which task I had already completed two books before I had taken up your more lengthy letters,-when in the first volume I had reached the retractation of this book, I then spoke thus:-\"Also discussing, I say, `what God could have chosen in him who was as yet unborn, whom He said that the elder should serve; and what in the same elder, equally as yet unborn, He could have rejected; concerning whom, on this account, the prophetic testimony is recorded, although declared long subsequently, \"Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I hated,\"'[fn-66-P6699_2551301:24-nf] I carried out my reasoning to the point of saying: `God did not therefore choose the works of any one in foreknowledge of what He Himself would give them, but he chose the faith, in the foreknowledge that He would choose that very person whom He foreknew would believe on Him,-to whom He would give the Holy Spirit, so that by doing good works he might obtain eternal life also.' I had not yet very carefully sought, nor had I as yet found, what is the nature of the election of grace, of which the apostle says, `A remnant are saved according to the election of grace.'[fn-67-P6700_2551909:25-nf] Which assuredly is not grace if any merits precede it; lest what is now given, not according to grace, but according to debt, be rather paid to merits than freely given. And what I next subjoined: `For the same apostle says, \"The same God which worketh all in all;\"[fn-67-P6701_2552192:26-nf] but it was never said, God believeth all in all;' and then added, `Therefore what we believe is our own, but what good thing we do is of Him who giveth the Holy Spirit to them that believe:' I certainly could not have said, had I already known that faith itself also is found among those gifts of God which are given by the same Spirit. Both, therefore, are ours on account of the choice of the will, and yet both are given by the spirit of faith and love, For faith is not alone but as it is written, `Love with faith, from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.'[fn-67-P6702_2552781:27-nf] And what I said a little after, `For it is ours to believe and to will, but it is His to give to those who believe and will, the power of doing good works through the Holy Spirit, by whom love is shed abroad in our hearts,'-is true indeed; but by the same rule both are also God's, because God prepares the will; and both are ours too, because they are only brought about with our good wills. And thus what I subsequently said also: `Because we are not able to will unless we are called; and when, after our calling, we would will, our willing is not sufficiently nor our running, unless God gives strength to us that run, and leads us whither He calls us;' and thereupon added:' It is plain, therefore, that it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy, that we do good works'-this is absolutely most true. But I discovered little concerning the calling itself, which is according to God's purpose; for not such is the calling of all that are called, but only of the elect. Therefore what I said a little afterwards: `For as in those whom God elects it is not works but faith that begins the merit so as to do good works by the gift of God, so in those whom He condemns, unbelief and impiety begin the merit of punishment, so that even by way of punishment itself they do evil works'-I spoke most truly. But that even the merit itself of faith was God's gift, I neither thought of inquiring into, nor did I say. And in another place I say: `For whom He has mercy upon, He makes to do good works, and whom He hardeneth He leaves to do evil works; but that mercy is bestowed upon the preceding merit of faith, and that hardening is applied to preceding iniquity.' And this indeed is true; but it should further have been asked, whether even the merit of faith does not come from God's mercy,-that is, whether that mercy is manifested in man only because he is a believer, or whether it is also manifested that he may be a believer? For we read in the apostles words: `I obtained mercy to be a believer.'[fn-67-P6703_2554843:28-nf] He does not say, `Because I was a believer.' Therefore although it is given to the believer, yet it has been given also that he may be a believer. Therefore also, in another place in the same book I most truly said: `Because, if it is of God's mercy, and not of works, that we are even called that we may believe and it is granted to us who believe to do good works, that mercy must not be grudged to the heathen;'-although I there discoursed less carefully about that calling which is given according to God's purpose.\"[fn-67-P6704_2555385:29-nf] ","title":"The First Book.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_40_book_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"126","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"And again in the third book of these Commentaries, on the words, \"for which I am an ambassador in chains,\"[fn-87-P8776_2251933:88-nf] after some discussion of the passage, he speaks in the character of that `other' which is himself:","title":"Book I.","author":"Rufinus"},{"chapter":6,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_47_book_iii_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"62","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Let us now look also to the New Testament, where Satan approaches the Saviour, and tempts Him: wherein also it is stated that evil spirits and unclean demons, which had taken possession of very many, were expelled by the Saviour from the bodies of the sufferers, who are said also to be made free by Him.

With respect to the thoughts which proceed from our heart, or the recollection of things which we have done, or the contemplation of any things or causes whatever, we find that they sometimes proceed from ourselves, and sometimes are originated by the opposing powers; not seldom also are they suggested by God, or by the holy angels. Now such a statement will perhaps appear incredible,[fn-71-P7137_1571976:286-nf] unless it be confirmed by the testimony of holy Scripture, That, then, thoughts arise within ourselves, David testifies in the Psalms, saying, \"The thought of a man will make confession to Thee, and the rest of the thought shall observe to Thee a festival day.\"[fn-71-P7138_1572256:287-nf] That this, however, is also brought about by the opposing powers, is shown by Solomon in the book of Ecclesiastes in the following manner: \"If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for soundness restrains great offences.\"[fn-71-P7139_1572638:288-nf] The Apostle Paul also will bear testimony to the same point in the words: \"Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of Christ.\"[fn-71-P7140_1572857:289-nf] That it is an effect due to God, nevertheless, is declared by David, when he says in the Psalms, \"Blessed is the man whose help is in Thee, O Lord, Thy ascents (are) in his heart.\"[fn-71-P7141_1573058:290-nf] And the apostle says that \"God put it into the heart of Titus.\"[fn-71-P7142_1573480:291-nf] That certain thoughts are suggested to men's hearts either by good or evil angels, is shown both by the angel that accompanied Tobias,[fn-71-P7143_1573639:292-nf] and by the language of the prophet, where he says, \"And the angel who spoke in me answered.\"[fn-71-P7144_1573777:293-nf] The book of the Shepherd[fn-71-P7145_1573933:294-nf] declares the same, saying that each individual is attended by two angels; that whenever good thoughts arise in our hearts, they are suggested by the good angel; but when of a contrary kind, they are the instigation of the evil angel. The same is declared by Barnabas in his Epistle,[fn-71-P7146_1574279:295-nf] where he says there are two ways, one of light and one of darkness, over which he asserts that certain angels are placed;-the angels of God over the way of light, the angels of Satan over the way of darkness. We are not, however, to imagine that any other result follows from what is suggested to our heart, whether good or bad, save a (mental) commotion only, and an incitement instigating us either to good or evil. For it is quite within our reach, when a malignant power has begun to incite us to evil, to cast away from us the wicked suggestions, and to resist the vile inducements, and to do nothing that is at all deserving of blame. And, on the other hand, it is possible, when a divine power calls us to better things, not to obey the call; our freedom of will being preserved to us in either case. We said, indeed, in the foregoing pages, that certain recollections of good or evil actions were suggested to us either by the act of divine providence or by the opposing powers, as is shown in the book of Esther, when Artaxerxes had not remembered the services of that just man Mordecai, but, when wearied out with his nightly vigils, had it put into his mind by God to require that the annals of his great deeds should be read to him; whereon, being reminded of the benefits received from Mordecai, he ordered his enemy Haman to be hanged, but splendid honours to be conferred on him, and impunity from the threatened danger to be granted to the whole of the holy nation. On the other hand, however, we must suppose that it was through the hostile influence of the devil that the suggestion was introduced into the minds of the high priests and the scribes which they made to Pilate, when they came and said, \"Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.\"[fn-71-P7147_1576156:296-nf] The design of Judas, also, respecting the betrayal of our Lord and Saviour, did not originate in the wickedness of his mind alone. For Scripture testifies that the \"devil had already put it into his heart to betray Him.\"[fn-71-P7148_1576401:297-nf] And therefore Solomon rightly commanded, saying, \"Keep thy heart with all diligence.\"[fn-71-P7149_1576508:298-nf] And the Apostle Paul warns us: \"Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest perhaps we should let them slip.\"[fn-71-P7150_1576684:299-nf] And when he says, \"Neither give place to the devil,\"[fn-71-P7151_1576756:300-nf] he shows by that injunction that it is through certain acts, or a kind of mental slothfulness, that room is made for the devil, so that, if he once enter our heart, he will either gain possession of us, or at least will pollute the soul, if he has not obtained the entire mastery over it, by casting on us his fiery darts; and by these we are sometimes deeply wounded, and sometimes only set on fire. Seldom indeed, and only in a few instances, are these fiery darts quenched, so as not to find a place where they may wound, i.e., when one is covered by the strong and mighty shield of faith. The declaration, indeed, in the Epistle to the Ephesians, \"We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places,\"[fn-71-P7152_1577608:301-nf] must be so understood as if \"we\" meant, \"I Paul, and you Ephesians, and all who have not to wrestle against flesh and blood: \"for such have to struggle against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, not like the Corinthians, whose struggle was as yet against flesh and blood, and who had been overtaken by no temptation but such as is common to man.","title":"Book III.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":6,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_44_a_treatise_on_the_gift_of_perseverance_being_the_second_book","source_chapter":46,"source_paragraph":"164","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Now, to say nothing more of continency, and to argue in this place of wisdom alone, certainly\nthe Apostle James above mentioned says, \"But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then\npeaceable, modest, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, inestimable, without\nsimulation.\"[fn-71-P7180_2745450:110-nf] Do you not see, I beseech\nyou, how this wisdom descends from the Father of Lights, laden with many and great benefits?

Finally, why did the preaching of\nthis grace not deter the Apostle James from rebuking restless souls, and saying, \"If ye have bitter\nenvying, and contentions are in your hearts, glory not, and be not liars against the truth. This is\nnot the wisdom that cometh down from above, but is earthly, animal, devilish; for where envying and\ncontention are, there are inconstancy and every evil work\"?[fn-71-P7182_2746715:112-nf] As, therefore, the restless are to be rebuked,\nboth by the testimony of the divine declarations, and by those very impulses of ours which they have\nin common with ourselves; and is it no argument against this rebuke that we declare the peaceful\nwisdom, whereby the contentions are corrected and healed, to be the gift of God; unbelievers are in\nsuch wise to be rebuked, as those who do not abide in the faith, without any hindrance to that rebuke\nfrom the preaching of God's grace, although that preaching commends that very grace and the\ncontinuance in it as the gifts of God.

It is the duty also of all the faithful to be ready to help the oppressed and the miserable in their distress, in order that by the manifestation of another manner of recompense (vindictoe) they may be able to keep the recompense (vengeance) of God from themselves.

There is a place, however, with God-to wit, the unity of the holy Church-in which there is a standing upon a rock, while the perfection of the confession (confessionis soliditas) is held in lowliness. We admonish thee, our brother, and all our brethren who are rulers in the Church of Christ, which He hath purchased with His blood, to keep back, by whatever checks ye possess, all men from that abyss into which some brethren are slipping, in reviling the Lord's pastors, and persecuting them both by word and deed; and we counsel you not to suffer them to be wounded with the hook of passion: for it is written, \"For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.\"[fn-92-P9287_3024804:4-nf] Hence it is said again, \"Let every man be swift to hear, but slow to speak, and slow to wrath.\"[fn-92-P9288_3024915:5-nf] Now I doubt not that with God's help you observe all these things; but as an occasion for counsel has arisen, I also secretly attach my word to your good desires and deeds, so that what you are doing of yourselves and independently of admonition you may do presently not by yourselves alone, now that the counsellor himself is added to you. Wherefore, brethren, it becomes you and all the faithful to love each other, and not to calumniate or accuse one another: for it is written, \"Love thy neighbour, and be faithful unto him. But if thou bewrayest his secrets, thou shalt follow no more after him. For as a man who destroyeth his friend, so is he that loseth the love of his neighbour. And as one that letteth a bird go out of his hand, so art thou who hast let thy neighbour go, and shalt not get him again. Follow after him no more, for he is far off. For he is as a roe escaped out of the snare, since his soul is wounded. Further thou wilt not be able to bind him up, and after reviling there may be reconcilement; but to bewray the secrets of a friend is the despair of an unhappy mind. He that winketh with the eye worketh evil, and every one will cast him off. When thou art present, he will speak sweetly, and will admire thy words. But at last he will writhe his mouth, and slander thy sayings. I have hated many things, but nothing like him; and the Lord will hate him. Whoso casteth a stone on high, it will fall upon his own head; and a deceitful stroke shall make wounds in the deceiver. Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein; and he that placeth a stone in his neighbour's way shall stumble thereon; and he that setteth a trap for another shall perish in it. He that worketh mischief, it shall fall upon him; and he shall not know whence it cometh on him. Mockery and reproach are from the proud; and vengeance, as a lion, shall lie in wait for them. They that rejoice at the fall of the righteous shall be taken in the snare; and anguish shall consume them before they die. Wrath and fury are both abominations, and the sinful man shall have them both.\"[fn-92-P9289_3027003:6-nf] \"He that desireth to be avenged shall find vengeance from the Lord, and He will surely keep his sins in remembrance. Forgive thy neighbour the hurt that he hath done thee; so shall thy sins also be forgiven thee when thou prayest. One man beareth hatred against another, and doth he seek pardon from the Lord? He showeth no mercy to a man which is like himself, and doth he ask forgiveness of his own sins from the Most High? He, though he is but flesh, nourishes hatred; and does he implore mercy from God? Who will entreat for pardon of his sins? Remember thy end, and let enmity cease. For corruption and death impend on His commandments. Remember the fear of God, and bear no malice to thy neighbour. Remember the covenant of the Highest, and wink at the ignorance of thy neighbour. Abstain from strife, and thou shalt diminish thy sins. For a furious man will kindle strife, and a sinful man will disquiet friends, and will make debate among them that be at peace. For according to the trees of the wood, so will the fire burn; and according as a man's strength is, so will his wrath be; and according to his riches, his anger will rise. An hasty contention will kindle a fire; and an hasty fighting will shed blood; and a tale-bearing (testificans) tongue will cause death. If thou blow the spark, it shall burn like a fire; and if thou spit upon it, it shall be quenched; and both these come out of thy mouth. The whisperer and double- tongued is cursed; for he has destroyed many that were at peace. A backbiting (tertia) tongue hath disquieted many, and driven them from nation to nation. Strong cities of the rich hath it pulled down, and overthrown the houses of great men. It has destroyed the strength of peoples, and has scattered strong nations. A backbiting tongue hath east out virtuous women (viratas, spirited), and deprived them of their labours. Whoso hearkeneth unto it shall never find rest, and shall never have a friend on whom he may repose. The stroke of the whip maketh marks; but the stroke of the tongue will break the bones. Many have fallen by the edge of the sword, but not so many as have fallen by the tongue. Well is he that is defended from the evil tongue, and hath not passed through the venom thereof; who hath not drawn the yoke thereof, nor hath been bound in her bands. For the yoke thereof is a yoke of iron, and the bands thereof are bands of brass. The death thereof is an evil death, and the grave were better than it. Its endurance shall not abide, but it shall possess the ways of the unrighteous. In its flame it shall not burn the righteous. Such as forsake the Lord shall fall into it; and it shall burn in them, and not be quenched; and it shall be sent upon them as a lion, and devour them as a leopard. Hedge thine ears (soe pi aures) about with thorns, and refuse to listen to the evil tongue, and make a door for thy mouth and bars for thine ears. Smelt (confla) thy gold and thy silver, and make a balance for thy words, and a right bridle for thy mouth.

To take, for example, this requirement on which Faustus ignorantly grounds his charge against the Old Testament, that a man should take his brother's wife to raise up seed for his brother, to be called by his name; what does this prefigure, but that every preacher of the gospel should so labor in the Church as to raise up seed to his deceased brother, that is, Christ, who died for us, and that this seed should bear His name? Moreover, the apostle fulfills this requirement not now in the typical observance, but in the spiritual reality, when he reproves those of whom he says that he had begotten them in Christ Jesus by the gospel,[fn-24-P2491_1507695:16-nf] and points out to them their error in wishing to be of Paul. \"Was Paul,\" he says, \"crucified for you? Or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?\"[fn-24-P2492_1507859:17-nf] As if he should say, I have begotten you for my deceased brother; your name is Christian, not Paulian. Then, too, whoever refuses the ministry of the gospel when chosen by the Church, justly deserves the contempt of the Church. So we see that the spitting in the face is accompanied with a sign of reproach in loosing a shoe from one foot, to exclude the man from the company of those to whom the apostle says, \"Let your feet be shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;\"[fn-24-P2493_1508359:18-nf] and of whom the prophet thus speaks \"How beautiful are the feet of them who publish peace, who bring good tidings ofgood!\"[fn-24-P2494_1508500:19-nf] The man who holds the faith ofthe gospel so as both to profit himself and to be ready when called to serve the Church, is properly represented as shod on both feet.

You see the orthodox method of the contest, and consider the issue of spiritual combats: how the athlete of Christ having gained a victory over the rebellious flesh, having cast it as it were under his feet, is carried forward as triumphing on high.

Then, those who have put faith in necromancers, receive from them amulets and charms, to ward off evil forsooth; and will you not allow the heavenly Word, the Saviour, to be bound on to you as an amulet, and, by trusting in God's own charm, be delivered from passions which are the diseases of the mind, and rescued from sin?-for sin is eternal death. Surely utterly dull and blind, and, like moles, doing nothing but eat, you spend your lives in darkness, surrounded with corruption.

He who obeys Him has the advantage in all things, follows God, obeys the Father, knows Him through wandering, loves God, loves his neighbour, fulfils the commandment, seeks the prize, claims the promise. But it has been God's fixed and constant purpose to save the flock of men: for this end the good God sent the good Shepherd. And the Word, having unfolded the truth, showed to men the height of salvation, that either repenting they might be saved, or refusing to obey, they might be judged. This is the proclamation of righteousness: to those that obey, glad tidings; to those that disobey, judgment. The loud trumpet, when sounded, collects the soldiers, and proclaims war. And shall not Christ, breathing a strain of peace to the ends of the earth, gather together His own soldiers, the soldiers of peace? Well, by His blood, and by the word, He has gathered the bloodless host of peace, and assigned to them the kingdom of heaven. The trumpet of Christ is His Gospel.

These are our invulnerable weapons: armed with these, let us face the evil one; \"the fiery darts of the evil one\" let us quench with the sword-points dipped in water, that, have been baptized by the Word, returning grateful thanks for the benefits we have received, and honouring God through the Divine Word. \"For while thou art yet speaking,\" it is said, \"He will say, Behold, I am beside thee.\"[fn-32-P3246_964266:167-nf] O this holy and blessed power, by which God has fellowship with men! Better far, then, is it to become at once the imitator and the servant of the best of all beings; for only by holy service will any one be able to imitate God, and to serve and worship Him only by imitating Him. The heavenly and truly divine love comes to men thus, when in the soul itself the spark of true goodness, kindled in the soul by the Divine Word, is able to burst forth into flame; and, what is of the highest importance, salvation runs parallel with sincere willingness-choice and life being, so to speak, yoked together. Wherefore this exhortation of the truth alone, like the most faithful of our friends, abides with us till our last breath, and is to the whole and perfect spirit of the soul the kind attendant on our ascent to heaven. What, then, is the exhortation I give you? I urge you to be saved. This Christ desires. In one word. He freely bestows life on you. And who is He? Briefly learn. The Word of truth, the Word of incorruption, that regenerates man by bringing him back to the truth-the goad that urges to salvation t He who expels destruction and pursues death-He who builds up the temple of God in men, that He may cause God to take up His abode in men. Cleanse the temple; and pleasures and amusements abandon to the winds and the fire, as a fading flower; but wisely cultivate the fruits of self-command, and present thyself to God as an offering of first-fruits, that there may be not the work alone, but also the grace of God; and both are requisite, that the friend of Christ may be rendered worthy of the kingdom, and be counted worthy of the kingdom.

For we are running, and running to our own country; and if we despair of attaining, by that very despair we fail. But He whose will it is that we attain, that He may keep us safe in our own land, feedeth us in the way. Hear we then: \"If we say that we have fellowship with Him and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth.\" Let us not say that we have fellowship with Him, if we walk in darkness. \"If we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another.\"[fn-39-P3986_2198339:25-nf] Let us walk in the light, as He is in the light, that we may be able to have fellowship with Him.

They came in old, they went out new. How, came in old, went out new? Old men they came in, infants they went out. For the old life is old age with all its dotage, but the new life is the infancy of regeneration. But what are we to do? The past sins are pardoned, not only to these but to us; and after the pardon and abolition of all sins, by living in this world in the midst of temptations, some haply have been contracted. Therefore what he can, let man do; let him confess himself to be what he is, that he may be cured by Him who always is what He is: for He always was and is; we were not and are.","title":"Homily I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":18,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_51_on_prayer_","source_chapter":25,"source_paragraph":"81","folder":"ANF-03","text":"In the matter of kneeling also prayer is subject to diversity of observance, through the act of some few who abstain from kneeling on the Sabbath; and since this dissension is particularly on its trial before the churches, the Lord will give His grace that the dissentients may either yield, or else indulge their opinion without offence to others.

The simple word, then, of our philosophy declares the passions to be impressions on the soul that is soft and yielding, and, as it were, the signatures of the spiritual powers with whom we have to straggle.

For if charity is God, God is capable neither of proficiency nor of deficiency: that charity is said to be making proficiency in thee, means only that thou makest proficiency in it. Ask therefore what proficiency thou hast made in charity, and what thine heart will answer thee, that thou mayest know the measure of thy profiting. For he has promised to show us in what we may know Him, and hath said, \"In this is love made perfectin us.\" Ask, in what? \"That we have boldness in the day of judgment.\" Whoso hath boldness in the day of judgment, in that man is charity made perfect. What is it to have boldness in the day of judgment? Not to fear lest the day of judgment should come. There are men who do not believe in a day of judgment; these cannot have boldness in a day which they do not believe will come. Let us pass these: may God awaken them, that they may live; why speak we of the dead? They do not believe that there will be a day of judgment; they neither fear nordesire what they do not believe. Some man has begun to believe in a day of judgment: if he has begun to believe, he has also begun to fear. But because he fears as yet, because he hath not yet boldness in the day of judgment, not yet is charity in that man made perfect. But for all that, is one to despair? In whom thou seest the beginning, why despairest thou of the end? What beginning do I see? (sayest thou.) That very fear. Hear the Scripture: \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\"[fn-45-P4563_2462586:5-nf] Well then, he has begun to fear the day of judgment: by fearing let him correct himself, let him watch against his enemies, i.e. his sins; let him begin to come to life again inwardly, and to mortify his members which are upon the earth, as the apostle saith, \"Mortify your members which are upon the earth.\"[fn-45-P4564_2462918:6-nf] By the members upon earth he means spiritual wickedness:[fn-45-P4565_2462991:7-nf] for he goes on to expound it, \"Covetousness, uncleanness,\"[fn-45-P4566_2463076:8-nf] and the rest which he there follows out. Now in proportion as this man who has begun to fear the day of judgment, mortifies his members which are upon the earth, in that proportion the heavenly members rise up and are strengthened. But the heavenly members are all good works. As the heavenly members rise up, he begins to desire that which once he feared. Once he feared lest Christ should come and find in him the impious whom He must condemn; now he longs for Him to come, because He shall find the pious man whom He may crown. Having now begun to desire Christ's coming, the chaste soul which desires the embrace of the Bridegroom renounces the adulterer, becomes a virgin within by faith, hope, and charity. Now hath the man boldness in the day of judgment: he fights not against himself when he prays, \"Thy kingdom come.\"[fn-45-P4567_2463920:9-nf] For he that fears test the kingdom of God should come, fears lest his prayer be heard. How can he be said to pray, who fears lest his prayer be heard? But he that prays with boldness of charity, wishes now that He may come. Of this same desire said one in the Psalm, \"And thou, Lord, how long? Turn, Lord, and deliver my soul.\"[fn-45-P4568_2464266:10-nf] He groaned at being so put off. For there are men who with patience submit to die; but there are some perfect who with patience endure to live. What do I mean? When a person still desires this life, that person, when the day of death comes, patiently endures death: he struggles against himself that he may follow the will of God, and in his mind desires that which God chooseth, not what man's will chooseth: from desire of the present life there comes a reluctance against death, but yet he takes to him patience and fortitude, that he may with an even mind meet death; he dies patiently. But when a man desires, as the apostle saith, \"to be dissolved and to be with Christ,\"[fn-45-P4569_2464963:11-nf] that person, not patiently dies, but patiently lives, delightedly dies. See the apostle patiently living, i.e. how with patience he here, not loves life, but endures it. \"To be dissolved,\" saith be, \"and to be with Christ, is far better: but to continue in the flesh is necessary for your sakes.\" Therefore, brethren, do your endeavor, settle it inwardly with yourselves to make this your concern, that ye may desire the day of judgment. No otherwise is charity proved to be perfect, but only when one has begun to desire that day.

Or, on the other hand, if they will take wives, and bring up children, and taste of the fruits of the earth, and partake of all the blessings of life, and bear its appointed sorrows (for nature herself hath allotted sorrows to all men; for sorrows must exist, and earth is the only place for them), then must they discharge the duties of life until they are released from its bonds, and render due honour to those beings who control the affairs of this life, if they would not show themselves ungrateful to them.

And what is the character of the arms of this centurion, and for what use in battle they are, hear the blessed Apostle declaring: \"The arms,\" he says \"of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty to God.\" He tells us their character; viz., that they are not carnal or weak, but spiritual and mighty to God. Then he next suggests in what struggles they are to be used: \"Unto the pulling down of fortifications, purging the thoughts, and every height that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every understanding unto the obedience of Christ, and having in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience shall be first fulfilled.\"[fn-44-P4426_1628570:12-nf] And since though useful, it yet belongs to another time to run through these one by one, I only want you to see the different sorts of these arms and their characteristics, as we also ought always to walk with them girt upon us if we mean to fight the Lord's battles and to serveamong the centurions of the gospel. \"Take,\" he says \"the shield of faith, wherewith ye may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one.\"[fn-44-P4427_1629016:13-nf] Faith then is that which intercepts the flaming darts of lust, and destroys them by the fear of future judgment, and belief in the heavenly kingdom. \"And the breastplate,\" he says, \"of charity.\"[fn-44-P4428_1629229:14-nf] This indeed is that which going round the vital parts of the breast and protecting what is exposed to the deadly wounds of swelling thoughts, keeps off the blows opposed to it, and does not allow the darts of the devil to penetrate to our inner man. For it \"endureth all things, suffereth all things, beareth all things.\"[fn-44-P4429_1629571:15-nf] \"And for an helmet the hope of salvation.\"[fn-44-P4430_1629635:16-nf] The helmet is what protects the head. As then Christ is our head, we ought always in all temptations and persecutions to protect it with the hope of future good things to come, and especially to keep faith in Him whole and undefiled. For it is possible for one who has lost other parts of the body, weak as he may be, still to survive: but even a short time of living is extended to no one without a head. \"And the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God.\"[fn-44-P4431_1630117:17-nf] For it is \"sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart:\"[fn-44-P4432_1630326:18-nf] as it divides and cuts off whatever carnal and earthly things it may find in us. And whosoever is protected by these arms will ever be defended from the weapons and ravages of his foes, and will not be led away bound in the chains of his spoilers, a captive and a prisoner, to the hostile land of vain thoughts, nor hear the words of the prophet: \"Why art thou grown old in a strange country?\"[fn-44-P4433_1630738:19-nf] But he will stand like a triumphant conqueror in the land of thoughts which he has chosen.

And what is the character of the arms of this centurion, and for what use in battle they are, hear the blessed Apostle declaring: \"The arms,\" he says \"of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty to God.\" He tells us their character; viz., that they are not carnal or weak, but spiritual and mighty to God. Then he next suggests in what struggles they are to be used: \"Unto the pulling down of fortifications, purging the thoughts, and every height that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every understanding unto the obedience of Christ, and having in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience shall be first fulfilled.\"[fn-44-P4426_1628570:12-nf] And since though useful, it yet belongs to another time to run through these one by one, I only want you to see the different sorts of these arms and their characteristics, as we also ought always to walk with them girt upon us if we mean to fight the Lord's battles and to serveamong the centurions of the gospel. \"Take,\" he says \"the shield of faith, wherewith ye may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one.\"[fn-44-P4427_1629016:13-nf] Faith then is that which intercepts the flaming darts of lust, and destroys them by the fear of future judgment, and belief in the heavenly kingdom. \"And the breastplate,\" he says, \"of charity.\"[fn-44-P4428_1629229:14-nf] This indeed is that which going round the vital parts of the breast and protecting what is exposed to the deadly wounds of swelling thoughts, keeps off the blows opposed to it, and does not allow the darts of the devil to penetrate to our inner man. For it \"endureth all things, suffereth all things, beareth all things.\"[fn-44-P4429_1629571:15-nf] \"And for an helmet the hope of salvation.\"[fn-44-P4430_1629635:16-nf] The helmet is what protects the head. As then Christ is our head, we ought always in all temptations and persecutions to protect it with the hope of future good things to come, and especially to keep faith in Him whole and undefiled. For it is possible for one who has lost other parts of the body, weak as he may be, still to survive: but even a short time of living is extended to no one without a head. \"And the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God.\"[fn-44-P4431_1630117:17-nf] For it is \"sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart:\"[fn-44-P4432_1630326:18-nf] as it divides and cuts off whatever carnal and earthly things it may find in us. And whosoever is protected by these arms will ever be defended from the weapons and ravages of his foes, and will not be led away bound in the chains of his spoilers, a captive and a prisoner, to the hostile land of vain thoughts, nor hear the words of the prophet: \"Why art thou grown old in a strange country?\"[fn-44-P4433_1630738:19-nf] But he will stand like a triumphant conqueror in the land of thoughts which he has chosen. Would you understand too the strength and courage of this centurion, by which he bears these arms of which we spoke before as not carnal but mighty to God? Hear of the selection by which the King himself marks and approves brave men when he summons them to the spiritual combat. \"Let,\" says He, \"the weak say that I am strong;\" and: \"Let him who is the sufferer become a warrior.\"[fn-44-P4434_1631231:20-nf] You see then that none but sufferers and weak people can fight the Lord's battles, weak indeed with that weakness, rounded on which that centurion of ours in the gospel said with confidence: \"For when I am weak, then am I strong,\" and again, \"for strength is made perfect in weakness.\"[fn-44-P4435_1631546:21-nf] Of which weakness one of the prophets says: \"And he that is weak among them shall be as the house of David.[fn-44-P4436_1631678:22-nf] For the patient sufferer shall fight these wars, with that patience of which it is said \"patience is necessary for you that doing the will of God you may receive the reward.\"[fn-44-P4437_1631872:23-nf] ","title":"VII.

But whereinsoever he has cast any revilings or calumnies against the grain itself, its faith is tried on earth, and its reward increased in the heavens.

For when we are tried by good report, whether we resist the exaltation of ourselves to pride, and are tried by evil report, whether we love even those very enemies by whom it is invented against us, then we overcome the devil by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left.

But the prince of the kingdom of the Persians resisted me one and twenty days: and behold Michael one of the chief princes came to help me, and I remained there by the king of the Persians. But I am come to teach thee what thinks shall befall thy people in the latter days.\"[fn-46-P4687_1703050:21-nf] And we can not possibly doubt that this prince of the kingdom of the Persians was a hostile power, which favoured the nation of the Persians an enemy of God's people; for in order to hinder the good which it saw would result from the solution of the question for which the prophet prayed the Lord, by the archangel, in its jealousy it opposed itself to prevent the saving comfort of the angel from reaching Daniel too speedily, and from strengthening the people of God, over which the archangel Gabriel was: and the latter said that even then, owing to the fierceness of his assaults, he would not have been able to come to him, had not Michael the archangel come to help him, and met the prince of the kingdom of the Persians, and joined battle with him, and intervened, and defended him from his attack, and so enabled him to come to instruct the prophet after twenty-one days. And a little later on it says: \"And the angel said: Dost thou know wherefore I am come to thee? And now I will return to fight against the prince of the Persians. For when I went forth, there appeared the prince of the Greeks coming. But I will tell thee what is written down in the Scriptures of truth: and none is my helper in all these things but Michael your prince.\"[fn-46-P4688_1704320:22-nf] And again: \"At that time shall Michael rise up, the great prince, who standeth for the children of thy people.\"[fn-46-P4689_1704454:23-nf] So then we read that in the same way another was called the prince of the Greeks, who since he was patron of that nation which was subject to him seems to have been opposed to the nation of the Persians as well as to the people of Israel. From which we clearly see that antagonistic powers raise against each other those quarrels of nations, and conflicts and dissensions, which they show among themselves at their instigation, and that they either exult at their victories or are cast down at theirdefeats, and thus cannot live in harmony among themselves, while each of them is always striving with restless jealousy on behalf of those whom he presides over, against the patron of some other nation.","title":"VIII.

This was Antony's first struggle against the devil, or rather this victory was the Saviour's work in Antony[fn-36-P3669_1516181:23-nf] , `Who condemned sin in the flesh that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit.' But neither did Antony, although the evil one had fallen, henceforth relax his care and despise him; nor did the enemy as though conquered tease to lay snares for him. For again he went round as a lion seeking some occasion against him. But Antony having learned from the Scriptures that the devices[fn-36-P3670_1516657:24-nf] of the devil are many, zealously continued the discipline, reckoning that though the devil had not been able to deceive his heart by bodily pleasure, he would endeavour to ensnare him by other means. For the demon loves sin. Wherefore more and more he repressed the body and kept it in subjection[fn-36-P3671_1516972:25-nf] , lest haply having conquered on one side, he should be dragged down on the other. He therefore planned to accustom himself to a severer mode of life. And many marvelled, but he himself used to bear the labour easily; for the eagerness of soul, through the length of time it had abode in him, had wrought a good habit in him, so that taking but little initiation from others he shewed great zeal in this matter. He kept vigil to such an extent that he often continued the whole night without sleep; and this not once but often, to the marvel of other. He ate once a day, after sunset, sometimes once in two days, and often even in four. His food was bread and salt, his drink, water only. Of flesh and wine it is superfluous even to speak, since no such thing was found with the other earnest men. A rush mat served him to sleep upon, but for the most part he lay upon the bare ground. He would not anoint himself with oil, saying it behoved young men to be earnest in training and not to seek what would enervate the body; but they must accustom it to labour, mindful of the Apostle's words[fn-36-P3672_1518210:26-nf] , `when I am weak, then am I strong.' `For,' said he, `the fibre of the soul is then sound when the pleasures of the body are diminished.' And he had come to this truly wonderful conclusion, 'that progress in virtue, and retirement from the world for the sake of it, ought not to be measured by time, but by desire and fixity of purpose. He at least gave no thought to the past, but day by day, as if he were at the beginning of his discipline, applied greater pains for advancement, often repeating to himself the saying of Paul[fn-36-P3673_1518761:27-nf] : `Forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before.' He was also mindful of the words spoken by the prophet Elias[fn-36-P3674_1518940:28-nf] , `the Lord liveth before whose presence I stand to-day.' For he observed that in saying `to-day' the prophet did not compute the time that had gone by: but daily as though ever commencing he eagerly endeavoured to make himself fit to appear before God, being pure in heart and ever ready to submit to His counsel, and to Him alone. And he used to say to himself that from the life of the great Elias the hermit ought to see his own as in a mirror.","title":"Life of Antony","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":6,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_38_life_of_antony","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"25","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"21.

So he was alone in the inner mountain, spending his time in prayer and discipline.

At night they saw the mountain become full of wild beasts, and him also fighting as though against visible beings, and praying against them. And those who came to him he encouraged, while kneeling he contended and prayed to the Lord. Surely it was a marvellous thing that a man, alone in such a desert, feared neither the demons who rose up against him, nor the fierceness of the four-footed beasts and creeping things, for all they were so many. But in truth, as it is written, `He trusted in the Lord as Mount Sion[fn-38-P3802_1582616:113-nf] ,' with a mind unshaken and undisturbed; so that the demons rather fled from him, and the wild beasts, as it is written[fn-38-P3803_1582756:114-nf] , `kept peace with him.'","title":"Life of Antony","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":6,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_38_life_of_antony","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"68","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"65. And many monks have related with the greatest agreement and unanimity that many other such like things were done by him. But still these do not seem as marvellous as certain other things appear to be. For once, when about to eat, having risen up to pray about the ninth hour, he perceived that he was caught up in the spirit, and, wonderful to tell, he stood and saw himself, as it were, from outside himself, and that he was led in the air by certain ones. Next certain bitter and terrible beings stood in the air and wished to hinder him from passing through. But when his conductors opposed them, they demanded whether he was not accountable to them. And when they wished to sum up the account from his birth, Antony's conductors stopped them, saying, `The Lord hath wiped out the sins from his birth, but from the time he became a monk, and devoted himself to God, it is permitted you to make a reckoning.' Then when they accused him and could not convict him, his way was free and unhindered. And immediately he saw himself, as it were, coming and standing by himself, and again he was Antony as before. Then forgetful of eating, he remained the rest of the day and through the whole of the night groaning and praying. For he was astonished when he saw against what mighty opponents our wrestling is, and by what labours we have to pass through the air. And he remembered that this is what the Apostle said, `according to the prince of the power of the air[fn-38-P3829_1599901:126-nf] .'

For if he had advanced against his foe, not with his own strength, but solely with the protection of God's grace; and, supported only by Divine aid without any virtue of patience on his own part, had borne that manifold weight of temptations and losses, contrived with all the cruelty of his foe, how would the devil have repeated with some justice that slanderous speech which he had previously uttered: \"Doth Job serve God for nought? Hast Thou not hedged him in, and all his substance round about? but take away thine hand,\" i.e., allow him to fight with me in his own strength, \"and he will curse Thee to Thy face.\"[fn-53-P5387_1927061:90-nf] But as after the struggle the slanderous foe dare not give vent to any such murmur as this, he admired that he was vanquished by his strength and not by that of God; although too we must not hold that the grace of God was altogether wanting to him, which gave to the tempter a power of tempting in proportion to that which it knew that he had of resisting, without protecting him from his attacks in such a way as to leave no room for human virtue, but only providing for this; viz., that the most fierce foe should not drive him out of his mind and overwhelm him when weakened, with unequal thoughts and in an unfair contest. But that the Lord is sometimes wont to tempt our faith that it maybe made stronger and more glorious, we are taught by the example of the centurion in the gospel, in whose case though the Lord knew that He would cure his servant by the power of His word, yet He chose to offer His bodily presence, saying: \"I will come and heal him:\" but when the centurion overcame this offer of His by the ardour of still more fervent faith, and said: \"Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed,\" the Lord marvelled at him and praised him, and put him before all those of the people of Israel who had believed, saying: \"Verily, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith in Israel.\"[fn-53-P5388_1928454:91-nf] For there would have been no ground for praise or merit, if Christ had only preferred in him what He Himself had given. And this searching trial of faith we read that the Divine righteousness brought about also in the case of the grandest of the patriarchs; where it is said: \"And it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham.\"[fn-53-P5389_1928825:92-nf] For the Divine righteousness wished to try not that faith with which the Lord had inspired him, but that which when called and enlightened by the Lord he could show forth by his own free will. Wherefore the firmness of his faith was not without reason proved, and when the grace of God, which had for a while left him to prove him, came to his aid, it was said: \"Lay not thine hand on the lad, and do nothing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest the Lord, and for my sake hast not spared thy beloved son.\"[fn-53-P5390_1929356:93-nf] And that this kind of temptation can befall us, for the sake of proving us, is sufficiently clearly foretold by the giver of the Law in Deuteronomy: \"If there rise in the midst of you a prophet or one that saith he hath seen a dream, and foretell a sign and wonder; and that come to pass which he spoke, and he say to thee: Let us go and serve strange gods which ye know not, thou shalt not hear the words of that prophet or dreamer; for the Lord your God surely trieth thee, whether thou lovest Him with all thine heart, and keepest His Commandments, or no.\"[fn-53-P5391_1929934:94-nf] What then follows? When God has permitted that prophet or dreamer to arise, must we hold that He will protect those whose faith He is purposing to try, in such a way as to leave no place for their own free will, where they can fight with the tempter with their own strength? And why is it necessary for them even to be tried if He knows them to be so weak and feeble as not to be able by their own power to resist the tempter? But certainly the Divine righteousness would not have permitted them to be tempted, unless it knew that there was within them an equal power of resistance, by which they could by an equitable judgment be found in either result either guilty or worthy of praise. To the same effect also is this which the Apostle says: \"Therefore let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall. There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man. But God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able, but will with the temptation make also a way of escape that ye may be able to bear it.\"[fn-53-P5392_1931007:95-nf] For when he says \"Let him that standeth take heed lest he fall\" he sets free will on its guard, as he certainly knew that, after grace had been received, it could either stand by its exertions or fall through carelessness. But when he adds: \"there hath no temptation taken you but what is common to man\" he chides their weakness and the frailty of their heart that is not yet strengthened, as they could not yet resist the attacks of the hosts of spiritual wickedness, against which he knew that he and those who were perfect daily fought; of which also he says to the Ephesians: \"For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against spiritual wickedness in heavenly places.\"[fn-53-P5393_1931792:96-nf] But when he subjoins: \"But God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able,\" he certainly is not hoping that the Lord will not suffer them to be tempted, but that they may not be tempted above what they are able to bear. For the one shows the power of man's will, the other denotes the grace of the Lord who moderates the violence of temptations. In all these phrases then there is proof that Divine grace ever stirs up the will of man, not so as to protect and defend it in all things in such a way as to cause it not to fight by its own efforts against its spiritual adversaries, the victor over whom may set it down to God's grace, and the vanquished to his own weakness, and thus learn that his hope is always not in his own courage but in the Divine assistance, and that he must ever fly to his Protector. And to prove this not by our own conjecture but by still clearer passages of Holy Scripture let us consider what we read in Joshuah the son of Nun: \"The Lord,\" it says, \"left these nations and would not destroy them, that by them He might try Israel, whether they would keep the commandments of the Lord their God, and that they might learn to fight with their enemies.\"[fn-53-P5394_1933022:97-nf] And if we may illustrate the incomparable mercy of our Creator from something earthly, not as being equal in kindness, but as an illustration of mercy: if a tender and anxious nurse carries an infant in her bosom for a long time in order sometime to teach it to walk, and first allows it to crawl, then supports it that by the aid of her right hand it may lean on its alternate steps, presently leaves it for a little and if she sees it tottering at all, catches hold of it, and grabs at it when falling, when down picks it up, and either shields it from a fall, or allows it to fall lightly, and sets it up again after a tumble, but when she has brought it up to boyhood or the strength of youth or early manhood, lays upon it some burdens or labours by which it may be not overwhelmed but exercised, and allows it to vie with those of its own age; how much more does the heavenly Father of all know whom to carry in the bosom of His grace, whom to train to virtue in His sight by the exercise of free will, and yet He helps him in his efforts, hears him when he calls, leaves him not when he seeks Him, and sometimes snatches him from peril even without his knowing it.","title":"XIII.

Further that the grandeur of perfection was open to every age and either sex, and that all the members of the Church were urged to scale the heights of heavenly goodness when the Apostle said: \"So run that ye may obtain;\"[fn-63-P6349_2265571:23-nf] nor should those who were ready and eager for it hang back because of the delays of the slow and dawdlers, as it is better for the sluggards to be urged on by those running before than for those who are doing their best to be hampered by the slothful. Further that he had determined and made up his mind to renounce the world and to die to the world that he might live to God, and that if he could not attain this happiness; viz., to pass with his wife into union with Christ, he would rather be saved even with the loss of one member, and enter into the kingdom of heaven as one maimed rather than be condemned with his body whole. But he also added and spoke as follows: If Moses suffered wives to be divorced for the hardness of their hearts, why should not Christ allow this for the desire of chastity, especially when the same Lord among those other affections; viz., for fathers and mothers and children (all due regard to which not only the law but He Himself also charged to be shown, yet for His name's sake and for the desire of perfection He decreed that they should not simply be disregarded but actually hated)-to these, I say, He joined also the mention of wives, saying: \"And everyone that hath left house, or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children for My name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold and shall inherit eternal life.\"[fn-63-P6350_2266958:24-nf] So far then is He from allowing anything to be set against that perfection which He is proclaiming, that He actually enjoins that the ties to father and mother should be broken and disregarded out of love for Him, though according to the Apostle it is the first commandment with promise; viz., \"Honour thy father and thy mother, which is the first commandment with promise, that it may be well with thee and that thy days may be long upon earth.\"[fn-63-P6351_2267428:25-nf] And as the word of the gospel condemns those who break the chains of matrimony where there has been no sin of adultery, so it clearly promises a reward of an hundredfold to those who have cast off a carnal yoke out of love for Christ and the desire for chastity. Wherefore if it can be brought about that you may listen to reason and be turned together with me to this most desirable choice; viz., that we should together serve the Lord and escape the pains of hell, I will not refuse the affection of marriage, nay I will embrace it with a still greater love. For I acknowledge and honour my helpmeet assigned to me by the word of the Lord, and I do not refuse to be joined to her in an unbroken tie of love in Christ, nor do I separate from me what the Lord joined to me by the law of the original condition,[fn-63-P6352_2268260:26-nf] if only you yourself will be what your Maker meant you to be. But if you will not be a helpmeet, but prefer to make yourself a deceiver and an assistance not to me but to the adversary, and fancy that the sacrament of matrimony was granted to you for this reason that you may deprive yourself of this salvation which is offered to you, and also hold me back from following the Saviour as a disciple, then I will resolutely lay hold on the words which were uttered by the lips of Abbot John, or rather of Christ Himself, so that no carnal affection may be able to tear me away from spiritual blessings, for He says: \"He that hateth not father and mother and children and brothers and sisters and wife and lands, yea and his own soul also, cannot be My disciple.\"[fn-63-P6353_2269044:27-nf] When then by these and such like words the woman's purpose was not moved and she persisted in the same obstinate hardness, If, said the blessed Theonas, I cannot drag you away from death, neither shall you separate me from Christ: but it is safer for me to be divorced from a human person than from God. And so by the aid of God's grace he at once set about the execution of his purpose and suffered not the ardour of his desire to grow cool through any delay. For at once he stripped himself of all his worldly goods, and fled to a monastery, where in a very short time he was so famous for the splendour of his sanctity and humility that when John of blessed memory departed this life to the Lord, and the holy Elias, a man who was no less great than his predecessor, had likewise died, Theonas was chosen by the judgment of all as the third to succeed them in the administration of the almsgiving.","title":"XXI.

But the Lord Christ when He is preparing men for the Gospel, will have no excuse from this carnal and temporal affection interfere. It is true that both the law of God prescribes these duties, and the Lord Himself reproves the Jews, because they destroyed this very commandment of God. And the Apostle Paul has in his Epistle laid it down, and said, \"This is the first commandment with promise.\" What? \"Honour thy father and thy mother.\"[fn-52-P5227_2225426:7-nf] God of a surety spake it.

A father must be honoured, but God must be obeyed. He that begat us must be loved, but He that created us must be preferred. \"I am calling thee,\" saith He, \"to My Gospel; I have need of thee for another work: this is a greater work than that which thou wishest to be doing. `Let the dead bury their dead.'[fn-52-P5228_2225954:8-nf] Thy father is dead: there are other dead men to bury the dead.\" Who are the dead who bury the dead?

Yet they do lay him out, and carry, and bewail him, and they are dead; because they are unbelievers. That which is written in the Song of Songs is a lesson to us, when the Church says, \"Set in order love in me.\"[fn-52-P5229_2226449:9-nf] What is, \"Set in order love in me\"? Make the proper degrees, and render to each what is his due. Do not put what should come before, below that which should come after it. Love your parents, but prefer God to them.

Virtues exist in us also by nature, and the soul has affinity with them not by education, but by nature herself.

Now all vice is a sickness of the sold as virtue is its health. Thus those have defined health well who have called it a regularity in the discharge of natural functions; a definition that can be applied without fear to the good condition of the soul. Thus, without having need of lessons, the soul can attain by herself to what is fit and conformable to nature.[fn-25-P2510_839035:20-nf] Hence it comes that temperance everywhere is praised, justice is in honour, courage admired, and prudence the object of all aims; virtues which concern the soul more than health concerns the body.

But let us pass on to the meaning, and henceforth leaving the figure at a distance, come to the truth, and look upon the priestly trumpets of our Saviour, which cry out, and call us, at one time to war, as the blessed Paul saith; `We wrestle not with flesh and blood, but with principalities, with powers, with the rulers of this dark world with wicked spirits in heaven[fn-88-P8812_3238946:18-nf] .'

For the secular contest men are trained and prepared, and reckon it a great glory of their honour if it should happen to them to be crowned in the sight of the people, and in the presence of the emperor. Behold a lofty and great contest, glorious also with the reward of a heavenly crown, inasmuch as God looks upon us as we struggle, and, extending His view over those whom He has condescended to make His sons, He enjoys the spectacle of our contest. God looks upon us in the warfare, and fighting in the encounter of faith; His angels look on us, and Christ looks on us. How great is the dignity, and how great the happiness of the glory, to engage in the presence of God, and to be crowned, with Christ for a judge! Let us be armed, beloved brethren, with our whole strength, and let us be prepared for the struggle with an uncorrupted mind, with a sound faith, with a devoted courage. Let the camp of God go forth to the battle-field which is appointed to us. Let the sound ones be armed, lest he that is sound should lose the advantage of having lately stood; let the lapsed also be armed, that even the lapsed may regain what he has lost: let honour provoke the whole; let sorrow provoke the lapsed to the battle.

By such doctrine ye do, indeed, bring forth from the same fountain both sweet water and bitter,-a thing which can in no possible way be either done or apprehended. For who ought to be believed? Should it be those masters of yours whose enjoyment is in the flesh, and who pamper themselves with the richest delights; or our Saviour Jesus Christ, who says, as it is written in the book of the Gospels, \"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit,\"[fn-33-P3351_877114:101-nf] and who in another place assures us that the \"father of the devil[fn-33-P3352_877202:102-nf] is a liar and a murderer from the beginning,\"[fn-33-P3353_877271:103-nf] and tells us again that men's desire was for the darkness,[fn-33-P3354_877352:104-nf] so that they would not follow that Word that had been sent forth in the beginning from the light,[fn-33-P3355_877491:105-nf] and (once more shows us) the man who is the enemy of the same, the sower of tares,[fn-33-P3356_877871:106-nf] and the god and prince of the age of this world, who blinds the minds of men that they may not be obedient to the truth in the Gospel of Christ?[fn-33-P3357_878039:107-nf] Is that God good who has no wish that the men who are his own should be saved?

To him, certainly, these must be carried back, for all ills of this kind are generated by him. But those things also which are written in the prophets and the law are none the less to be ascribed to him; for he it is who spake then in the prophets, introducing into their minds very many ignorant notions of God, as well as temptations and passions. They, too, set forth that devourer of blood and flesh; and to that Satan and to his prophets all these things properly pertain which he wished to transfer[fn-33-P3359_879243:109-nf] to the Father of Christ, prepared as he was to write a few things in the way of truth, that by means of these he might also gain credence for those other statements of his which are false. Hence it is well for us to receive nothing at all of all those things which have been written of old even down to John, and indeed to embrace only the kingdom of heaven, which has been preached in the Gospel since his days; for they verily but made a mockery of themselves, introducing as they did things ridiculous and ludicrous, keeping some small words given in obscure outline in the law, but not understanding that, if good things are mixed up with evil, the result is, that by the corruption of these evil things, even those others which are good are destroyed. And if, indeed, there is any one who may prove himself able to demonstrate that the law upholds the right, that law ought to be kept; but if we can show it to be evil, then it ought to be done away with and rejected, inasmuch as it contains the ministration of death, which was graven,[fn-33-P3360_880308:110-nf] which also covered and destroyed the glory on the countenance of Moses.[fn-33-P3361_880399:111-nf] It is a thing not without peril, therefore, for any one of you to teach the New Testament along with the law and the prophets, as if they were of one and the same origin; for the knowledge of our Saviour renews the one from day to day, while the other grows old and infirm, and passes almost into utter destruction.[fn-33-P3362_880737:112-nf] And this is a fact manifest to those who are capable of exercising discernment. For just as, when the branches of a tree become aged, or when the trunk ceases to bear fruit any more, they are cut down; and just as, when the members of the body suffer mortification, they are amputated, for the poison of the mortification diffuses itself from these members through the whole body, and unless some remedy be found for the disease by the skill of the physician, the whole body will be vitiated; so, too, if ye receive the law without understanding its origin, ye will ruin your souls, and lose your salvation.

And in what sense the devil is to be understood as the prince of the world, is still more clearly unfolded by the Apostle Paul, who, after saying, \"We wrestle not against flesh and blood,\" that is, against men, went on to say, \"but against principalities and powers, and the world-rulers of this darkness.\"[fn-28-P2858_1649753:9-nf] For in the very next word he has explained what he meant by \"world,\" when he added, \"of this darkness;\" so that no one, by the name of the world, should understand the whole creation, of which in no sense are fallen angels the rulers. \"Of this darkness,\" he says, that is, of the lovers of this world: of whom, nevertheless, there were some elected, not from any deserving of their own, but by the grace of God, to whom he says, \"Ye were sometimes darkness; but now are ye light in the Lord.\"[fn-28-P2859_1650360:10-nf] For all have been under the rulers of this darkness, that is, [under the rulers] of wicked men, or darkness, as it were, in subjection to darkness: but \"thanks be to God, who hath delivered us,\" says the same apostle, \"from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of the Son of His love.\"[fn-28-P2860_1650688:11-nf] And in Him the prince of this world, that is, of this darkness, had nothing; for neither did He come with sin as God, nor had His flesh any hereditary taint of sin in its procreation by the Virgin. And, as if it were said to Him, Why, then, dost Thou die, if Thou hast no sin to merit the punishment of death? He immediately added, \"But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do: arise, let us go hence.\" For He was sitting at table with those who were similarly occupied. But \"let us go,\" He said, and whither, but to the place where He, who had nothing in Him deserving of death, was to be delivered up to death? But He had the Father's commandment to die, as the very One of whom it had been foretold, \"Then I paid for that which I took not away;\"[fn-28-P2861_1651518:12-nf] and so appointed to pay death to the full, while owing it nothing, and to redeem us from the death that was our due. For Adam had seized on sin as a prey, when, deceived, he presumptuously stretched forth his hand to the tree, and attempted to invade the incommunicable name of that Godhead I which was disallowed him, and with which the Son of God was endowed by nature, and not by robbery.","title":"Tractate LXXIX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_230_book_iii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"172","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"\nEpistle LXVII.

For I think that thou hast not any wisdom, and art not able to accomplish any work of power. Paul answered: Dost thou suppose that I ought to speak against a desperate man. a magician, who has given his soul up to death, whose destruction and perdition will come speedily? For he ought to speak who pretends to be what he is not, and deceives men by magic art. If thou consentest to hear his words, and to shield him, thou shalt destroy thy soul and thy kingdom, for he is a most base man. And as the Egyptians Jannes and Jambres led Pharaoh and his army astray until they were swallowed up in the sea, so also he, through the instruction of his father the devil, persuades men to do many evils to themselves, and thus deceives many of the innocent, to the peril of thy kingdom. But as for the word of the devil, which I see has been poured out through this man, with groanings of my heart am dealing with the Holy Spirit, that it may clearly shown what it is; for as far as he seems to raise himself towards heaven, so far will he be sunk down into the depth of Hades, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth.

If we ought to advance our argument yet further, and turn our inspection to higher themes, let us contemplate the divine nature of the Holy Spirit specially flora the following point of view. In Scripture we find mention of three creations. The first is the evolution from non-being into being.[fn-27-P2734_922103:72-nf] The second is change from the worse to the better. The third is the resurrection of the dead. In these you will find the Holy Ghost cooperating with the Father and the Son. There is a bringing into existence of the heavens; and what says David? \"By the word of the Lord were the heavens made and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth.\"[fn-27-P2735_922884:73-nf] Again, man is created through baptism, for \"if any man be in Christ he is a new creature.\"[fn-27-P2736_923038:74-nf] And why does the Saviour say to the disciples, \"Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost\"? Here too you see the Holy Ghost present with the Father and the Son. And what would you say also as to the resurrection of the dead when we shall have failed and returned to our dust? Dust we are and unto dust we shall return.[fn-27-P2737_923451:75-nf] And He will send the Holy Ghost and create us and renew the face of the earth.[fn-27-P2738_923553:76-nf] For what the holy Paul calls resurrection David describes as renewal. Let us hear, once more, him who was caught into the third heaven. What does he say? \"You are the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you.\"[fn-27-P2739_923786:77-nf] Now every temple[fn-27-P2740_923823:78-nf] is a temple of God, and if we are a temple of the Holy Ghost, then the Holy Ghost is God. It is also called Solomon's temple, but this is in the sense of his being its builder. And if we are a temple of the Holy Ghost in this sense, then the Holy Ghost is God, for \"He that built all things is God.\"[fn-27-P2741_924303:79-nf] If we are a temple of one who is worshipped, and who dwells in us, let us confess Him to be God, for thou shale worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shall thou serve.[fn-27-P2742_924490:80-nf] Supposing them to object to the word \"God,\" let them learn what this word means. God is called Qeo\\j either because He placed (teqeike/nai) all things or because He beholds (Qea=sqai) all things. If He is called Qeo\\j because He \"placed\" or \"beholds\" all things, and the Spirit knoweth all the things of God, as the Spirit in us knoweth our things, then the Holy Ghost is God.[fn-27-P2743_924902:81-nf] Again, if the sword of the spirit is the word of God,[fn-27-P2744_925167:82-nf] then the Holy Ghost is God, inasmuch as the sword belongs to Him of whom it is also called the word. Is He named the right hand of the Father? For \"the right hand of the Lord bringeth mighty things to pass;\"[fn-27-P2745_925393:83-nf] and \"thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.\"[fn-27-P2746_925532:84-nf] But the Holy Ghost is the finger of God, as it is said \"if I by the finger of God cast out devils,\"[fn-27-P2747_925648:85-nf] of which the version in another Gospel is \"if I by the Spirit of God cast out devils.\"[fn-27-P2748_925753:86-nf] So the Holy Ghost is of the same nature as the Father and the Son.","title":"Letter VIII","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":6,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_262_letter_ccxliv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"3.
