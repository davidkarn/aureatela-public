Some time after, I saw her bathe in the river Tiber; and I gave her my hand, and drew her out of the river. The sight of her beauty made me think with myself, \"I should be a happy man if I could but get a wife as handsome and good as she is.\" This was the only thought that passed through me: this and nothing more. A short time after this, as I was walking on my road to the villages,[fn-2-P213_24827:2-nf] and magnifying the creatures of God, and thinking how magnificent, and beautiful, and powerful they are,[fn-2-P214_25409:3-nf] I fell asleep. And the Spirit carried me away, and took me through a pathless place,[fn-2-P215_25549:4-nf] through which a man could not travel, for it was situated in the midst of rocks; it was rugged and impassible on account of water. Having passed over this river, I came to a plain. I then bent down on my knees, and began to pray to the Lord[fn-2-P216_25888:5-nf] and to confess my sins. And as I prayed, the heavens were opened, and I see the woman whom I had desired saluting me from the sky, and saying, \"Hail, Hermas!\" And looking up to her, I said, \"Lady, what doest thou here? \"And she answered me, \"I have been taken up here to accuse you of your sins before the Lord.\" \"Lady,\" said I, \"are you to be the subject of my accusation? \"[fn-2-P217_26290:6-nf] \"No,\" said she; \"but hear the words which I am going to speak to you. God, who dwells in the heavens, and made out of nothing the things that exist, and multiplied and increased them on account of His holy Church,[fn-2-P218_26592:7-nf] is angry with you for having sinned against me.\" I answered her, \"Lady, have I sinned against you? How?[fn-2-P219_26718:8-nf] or when spoke I an unseemly word to you? Did I not always think of you as a lady? Did I not always respect you as a sister? Why do you falsely accuse me of this wickedness and impurity? \"With a smile she replied to me, \"The desire of wickedness[fn-2-P220_26997:9-nf] arose within your heart. Is it not your opinion that a righteous man commits sin when an evil desire arises in his heart? There is sin in such a case, and the sin is great,\" said she; \"for the thoughts of a righteous man should be righteous. For by thinking righteously his character is established in the heavens,[fn-2-P221_27400:10-nf] and he has the Lord merciful to him in every business. But such as entertain wicked thoughts in their minds are bringing upon themselves death and captivity; and especially is this the case with those who set their affections on this world,[fn-2-P222_28033:11-nf] and glory in their riches, and look not forward to the blessings of the life to come. For many will their regrets be; for they have no hope, but have despaired of themselves and their life.[fn-2-P223_28256:12-nf] But do thou pray to God, and He will heal thy sins, and the sins of thy whole house, and of all the saints.\"[fn-2-P224_28665:13-nf] ","title":"Vision First","author":"The Pastor of Hermas"},{"chapter":2,"verse":12,"source_code":"anf_07_anf07_07_book_iv_of_true_wisdom_and_religion_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"75","folder":"ANF-07","text":"When the Jews often resisted wholesome precepts, and departed from the divine law, going astray to the impious worship of false gods, then God filled just and chosen men with the Holy Spirit, appointing them as prophets in the midst of the people, by whom He might rebuke with threatening words the sins of the ungrateful people, and nevertheless exhort them to repent of their wickedness; for unless they did this, and, laying aside their vanities, return to their God, it would come to pass that He would change His covenant,[fn-12-P1247_546585:80-nf] that is, bestow[fn-12-P1248_546662:81-nf] the inheritance of eternal life upon foreign nations, and collect to Himself a more faithful people out of those who were aliens[fn-12-P1249_546820:82-nf] by birth.

He shall build me a house for my name, and I will set up His throne for ever; and I will be to Him for a father, and He shall be to me for a son; and His house shall be established,[fn-13-P1320_570070:142-nf] and His kingdom for ever.\" But the reason why the Jews did not understand these things was this, because Solomon the son of David built a temple for God, and the city which he called from his own name, Jerusalem.[fn-13-P1321_570349:143-nf] Therefore they referred the predictions of the prophets to him. Now Solomon received the government of the kingdom from his father himself. But the prophets spoke of Him who was then born after that David had slept with his fathers. Besides, the reign of Solomon was not everlasting; for he reigned forty years. In the next place, Solomon was never called the son of God, but the son of David; and the house which he built was not firmly established,[fn-13-P1322_571099:144-nf] as the Church, which is the true temple of God, which does not consist of walls, but of the heart[fn-13-P1323_571239:145-nf] and faith of the men who believe on Him, and are called faithful. But that temple of Solomon, inasmuch as it was built by the hand, fell by the hand. Lastly, his father, in the cxxvith Psalm, prophesied in this manner respecting the works of his son:[fn-13-P1324_571566:146-nf] \"Except the Lord build the house, they have laboured in vain that built it; except the Lord keep the city, the watchman hath waked but in vain.\"","title":"Book IV.

But Mesopotamia, he says, is the current of the great ocean flowing from the midst of the Perfect Man; and he was astonished at the celestial gate, exclaiming, \"How terrible is this place! it is nought else than the house of God, and this (is) the gate of heaven.\"[fn-10-P1055_278451:87-nf] On account of this, he says, Jesus uses the words, \"I am the true gate.\"[fn-10-P1056_278548:88-nf] Now he who makes these statements is, he says, the Perfect Man that is imaged from the unportrayable one from above. The Perfect Man therefore cannot, he says, be saved, unless, entering in through this gate, he be born again. But this very one the Phrygians, he says, call also Papa, because he tranquillized all things which, prior to his manifestation, were confusedly and dissonantly moved. For the name, he says, of Papa belongs simultaneously to all creatures[fn-10-P1057_279046:89-nf] -celestial, and terrestrial, and infernal-who exclaim, Cause to cease, cause to cease the discord of the world, and make \"peace for those that are afar off,\" that is, for material and earthly beings; and \"peace for those that are near,\"[fn-10-P1058_279383:90-nf] that is, for perfect men that are spiritual and endued with reason. But the Phrygians denominate this same also \"corpse\"-buried in the body, as it were, in a mausoleum and tomb.

For this, he says, is the Resurrection that takes place through the gate of heaven, through which, he says, all those that do not enter remain dead. These same Phrygians, however, he says, affirm again that this very (man), as a consequence of the change, (becomes) a god. For, he says, he becomes a god when, having risen from the dead, he will enter into heaven through a gate of this kind. Paul the apostle, he says, knew of this gate, partially opening it in a mystery, and stating \"that he was caught up by an angel, and ascended as far as the second and third heaven into paradise itself; and that he beheld sights and heard unspeakable words which it would not be possible for man to declare.\"[fn-10-P1061_280630:93-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Hippolytus"},{"chapter":2,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"628","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"6.

This remarkable man was the ablest pre-Nicene representative of Adoptionist Monarchianism. The Man Jesus was inhabited by the `Word,' i.e. by an impersonal power of God, distinct from the Logoj or reason (wisdom) inherent in God as an attribute, which descended upon him at His Baptism. His union with God, a union of Will, was unswerving, and by virtue of it He overcame the sin of mankind, worked miracles, and entered on a condition of Deification. He is God ek prokophj (cf. Luke ii. 52) by virtue of progress in perfection. That is in brief the system of Paul, and we cannot wonder at his deposition. For the striking points of contact with Arianism (two `Wisdoms,' two `Words,' prokoph: cf. Orat. c. Ar. i. 5, &c.) we have to account[fn-3-P309_131540:23-nf] . The theology of Arius is a compromise between the Origenist doctrine of the Person of Christ and the pure Monarchian Adoptionism of Paul of Samosata; or rather it engrafts the former upon the latter as the foundation principle, seriously modifying each to suit the necessity of combining the two. This compromise was not due to Arius himself but to his teacher, Lucian the Martyr. A native himself of Samosata, he stood in some relation of attachment (not clearly defineable) to Paul. Under him, he was at the head of a critical, exegetical, and theological school at Antioch. Upon the deposition of Paul he appears not so much to have been formally excommunicated as to have refused to acquiesce in the new order of things. Under Domnus and his two successors, he was in a state of suspended communion[fn-3-P310_133459:24-nf] ; but eventually was reconciled with the bishop (Cyril?) and died as a martyr at Nicomedia, Jan. 7, 312. The latter fact, his ascetic life, and his learning secured him widespread honour in the Church; his pupils formed a compact and enthusiastic brotherhood, and filled many of the most influential Sees after the persecution. That such a man should be involved in the reproach of having given birth to Arianism is an unwelcome result of history, but one not to be evaded[fn-3-P311_134199:25-nf] . The history of the Lucianic compromise and its result in the Lucianic type of theology, are both matters of inference rather than of direct knowledge. As to the first, whatever evidence there is connects Lucian's original position with Paul. His reconciliation with Bishop Cyril must have involved a reapproachment to the formula of the bishops who deposed Paul,-a thoroughly Origenist document. We may therefore suppose that the identification of Christ with the Logos, or cosmic divine principle, was adopted by him from Origenist sources. But he could not bring himself to admit that He was thus essentially identified with God the eternal; he held fast to the idea of prokoph as the path by which the Lord attained to Divinity; he distinguished the Word or Son who was Christ from the immanent impersonal Reason or Wisdom of God, as an offspring of the Father's Will, an idea which he may have derived straight from Origen, with whom of course it had a different sense. For to Origen Will was the very essence of God; Lucian fell back upon an arid philosophical Monotheism, upon an abstract God fenced about with negations (Harnack 2[fn-3-P312_136238:26-nf] , 195, note) and remote from the Universe.

The `duke' appears to have been either unable for a time, or to have thought it needless, to take possession of the churches; but we hear of a violent dispersion of worshippers from the neighbourhood of the cemetery on Easter Day (p. 249, cf. the Virgins after Syrianus but before Heraclius, p. 288); while throughout Egypt subscription to an Arianising formula was being enforced on the bishops under pain of expulsion. After Easter, a change of governor took place, Maximus of Nicaea (pp. 301 sqq., 247) being succeeded by Cataphronius, who reached Alexandria on the 10th of June (Hist. Aceph. iv.). He was accompanied by a Count Heraclius, who brought a letter from Constantius threatening the heathen with severe measures (pp. 288, 290), unless active hostilities against the Athanasian party were begun (this letter was not the one given p. 249; Ath. rightly remarks `it reflected great discredit upon the writer'). Heraclius announced that by Imperial order the Churches were to be given up to the Arians, and compelled all the magistrates, including the functionaries of heathen temples, to sign an undertaking to execute the Imperial incitements to persecution, and to agree to receive as Bishop the Emperor's nominee. These incredible precautions shew the general esteem for Athanasius even outside the Church, and the misgivings felt at Court as to the reception of the new bishop. The Gentiles reluctantly agreed, and the next acts of violence were carried out with their aid, `or rather with that of the more abandoned among them' (p. 291). On the fourth day from the arrival of Cataphronius, that is in the early hours of Thursday, June 13, after a service (which had began overnight, pp. 290, 256 fin., Hist. Aceph. v.), just as all the congregation except a few women had left, the church of Theonas was stormed and violences perpetrated which left far behind anything that Syrianus had done. Women were murdered, the church wrecked and polluted with the very worst orgies of heathenism, houses and even tombs were ransacked throughout the city and suburbs on pretence of `seeking for Athanasius.' Sebastian the Manichee, who about this time succeeded to the military command of Syrianus, appears to have carried on these outrages with the utmost zest (yet see Hist. Ar. 60). Many more bishops were driven into exile (compare the twenty-six of p. 297 with the `sixteen' p. 248, but some may belong to a still later period, see p. 257), and the Arian bishops and clergy installed, including the bitterly vindictive Secundus in Libya (p. 257). The formal transfer of churches at Alexandria took place on Saturday, June 15 (infr., p. 290, note 9): the anniversary of Eutychius (p. 292) was kept at Alexandria on July II, (Martyrol. Vetust. Ed. 1668). After a further delay of `eight months and eleven days' George, the new bishop, made his appearance (Feb. 24, 357[fn-4-P451_300292:73-nf] , third Friday in Lent). His previous career[fn-4-P452_304172:74-nf] and character[fn-4-P453_304922:75-nf] were strange qualifications for the second bishopric in Christendom. He had been a pork-contractor at Constantinople, and according to his many enemies a fraudulent one; he had amassed considerable wealth, and was a zealous Arian. His violent temper perhaps recommended him as a man likely to crush the opposition that was expected. The history of his episcopate may be briefly disposed of here. He entered upon his See in Lent, 357, with an armed force. At Easter he renewed the violent persecution of bishops, clergy, virgins, and lay people. In the week after Pentecost he let loose the cruel commandant Sebastian against a number of persons who were worshipping at the cemetery instead of communicating with himself; many were killed, and many more banished. The expulsion of bishops (`over thirty,' p. 257, cf. other reff. above) was continued (the various data of Ath. are not easy to reconcile, the first 16 of p. 257 may be the `sixteen' of p. 248, before Easter, 356: we miss the name of Scrapion in all the lists 1) Theodore, Bishop of Oxyrynchus, the largest town of middle Egypt, upon submitting to George, was compelled by him to submit to reordination. The people refused to have anything more to do with him, and did without a bishop for a long time, until they obtained a pastor in one Heraclides, who is said to have become a `Luciferian.' (Cf. Lib. Prec., and Le Quien ii. p. 578.) George carried on his tyranny eighteen months, till Aug. 29, 358. His fierce insults against Pagan worship were accompanied by the meanest and most oppressive rapacity. At last the populace, exasperated by his `adder's bites' (Ammian.), attacked him, and he was rescued with difficulty. On Oct. 2 he left the town, and the party of Athanasius expelled his followers from the churches on Oct. 11, but on Dec. 24, Sebastian came in from the country and restored the churches to the people of George. On June 23, 359, `the notary Paul' (`in complicandis calumniarum nexibus artifex dirus, unde ei Catenae inditum est cognomentum,' Ammian. Marc. XIV. v., XV. iii.), the Jeffreys of the day, held a commission of blood, and. `vindictively punished many[fn-4-P454_307855:76-nf] .' George was at this time busy with the councils of Seleucia and Constantinople (he was not actually present at the latter, Thdt. H. E. ii. 28), and was in no hurry to return. At last, just after the death of Constantius, he ventured back, Nov. 26, 361, but on the proclamation of Julian on Nov. 30 was seized by the populace and thrown into chains; on Dec. 24, `impatient of the tedious forms of judicial proceedings,' the people dragged him from prison and lynched him with the utmost ignominy.","title":"Prolegomena","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_10_disputation_of_the_first_day_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"Fortunatus said: This is my point, that He wished to prevent it, not rashly, but by power and prescience.

For He is our peace, who made both one, and breaking down the middle wall of partition, the enmities in His flesh, making void by His decrees the law of commandments, that in Himself He might unite the two into one new man, making peace, that He might reconcile them both in one body unto God through the cross, slaying the enmities in Himself.

God forbid that he who thus interprets (the passage) be wittingly ensnaring himself! But it is manifest that this scripture points to those believers who may have been found by the grace of God in (the state of) Gentile matrimony; according to the words themselves: \"If,\" it says, \"any believer has an unbelieving wife; \"it does not say, \"takes an unbelieving wife.\" It shows that it is the duty of one who, already living in marriage with an unbelieving woman,[fn-8-P852_204603:10-nf] has presently been by the grace of God converted, to continue with his wife; for this reason, to be sure, in order that no one, after attaining to faith, should think that he must turn away from a woman[fn-8-P853_204821:11-nf] who is now in some sense an \"alien\" and \"stranger.\"[fn-8-P854_204886:12-nf] Accordingly he subjoins withal a reason, that \"we are called in peace unto the Lord God; \"and that \"the unbeliever may, through the use of matrimony, be gained by the believer.\"[fn-8-P855_205092:13-nf] The very closing sentence of the period confirms (the supposition) that this is thus to be understood. \"As each,\" it says, \"is called by the Lord, so let him persevere.\"[fn-8-P856_205348:14-nf] But it is Gentiles who \"are called,\" I take it, not believers.

If, however, he had given such a permission, he would never have subjoined a declaration so diverse from and contrary to his own permission, saying: \"The woman, when her husband is dead, is free: let her marry whom. she wishes, only in the Lord.\"[fn-8-P857_205928:15-nf] Here, at all events, there is no need for reconsidering; for what there might have been reconsideration about, the Spirit has oracularly declared. For fear we should make an ill use of what he says, \"Let her marry whom she wishes,\" he has added, \"only in the Lord,\" that is, in the name of the Lord, which is, undoubtedly, \"to a Christian.\" That \"Holy Spirit,\"[fn-8-P858_206324:16-nf] therefore, who prefers that widows and unmarried women should persevere in their integrity, who exhorts us to a copy[fn-8-P859_206564:17-nf] of himself, prescribes no other manner of repeating marriage except \"in the Lord: \"to this condition alone does he concede the foregoing[fn-8-P860_206796:18-nf] of continence. \"Only,\" he says, \"in the Lord: \"he has added to his law a weight-\"only.\" Utter that word with what tone and manner you may, it is weighty: it both bids and advises; both enjoins and exhorts; both asks and threatens. It is a concise,[fn-8-P861_207061:19-nf] brief sentence; and by its own very brevity, eloquent. Thus is the divine voice wont (to speak), that you may instantly understand, instantly observe. For who but could understand that the apostle foresaw many dangers and wounds to faith in marriages of this kind, which he prohibits? sad that he took precaution, in the first place, against the defilement of holy flesh in Gentile flesh? At this point some one says, \"What, then, is the difference between him who is chosen by the Lord to Himself in (the state of) Gentile marriage, and him who was of old (that is, before marriage) a believer, that they should not be equally cautious for their flesh?-whereas the one is kept from marriage with an unbeliever, the other bidden to continue in it. Why, if we are defiled by a Gentile, is not the one disjoined, just as the other is not bound? \"I will answer, if the Spirit give (me ability); alleging, before all (other arguments), that the Lord holds it more pleasing that matrimony should not be contracted, than that it should at all be dissolved: in short, divorce He prohibits, except for the cause of fornication; but continence He commends. Let the one, therefore, have the necessity of continuing; the other, further, even the power of not marrying. Secondly, if, according to the Scripture, they who shall be \"apprehended\"[fn-8-P862_208444:20-nf] by the faith in (the state of) Gentile marriage are not defiled (thereby) for this reason, that, together with themselves, others[fn-8-P863_208621:21-nf] also are sanctified: without doubt, they who have been sanctified before marriage, if they commingle themselves with \"strange flesh,\"[fn-8-P864_208780:22-nf] cannot sanctify that (flesh) in (union with) which they were not \"apprehended.\" The grace of God, moreover, sanctifies that which it finds.

Consider also whether this passage is not of the same kind,[fn-7-P712_295882:64-nf] \"Clothe yourselves with the new man, which is created according to God\"; and this,[fn-7-P713_295983:65-nf] \"If, therefore, any one be in Christ, he is a new creature\"; and whatever other expressions of a similar nature any one may find who shall carefully search the divinely inspired Scripture. Wherefore, one should not be surprised if in this passage, \"The Lord created me the beginning of his ways,\" the term \"created\" is used metaphorically, instead of \"appointed\" or constituted.'Such words Eusebius uses in his work against Marcellus; we have quoted them on account of those who have slanderously attempted to traduce and criminate him. Neither can they prove that Eusebius attributes a beginning of subsistence to the Son of God, although they may find him often using the expressions by accommodation; and especially so, because he · was an emulator and admirer of the works of Origen, in which those who are able to comprehend the depth of Origen's writings, will perceive it to be everywhere stated that the Son was begotten of the Father. These remarks have been made in passing, in order to refute those who have misrepresented Eusebius.","title":"Book II.","author":"Socrates Scholasticus"},{"chapter":2,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_07_book_ii_","source_chapter":38,"source_paragraph":"196","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"Of the Synod at Ariminum, and the Creed there published.[fn-8-P865_360544:130-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Socrates Scholasticus"},{"chapter":2,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_07_book_ii_","source_chapter":38,"source_paragraph":"196","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"Of the Synod at Ariminum, and the Creed there published.[fn-8-P865_360544:130-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Socrates Scholasticus"},{"chapter":2,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_07_book_ii_","source_chapter":38,"source_paragraph":"196","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"Of the Synod at Ariminum, and the Creed there published.[fn-8-P865_360544:130-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Socrates Scholasticus"},{"chapter":2,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_07_book_ii_","source_chapter":38,"source_paragraph":"196","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"Of the Synod at Ariminum, and the Creed there published.[fn-8-P865_360544:130-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Socrates Scholasticus"},{"chapter":2,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_07_book_ii_","source_chapter":38,"source_paragraph":"196","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"Of the Synod at Ariminum, and the Creed there published.[fn-8-P865_360544:130-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Socrates Scholasticus"},{"chapter":2,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_07_book_ii_","source_chapter":38,"source_paragraph":"197","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"The emperor on being apprised of what had taken place, sent these three bishops into exile; and determined to convene an ecumenical council, that by drawing all the Eastern bishops into the West, he might if possible bring them all to agree.

Now the emperor had long before intended to disseminate Arian doctrine throughout the churches-; and was anxious to give it the pre-eminence; hence he pretended that their departure was an act of contumely, declaring that they had treated him with contempt by dissolving the council in opposition to his wishes. He therefore gave the partisans of Ursacius unbounded license to act as they pleased in regard to the churches: and directed that the revised form of creed which had been read at Ariminum should be sent to the churches throughout Italy; ordering that whoever would not subscribe it should be ejected from their sees, and that others should be substituted in their place.[fn-9-P903_385464:149-nf] And first Liberius, bishop of Rome, having refused his assent to that creed, was sent into exile; the adherents of Ursacius appointing Felix to succeed him, who had been a deacon in that church, but on embracing the Arian heresy was elevated to the episcopate. Some however assert that he was not favorable to that opinion, but was constrained by force to receive the ordination of bishop. After this all parts of the West were filled with agitation and tumult, some being ejected and banished, and others established in their stead. These things were effected by violence, on the authority of the imperial edicts, which were also sent into the eastern parts. Not long after indeed Liberius was recalled, and reinstated in his see; for the people of Rome having raised a sedition, and expelled Felix from their church, the emperor even though against his wish consented. The partisans of Ursacius, quitting Italy, passed through the eastern parts; and arriving at Nice, a city of Thrace, they dwelt there a short time and held another Synod, and after translating the form of faith which was read at Ariminum into Greek, they confirmed and published it afresh in the form quoted above, giving it the name of the general council, in this way attempting to deceive the more simple by the similarity of names, and to impose upon them as the creed promulgated at Nicaea in Bithynia, that which they had prepared at Nice in Thrace.[fn-9-P904_386927:150-nf] But this artifice was of little advantage to them; for it was soon detected, they became the object of derision. Enough now has been said of the transactions which took place in the West: we must now proceed to the narrative of what was done in the East at the same time.","title":"Book II.","author":"Socrates Scholasticus"},{"chapter":2,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_07_book_ii_","source_chapter":46,"source_paragraph":"244","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"Macedonius on being ejected from Constantinople, bore his condemnation ill and became restless; he therefore associated himself with the other faction that had deposed Acacius and his party at Seleucia, and sent a deputation to Sophronius and Eleusius, to encourage them to adhere to that creed which was first promulgated at Antioch, and afterwards confirmed at Seleucia, proposing to give it the counterfeit[fn-9-P976_431494:185-nf] name of the `homoiousian' creed.[fn-9-P977_431825:186-nf] By this means he drew around him a great number of adherents, who from him are still denominated `Macedonians.' And although such as dissented from the Acacians at the Seleucian Synod had not previously used the term homoiousios, yet from that period they distinctly asserted it. There was, however, a popular report that this term did not originate with Macedonius, but was the invention rather of Marathonius, who a little before had been set over the church at Nicomedia; on which account the maintainers of this doctrine were also called `Marathonians.' To this party Eustathius joined himself, who for the reasons before stated had been ejected from the church at Sebastia. But when Macedonius began to deny the Divinity of the Holy Spirit in the Trinity, Eustathius said: `I can neither admit that the Holy Spirit is God, nor can I dare affirm him to be a creature.' For this reason those who hold the homoousion of the Son call these heretics `Pneumatomachi.'[fn-9-P978_432828:187-nf] By what means these Macedonians became so numerous in the Hellespont, I shall state in its proper place.[fn-9-P979_432994:188-nf] The Acacians meanwhile became extremely anxious that another Synod should be convened at Antioch, in consequence of having changed their mind respecting their former assertion of the likeness `in all things' of the Son to the Father. A small number of them therefore assembled in the following consulate[fn-9-P980_433311:189-nf] which was that of Taurus and Florentius, at Antioch in Syria, where the emperor was at that time residing, Euzoïus being bishop. A discussion was then renewed on some of those points which they had previously determined, in the course of which they declared that the term `homoios' ought to be erased from the form of faith which had been published both at Ariminum and Constantinople; and they no longer concealed but openly declared that the Son was altogether unlike the Father, not merely in relation to his essence, but even as it respected his will i asserting boldly also, as Arius had already done, that he was made of nothing. Those in that city who favored the heresy of Aëtius, gave, their assent to this opinion; from which circumstance in addition to the general appellation of Arians, they were also termed `Anomoeans,'[fn-9-P981_434161:190-nf] and `Exucontians,'[fn-9-P982_434297:191-nf] by those at Antioch who embraced the homoousian, who nevertheless were at that time divided among themselves on account of Meletius, as I have before observed. Being therefore questioned by them, how they dared to affirm that the Son is unlike the Father, and has his existence from nothing, after having acknowledged him `God of God' in their former creed? they endeavored to elude this objection by such fallacious subterfuges as these. `The expression, \"God of God,\"' said they, `is to be understood in the same sense as the words of the apostle,[fn-9-P983_435058:192-nf] \"but all things of God.\" Wherefore the Son is of God, as being one of these all things: and it is for this reason the words \"according to the Scriptures\" are added in the draught of the creed.' The author of this sophism was George bishop of Laodicea, who being unskilled in such phrases, was ignorant of the manner in which Origen had formerly explained these peculiar expressions of the apostle, having thoroughly investigated the matter. But notwithstanding these evasive cavilings, they were unable to bear the reproach and contumely they had drawn upon themselves, and fell back upon the creed which they had before put forth at Constantinople; and so each one retired to his own district. George returning to Alexandria, resumed his authority over the churches there, Athanasius still not having made his appearance. Those in that city who were opposed to his sentiments he persecuted; and conducting himself with great severity and cruelty, he rendered himself extremely odious to the people. At Jerusalem Arrenius[fn-9-P984_436102:193-nf] was placed over the church instead of Cyril: we may also remark that Heraclius was ordained bishop there after him, and after him Hilary. At length, however, Cyril returned to Jerusalem, and was again invested with the presidency over the church there. About the same time another heresy sprang up, which arose from the following circumstance.","title":"Book II.","author":"Socrates Scholasticus"},{"chapter":2,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_11_book_i_","source_chapter":31,"source_paragraph":"130","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Now there is much significance in that He does not say, \"The wrath of God shall come upon him,\" but \"abideth on him.\" For from this wrath (in which we are all involved under sin, and of which the apostle says, \"For we too were once by nature the children of wrath, even as others \"[fn-4-P449_369682:88-nf] ) nothing delivers us but the grace of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

For by saying \"through whom we have received grace and apostleship,\"[fn-13-P1306_310171:125-nf] he declares the supply of the good gifts to proceed from that source; and again in saying \"through whom we have had access,\"[fn-13-P1307_310314:126-nf] he sets forth our acceptance and being made \"of the household of God\"[fn-13-P1308_310402:127-nf] through Christ. Is then the confession of the grace wrought by Him to usward a detraction from His glory? Is it not truer to say that the recital of His benefits is a proper argument for glorifying Him? It is on this account that we have not found Scripture describing the Lord to us by one name, nor even by such terms alone as are indicative of His godhead and majesty.

Them that have fled for refuge to His ruling care, and through patient endurance have mended their wayward ways,[fn-13-P1329_312563:148-nf] He calls \"sheep,\" and confesses Himself to be, to them that hear His voice and refuse to give heed to strange teaching, a \"shepherd.\" For \"my sheep, He says, \"hear my voice.\" To them that have now reached a higher stage and stand in need of righteous royalty,[fn-13-P1330_312849:149-nf] He is a King. And in that, through the straight way of His commandments, He leads men to good actions, and again because He safely shuts in all who through faith in Him betake themselves for shelter to the blessing of the higher wisdom,[fn-13-P1331_314297:150-nf] He is a Door.So He says, \"By me if any man enter in, ... he shall go in and out and shall find pastare.\"[fn-13-P1332_314618:151-nf] Again, because to the faithful He is a defence strong, unshaken, and harder to break than any bulwark, He is a Rock. Among these titles, it is when He is styled Door, or Way, that the phrase \"through Him\" is very appropriate and plain. As, however, God and Son, He is glorified with and together with[fn-13-P1333_314995:152-nf] the Father, in that \"at, the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.\"[fn-13-P1334_315246:153-nf] Wherefore we use both terms, expressing by the one His own proper dignity, and by the other His grace to usward.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":2,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"113","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"31. But even if some are baptized unto the Spirit, it is not, it is urged, on this account right for the Spirit to be ranked with God. Some \"were baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea.\"[fn-14-P1484_362053:265-nf] And it is admitted that faith even before now has been put in men; for \"The people believed God and his servant Moses.\"[fn-14-P1485_362201:266-nf] Why then, it is asked, do we, on account of faith and of baptism, exalt and magnify the Holy Spirit so far above creation, when there is evidence that the same things have before now been said of men? What, then, shall we reply? Our answer is that the faith in the Spirit is the same as the faith in the Father and the Son; and in like manner, too, the baptism. But the faith in Moses and in the cloud is, as it were, in a shadow and type. The nature of the divine is very frequently represented by the rough and shadowy outlines[fn-14-P1486_362751:267-nf] of the types;but because divine things are prefigured by small and human things, it is obvious that we must not therefore conclude the divine nature to be small. The type is an exhibition of things expected, and gives an imitative anticipation of the future. So Adam was a type of\"Him that was to come.\"[fn-14-P1487_363080:268-nf] Typically, \"That rock was Christ;\"[fn-14-P1488_363356:269-nf] and the water a type of the living power of the word; as He says, \"If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.\"[fn-14-P1489_363494:270-nf] The manna is a type of the living bread that came down from heaven;[fn-14-P1490_363583:271-nf] and the serpent on the standard,[fn-14-P1491_363637:272-nf] of the passion of salvation accomplished by means of the cross, wherefore they who even looked thereon were preserved. So in like manner, the history of the exodus of Israel is recorded to shew forth those who are being saved through baptism. For the firstborn of the Israelites were preserved, like the bodies of the baptized, by the giving of grace to them that were marked with blood. For the blood of the sheep is a type of the blood of Christ; and the firstborn, a type of the first-formed. And inasmuch as the first-formed of necessity exists in us, and, in sequence of succession, is transmitted till the end, it follows that \"in Adam\" we \"all die,\"[fn-14-P1492_364318:273-nf] and that \"death reigned\"[fn-14-P1493_364409:274-nf] until the fulfilling of the law and the coming of Christ. And the firstborn were preserved by God from being touched by the destroyer, to show that we who were made alive in Christ no longer die in Adam. The sea and the cloud for the time being led on through amazement to faith, but for the time to come they typically prefigured the grace to be. \"Who is wise and he shall understand these things?\"[fn-14-P1494_364831:275-nf] -how the sea is typically a baptism bringing about the departure of Pharaoh. in like manner as this washing causes the departure of the tyranny of the devil. The sea slew the enemy in itself: and in baptism too dies our enmity towards God. From the sea the people came out unharmed: we too, as it were, alive from the dead, step up from the water \"saved\" by the \"grace\" of Him who called us.[fn-14-P1495_365242:276-nf] And the cloud is a shadow of the gift of the Spirit, who cools the flame of our passions by the \"mortification\" of our\"members.\"[fn-14-P1496_365391:277-nf] ","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":2,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"166","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"59. As we find both expressions in use among the faithful, we use both; in the belief that full glory is equally given to the Spirit by both. The mouths, how, ever, of revilers of the truth may best be stopped by the preposition which, while it has the same meaning as that of the Scriptures, is not so wieldy a weapon for our opponents,(indeed it is now an object of their attack) and is used instead of the conjunction and. For to say \"Paul and Silvanus and Timothy\"[fn-17-P1794_461640:512-nf] is precisely the same thing as to say Paul with Timothy and Silvanus; for the connexion of the names is, preserved by either mode of expression. The Lord says \"The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-17-P1795_461861:513-nf] If I say the Father and the Son with the Holy Ghost shall I make, any difference in the sense? Of the connexion of names by means of the conjunction and the instances are many. We read \"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost,\"[fn-17-P1796_462149:514-nf] and again \"I beseech you for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit.\"[fn-17-P1797_462333:515-nf] Now if we wish to use with instead of and, what difference shall we have made? I do not see; unless any one according to hard and fast grammatical rules might prefer the conjunction as copulative and making the union stronger, and reject the preposition as of inferior force. But if we had to defend ourselves on these points I do not suppose we should require a defence of many words. As it is, their argument is not about syllables nor yet about this or that sound of a word, but about things differing. most widely in power and in truth. It is for this reason that, while the use of the syllables is really a matter of no importance whatever, our opponents are making the endeavour to authorise some syllables, and bunt out others from the Church. For my own part, although the usefulness of the word is obvious as soon as it is heard, I will nevertheless set forth the arguments which led our fathers to adopt the reasonable coarse of employing the preposition \"with.\"[fn-17-P1798_463328:516-nf] It does indeed equally well with the preposition \"and,\" confute the mischief of Sabellius;[fn-17-P1799_463444:517-nf] and it sets forth quite as well as \"and\" the distinction of the hypostases, as in the words \"I and my Father will come,\"[fn-18-P1800_463589:518-nf] and \"I and my Father are one.\"[fn-18-P1801_463640:519-nf] In addition to this the proof it contains of the eternal fellowship and uninterrupted conjunction is excellent. For to say that the Son is with the Father is to exhibit at once the distinction of the hypostases, and the inseparability of the fellowship. The same thing is observable even in mere human matters, for the conjunction \"and\" intimates that there is a common element in an action, while the preposition \"with\" declares in some sense as well the communion in action. As, for instance;-Paul and Timothy sailed to MaCedonia, but both Tychicus and Onesimus were sent to the Colossians. Hence we learn that they did the same thing. But suppose we are told that they sailed with, and were sent with? Then we are informed in addition that they carried out the action in company with one another. Thus while the word \"with\" upsets the error of Sabellius as no other word can, it routs also sinners who err in the very opposite direction; those, I mean, who separate the Son from the Father and the Spirit from the Son, by intervals of time.[fn-18-P1802_464907:520-nf] ","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":2,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"177","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"66.[fn-18-P1856_483019:561-nf] Of the beliefs and practices whether generally accepted or publicly enjoined which are preserved in the Church[fn-18-P1857_483150:562-nf] some we possess derived from written teaching; others we have received delivered to us \"in a mystery\"[fn-18-P1858_483474:563-nf] by the tradition of the apostles; and both of these in relation to true religion have the same force. And these no one will gainsay;-no one, at all events, who is even moderately versed in the institutions of the Church. For were we to attempt to reject such customs as have no written authority, on the ground that the importance they possess is small, we should unintentionally injure the Gospel in its very vitals; or, rather, should make our public definition a mere phrase and nothing more.[fn-18-P1859_486470:564-nf] For instance, to take the first and most general example, who is thence who has taught us in writing to sign with the sign of the cross those who have trusted in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ? What writing has taught us to turn to the East at the prayer? Which of the saints has left us in writing the words of tim invocation at the displaying[fn-18-P1860_491290:565-nf] of the bread of the Eucharist and the cup of blessing? For we are not, as is well known, content with what the apostle or the Gospel has recorded, but both in preface and conclusion we add other words as being of great importance to the validity of the ministry, and these we derive from unwritten teaching. Moreover we bless the water of baptism andthe oil of the chrism, and besides this the catechumen who is being baptized. On what written authority do we do this? Is not our authority silent and mystical tradition? Nay, by what written word is the anointing of oil[fn-18-P1861_492104:566-nf] itself taught? And whence comes the custom of baptizing thrice?[fn-18-P1862_492340:567-nf] And as to the other customs of baptism from what Scripture do we derive the renunciation of Satan and his angels? Does not this come from that unpublished and secret teaching which oar fathers guarded in a silence out of the reach of curious meddling and inquisitive investigation? Well had they learnt the lesson that the awful dignity of the mysteries is best preserved by silence. What the uninitiated are not even allowed: to look at was hardly likely to be publiclyparaded about in written documents. What was the meaning of the mighty Moses in not making all the parts of the tabernacle open to every one? The profane he stationed without the sacred barriers; the first courts he conceded to the purer; the Levites alone he judged worthy of being servants of the Deity; sacrifices and burnt offerings and the rest of the priestly functions he allotted to the priests; one chosen out of all he admitted to the shrine, and even this one not always but on only one day in the year, and of this one day a time was fixed for his entry so that he might gaze on the Holy of Holies amazed at the strangeness and novelty of the sight. Moses was wise enough to know that contempt stretches to the trite and to the obvious, while a keen interest is naturally associated with the unusual and the unfamiliar. In the same manner the Apostles and Fathers who laid down laws for the Church from the beginning thus guarded the awful dignity of the mysteries in secrecy and silence, for what is bruited abroad random among the common folk is no mystery at all. This is the reason for our tradition of unwritten precepts and practices, that the knowledge of our dogmas may not become neglected and contemned by the multitude through familiarity. \"Dogma\" and \"Kerugma\" are two distinct things; the former is observed in silence; the latter is proclaimed to all the world. One form of this silence is the obscurity employed in Scripture, which makes the meaning of \"dogmas\" difficult to be understood for the very advantage of the reader: Thus we all look to the East[fn-18-P1863_496971:568-nf] at our prayers, but few of us know that we are seeking our own old country,[fn-18-P1864_497282:569-nf] Paradise, which God planted in Eden in the East.[fn-18-P1865_497529:570-nf] We pray standing,[fn-18-P1866_497603:571-nf] on the first day of the week, but we do not all know the reason. On the day of the resurrection (or \"standing again\" Grk. a0na/stasij we remind ourselves of the grace given to us by standing at prayer, not only because we rose with Christ,[fn-18-P1867_497868:572-nf] and are bound to \"seek those things which are above,\"[fn-18-P1868_497941:573-nf] but because the day seems to us to be in some sense an image of the age which we expect, wherefore, though it is the beginning of days, it is not called by Moses first, but one.[fn-18-P1869_498455:574-nf] For he says \"There was evening, and therewas morning, one day,\" as though the same day often recurred. Now \"one and \"eighth\" are the same, in itself distinctly indicating that really \"one\" and \"eighth\" of which the Psalmist makes mention in certain titles of the Psalms, the state which follows after this present time, the day which knows no waning or eventide, and no successor, that age which endeth not or groweth old.[fn-18-P1870_498922:575-nf] Of necessity, then, the church teaches her own foster children to offer their prayers on that day standing, to the end that through continual reminder of the endless life we may not neglect to make provision for our removal thither. Moreover all Pentecost is a reminder of the resurrection expected in the age to come. For that one and first day, if seven times multiplied by seven, completes the seven weeks of the holy Pentecost; for, beginning at the first, Pentecost ends with the same, making fifty revolutions through the like intervening days. And so it is a likeness of eternity, beginning as it does and ending, as in a circling course, at the same point. On this day the rules of the church have educated us to prefer the upright attitude of prayer, for by their plain reminder they, as It were, make our mind to dwell no longer in the present but in the future. Moreover every time we fall upon our knees and rise from off them we shew by the very deed that by our sin we fell down to earth, and by the loving kindness of our Creator were called hack to heaven.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":2,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":29,"source_paragraph":"182","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"69. But let us see if we can bethink us of any defence of this usage of our fathers; for they who first originated the expression are more open to blame than we ourselves. Paul in his Letter to the Colossians says, \"And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision ... hath He quickened together with\"[fn-18-P1880_504463:579-nf] Christ. Did then God give to a whole people and to the Church the boon of the life with Christ, and yet the life with Christ does not belong to the Holy Spirit? But if this is impious even to think of, is it not rightly reverent so to make our confession, as They are by nature in close conjunction? Furthermore what boundless lack of sensibility does it not shew in these men to confess that the Saints are with Christ,(if, as we know is the case, Paul, on becoming absent from the body, is present with the Lord,[fn-18-P1881_505000:580-nf] and, after departing, is with Christ[fn-18-P1882_505057:581-nf] ) and, so far as lies in their power, to refuse to allow to the Spirit to be with Christ even to the same extent as men? And Paul calls himself a \"labourer together with God\"[fn-18-P1883_505252:582-nf] in the dispensation of the Gospel; will they bring an indictment for impiety against us, if we apply the term \"fellow-labourer\" to the Holy Spirit, through whom in every creature under heaven the Gospel bringeth forth fruit?[fn-18-P1884_505501:583-nf] The life of them that have trusted in the Lord \"is hidden,\" it would seem, \"with Christ in God, and when Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall\" they themselves also \"appear with Him in glory;\"[fn-18-P1885_505730:584-nf] and is the Spirit of life Himself, \"Who made us free from the law of sin,\"[fn-18-P1886_505827:585-nf] not with Christ, both in the secret and hidden life with Him, and in the manifestation of the glory which we expect to be manifested in the saints?

For the height of folly is reached if we through the faith in Christ which is in the Spirit[fn-18-P1889_506472:588-nf] hope that we shall be raised together with Him and sit together in heavenly places,[fn-18-P1890_506578:589-nf] whenever He shall change our vile body from the natural to the spiritual,[fn-18-P1891_506792:590-nf] and yet refuse to assign to the Spirit any share in the sitting together, or in the glory, or anything else which we have received from Him.

He further shows that to this same wrath also pertains the death of man. For after saying, \"He hath but a short time to live, and is full of wrath,\" he added, \"Like a flower that hath bloomed, so doth he fall; he is gone like a shadow, and continueth not.\" He then subjoins: \"Hast Thou not caused him to enter into judgment with Thee? For who is pure from uncleanness? Not even one; even should his life last but a day.\" In these words he in fact says, Thou hast thrown upon man, short-lived though he be, the care of entering into judgment with Thee. For how brief soever be his life, - even if it last but a single day,-he could not possibly be clean of filth; and therefore with perfect justice must he come under Thy judgment. Then, when he says again, \"Thou hast numbered all my necessities, and not one of my sins hath escaped Thee: Thou hast sealed up my transgressions in a bag, and hast marked whatever I have done unwillingly;\" is it not clear enough that even thosesins are justly imputed which are not committed through allurement of pleasure, but for the sake of avoiding some trouble, or pain, or death? Now these sins, too, are said to be committed under some necessity, whereas they ought all to be overcome by the love and pleasure of righteousness.

Having had some slight taste of philosophical science from him who then taught it at Antioch, they procured Origen's works, and drew from them the right interpretation of the sacred Scriptures; for the fame of Origen was very great and widespread throughout the whole world at that time; after a careful perusal of the writings of that great man, they contended against the Arians with manifest advantage.

Basil being ordained to the office of deacon, was by Meletius, bishop of Antioch, from that rank elevated to the bishopric of Caesarea in Cappadocia, which was his native country. Thither he therefore hastened, fearing lest these Arian dogmas should have infected the provinces of Pontus; and in order to counteract them, he founded several monasteries, diligently instructed the people in his own doctrines, and confirmed the faith of those whose minds were wavering. Gregory being constituted bishop of Nazianzus,[fn-14-P1431_626658:77-nf] a small city of Cappadocia over which his own father had before presided, pursued a course similar to that which Basil took; for he went through the various cities, and strengthened the weak in faith To Constantinople in particular he made frequent visits, and by his ministrations there, comforted and assured the orthodox believers, wherefore a short time after, by the suffrage of many bishops, he was made bishop of the church at Constantinople. When intelligence of the proceedings of these two zealous and devoted men reached the ears of the emperor Valens, he immediately ordered Basil to be brought from Caesarea to Antioch;[fn-14-P1432_627748:78-nf] where being arraigned before the tribunal of the prefect, that functionary asked him `why he would not embrace the emperor's faith?' Basil with much boldness condemned the errors of that creed which his sovereign countenanced, and vindicated the doctrine of the homoousion: and when the prefect threatened him with death, `Would,' said Basil, `that I might be released from the bonds of the body for the truth's sake.' The prefect having exhorted him to reconsider the matter more seriously, Basil is reported to have said, `I am the same to-day that I shall be to-morrow: but I wish that you had not changed yourself.' At that time, therefore, Basil remained in custody throughout the day. It happened, however, not long afterwards that Galates, the emperor's infant son, was attacked with a dangerous malady, so that the physicians despaired of his recovery; when the empress Dominica, his mother, assured the emperor that she had been greatly disquieted in her dreams by fearful visions, which led her to believe that the child's illness was a chastisement on account of the ill treatment of the bishop. The emperor after a little reflection sent for Basil, and in order to prove his faith said to him, `If the doctrine you maintain is the truth, pray that my son may not die.' `If your majesty should believe as I do,' replied Basil, `and the church should be unified, the child shall live.' To these conditions the emperor would not agree: `God's will concerning the child will be done then,' said Basil; as Basil said this the emperor ordered him to be dismissed; the child, however, died shortly after. Such is an epitome of the history of these distinguished ecclesiastics, both of whom have left us many admirable works, some of which Rufinus says he has translated into Latin. Basil had two brothers, Peter and Gregory; the former of whom adopted Basil's monastic mode of life; while the latter emulated his eloquence in teaching, and completed after his death Basil's treatise on the Six Days' Work, which had been left unfinished. He also pronounced at Constantinople the funeral oration of Meletius, bishop of Antioch; and many other orations of his are still extant.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Socrates Scholasticus"},{"chapter":2,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_09_book_iv_","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"130","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"Now Providence opposed Didymus to the Arians at Alexandria.

Basil being ordained to the office of deacon, was by Meletius, bishop of Antioch, from that rank elevated to the bishopric of Caesarea in Cappadocia, which was his native country. Thither he therefore hastened, fearing lest these Arian dogmas should have infected the provinces of Pontus; and in order to counteract them, he founded several monasteries, diligently instructed the people in his own doctrines, and confirmed the faith of those whose minds were wavering. Gregory being constituted bishop of Nazianzus,[fn-14-P1431_626658:77-nf] a small city of Cappadocia over which his own father had before presided, pursued a course similar to that which Basil took; for he went through the various cities, and strengthened the weak in faith To Constantinople in particular he made frequent visits, and by his ministrations there, comforted and assured the orthodox believers, wherefore a short time after, by the suffrage of many bishops, he was made bishop of the church at Constantinople. When intelligence of the proceedings of these two zealous and devoted men reached the ears of the emperor Valens, he immediately ordered Basil to be brought from Caesarea to Antioch;[fn-14-P1432_627748:78-nf] where being arraigned before the tribunal of the prefect, that functionary asked him `why he would not embrace the emperor's faith?' Basil with much boldness condemned the errors of that creed which his sovereign countenanced, and vindicated the doctrine of the homoousion: and when the prefect threatened him with death, `Would,' said Basil, `that I might be released from the bonds of the body for the truth's sake.' The prefect having exhorted him to reconsider the matter more seriously, Basil is reported to have said, `I am the same to-day that I shall be to-morrow: but I wish that you had not changed yourself.' At that time, therefore, Basil remained in custody throughout the day. It happened, however, not long afterwards that Galates, the emperor's infant son, was attacked with a dangerous malady, so that the physicians despaired of his recovery; when the empress Dominica, his mother, assured the emperor that she had been greatly disquieted in her dreams by fearful visions, which led her to believe that the child's illness was a chastisement on account of the ill treatment of the bishop. The emperor after a little reflection sent for Basil, and in order to prove his faith said to him, `If the doctrine you maintain is the truth, pray that my son may not die.' `If your majesty should believe as I do,' replied Basil, `and the church should be unified, the child shall live.' To these conditions the emperor would not agree: `God's will concerning the child will be done then,' said Basil; as Basil said this the emperor ordered him to be dismissed; the child, however, died shortly after. Such is an epitome of the history of these distinguished ecclesiastics, both of whom have left us many admirable works, some of which Rufinus says he has translated into Latin. Basil had two brothers, Peter and Gregory; the former of whom adopted Basil's monastic mode of life; while the latter emulated his eloquence in teaching, and completed after his death Basil's treatise on the Six Days' Work, which had been left unfinished.

But for the purpose of confuting them in other cities, it raised up Basil of Caesarea and Gregory of Nazianzus; concerning these it will be reasonable to give a brief account in this place. Indeed the universally prevalent memory of the men would be enough as a token of their fame; and the extent of their knowledge is sufficiently perceptible in their writings. Since, however, the exercise of their talents was of great service to the Church, tending in a high degree to the maintenance of the catholic faith, the nature of my history obliges me to take particular notice of these two persons. If any one should compare Basil and Gregory with one another, and consider the life, morals, and virtues of each, he would find it difficult to decide to which of them he ought to assign the pre-eminence: so equally did they both appear to excel, whether you regard the rectitude of their conduct, or their deep acquaintance with Greek literature and the sacred Scriptures. In their youth they were pupils at Athens of Himerius[fn-14-P1427_623875:73-nf] and Prohaeresius,[fn-14-P1428_624202:74-nf] the most celebrated sophists of that age: subsequently they frequented the school of Libanius[fn-14-P1429_624448:75-nf] at Antioch in Syria, where they cultivated rhetoric to the utmost. Having been deemed worthy of the profession of sophistry, they were urged by many of their friends to enter the profession of teaching eloquence; others would have persuaded them to practice law: but despising both these pursuits, they abandoned their former studies, and embraced the monastic life. Having had some slight taste of philosophical science from him who then taught it at Antioch, they procured Origen's works, and drew from them the right interpretation of the sacred Scriptures; for the fame of Origen was very great and widespread throughout the whole world at that time; after a careful perusal of the writings of that great man, they contended against the Arians with manifest advantage. And when the defenders of Arianism quoted the same author in confirmation, as they imagined, of their own views these two confuted them, and clearly proved that their opponents did not at all understand the reasoning of Origen.

Most members of the synod, won over by his arguments, established concord among themselves, and embraced sound doctrine.

These persons also believe in God; for if they had no faith in Him at all, neither would they of course have any dread of the penalty of His law.

He says: \"Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.\"[fn-17-P1735_774857:308-nf] The fear, then, of which we speak is slavish; and therefore, even though there be in it a belief in the Lord, yet righteousness is not loved by it, but condemnation is feared.

This, again, is the faith by which we procure that largess of the Spirit, of which it is said: \"We indeed through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.\"[fn-17-P1750_777877:323-nf] But this admits of the further question, Whether he meant by \"the hope of righteousness\" that by which righteousness hopes, or that whereby righteousness is itself hoped for? For the just man, who lives by faith, hopes undoubtedly for eternal life; and the faith likewise, which hungers and thirsts for righteousness, makes progress therein by the renewal of the inward man day by day,[fn-17-P1751_778281:324-nf] and hopes to be satiated therewith in that eternal life, where shall be realized that which is said of God by the psalm: \"Who satisfieth thy desire with good things.\"[fn-17-P1752_778470:325-nf] This, moreover, is the faith whereby they are saved to whom it is said: \"By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.\"[fn-17-P1753_778822:326-nf] This, in short, is the faith which works not by fear, but by love;[fn-17-P1754_778910:327-nf] not by dreading punishment, but by loving righteousness. Whence, therefore, arises this love,-that is to say, this charity,-by which faith works, if not from the source whence faith itself obtained it? For it would not be within us, to what extent soever it is in us, if it were not diffused in our hearts by the Holy Ghost who is given to us.[fn-17-P1755_779272:328-nf] Now \"the love of God\" is said to be shed abroad in our hearts, not because He loves us, but because He makes us lovers of Himself; just as \"the righteousness of God\"[fn-17-P1756_779456:329-nf] is used in the sense of our being made righteous by His gift; and \"the salvation of the Lord,\"[fn-17-P1757_779572:330-nf] in that we are saved by Him; and \"the faith of Jesus Christ,\"[fn-17-P1758_779653:331-nf] because He makes us believers in Him. This is that righteousness of God, which He not only teaches us by the precept of His law, but also bestows upon us by the gift of His Spirit.","title":"On the Spirit and the

For immediately after those words of mine which he has quoted, I expressly added, and (as fully as I could) worked out, the train of thought which might occur to any one's mind, to the following effect: \"And yet some actions are disapproved of, even when they are done in ignorance, and are judged deserving of chastisement, as we read in the inspired authorities.\" After taking some examples out of these, I went on to speak also of infirmity as follows: \"Some actions also deserve disapprobation, that are done from necessity; as when a man wishes to act rightly and cannot. For whence arise those utterances: `For the good that I would, I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do'?\"[fn-23-P2351_964478:216-nf] Then, after quoting some other passages of the Holy Scriptures to the same effect, I say: \"But all these are the sayings of persons who are coming out of that condemnation of death; for if this is not man's punishment, but his nature, then those are no sins.\" Then, again, a little afterwards I add: \"It remains, therefore, that this just punishment come of man's condemnation. Nor ought it to be wondered at, that either by ignorance man has not free determination of will to choose what he will rightly do, or that by the resistance of carnal habit (which by force of mortal transmission has, in a certain sense, become engrafted into his nature), though seeing what ought rightly to be done and wishing to do it, he yet is unable to accomplish it. For this is the most just penalty of sin, that a man should lose what he has been unwilling to make good use of, when he might with ease have done so if he would; which, however, amounts to this, that the man who knowingly does not do what is right loses the ability to do it when he wishes. For, in truth, to every soul that sins there accrue these two penal consequences-ignorance and difficulty. Out of the ignorance springs the error which disgraces; out of the difficulty arises the pain which afflicts. But to approve of falsehoods as if they were true, so as to err involuntarily, and to be unable, owing to the resistance and pain of carnal bondage, to refrain from deeds of lust, is not the nature of man as he was created, but the punishment of man as under condemnation. When, however, we speak of a free will to do what is right, we of course mean that liberty in which man was created.\" Some men at once deduce from this what seems to them a just objection from the transfer and transmission of sins of ignorance and difficulty from the first man to his posterity. My answer to such objectors is this: \"I tell them, by way of a brief reply, to be silent and to cease from murmuring against God. Perhaps their complaint might have been a proper one, if no one from among men had stood forth a vanquisher of error and of lust; but when there is everywhere present One who calls off from himself, through the creature by so many means, the man who serves the Lord, teaches him when believing, consoles him when hoping, encourages him when loving, helps him when endeavouring, hears him when praying,-it is not reckoned to you as a fault that you are involuntarily ignorant, but that you neglect to search out what you are ignorant of; nor is it imputed to you in censure that you do not bind up the limbs that are wounded, but that you despise him who wishes to heal them.\"[fn-23-P2352_967134:217-nf] In such terms did I exhort them, as web as I could, to live righteously; nor did I make the grace of God of none effect, without which the now obscured and tarnished nature of man can neither be enlightened nor puttied. Our whole discussion with them on this subject turns upon this, that we frustrate not the grace of God which is in Jesus Christ our Lord by a perverted assertion of nature. In a passage occurring shortly after the last quoted one, I said in reference to nature: \"Of nature itself we speak in one sense, when we properly describe it as that human nature in which man was created faultless after his kind; and in another sense as that nature in which we are born ignorant and carnally minded, owing to the penalty of condemnation, after the manner of the apostle, `We ourselves likewise were by nature children of wrath, even as others.'\"[fn-23-P2353_968027:218-nf] ","title":"On Nature and Grace, Against Pelagius","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_21_the_epistle_of_ignatius_to_the_smyrnaeans","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"40","folder":"ANF-01","text":"They are ashamed of the cross; they mock at the passion; they make a jest of the resurrection.

Their object in such a malignant perversion of the true doctrine, is to show that the less exalted statements, which our Lord utters in tits humanity, are to be thought to have issued from the Godhead Itself, that so they may show their blasphemy to have a stronger case, if it is upheld by the actual acknowledgment of the Lord. For this reason it is that Eunomius says, \"He who in the last days became man did not take upon Himself the man made up of soul and body.\" But, after searching through all the inspired and sacred Scripture, I do not find any such statement as this, that the Creator of all things, at the time of His ministration here on earth for man, took upon Himself flesh only without a soul. Under stress of necessity, then, looking to the object contemplated by the plan of salvation, to the doctrines of the Fathers, and to the inspired Scriptures, I will endeavour to confute the impious falsehood which is being fabricated with regard to this matter. The Lord came \"to seek and to save that which was lost[fn-12-P1204_656584:193-nf] .\" Now it was not the body merely, but the whole man, compacted of soul and body, that was lost: indeed, if we are to speak more exactly, the soul was lost sooner than the body. For disobedience is a sin, not of the body, but of the will: and the will properly belongs to the soul, from which the whole disaster of our nature bad its beginning, as the threat of God, that admits of no falsehood, testifies in the declaration that, in the day that they should eat of the forbidden fruit, death without respite would attach to the act. Now since the condemnation of man was twofold, death correspondingly effects in each part of our nature the deprivation of the twofold life that operates in him who is thus mortally stricken. For the death of the body consists in the extinction of the means of sensible perception, and in the dissolution of the body into its kindred elements: but \"the soul that sinneth,\" he saith, \"it shall die[fn-12-P1205_657543:194-nf] .\" Now sin is nothing else than alienation from God, Who is the true and only life. Accordingly the first man lived many hundred years after his disobedience, and yet God lied not when He said, \"In the day that ye eat thereof ye shall surely die[fn-12-P1206_657814:195-nf] .\" For by the fact of his alienation from the true life, the sentence of death was ratified against him that self-same day: and after this, at a much later time, there followed also the bodily death of Adam. He therefore Who came for this cause that He might seek and save that which was lost, (that which the shepherd in the parable calls the sheep,) both finds that which is lost, and carries home on His shoulders the whole sheep, not its skin only, that He may make the man of God complete, united to the deity in body and in soul. And thus He Who was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin, left no part of our nature which He did not take upon Himself. Now the soul is not sin though it is capable of admitting sin into it as the result of being ill-advised: and this He sanctifies by union with Himself for this end, that so the lump may be holy along with the first-fruits. Wherefore also the Angel, when informing Joseph of the destruction of the enemies of the Lord, said, \"They are dead which sought the young Child's life[fn-12-P1207_658887:196-nf] ,\" (or \"soul\"): and the Lord says to the Jews, \"Ye seek to kill Me, a man that hath told you the truth[fn-12-P1208_659073:197-nf] .\" Now by \"Man\" is not meant the body of a man only, but that which is composed of both, soul and body. And again, He says to them, \"Are ye angry at Me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the Sabbath day[fn-12-P1209_659388:198-nf] ?\" And what He meant by \"every whit whole,\" He showed in the other Gospels, when He said to the man who was let down on a couch in the midst, \"Thy sins be forgiven thee,\" which is a healing of the soul, and, \"Arise and walk[fn-12-P1210_659636:199-nf] ,\" which has regard to the body: and in the Gospel of S. John, by liberating the soul also from its own malady after He had given health to the body, where He saith, \"Thou art made whole, sin no more[fn-12-P1211_659932:200-nf] ,\" thou, that is, who hast been cured in both, I mean in soul and in body. For so too does S. Paul speak, \"for to make in Himself of twain one new man[fn-12-P1212_660105:201-nf] .\" And so too He foretells that at the time of His Passion He would voluntarily detach His soul from His body, saying, \"No man taketh\" my soul \"from Me, but I lay it down of Myself: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again[fn-12-P1213_660370:202-nf] .\" Yea, the prophet David also, according to the interpretation of the great Peter, said with foresight of Him, \"Thou wilt not leave My soul in hell, neither wilt Thou suffer Thine Holy One to see corruption[fn-12-P1214_660678:203-nf] ,\" while the Apostle Peter thus expounds the saying, that \"His soul was not left in hell, neither His flesh did see corruption.\" For His Godhead, alike before taking flesh and in the flesh and after His Passion, is immutably the same, being at all times what It was by nature, and so continuing for ever. But in the suffering of His human nature the Godhead fulfilled the dispensation for our benefit by severing the soul for a season from the body, yet without being Itself separated from either of those elements to which it was once for all united, and by joining again the elements which had been thus parted, so as to give to all human nature a beginning and an example which it should follow of the resurrection from the dead, that all the corruptible may put on incorruption, and all the mortal may put on immortality, our first-fruits having been transformed to the Divine nature by its union with God, as Peter said, \"This same Jesus Whom ye crucified, hath God made both Lord and Christ[fn-12-P1215_661720:204-nf] ;\" and we might cite many passages of Scripture to support such a position, showing how the Lord, reconciling the world to Himself by the Humanity of Christ, apportioned His work of benevolence to men between His soul and His body, willing through His soul and touching them through His body.

By the justice of God in some sense, the human race was delivered into the power of the devil; the sin of the first man passing over originally into all of both sexes in their birth through conjugal union, and the debt of our first parents binding their whole posterity. This delivering up is first signified in Genesis, where, when it had been said to the serpent, \"Dust shalt thou eat,\" it was said to the man, \"Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shall return.\"[fn-16-P1672_833140:23-nf] In the words, \"Unto dust shalt thou return,\" the death of the body is fore-announced, because he would not have experienced that either, if he had continued to the end upright as he was made; but in that it is said to him whilst still living, \"Dust thou art,\" it is shown that the whole man was changed for the worse. For \"Dust thou art\" is much the same as, \"My spirit shall not always remain in these men, for that they also are flesh.\"[fn-16-P1673_833601:24-nf] Therefore it was at that time shown, that he was delivered to him, in that it had been said to him, \"Dust shall thou eat.\" But the apostle declares this more clearly, where he says: \"And you who were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of unfaithfulness; among whom we also had. our conversation in times past, in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.\"[fn-16-P1674_834249:25-nf] The \"children of unfaithfulness\" are the unbelievers; and who is not this before he becomes a believer? And therefore all men are originally under the prince of the power of the air, \"who worketh in the children of unfaithfulness.\" And that which I have expressed by \"originally\" is the same that the apostle expresses when he speaks of themselves who \"by nature\" were as others; viz. by nature as it has been depraved by sin, not as it was created upright from the beginning. But the way in which man was thus delivered into the power of the devil, ought not to be so understood as if God did this, or commanded it to be done; but that He only permitted it, yet that justly. For when He abandoned the sinner, the author of the sin immediately entered. Yet God did not certainly so abandon His own creature as not to show Himself to him as God creating and quickening, and among penal evils bestowing also many good things upon the evil. For He hath not in anger shut up His tender mercies.[fn-16-P1675_835260:26-nf] Nor did He dismiss man from the law of His own power, when He permitted him to be in the power of the devil; since even the devil himself is not separated from the power of the Omnipotent, as neither from His goodness. For whence do even the evil angels subsist in whatever manner of life they have, except through Him who quickens all things? If, therefore, the commission of sins through the just anger of God subjected man to the devil, doubtless the remission of sins through the merciful reconciliation of God rescues man from the devil.","title":"Book XIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_22_a_treatise_on_the_soul_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"99","folder":"ANF-03","text":"That position of Plato's is also quite in keeping with the faith, in which he divides the soul into two parts-the rational and the irrational. To this definition we take no exception, except that we would not ascribe this twofold distinction to the nature (of the soul). It is the rational element which we must believe to be its natural condition, impressed upon it from its very first creation by its Author, who is Himself essentially rational. For how should that be other than rational, which God produced on His own prompting; nay more, which He expressly sent forth by His own afflatus or breath? The irrational element, however, we must understand to have accrued later, as having proceeded from the instigation of the serpent-the very achievement of (the first) transgression-which thenceforward became inherent in the soul, and grew with its growth, assuming the manner by this time of a natural development, happening as it did immediately at the beginning of nature. But, inasmuch as the same Plato speaks of the rational element only as existing in the soul of God Himself, if we were to ascribe the irrational element likewise to the nature which our soul has received from God, then the irrational element will be equally derived from God, as being a natural production, because God is the author of nature. Now from the devil proceeds the incentive to sin. All sin, however, is irrational: therefore the irrational proceeds from the devil, from whom sin proceeds; and it is extraneous to God, to whom also the irrationalis an alien principle. The diversity, then, between these two elements arises from the difference of their authors. When, therefore, Plato reserves the rational element (of the soul) to God alone, and subdivides it into two departments the irascible, which they call qumiko/n, and the concupiscible, which they designate by the term e0piqumhtiko/n (in such a way as to make the first common to us and lions, and the second shared between ourselves and flies, whilst the rational element is confined to us and God)-I see that this point will have to be treated by us, owing to the facts which we find operating also in Christ. For you may behold this triad of qualities in the Lord. There was the rational element, by which He taught, by which He discoursed, by which He prepared the way of salvation; there was moreover indignation in Him, by which He inveighed against the scribes and the Pharisees; and there was the principle of desire, by which He so earnestly desired to eat the pass over with His disciples.[fn-27-P2727_912997:111-nf] In our own cases, accordingly, the irascible and the concupiscible elements of our soul must not invariably be put to the account of the irrational (nature), since we are sure that in our Lord these elements operated in entire accordance with reason. God will be angry, with perfect reason, with all who deserve His wrath; and with reason, too, will God desire whatever objects and claims are worthy of Himself. For He will show indignation against the evil man, and for the good man will He desire salvation. To ourselves even does the apostle allow the concupiscible quality. \"If any man,\" says he, \"desireth the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.\"[fn-27-P2728_913680:112-nf] Now, by saying \"a good work,\" he shows us that the desire is a reasonable one. He permits us likewise to feel indignation. How should he not, when he himself experiences the same? \"I would,\" says he, \"that they were even cut off which trouble you.\"[fn-27-P2729_913951:113-nf] In perfect agreement with reason was that indignation which resulted from his desire to maintain discipline and order. When, however, he says, \"We were formerly the children of wrath,\"[fn-27-P2730_914155:114-nf] he censures an irrational irascibility, such as proceeds not from that nature which is the production of God, but from that which the devil brought in, who is himself styled the lord or \"master\" of his own class, \"Ye cannot serve two masters,\"[fn-27-P2731_914418:115-nf] and has the actual designation of \"father: \"\"Ye are of your father the devil.\"[fn-27-P2732_914518:116-nf] So that you need not be afraid to ascribe to him the mastery and dominion over that second, later, and deteriorated nature (of which we have been speaking), when you read of him as \"the sewer of tares, and the nocturnal spoiler of the crop of corn.[fn-27-P2733_914787:117-nf] ","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_22_a_treatise_on_the_soul_","source_chapter":23,"source_paragraph":"109","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Now, if the soul possessed this uniform and simple nature from the beginning in Adam, previous to so many mental dispositions (being developed out of it), it is not rendered multiform by suck various development, nor by the triple[fn-27-P2795_947098:164-nf] form predicated of it in \"the Valentinian trinity\" (that we may still keep the condemnation of that heresy in view), for not even this nature is discoverable in Adam. What had he that was spiritual? Is it because he prophetically declared \"the great mystery of Christ and the church? \"[fn-27-P2796_947493:165-nf] \"This is bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman. Therefore shall a man leave his father and mother, and he shall cleave unto his wife; and they two shall be one flesh.\"[fn-27-P2797_947708:166-nf] But this (gift of prophecy) only came on him afterwards, when God infused into him the ecstasy, or spiritual quality, in which prophecy consists. If, again, the evil of sin was developed in him, this must not be accounted as a natural disposition: it was rather produced by the instigation of the (old) serpent as far from being incidental to his nature as it was from being material in him, for we have already excluded belief in \"Matter.\"[fn-27-P2798_948173:167-nf] Now, if neither the spiritual element, nor what the heretics call the material element, was properly inherent in him (since, if he had been created out of matter, the germ of evil must have been an integral part of his constitution), it remains that the one only original element of his nature was what is called the animal (the principle of vitality, the soul), which we maintain to be simple and uniform in its condition. Concerning this, it remains for us to inquire whether, as being called natural, it ought to be deemed subject to change. (The heretics whom we have referred to) deny that nature is susceptible of any change,[fn-27-P2799_948836:168-nf] in order that they may be able to establish and settle their threefold theory, or \"trinity,\" in all its characteristics as to the several natures, because \"a good tree cannot produce evil fruit, nor a corrupt tree good fruit; and nobody gathers figs of thorns, nor grapes of brambles.\"[fn-28-P2800_949154:169-nf] If so, then \"God will not be able any longer to raise up from the stones children unto Abraham; nor to make a generation of vipers bring forth fruits of repentance.\"[fn-28-P2801_949344:170-nf] And if so, the apostle too was in error when he said in his epistle, \"Ye were at one time darkness, (but now are ye light in the Lord: )\"[fn-28-P2802_949505:171-nf] and, \"We also were by nature children of wrath; \"[fn-28-P2803_949573:172-nf] and, \"Such were some of you, but ye are washed.\"[fn-28-P2804_949641:173-nf] The statements, however, of holy Scripture will never be discordant with truth. A corrupt tree will never yield good fruit, unless the better nature be grafted into it; nor will a good tree produce evil fruit, except by the same process of cultivation. Stones also will become children of Abraham, if educated in Abraham's faith; and a generation of vipers will bring forth the fruits of penitence, if they reject the poison of their malignant nature. This will be the power of the grace of God, more potent indeed than nature, exercising its sway over the faculty that underlies itself within us-even the freedom of our will, which is described as au0tecou/sioj (of independent authority); and inasmuch as this faculty is itself also natural and mutable, in whatsoever direction it turns, it inclines of its own nature. Now, that there does exist within us naturally this independent authority (to\\ au0tecou/sion), we have already shown in opposition both to Marcion[fn-28-P2805_950631:174-nf] and to Hermogenes.[fn-28-P2806_950688:175-nf] if, then, the natural condition has to be submitted to a definition, it must be determined to be twofold-there being the category of the born and the unborn, the made and not-made. Now that which has received its constitution by being made or by being born, is by nature capable of being changed, for it can be both born again and re-made; whereas that which is not-made and unborn will remain for ever immoveable. Since, however, this state is suited to God alone, as the only Being who is unborn and not-made (and therefore immortal and unchangeable), it is absolutely certain that the nature of all other existences which are born and created is subject to modification and change; so that if the threefold state is to be ascribed to the soul, it must be supposed to arise from the mutability of its accidental circumstances, and not from the appointment of nature.","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_14_book_iii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"31","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But our discourse has diverged too far from the subject before us, in following one the questions which arise from time to time by way of inference.

For if, according to their view, the natural relation to the Father is established by the appellation of \"the Son,\" and so with that of the \"product of generation\" to Him Who has begotten Him (as these men's wisdom falsely models the terms significant of the Divine nature into a verbal arrangement, according to some grammatical frivolity), no one could longer doubt that the mutual relation of the names which is established by nature is a proof of their kindred, or rather of their identity of essence. But let not our discourse merely turn about our adversaries' words, that the orthodox doctrine may not seem to gain the victory only by the weakness of those who fight against it, but appear to have an abundant supply of strength in itself. Let the adverse argument, therefore, be strengthened as much as may be by us ourselves with more energetic advocacy, that the superiority of our force may be recognized with full confidence, as we bring to the unerring test of truth those arguments also which our adversaries have omitted. He who contends on behalf of our adversaries will perhaps say that the name of \"Son,\" or \"product of generation,\" does not by any means establish the fact of kindred in nature.

Lest, then, he make such a rejoinder, consider, some other words of his on this subject: \"The man,\" says he, \"who hastens to the Lord, and desires to be directed by Him, that is, who makes his own will depend upon God's, who moreover cleaves so closely to the Lord as to become (as the apostle says) 'one spirit' with Him,[fn-33-P3329_1288612:57-nf] does all this by nothing else than by his freedom of will.\" Observe how great a result he has here stated to be accomplished only by our freedom of will; and how, in fact, he supposes us to cleave to God without the help of God: for such is the force of his words, \"by nothing else than by his own freedom of will.\" So that, after we have cleaved to the Lord without His help, we even then, because of such adhesion of our own, deserve to be assisted.

Now all these vast courses of goodness we (according to him) accomplish, forsooth, simply by the freedom of our own free will; and by reason of such antecedent merits we so secure His grace, that He turns our heart which way soever He pleases. Well, now, how is that grace which is not gratuitously conferred? How can it be grace, if it is given in payment of a debt? How can that be true which the apostle says, \"It is not of yourselves, but it is the gift of God; not of works, lest any man should boast;\"[fn-33-P3332_1290473:60-nf] and again, \"If it is of grace, then is it no more of works, otherwise grace is no more grace:\"[fn-33-P3333_1290588:61-nf] how, I repeat, can this be true, if such meritorious works precede as to procure for us the bestowal of grace? Surely, under the circumstances, there can be no gratuitous gift, but only the recompense of a due reward. Is it the case, then, that in order to find their way to the help of God, men run to God without God's help? And in order that we may receive God's help while cleaving to Him, do we without His help cleave to God? What greater gift, or even what similar gift, could grace itself bestow upon any man, if he has already without grace been able to make himself one spirit with the Lord by no other power than that of his own free will?","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_22_book_i_","source_chapter":57,"source_paragraph":"169","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"He ought, moreover, carefully to note that, in the very same context from which he quoted that passage of Ambrose's, which seemed so satisfactory for his purpose, he also said this: \"To be spotless from the beginning is an impossibility to human nature.\"[fn-35-P3504_1341146:139-nf] In this sentence the venerable Ambrose does undoubtedly predicate feebleness and infirmity of that natural \"capacity,\" which Pelagius refuses faithfully to regard as corrupted by sin, and therefore boastfully extols.

Indeed, the most useful thing that has been received by man from God is their philosophy.[fn-30-P3064_1237168:41-nf] They neglect many branches of mathematics and the technicalities of dialectics, because they regard such studies as superfluous, and as a useless expenditure of time, seeing that they contribute nothing towards correct living. They apply themselves exclusively to the cultivation of natural and useful science, in order that they may mitigate, if not eradicate, evil. They invariably refrain from accounting any action or principle as good, which occupies a middle place between virtue and vice, for they delight only in what is good. They regard every man as wicked, who, though he abstain from evil, does not do good. For they do not demonstrate virtue by argument, but practice it, and count as nothing the glory current among men. They manfully subjugate the passions of the soul, yielding neither to the necessities of nature, nor succumbing to the weakness of the body. Having possessed the power of the Divine mind, they always look away to the Creator of the whole, night and day worshiping him, and appeasing him by prayers and supplications. By purity of soul and by a life of good works they entered without guilt upon religious observances, and despised purification, lustral vessels, and such ceremonials; for they think that sins alone are blemishes. They are greater than the external casualties to which we are liable, and hold, as it were, all things under their control: and are not therefore diverted from the path they have selected by the disasters or the necessity which sway the life. They are not distressed when insulted, nor do they defend themselves when suffering from malice; nor do they lose heart when pressed by sickness or lack of necessaries but rather rejoice in such trials and endure then with patience and meekness. They inure themselves through the whole of life to be content with little, and approximate as nearly to God as is possible to human nature. They regard the present life as a journey only, and are not therefore solicitous about acquiring wealth, nor do they provide for the present beyond urgent necessities. They admire the beauty and simplicity of nature, but their hope is placed in heaven and the blessedness of the future. Wholly absorbed in the worship of God, they revolted from obscene language; and as they had banished evil practices, so they would not allow such things to be even named. They limited, as far as possible, the demands of nature, and compelled the body to be satisfied with moderate supplies. They overcame intemperance by temperance, injustice by justice, and falsehood by truth, and attained the happy medium in all things. They dwelt in harmony and fellowship with their neighbors. They provided for their friends and strangers, imparted to those who were in want, according to their need, and comforted the afflicted. As they were diligent in all things, and zealous in seeking the supreme good, their instructions, though clothed in modesty and prudence, and devoid of vain and meritricious eloquence, possessed power, like sovereign medicines, in healing the moral diseases of their audience; they spoke, too, with fear and reverence, and eschewed all strife, raillery, and anger. Indeed, it is but reasonable to suppress all irrational emotions, and to subdue carnal and natural passions. Elias the prophet and John the Baptist were the authors, as some say, of this sublime philosophy. Philo the Pythagorean[fn-30-P3065_1240681:42-nf] relates, that in his time the most virtuous of the Hebrews assembled from all parts of the world, and settled in a tract of country situated on a hill near Lake Mareotis, for the purpose of living as philosophers. He describes their dwellings, their regimen, and their customs, as similar to those which we now meet with among the monks of Egypt. He says that from the moment they began to apply themselves to the study of philosophy, they gave up their property to their relatives, relinquished business and society, and dwelt outside of walls, in fields and in gardens. They had also, he informs us, sacred edifices which were called monasteries, in which they dwelt apart and alone, occupied in celebrating the holy mysteries, and in worshiping God sedulously with psalms and hymns. They never tasted food before sunset, and some only took food every third day, or even at longer intervals. Finally, he says, that on certain days they lay on the ground and abstained from wine and the flesh of animals; that their food wasbread, salt, and hyssop, and their drink, water; and that there were women among them who had lived as virgins to old age, who, for the love of philosophy, and from their voluntary judgment, practiced celibacy. In this narrative, Philo seems to describe[fn-30-P3066_1242012:43-nf] certain Jews who had embraced Christianity, and yet retained the customs of their nation; for no vestiges of this manner of life are to be found elsewhere: and hence I conclude that this philosophy flourished in Egypt from this period. Others, however, assert that this mode of life originated from the persecutions for the sake of religion, which arose from time to time, and by which many were compelled to flee to the mountains and deserts and forests, and they became used to this kind of living.","title":"Book I.","author":"Hermias Sozomen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":33,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_17_book_x","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"50.

The context of the passage containing this clause of which our adversaries make such a bad use, brings out its real meaning. \"The love of Christ,\" we read, \"constrains us, because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then all died; and He died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but to Him who died for them, and rose again. Therefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh; and though we have known Christ after the flesh, ret now henceforth know we Him no more.\" The words, \"that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto Him who died for them, and rose again,\" show plainly that the resurrection of Christ is the ground of the apostle's statement. To live not to themselves, but to Him, must mean to live not after the flesh, in the hope of earthly and perishable goods, but after the spirit, in the hope of resurrection,-a resurrection already accomplished in Christ. Of those, then, for whom Christ died and rose again, and who live henceforth not to themselves, but to Him, the Apostle says that he knows no one after the flesh, on account of the hope of future immortality to which they were looking forward,-a hope which in Christ was already a reality. So, though he has known Christ after the flesh, before His death, now he knows Him no more; for he knows that He has risen, and that death has no more dominion over Him. And because in Christ we all are even now in hope, though not in reality, what Christ is, he adds: \"Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. And all things are of God, who has reconciled us to Himself by Christ.\"[fn-13-P1366_727877:23-nf] What the new creature -that is, the people renewed by faith-hopes for regarding itself, it has already in Christ; and the hope will also hereafter be actually realized. And, as regards this hope, old things have passed away, because we are no longer in the times of the Old Testament, expecting a temporal and carnal kingdom of God; and all things are become new, making the promise of the kingdom of heaven, where there shall be no death or corruption, the ground of our confidence. But in the resurrection of the dead it will not be as a matter of hope, but in reality, that old things shall pass away, when the last enemy, death, shall be destroyed; and all things shall become new when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality. This has already taken place in Christ, whom Paul accordingly, in reality, knew no longer after the flesh. But not yet in reality, but only in hope, did he know no one after the flesh of those for whom Christ died and rose again. For, as he says to the Ephesians, we are already saved by grace. The whole passage is to the purpose: \"But God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, by whose grace we have been saved.\" The words, \"hath quickened us together with Christ,\" correspond to what he said to the Corinthians, \"that they which live should no longer live to themselves, but to Him that died for them and rose again.\" And in the words,\"by whose grace we have been saved,\" he speaks of the thing hoped for as already accomplished. So, in the passage quoted above, he says explicitly, \"We have been saved by hope.\" And here he proceeds to specify future events as if already accomplished. \"And has raised us up together,\" he says, \"and has made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.\" Christ is certainly already seated in heavenly places, but we not yet. But as in an assured hope we already possess the future, he says that we sit in heavenly places, not in ourselves, but in Him. And to show that it is still future, in case it should be thought that what is spoken of as accomplished in hope has been accomplished in reality, he adds, \"that He might show in the ages to come the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness towards us in Christ Jesus.\"[fn-13-P1367_730242:24-nf] So also we must understand the following passage: \"For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.\"[fn-13-P1368_730445:25-nf] He says, \"when we were in the flesh,\" as if they were no longer in the flesh. He means to say, when we were in the hope of fleshly things, referring to the time when the law, which can be fulfilled only by spiritual love, was in force, in order that by transgression the offence might abound, that after the revelation of the New Testament, grace and the gift by grace might much more abound. And to the same effect he says elsewhere, \"They which are in the flesh cannot please God;\" and then, to show that he does not mean those not yet dead, he adds, \"But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit.\"[fn-13-P1369_731066:26-nf] The meaning is, those who are in the hope of fleshly good cannot please God; but you are not in the hope of fleshly things, but in the hope of spiritual things, that is, of the kingdom of heaven, where the body itself, which now is natural, will, by the change in the resurrection, be, according to the capacity of its nature, a spiritual body. For \"it is sown a natural body, it will be raised a spiritual body.\" If, then, the apostle knew no one after the flesh of those who were said to be not in the flesh, because they were not in the hope of fleshly things, although they still were burdened with corruptible and mortal flesh; how much more significantly could he say of Christ that he no longer knew Him after the flesh, seeing that in the body of Christ what they hoped for had already been accomplished! Surely it is better and more reverential to examine the passages of sacred Scripture so as to discover their agreement with one another, than to accept some as true, and condemn others as false, whenever any difficulty occurs beyond the power of our weak intellect to solve. As to the apostle in his childhood understanding as a child, this is said merely as an illustration.[fn-13-P1370_732278:27-nf] And when he was a child he was not a spiritual man, as he was when he produced for the edification of the churches those writings which are not, as other books, merely a profitable study, but which authoritatively claim our belief as part of the ecclesiastical canon.","title":"Book XI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_21_book_iii_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"35","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"Alexander died[fn-33-P3376_1426285:8-nf] about this time, and Paul succeeded to the high priesthood of Constantinople.

Again, every one must be impressed, and be either enlightened or confirmed in the faith, by the blessing of the two sons who honored the nakedness of their father, though they turned away their faces, as displeased with the evil done by the vine. \"Blessed,\" he says, \"be the Lord God of Shem.\" For although God is the God of all nations, even the Gentiles acknowledge Him to be in a peculiar sense the God of Israel. And how is this to be explained but by the blessing of Japhet? The occupation of all the world by the Church among the Gentiles was exactly foretold in the words: \"Let God enlarge Japhet, and let him dwell in the tents of Shem.\" That is for the Manichaean to attend to. You see what the state of the world actually is. The very thing that you are astonished and grieved at in us is this, that God is enlarging Japhet. Is He not dwelling in the tents of Shem?-that is, in the churches built by the apostles, the sons of the prophets. Hear what Paul says to the believing Gentiles: \"Ye were at that time without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants; having no hope of the promise, and without God in the world.\" In these words there is a description of the state of Japhet before he dwelt in the tents of Shem. But observe what follows: \"Now then;\" he says, \"ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God, being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief corner-stone.\"[fn-14-P1443_774064:42-nf] Here we have Japhet enlarged, and dwelling in tile tents of Shem. These testimonies are taken from the epistles of the apostles, which you yourselves acknowledge, and read, and profess to follow. You occupy an unhappy middle position in a building of which Christ is not the chief corner-stone. For you do not belong to the wall of those who, like the apostles, being of the circumcision, believed in Christ; nor to the wall of those who, being of the uncircumcision, like all the Gentiles, are joined in the unity of faith, as in the fellowship of the corner-stone. However, all who accept and read any books of our canon in which Christ is spoken of as having been born and having suffered in the flesh, and who do not unite with us in a common veiling with the sacrament of the mortality, uncovered by the passion, but without the knowledge of piety and charity make known that from which we all are born, -although they differ among themselves, whether as Jews and heretics, or as heretics of one kind or other,-are still all useful to the Church, as being all alike servants, either in bearing witness to or in proving some truth. For of heretics it is said: \"There must be heresies, that those who are approved among you may be manifested.\"[fn-14-P1444_775337:43-nf] Go on, then, with your objections to the Old Testament Scriptures! Go on, ye servants of Ham! You have despised the flesh from which you were born when uncovered. For you could not have called yourselves Christians unless Christ had come into the world, as foretold by the prophets, and had drunk of His own vine that cup which could not pass from Him, and had slept in His passion, as in the drunkenness of the folly which is wiser than men; and so, in the hidden counsel of God, the disclosure had been made of that infirmity of mortal flesh which is stronger than men. For unless the Word of God had taken on Himself this infirmity, the name of Christian, in which you also glory, would not exist in the earth. Go on, then, as I have said. Declare in mockery what we may honor with reverence. Let the Church use you as her servants to make manifest those members who are approved. So particular are the predictions of the prophets regarding the state and the sufferings of the Church, that we can find a place even for you in what is said of the destructive error by which the reprobate are to perish, while the approved are to be manifested.","title":"Book XII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_22_book_iv_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"35","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"The emperor,[fn-35-P3546_1518335:4-nf] deceived by the calumnies of the heterodox, changed his mind, and, in opposition to the decrees of the council of Sardica, exiled the bishops whom he had previously restored.

He was aware of the difficulty of carrying this scheme into execution, arising from the vast extent of land and seas which some of the bishops would have to traverse, yet he did not altogether despair of success. While this project was occupying his mind, and before he prepared to make his triumphal entrance into Rome, he sent for Liberius, the bishop of Rome, and strove to persuade him to conformity of sentiment with the priests by whom he was attended, amongst whom was Eudoxius. As Liberius, however, refused compliance, and protested that he would never yield on this point, the emperor banished him to Beroea, in Thrace. It is alleged, that another pretext for the banishment of Liberius was, that he would not withdraw from communion with Athanasius, but manfully opposed the emperor, who insisted that Athanasius had injured the Church, had occasioned the death of the eider of his two brothers,[fn-36-P3603_1548998:28-nf] and had sown the seeds of enmity between Constans and himself. As the emperor revived all the decrees which had been enacted against Athanasius by various councils, and particularly by that of Tyre, Liberius told him that no regard ought to be paid to edicts which were issued from motives of hatred, of favor, or of fear. He desired that the bishops of every region should be made to sign the formulary of faith compiled at Nicaea, and that those bishops who had been exiled on account of their adherence to it should be recalled. He suggested that after these matters were righted all the bishops should, at their own expense, and without being furnished either with publicconveyances or money, so as not to seem burdensome and destructive, proceed to Alexandria, and make an accurate test of the truth, which could be more easily instituted at that city than elsewhere, as the injured and those who had inflicted injury as well as the confuters of the charges dwelt there. He then exhibited the letter written by Valens and Ursacius to Julius, his predecessor in the Roman see, in which they solicited his forgiveness, and acknowledged that the depositions brought against Athanasius, at the Mareotis, were false; and he besought the emperor not to condemn Athanasius during his absence, nor to give credit to enactments which were evidently obtained by the machinations of his enemies. With respect to the alleged injuries which had been inflicted on his two brothers, he entreated the emperor not to revenge himself by the hands of priests who had been set apart by God, not for the execution of vengeance, but for sanctification, and the performance of just and benevolent actions.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Hermias Sozomen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_22_book_iv_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"59","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"Although what I have recorded did not occur to Athanasius and the church of Alexandria, at the same period of time after the death of Constans, yet I deemed it right, for the sake of greater clearness, to relate all these events collectively.

This was during the consultate of Eusebius and Hypatius. Leonas, who held a brilliant military office at the palace, repaired to this council at the command of Constantius, so that the doctrinal confession might be conducted in his presence. Lauricius, the military governor of the province, was present to prepare whatever might be necessary; for the letter of the emperor had commanded him to render this service. At the first session of this council, several of the bishops were absent, and among others, Patrophilus, bishop of Scythopolis; Macedonius, bishop of Constantinople; and Basil, bishop of Ancyra. They resorted to divers pretexts in justification of their non-attendance. Patrophilus alleged in excuse a complaint in the eyes, and Macedonius pleaded indisposition; but it was suspected they had absented themselves from the fear that various accusations would be brought against them. As the other bishops refused to enter upon the investigation of disputed points during their absence, Leonas commanded them to proceed at once to the examination of the questions that had been agitated. Thus some were others maintained that inquiries ought first to be instituted into the conduct of those among them against whom accusations had been laid, as had been the case with Cyril, bishop of Jerusalem, Eustathius, bishop of Sebaste, and others. The ambiguity of the emperor's letters, which sometimes prescribed one course and sometimes another, gave rise to this dispute. The contention arising from this source became so fierce, that all union was destroyed between them, and they became divided into two parties. However, the advice of those who wished to commence with the examination of doctrine, prevailed. When they proceeded to the investigation of terms, some desired to reject the use of the term \"substance,\" and appealed to the authority of the formulary of faith which had not long previously been compiled by Mark[fn-36-P3683_1603106:55-nf] at Sirmium, and had been received by the bishops who were at the court, among whom was Basil,[fn-36-P3684_1603296:56-nf] bishop of Ancyra. Many others were anxious for the adoption of the formulary of faith drawn up at the dedication of the church of Antioch. To the first of these parties belonged Eudoxius, Acacius, Patrophilus, George, bishop of Alexandria, Uranius, bishop of Tyre, and thirty-two other bishops. The latter party was supported by George, bishop of Laodicea, in Syria; by Eleusius, bishop of Cyzicus; by Sophronius, bishop of Pompeiopolis, in Paphlagonia; with these the majority agreed. It was suspected, and with reason, that Acacius and his partisans absented themselves on account of the difference between their sentiments and those of the aforesaid bishops, and also because they desired to evade the investigation of certain accusations which had been brought against them; for, although they had previously acknowledged in writing to Macedonius, bishop of Constantinople, that the Son is in all respects like unto the Father, and of the same substance, now they fought entirely shy of their former professions. After prolonged disputations and contention, Silvanus, bishop of Tarsus, declared, in a loud and peremptory tone, that no new formulary of faith ought to be introduced but that which had been approved at Antioch, and this alone ought to prevail. As this proposition was repugnant to the followers of Acacius, they withdrew, and the other bishops read the formulary of Antioch. The following day these bishops assembled in the church, closed the doors, and privately confirmed this formulary. Acacius condemned this proceeding, and laid the formulary which he advocated before Leonas and Lauricius privately. Three days afterwards the same bishops reassembled, and were joined by Macedonius and Basil, who had been previously absent. Acacius and his partisans declared that they would take no part in the proceedings of the council until those who had been deposed and accused had quilted the assembly. His demand was complied with; for the bishops of the opposite party were determined that he should have no pretext for dissolving the council, which was evidently his object, in order to prevent the impending examination of the heresy of Aetius, and of the accusations which had been brought against himself and his partisans. When all the members were assembled, Leonas stated that he held a document which had been handed to him by the partisans of Acacius; it was their formulary of faith, with introductory remarks. None of the other bishops knew anything about it; for Leonas, who was of the same sentiment as Acacius, had willingly kept the whole matter a secret. When this document[fn-36-P3685_1605924:57-nf] was read, the whole assembly was filled with tumult; for some of the statements it contained were to the effect that, though the emperor had prohibited the introduction of any term into the formularies of filth which was not found in the Sacred Scriptures, yet that bishops who had been deposed, having been brought from various provinces to the assembly, with others who had been illegally ordained, the council had been thrown into confusion, and that some of the members had been insulted, and others prevented from speaking. It was added that Acacius and his partisans did not reject the formulary which had been compiled at Antioch, although those who had assembled in that city had drawn it up for the express purpose of meeting the difficulty which had just then arisen; but that, as the terms \"consubstantial\" and \"of similar substance\" had grieved some individuals, and that; as it had been recently asserted that the Son is dissimilar from the Father, it was necessary, on this account, to reject the terms \"consubstantial\" and a \"similar substance,\" which do not occur in Scripture, to condemn the term \"dissimilar,\" and to confess clearly that the Son is like unto the Father; for He is, as the Apostle Paul somewhere says, \"the image of the invisible God.\" These prefatory observations were followed by a formulary, which was neither conformable with that of Nicaea, nor with that of Antioch, and which was so artfully worded that the followers of Arius and of Aetius would not appear to be in error if they should thus state their faith. In this formulary, the words used by those who had convened at Nicaea, in condemnation of the Arian doctrine, were omitted, and the declarations of the council of Antioch, concerning the immutability of the Deity of the Son, and concerning His being the unchangeable image of the substance, the counsel, and the power, and the glory of the Father, were passed over in silence, and belief was simply expressed in the Father, in the Son, and in the Holy Ghost; and after bestowing some vulgar epithets on a few individuals who had never entered into any doctrinal contention on one side or the other, all those who entertained any other opinions than those set forth in this formulary were declared to be aliens to the Catholic Church. Such were the contents of the document presented by Leonas, and which had been signed by Acacius, and by those who had adopted his sentiments. After it had been read, Sophronius, a bishop of Paphlagonia, exclaimed, \"If we daily receive the opinions of individuals as a statement of the faith, we shall fail in attaining precision of the truth.\" Acacius having retorted that it was not forbidden to compile new formularies, as that of Nicaea had been once and frequently altered, Eleusius replied as follows: \"But the council has not now met for the purpose of learning what is already known, or of accepting any other formulary than that which has been already approved by those who assembled at Antioch; and, moreover, living and dying, we will adhere to this formulary.\" The dispute having taken this turn, they entered upon another inquiry, and asked the partisans of Acacius, in what they considered the Son to be like unto the Father. They replied that the Son is similar in will only, but not in substance, and the others thereupon insisted that He is similar in substance, and convicted Acacius, by a work which he had formerly written, that he had once been of their opinion. Acacius replied that he ought not to be judged from his own writings; and the dispute had continued with heat for some time, when Eleusius, bishop of Cyzicus, spoke as follows: \"It matters little to the council whether Mark or Basil has transgressed in any way, whether they or the adherents of Acacius have any accusation to bring against each other; neither does the trouble devolve upon the council of examining whether their formulary be commendable or otherwise; it is enough to maintain the formulary which has been already confirmed at Antioch by ninety-seven priests; and if any one desire to introduce any doctrine which is not contained therein, he ought to beheld as an alien to religion and the Church.\" Those who were of his sentiments applauded his speech; and the assembly then arose and separated. The following day, the partisans of Acacius and of George refused to attend the council; and Leonas, who had now openly declared himself to be of their sentiments, likewise refused, in spite of all entreaties, to repair thither. Those who were deputed to request his attendance found the partisans of Acacius in his house; and he declined their invitation, under the plea that too much discord prevailed in the council, and that he had only been commanded by the emperor to attend the council in case of unanimity among the members. Much time was consumed in this way; and the partisans of Acacius were frequently solicited by the other bishops to attend the assemblies; but they sometimes demanded a special conference in the house of Leonas, and sometimes alleged that they had been commissioned by the emperor to judge those who had been accused; for they would not receive the creed adopted by the other bishops, nor clear themselves of the crimes of which they had been accused; neither would they examine the case of Cyril, whom they had deposed; and there was no one to compel them to do so. The council, however, eventually deposed George, bishop of Alexandria; Acacius, bishop of Caesarea; Uranius, bishop of Tyre; Patrophilus, bishop of Scythopolis; and Eudoxius, bishop of Antioch; and several other prelates. Many persons were likewise put out of communion until they could purge themselves of the crimes imputed to them. The transactions were conveyed in writing to the parish of each of the clergy. Adrian,[fn-36-P3686_1611757:58-nf] a presbyter of Antioch, was ordained bishop over that church, in room of Eudoxius; but the partisans of Acacius arrested him and delivered him over to Leonas and Lauricius.

This was during the consultate of Eusebius and Hypatius. Leonas, who held a brilliant military office at the palace, repaired to this council at the command of Constantius, so that the doctrinal confession might be conducted in his presence. Lauricius, the military governor of the province, was present to prepare whatever might be necessary; for the letter of the emperor had commanded him to render this service. At the first session of this council, several of the bishops were absent, and among others, Patrophilus, bishop of Scythopolis; Macedonius, bishop of Constantinople; and Basil, bishop of Ancyra. They resorted to divers pretexts in justification of their non-attendance. Patrophilus alleged in excuse a complaint in the eyes, and Macedonius pleaded indisposition; but it was suspected they had absented themselves from the fear that various accusations would be brought against them. As the other bishops refused to enter upon the investigation of disputed points during their absence, Leonas commanded them to proceed at once to the examination of the questions that had been agitated. Thus some were others maintained that inquiries ought first to be instituted into the conduct of those among them against whom accusations had been laid, as had been the case with Cyril, bishop of Jerusalem, Eustathius, bishop of Sebaste, and others. The ambiguity of the emperor's letters, which sometimes prescribed one course and sometimes another, gave rise to this dispute. The contention arising from this source became so fierce, that all union was destroyed between them, and they became divided into two parties. However, the advice of those who wished to commence with the examination of doctrine, prevailed. When they proceeded to the investigation of terms, some desired to reject the use of the term \"substance,\" and appealed to the authority of the formulary of faith which had not long previously been compiled by Mark[fn-36-P3683_1603106:55-nf] at Sirmium, and had been received by the bishops who were at the court, among whom was Basil,[fn-36-P3684_1603296:56-nf] bishop of Ancyra. Many others were anxious for the adoption of the formulary of faith drawn up at the dedication of the church of Antioch. To the first of these parties belonged Eudoxius, Acacius, Patrophilus, George, bishop of Alexandria, Uranius, bishop of Tyre, and thirty-two other bishops. The latter party was supported by George, bishop of Laodicea, in Syria; by Eleusius, bishop of Cyzicus; by Sophronius, bishop of Pompeiopolis, in Paphlagonia; with these the majority agreed. It was suspected, and with reason, that Acacius and his partisans absented themselves on account of the difference between their sentiments and those of the aforesaid bishops, and also because they desired to evade the investigation of certain accusations which had been brought against them; for, although they had previously acknowledged in writing to Macedonius, bishop of Constantinople, that the Son is in all respects like unto the Father, and of the same substance, now they fought entirely shy of their former professions. After prolonged disputations and contention, Silvanus, bishop of Tarsus, declared, in a loud and peremptory tone, that no new formulary of faith ought to be introduced but that which had been approved at Antioch, and this alone ought to prevail. As this proposition was repugnant to the followers of Acacius, they withdrew, and the other bishops read the formulary of Antioch. The following day these bishops assembled in the church, closed the doors, and privately confirmed this formulary. Acacius condemned this proceeding, and laid the formulary which he advocated before Leonas and Lauricius privately. Three days afterwards the same bishops reassembled, and were joined by Macedonius and Basil, who had been previously absent. Acacius and his partisans declared that they would take no part in the proceedings of the council until those who had been deposed and accused had quilted the assembly. His demand was complied with; for the bishops of the opposite party were determined that he should have no pretext for dissolving the council, which was evidently his object, in order to prevent the impending examination of the heresy of Aetius, and of the accusations which had been brought against himself and his partisans. When all the members were assembled, Leonas stated that he held a document which had been handed to him by the partisans of Acacius; it was their formulary of faith, with introductory remarks. None of the other bishops knew anything about it; for Leonas, who was of the same sentiment as Acacius, had willingly kept the whole matter a secret. When this document[fn-36-P3685_1605924:57-nf] was read, the whole assembly was filled with tumult; for some of the statements it contained were to the effect that, though the emperor had prohibited the introduction of any term into the formularies of filth which was not found in the Sacred Scriptures, yet that bishops who had been deposed, having been brought from various provinces to the assembly, with others who had been illegally ordained, the council had been thrown into confusion, and that some of the members had been insulted, and others prevented from speaking. It was added that Acacius and his partisans did not reject the formulary which had been compiled at Antioch, although those who had assembled in that city had drawn it up for the express purpose of meeting the difficulty which had just then arisen; but that, as the terms \"consubstantial\" and \"of similar substance\" had grieved some individuals, and that; as it had been recently asserted that the Son is dissimilar from the Father, it was necessary, on this account, to reject the terms \"consubstantial\" and a \"similar substance,\" which do not occur in Scripture, to condemn the term \"dissimilar,\" and to confess clearly that the Son is like unto the Father; for He is, as the Apostle Paul somewhere says, \"the image of the invisible God.\" These prefatory observations were followed by a formulary, which was neither conformable with that of Nicaea, nor with that of Antioch, and which was so artfully worded that the followers of Arius and of Aetius would not appear to be in error if they should thus state their faith. In this formulary, the words used by those who had convened at Nicaea, in condemnation of the Arian doctrine, were omitted, and the declarations of the council of Antioch, concerning the immutability of the Deity of the Son, and concerning His being the unchangeable image of the substance, the counsel, and the power, and the glory of the Father, were passed over in silence, and belief was simply expressed in the Father, in the Son, and in the Holy Ghost; and after bestowing some vulgar epithets on a few individuals who had never entered into any doctrinal contention on one side or the other, all those who entertained any other opinions than those set forth in this formulary were declared to be aliens to the Catholic Church. Such were the contents of the document presented by Leonas, and which had been signed by Acacius, and by those who had adopted his sentiments. After it had been read, Sophronius, a bishop of Paphlagonia, exclaimed, \"If we daily receive the opinions of individuals as a statement of the faith, we shall fail in attaining precision of the truth.\" Acacius having retorted that it was not forbidden to compile new formularies, as that of Nicaea had been once and frequently altered, Eleusius replied as follows: \"But the council has not now met for the purpose of learning what is already known, or of accepting any other formulary than that which has been already approved by those who assembled at Antioch; and, moreover, living and dying, we will adhere to this formulary.\" The dispute having taken this turn, they entered upon another inquiry, and asked the partisans of Acacius, in what they considered the Son to be like unto the Father. They replied that the Son is similar in will only, but not in substance, and the others thereupon insisted that He is similar in substance, and convicted Acacius, by a work which he had formerly written, that he had once been of their opinion. Acacius replied that he ought not to be judged from his own writings; and the dispute had continued with heat for some time, when Eleusius, bishop of Cyzicus, spoke as follows: \"It matters little to the council whether Mark or Basil has transgressed in any way, whether they or the adherents of Acacius have any accusation to bring against each other; neither does the trouble devolve upon the council of examining whether their formulary be commendable or otherwise; it is enough to maintain the formulary which has been already confirmed at Antioch by ninety-seven priests; and if any one desire to introduce any doctrine which is not contained therein, he ought to beheld as an alien to religion and the Church.\" Those who were of his sentiments applauded his speech; and the assembly then arose and separated. The following day, the partisans of Acacius and of George refused to attend the council; and Leonas, who had now openly declared himself to be of their sentiments, likewise refused, in spite of all entreaties, to repair thither. Those who were deputed to request his attendance found the partisans of Acacius in his house; and he declined their invitation, under the plea that too much discord prevailed in the council, and that he had only been commanded by the emperor to attend the council in case of unanimity among the members. Much time was consumed in this way; and the partisans of Acacius were frequently solicited by the other bishops to attend the assemblies; but they sometimes demanded a special conference in the house of Leonas, and sometimes alleged that they had been commissioned by the emperor to judge those who had been accused; for they would not receive the creed adopted by the other bishops, nor clear themselves of the crimes of which they had been accused; neither would they examine the case of Cyril, whom they had deposed; and there was no one to compel them to do so. The council, however, eventually deposed George, bishop of Alexandria; Acacius, bishop of Caesarea; Uranius, bishop of Tyre; Patrophilus, bishop of Scythopolis; and Eudoxius, bishop of Antioch; and several other prelates. Many persons were likewise put out of communion until they could purge themselves of the crimes imputed to them. The transactions were conveyed in writing to the parish of each of the clergy.

These prelates having assembled together, in number about fifty, they confirmed the formulary read at the council of Ariminum, adding this provision, that the terms \"substance \" and \"hypostasis\" should never again be used in reference to God. They also declared that all other formularies set forth in times past, as likewise those that might be compiled at any future period, should be condemned. They then deposed Aetius from his office of deacon, because he had written works full of contention and of a species of vain knowledge opposed to the ecclesiastical vocation; because he had used in writing and in disputation several impious expressions; and because he had been the occasion of troubles and seditions in the Church. It was alleged by many that they did not depose him willingly, but merely because they wished to remove all suspicion from the mind of the emperor which be had with regard to them, for they had been accused of holding Aetian views. Those who held these sentiments took advantage of the resentment with which, for reasons above mentioned, the emperor regarded Macedonius, and they accordingly deposed him, and likewise Eleusius, bishop of Cyzicus; Basil, bishop of Ancyra; Heortasius, bishop of Sardis; and Dracontius, bishop of Pergamus. Although they differed about doctrine from those bishops, yet in deposing them, no blame was thrown upon their faith, but charges were alleged against them in common with all, that they had disturbed the peace and violated the laws of the Church. They specified, in particular, that when the presbyter Diogenes was traveling from Alexandria to Ancyra, Basil seized his papers, and struck him; they also deposed that Basil had, without trial, delivered over many of the clergy from Antioch, from the banks of the Euphrates, and from Cilicia, Galatia, and Asia, to the rulers of the provinces, to be exiled and subjected to cruel punishments, so that many had been loaded with chains, and had been compelled to bribe the soldiers, who were conducting them away, not to ill-use them. They added that, on one occasion, when the emperor had commanded Aetius and some of his followers to be led before Cecropius, that they might answer to him for various accusations laid to their charge, Basil recommended the person who was intrusted with the execution of this edict, to act according to the dictates of his own judgment. They said that he wrote directions to Hermogenes,[fn-37-P3701_1620345:64-nf] the prefect and governor of Syria, stating who were to be banished, and whither they were to be sent; and that, when the exiles were recalled by the emperor, he would not consent to their return, but opposed himself to the wishes of the rulers and of the priests. They further deposed that Basil had excited the clergy of Sirimium against Germanius; and that, although he stated in writing that he had admitted Germanius, Valens, and Ursacius into communion, he had placed them as criminals before the tribunal of the African bishops; and that, when taxed with this deed, he had denied it, and perjured himself; and that, when he was afterwards convicted, he strove to justify his perjury by sophistical reasoning. They added, that he had been the cause of contention and of sedition in Illyria, Italy, Africa, and in the Roman church; that he had thrown a servant into prison to compel her to bear false witness against her mistress; hat he had baptized a man of loose life, who lived in illicit intercourse with a woman, and had promoted him to be a deacon; that he had neglected to excommunicate a quack-doctor who had occasioned the death of several persons; and that he and some of the clergy had bound themselves by oath before the holy table, not to bring accusations against each other. This, they said, was an artifice adopted by the president of the clergy to shield himself from the accusations of his plaintiffs. In short, such were the reasons they specified for the deposition of Basil. Eustathius, they said, was deposed because, when a presbyter, he had been condemned, and put away from the communion of prayers by Eulalius, his own father, who was bishop of the church of Caesarea, in Cappadocia; and also because he had been excommunicated by a council held at Neocaesarea, a city of Pontus, and deposed by Eusebius, bishop of Constantinople, for unfaithfulness in the discharge of certain duties that had devolved upon him. He had also been deprived of his bishopric by those who were convened in Gangroe, on account of his having taught, acted, and thought contrary to sound doctrine. He had been convicted of perjury by the council of Antioch. He had likewise endeavored to reverse the decrees of those convened at Melitina; and, although he was guilty of many crimes, he had the assurance to aspire to be judge over the others, and to stigmatize them as heretics. They deposed Eleusius because he had raised inconsiderately one Heraclius, a native of Tyre, to be a deacon; this man had been a priest of Hercules at Tyre, had been accused of and tried for sorcery, and, therefore, had retired to Cyzicus and feigned conversion to Christianity; and moreover, Eleusius, after having been apprised of these circumstances, had not driven him from the Church. He had also, without inquiry, ordained certain individuals, who had come to Cyzicus, after they had been condemned by Maris, bishop of Chalcedonia, who participated in this council. Heortasius was deposed because he had been ordained bishop of Sardis without the sanction of the bishops of Lydia. They deposed Dracontius, bishop of Pergamus, because he had previously held another bishopric in Galatia, and because, they stated, he had on both occasions been unlawfully ordained. After these transactions, a second assembly of the council was held, and Silvanus, bishop of Tarsus, Sophronius, bishop of Pompeiopolis in Paphlagonia, Elpidius, bishop of Satala, and Neonas, bishop of Seleucia in Isauria, were deposed. The reason they assigned for the deposition of Silvanus was, that he had constituted himself the leader of a foolish party in Seleucia and Constantinople;he had, besides, constituted Theophilus as president of the church of Castabala, who had been previously ordained bishop of Eleutheropolis by the bishops of Palestine, and who had promised upon oath that he would never accept any other bishopric without their permission.

These prelates having assembled together, in number about fifty, they confirmed the formulary read at the council of Ariminum, adding this provision, that the terms \"substance \" and \"hypostasis\" should never again be used in reference to God. They also declared that all other formularies set forth in times past, as likewise those that might be compiled at any future period, should be condemned. They then deposed Aetius from his office of deacon, because he had written works full of contention and of a species of vain knowledge opposed to the ecclesiastical vocation; because he had used in writing and in disputation several impious expressions; and because he had been the occasion of troubles and seditions in the Church. It was alleged by many that they did not depose him willingly, but merely because they wished to remove all suspicion from the mind of the emperor which be had with regard to them, for they had been accused of holding Aetian views. Those who held these sentiments took advantage of the resentment with which, for reasons above mentioned, the emperor regarded Macedonius, and they accordingly deposed him, and likewise Eleusius, bishop of Cyzicus; Basil, bishop of Ancyra; Heortasius, bishop of Sardis; and Dracontius, bishop of Pergamus. Although they differed about doctrine from those bishops, yet in deposing them, no blame was thrown upon their faith, but charges were alleged against them in common with all, that they had disturbed the peace and violated the laws of the Church. They specified, in particular, that when the presbyter Diogenes was traveling from Alexandria to Ancyra, Basil seized his papers, and struck him; they also deposed that Basil had, without trial, delivered over many of the clergy from Antioch, from the banks of the Euphrates, and from Cilicia, Galatia, and Asia, to the rulers of the provinces, to be exiled and subjected to cruel punishments, so that many had been loaded with chains, and had been compelled to bribe the soldiers, who were conducting them away, not to ill-use them. They added that, on one occasion, when the emperor had commanded Aetius and some of his followers to be led before Cecropius, that they might answer to him for various accusations laid to their charge, Basil recommended the person who was intrusted with the execution of this edict, to act according to the dictates of his own judgment. They said that he wrote directions to Hermogenes,[fn-37-P3701_1620345:64-nf] the prefect and governor of Syria, stating who were to be banished, and whither they were to be sent; and that, when the exiles were recalled by the emperor, he would not consent to their return, but opposed himself to the wishes of the rulers and of the priests. They further deposed that Basil had excited the clergy of Sirimium against Germanius; and that, although he stated in writing that he had admitted Germanius, Valens, and Ursacius into communion, he had placed them as criminals before the tribunal of the African bishops; and that, when taxed with this deed, he had denied it, and perjured himself; and that, when he was afterwards convicted, he strove to justify his perjury by sophistical reasoning. They added, that he had been the cause of contention and of sedition in Illyria, Italy, Africa, and in the Roman church; that he had thrown a servant into prison to compel her to bear false witness against her mistress; hat he had baptized a man of loose life, who lived in illicit intercourse with a woman, and had promoted him to be a deacon; that he had neglected to excommunicate a quack-doctor who had occasioned the death of several persons; and that he and some of the clergy had bound themselves by oath before the holy table, not to bring accusations against each other. This, they said, was an artifice adopted by the president of the clergy to shield himself from the accusations of his plaintiffs. In short, such were the reasons they specified for the deposition of Basil. Eustathius, they said, was deposed because, when a presbyter, he had been condemned, and put away from the communion of prayers by Eulalius, his own father, who was bishop of the church of Caesarea, in Cappadocia; and also because he had been excommunicated by a council held at Neocaesarea, a city of Pontus, and deposed by Eusebius, bishop of Constantinople, for unfaithfulness in the discharge of certain duties that had devolved upon him. He had also been deprived of his bishopric by those who were convened in Gangroe, on account of his having taught, acted, and thought contrary to sound doctrine. He had been convicted of perjury by the council of Antioch. He had likewise endeavored to reverse the decrees of those convened at Melitina; and, although he was guilty of many crimes, he had the assurance to aspire to be judge over the others, and to stigmatize them as heretics. They deposed Eleusius because he had raised inconsiderately one Heraclius, a native of Tyre, to be a deacon; this man had been a priest of Hercules at Tyre, had been accused of and tried for sorcery, and, therefore, had retired to Cyzicus and feigned conversion to Christianity; and moreover, Eleusius, after having been apprised of these circumstances, had not driven him from the Church. He had also, without inquiry, ordained certain individuals, who had come to Cyzicus, after they had been condemned by Maris, bishop of Chalcedonia, who participated in this council. Heortasius was deposed because he had been ordained bishop of Sardis without the sanction of the bishops of Lydia. They deposed Dracontius, bishop of Pergamus, because he had previously held another bishopric in Galatia, and because, they stated, he had on both occasions been unlawfully ordained. After these transactions, a second assembly of the council was held, and Silvanus, bishop of Tarsus, Sophronius, bishop of Pompeiopolis in Paphlagonia, Elpidius, bishop of Satala, and Neonas, bishop of Seleucia in Isauria, were deposed. The reason they assigned for the deposition of Silvanus was, that he had constituted himself the leader of a foolish party in Seleucia and Constantinople;he had, besides, constituted Theophilus as president of the church of Castabala, who had been previously ordained bishop of Eleutheropolis by the bishops of Palestine, and who had promised upon oath that he would never accept any other bishopric without their permission. Sophronius was deposed on account of his avarice, and on account of his having sold some of the offerings presented to the church, for his own profit; besides, after he had received a first and second summons to appear before the council, he could, at last, be scarcely induced to make his appearance, and then, instead of replying to the accusations brought against him, he appealed to other judges.

And inasmuch as there are three things of which man consists,-namely, spirit, soul, and body,-which again are spoken of as two, because frequently the soul is named along with the spirit; for a certain rational portion of the same, of which beasts are devoid, is called spirit: the principal part in us is the spirit; next, the life whereby we are united with the body is called the soul; finally, the body itself, as it is visible, is the last part in us. This \"whole creation\" (creatura), however, \"groaneth and travaileth until now.\"[fn-33-P3307_1516831:117-nf] Nevertheless, He has given it the first-fruits of the Spirit, in that it has believed God, and is now of a good will.[fn-33-P3308_1516971:118-nf] This spirit is also called the mind, regarding which an apostle speaks thus: \"With the mind I serve the law of God.\"[fn-33-P3309_1517264:119-nf] Which apostle likewise expresses himself thus in another passage: \"For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit.\"[fn-33-P3310_1517403:120-nf] Moreover, the soul, when as yet it lusts after carnal good things, is called the flesh. For a certain part thereof resists[fn-33-P3311_1517544:121-nf] the Spirit, not in virtue of nature, but in virtue of the custom of sins; whence it is said, \"With the mind I serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.\" And this custom has been turned into a nature, according to mortal generation, by the sin of the first man. Consequently it is also written in this wise, \"And we were sometime by nature the children of wrath,\"[fn-33-P3312_1518089:122-nf] that is, of vengeance, through which it has come to pass that we serve the law of sin. The nature of the soul, however, is perfect when it is made subject to its own spirit, and when it follows that spirit as the same follows God. Therefore \"the animal man[fn-33-P3313_1518365:123-nf] receiveth not the things which are of the Spirit of God.\"[fn-33-P3314_1518474:124-nf] But the soul is not so speedily subdued to the spirit unto good action, as is the spirit to God unto true faith and goodwill; but sometimes its impetus, whereby it moves downwards into things carnal and temporal, is more tardily bridled. But inasmuch as this same soul is also made pure, and receives the stability of its own nature, under the dominance of the spirit, which is the head for it, which head of the said soul has again its own head in Christ, we ought not to despair of the restoration of the body also to its own proper nature. But this certainly will not be effected so speedily as is the case with the soul; just as the soul too, is not restored so speedily as the spirit. Yet it will take place in the appropriate season, at the last trump, when \"the dead shall rise uncorrupted, and we shall be changed.\"[fn-33-P3315_1519321:125-nf] And accordingly we believe also in The Resurrection of the Flesh, to wit, not merely that that soul, which at present by reason of carnal affections is called the flesh, is restored; but that it shall be so likewise with this visible flesh, which is the flesh according to nature, the name of which has been received by the soul, not in virtue of nature, but in reference to carnal affections: this visible flesh, then, I say, which is the flesh properly so called, must without doubt be believed to be destined to rise again. For the Apostle Paul appears to point to this, as it were, with his finger, when he says, \"This corruptible must put on incorruption.\"[fn-33-P3316_1520005:126-nf] For when he says this, he, as it were, directs his finger toward it. Now it is that which is visible that admits of being pointed out with the finger; since the soul might also have been called corruptible, for it is itself corrupted by vices of manners. And when it is read, \"and this mortal [must] put on immortality,\" the same visible flesh is signified, inasmuch as at it ever and anon the finger is thus as it were pointed. For the soul also may thus in like manner be called mortal, even as it is designated corruptible in reference to vices of manners. For assuredly it is \"the death of the soul to apostatize from God;\"[fn-33-P3317_1520655:127-nf] which is its first sin in Paradise, as it is contained in the sacred writings.","title":"Introductory Notice.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_11_homily_iii_on_the_firmament_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"Now we must say something about the nature of the firmament, and why it received I the order to hold the middle place between thewaters. Scripture constantly makes use of the word firmament to express extraordinary strength. \"The Lord in firmament and refuge\"[fn-21-P2140_634011:11-nf] \"I have strengthened the pillars of it\"[fn-21-P2141_634075:12-nf] \"Praise him in the firmament of his power.\"[fn-21-P2142_634142:13-nf] The heathen writers thus call a strong body one which is compact and full,[fn-21-P2143_634238:14-nf] to distinguish it from the mathematical body. A mathematical body is a body which exists only in the three dimensions, breadths depth, and height. A firm body, on the contrary, adds resistance to the dimensions. It is the custom of Scripture to call firmament all that is strong and unyielding. It even uses the word to denote the condensation of the air: He, it says, who strengthens the thunder.[fn-21-P2144_634756:15-nf] Scripture means by the strengthening of the thunder, the strength and resistance of the wind, which, enclosed in the hollows of the clouds, produces the noise of thunder when it breaks through with violence.[fn-21-P2145_634987:16-nf] Here then, according to me, is a firm substance, capable of retaining the fluid and unstable element water; and as, according to the common acceptation, it appears that the firmament owes its origin to water, we must not believe that it resembles frozen water or any other matter produced by the filtration of water; as, for example, rock crystal, which is said to owe its metamorphosis to excessive congelation,[fn-21-P2146_635667:17-nf] or the transparent stone[fn-21-P2147_636266:18-nf] which forms in mines.[fn-21-P2148_636413:19-nf] This pellucid stone, if one finds it in its natural perfection, without cracks inside, or the least spot of corruption, almost rivals the air in clearness. We cannot compare the firmament to one of these substances. To hold such an opinion about celestial bodies would be childish and foolish; and although everything may be in everything, fire in earth, air in water, anti of the other elements the one in the other; although none of those which come under our senses are pure and without mixture, either with the element which serves as a medium for it, or with that which is contrary to it; I, nevertheless, dare not affirm that the firmament was formed of one of these simple substances, or of a mixture of them, for I am taught by Scripture not to allow my imagination to wander too far afield. But do not let us forget to remark that, after these divine words \"let there be a firmament,\" it is not said \"and the firmament was reader\" but, \"and God made the firmament, and divided the waters.\"[fn-21-P2149_637511:20-nf] Hear, O ye deaf! See, O ye blind!-who, then, is deaf? He who does not hear this startling voice of the Holy Spirit. Who is blind? He who does not see such clear proofs of the Only begotten.[fn-21-P2150_637717:21-nf] \"Let there be a firmament.\" It is the voice of the primary and principal Cause. \"And God made the firmament.\" Here is a witness to the active and creative power of God.","title":"Homily III.-On the Firmament.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":2,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_31_the_epistle_of_ignatius_to_the_philippians","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"26","folder":"ANF-01","text":"And indeed, before the cross was erected, he (Satan) was eager that it should be so; and he \"wrought\" [for this end] \"in the children of disobedience.\"[fn-28-P2885_465903:25-nf] He wrought in Judas, in the Pharisees, in the Sadducees, in the old, in the young, and in the priests.

But when \"they shall by and by come and say, I am Christ,\"[fn-68-P6889_2005354:1536-nf] they will be received by you, who have already received one altogether like them.[fn-68-P6890_2005458:1537-nf] Christ, however, comes in His own name. What will you do, then, when He Himself comes who is the very Proprietor of these names, the Creator's Christ and Jesus? Will you reject Him? But how iniquitous, how unjust and disrespectful to the good God, that you should not receive Him who comes in His own name, when you have received another in His name! Now, let us see what are the signs which He ascribes to the times. \"Wars,\" I observe, \"and kingdom against kingdom, and nation against nation, and pestilence, and famines, and earthquakes, and fearful sights, and great signs from heaven\"[fn-68-P6891_2006143:1538-nf] -all which things are suitable for a severe and terrible God. Now, when He goes on to say that \"all these things must needs come to pass,\"[fn-68-P6892_2006307:1539-nf] what does He represent Himself to be? The Destroyer, or the Defender of the Creator? For He affirms thai these appointments of His must fully come to pass; but surely as the good God, He would have frustrated rather than advanced events so sad and terrible, if they had not been His own (decrees). \"But before all these,\" He foretells that persecutions and sufferings were to come upon them, which indeed were \"to turn for a testimony to them,\" and for their salvation.[fn-68-P6893_2006846:1540-nf] Hear what is predicted in Zechariah: \"The Lord of hosts[fn-68-P6894_2006926:1541-nf] shall protect them; and they shall devour them, and subdue them with sling-stones; and they shall drink their blood like wine, and they shall fill the bowls as it were of the altar. And the Lord shall save them in that day, even His people, like sheep; because as sacred stones they roll,\"[fn-68-P6895_2007273:1542-nf] etc. And that you may not suppose that these predictions refer to such sufferings as await them from so many wars with strangers,[fn-68-P6896_2007443:1543-nf] consider the nature (of the sufferings). In a prophecy of wars which were to be waged with legitimate arms, no one would think of enumerating stones as weapons, which are better known in popular crowds and unarmed tumults. Nobody measures the copious streams of blood which flow in war by bowlfuls, nor limits it to what is shed upon a single altar. No one gives the name of sheep to those who fall in battle with arms in hand, and while repelling force with force, but only to those who are slain, yielding themselves up in their own place of duty and with patience, rather than fighting in self-defence. In short, as he says, \"they roll as sacred stones,\" and not like soldiers fight. Stones are they, even foundation stones, upon which we are ourselves edified-\"built,\" as St. Paul says, \"upon the foundation of the apostles,\"[fn-68-P6897_2008294:1544-nf] who, like \"consecrated stones,\" were rolled up and down exposed to the attack of all men. And therefore in this passage He forbids men \"to meditate before what they answer\" when brought before tribunals,[fn-68-P6898_2008520:1545-nf] even as once He suggested to Balaam the message which he had not thought of,[fn-68-P6899_2008623:1546-nf] nay, contrary to what he had thought; and promised \"a mouth\" to Moses, when he pleaded in excuse the slowness of his speech,[fn-69-P6900_2008774:1547-nf] and that wisdom which, by Isaiah, He showed to be irresistible: \"One shall say, I am the Lord's, and shall call himself by the name of Jacob, and another shall subscribe himself by the name of lsrµl.\"[fn-69-P6901_2008999:1548-nf] Now, what plea is wiser and more irresistible than the simple and open\"[fn-69-P6902_2009094:1549-nf] confession made in a martyr's cause, who \"prevails with God\"-which is what \"Israel\" means?[fn-69-P6903_2009202:1550-nf] Now, one cannot wonder that He forbade \"premeditation,\" who actually Himself received from the Father the ability of uttering words in season: \"The Lord hath given to me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season (to him that is weary); \"[fn-69-P6904_2009503:1551-nf] except that Marcion introduces to us a Christ who is not subject to the Father. That persecutions from one's nearest friends are predicted, and calumny out of hatred to His name,[fn-69-P6905_2009702:1552-nf] I need not again refer to. But \"by patience,\"[fn-69-P6906_2009775:1553-nf] says He, \"ye shall yourselves be saved.\"[fn-69-P6907_2009855:1554-nf] Of this very patience the Psalm says, \"The patient endurance of the just shall not perish for ever; \"[fn-69-P6908_2010006:1555-nf] because it is said in another Psalm, \"Precious (in the sight of the Lord) is the death of the just\"-arising, no doubt, out of their patient endurance, so that Zechariah declares: \"A crown shall be to them that endure.\"[fn-69-P6909_2010246:1556-nf] But that you may not boldly contend that it was as announcers of another god that the apostles were persecuted by the Jews, remember that even the prophets suffered the same treatment of the Jews, and that they were not the heralds of any other god than the Creator.

Now that the words addressed to Mary are not applicable to the Godhead of the Only-begotten, one may learn from the intention with which they were uttered. For He Who humbled Himself to a level with human littleness, He it is Who spake the words. And what is the meaning of what He then uttered, they may know in all its fulness who by the Spirit search out the depths of the sacred mystery. But as much as comes within our compass we will set down in few words, following the guidance of the Fathers. He Who is by nature Father of existent things, from Whom all things have their birth, has been proclaimed as one, by the sublime utterance of the Apostle. \"For there is one God,\" he says, \"and Father, of Whom are all things[fn-20-P2094_1268713:8-nf] .\" Accordingly human nature did not enter into the creation from any other source, nor grow spontaneously in the parents of the race, but it too had for the author of its own constitution none other than the Father of all. And the name of Godhead itself, whether it indicates the authority of oversight or of foresight[fn-20-P2095_1269055:9-nf] , imports a certain relation to humanity. For He Who bestowed on all things that are, the power of being, is the God and overseer of what He has Himself produced. But since, by the wiles of him that sowed in us the tares of disobedience, our nature no longer preserved in itself the impress of the Father's image, but was transformed into the foul likeness of sin, for this cause it was engrafted by virtue of similarity of will into the evil family of the father of sin: so that the good and true God and Father was no longer the God and Father of him who had been thus outlawed by his own depravity, but instead of Him Who was by Nature God, those were honoured who, as the Apostle says, \"by nature were no Gods[fn-20-P2096_1269960:10-nf] ,\" and in the place of the Father, he was deemed father who is falsely so called, as the prophet Jeremiah says in his dark saying, \"The partridge called, she gathered together what she hatched not[fn-20-P2097_1270174:11-nf] .\" Since, then, this was the sum of our calamity, that humanity was exiled from the good Father, and was banished from the Divine oversight and care, for this cause He Who is the Shepherd of the whole rational creation, left in the heights of heaven His unsinning and supramundane flock, and, moved by love, went after the sheep which had gone astray, even our human nature[fn-20-P2098_1270575:12-nf] . For human nature, which alone, according to the similitude in the parable, through vice roamed away from the hundred of rational beings, is, if it be compared with the whole, but an insignificant and infinitesimal part. Since then it was impossible that our life, which had been estranged from God, should of itself return to the high and heavenly place, for this cause, as saith the Apostle, He Who knew no sin is made sin for us[fn-20-P2099_1271124:13-nf] , and frees us from the curse by taking on Him our curse as His own[fn-21-P2100_1271215:14-nf] , and having taken up, and, in the language of the Apostle, \"slain\" in Himself \"the enmity[fn-21-P2101_1271328:15-nf] \" which by means of sin had come between us and God,-(in fact sin was \"the enmity\")-and having become what we were, He through Himself again united humanity to God. For having by purity brought into closest relationship with the Father of our nature that new man which is created after God[fn-21-P2102_1271640:16-nf] , in Whom dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead bodily[fn-21-P2103_1271716:17-nf] , He drew with Him into the same grace all the nature that partakes of His body and is akin to Him. And these glad tidings He proclaims through the woman, not to those disciples only, but also to all who up to the present day become disciples of the Word,-the tidings, namely, that man is no longer outlawed, nor cast out of the kingdom of God, but is once more a son, once more in the station assigned to him by his God, inasmuch as along with the first-fruits of humanity the lump also is hallowed[fn-21-P2104_1272237:18-nf] . \"For behold,\" He says, \"I and the children whom God hath given Me[fn-21-P2105_1272327:19-nf] .\" He Who for our sakes was partaker of flesh and blood has recovered you, and brought you back to the place whence ye strayed away, becoming mere flesh and blood by sin[fn-21-P2106_1272542:20-nf] . And so He from Whom we were formerly alienated by our revolt has become our Father and our God. Accordingly in the passage cited above the Lord brings the glad tidings of this benefit. And the words are not a proof of the degradation of the Son, but the glad tidings of our reconciliation to God. For that which has taken place in Christ's Humanity is a common boon bestowed on mankind generally. For as when we see in Him the weight of the body, which naturally gravitates to earth, ascending through the air into the heavens, we believe according to the words of the Apostle, that we also \"shall be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air[fn-21-P2107_1273219:21-nf] ,\" even so, when we hear that the true God and Father has become the God and Father of our First-fruits, we no longer doubt that the same God has become our God and Father too, inasmuch as we have learnt hat we shall come to the same place whither Christ has entered for us as our forerunner[fn-21-P2108_1273533:22-nf] . And the fact too that this grace was revealed by means of a woman, itself agrees with the interpretation which we have given For since, as the Apostle tells us, \"the woman, being deceived, was in the transgression[fn-21-P2109_1273771:23-nf] ,\" and was by her disobedience foremost in the revolt from God, for this cause she is the first witness of the resurrection, that she might retrieve by her faith in the resurrection the overthrow caused by her disobedience, and that as, by making herself at the beginning a minister and advocate to her husband of the counsels of the serpent, she brought into human life the beginning of evil, and its train of consequences, so, by ministering[fn-21-P2110_1274235:24-nf] to His disciples the words of Him Who slew the rebel dragon, she might become to men the guide to faith, whereby with good reason the first proclamation of death is annulled. It is likely, indeed, that by more diligent students a more profitable explanation of the text may be discovered. But even though none such should be found, I think that every devout reader will agree that the one advanced by our opponents is futile, after comparing it with that which we have brought forward. For the one has been fabricated to destroy the glory of the Only-begotten, and nothing more: but the other includes in its scope the aim of the dispensation concerning man. For it has been shown that it was not the intangible, immutable, and invisible God, but the moving, visible, and tangible nature which is proper to humanity, that gave command to Mary to minister the word to His disciples.","title":"Book XII","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":2,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_24_book_vi_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"56","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"After the decease of Julian, the government of the empire was, by the unanimous consent of the troops, tendered to Jovian.[fn-39-P3999_1760539:7-nf] When the army was about to proclaim him emperor, he announced himself to be a Christian and refused the sovereignty, nor would he receive the symbols of empire; but when the soldiers discovered the cause of his refusal, they loudly proclaimed that they were themselves Christians.","title":"Book VI.","author":"Hermias Sozomen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_24_book_vi_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"56","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"After the decease of Julian, the government of the empire was, by the unanimous consent of the troops, tendered to Jovian.[fn-39-P3999_1760539:7-nf] When the army was about to proclaim him emperor, he announced himself to be a Christian and refused the sovereignty, nor would he receive the symbols of empire; but when the soldiers discovered the cause of his refusal, they loudly proclaimed that they were themselves Christians.","title":"Book VI.","author":"Hermias Sozomen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_24_book_vi_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"56","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"After the decease of Julian, the government of the empire was, by the unanimous consent of the troops, tendered to Jovian.[fn-39-P3999_1760539:7-nf] When the army was about to proclaim him emperor, he announced himself to be a Christian and refused the sovereignty, nor would he receive the symbols of empire; but when the soldiers discovered the cause of his refusal, they loudly proclaimed that they were themselves Christians.","title":"Book VI.","author":"Hermias Sozomen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_24_book_vi_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"56","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"After the decease of Julian, the government of the empire was, by the unanimous consent of the troops, tendered to Jovian.[fn-39-P3999_1760539:7-nf] When the army was about to proclaim him emperor, he announced himself to be a Christian and refused the sovereignty, nor would he receive the symbols of empire; but when the soldiers discovered the cause of his refusal, they loudly proclaimed that they were themselves Christians.","title":"Book VI.","author":"Hermias Sozomen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_24_book_vi_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"56","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"After the decease of Julian, the government of the empire was, by the unanimous consent of the troops, tendered to Jovian.[fn-39-P3999_1760539:7-nf] When the army was about to proclaim him emperor, he announced himself to be a Christian and refused the sovereignty, nor would he receive the symbols of empire; but when the soldiers discovered the cause of his refusal, they loudly proclaimed that they were themselves Christians.","title":"Book VI.","author":"Hermias Sozomen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_24_book_vi_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"56","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"After the decease of Julian, the government of the empire was, by the unanimous consent of the troops, tendered to Jovian.[fn-39-P3999_1760539:7-nf] When the army was about to proclaim him emperor, he announced himself to be a Christian and refused the sovereignty, nor would he receive the symbols of empire; but when the soldiers discovered the cause of his refusal, they loudly proclaimed that they were themselves Christians.","title":"Book VI.","author":"Hermias Sozomen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_24_book_vi_","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"162","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"About this period Liberius died,[fn-41-P4166_1823627:48-nf] and Damasus succeeded to the see of Rome.[fn-41-P4167_1823694:49-nf] A deacon named Ursicius, who had obtained some votes in his favor, but could not endure the defeat, therefore caused himself to be clandestinely ordained by some bishops of little note, and endeavored to create a division among the people and to hold a separate church.

Vitalius, a presbyter of Antioch, and one of the priests of Meletius, concurred with him in the confirmation of his peculiar opinion. In other respects, Vitalius was conspicuous in life and conduct, and was zealous in watching over those committed to his pastoral superintendence; hence he was greatly revered by the people. He seceded from communion with Meletius, joined Apolinarius and presided over those at Antioch who had embraced the same opinions; by the sanctity of his life he attracted a great number of followers, who are still called Vitalians by the citizens of Antioch. It is said he was led to secede from the Church from resentment at the contempt that was manifested towards him by Flavian, then one of his fellow-presbyters, but who was afterwards raised to the bishopric of Antioch. Flavian having prevented him from holding his customary interview with the bishop, he fancied himself despised and entered into communion with Apolinarius, and held him as his friend. From that period the members of this sect have formed separate churches in various cities, under their own bishops, and have established laws differing from those of the Catholic Church. Besides the customary sacred order, they sang some metrical songs composed by Apolinarius; for, in addition to his other learning he was a poet, and skilled in a great variety of meters, and by their sweetness he induced many to cleave to him. Men sang his strains at convivial meetings and at their daily labor, and women sang them while engaged at the loom. But, whether his tender poems were adapted for holidays, festivals, or other occasions, they were all alike to the praise and glory of God. Damasus, bishop of Rome, and Peter, bishop of Alexandria, were the first to learn that the heresy was creeping among the people, and at a council held at Rome[fn-41-P4194_1836519:57-nf] they voted it to be foreign to the Catholic Church. It is said that it was as much from narrowness of mind as from any other cause that Apolinarius made an innovation in doctrine. For when Athanasius, who administered the church of Alexandria, was on his road back to Egypt from the place whither he had been banished by Constantine, he had to pass through Laodicea, and that while in that city he formed an intimacy with Apolinarius, which terminated in the strictest friendship. As, however, the heterodox considered it disgraceful to hold communion with Athanasius, George, the bishop of the Arians in that city, ejected Apolinarius in a very insulting manner from the church, under the plea that he had received Athanasius contrary to the canons and holy laws. The bishop did not rest here, but reproached him with crimes which he had committed and repented of at a remote period. For when Theodotus, the predecessor of George, regulated the church of Laodicea, Epiphanius, the sophist, recited a hymn which he had composed in honor of Dionysus. Apolinarius, who was then a youth and a pupil of Epiphanius, went to hear the recitation, accompanied by his father, whose name also was Apolinarius, and who was a noted grammarian. After the exordium, Epiphanius, according to the custom always observed at the public recitation of hymns, directed the uninitiated and the profane to go out of doors. But neither Apolinarius the younger nor the elder, nor, indeed, any of the Christians who were present, left the audience. When Theodotus, the bishop, heard that they had been present during the recitation, he was exceedingly displeased; he, however, pardoned the laymen who had committed this error, after they had received a moderate reproof. With respect to Apolinarius, father and son, he convicted them both publicly of their sin, and ejected them from the church; for they both belonged to the clergy, the father being a presbyter, and the son a reader of the Holy Scriptures. After some time had elapsed, and when the father and son had evinced by tears and fasting a degree of repentance adequate to their transgression, Theodotus restored them to their offices in the church. When George received the same bishopric, he excommunicated Apolinarius, and treated him as alien to the Church on account of his having, as before stated, received Athanasius into communion. It is said that Apolinarius besought him repeatedly to restore him to communion, but that he was inexorable. Apolinarius, overcome with grief, disturbed the Church, and by innovations in doctrines introduced the aforesaid heresy;[fn-41-P4195_1839256:58-nf] and he thought by means of his eloquence to revenge himself on his enemy by proving that George had deposed one who was more deeply acquainted with the Sacred Scriptures than himself. Thus do the private animosities of the clergy from time to time greatly injure the Church, and divide religion into many heresies. And this is a proof; for had George, like Theodotus, received Apolinarius on his repentance into communion, I believe that we should never have heard of the heresy that bears his name. Men are prone, when loaded with opprobrium and contempt, to resort to rivalries and innovations; whereas when treated with justice, they become moderate, and remain in the same position.","title":"Book VI.","author":"Hermias Sozomen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_24_book_vi_","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"179","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"About this period, Apolinarius openly devised a heresy, to which his name has since been given.[fn-41-P4193_1834490:56-nf] He induced many persons to secede from the Church, and formed separate assemblies. Vitalius, a presbyter of Antioch, and one of the priests of Meletius, concurred with him in the confirmation of his peculiar opinion. In other respects, Vitalius was conspicuous in life and conduct, and was zealous in watching over those committed to his pastoral superintendence; hence he was greatly revered by the people. He seceded from communion with Meletius, joined Apolinarius and presided over those at Antioch who had embraced the same opinions; by the sanctity of his life he attracted a great number of followers, who are still called Vitalians by the citizens of Antioch. It is said he was led to secede from the Church from resentment at the contempt that was manifested towards him by Flavian, then one of his fellow-presbyters, but who was afterwards raised to the bishopric of Antioch. Flavian having prevented him from holding his customary interview with the bishop, he fancied himself despised and entered into communion with Apolinarius, and held him as his friend. From that period the members of this sect have formed separate churches in various cities, under their own bishops, and have established laws differing from those of the Catholic Church. Besides the customary sacred order, they sang some metrical songs composed by Apolinarius; for, in addition to his other learning he was a poet, and skilled in a great variety of meters, and by their sweetness he induced many to cleave to him. Men sang his strains at convivial meetings and at their daily labor, and women sang them while engaged at the loom. But, whether his tender poems were adapted for holidays, festivals, or other occasions, they were all alike to the praise and glory of God. Damasus, bishop of Rome, and Peter, bishop of Alexandria, were the first to learn that the heresy was creeping among the people, and at a council held at Rome[fn-41-P4194_1836519:57-nf] they voted it to be foreign to the Catholic Church. It is said that it was as much from narrowness of mind as from any other cause that Apolinarius made an innovation in doctrine. For when Athanasius, who administered the church of Alexandria, was on his road back to Egypt from the place whither he had been banished by Constantine, he had to pass through Laodicea, and that while in that city he formed an intimacy with Apolinarius, which terminated in the strictest friendship. As, however, the heterodox considered it disgraceful to hold communion with Athanasius, George, the bishop of the Arians in that city, ejected Apolinarius in a very insulting manner from the church, under the plea that he had received Athanasius contrary to the canons and holy laws. The bishop did not rest here, but reproached him with crimes which he had committed and repented of at a remote period. For when Theodotus, the predecessor of George, regulated the church of Laodicea, Epiphanius, the sophist, recited a hymn which he had composed in honor of Dionysus. Apolinarius, who was then a youth and a pupil of Epiphanius, went to hear the recitation, accompanied by his father, whose name also was Apolinarius, and who was a noted grammarian. After the exordium, Epiphanius, according to the custom always observed at the public recitation of hymns, directed the uninitiated and the profane to go out of doors. But neither Apolinarius the younger nor the elder, nor, indeed, any of the Christians who were present, left the audience. When Theodotus, the bishop, heard that they had been present during the recitation, he was exceedingly displeased; he, however, pardoned the laymen who had committed this error, after they had received a moderate reproof. With respect to Apolinarius, father and son, he convicted them both publicly of their sin, and ejected them from the church; for they both belonged to the clergy, the father being a presbyter, and the son a reader of the Holy Scriptures. After some time had elapsed, and when the father and son had evinced by tears and fasting a degree of repentance adequate to their transgression, Theodotus restored them to their offices in the church.

The question now before us does not concern the nature of human seed, but its corruption. Now the nature has God for its author; it is from its corruption that original sin is derived. If, indeed, the seed had itself no corruption, what means that passage in the Book of Wisdom, \"Not being ignorant that they were a naughty generation, and that their malice was inbred, and that their cogitation would never be changed; for their seed was accursed from the beginning\"?[fn-41-P4195_1583728:46-nf] Now whatever may be the particular application of these words, they are spoken of mankind. How, then, is the malice of every man inbred, and his seed cursed from the beginning, unless it be in respect of the fact, that \"by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for in him all have sinned\"?[fn-41-P4196_1584092:47-nf] But where is the man whose \"evil cogitation can never be changed,\" unless because it cannot be effected by himself, but only by divine grace; without the assistance of which, what are human beings, but that which the Apostle Peter says of them, when he describes them as \"natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed\"?[fn-41-P4197_1584435:48-nf] Accordingly, the Apostle Paul, in a certain passage, having both conditions in view,-even the wrath of God with which we are born, and the grace wherebywe are delivered,-says: \"Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. But God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ; by whose grace we are saved.\"[fn-41-P4198_1585003:49-nf] What, then, is man's \"natural malice,\" and \"the seed cursed from the beginning;\" and what are \"the natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed,\" and what the \"by nature children of wrath\"? Was this the condition of the nature which was formed in Adam? God forbid! Inasmuch as his pure nature, however, was corrupted in him, it has run on in this condition by natural descent through all, and still is running; so that there is no deliverance for it from this ruin, except by the grace of God through our Lord Jesus Christ.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":20,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_32_similitude_ninth","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"66","folder":"ANF-02","text":"\"Explain to me, sir,\" I said, \"the names of these virgins, and of those women who were clothed in black raiment.\" \"Hear,\" he said, \"the names of the stronger virgins who stood at the comers.

She was incensed against Ambrose because he strenuously opposed her attempts at innovation, and she represented to her son that he had insulted her. Valentinian believed this calumny, and, determined to avenge the supposed wrongs of his mother, he sent a party of soldiers against the church. On their reaching the temple, they forced their way into the interior, arrested Ambrose, and were about to lead him into exile at that very moment, when the people assembled in crowds at the church, and evinced a resolution to die rather than submit to the banishment of their priest. Justina was still further incensed at this occurrence; and with a view of enforcing her project by law, she sent for Menivolus,[fn-43-P4380_1949786:26-nf] one of the legal secretaries, and commanded him to draw up, as quickly as possible, an edict confirmatory of the decrees of Ariminum. Menivolus, being firmly attached to the Catholic Church, refused to write the document, and the empress tried to bribe him by promises of greater honors. He still, however, refused compliance, and, tearing off his belt, he threw it at the feet of Justina, and declared that he would neither retain his present office, nor accept of promotion, as the reward of impiety. As he remained firm in his refusal, others were intrusted with the compilation of the law. By this law, all who conformed to the doctrines set forth at Ariminum and ratified at Constantinople were exhorted to convene boldly; and it was enacted that death should be the punishment of those who should hinder or be running counter to this law of the emperor.","title":"Book VII.","author":"Hermias Sozomen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_25_book_vii_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"70","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"While Theodosius was making preparations for a war against Maximus, his son Honorius was born.[fn-43-P4386_1952610:27-nf] On the completion of these warlike preparations, he left his son Arcadius to govern at Constantinople, and proceeded to Thessalonica, where he received Valentinian.

He left a son named Auxentius, who was noted for his very faithful piety, his zeal for his friends, the moderation of his life, his love of letters, and the greatness of his attainments in pagan and ecclesiastical literature. He was modest and retiring in deportment, although admitted to familiarity with the emperor and the courtiers, and possessed of a very illustrious appointment. His memory is still revered by the monks and zealous men, who were all acquainted with him. The woman who had been entrusted with the relic remained during the rest of her life at Cosilaos. She was greatly distinguished by her piety and wisdom, and instructed many holy virgins; and I have been assured that many still survive who reflect the honorable character which was the result of training under Matrona.","title":"Book VII.","author":"Hermias Sozomen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":31,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_25_book_vii_","source_chapter":23,"source_paragraph":"97","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"While Theodosius was thus occupied in the wise and peaceful government of his subjects in the East, and in the service of God, intelligence was brought that Valentinian had been strangled.[fn-44-P4442_1992605:48-nf] Some say that he was put to death by the eunuchs of the bedchamber, at the solicitation of Arbogastes, a military chief, and of certain courtiers, who were displeased because the young prince had begun to walk in the footsteps of his father, concerning the government, and contrary to the opinions approved by them.

The occasion of the sin was as follows. When Buthericus was general of the troops in Illyria, a charioteer saw him shamefully exposed at a tavern, and attempted an outrage; he was apprehended and put in custody. Some time after, some magnificent races were to be held at the hippodrome, and the populace of Thessalonica demanded the release of the prisoner, considering him necessary to the celebration of the contest. As their request was not attended to, they rose up in sedition and finally slew Buthericus. On hearing of this deed, the wrath of the emperor was excited immediately, and he commanded that a certain number of the citizens should be put to death. The city was filled with the blood of many unjustly shed; for strangers, who had but just arrived there on their journey to other lands, were sacrificed with the others. There were many cases of suffering well worthy of commiseration, of which the following is an instance. A merchant offered himself to be slain as a substitute for his two sons who had both been selected as victims, and promised the soldiers to give them all the gold he possessed, on condition of their effecting the exchange. They could not but compassionate his misfortune, and consented to take him as a substitute for one of his sons, but declared that they did not dare to let off both the young men, as that would render the appointed number of the slain incomplete. The father gazed on his sons, groaning and weeping; he could not save either from death, but he continued hesitating until they had been put to death, being overcome by an equal love for each. I have also been informed, that a faithful slave voluntarily offered to die instead of his master, who was being led to the place of execution.

But as we have already, in a way proportionate to the brevity of our discourse, spoken of the objects of the promise, and of its own stability; let us now look at this one point, as far as we are able, what it is that He was pleased to promise when He said, \"I will that they also whom Thou hast given me be with me where I am.\" As far as pertains to the creaturehood wherein He was made of the seed of David according to the flesh,[fn-35-P3572_1982634:6-nf] not even He Himself was yet where He would afterwards be: but He could say in this way, \"where I am,\" to let us understand that He was soon to ascend into heaven, so that He spake of Himself as being already there, where He was presently to be. He could do so also in the same way as He had said on a former occasion, when speaking to Nicodemus, \"No man ascendeth into heaven, save He that came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven.\"[fn-35-P3573_1983100:7-nf] For there also He did not say, Will be, but \"is,\" because of the oneness of person, wherein God is at once man, and man God. He promised, therefore, that we should be in heaven; for thither the servant-form, which He received of the Virgin, has been elevated, and set at the right hand of the Father. Because of the same blessed hope the apostle also says: \"But God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ; by whose grace we are saved; and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.\"[fn-35-P3574_1983744:8-nf] And so accordingly we may understand the Lord to have said, \"That where I am, there they may be also.\" He, indeed, said of Himself that He was there already; but of us He merely declared that He wished us to be there with Him, without any indication that we were there already But what the Lord said that He wished to be done, the apostle spake of as already accomplished. For he said not, He will yet raise us up, and make us sit in heavenly places; but, \"hath raised us up, and made us sit in heavenly places:\" for it is not without good grounds, but in believing assurance, that he reckons as already done what he is certain will yet be done. But if it is in respect of the form of God, wherein He is equal to the Father, that we would be inclined to understand His words, \"I will that they also be with me, where I am,\" let our mind get quit of every thought of material images: whateverthe soul has had presented to it, that is endowed with length, or breadth, or thickness, tinted by the light with any sort of bodily hue, or diffused through local space of any kind, whether finite or infinite, let it, as far as possible, turn away from all such notions the glance of its contemplation on the inward bent of its thoughts. And let us not be making inquiries as to where the Son, the Father's co-equal, is, since no one has yet found out where He is not. But if any one would inquire, let him inquire rather how he may be with Him; not everywhere as He is, but wherever He may be. For when He said to the man that was expiating his crimes on the tree, and making confession unto salvation, \"Today shall thou be with me in paradise,\"[fn-35-P3575_1985400:9-nf] in respect to His human nature His own soul was on that very day to be in hell,[fn-35-P3576_1985500:10-nf] His flesh in the sepulchre; but as respected His Godhead He was certainly also in paradise. And therefore the soul of the thief, absolved from his by-gone crimes, and already in the blessed enjoyment of His grace, although it could not be everywhere as He was, yet could on that very day be also with Him in paradise, from which He, who is always everywhere, had not withdrawn. On this account, doubtless, it was not enough for Him to say, \"I will that they also be where I am;\" but He added, \"with me.\" For to be with Him is the chief good. For even the miserable can be where He is, since wheresoever any are, there is He also; but the blessed only are with Him, because it is only of Him that they can be blessed. Was it not truly said to God, \"If I ascend into heaven, Thou art there; and if I go down into hell, Thou art present?\"[fn-35-P3577_1986354:11-nf] or is not Christ after all that Wisdom of God which \"penetrateth everywhere because of its purity\"?[fn-35-P3578_1986474:12-nf] But the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not.[fn-35-P3579_1986567:13-nf] And similarly, to take a kind of illustration from what is visible, although greatly unlike, as the blind man, even though he be where the light is, is yet not himself with the light, but is really absent from that which is present; so the unbeliever and profane, or even the believer and pious, because not yet competent to gaze on the light of wisdom, although he cannot be anywhere that Christ is not there likewise, yet is not himself with Christ, I mean in actual sight. For we cannot doubt that the true believer is with Christ by faith; because in reference to this He saith, \"He that is not with me is against me.\"[fn-35-P3580_1987207:14-nf] But when He said to God the Father, \"I will that they also whom Thou hast given me be with me where I am,\" He spake exclusively of that sight wherein we shall see Him as He is.[fn-35-P3581_1987404:15-nf] ","title":"Tractate CXI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_23_book_i_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"70","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"36.

Again, as to Mark's mentioning that the Lord said not only \"Father,\" but \"Abba, Father,\" the explanation simply is, that \"Abba\" is in Hebrew exactly what \"Pater\" is in Latin. And perhaps the Lord may have used both words with some kind of symbolical significance, intending to indicate thereby, that in sustaining this sorrow He bore the part of His body, which is the Church, of which He has been made the corner-stone, and which comes to Him [in the person of disciples gathered] partly out of the Hebrews, to whom He refers when He says \"Abba,\" and partly out of the Gentiles, to whom He refers when He says \"Pater\" [Father].[fn-23-P2305_983569:45-nf] The Apostle Paul also makes use of the same significant expression. For he says, \"In whom we cry, Abba, Father;\"[fn-23-P2306_983707:46-nf] and, in another passage, \"God sent His Spirit into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.\"[fn-23-P2307_983814:47-nf] For it was meet that the good Master and true Saviour, by sharing in the sufferings of the more infirm,[fn-23-P2308_983935:48-nf] should in His own person illustrate the truth that His witnesses ought not to despair, although it might perchance happen that, through human frailty, sorrow might steal in upon their hearts at the time of suffering; seeing that they would overcome it if, mindful that God knows what is best for those whose well-being He regards, they gave His will the preference over their own. On this subject, however, as a whole, the present is not the time for entering on any more detailed discussion. For we have to deal simply with the question concerning the harmony of the evangelists, from whose varied modes of narration we gather the wholesome lesson that, in order to get at the truth, the one essential thing to aim at in dealing with the terms is simply the intention which the speaker had in view in using them. For the word \"Father\" means just the same as the phrase \"Abba, Father.\" But with a view to bring out the mystic significance, the expression, \"Abba, Father,\" is the clearer form; while, for indicating the unity, the word \"Father\" is sufficient. And that the Lord did indeed employ this method of address, \"Abba, Father,\" must be accepted as matter of fact. But still His intention would not appear very obvious were there not the means (since others use simply the term \"Father\") to show that under such a form of expression those two Churches, which are constituted, the one out of the Jews, and the other out of the Gentiles, are presented as also really one. In this way, then, [we may suppose that] the phrase, \"Abba, Father,\" was adopted in order to convey the same idea as was indicated by the Lord on another occasion, when He said, \"Other sheep I have which are not of this fold.\"[fn-23-P2309_985712:49-nf] In these words He certainly referred to the Gentiles, since He had sheep also among the people of Israel. But in that passage He goes on immediately to add the declaration, \"Them also I must bring, that there may be one fold and one Shepherd.\" And so we may say that, just as the phrase, \"Abba, Father,\" contains the idea of [the two races,] the Israelites and the Gentiles, the word \"Father,\" used alone, points to the one flock which these two constitute.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_114_letter_lx_to_adelphius_bishop_and_confessor_against_the_arians_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"7. But we should like your piety to ask them this. When Israel was ordered to go up to Jerusalem to worship at the temple of the Lord, where was the ark, `and above it the Cherubim of glory overshadowing the Mercy-seat[fn-101-P10115_3622345:30-nf] ,' did they do well or the opposite? If they did ill, how came it that they who despised this law were liable to punishment? for it is written that if a man make light of it and go not up, he shall perish from among the people[fn-101-P10116_3622589:31-nf] . But if they did well, and in this proved well-pleasing to God, are not the Arians, abominable and most shameful of any heresy, many times worthy of destruction, in that while they approve the former People for the honour paid by them to the Temple, they will not worship the Lord Who is in the flesh as in a temple? And yet the former temple was constructed of stones and gold, as a shadow. But when the reality came, the type ceased from thenceforth, and there did not remain, according to the Lord's utterance, one stone upon another that was not broken down[fn-101-P10117_3623188:32-nf] . And they did not, when they saw the temple of stones, suppose that the Lord who spoke in the temple was a creature; nor did they set the Temple at nought and retire far off to worship. But they came to it according to the Law, and worshipped the God who uttered His oracles from the Temple. Since then this was so, how can it be other than right to worship the Body of the Lord, all-holy and all-reverend as it is, announced as it was by the archangel Gabriel, formed by the Holy Spirit, and made the Vesture of the Word? It was at any rate a bodily hand that the Word stretched out to raise her that was sick of a fever[fn-101-P10118_3623831:33-nf] : a human voice that He uttered to raise Lazarus from the dead[fn-101-P10119_3623911:34-nf] ; and, once again, stretching out His hands upon the Cross, He overthrew the prince of the power of the air, that now works[fn-101-P10120_3624053:35-nf] in the sons of disobedience, and made the way clear for us into the heavens.","title":"Letter LX.

To none other than Him is it suitable, who is also \"the Father of mercies,\"[fn-76-P7669_2195768:492-nf] and (in the prophets) has been described as \"full of compassion, and gracious, and plenteous in mercy.\"[fn-76-P7670_2195892:493-nf] In Jonah you find the signal act of His mercy, which He showed to the praying Ninevites.[fn-76-P7671_2196035:494-nf] How inflexible was He at the tears of Hezekiah![fn-76-P7672_2196104:495-nf] How ready to forgive Ahab, the husband of Jezebel, the blood of Naboth, when he deprecated His anger.[fn-76-P7673_2196231:496-nf] How prompt in pardoning David on his confession of his sin[fn-76-P7674_2196318:497-nf] -preferring, indeed, the sinner's repentance to his death, of course because of His gracious attribute of mercy.[fn-76-P7675_2196454:498-nf] Now, if Marcion's god has exhibited or proclaimed any such thing as this, I will allow him to be \"the Father of mercies.\" Since, however, he ascribes to him this title only from the time he has been revealed, as if he were the father of mercies from the time only when he began to liberate the human race, then we on our side, too,[fn-76-P7676_2196811:499-nf] adopt the same precise date of his alleged revelation; but it is that we may deny him! It is then not competent to him to ascribe any quality to his god, whom indeed he only promulged by the fact of such an ascription; for only if it were previously evident that his god had an existence, could he be permitted to ascribe an attribute to him. The ascribed attribute is only an accident; but accidents[fn-76-P7677_2197234:500-nf] are preceded by the statement of the thing itself of which they are predicated, especially when another claims the attribute which is ascribed to him who has not been previously shown to exist. Our denial of his existence will be all the more peremptory, because of the fact that the attribute which is alleged in proof of it belongs to that God who has been already revealed. Therefore \"the New Testament\" will appertain to none other than Him who promised it-if not \"its letter, yet its spirit; \"[fn-76-P7678_2197775:501-nf] and herein will lie its newness. Indeed, He who had engraved its letter in stones is the same as He who had said of its spirit, \"I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh.\"[fn-76-P7679_2197972:502-nf] Even if \"the letter killeth, yet the Spirit giveth life; \"[fn-76-P7680_2198051:503-nf] and both belong to Him who says: \"I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal.\"[fn-76-P7681_2198156:504-nf] We have already made good the Creator's claim to this twofold character of judgment and goodness[fn-76-P7682_2198277:505-nf] -\"killing in the letter\" through the law, and \"quickening in the Spirit\" through the Gospel. Now these attributes, however different they be, cannot possibly make two gods; for they have already (in the prevenient dispensation of the Old Testament) been found to meet in One.[fn-76-P7683_2198601:506-nf] He alludes to Moses' veil, covered with which \"his face could not be stedfastly seen by the children of Israel.\"[fn-76-P7684_2198755:507-nf] Since he did this to maintain the superiority of the glory of the New Testament, which is permanent in its glory, over that of the Old, \"which was to be done away,\"[fn-76-P7685_2198946:508-nf] this fact gives support to my belief which exalts the Gospel above the law and you must look well to it that it does not even more than this. For only there is superiority possible where was previously the thing over which superiority can be affirmed. But then he says, \"But their minds were blinded\"[fn-76-P7686_2199272:509-nf] -of the world; certainly not the Creator's mind, but the minds of the people which are in the world.[fn-76-P7687_2199416:510-nf] Of Israel he says, Even unto this day the same veil is upon their heart; \"[fn-76-P7688_2199659:511-nf] showing that the veil which was on the face of Moses was a figure of the veil which is on the heart of the nation still; because even now Moses is not seen by them in heart, just as he was not then seen by them in eye. But what concern has Paul with the veil which still obscures Moses from their view, if the Christ of the Creator, whom Moses predicted, is not yet come? How are the hearts of the Jews represented as still covered and veiled, if the predictions of Moses relating to Christ, in whom it was their duty to believe through him, are as yet unfulfilled? What had the apostle of a strange Christ to complain of, if the Jews failed in understanding the mysterious announcements of their own God, unless the veil which was upon their hearts had reference to that blindness which concealed from their eyes the Christ of Moses? Then, again, the words which follow, But when it shall turn to the Lord, the evil shall be taken away,\"[fn-76-P7689_2200621:512-nf] properly refer to the Jew, over whose gaze Moses' veil is spread, to the effect that, when he is turned to the faith of Christ, he will understand how Moses spoke of Christ. But how shall the veil of the Creator be taken away by the Christ of another god, whose mysteries the Creator could not possibly have veiled-unknown mysteries, as they were of an unknown god? So he says that \"we now with open face\" (meaning the candour of the heart, which in the Jews had been covered with a veil), \"beholding Christ, are changed into the same image, from that glory\" (wherewith Moses was transfigured as by the glory of the Lord) \"to another glory.\"[fn-76-P7690_2201286:513-nf] By thus setting forth the glory which illumined the person of Moses from his interview with God, and the veil which concealed the same from the infirmity of the people, and by superinducing thereupon the revelation and the glory of the Spirit in the person of Christ-\"even as,\" to use his words, \"by the Spirit of the Lord\"[fn-76-P7691_2201633:514-nf] -he testifies that the whole Mosaic system[fn-76-P7692_2201897:515-nf] was a figure of Christ, of whom the Jews indeed were ignorant, but who is known to us Christians. We are quite aware that some passages are open to ambiguity, from the way in which they are read, or else from their punctuation, when there is room for these two causes of ambiguity. The latter method has been adopted by Marcion, by reading the passage which follows, \"in whom the God of this world,\"[fn-76-P7693_2202325:516-nf] as if it described the Creator as the God of this world, in order that he may, by these words, imply that there is another God for the other world. We, however, say that the passage ought to be punctuated with a comma after God, to this effect: \"In whom God hath blinded the eyes of the unbelievers of this world.\"[fn-76-P7694_2202661:517-nf] \"In whom\" means the Jewish unbelievers, from some of whom the gospel is still hidden under Moses' veil. Now it is these whom God had threatened for \"loving Him indeed with the lip, whilst their heart was far from Him,\"[fn-76-P7695_2203650:518-nf] in these angry words: \"Ye shall hear with your ears, and not understand; and see with your eyes, but not perceive; \"[fn-76-P7696_2203789:519-nf] and, \"If ye will not believe, ye shall not understand; \"[fn-76-P7697_2203881:520-nf] and again, \"I will take away the wisdom of their wise men, and bring to nought[fn-76-P7698_2203987:521-nf] the understanding of their prudent ones.\" But these words, of course, He did not pronounce against them for concealing the gospel of the unknown God. At any rate, if there is a God of this world,[fn-76-P7699_2204217:522-nf] He blinds the heart of the unbelievers of this world, because they have not of their own accord recognised His Christ, who ought to be understood from His Scriptures.[fn-77-P7700_2204457:523-nf] Content with my advantage, I can willingly refrain from noticing to any greater length[fn-77-P7701_2204617:524-nf] this point of ambiguous punctuation, so as not to give my adversary any advantage,[fn-77-P7702_2204753:525-nf] indeed, I might have wholly omitted the discussion. A simpler answer I shall find ready to hand in interpreting \"the god of this world\" of the devil, who once said, as the prophet describes him: \"I will be like the Most High; I will exalt my throne in the clouds.\"[fn-77-P7703_2205190:526-nf] The whole superstition, indeed, of this world has got into his hands,[fn-77-P7704_2205281:527-nf] so that he blinds effectually the hearts of unbelievers, and of none more than the apostate Marcion's. Now he did not observe how much this clause of the sentence made against him: \"For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to (give) the light of the knowledge (of His glory) in the face of (Jesus) Christ.\"[fn-77-P7705_2205660:528-nf] Now who was it that said; \"Let there be light? \"[fn-77-P7706_2205730:529-nf] And who was it that said to Christ concerning giving light to the world: \"I have set Thee as a light to the Gentiles\"[fn-77-P7707_2205866:530-nf] -to them, that is, \"who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death? \"[fn-77-P7708_2205989:531-nf] (None else, surely, than He), to whom the Spirit in the Psalm answers, in His foresight of the future, saying, \"The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, hath been displayed upon us.\"[fn-77-P7709_2206205:532-nf] Now the countenance (or person[fn-77-P7710_2206262:533-nf] ) of the Lord here is Christ. Wherefore the apostle said above: Christ, who is the image of God.\"[fn-77-P7711_2206409:534-nf] Since Christ, then, is the person of the Creator, who said, \"Let there be light,\" it follows that Christ and the apostles, and the gospel, and the veil, and Moses-nay, the whole of the dispensations-belong to the God who is the Creator of this world, according to the testimony of the clause (above adverted to), and certainly not to him who never said, \"Let there be light.\" I here pass over discussion about another epistle, which we hold to have been written to the Ephesians, but the heretics to the Laodiceans. In it he tells[fn-77-P7712_2206961:535-nf] them to remember, that at the time when they were Gentiles they were without Christ, aliens from (the commonwealth of) Israel, without intercourse, without the covenants and any hope of promise, nay, without God, even in his own world,[fn-77-P7713_2207209:536-nf] as the Creator thereof. Since therefore he said, that the Gentiles were without God, whilst their god was the devil, not the Creator, it is clear that he must be understood to be the lord of this world, whom the Gentiles received as their god-not the Creator, of whom they were in ignorance. But how does it happen, that \"the treasure which we have in these earthen vessels of ours\"[fn-77-P7714_2207612:537-nf] should not be regarded as belonging to the God who owns the vessels? Now since God's glory is, that so great a treasure is contained in earthen vessels, and since these earthen vessels are of the Creator's make, it follows that the glory is the Creator's; nay, since these vessels of His smack so much of the excellency of the power of God, that power itself must be His also! Indeed, all these things have been consigned to the said \"earthen vessels\" for the very purpose that His excellence might be manifested forth. Henceforth, then, the rival god will have no claim to the glory, and consequently none to the power. Rather, dishonour and weakness will accrue to him, because the earthen vessels with which he had nothing to do have received all the excellency! Well, then, if it be in these very earthen vessels that he tells us we have to endure so great sufferings,[fn-77-P7715_2208506:538-nf] in which we bear about with us the very dying of God,[fn-77-P7716_2208584:539-nf] (Marcion's) god is really ungrateful and unjust, if he does not mean to restore this same I substance of ours at the resurrection, wherein so much has been endured in loyalty to him, in which Christ's very death is borne about, wherein too the excellency of his power is treasured.[fn-77-P7717_2209030:540-nf] For he gives prominence to the statement, \"That the life also of Christ may be manifested in our body,\"[fn-77-P7718_2209156:541-nf] as a contrast to the preceding, that His death is borne about in our body. Now of what life of Christ does he here speak? Of that which we are now living? Then how is it, that in the words which follow he exhorts us not to the things which are seen and are temporal, but to those which are not seen and are eternal[fn-77-P7719_2209494:542-nf] -in other words, not to the present, but to the future? But if it be of the future life of Christ that he speaks, intimating that it is to be made manifest in our body,[fn-77-P7720_2209688:543-nf] then he has clearly predicted the resurrection of the flesh.[fn-77-P7721_2209771:544-nf] He says, too, that \"our outward man perishes,\"[fn-77-P7722_2209840:545-nf] not meaning by an eternal perdition after death, but by labours and sufferings, in reference to which he previously said, \"For which cause we will not faint.\"[fn-77-P7723_2210021:546-nf] Now, when he adds of \"the inward man\" also, that it \"is renewed day by day,\" he demonstrates both issues here-the wasting away of the body by the wear and tear[fn-77-P7724_2210203:547-nf] of its trials, and the renewal of the soul[fn-77-P7725_2210264:548-nf] by its contemplation of the promises.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"62","folder":"ANF-03","text":"We have it on the true tradition[fn-79-P7952_2264515:757-nf] of the Church, that this epistle was sent to the Ephesians, not to the Laodiceans. Marcion, however, was very desirous of giving it the new rifle (of Laodicean),[fn-79-P7953_2264695:758-nf] as if he were extremely accurate in investigating such a point. But of what consequence are the titles, since in writing to a certain church the apostle did in fact write to all? It is certain that, whoever they were to whom he wrote,[fn-79-P7954_2264997:759-nf] he declared Him to be God in Christ with whom all things agree which are predicted. Now, to what god will most suitably belong all those things which relate to \"that good pleasure, which God hath purposed in the mystery of His will, that in the dispensation of the fulness of times He might recapitulate\" (if I may so say, according to the exact meaning of the Greek word[fn-79-P7955_2265389:760-nf] ) \"all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth,\"[fn-79-P7956_2265517:761-nf] but to Him whose are all things from their beginning, yea the beginning itself too; from whom issue the times and the dispensation of the fulness of times, according to which all things up to the very first are gathered up in Christ? What beginning, however, has the other god; that is to say, how can anything proceed from him, who has no work to show? And if there be no beginning, how can there be times? If no times, what fulness of times can there be? And if no fulness, what dispensation? Indeed, what has he ever done on earth, that any long dispensation of times to be fulfilled can be put to his account, for the accomplishment of all things in Christ, even of things in heaven? Nor can we possibly suppose that any things whatever have been at any time done in heaven by any other God than Him by whom, as all men allow, all things have been done on earth. Now, if it is impossible for all these things from the beginning to be reckoned to any other God than the Creator, who will believe that an alien god has recapitulated them in an alien Christ, instead of their own proper Author in His own Christ? If, again, they belong to the Creator, they must needs be separate from the other god; and if separate, then opposed to him. But then how can opposites be gathered together into him by whom they are in short destroyed? Again, what Christ do the following words announce, when the apostle says: \"That we should be to the praise of His glory, who first trusted in Christ? \"[fn-79-P7957_2267025:762-nf] Now who could have first trusted-i.e. previously trusted[fn-79-P7958_2267101:763-nf] -in God, before His advent, except the Jews to whom Christ was previously announced, from the beginning? He who was thus foretold, was also foretrusted. Hence the apostle refers the statement to himself, that is, to the Jews, in order that he may draw a distinction with respect to the Gentiles, (when he goes on to say: ) \"In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel (of your salvation); in whom ye believed, and were sealed with His Holy Spirit of promise.\"[fn-79-P7959_2267644:764-nf] Of what promise? That which was made through Joel: \"In the last days will I pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh,\"[fn-79-P7960_2267778:765-nf] that is, on all nations. Therefore the Spirit and the Gospel will be found in the Christ, who was foretrusted, because foretold. Again, \"the Father of glory\"[fn-79-P7961_2267956:766-nf] is He whose Christ, when ascending to heaven, is celebrated as \"the King of Glory\" in the Psalm: \"Who is this King of Glory? the Lord of Hosts, He is the King of Glory.\"[fn-79-P7962_2268146:767-nf] From Him also is besought \"the spirit of wisdom,\"[fn-79-P7963_2268217:768-nf] at whose disposal is enumerated that sevenfold distribution of the spirit of grace by Isaiah.[fn-79-P7964_2268330:769-nf] He likewise will grant \"the enlightenment of the eyes of the understanding,\"[fn-79-P7965_2268426:770-nf] who has also enriched our natural eyes with light; to whom, moreover, the blindness of the people is offensive: \"And who is blind, but my servants? ... yea, the servants of God have become blind.\"[fn-79-P7966_2268640:771-nf] In His gift, too, are \"the riches (of the glory) of His inheritance in the saints,\"[fn-79-P7967_2268754:772-nf] who promised such an inheritance in the call of the Gentiles: \"Ask of me, and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance.\"[fn-79-P7968_2268904:773-nf] It was He who \"wrought in Christ His mighty power, by raising Him from the dead, and setting Him at His own right hand, and putting all things under His feet\"[fn-79-P7969_2269081:774-nf] -even the same who said: \"Sit Thou on my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\"[fn-79-P7970_2269199:775-nf] For in another passage the Spirit says to the Father concerning the Son: \"Thou hast put all things under His feet.\"[fn-79-P7971_2269333:776-nf] Now, if from all these facts which are found in the Creator there is yet to be deduced[fn-79-P7972_2269440:777-nf] another god and another Christ, let us go in quest of the Creator. I suppose, forsooth,[fn-79-P7973_2269545:778-nf] we find Him, when he speaks of such as \"were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein they had walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, who worketh in the children of disobedience.\"[fn-79-P7974_2269792:779-nf] But Marcion must not here interpret the world as meaning the God of the world.[fn-79-P7975_2269893:780-nf] For a creature bears no resemblance to the Creator; the thing made, none to its Maker; the world, none to God. He, moreover, who is the Prince of the power of the ages must not be thought to be called the prince of the power of the air; for He who is chief over the higher powers derives no title from the lower powers, although these, too, may be ascribed to Him. Nor, again, can He possibly seem to be the instigator[fn-79-P7976_2270363:781-nf] of that unbelief which He Himself had rather to endure at the hand of the Jews and the Gentiles alike. We may therefore simply conclude that[fn-79-P7977_2270587:782-nf] these designations are unsuited to the Creator. There is another being to whom they are more applicable-and the apostle knew very well who that was. Who then is he? Undoubtedly he who has raised up \"children of disobedience\" against the Creator Himself ever since he took possession of that \"air\" of His; even as the prophet makes him say: \"I will set my throne above the stars; ... I will go up above the clouds; I will be like the Most High.\"[fn-79-P7978_2271057:783-nf] This must mean the devil, whom in another passage (since such will they there have the apostle's meaning to be) we shall recognize in the appellation the god of this world.[fn-79-P7979_2271297:784-nf] For he has filled the whole world with the lying pretence of his own divinity. To be sure,[fn-79-P7980_2271481:785-nf] if he had not existed, we might then possibly have applied these descriptions to the Creator. But the apostle, too, had lived in Judaism; and when he parenthetically observed of the sins (of that period of his life), \"in which also we all had our conversation in times past,\"[fn-79-P7981_2271798:786-nf] he must not be understood to indicate that the Creator was the lord of sinful men, and the prince of this air; but as meaning that in his Judaism he had been one of the children of disobedience, having the devil as his instigator-when he persecuted the church and the Christ of the Creator. Therefore he says: \"We also were the children of wrath,\" but \"by nature.\"[fn-79-P7982_2272182:787-nf] Let the heretic, however, not contend that, because the Creator called the Jews children, therefore the Creator is the lord of wrath.[fn-79-P7983_2272335:788-nf] For when (the apostle) says,\" We were by nature the children of wrath,\" inasmuch as the Jews were not the Creator's children by nature, but by the election of their fathers, he (must have) referred their being children of wrath to nature, and not to the Creator, adding this at lasts\" even as others,\"[fn-79-P7984_2272664:789-nf] who, of course, were not children of God. It is manifest that sins, and lusts of the flesh, and unbelief, and anger, are ascribed to the common nature of all mankind, the devil [however leading that nature astray,[fn-79-P7985_2272897:790-nf] which he has already infected with the implanted germ of sin. \"We,\" says he, \"are His workmanship, created in Christ.\"[fn-79-P7986_2273033:791-nf] It is one thing to make (as a workman), another thing to create. But he assigns both to One. Man is the workmanship of the Creator. He therefore who made man (at first), created him also in Christ. As touching the substance of nature, He \"made\" him; as touching the work of grace, He \"created\" him. Look also at what follows in connection with these words: \"Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which has the name of circumcision in the flesh made by the hand-that at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise,[fn-79-P7987_2273717:792-nf] having no hope, and without God in the world.\"[fn-79-P7988_2273817:793-nf] Now, without what God and without what Christ were these Gentiles? Surely, without Him to whom the commonwealth[fn-79-P7989_2273953:794-nf] of Israel belonged, and the covenants and the promise. \"But now in Christ,\" says he, \"ye who were sometimes far off are made nigh by His blood.\"[fn-79-P7990_2274153:795-nf] From whom were they far off before? From the privileges) whereof he speaks above, even tom the Christ of the Creator, from the commonwealth of Israel, from the covenants, from the hope of the promise, from God Himself. Since this is the case, the Gentiles are consequently now in Christ made nigh to these (blessings), from which they were once far off. But if we are in Christ brought so very nigh to the commonwealth of Israel, which comprises the religion of the divine Creator, and to the covenants and to the promise, yea to their very God Himself, it is quite ridiculous (to suppose that) the Christ of the other god has brought us to this proximity to the Creator from afar. The apostle had in mind that it had been predicted concerning the call of the Gentiles from their distant alienation in words like these: \"They who were far off from me have come to my righteousness.\"[fn-79-P7991_2275057:796-nf] For the Creator's righteousness no less than His peace was announced in Christ, as we have often shown already. Therefore he says: \"He is our peace, who hath made both one\"[fn-79-P7992_2275308:797-nf] -that is, the Jewish nation and the Gentile world. What is near, and what was far off now that \"the middle wall has been broken down\" of their \"enmity,\" (are made one) \"in His flesh.\"[fn-79-P7993_2275512:798-nf] But Marcion erased the pronoun His, that he might make the enmity refer to flesh, as if (the apostle spoke) of a carnal enmity, instead of the enmity which was a rival to Christ.[fn-79-P7994_2275711:799-nf] And thus you have (as I have said elsewhere) exhibited the stupidity of Pontus, rather than the adroitness of a Marrucinian,[fn-79-P7995_2275894:800-nf] for you here deny him flesh to whom in the verse above you allowed blood! Since, however, He has made the law obsolete[fn-79-P7996_2276098:801-nf] by His own precepts, even by Himself fulfilling the law (for superfluous is, \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" when He says, \"Thou shalt not look on a woman to lust after her; \"superfluous also is, \"Thou shalt do no murder,\" when He says, \"Thou shalt not speak evil of thy neighbour,\") it is impossible to make an adversary of the law out of one who so completely promotes it.[fn-79-P7997_2276496:802-nf] \"For to create[fn-79-P7998_2276531:803-nf] in Himself of twain,\" for He who had made is also the same who creates (just as we have found it stated above: \"For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus\"),[fn-79-P7999_2276788:804-nf] \"one new man, making peace\" (really new, and really man-no phantom-but new, and newly born of a virgin by the Spirit of God), \"that He might reconcile both unto God\"[fn-80-P8000_2276974:805-nf] (even the God whom both races had offended-both Jew and Gentile), \"in one body,\" says he, \"having in it slain the enmity by the cross.\"[fn-80-P8001_2277133:806-nf] Thus we find from this passage also, that there was in Christ a fleshly body, such as was able to endure the cross. \"When, therefore, He came and preached peace to them that were near and to them which were afar off,\" we both obtained \"access to the Father,\" being \"now no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God\" (even of Him from whom, as we have shown above, we were aliens, and placed far off), \"built upon the foundation of the apostles\"[fn-80-P8002_2277652:807-nf] -(the apostle added), \"and the prophets; \"these words, however, the heretic erased, forgetting that the Lord had set in His Church not only apostles, but prophets also. He feared, no doubt, that our building was to stand in Christ upon the foundation of the ancient prophets,[fn-80-P8003_2277951:808-nf] since the apostle himself never fails to build us up everywhere with (the words of) the prophets. For whence did he learn to call Christ \"the chief corner-stone,\"[fn-80-P8004_2278282:809-nf] but from the figure given him in the Psalm: \"The stone which the builders rejected is become the head (stone) of the corner? \"[fn-80-P8005_2278429:810-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"62","folder":"ANF-03","text":"We have it on the true tradition[fn-79-P7952_2264515:757-nf] of the Church, that this epistle was sent to the Ephesians, not to the Laodiceans. Marcion, however, was very desirous of giving it the new rifle (of Laodicean),[fn-79-P7953_2264695:758-nf] as if he were extremely accurate in investigating such a point. But of what consequence are the titles, since in writing to a certain church the apostle did in fact write to all? It is certain that, whoever they were to whom he wrote,[fn-79-P7954_2264997:759-nf] he declared Him to be God in Christ with whom all things agree which are predicted. Now, to what god will most suitably belong all those things which relate to \"that good pleasure, which God hath purposed in the mystery of His will, that in the dispensation of the fulness of times He might recapitulate\" (if I may so say, according to the exact meaning of the Greek word[fn-79-P7955_2265389:760-nf] ) \"all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth,\"[fn-79-P7956_2265517:761-nf] but to Him whose are all things from their beginning, yea the beginning itself too; from whom issue the times and the dispensation of the fulness of times, according to which all things up to the very first are gathered up in Christ? What beginning, however, has the other god; that is to say, how can anything proceed from him, who has no work to show? And if there be no beginning, how can there be times? If no times, what fulness of times can there be? And if no fulness, what dispensation? Indeed, what has he ever done on earth, that any long dispensation of times to be fulfilled can be put to his account, for the accomplishment of all things in Christ, even of things in heaven? Nor can we possibly suppose that any things whatever have been at any time done in heaven by any other God than Him by whom, as all men allow, all things have been done on earth. Now, if it is impossible for all these things from the beginning to be reckoned to any other God than the Creator, who will believe that an alien god has recapitulated them in an alien Christ, instead of their own proper Author in His own Christ? If, again, they belong to the Creator, they must needs be separate from the other god; and if separate, then opposed to him. But then how can opposites be gathered together into him by whom they are in short destroyed? Again, what Christ do the following words announce, when the apostle says: \"That we should be to the praise of His glory, who first trusted in Christ? \"[fn-79-P7957_2267025:762-nf] Now who could have first trusted-i.e. previously trusted[fn-79-P7958_2267101:763-nf] -in God, before His advent, except the Jews to whom Christ was previously announced, from the beginning? He who was thus foretold, was also foretrusted. Hence the apostle refers the statement to himself, that is, to the Jews, in order that he may draw a distinction with respect to the Gentiles, (when he goes on to say: ) \"In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel (of your salvation); in whom ye believed, and were sealed with His Holy Spirit of promise.\"[fn-79-P7959_2267644:764-nf] Of what promise? That which was made through Joel: \"In the last days will I pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh,\"[fn-79-P7960_2267778:765-nf] that is, on all nations. Therefore the Spirit and the Gospel will be found in the Christ, who was foretrusted, because foretold. Again, \"the Father of glory\"[fn-79-P7961_2267956:766-nf] is He whose Christ, when ascending to heaven, is celebrated as \"the King of Glory\" in the Psalm: \"Who is this King of Glory? the Lord of Hosts, He is the King of Glory.\"[fn-79-P7962_2268146:767-nf] From Him also is besought \"the spirit of wisdom,\"[fn-79-P7963_2268217:768-nf] at whose disposal is enumerated that sevenfold distribution of the spirit of grace by Isaiah.[fn-79-P7964_2268330:769-nf] He likewise will grant \"the enlightenment of the eyes of the understanding,\"[fn-79-P7965_2268426:770-nf] who has also enriched our natural eyes with light; to whom, moreover, the blindness of the people is offensive: \"And who is blind, but my servants? ... yea, the servants of God have become blind.\"[fn-79-P7966_2268640:771-nf] In His gift, too, are \"the riches (of the glory) of His inheritance in the saints,\"[fn-79-P7967_2268754:772-nf] who promised such an inheritance in the call of the Gentiles: \"Ask of me, and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance.\"[fn-79-P7968_2268904:773-nf] It was He who \"wrought in Christ His mighty power, by raising Him from the dead, and setting Him at His own right hand, and putting all things under His feet\"[fn-79-P7969_2269081:774-nf] -even the same who said: \"Sit Thou on my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\"[fn-79-P7970_2269199:775-nf] For in another passage the Spirit says to the Father concerning the Son: \"Thou hast put all things under His feet.\"[fn-79-P7971_2269333:776-nf] Now, if from all these facts which are found in the Creator there is yet to be deduced[fn-79-P7972_2269440:777-nf] another god and another Christ, let us go in quest of the Creator. I suppose, forsooth,[fn-79-P7973_2269545:778-nf] we find Him, when he speaks of such as \"were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein they had walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, who worketh in the children of disobedience.\"[fn-79-P7974_2269792:779-nf] But Marcion must not here interpret the world as meaning the God of the world.[fn-79-P7975_2269893:780-nf] For a creature bears no resemblance to the Creator; the thing made, none to its Maker; the world, none to God. He, moreover, who is the Prince of the power of the ages must not be thought to be called the prince of the power of the air; for He who is chief over the higher powers derives no title from the lower powers, although these, too, may be ascribed to Him. Nor, again, can He possibly seem to be the instigator[fn-79-P7976_2270363:781-nf] of that unbelief which He Himself had rather to endure at the hand of the Jews and the Gentiles alike. We may therefore simply conclude that[fn-79-P7977_2270587:782-nf] these designations are unsuited to the Creator. There is another being to whom they are more applicable-and the apostle knew very well who that was. Who then is he? Undoubtedly he who has raised up \"children of disobedience\" against the Creator Himself ever since he took possession of that \"air\" of His; even as the prophet makes him say: \"I will set my throne above the stars; ... I will go up above the clouds; I will be like the Most High.\"[fn-79-P7978_2271057:783-nf] This must mean the devil, whom in another passage (since such will they there have the apostle's meaning to be) we shall recognize in the appellation the god of this world.[fn-79-P7979_2271297:784-nf] For he has filled the whole world with the lying pretence of his own divinity. To be sure,[fn-79-P7980_2271481:785-nf] if he had not existed, we might then possibly have applied these descriptions to the Creator. But the apostle, too, had lived in Judaism; and when he parenthetically observed of the sins (of that period of his life), \"in which also we all had our conversation in times past,\"[fn-79-P7981_2271798:786-nf] he must not be understood to indicate that the Creator was the lord of sinful men, and the prince of this air; but as meaning that in his Judaism he had been one of the children of disobedience, having the devil as his instigator-when he persecuted the church and the Christ of the Creator. Therefore he says: \"We also were the children of wrath,\" but \"by nature.\"[fn-79-P7982_2272182:787-nf] Let the heretic, however, not contend that, because the Creator called the Jews children, therefore the Creator is the lord of wrath.[fn-79-P7983_2272335:788-nf] For when (the apostle) says,\" We were by nature the children of wrath,\" inasmuch as the Jews were not the Creator's children by nature, but by the election of their fathers, he (must have) referred their being children of wrath to nature, and not to the Creator, adding this at lasts\" even as others,\"[fn-79-P7984_2272664:789-nf] who, of course, were not children of God. It is manifest that sins, and lusts of the flesh, and unbelief, and anger, are ascribed to the common nature of all mankind, the devil [however leading that nature astray,[fn-79-P7985_2272897:790-nf] which he has already infected with the implanted germ of sin. \"We,\" says he, \"are His workmanship, created in Christ.\"[fn-79-P7986_2273033:791-nf] It is one thing to make (as a workman), another thing to create. But he assigns both to One. Man is the workmanship of the Creator. He therefore who made man (at first), created him also in Christ. As touching the substance of nature, He \"made\" him; as touching the work of grace, He \"created\" him. Look also at what follows in connection with these words: \"Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which has the name of circumcision in the flesh made by the hand-that at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise,[fn-79-P7987_2273717:792-nf] having no hope, and without God in the world.\"[fn-79-P7988_2273817:793-nf] Now, without what God and without what Christ were these Gentiles?

Therefore he says: \"We also were the children of wrath,\" but \"by nature.\"[fn-79-P7982_2272182:787-nf] Let the heretic, however, not contend that, because the Creator called the Jews children, therefore the Creator is the lord of wrath.[fn-79-P7983_2272335:788-nf] For when (the apostle) says,\" We were by nature the children of wrath,\" inasmuch as the Jews were not the Creator's children by nature, but by the election of their fathers, he (must have) referred their being children of wrath to nature, and not to the Creator, adding this at lasts\" even as others,\"[fn-79-P7984_2272664:789-nf] who, of course, were not children of God. It is manifest that sins, and lusts of the flesh, and unbelief, and anger, are ascribed to the common nature of all mankind, the devil [however leading that nature astray,[fn-79-P7985_2272897:790-nf] which he has already infected with the implanted germ of sin. \"We,\" says he, \"are His workmanship, created in Christ.\"[fn-79-P7986_2273033:791-nf] It is one thing to make (as a workman), another thing to create. But he assigns both to One. Man is the workmanship of the Creator. He therefore who made man (at first), created him also in Christ. As touching the substance of nature, He \"made\" him; as touching the work of grace, He \"created\" him. Look also at what follows in connection with these words: \"Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which has the name of circumcision in the flesh made by the hand-that at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise,[fn-79-P7987_2273717:792-nf] having no hope, and without God in the world.\"[fn-79-P7988_2273817:793-nf] Now, without what God and without what Christ were these Gentiles? Surely, without Him to whom the commonwealth[fn-79-P7989_2273953:794-nf] of Israel belonged, and the covenants and the promise. \"But now in Christ,\" says he, \"ye who were sometimes far off are made nigh by His blood.\"[fn-79-P7990_2274153:795-nf] From whom were they far off before? From the privileges) whereof he speaks above, even tom the Christ of the Creator, from the commonwealth of Israel, from the covenants, from the hope of the promise, from God Himself. Since this is the case, the Gentiles are consequently now in Christ made nigh to these (blessings), from which they were once far off. But if we are in Christ brought so very nigh to the commonwealth of Israel, which comprises the religion of the divine Creator, and to the covenants and to the promise, yea to their very God Himself, it is quite ridiculous (to suppose that) the Christ of the other god has brought us to this proximity to the Creator from afar. The apostle had in mind that it had been predicted concerning the call of the Gentiles from their distant alienation in words like these: \"They who were far off from me have come to my righteousness.\"[fn-79-P7991_2275057:796-nf] For the Creator's righteousness no less than His peace was announced in Christ, as we have often shown already. Therefore he says: \"He is our peace, who hath made both one\"[fn-79-P7992_2275308:797-nf] -that is, the Jewish nation and the Gentile world. What is near, and what was far off now that \"the middle wall has been broken down\" of their \"enmity,\" (are made one) \"in His flesh.\"[fn-79-P7993_2275512:798-nf] But Marcion erased the pronoun His, that he might make the enmity refer to flesh, as if (the apostle spoke) of a carnal enmity, instead of the enmity which was a rival to Christ.[fn-79-P7994_2275711:799-nf] And thus you have (as I have said elsewhere) exhibited the stupidity of Pontus, rather than the adroitness of a Marrucinian,[fn-79-P7995_2275894:800-nf] for you here deny him flesh to whom in the verse above you allowed blood! Since, however, He has made the law obsolete[fn-79-P7996_2276098:801-nf] by His own precepts, even by Himself fulfilling the law (for superfluous is, \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" when He says, \"Thou shalt not look on a woman to lust after her; \"superfluous also is, \"Thou shalt do no murder,\" when He says, \"Thou shalt not speak evil of thy neighbour,\") it is impossible to make an adversary of the law out of one who so completely promotes it.[fn-79-P7997_2276496:802-nf] \"For to create[fn-79-P7998_2276531:803-nf] in Himself of twain,\" for He who had made is also the same who creates (just as we have found it stated above: \"For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus\"),[fn-79-P7999_2276788:804-nf] \"one new man, making peace\" (really new, and really man-no phantom-but new, and newly born of a virgin by the Spirit of God), \"that He might reconcile both unto God\"[fn-80-P8000_2276974:805-nf] (even the God whom both races had offended-both Jew and Gentile), \"in one body,\" says he, \"having in it slain the enmity by the cross.\"[fn-80-P8001_2277133:806-nf] Thus we find from this passage also, that there was in Christ a fleshly body, such as was able to endure the cross. \"When, therefore, He came and preached peace to them that were near and to them which were afar off,\" we both obtained \"access to the Father,\" being \"now no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God\" (even of Him from whom, as we have shown above, we were aliens, and placed far off), \"built upon the foundation of the apostles\"[fn-80-P8002_2277652:807-nf] -(the apostle added), \"and the prophets; \"these words, however, the heretic erased, forgetting that the Lord had set in His Church not only apostles, but prophets also. He feared, no doubt, that our building was to stand in Christ upon the foundation of the ancient prophets,[fn-80-P8003_2277951:808-nf] since the apostle himself never fails to build us up everywhere with (the words of) the prophets. For whence did he learn to call Christ \"the chief corner-stone,\"[fn-80-P8004_2278282:809-nf] but from the figure given him in the Psalm: \"The stone which the builders rejected is become the head (stone) of the corner? \"[fn-80-P8005_2278429:810-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"62","folder":"ANF-03","text":"We have it on the true tradition[fn-79-P7952_2264515:757-nf] of the Church, that this epistle was sent to the Ephesians, not to the Laodiceans. Marcion, however, was very desirous of giving it the new rifle (of Laodicean),[fn-79-P7953_2264695:758-nf] as if he were extremely accurate in investigating such a point. But of what consequence are the titles, since in writing to a certain church the apostle did in fact write to all? It is certain that, whoever they were to whom he wrote,[fn-79-P7954_2264997:759-nf] he declared Him to be God in Christ with whom all things agree which are predicted. Now, to what god will most suitably belong all those things which relate to \"that good pleasure, which God hath purposed in the mystery of His will, that in the dispensation of the fulness of times He might recapitulate\" (if I may so say, according to the exact meaning of the Greek word[fn-79-P7955_2265389:760-nf] ) \"all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth,\"[fn-79-P7956_2265517:761-nf] but to Him whose are all things from their beginning, yea the beginning itself too; from whom issue the times and the dispensation of the fulness of times, according to which all things up to the very first are gathered up in Christ? What beginning, however, has the other god; that is to say, how can anything proceed from him, who has no work to show? And if there be no beginning, how can there be times? If no times, what fulness of times can there be? And if no fulness, what dispensation? Indeed, what has he ever done on earth, that any long dispensation of times to be fulfilled can be put to his account, for the accomplishment of all things in Christ, even of things in heaven? Nor can we possibly suppose that any things whatever have been at any time done in heaven by any other God than Him by whom, as all men allow, all things have been done on earth. Now, if it is impossible for all these things from the beginning to be reckoned to any other God than the Creator, who will believe that an alien god has recapitulated them in an alien Christ, instead of their own proper Author in His own Christ? If, again, they belong to the Creator, they must needs be separate from the other god; and if separate, then opposed to him. But then how can opposites be gathered together into him by whom they are in short destroyed? Again, what Christ do the following words announce, when the apostle says: \"That we should be to the praise of His glory, who first trusted in Christ? \"[fn-79-P7957_2267025:762-nf] Now who could have first trusted-i.e. previously trusted[fn-79-P7958_2267101:763-nf] -in God, before His advent, except the Jews to whom Christ was previously announced, from the beginning? He who was thus foretold, was also foretrusted. Hence the apostle refers the statement to himself, that is, to the Jews, in order that he may draw a distinction with respect to the Gentiles, (when he goes on to say: ) \"In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel (of your salvation); in whom ye believed, and were sealed with His Holy Spirit of promise.\"[fn-79-P7959_2267644:764-nf] Of what promise? That which was made through Joel: \"In the last days will I pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh,\"[fn-79-P7960_2267778:765-nf] that is, on all nations. Therefore the Spirit and the Gospel will be found in the Christ, who was foretrusted, because foretold. Again, \"the Father of glory\"[fn-79-P7961_2267956:766-nf] is He whose Christ, when ascending to heaven, is celebrated as \"the King of Glory\" in the Psalm: \"Who is this King of Glory? the Lord of Hosts, He is the King of Glory.\"[fn-79-P7962_2268146:767-nf] From Him also is besought \"the spirit of wisdom,\"[fn-79-P7963_2268217:768-nf] at whose disposal is enumerated that sevenfold distribution of the spirit of grace by Isaiah.[fn-79-P7964_2268330:769-nf] He likewise will grant \"the enlightenment of the eyes of the understanding,\"[fn-79-P7965_2268426:770-nf] who has also enriched our natural eyes with light; to whom, moreover, the blindness of the people is offensive: \"And who is blind, but my servants? ... yea, the servants of God have become blind.\"[fn-79-P7966_2268640:771-nf] In His gift, too, are \"the riches (of the glory) of His inheritance in the saints,\"[fn-79-P7967_2268754:772-nf] who promised such an inheritance in the call of the Gentiles: \"Ask of me, and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance.\"[fn-79-P7968_2268904:773-nf] It was He who \"wrought in Christ His mighty power, by raising Him from the dead, and setting Him at His own right hand, and putting all things under His feet\"[fn-79-P7969_2269081:774-nf] -even the same who said: \"Sit Thou on my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\"[fn-79-P7970_2269199:775-nf] For in another passage the Spirit says to the Father concerning the Son: \"Thou hast put all things under His feet.\"[fn-79-P7971_2269333:776-nf] Now, if from all these facts which are found in the Creator there is yet to be deduced[fn-79-P7972_2269440:777-nf] another god and another Christ, let us go in quest of the Creator. I suppose, forsooth,[fn-79-P7973_2269545:778-nf] we find Him, when he speaks of such as \"were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein they had walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, who worketh in the children of disobedience.\"[fn-79-P7974_2269792:779-nf] But Marcion must not here interpret the world as meaning the God of the world.[fn-79-P7975_2269893:780-nf] For a creature bears no resemblance to the Creator; the thing made, none to its Maker; the world, none to God. He, moreover, who is the Prince of the power of the ages must not be thought to be called the prince of the power of the air; for He who is chief over the higher powers derives no title from the lower powers, although these, too, may be ascribed to Him. Nor, again, can He possibly seem to be the instigator[fn-79-P7976_2270363:781-nf] of that unbelief which He Himself had rather to endure at the hand of the Jews and the Gentiles alike. We may therefore simply conclude that[fn-79-P7977_2270587:782-nf] these designations are unsuited to the Creator. There is another being to whom they are more applicable-and the apostle knew very well who that was. Who then is he? Undoubtedly he who has raised up \"children of disobedience\" against the Creator Himself ever since he took possession of that \"air\" of His; even as the prophet makes him say: \"I will set my throne above the stars; ... I will go up above the clouds; I will be like the Most High.\"[fn-79-P7978_2271057:783-nf] This must mean the devil, whom in another passage (since such will they there have the apostle's meaning to be) we shall recognize in the appellation the god of this world.[fn-79-P7979_2271297:784-nf] For he has filled the whole world with the lying pretence of his own divinity. To be sure,[fn-79-P7980_2271481:785-nf] if he had not existed, we might then possibly have applied these descriptions to the Creator. But the apostle, too, had lived in Judaism; and when he parenthetically observed of the sins (of that period of his life), \"in which also we all had our conversation in times past,\"[fn-79-P7981_2271798:786-nf] he must not be understood to indicate that the Creator was the lord of sinful men, and the prince of this air; but as meaning that in his Judaism he had been one of the children of disobedience, having the devil as his instigator-when he persecuted the church and the Christ of the Creator.

Nor, again, can He possibly seem to be the instigator[fn-79-P7976_2270363:781-nf] of that unbelief which He Himself had rather to endure at the hand of the Jews and the Gentiles alike. We may therefore simply conclude that[fn-79-P7977_2270587:782-nf] these designations are unsuited to the Creator. There is another being to whom they are more applicable-and the apostle knew very well who that was. Who then is he? Undoubtedly he who has raised up \"children of disobedience\" against the Creator Himself ever since he took possession of that \"air\" of His; even as the prophet makes him say: \"I will set my throne above the stars; ... I will go up above the clouds; I will be like the Most High.\"[fn-79-P7978_2271057:783-nf] This must mean the devil, whom in another passage (since such will they there have the apostle's meaning to be) we shall recognize in the appellation the god of this world.[fn-79-P7979_2271297:784-nf] For he has filled the whole world with the lying pretence of his own divinity. To be sure,[fn-79-P7980_2271481:785-nf] if he had not existed, we might then possibly have applied these descriptions to the Creator. But the apostle, too, had lived in Judaism; and when he parenthetically observed of the sins (of that period of his life), \"in which also we all had our conversation in times past,\"[fn-79-P7981_2271798:786-nf] he must not be understood to indicate that the Creator was the lord of sinful men, and the prince of this air; but as meaning that in his Judaism he had been one of the children of disobedience, having the devil as his instigator-when he persecuted the church and the Christ of the Creator. Therefore he says: \"We also were the children of wrath,\" but \"by nature.\"[fn-79-P7982_2272182:787-nf] Let the heretic, however, not contend that, because the Creator called the Jews children, therefore the Creator is the lord of wrath.[fn-79-P7983_2272335:788-nf] For when (the apostle) says,\" We were by nature the children of wrath,\" inasmuch as the Jews were not the Creator's children by nature, but by the election of their fathers, he (must have) referred their being children of wrath to nature, and not to the Creator, adding this at lasts\" even as others,\"[fn-79-P7984_2272664:789-nf] who, of course, were not children of God. It is manifest that sins, and lusts of the flesh, and unbelief, and anger, are ascribed to the common nature of all mankind, the devil [however leading that nature astray,[fn-79-P7985_2272897:790-nf] which he has already infected with the implanted germ of sin. \"We,\" says he, \"are His workmanship, created in Christ.\"[fn-79-P7986_2273033:791-nf] It is one thing to make (as a workman), another thing to create. But he assigns both to One. Man is the workmanship of the Creator. He therefore who made man (at first), created him also in Christ. As touching the substance of nature, He \"made\" him; as touching the work of grace, He \"created\" him. Look also at what follows in connection with these words: \"Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which has the name of circumcision in the flesh made by the hand-that at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise,[fn-79-P7987_2273717:792-nf] having no hope, and without God in the world.\"[fn-79-P7988_2273817:793-nf] Now, without what God and without what Christ were these Gentiles? Surely, without Him to whom the commonwealth[fn-79-P7989_2273953:794-nf] of Israel belonged, and the covenants and the promise. \"But now in Christ,\" says he, \"ye who were sometimes far off are made nigh by His blood.\"[fn-79-P7990_2274153:795-nf] From whom were they far off before? From the privileges) whereof he speaks above, even tom the Christ of the Creator, from the commonwealth of Israel, from the covenants, from the hope of the promise, from God Himself. Since this is the case, the Gentiles are consequently now in Christ made nigh to these (blessings), from which they were once far off. But if we are in Christ brought so very nigh to the commonwealth of Israel, which comprises the religion of the divine Creator, and to the covenants and to the promise, yea to their very God Himself, it is quite ridiculous (to suppose that) the Christ of the other god has brought us to this proximity to the Creator from afar. The apostle had in mind that it had been predicted concerning the call of the Gentiles from their distant alienation in words like these: \"They who were far off from me have come to my righteousness.\"[fn-79-P7991_2275057:796-nf] For the Creator's righteousness no less than His peace was announced in Christ, as we have often shown already. Therefore he says: \"He is our peace, who hath made both one\"[fn-79-P7992_2275308:797-nf] -that is, the Jewish nation and the Gentile world. What is near, and what was far off now that \"the middle wall has been broken down\" of their \"enmity,\" (are made one) \"in His flesh.\"[fn-79-P7993_2275512:798-nf] But Marcion erased the pronoun His, that he might make the enmity refer to flesh, as if (the apostle spoke) of a carnal enmity, instead of the enmity which was a rival to Christ.[fn-79-P7994_2275711:799-nf] And thus you have (as I have said elsewhere) exhibited the stupidity of Pontus, rather than the adroitness of a Marrucinian,[fn-79-P7995_2275894:800-nf] for you here deny him flesh to whom in the verse above you allowed blood! Since, however, He has made the law obsolete[fn-79-P7996_2276098:801-nf] by His own precepts, even by Himself fulfilling the law (for superfluous is, \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" when He says, \"Thou shalt not look on a woman to lust after her; \"superfluous also is, \"Thou shalt do no murder,\" when He says, \"Thou shalt not speak evil of thy neighbour,\") it is impossible to make an adversary of the law out of one who so completely promotes it.[fn-79-P7997_2276496:802-nf] \"For to create[fn-79-P7998_2276531:803-nf] in Himself of twain,\" for He who had made is also the same who creates (just as we have found it stated above: \"For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus\"),[fn-79-P7999_2276788:804-nf] \"one new man, making peace\" (really new, and really man-no phantom-but new, and newly born of a virgin by the Spirit of God), \"that He might reconcile both unto God\"[fn-80-P8000_2276974:805-nf] (even the God whom both races had offended-both Jew and Gentile), \"in one body,\" says he, \"having in it slain the enmity by the cross.\"[fn-80-P8001_2277133:806-nf] Thus we find from this passage also, that there was in Christ a fleshly body, such as was able to endure the cross. \"When, therefore, He came and preached peace to them that were near and to them which were afar off,\" we both obtained \"access to the Father,\" being \"now no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God\" (even of Him from whom, as we have shown above, we were aliens, and placed far off), \"built upon the foundation of the apostles\"[fn-80-P8002_2277652:807-nf] -(the apostle added), \"and the prophets; \"these words, however, the heretic erased, forgetting that the Lord had set in His Church not only apostles, but prophets also. He feared, no doubt, that our building was to stand in Christ upon the foundation of the ancient prophets,[fn-80-P8003_2277951:808-nf] since the apostle himself never fails to build us up everywhere with (the words of) the prophets. For whence did he learn to call Christ \"the chief corner-stone,\"[fn-80-P8004_2278282:809-nf] but from the figure given him in the Psalm: \"The stone which the builders rejected is become the head (stone) of the corner? \"[fn-80-P8005_2278429:810-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"62","folder":"ANF-03","text":"We have it on the true tradition[fn-79-P7952_2264515:757-nf] of the Church, that this epistle was sent to the Ephesians, not to the Laodiceans. Marcion, however, was very desirous of giving it the new rifle (of Laodicean),[fn-79-P7953_2264695:758-nf] as if he were extremely accurate in investigating such a point. But of what consequence are the titles, since in writing to a certain church the apostle did in fact write to all? It is certain that, whoever they were to whom he wrote,[fn-79-P7954_2264997:759-nf] he declared Him to be God in Christ with whom all things agree which are predicted. Now, to what god will most suitably belong all those things which relate to \"that good pleasure, which God hath purposed in the mystery of His will, that in the dispensation of the fulness of times He might recapitulate\" (if I may so say, according to the exact meaning of the Greek word[fn-79-P7955_2265389:760-nf] ) \"all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth,\"[fn-79-P7956_2265517:761-nf] but to Him whose are all things from their beginning, yea the beginning itself too; from whom issue the times and the dispensation of the fulness of times, according to which all things up to the very first are gathered up in Christ? What beginning, however, has the other god; that is to say, how can anything proceed from him, who has no work to show? And if there be no beginning, how can there be times? If no times, what fulness of times can there be? And if no fulness, what dispensation? Indeed, what has he ever done on earth, that any long dispensation of times to be fulfilled can be put to his account, for the accomplishment of all things in Christ, even of things in heaven? Nor can we possibly suppose that any things whatever have been at any time done in heaven by any other God than Him by whom, as all men allow, all things have been done on earth. Now, if it is impossible for all these things from the beginning to be reckoned to any other God than the Creator, who will believe that an alien god has recapitulated them in an alien Christ, instead of their own proper Author in His own Christ? If, again, they belong to the Creator, they must needs be separate from the other god; and if separate, then opposed to him. But then how can opposites be gathered together into him by whom they are in short destroyed? Again, what Christ do the following words announce, when the apostle says: \"That we should be to the praise of His glory, who first trusted in Christ? \"[fn-79-P7957_2267025:762-nf] Now who could have first trusted-i.e. previously trusted[fn-79-P7958_2267101:763-nf] -in God, before His advent, except the Jews to whom Christ was previously announced, from the beginning? He who was thus foretold, was also foretrusted. Hence the apostle refers the statement to himself, that is, to the Jews, in order that he may draw a distinction with respect to the Gentiles, (when he goes on to say: ) \"In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel (of your salvation); in whom ye believed, and were sealed with His Holy Spirit of promise.\"[fn-79-P7959_2267644:764-nf] Of what promise? That which was made through Joel: \"In the last days will I pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh,\"[fn-79-P7960_2267778:765-nf] that is, on all nations. Therefore the Spirit and the Gospel will be found in the Christ, who was foretrusted, because foretold. Again, \"the Father of glory\"[fn-79-P7961_2267956:766-nf] is He whose Christ, when ascending to heaven, is celebrated as \"the King of Glory\" in the Psalm: \"Who is this King of Glory? the Lord of Hosts, He is the King of Glory.\"[fn-79-P7962_2268146:767-nf] From Him also is besought \"the spirit of wisdom,\"[fn-79-P7963_2268217:768-nf] at whose disposal is enumerated that sevenfold distribution of the spirit of grace by Isaiah.[fn-79-P7964_2268330:769-nf] He likewise will grant \"the enlightenment of the eyes of the understanding,\"[fn-79-P7965_2268426:770-nf] who has also enriched our natural eyes with light; to whom, moreover, the blindness of the people is offensive: \"And who is blind, but my servants? ... yea, the servants of God have become blind.\"[fn-79-P7966_2268640:771-nf] In His gift, too, are \"the riches (of the glory) of His inheritance in the saints,\"[fn-79-P7967_2268754:772-nf] who promised such an inheritance in the call of the Gentiles: \"Ask of me, and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance.\"[fn-79-P7968_2268904:773-nf] It was He who \"wrought in Christ His mighty power, by raising Him from the dead, and setting Him at His own right hand, and putting all things under His feet\"[fn-79-P7969_2269081:774-nf] -even the same who said: \"Sit Thou on my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\"[fn-79-P7970_2269199:775-nf] For in another passage the Spirit says to the Father concerning the Son: \"Thou hast put all things under His feet.\"[fn-79-P7971_2269333:776-nf] Now, if from all these facts which are found in the Creator there is yet to be deduced[fn-79-P7972_2269440:777-nf] another god and another Christ, let us go in quest of the Creator. I suppose, forsooth,[fn-79-P7973_2269545:778-nf] we find Him, when he speaks of such as \"were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein they had walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, who worketh in the children of disobedience.\"[fn-79-P7974_2269792:779-nf] But Marcion must not here interpret the world as meaning the God of the world.[fn-79-P7975_2269893:780-nf] For a creature bears no resemblance to the Creator; the thing made, none to its Maker; the world, none to God.

Again, \"the Father of glory\"[fn-79-P7961_2267956:766-nf] is He whose Christ, when ascending to heaven, is celebrated as \"the King of Glory\" in the Psalm: \"Who is this King of Glory? the Lord of Hosts, He is the King of Glory.\"[fn-79-P7962_2268146:767-nf] From Him also is besought \"the spirit of wisdom,\"[fn-79-P7963_2268217:768-nf] at whose disposal is enumerated that sevenfold distribution of the spirit of grace by Isaiah.[fn-79-P7964_2268330:769-nf] He likewise will grant \"the enlightenment of the eyes of the understanding,\"[fn-79-P7965_2268426:770-nf] who has also enriched our natural eyes with light; to whom, moreover, the blindness of the people is offensive: \"And who is blind, but my servants? ... yea, the servants of God have become blind.\"[fn-79-P7966_2268640:771-nf] In His gift, too, are \"the riches (of the glory) of His inheritance in the saints,\"[fn-79-P7967_2268754:772-nf] who promised such an inheritance in the call of the Gentiles: \"Ask of me, and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance.\"[fn-79-P7968_2268904:773-nf] It was He who \"wrought in Christ His mighty power, by raising Him from the dead, and setting Him at His own right hand, and putting all things under His feet\"[fn-79-P7969_2269081:774-nf] -even the same who said: \"Sit Thou on my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\"[fn-79-P7970_2269199:775-nf] For in another passage the Spirit says to the Father concerning the Son: \"Thou hast put all things under His feet.\"[fn-79-P7971_2269333:776-nf] Now, if from all these facts which are found in the Creator there is yet to be deduced[fn-79-P7972_2269440:777-nf] another god and another Christ, let us go in quest of the Creator. I suppose, forsooth,[fn-79-P7973_2269545:778-nf] we find Him, when he speaks of such as \"were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein they had walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, who worketh in the children of disobedience.\"[fn-79-P7974_2269792:779-nf] But Marcion must not here interpret the world as meaning the God of the world.[fn-79-P7975_2269893:780-nf] For a creature bears no resemblance to the Creator; the thing made, none to its Maker; the world, none to God. He, moreover, who is the Prince of the power of the ages must not be thought to be called the prince of the power of the air; for He who is chief over the higher powers derives no title from the lower powers, although these, too, may be ascribed to Him. Nor, again, can He possibly seem to be the instigator[fn-79-P7976_2270363:781-nf] of that unbelief which He Himself had rather to endure at the hand of the Jews and the Gentiles alike. We may therefore simply conclude that[fn-79-P7977_2270587:782-nf] these designations are unsuited to the Creator. There is another being to whom they are more applicable-and the apostle knew very well who that was. Who then is he? Undoubtedly he who has raised up \"children of disobedience\" against the Creator Himself ever since he took possession of that \"air\" of His; even as the prophet makes him say: \"I will set my throne above the stars; ... I will go up above the clouds; I will be like the Most High.\"[fn-79-P7978_2271057:783-nf] This must mean the devil, whom in another passage (since such will they there have the apostle's meaning to be) we shall recognize in the appellation the god of this world.[fn-79-P7979_2271297:784-nf] For he has filled the whole world with the lying pretence of his own divinity. To be sure,[fn-79-P7980_2271481:785-nf] if he had not existed, we might then possibly have applied these descriptions to the Creator. But the apostle, too, had lived in Judaism; and when he parenthetically observed of the sins (of that period of his life), \"in which also we all had our conversation in times past,\"[fn-79-P7981_2271798:786-nf] he must not be understood to indicate that the Creator was the lord of sinful men, and the prince of this air; but as meaning that in his Judaism he had been one of the children of disobedience, having the devil as his instigator-when he persecuted the church and the Christ of the Creator. Therefore he says: \"We also were the children of wrath,\" but \"by nature.\"[fn-79-P7982_2272182:787-nf] Let the heretic, however, not contend that, because the Creator called the Jews children, therefore the Creator is the lord of wrath.[fn-79-P7983_2272335:788-nf] For when (the apostle) says,\" We were by nature the children of wrath,\" inasmuch as the Jews were not the Creator's children by nature, but by the election of their fathers, he (must have) referred their being children of wrath to nature, and not to the Creator, adding this at lasts\" even as others,\"[fn-79-P7984_2272664:789-nf] who, of course, were not children of God. It is manifest that sins, and lusts of the flesh, and unbelief, and anger, are ascribed to the common nature of all mankind, the devil [however leading that nature astray,[fn-79-P7985_2272897:790-nf] which he has already infected with the implanted germ of sin. \"We,\" says he, \"are His workmanship, created in Christ.\"[fn-79-P7986_2273033:791-nf] It is one thing to make (as a workman), another thing to create. But he assigns both to One. Man is the workmanship of the Creator. He therefore who made man (at first), created him also in Christ. As touching the substance of nature, He \"made\" him; as touching the work of grace, He \"created\" him. Look also at what follows in connection with these words: \"Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which has the name of circumcision in the flesh made by the hand-that at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise,[fn-79-P7987_2273717:792-nf] having no hope, and without God in the world.\"[fn-79-P7988_2273817:793-nf] Now, without what God and without what Christ were these Gentiles? Surely, without Him to whom the commonwealth[fn-79-P7989_2273953:794-nf] of Israel belonged, and the covenants and the promise. \"But now in Christ,\" says he, \"ye who were sometimes far off are made nigh by His blood.\"[fn-79-P7990_2274153:795-nf] From whom were they far off before? From the privileges) whereof he speaks above, even tom the Christ of the Creator, from the commonwealth of Israel, from the covenants, from the hope of the promise, from God Himself. Since this is the case, the Gentiles are consequently now in Christ made nigh to these (blessings), from which they were once far off. But if we are in Christ brought so very nigh to the commonwealth of Israel, which comprises the religion of the divine Creator, and to the covenants and to the promise, yea to their very God Himself, it is quite ridiculous (to suppose that) the Christ of the other god has brought us to this proximity to the Creator from afar. The apostle had in mind that it had been predicted concerning the call of the Gentiles from their distant alienation in words like these: \"They who were far off from me have come to my righteousness.\"[fn-79-P7991_2275057:796-nf] For the Creator's righteousness no less than His peace was announced in Christ, as we have often shown already. Therefore he says: \"He is our peace, who hath made both one\"[fn-79-P7992_2275308:797-nf] -that is, the Jewish nation and the Gentile world. What is near, and what was far off now that \"the middle wall has been broken down\" of their \"enmity,\" (are made one) \"in His flesh.\"[fn-79-P7993_2275512:798-nf] But Marcion erased the pronoun His, that he might make the enmity refer to flesh, as if (the apostle spoke) of a carnal enmity, instead of the enmity which was a rival to Christ.[fn-79-P7994_2275711:799-nf] And thus you have (as I have said elsewhere) exhibited the stupidity of Pontus, rather than the adroitness of a Marrucinian,[fn-79-P7995_2275894:800-nf] for you here deny him flesh to whom in the verse above you allowed blood! Since, however, He has made the law obsolete[fn-79-P7996_2276098:801-nf] by His own precepts, even by Himself fulfilling the law (for superfluous is, \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" when He says, \"Thou shalt not look on a woman to lust after her; \"superfluous also is, \"Thou shalt do no murder,\" when He says, \"Thou shalt not speak evil of thy neighbour,\") it is impossible to make an adversary of the law out of one who so completely promotes it.[fn-79-P7997_2276496:802-nf] \"For to create[fn-79-P7998_2276531:803-nf] in Himself of twain,\" for He who had made is also the same who creates (just as we have found it stated above: \"For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus\"),[fn-79-P7999_2276788:804-nf] \"one new man, making peace\" (really new, and really man-no phantom-but new, and newly born of a virgin by the Spirit of God), \"that He might reconcile both unto God\"[fn-80-P8000_2276974:805-nf] (even the God whom both races had offended-both Jew and Gentile), \"in one body,\" says he, \"having in it slain the enmity by the cross.\"[fn-80-P8001_2277133:806-nf] Thus we find from this passage also, that there was in Christ a fleshly body, such as was able to endure the cross. \"When, therefore, He came and preached peace to them that were near and to them which were afar off,\" we both obtained \"access to the Father,\" being \"now no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God\" (even of Him from whom, as we have shown above, we were aliens, and placed far off), \"built upon the foundation of the apostles\"[fn-80-P8002_2277652:807-nf] -(the apostle added), \"and the prophets; \"these words, however, the heretic erased, forgetting that the Lord had set in His Church not only apostles, but prophets also. He feared, no doubt, that our building was to stand in Christ upon the foundation of the ancient prophets,[fn-80-P8003_2277951:808-nf] since the apostle himself never fails to build us up everywhere with (the words of) the prophets. For whence did he learn to call Christ \"the chief corner-stone,\"[fn-80-P8004_2278282:809-nf] but from the figure given him in the Psalm: \"The stone which the builders rejected is become the head (stone) of the corner? \"[fn-80-P8005_2278429:810-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"62","folder":"ANF-03","text":"We have it on the true tradition[fn-79-P7952_2264515:757-nf] of the Church, that this epistle was sent to the Ephesians, not to the Laodiceans. Marcion, however, was very desirous of giving it the new rifle (of Laodicean),[fn-79-P7953_2264695:758-nf] as if he were extremely accurate in investigating such a point. But of what consequence are the titles, since in writing to a certain church the apostle did in fact write to all? It is certain that, whoever they were to whom he wrote,[fn-79-P7954_2264997:759-nf] he declared Him to be God in Christ with whom all things agree which are predicted. Now, to what god will most suitably belong all those things which relate to \"that good pleasure, which God hath purposed in the mystery of His will, that in the dispensation of the fulness of times He might recapitulate\" (if I may so say, according to the exact meaning of the Greek word[fn-79-P7955_2265389:760-nf] ) \"all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth,\"[fn-79-P7956_2265517:761-nf] but to Him whose are all things from their beginning, yea the beginning itself too; from whom issue the times and the dispensation of the fulness of times, according to which all things up to the very first are gathered up in Christ? What beginning, however, has the other god; that is to say, how can anything proceed from him, who has no work to show? And if there be no beginning, how can there be times? If no times, what fulness of times can there be? And if no fulness, what dispensation? Indeed, what has he ever done on earth, that any long dispensation of times to be fulfilled can be put to his account, for the accomplishment of all things in Christ, even of things in heaven? Nor can we possibly suppose that any things whatever have been at any time done in heaven by any other God than Him by whom, as all men allow, all things have been done on earth. Now, if it is impossible for all these things from the beginning to be reckoned to any other God than the Creator, who will believe that an alien god has recapitulated them in an alien Christ, instead of their own proper Author in His own Christ? If, again, they belong to the Creator, they must needs be separate from the other god; and if separate, then opposed to him. But then how can opposites be gathered together into him by whom they are in short destroyed? Again, what Christ do the following words announce, when the apostle says: \"That we should be to the praise of His glory, who first trusted in Christ? \"[fn-79-P7957_2267025:762-nf] Now who could have first trusted-i.e. previously trusted[fn-79-P7958_2267101:763-nf] -in God, before His advent, except the Jews to whom Christ was previously announced, from the beginning? He who was thus foretold, was also foretrusted. Hence the apostle refers the statement to himself, that is, to the Jews, in order that he may draw a distinction with respect to the Gentiles, (when he goes on to say: ) \"In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel (of your salvation); in whom ye believed, and were sealed with His Holy Spirit of promise.\"[fn-79-P7959_2267644:764-nf] Of what promise? That which was made through Joel: \"In the last days will I pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh,\"[fn-79-P7960_2267778:765-nf] that is, on all nations.

Now, if it is impossible for all these things from the beginning to be reckoned to any other God than the Creator, who will believe that an alien god has recapitulated them in an alien Christ, instead of their own proper Author in His own Christ? If, again, they belong to the Creator, they must needs be separate from the other god; and if separate, then opposed to him. But then how can opposites be gathered together into him by whom they are in short destroyed? Again, what Christ do the following words announce, when the apostle says: \"That we should be to the praise of His glory, who first trusted in Christ? \"[fn-79-P7957_2267025:762-nf] Now who could have first trusted-i.e. previously trusted[fn-79-P7958_2267101:763-nf] -in God, before His advent, except the Jews to whom Christ was previously announced, from the beginning? He who was thus foretold, was also foretrusted. Hence the apostle refers the statement to himself, that is, to the Jews, in order that he may draw a distinction with respect to the Gentiles, (when he goes on to say: ) \"In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel (of your salvation); in whom ye believed, and were sealed with His Holy Spirit of promise.\"[fn-79-P7959_2267644:764-nf] Of what promise? That which was made through Joel: \"In the last days will I pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh,\"[fn-79-P7960_2267778:765-nf] that is, on all nations. Therefore the Spirit and the Gospel will be found in the Christ, who was foretrusted, because foretold. Again, \"the Father of glory\"[fn-79-P7961_2267956:766-nf] is He whose Christ, when ascending to heaven, is celebrated as \"the King of Glory\" in the Psalm: \"Who is this King of Glory? the Lord of Hosts, He is the King of Glory.\"[fn-79-P7962_2268146:767-nf] From Him also is besought \"the spirit of wisdom,\"[fn-79-P7963_2268217:768-nf] at whose disposal is enumerated that sevenfold distribution of the spirit of grace by Isaiah.[fn-79-P7964_2268330:769-nf] He likewise will grant \"the enlightenment of the eyes of the understanding,\"[fn-79-P7965_2268426:770-nf] who has also enriched our natural eyes with light; to whom, moreover, the blindness of the people is offensive: \"And who is blind, but my servants? ... yea, the servants of God have become blind.\"[fn-79-P7966_2268640:771-nf] In His gift, too, are \"the riches (of the glory) of His inheritance in the saints,\"[fn-79-P7967_2268754:772-nf] who promised such an inheritance in the call of the Gentiles: \"Ask of me, and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance.\"[fn-79-P7968_2268904:773-nf] It was He who \"wrought in Christ His mighty power, by raising Him from the dead, and setting Him at His own right hand, and putting all things under His feet\"[fn-79-P7969_2269081:774-nf] -even the same who said: \"Sit Thou on my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\"[fn-79-P7970_2269199:775-nf] For in another passage the Spirit says to the Father concerning the Son: \"Thou hast put all things under His feet.\"[fn-79-P7971_2269333:776-nf] Now, if from all these facts which are found in the Creator there is yet to be deduced[fn-79-P7972_2269440:777-nf] another god and another Christ, let us go in quest of the Creator. I suppose, forsooth,[fn-79-P7973_2269545:778-nf] we find Him, when he speaks of such as \"were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein they had walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, who worketh in the children of disobedience.\"[fn-79-P7974_2269792:779-nf] But Marcion must not here interpret the world as meaning the God of the world.[fn-79-P7975_2269893:780-nf] For a creature bears no resemblance to the Creator; the thing made, none to its Maker; the world, none to God. He, moreover, who is the Prince of the power of the ages must not be thought to be called the prince of the power of the air; for He who is chief over the higher powers derives no title from the lower powers, although these, too, may be ascribed to Him. Nor, again, can He possibly seem to be the instigator[fn-79-P7976_2270363:781-nf] of that unbelief which He Himself had rather to endure at the hand of the Jews and the Gentiles alike. We may therefore simply conclude that[fn-79-P7977_2270587:782-nf] these designations are unsuited to the Creator. There is another being to whom they are more applicable-and the apostle knew very well who that was. Who then is he? Undoubtedly he who has raised up \"children of disobedience\" against the Creator Himself ever since he took possession of that \"air\" of His; even as the prophet makes him say: \"I will set my throne above the stars; ... I will go up above the clouds; I will be like the Most High.\"[fn-79-P7978_2271057:783-nf] This must mean the devil, whom in another passage (since such will they there have the apostle's meaning to be) we shall recognize in the appellation the god of this world.[fn-79-P7979_2271297:784-nf] For he has filled the whole world with the lying pretence of his own divinity. To be sure,[fn-79-P7980_2271481:785-nf] if he had not existed, we might then possibly have applied these descriptions to the Creator. But the apostle, too, had lived in Judaism; and when he parenthetically observed of the sins (of that period of his life), \"in which also we all had our conversation in times past,\"[fn-79-P7981_2271798:786-nf] he must not be understood to indicate that the Creator was the lord of sinful men, and the prince of this air; but as meaning that in his Judaism he had been one of the children of disobedience, having the devil as his instigator-when he persecuted the church and the Christ of the Creator. Therefore he says: \"We also were the children of wrath,\" but \"by nature.\"[fn-79-P7982_2272182:787-nf] Let the heretic, however, not contend that, because the Creator called the Jews children, therefore the Creator is the lord of wrath.[fn-79-P7983_2272335:788-nf] For when (the apostle) says,\" We were by nature the children of wrath,\" inasmuch as the Jews were not the Creator's children by nature, but by the election of their fathers, he (must have) referred their being children of wrath to nature, and not to the Creator, adding this at lasts\" even as others,\"[fn-79-P7984_2272664:789-nf] who, of course, were not children of God. It is manifest that sins, and lusts of the flesh, and unbelief, and anger, are ascribed to the common nature of all mankind, the devil [however leading that nature astray,[fn-79-P7985_2272897:790-nf] which he has already infected with the implanted germ of sin. \"We,\" says he, \"are His workmanship, created in Christ.\"[fn-79-P7986_2273033:791-nf] It is one thing to make (as a workman), another thing to create. But he assigns both to One. Man is the workmanship of the Creator. He therefore who made man (at first), created him also in Christ. As touching the substance of nature, He \"made\" him; as touching the work of grace, He \"created\" him. Look also at what follows in connection with these words: \"Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which has the name of circumcision in the flesh made by the hand-that at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise,[fn-79-P7987_2273717:792-nf] having no hope, and without God in the world.\"[fn-79-P7988_2273817:793-nf] Now, without what God and without what Christ were these Gentiles? Surely, without Him to whom the commonwealth[fn-79-P7989_2273953:794-nf] of Israel belonged, and the covenants and the promise. \"But now in Christ,\" says he, \"ye who were sometimes far off are made nigh by His blood.\"[fn-79-P7990_2274153:795-nf] From whom were they far off before? From the privileges) whereof he speaks above, even tom the Christ of the Creator, from the commonwealth of Israel, from the covenants, from the hope of the promise, from God Himself. Since this is the case, the Gentiles are consequently now in Christ made nigh to these (blessings), from which they were once far off. But if we are in Christ brought so very nigh to the commonwealth of Israel, which comprises the religion of the divine Creator, and to the covenants and to the promise, yea to their very God Himself, it is quite ridiculous (to suppose that) the Christ of the other god has brought us to this proximity to the Creator from afar. The apostle had in mind that it had been predicted concerning the call of the Gentiles from their distant alienation in words like these: \"They who were far off from me have come to my righteousness.\"[fn-79-P7991_2275057:796-nf] For the Creator's righteousness no less than His peace was announced in Christ, as we have often shown already. Therefore he says: \"He is our peace, who hath made both one\"[fn-79-P7992_2275308:797-nf] -that is, the Jewish nation and the Gentile world. What is near, and what was far off now that \"the middle wall has been broken down\" of their \"enmity,\" (are made one) \"in His flesh.\"[fn-79-P7993_2275512:798-nf] But Marcion erased the pronoun His, that he might make the enmity refer to flesh, as if (the apostle spoke) of a carnal enmity, instead of the enmity which was a rival to Christ.[fn-79-P7994_2275711:799-nf] And thus you have (as I have said elsewhere) exhibited the stupidity of Pontus, rather than the adroitness of a Marrucinian,[fn-79-P7995_2275894:800-nf] for you here deny him flesh to whom in the verse above you allowed blood! Since, however, He has made the law obsolete[fn-79-P7996_2276098:801-nf] by His own precepts, even by Himself fulfilling the law (for superfluous is, \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" when He says, \"Thou shalt not look on a woman to lust after her; \"superfluous also is, \"Thou shalt do no murder,\" when He says, \"Thou shalt not speak evil of thy neighbour,\") it is impossible to make an adversary of the law out of one who so completely promotes it.[fn-79-P7997_2276496:802-nf] \"For to create[fn-79-P7998_2276531:803-nf] in Himself of twain,\" for He who had made is also the same who creates (just as we have found it stated above: \"For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus\"),[fn-79-P7999_2276788:804-nf] \"one new man, making peace\" (really new, and really man-no phantom-but new, and newly born of a virgin by the Spirit of God), \"that He might reconcile both unto God\"[fn-80-P8000_2276974:805-nf] (even the God whom both races had offended-both Jew and Gentile), \"in one body,\" says he, \"having in it slain the enmity by the cross.\"[fn-80-P8001_2277133:806-nf] Thus we find from this passage also, that there was in Christ a fleshly body, such as was able to endure the cross. \"When, therefore, He came and preached peace to them that were near and to them which were afar off,\" we both obtained \"access to the Father,\" being \"now no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God\" (even of Him from whom, as we have shown above, we were aliens, and placed far off), \"built upon the foundation of the apostles\"[fn-80-P8002_2277652:807-nf] -(the apostle added), \"and the prophets; \"these words, however, the heretic erased, forgetting that the Lord had set in His Church not only apostles, but prophets also. He feared, no doubt, that our building was to stand in Christ upon the foundation of the ancient prophets,[fn-80-P8003_2277951:808-nf] since the apostle himself never fails to build us up everywhere with (the words of) the prophets.

But of what consequence are the titles, since in writing to a certain church the apostle did in fact write to all? It is certain that, whoever they were to whom he wrote,[fn-79-P7954_2264997:759-nf] he declared Him to be God in Christ with whom all things agree which are predicted. Now, to what god will most suitably belong all those things which relate to \"that good pleasure, which God hath purposed in the mystery of His will, that in the dispensation of the fulness of times He might recapitulate\" (if I may so say, according to the exact meaning of the Greek word[fn-79-P7955_2265389:760-nf] ) \"all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth,\"[fn-79-P7956_2265517:761-nf] but to Him whose are all things from their beginning, yea the beginning itself too; from whom issue the times and the dispensation of the fulness of times, according to which all things up to the very first are gathered up in Christ? What beginning, however, has the other god; that is to say, how can anything proceed from him, who has no work to show? And if there be no beginning, how can there be times? If no times, what fulness of times can there be? And if no fulness, what dispensation? Indeed, what has he ever done on earth, that any long dispensation of times to be fulfilled can be put to his account, for the accomplishment of all things in Christ, even of things in heaven?

It is certain that, whoever they were to whom he wrote,[fn-79-P7954_2264997:759-nf] he declared Him to be God in Christ with whom all things agree which are predicted. Now, to what god will most suitably belong all those things which relate to \"that good pleasure, which God hath purposed in the mystery of His will, that in the dispensation of the fulness of times He might recapitulate\" (if I may so say, according to the exact meaning of the Greek word[fn-79-P7955_2265389:760-nf] ) \"all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth,\"[fn-79-P7956_2265517:761-nf] but to Him whose are all things from their beginning, yea the beginning itself too; from whom issue the times and the dispensation of the fulness of times, according to which all things up to the very first are gathered up in Christ? What beginning, however, has the other god; that is to say, how can anything proceed from him, who has no work to show? And if there be no beginning, how can there be times? If no times, what fulness of times can there be? And if no fulness, what dispensation? Indeed, what has he ever done on earth, that any long dispensation of times to be fulfilled can be put to his account, for the accomplishment of all things in Christ, even of things in heaven? Nor can we possibly suppose that any things whatever have been at any time done in heaven by any other God than Him by whom, as all men allow, all things have been done on earth. Now, if it is impossible for all these things from the beginning to be reckoned to any other God than the Creator, who will believe that an alien god has recapitulated them in an alien Christ, instead of their own proper Author in His own Christ? If, again, they belong to the Creator, they must needs be separate from the other god; and if separate, then opposed to him. But then how can opposites be gathered together into him by whom they are in short destroyed? Again, what Christ do the following words announce, when the apostle says: \"That we should be to the praise of His glory, who first trusted in Christ? \"[fn-79-P7957_2267025:762-nf] Now who could have first trusted-i.e. previously trusted[fn-79-P7958_2267101:763-nf] -in God, before His advent, except the Jews to whom Christ was previously announced, from the beginning? He who was thus foretold, was also foretrusted. Hence the apostle refers the statement to himself, that is, to the Jews, in order that he may draw a distinction with respect to the Gentiles, (when he goes on to say: ) \"In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel (of your salvation); in whom ye believed, and were sealed with His Holy Spirit of promise.\"[fn-79-P7959_2267644:764-nf] Of what promise? That which was made through Joel: \"In the last days will I pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh,\"[fn-79-P7960_2267778:765-nf] that is, on all nations. Therefore the Spirit and the Gospel will be found in the Christ, who was foretrusted, because foretold. Again, \"the Father of glory\"[fn-79-P7961_2267956:766-nf] is He whose Christ, when ascending to heaven, is celebrated as \"the King of Glory\" in the Psalm: \"Who is this King of Glory? the Lord of Hosts, He is the King of Glory.\"[fn-79-P7962_2268146:767-nf] From Him also is besought \"the spirit of wisdom,\"[fn-79-P7963_2268217:768-nf] at whose disposal is enumerated that sevenfold distribution of the spirit of grace by Isaiah.[fn-79-P7964_2268330:769-nf] He likewise will grant \"the enlightenment of the eyes of the understanding,\"[fn-79-P7965_2268426:770-nf] who has also enriched our natural eyes with light; to whom, moreover, the blindness of the people is offensive: \"And who is blind, but my servants? ... yea, the servants of God have become blind.\"[fn-79-P7966_2268640:771-nf] In His gift, too, are \"the riches (of the glory) of His inheritance in the saints,\"[fn-79-P7967_2268754:772-nf] who promised such an inheritance in the call of the Gentiles: \"Ask of me, and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance.\"[fn-79-P7968_2268904:773-nf] It was He who \"wrought in Christ His mighty power, by raising Him from the dead, and setting Him at His own right hand, and putting all things under His feet\"[fn-79-P7969_2269081:774-nf] -even the same who said: \"Sit Thou on my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\"[fn-79-P7970_2269199:775-nf] For in another passage the Spirit says to the Father concerning the Son: \"Thou hast put all things under His feet.\"[fn-79-P7971_2269333:776-nf] Now, if from all these facts which are found in the Creator there is yet to be deduced[fn-79-P7972_2269440:777-nf] another god and another Christ, let us go in quest of the Creator. I suppose, forsooth,[fn-79-P7973_2269545:778-nf] we find Him, when he speaks of such as \"were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein they had walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, who worketh in the children of disobedience.\"[fn-79-P7974_2269792:779-nf] But Marcion must not here interpret the world as meaning the God of the world.[fn-79-P7975_2269893:780-nf] For a creature bears no resemblance to the Creator; the thing made, none to its Maker; the world, none to God. He, moreover, who is the Prince of the power of the ages must not be thought to be called the prince of the power of the air; for He who is chief over the higher powers derives no title from the lower powers, although these, too, may be ascribed to Him. Nor, again, can He possibly seem to be the instigator[fn-79-P7976_2270363:781-nf] of that unbelief which He Himself had rather to endure at the hand of the Jews and the Gentiles alike. We may therefore simply conclude that[fn-79-P7977_2270587:782-nf] these designations are unsuited to the Creator. There is another being to whom they are more applicable-and the apostle knew very well who that was. Who then is he? Undoubtedly he who has raised up \"children of disobedience\" against the Creator Himself ever since he took possession of that \"air\" of His; even as the prophet makes him say: \"I will set my throne above the stars; ... I will go up above the clouds; I will be like the Most High.\"[fn-79-P7978_2271057:783-nf] This must mean the devil, whom in another passage (since such will they there have the apostle's meaning to be) we shall recognize in the appellation the god of this world.[fn-79-P7979_2271297:784-nf] For he has filled the whole world with the lying pretence of his own divinity. To be sure,[fn-79-P7980_2271481:785-nf] if he had not existed, we might then possibly have applied these descriptions to the Creator. But the apostle, too, had lived in Judaism; and when he parenthetically observed of the sins (of that period of his life), \"in which also we all had our conversation in times past,\"[fn-79-P7981_2271798:786-nf] he must not be understood to indicate that the Creator was the lord of sinful men, and the prince of this air; but as meaning that in his Judaism he had been one of the children of disobedience, having the devil as his instigator-when he persecuted the church and the Christ of the Creator. Therefore he says: \"We also were the children of wrath,\" but \"by nature.\"[fn-79-P7982_2272182:787-nf] Let the heretic, however, not contend that, because the Creator called the Jews children, therefore the Creator is the lord of wrath.[fn-79-P7983_2272335:788-nf] For when (the apostle) says,\" We were by nature the children of wrath,\" inasmuch as the Jews were not the Creator's children by nature, but by the election of their fathers, he (must have) referred their being children of wrath to nature, and not to the Creator, adding this at lasts\" even as others,\"[fn-79-P7984_2272664:789-nf] who, of course, were not children of God. It is manifest that sins, and lusts of the flesh, and unbelief, and anger, are ascribed to the common nature of all mankind, the devil [however leading that nature astray,[fn-79-P7985_2272897:790-nf] which he has already infected with the implanted germ of sin. \"We,\" says he, \"are His workmanship, created in Christ.\"[fn-79-P7986_2273033:791-nf] It is one thing to make (as a workman), another thing to create. But he assigns both to One. Man is the workmanship of the Creator. He therefore who made man (at first), created him also in Christ. As touching the substance of nature, He \"made\" him; as touching the work of grace, He \"created\" him. Look also at what follows in connection with these words: \"Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which has the name of circumcision in the flesh made by the hand-that at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise,[fn-79-P7987_2273717:792-nf] having no hope, and without God in the world.\"[fn-79-P7988_2273817:793-nf] Now, without what God and without what Christ were these Gentiles? Surely, without Him to whom the commonwealth[fn-79-P7989_2273953:794-nf] of Israel belonged, and the covenants and the promise. \"But now in Christ,\" says he, \"ye who were sometimes far off are made nigh by His blood.\"[fn-79-P7990_2274153:795-nf] From whom were they far off before? From the privileges) whereof he speaks above, even tom the Christ of the Creator, from the commonwealth of Israel, from the covenants, from the hope of the promise, from God Himself. Since this is the case, the Gentiles are consequently now in Christ made nigh to these (blessings), from which they were once far off. But if we are in Christ brought so very nigh to the commonwealth of Israel, which comprises the religion of the divine Creator, and to the covenants and to the promise, yea to their very God Himself, it is quite ridiculous (to suppose that) the Christ of the other god has brought us to this proximity to the Creator from afar. The apostle had in mind that it had been predicted concerning the call of the Gentiles from their distant alienation in words like these: \"They who were far off from me have come to my righteousness.\"[fn-79-P7991_2275057:796-nf] For the Creator's righteousness no less than His peace was announced in Christ, as we have often shown already. Therefore he says: \"He is our peace, who hath made both one\"[fn-79-P7992_2275308:797-nf] -that is, the Jewish nation and the Gentile world. What is near, and what was far off now that \"the middle wall has been broken down\" of their \"enmity,\" (are made one) \"in His flesh.\"[fn-79-P7993_2275512:798-nf] But Marcion erased the pronoun His, that he might make the enmity refer to flesh, as if (the apostle spoke) of a carnal enmity, instead of the enmity which was a rival to Christ.[fn-79-P7994_2275711:799-nf] And thus you have (as I have said elsewhere) exhibited the stupidity of Pontus, rather than the adroitness of a Marrucinian,[fn-79-P7995_2275894:800-nf] for you here deny him flesh to whom in the verse above you allowed blood! Since, however, He has made the law obsolete[fn-79-P7996_2276098:801-nf] by His own precepts, even by Himself fulfilling the law (for superfluous is, \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" when He says, \"Thou shalt not look on a woman to lust after her; \"superfluous also is, \"Thou shalt do no murder,\" when He says, \"Thou shalt not speak evil of thy neighbour,\") it is impossible to make an adversary of the law out of one who so completely promotes it.[fn-79-P7997_2276496:802-nf] \"For to create[fn-79-P7998_2276531:803-nf] in Himself of twain,\" for He who had made is also the same who creates (just as we have found it stated above: \"For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus\"),[fn-79-P7999_2276788:804-nf] \"one new man, making peace\" (really new, and really man-no phantom-but new, and newly born of a virgin by the Spirit of God), \"that He might reconcile both unto God\"[fn-80-P8000_2276974:805-nf] (even the God whom both races had offended-both Jew and Gentile), \"in one body,\" says he, \"having in it slain the enmity by the cross.\"[fn-80-P8001_2277133:806-nf] Thus we find from this passage also, that there was in Christ a fleshly body, such as was able to endure the cross. \"When, therefore, He came and preached peace to them that were near and to them which were afar off,\" we both obtained \"access to the Father,\" being \"now no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God\" (even of Him from whom, as we have shown above, we were aliens, and placed far off), \"built upon the foundation of the apostles\"[fn-80-P8002_2277652:807-nf] -(the apostle added), \"and the prophets; \"these words, however, the heretic erased, forgetting that the Lord had set in His Church not only apostles, but prophets also. He feared, no doubt, that our building was to stand in Christ upon the foundation of the ancient prophets,[fn-80-P8003_2277951:808-nf] since the apostle himself never fails to build us up everywhere with (the words of) the prophets. For whence did he learn to call Christ \"the chief corner-stone,\"[fn-80-P8004_2278282:809-nf] but from the figure given him in the Psalm: \"The stone which the builders rejected is become the head (stone) of the corner? \"[fn-80-P8005_2278429:810-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"62","folder":"ANF-03","text":"We have it on the true tradition[fn-79-P7952_2264515:757-nf] of the Church, that this epistle was sent to the Ephesians, not to the Laodiceans.

Since, however, He has made the law obsolete[fn-79-P7996_2276098:801-nf] by His own precepts, even by Himself fulfilling the law (for superfluous is, \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" when He says, \"Thou shalt not look on a woman to lust after her; \"superfluous also is, \"Thou shalt do no murder,\" when He says, \"Thou shalt not speak evil of thy neighbour,\") it is impossible to make an adversary of the law out of one who so completely promotes it.[fn-79-P7997_2276496:802-nf] \"For to create[fn-79-P7998_2276531:803-nf] in Himself of twain,\" for He who had made is also the same who creates (just as we have found it stated above: \"For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus\"),[fn-79-P7999_2276788:804-nf] \"one new man, making peace\" (really new, and really man-no phantom-but new, and newly born of a virgin by the Spirit of God), \"that He might reconcile both unto God\"[fn-80-P8000_2276974:805-nf] (even the God whom both races had offended-both Jew and Gentile), \"in one body,\" says he, \"having in it slain the enmity by the cross.\"[fn-80-P8001_2277133:806-nf] Thus we find from this passage also, that there was in Christ a fleshly body, such as was able to endure the cross. \"When, therefore, He came and preached peace to them that were near and to them which were afar off,\" we both obtained \"access to the Father,\" being \"now no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God\" (even of Him from whom, as we have shown above, we were aliens, and placed far off), \"built upon the foundation of the apostles\"[fn-80-P8002_2277652:807-nf] -(the apostle added), \"and the prophets; \"these words, however, the heretic erased, forgetting that the Lord had set in His Church not only apostles, but prophets also.

Marcion, however, was very desirous of giving it the new rifle (of Laodicean),[fn-79-P7953_2264695:758-nf] as if he were extremely accurate in investigating such a point. But of what consequence are the titles, since in writing to a certain church the apostle did in fact write to all? It is certain that, whoever they were to whom he wrote,[fn-79-P7954_2264997:759-nf] he declared Him to be God in Christ with whom all things agree which are predicted. Now, to what god will most suitably belong all those things which relate to \"that good pleasure, which God hath purposed in the mystery of His will, that in the dispensation of the fulness of times He might recapitulate\" (if I may so say, according to the exact meaning of the Greek word[fn-79-P7955_2265389:760-nf] ) \"all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth,\"[fn-79-P7956_2265517:761-nf] but to Him whose are all things from their beginning, yea the beginning itself too; from whom issue the times and the dispensation of the fulness of times, according to which all things up to the very first are gathered up in Christ? What beginning, however, has the other god; that is to say, how can anything proceed from him, who has no work to show? And if there be no beginning, how can there be times? If no times, what fulness of times can there be? And if no fulness, what dispensation? Indeed, what has he ever done on earth, that any long dispensation of times to be fulfilled can be put to his account, for the accomplishment of all things in Christ, even of things in heaven? Nor can we possibly suppose that any things whatever have been at any time done in heaven by any other God than Him by whom, as all men allow, all things have been done on earth. Now, if it is impossible for all these things from the beginning to be reckoned to any other God than the Creator, who will believe that an alien god has recapitulated them in an alien Christ, instead of their own proper Author in His own Christ? If, again, they belong to the Creator, they must needs be separate from the other god; and if separate, then opposed to him. But then how can opposites be gathered together into him by whom they are in short destroyed? Again, what Christ do the following words announce, when the apostle says: \"That we should be to the praise of His glory, who first trusted in Christ? \"[fn-79-P7957_2267025:762-nf] Now who could have first trusted-i.e. previously trusted[fn-79-P7958_2267101:763-nf] -in God, before His advent, except the Jews to whom Christ was previously announced, from the beginning? He who was thus foretold, was also foretrusted. Hence the apostle refers the statement to himself, that is, to the Jews, in order that he may draw a distinction with respect to the Gentiles, (when he goes on to say: ) \"In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel (of your salvation); in whom ye believed, and were sealed with His Holy Spirit of promise.\"[fn-79-P7959_2267644:764-nf] Of what promise? That which was made through Joel: \"In the last days will I pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh,\"[fn-79-P7960_2267778:765-nf] that is, on all nations. Therefore the Spirit and the Gospel will be found in the Christ, who was foretrusted, because foretold. Again, \"the Father of glory\"[fn-79-P7961_2267956:766-nf] is He whose Christ, when ascending to heaven, is celebrated as \"the King of Glory\" in the Psalm: \"Who is this King of Glory? the Lord of Hosts, He is the King of Glory.\"[fn-79-P7962_2268146:767-nf] From Him also is besought \"the spirit of wisdom,\"[fn-79-P7963_2268217:768-nf] at whose disposal is enumerated that sevenfold distribution of the spirit of grace by Isaiah.[fn-79-P7964_2268330:769-nf] He likewise will grant \"the enlightenment of the eyes of the understanding,\"[fn-79-P7965_2268426:770-nf] who has also enriched our natural eyes with light; to whom, moreover, the blindness of the people is offensive: \"And who is blind, but my servants? ... yea, the servants of God have become blind.\"[fn-79-P7966_2268640:771-nf] In His gift, too, are \"the riches (of the glory) of His inheritance in the saints,\"[fn-79-P7967_2268754:772-nf] who promised such an inheritance in the call of the Gentiles: \"Ask of me, and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance.\"[fn-79-P7968_2268904:773-nf] It was He who \"wrought in Christ His mighty power, by raising Him from the dead, and setting Him at His own right hand, and putting all things under His feet\"[fn-79-P7969_2269081:774-nf] -even the same who said: \"Sit Thou on my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\"[fn-79-P7970_2269199:775-nf] For in another passage the Spirit says to the Father concerning the Son: \"Thou hast put all things under His feet.\"[fn-79-P7971_2269333:776-nf] Now, if from all these facts which are found in the Creator there is yet to be deduced[fn-79-P7972_2269440:777-nf] another god and another Christ, let us go in quest of the Creator. I suppose, forsooth,[fn-79-P7973_2269545:778-nf] we find Him, when he speaks of such as \"were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein they had walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, who worketh in the children of disobedience.\"[fn-79-P7974_2269792:779-nf] But Marcion must not here interpret the world as meaning the God of the world.[fn-79-P7975_2269893:780-nf] For a creature bears no resemblance to the Creator; the thing made, none to its Maker; the world, none to God. He, moreover, who is the Prince of the power of the ages must not be thought to be called the prince of the power of the air; for He who is chief over the higher powers derives no title from the lower powers, although these, too, may be ascribed to Him. Nor, again, can He possibly seem to be the instigator[fn-79-P7976_2270363:781-nf] of that unbelief which He Himself had rather to endure at the hand of the Jews and the Gentiles alike. We may therefore simply conclude that[fn-79-P7977_2270587:782-nf] these designations are unsuited to the Creator. There is another being to whom they are more applicable-and the apostle knew very well who that was. Who then is he? Undoubtedly he who has raised up \"children of disobedience\" against the Creator Himself ever since he took possession of that \"air\" of His; even as the prophet makes him say: \"I will set my throne above the stars; ... I will go up above the clouds; I will be like the Most High.\"[fn-79-P7978_2271057:783-nf] This must mean the devil, whom in another passage (since such will they there have the apostle's meaning to be) we shall recognize in the appellation the god of this world.[fn-79-P7979_2271297:784-nf] For he has filled the whole world with the lying pretence of his own divinity. To be sure,[fn-79-P7980_2271481:785-nf] if he had not existed, we might then possibly have applied these descriptions to the Creator. But the apostle, too, had lived in Judaism; and when he parenthetically observed of the sins (of that period of his life), \"in which also we all had our conversation in times past,\"[fn-79-P7981_2271798:786-nf] he must not be understood to indicate that the Creator was the lord of sinful men, and the prince of this air; but as meaning that in his Judaism he had been one of the children of disobedience, having the devil as his instigator-when he persecuted the church and the Christ of the Creator. Therefore he says: \"We also were the children of wrath,\" but \"by nature.\"[fn-79-P7982_2272182:787-nf] Let the heretic, however, not contend that, because the Creator called the Jews children, therefore the Creator is the lord of wrath.[fn-79-P7983_2272335:788-nf] For when (the apostle) says,\" We were by nature the children of wrath,\" inasmuch as the Jews were not the Creator's children by nature, but by the election of their fathers, he (must have) referred their being children of wrath to nature, and not to the Creator, adding this at lasts\" even as others,\"[fn-79-P7984_2272664:789-nf] who, of course, were not children of God. It is manifest that sins, and lusts of the flesh, and unbelief, and anger, are ascribed to the common nature of all mankind, the devil [however leading that nature astray,[fn-79-P7985_2272897:790-nf] which he has already infected with the implanted germ of sin. \"We,\" says he, \"are His workmanship, created in Christ.\"[fn-79-P7986_2273033:791-nf] It is one thing to make (as a workman), another thing to create. But he assigns both to One. Man is the workmanship of the Creator. He therefore who made man (at first), created him also in Christ. As touching the substance of nature, He \"made\" him; as touching the work of grace, He \"created\" him. Look also at what follows in connection with these words: \"Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which has the name of circumcision in the flesh made by the hand-that at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise,[fn-79-P7987_2273717:792-nf] having no hope, and without God in the world.\"[fn-79-P7988_2273817:793-nf] Now, without what God and without what Christ were these Gentiles? Surely, without Him to whom the commonwealth[fn-79-P7989_2273953:794-nf] of Israel belonged, and the covenants and the promise. \"But now in Christ,\" says he, \"ye who were sometimes far off are made nigh by His blood.\"[fn-79-P7990_2274153:795-nf] From whom were they far off before? From the privileges) whereof he speaks above, even tom the Christ of the Creator, from the commonwealth of Israel, from the covenants, from the hope of the promise, from God Himself. Since this is the case, the Gentiles are consequently now in Christ made nigh to these (blessings), from which they were once far off. But if we are in Christ brought so very nigh to the commonwealth of Israel, which comprises the religion of the divine Creator, and to the covenants and to the promise, yea to their very God Himself, it is quite ridiculous (to suppose that) the Christ of the other god has brought us to this proximity to the Creator from afar. The apostle had in mind that it had been predicted concerning the call of the Gentiles from their distant alienation in words like these: \"They who were far off from me have come to my righteousness.\"[fn-79-P7991_2275057:796-nf] For the Creator's righteousness no less than His peace was announced in Christ, as we have often shown already. Therefore he says: \"He is our peace, who hath made both one\"[fn-79-P7992_2275308:797-nf] -that is, the Jewish nation and the Gentile world. What is near, and what was far off now that \"the middle wall has been broken down\" of their \"enmity,\" (are made one) \"in His flesh.\"[fn-79-P7993_2275512:798-nf] But Marcion erased the pronoun His, that he might make the enmity refer to flesh, as if (the apostle spoke) of a carnal enmity, instead of the enmity which was a rival to Christ.[fn-79-P7994_2275711:799-nf] And thus you have (as I have said elsewhere) exhibited the stupidity of Pontus, rather than the adroitness of a Marrucinian,[fn-79-P7995_2275894:800-nf] for you here deny him flesh to whom in the verse above you allowed blood!

Surely, without Him to whom the commonwealth[fn-79-P7989_2273953:794-nf] of Israel belonged, and the covenants and the promise. \"But now in Christ,\" says he, \"ye who were sometimes far off are made nigh by His blood.\"[fn-79-P7990_2274153:795-nf] From whom were they far off before? From the privileges) whereof he speaks above, even tom the Christ of the Creator, from the commonwealth of Israel, from the covenants, from the hope of the promise, from God Himself. Since this is the case, the Gentiles are consequently now in Christ made nigh to these (blessings), from which they were once far off. But if we are in Christ brought so very nigh to the commonwealth of Israel, which comprises the religion of the divine Creator, and to the covenants and to the promise, yea to their very God Himself, it is quite ridiculous (to suppose that) the Christ of the other god has brought us to this proximity to the Creator from afar. The apostle had in mind that it had been predicted concerning the call of the Gentiles from their distant alienation in words like these: \"They who were far off from me have come to my righteousness.\"[fn-79-P7991_2275057:796-nf] For the Creator's righteousness no less than His peace was announced in Christ, as we have often shown already. Therefore he says: \"He is our peace, who hath made both one\"[fn-79-P7992_2275308:797-nf] -that is, the Jewish nation and the Gentile world. What is near, and what was far off now that \"the middle wall has been broken down\" of their \"enmity,\" (are made one) \"in His flesh.\"[fn-79-P7993_2275512:798-nf] But Marcion erased the pronoun His, that he might make the enmity refer to flesh, as if (the apostle spoke) of a carnal enmity, instead of the enmity which was a rival to Christ.[fn-79-P7994_2275711:799-nf] And thus you have (as I have said elsewhere) exhibited the stupidity of Pontus, rather than the adroitness of a Marrucinian,[fn-79-P7995_2275894:800-nf] for you here deny him flesh to whom in the verse above you allowed blood! Since, however, He has made the law obsolete[fn-79-P7996_2276098:801-nf] by His own precepts, even by Himself fulfilling the law (for superfluous is, \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" when He says, \"Thou shalt not look on a woman to lust after her; \"superfluous also is, \"Thou shalt do no murder,\" when He says, \"Thou shalt not speak evil of thy neighbour,\") it is impossible to make an adversary of the law out of one who so completely promotes it.[fn-79-P7997_2276496:802-nf] \"For to create[fn-79-P7998_2276531:803-nf] in Himself of twain,\" for He who had made is also the same who creates (just as we have found it stated above: \"For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus\"),[fn-79-P7999_2276788:804-nf] \"one new man, making peace\" (really new, and really man-no phantom-but new, and newly born of a virgin by the Spirit of God), \"that He might reconcile both unto God\"[fn-80-P8000_2276974:805-nf] (even the God whom both races had offended-both Jew and Gentile), \"in one body,\" says he, \"having in it slain the enmity by the cross.\"[fn-80-P8001_2277133:806-nf] Thus we find from this passage also, that there was in Christ a fleshly body, such as was able to endure the cross. \"When, therefore, He came and preached peace to them that were near and to them which were afar off,\" we both obtained \"access to the Father,\" being \"now no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God\" (even of Him from whom, as we have shown above, we were aliens, and placed far off), \"built upon the foundation of the apostles\"[fn-80-P8002_2277652:807-nf] -(the apostle added), \"and the prophets; \"these words, however, the heretic erased, forgetting that the Lord had set in His Church not only apostles, but prophets also. He feared, no doubt, that our building was to stand in Christ upon the foundation of the ancient prophets,[fn-80-P8003_2277951:808-nf] since the apostle himself never fails to build us up everywhere with (the words of) the prophets. For whence did he learn to call Christ \"the chief corner-stone,\"[fn-80-P8004_2278282:809-nf] but from the figure given him in the Psalm: \"The stone which the builders rejected is become the head (stone) of the corner? \"[fn-80-P8005_2278429:810-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":20,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"62","folder":"ANF-03","text":"We have it on the true tradition[fn-79-P7952_2264515:757-nf] of the Church, that this epistle was sent to the Ephesians, not to the Laodiceans. Marcion, however, was very desirous of giving it the new rifle (of Laodicean),[fn-79-P7953_2264695:758-nf] as if he were extremely accurate in investigating such a point. But of what consequence are the titles, since in writing to a certain church the apostle did in fact write to all? It is certain that, whoever they were to whom he wrote,[fn-79-P7954_2264997:759-nf] he declared Him to be God in Christ with whom all things agree which are predicted. Now, to what god will most suitably belong all those things which relate to \"that good pleasure, which God hath purposed in the mystery of His will, that in the dispensation of the fulness of times He might recapitulate\" (if I may so say, according to the exact meaning of the Greek word[fn-79-P7955_2265389:760-nf] ) \"all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth,\"[fn-79-P7956_2265517:761-nf] but to Him whose are all things from their beginning, yea the beginning itself too; from whom issue the times and the dispensation of the fulness of times, according to which all things up to the very first are gathered up in Christ? What beginning, however, has the other god; that is to say, how can anything proceed from him, who has no work to show? And if there be no beginning, how can there be times? If no times, what fulness of times can there be? And if no fulness, what dispensation? Indeed, what has he ever done on earth, that any long dispensation of times to be fulfilled can be put to his account, for the accomplishment of all things in Christ, even of things in heaven? Nor can we possibly suppose that any things whatever have been at any time done in heaven by any other God than Him by whom, as all men allow, all things have been done on earth. Now, if it is impossible for all these things from the beginning to be reckoned to any other God than the Creator, who will believe that an alien god has recapitulated them in an alien Christ, instead of their own proper Author in His own Christ? If, again, they belong to the Creator, they must needs be separate from the other god; and if separate, then opposed to him. But then how can opposites be gathered together into him by whom they are in short destroyed? Again, what Christ do the following words announce, when the apostle says: \"That we should be to the praise of His glory, who first trusted in Christ? \"[fn-79-P7957_2267025:762-nf] Now who could have first trusted-i.e. previously trusted[fn-79-P7958_2267101:763-nf] -in God, before His advent, except the Jews to whom Christ was previously announced, from the beginning? He who was thus foretold, was also foretrusted. Hence the apostle refers the statement to himself, that is, to the Jews, in order that he may draw a distinction with respect to the Gentiles, (when he goes on to say: ) \"In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel (of your salvation); in whom ye believed, and were sealed with His Holy Spirit of promise.\"[fn-79-P7959_2267644:764-nf] Of what promise? That which was made through Joel: \"In the last days will I pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh,\"[fn-79-P7960_2267778:765-nf] that is, on all nations. Therefore the Spirit and the Gospel will be found in the Christ, who was foretrusted, because foretold. Again, \"the Father of glory\"[fn-79-P7961_2267956:766-nf] is He whose Christ, when ascending to heaven, is celebrated as \"the King of Glory\" in the Psalm: \"Who is this King of Glory? the Lord of Hosts, He is the King of Glory.\"[fn-79-P7962_2268146:767-nf] From Him also is besought \"the spirit of wisdom,\"[fn-79-P7963_2268217:768-nf] at whose disposal is enumerated that sevenfold distribution of the spirit of grace by Isaiah.[fn-79-P7964_2268330:769-nf] He likewise will grant \"the enlightenment of the eyes of the understanding,\"[fn-79-P7965_2268426:770-nf] who has also enriched our natural eyes with light; to whom, moreover, the blindness of the people is offensive: \"And who is blind, but my servants? ... yea, the servants of God have become blind.\"[fn-79-P7966_2268640:771-nf] In His gift, too, are \"the riches (of the glory) of His inheritance in the saints,\"[fn-79-P7967_2268754:772-nf] who promised such an inheritance in the call of the Gentiles: \"Ask of me, and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance.\"[fn-79-P7968_2268904:773-nf] It was He who \"wrought in Christ His mighty power, by raising Him from the dead, and setting Him at His own right hand, and putting all things under His feet\"[fn-79-P7969_2269081:774-nf] -even the same who said: \"Sit Thou on my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\"[fn-79-P7970_2269199:775-nf] For in another passage the Spirit says to the Father concerning the Son: \"Thou hast put all things under His feet.\"[fn-79-P7971_2269333:776-nf] Now, if from all these facts which are found in the Creator there is yet to be deduced[fn-79-P7972_2269440:777-nf] another god and another Christ, let us go in quest of the Creator. I suppose, forsooth,[fn-79-P7973_2269545:778-nf] we find Him, when he speaks of such as \"were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein they had walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, who worketh in the children of disobedience.\"[fn-79-P7974_2269792:779-nf] But Marcion must not here interpret the world as meaning the God of the world.[fn-79-P7975_2269893:780-nf] For a creature bears no resemblance to the Creator; the thing made, none to its Maker; the world, none to God. He, moreover, who is the Prince of the power of the ages must not be thought to be called the prince of the power of the air; for He who is chief over the higher powers derives no title from the lower powers, although these, too, may be ascribed to Him. Nor, again, can He possibly seem to be the instigator[fn-79-P7976_2270363:781-nf] of that unbelief which He Himself had rather to endure at the hand of the Jews and the Gentiles alike. We may therefore simply conclude that[fn-79-P7977_2270587:782-nf] these designations are unsuited to the Creator. There is another being to whom they are more applicable-and the apostle knew very well who that was. Who then is he? Undoubtedly he who has raised up \"children of disobedience\" against the Creator Himself ever since he took possession of that \"air\" of His; even as the prophet makes him say: \"I will set my throne above the stars; ... I will go up above the clouds; I will be like the Most High.\"[fn-79-P7978_2271057:783-nf] This must mean the devil, whom in another passage (since such will they there have the apostle's meaning to be) we shall recognize in the appellation the god of this world.[fn-79-P7979_2271297:784-nf] For he has filled the whole world with the lying pretence of his own divinity. To be sure,[fn-79-P7980_2271481:785-nf] if he had not existed, we might then possibly have applied these descriptions to the Creator. But the apostle, too, had lived in Judaism; and when he parenthetically observed of the sins (of that period of his life), \"in which also we all had our conversation in times past,\"[fn-79-P7981_2271798:786-nf] he must not be understood to indicate that the Creator was the lord of sinful men, and the prince of this air; but as meaning that in his Judaism he had been one of the children of disobedience, having the devil as his instigator-when he persecuted the church and the Christ of the Creator. Therefore he says: \"We also were the children of wrath,\" but \"by nature.\"[fn-79-P7982_2272182:787-nf] Let the heretic, however, not contend that, because the Creator called the Jews children, therefore the Creator is the lord of wrath.[fn-79-P7983_2272335:788-nf] For when (the apostle) says,\" We were by nature the children of wrath,\" inasmuch as the Jews were not the Creator's children by nature, but by the election of their fathers, he (must have) referred their being children of wrath to nature, and not to the Creator, adding this at lasts\" even as others,\"[fn-79-P7984_2272664:789-nf] who, of course, were not children of God. It is manifest that sins, and lusts of the flesh, and unbelief, and anger, are ascribed to the common nature of all mankind, the devil [however leading that nature astray,[fn-79-P7985_2272897:790-nf] which he has already infected with the implanted germ of sin. \"We,\" says he, \"are His workmanship, created in Christ.\"[fn-79-P7986_2273033:791-nf] It is one thing to make (as a workman), another thing to create. But he assigns both to One. Man is the workmanship of the Creator. He therefore who made man (at first), created him also in Christ. As touching the substance of nature, He \"made\" him; as touching the work of grace, He \"created\" him. Look also at what follows in connection with these words: \"Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which has the name of circumcision in the flesh made by the hand-that at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise,[fn-79-P7987_2273717:792-nf] having no hope, and without God in the world.\"[fn-79-P7988_2273817:793-nf] Now, without what God and without what Christ were these Gentiles? Surely, without Him to whom the commonwealth[fn-79-P7989_2273953:794-nf] of Israel belonged, and the covenants and the promise. \"But now in Christ,\" says he, \"ye who were sometimes far off are made nigh by His blood.\"[fn-79-P7990_2274153:795-nf] From whom were they far off before? From the privileges) whereof he speaks above, even tom the Christ of the Creator, from the commonwealth of Israel, from the covenants, from the hope of the promise, from God Himself.

If it is supposed that God could not enjoin warfare, because in after times it was said by the Lord Jesus Christ, \"I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but if any one strike thee on the right cheek, turn to him the left also,\"[fn-22-P2225_1338094:131-nf] the answer is, that what is here required is not a bodily action, but an inward disposition. The sacred seat of virtue is the heart, and such were the hearts of our fathers, the righteous men of old. But order required such a regulation of events, and such a distinction of times, as to show first of all that even earthly blessings (for so temporal kingdoms and victory over enemies are considered to be, and these are the things which the community of the ungodly all over the world are continually begging from idols and devils) are entirely under the control and at the disposal of the one true God. Thus, under the Old Testament, the secret of the kingdom of heaven, which was to be disclosed in due time, was veiled, and so far obscured, in the disguise of earthly promises. But when the fullness of time came for the revelation of the New Testament, which was hidden under the types of the Old, clear testimony was to be borne to the truth, that there is another life for which this life ought to be disregarded, and another kingdom for which the opposition of all earthly kingdoms should be patiently borne. Thus the name martyrs, which means witnesses, was given to those who, by the will of God, bore this testimony, by their confessions, their sufferings, and their death. The number of such witnesses is so great, that if it pleased Christ-who called Saul by a voice from heaven, and having changed him from a wolf to a sheep, sent him into the midst of wolves-to unite them all in one army, and to give them success in battle, as He gave to the Hebrews, what nation could withstand them? what kingdom would remain unsubdued? But as the doctrine of the New Testament is, that we must serve God not for temporal happiness in this life, but for eternal felicity hereafter, this truth was most strikingly confirmed by the patient endurance of what is commonly called adversity for the sake of that felicity. So in fullness of time the Son of God, made of a woman, made under the law, that He might redeem them that were under the law, made of the seed of David according to the flesh sends His disciples as sheep into the midst of wolves, and bids them not fear those that can kill the body, but cannot kill the soul, and promises that even the body will be entirely restored, so that not a hair shall be lost.[fn-22-P2226_1340435:132-nf] Peter's sword He orders back into its sheath, restoring as it was before the ear of His enemy that had been cut off. He says that He could obtain legions of angels to destroy His enemies, but that He must drink the cup which His Father's will had given Him.[fn-22-P2227_1340721:133-nf] He sets the example of drinking this cup, then hands it to His followers, manifesting thus, both in word and deed, the grace of patience. Therefore God raised Him from the dead, and has given Him a name which is above every name; that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and of things in earth, and of things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.[fn-22-P2228_1341226:134-nf] The patriarchs and prophets, then, have a kingdom in this world, to show that these kingdoms, too, are given and taken away by God: the apostles and martyrs had no kingdom here, to show the superior desirableness of the kingdom of heaven. The prophets, however, could even in those times die for the truth, as the Lord Himself says, \"From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zacharia;[fn-22-P2229_1341632:135-nf] and in these days, since the commencement of the fulfillment of what is prophesied in the psalm of Christ, under the figure of Solomon, which means the peacemaker, as Christ is our peace,[fn-22-P2230_1341844:136-nf] \"All kings of the earth shall bow to Him, all nations shall serve Him,\"[fn-22-P2231_1341936:137-nf] we have seen Christian emperors, who have put all their confidence in Christ, gaining splendid victories over ungodly enemies, whose hope was in the rites of idolatry and devil-worship. There are public and undeniable proofs of the fact, that on one side the prognostications of devils were found to be fallacious, and on the other, the predictions of saints were a means of support; and we have now writings in which those facts are recorded.","title":"Book XXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_35_book_xxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"91","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"89. As regards the prophet Hosea, it is unnecessary for me to explain the meaning of the command, or of the prophet's conduct, when God said to him, \"Go and take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and produce children of whoredoms,\" for the Scripture itself informs us of the origin and purpose of this direction. It proceeds thus: \"For the land hath committed great whoredom, departing from the Lord. So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son. And the Lord said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Judah, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel. And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel. And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said unto him, Call her name No-mercy: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away. But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the Lord their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen. Now when she had weaned No-mercy, she conceived, and bare a son. Then said God, Call his name Not-my-people: for ye are not my people, and I will not be your God. Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured for multitude; and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God. Then shall the children of Israel and the children of Judah be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel. Say ye unto your brethren, My people; and to your sister, She hath found mercy.\"[fn-22-P2281_1375111:174-nf] Since the typical meaning of the command and of the prophet's conduct is thus explained in the same book by the Lord Himself, and since the writings of the apostles declare the fulfillment of this prophecy in the preaching of the New Testament, every one must accept the explanation thus given of the command and of the action of the prophet as the true explanation. Thus it is said by the Apostle Paul, \"That He might make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, which He had afore prepared unto glory, even us, whom He hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles. As He saith also in Hosea, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved. And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there shall they be called the children of the living God.\"[fn-22-P2282_1376010:175-nf] Here Paul applies the prophecy to the Gentiles. So also Peter, writing to the Gentiles, without naming the prophet, borrows his expressions when he says, \"But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye might show forth the praises of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvellous light; which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.\"[fn-22-P2283_1376509:176-nf] From this it is plain that the words of the prophet, \"And the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured for multitude,\" and the words immediately following, \"And it shall be that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there they shall be called the children of the living God,\" do not apply to that Israel which is after the flesh, but to that of which the apostle says to the Gentiles, \"Ye therefore are the seed of Abraham, and heirs according to the promise.\"[fn-22-P2284_1377071:177-nf] But, as many Jews who were of the Israel after the flesh have believed, and will yet believe; for of these were the apostles, and all the thousands in Jerusalem of the company of the apostles, as also the churches of which Paul speaks, when he says to the Galatians, \"I was unknown by face to the churches of Judaea which were in Christ;\"[fn-22-P2285_1377431:178-nf] and again, he explains the passage in the Psalms, where the Lord is called the cornerstone,[fn-22-P2286_1377542:179-nf] as referring to His uniting in Himself the two walls of circumcision and uncircumcision, \"that He might make in Himself of twain one new man, so making peace; and that He might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby: and that He might come and preach peace to them that are far off, and to them that are nigh,\" that is, to the Gentiles and to the Jews; \"for He is our peace, who hath made of both one;\"[fn-22-P2287_1378011:180-nf] to the same purpose we find the prophet speaking of the Jews as the children of Judah, and of the Gentiles as children of Israel, where he says, \"The children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together, and shall make to themselves one head, and shall go up from the land.\" Therefore, to speak against a prophecy thus confirmed by actual events, is to speak against the writings of the apostles as well as those of the prophets; and not only to speak against writings, but to impugn in the most reckless manner the evidence clear as noonday of established facts. In the case of the narrative of Judah, it is perhaps not so easy to recognize, under the disguise of the woman called Tamar, the harlot representing the Church gathered from among the corruption of Gentile superstition; but here, where Scripture explains itself, and where the explanation is confirmed by the writings of the apostles, instead of dwelling longer on this, we may proceed at once to inquire into the meaning of the very things to which Faustus objects in Moses the servant of God.","title":"Book XXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_31_on_virginity","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"38","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But we need no lodger show in this narrow way the drawback of this life, as if the number of its ills was limited to adulteries, dissensions, and plots. I think we should take the higher and truer view, and say at once that none of that evil in life, which is visible in all its business and in all its pursuits, can have any hold over a man, if he will not put himself in the fetters of this course. The truth of what we say will be clear thus. A man who, seeing through the illusion with the eye of his spirit purged, lifts himself above the struggling world, and, to use the words of the Apostle, slights it all as but dung, in a way exiling himself altogether from human life by his abstinence from marriage,-that man has no fellowship whatever with the sins of mankind, such as avarice, envy, anger, hatred, and everything of the kind. He has an exemption from all this, and is in every way free and at peace; there is nothing in him to provoke his neighbours' envy, because he clutches none of those objects round which envy in this life gathers. He has raised his own life above the world, and prizing virtue as his only precious possession he will pass his days in painless peace and quiet. For virtue is a possession which, though all according to their capacity should share it, yet will be always in abundance for those who thirst after it; unlike the occupation of the lands on this earth, which men divide into sections, and the more they add to the one the more they take from the other, so that the one person's gain is his fellow's loss; whence arise the fights for the lion's share, from men's hatred of being cheated. But the larger owner of this possession is never envied; he who snatches the lion's share does no damage to him who claims equal participation; as each is capable each has this noble longing satisfied, while the wealth of virtues in those who are already occupiers[fn-26-P2676_1829327:17-nf] is not exhausted. The man, then, who, with his eyes only on such a life, makes virtue, which has no limit that man can devise, his only treasure, will surely never brook to bend his soul to any of those low courses which multitudes tread. He will not admire earthly riches, or human power, or any of those things which folly seeks. If, indeed, his mind is still pitched so low, he is outside our band of novices, and our words do not apply to him. But if his thoughts are above, walking as it were with God, he will be lifted out of the maze of all these errors; for the predisposing cause of them all, marriage, has not touched him. Now the wish to be before others is the deadly sin of pride, and one would not be far wrong in saying that this is the seed-root of all the thorns of sin; but it is from reasons connected with marriage that this pride mostly begins. To show what I mean, we generally find the grasping man throwing the blame on his nearest kin; the man mad after notoriety and ambition generally makes his family responsible for this sin: \"he must not be thought inferior to his forefathers; he must be deemed a great man by the generation to come by leaving his children historic records of himself\": so also the other maladies of the soul, envy, spite, hatred and such-like, are connected with this cause; they are to be found amongst those who are eager about the things of this life. He who has fled from it gazes as from some high watch-tower on the prospect of humanity, and pities these slaves of vanity for their blindness in setting such a value on bodily well-being. He sees some distinguished person giving himself airs because of his public honours, and wealth, and power, and only laughs at the folly of being so puffed up. He gives to the years of human life the longest number, according to the Psalmist's computation, and then compares this atom-interval with the endless ages, and pities the vain glory of those who excite themselves for such low and petty and perishable things. What, indeed, amongst the things here is there enviable in that which so many strive for,-honour? What is gained by those who win it? The mortal remains mortal whether he is honoured or not. What good does the possessor of many acres gain in the end? Except that the foolish man thinks his own that which never belongs to him, ignorant seemingly in his greed that \"the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof[fn-26-P2677_1831903:18-nf] ,\" for \"God is king of all the earth[fn-26-P2678_1831972:19-nf] .\" It is the passion of having which gives men a false title of lordship over that which can never belong to them. \"The earth,\" says the wise Preacher, \"abideth for ever[fn-26-P2679_1832174:20-nf] ,\" ministering to every generation, first one, then another, that is born upon it; but men, though they are so little even their own masters, that they are brought into life without knowing it by their Maker's will, and before they wish are withdrawn from it, nevertheless in their excessive vanity think that they are her lords; that they, now born, now dying, rule that which remains continually. One who reflecting on this holds cheaply all that mankind prizes, whose only love is the divine life, because \"all flesh is grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass[fn-26-P2680_1832771:21-nf] ,\" can never care for this grass which \"to-day is and to-morrow is not\"; studying the divine ways, he knows not only that human life has no fixity, but that the entire universe will not keep on its quiet course for ever; he neglects his existence here as an alien and a passing thing; for the Saviour said, \"Heaven and earth shall pass away[fn-26-P2681_1833131:22-nf] ,\" the whole of necessity awaits its refashioning. As long as he is \"in this tabernacle[fn-26-P2682_1833243:23-nf] .\" exhibiting mortality, weighed down with this existence, he laments the lengthening of his sojourn in it; as the Psalmist-poet says in his heavenly songs. Truly, they live in darkness who sojourn in these living tabernacles; wherefore that preacher, groaning at the continuance of this sojourn, says, \"Woe is me that my sojourn is prolonged[fn-26-P2683_1833604:24-nf] ,\" and he attributes the cause of his dejection to \"darkness\"; for we know that darkness is called in the Hebrew language \"kedar.\" It is indeed a darkness as of the night which envelops mankind, and prevents them seeing this deceit and knowing that all which is most prized by the living, and moreover all which is the reverse, exists only in the conception of the unreflecting, and is in itself nothing; there is no such reality anywhere as obscurity of birth, or illustrious birth, or glory, or splendour, or ancient renown, or present elevation, or power over others, or subjection. Wealth and comfort, poverty and distress, and all the other inequalities of life, seem to the ignorant, applying the test of pleasure, vastly different from each other. But to the higher understanding they are all alike; one is not of greater value than the other; because life runs on to the finish with the same speed through all these opposites, and in the lots of either class there remains the same power of choice to live well or ill, \"through armour on the right hand and on the left, through evil report and good report[fn-26-P2684_1834749:25-nf] .\" Therefore the clearseeing mind which measures reality will journey on its path without turning, accomplishing its appointed time from its birth to its exit; it is neither softened by the pleasures nor beaten down by the hardships; but, as is the way with travellers, it keeps advancing always, and takes but little notice of the views presented. It is the travellers way to press on to their journey's end, no matter whether they are passing through meadows and cultivated farms, or through wilder and more rugged spots; a smiling landscape does not detain them; nor a gloomy one check their speed. So, too, that lofty mind will press straight on to its self-imposed end, not turning aside to see anything on the way. It passes through life, but its gaze is fixed on heaven; it is the good steersman directing the bark to some landmark there. But the grosser mind looks down; it bends its energies to bodily pleasures as surely as the sheep stoop to their pasture; it lives for gorging and still lower pleasures[fn-26-P2685_1835784:26-nf] ; it is alienated from the life of God[fn-26-P2686_1836001:27-nf] , and a stranger to the promise of the Covenants; it recognizes no good but the gratification of the body. It is a mind such as this that \"walks in darkness[fn-26-P2687_1836188:28-nf] ,\" and invents all the evil in this life of ours; avarice, passions unchecked, unbounded luxury, lust of power, vain-glory, the whole mob of moral diseases that invade men's homes. In these vices, one somehow holds closely to another; where one has entered all the rest seem to follow, dragging each other in a natural order, just as in a chain, when you have jerked the first link, the others cannot rest, and even the link at the other end feels the motion of the first, which passes thence by virtue of their contiguity through the intervening links; so firmly are men's vices linked together by their very nature; when one of them has gained the mastery of a soul, the rest of the train follow. If you want a graphic picture of this accursed chain, suppose a man who because of some special pleasure it gives him is a victim to his thirst for fame; then a desire to increase his fortune follows close upon this thirst for fame; he becomes grasping; but only because the first vice leads him on to this. Then this grasping after money and superiority engenders either anger with his kith and kin, or pride towards his inferiors, or envy of those above him; then hypocrisy comes in after this envy; a soured temper after that; a misanthropical spirit after that; and behind them all a state of condemnation which ends in the dark fires of hell. You see the chain; how all follows from one cherished passion. Seeing, then, that this inseparable train of moral diseases has entered once for all into the world, one single way of escape is pointed out to us in the exhortations of the inspired writings; and that is to separate ourselves from the life which involves this sequence of sufferings. If we haunt Sodom, we cannot escape the rain of fire; nor if one who has fled out of her looks back upon her desolation, can he fail to become a pillar of salt rooted to the spot. We cannot be rid of the Egyptian bondage, unless we leave Egypt, that is, this life that lies under water[fn-26-P2688_1838191:29-nf] , and pass, not that Red Sea, but this black and gloomy Sea of life. But suppose we remain in this evil bondage, and, to use the Master's words, \"the truth shall not have made us free,\" how can one who seeks a lie and wanders in the maze of this world ever come to the truth? How can one who has surrendered his existence to be chained by nature run away from this captivity? An illustration will make our meaning clearer. A winter torrent[fn-26-P2689_1838684:30-nf] , which, impetuous in itself, becomes swollen and carries down beneath its stream trees and boulders and anything that comes in its way, is death and danger to those alone who live along its course; for those who have got well out of its way it rages in vain. Just so, only the man who lives in the turmoil of life has to feel its force; only he has to receive those sufferings which nature's stream, descending in a flood of troubles, must, to be true to its kind, bring to those who journey on its banks. But if a man leaves this torrent, and these \"proud waters[fn-26-P2690_1839268:31-nf] ,\" he will escape from being \"a prey to the teeth\" of this life, as the Psalm goes on to say, and, as \"a bird from the snare,\" on virtue's wings. This simile, then, of the torrent holds; human life is a tossing and tumultuous stream sweeping down to find its natural level; none of the objects sought for in it last till the seekers are satisfied; all that is carried to them by this stream comes near, just touches them, and passes on; so that the present moment in this impetuous flow eludes enjoyment, for the after-current snatches it from their view. It would be our interest therefore to keep far away from such a stream, lest, engaged on temporal things, we should neglect eternity. How can a man keep for ever anything here, be his love for it never so passionate? Which of life's most cherished objects endures always? What flower of prime? What gift of strength and beauty? What wealth, or fame, or power? They all have their transient bloom, and then melt away into their opposites. Who can continue in life's prime? Whose strength lasts for ever? Has not Nature made the bloom of beauty even more shortlived than the shows of spring? For they blossom in their season, and after withering for a while again revive; after another shedding they are again in leaf, and retain their beauty of to-day to a late prime. But Nature exhibits the human bloom only in the spring of early life; then she kills it; it is vanished in the frosts of age. All other delights also deceive the bodily eye for a time, and then pass behind the veil of oblivion. Nature's inevitable changes are many; they agonize him whose love is passionate. One way of escape is open: it is, to be attached to none of these things, and to get as far away as possible from the society of this emotional and sensual world; or rather, for a man to go outside the feelings which his own body gives rise to. Then, as he does not live for the flesh, he will not be subject to the troubles of the flesh. But this amounts to living for the spirit only, and imitating all we can the employment of the world of spirits. There they neither marry, nor are given in marriage. Their work and their excellence is to contemplate the Father of all purity, and to beautify the lines of their own character from the Source of all beauty, so far as imitation of It is possible.","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":2,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_31_on_virginity","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"38","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But we need no lodger show in this narrow way the drawback of this life, as if the number of its ills was limited to adulteries, dissensions, and plots.

In these vices, one somehow holds closely to another; where one has entered all the rest seem to follow, dragging each other in a natural order, just as in a chain, when you have jerked the first link, the others cannot rest, and even the link at the other end feels the motion of the first, which passes thence by virtue of their contiguity through the intervening links; so firmly are men's vices linked together by their very nature; when one of them has gained the mastery of a soul, the rest of the train follow. If you want a graphic picture of this accursed chain, suppose a man who because of some special pleasure it gives him is a victim to his thirst for fame; then a desire to increase his fortune follows close upon this thirst for fame; he becomes grasping; but only because the first vice leads him on to this. Then this grasping after money and superiority engenders either anger with his kith and kin, or pride towards his inferiors, or envy of those above him; then hypocrisy comes in after this envy; a soured temper after that; a misanthropical spirit after that; and behind them all a state of condemnation which ends in the dark fires of hell. You see the chain; how all follows from one cherished passion. Seeing, then, that this inseparable train of moral diseases has entered once for all into the world, one single way of escape is pointed out to us in the exhortations of the inspired writings; and that is to separate ourselves from the life which involves this sequence of sufferings. If we haunt Sodom, we cannot escape the rain of fire; nor if one who has fled out of her looks back upon her desolation, can he fail to become a pillar of salt rooted to the spot. We cannot be rid of the Egyptian bondage, unless we leave Egypt, that is, this life that lies under water[fn-26-P2688_1838191:29-nf] , and pass, not that Red Sea, but this black and gloomy Sea of life. But suppose we remain in this evil bondage, and, to use the Master's words, \"the truth shall not have made us free,\" how can one who seeks a lie and wanders in the maze of this world ever come to the truth? How can one who has surrendered his existence to be chained by nature run away from this captivity? An illustration will make our meaning clearer. A winter torrent[fn-26-P2689_1838684:30-nf] , which, impetuous in itself, becomes swollen and carries down beneath its stream trees and boulders and anything that comes in its way, is death and danger to those alone who live along its course; for those who have got well out of its way it rages in vain. Just so, only the man who lives in the turmoil of life has to feel its force; only he has to receive those sufferings which nature's stream, descending in a flood of troubles, must, to be true to its kind, bring to those who journey on its banks. But if a man leaves this torrent, and these \"proud waters[fn-26-P2690_1839268:31-nf] ,\" he will escape from being \"a prey to the teeth\" of this life, as the Psalm goes on to say, and, as \"a bird from the snare,\" on virtue's wings. This simile, then, of the torrent holds; human life is a tossing and tumultuous stream sweeping down to find its natural level; none of the objects sought for in it last till the seekers are satisfied; all that is carried to them by this stream comes near, just touches them, and passes on; so that the present moment in this impetuous flow eludes enjoyment, for the after-current snatches it from their view. It would be our interest therefore to keep far away from such a stream, lest, engaged on temporal things, we should neglect eternity. How can a man keep for ever anything here, be his love for it never so passionate? Which of life's most cherished objects endures always? What flower of prime? What gift of strength and beauty? What wealth, or fame, or power? They all have their transient bloom, and then melt away into their opposites. Who can continue in life's prime? Whose strength lasts for ever? Has not Nature made the bloom of beauty even more shortlived than the shows of spring? For they blossom in their season, and after withering for a while again revive; after another shedding they are again in leaf, and retain their beauty of to-day to a late prime. But Nature exhibits the human bloom only in the spring of early life; then she kills it; it is vanished in the frosts of age. All other delights also deceive the bodily eye for a time, and then pass behind the veil of oblivion. Nature's inevitable changes are many; they agonize him whose love is passionate. One way of escape is open: it is, to be attached to none of these things, and to get as far away as possible from the society of this emotional and sensual world; or rather, for a man to go outside the feelings which his own body gives rise to. Then, as he does not live for the flesh, he will not be subject to the troubles of the flesh. But this amounts to living for the spirit only, and imitating all we can the employment of the world of spirits. There they neither marry, nor are given in marriage. Their work and their excellence is to contemplate the Father of all purity, and to beautify the lines of their own character from the Source of all beauty, so far as imitation of It is possible.","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":2,"verse":21,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_41_the_epistle_of_barnabas","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"36","folder":"ANF-01","text":"When, therefore, He has fulfilled the commandment, what saith He? \"Who is he that will contend with Me? let him oppose Me: or who is he that will enter into judgment with Me? let him draw near to the servant of the Lord.\"[fn-32-P3200_538882:50-nf] \"Woe unto you, for ye shall all wax old, like a garment, and the moth shall eat you up.\"[fn-32-P3201_538987:51-nf] And again the prophet says, \"Since[fn-32-P3202_539038:52-nf] as a mighty stone He is laid for crushing, behold I cast down for the foundations of Zion a stone, precious, elect, a corner-stone, honourable.\" Next, what says He? \"And he who shall trust[fn-32-P3203_539295:53-nf] in it shall live for ever.\" Is our hope, then, upon a stone?

In a word, the assertors of fate attribute both men's good and evil doings and fortunes to fate; but God in the ill fortunes of men follows up their merits with due retribution, while good fortunes He bestows by undeserved grace with a merciful will; doing both the one and the other not according to a temporal conjunction of stars, but according to the eternal and high counsel of His severity and goodness.

For we say that all men who are children of the devil are also children of the world; but not that all children of the world are also children of the devil. Far be it from us to say that the holy fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and others of this kind, were children of the devil when they were begetting in marriage, and those believers who until now and still hereafter continue to beget. And yet we cannot contradict the Lord when He says, \"The children of this world marry and give in marriage.\"[fn-54-P5404_2118890:13-nf] Some, therefore, are children of this world, and yet are not children of the devil. For although the devil is the author and source of all sins, yet it is not every sin that makes children of the devil; for the children of God also sin, since if they say they have no sins they deceive themselves, and the truth is not in them.[fn-54-P5405_2119236:14-nf] But they sin in virtue of that condition by which they are still children of this world; but by that grace wherewith they are the children of God they certainly sin not, because every one that is born of God sinneth not.[fn-54-P5406_2119475:15-nf] But unbelief makes children of the devil; and unbelief is specially called sin, as if it were the only one, if it is not expressed what is the nature of the sin.

He was living in Bithynia, holding an office of no small importance from the Emperor, viz., the stewardship of his revenue, and care of the exchequer: for this had been assigned to him by the Emperor as a prelude to the highest offices. And when, a short time ago, the earthquake[fn-35-P3577_1017300:27-nf] in Nicaea occurred, which is said to have been the most serious within the memory of man, overwhelming in a common destruction almost all the inhabitants and the beauty of the city, he alone, or with very few of the men of rank, survived the danger, being shielded by the very falling ruins in his incredible escape, and bearing slight traces of the peril; yet he allowed fear to lead him to a more important salvation, for he dedicated himself entirely to the Supreme Providence; he renounced the service of transitory things, and attached himself to another court. This he both purposed himself, and made the object of the united earnest prayers to which he invited me by letter, when I seized this opportunity to give him warning,[fn-35-P3578_1018092:28-nf] as I never ceased to do when pained that his great nature should be occupied in affairs beneath it, and that a soul so fitted for philosophy should, like the sun behind a cloud, be obscured amid the whirl of public life.

Again, if you ask why, of all the kinds of food prohibited in the former typical dispensation, we abstain only from food offered to idols and from what dies of itself, you shall hear, if for once you will prefer the truth to idle calumnies. The reason why it is not expedient for a Christian to eat food offered to idols is given by the apostle: \"I would not,\" he says, \"that ye should have fellowship with demons.\" Not that he finds fault with sacrifice itself, as offered by the fathers to typify the blood of the sacrifice with which Christ has redeemed us. For he first says, \"The things which the Gentiles offer, they offer to demons, and not to God;\" and then adds these words: \"I would not that ye should have fellowship with demons.\"[fn-25-P2502_1511627:24-nf] If the uncleanness were in the nature of sacrificial flesh. it would necessarily pollute even when eaten in ignorance. But the reason for not partaking knowingly is not in the nature of the food, but, for conscience sake, not to seem to have fellowship with demons. As regards what dies of itself, I suppose the reason why such food was prohibited was that the flesh of animals which have died of themselves is diseased, and is not likely to be wholesome, which is the chief thing in food. The observance of pouring out the blood which was enjoined in ancient times upon Noah himself after the deluge,[fn-25-P2503_1512248:25-nf] the meaning of which we have already explained, is thought by many to be what is meant in the Acts of the Apostles, where we read that the Gentiles were required to abstain from fornication, and from things sacrificed, and from blood,[fn-25-P2504_1512500:26-nf] that is, from flesh of which the blood has not been poured out. Others give a different meaning to the words, and think that to abstain from blood means not to be polluted with the crime of murder. It would take too long to settle this question, and it is not necessary. For, allowing that the apostles did on that occasion require Christians to abstain from the blood of animals, and not to eat of things strangled, they seem to me to have consulted the time in choosing an easy observance that could not be burdensome to any one, and which the Gentiles might have in common with the Israelities, for the sake of the Corner-stone, who makes both one in Himself;[fn-25-P2505_1513181:27-nf] while at the same time they would be reminded how the Church of all nations was prefigured by the ark of Noah, when God gave this command,-a type which began to be fulfilled in the time of the apostles by the accession of the Gentiles to the faith. But since the close of that period during which the two walls of the circumcision and the uncircumcision, although united in the Corner-stone, still retained some distinctive peculiarities, and now that the Church has become so entirely Gentile that none who are outwardly Israelites are to be found in it, no Christian feels bound to abstain from thrushes or small birds because their blood has not been poured out, or from hares because they are killed by a stroke on the neck without shedding their blood. Any who still are afraid to touch these things are laughed at by the rest: so general is the conviction of the truth, that \"not what entereth into the mouth defileth you, but what cometh out of it;\"[fn-25-P2506_1514159:28-nf] that evil lies in the commission of sin, and not in the nature of any food in ordinary use.","title":"Book XXXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_38_letter_of_an_inquirer_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":" 8.

And do not impute lack of power to God, the Creator of all things, by imagining his work to have ended in the fall into an abyss which He in His redemptive purpose was unable to reach. We speak of infernal and supernal, because we are bounded by the definite circumference of the body, and are confined within the limits of the region prescribed to us. But to God, Who is present everywhere and absent nowhere, what is infernal and what supernal? Notwithstanding, through the assumption of a body there is room for these also. The flesh which had been deposited in the sepulchre, is raised, that might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet, \"Thou wilt not suffer Thy Holy One to see corruption.\"[fn-97-P9794_2751819:103-nf] He returned, therefore, a victor from the dead, leading with Him the spoils of hell. For He led forth those who were held in captivity by death, as He Himself had foretold, when He said, \"When I shall be lifted up from the earth I shall draw all unto Me.\"[fn-97-P9795_2752095:104-nf] To this the Gospel bears witness, when it says, \"The graves were opened, and many bodies of saints which slept arose, and appeared unto many, and entered into the holy City,\"[fn-97-P9796_2752291:105-nf] that city, doubtless, of which the Apostle says, \"Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the Mother of us all.\"[fn-97-P9797_2752448:106-nf] As also he says again to the Hebrews, \"It became Him, for Whom are all things, and by Whom are all things, Who had brought many sons into glory, to make the Author of their salvation perfect through suffering.\"[fn-97-P9798_2752679:107-nf] Sitting, therefore, on the right hand of God in the highest heavens, He placed there that human flesh, made perfect through sufferings, which had fallen to death by the lapse of the first man, but was now restored by the virtue of the resurrection. Whence also the Apostle says, \"Who hath raised us up together and made us sit together in the heavenly places.\"[fn-97-P9799_2753060:108-nf] For He was the potter, Who, as the Prophet Jeremiah teaches, \"took up again with His hands, and formed anew, as it seemed good to Him, the vessel which had fallen from His hands and was broken in pieces.\"[fn-98-P9800_2753284:109-nf] And it seemed good to Him that the mortal and corruptible body which He had assumed, this body raised from the rocky sepulchre and rendered immortal and incorruptible, He should now place not on the earth but in heaven, and at His Father's right hand. The Scriptures of the Old Testament are full of these mysteries. No Prophet, no Lawgiver, no Psalmist is silent, but almost every one of the sacred pages speaks of them. It seems superfluous, therefore, to linger in collecting testimonies; vet we will cite some few, remitting those who desire to drink more largely to the well-springs of the divine volumes themselves.","title":"A Commentary on the Apostles' Creed.","author":"Rufinus"},{"chapter":2,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_45_a_commentary_on_the_apostles_creed_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"119","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"46.

In reference to which glory, promised by the Saviour's mouth, the holy Apostle says, \"It is sown as an animal body; it will rise a spiritual body.\"[fn-98-P9891_2792471:177-nf] For if it is true, as it certainly is true, that God will vouchsafe to associate every one of the righteous and of the saints in companionship with the angels, it is certain that He will change their bodies also into the glory of a spiritual body.","title":"A Commentary on the Apostles' Creed.","author":"Rufinus"},{"chapter":2,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_14_npnf2_14_13_the_canons_of_the_318_holy_fathers_assembled_in_the_city_of_nice_in_bithynia_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"NPNF2-14","text":"We know, by the first apology of St. Justin (Apol. c. 29) that a century before Origen, a young man had desired to be mutilated by physicians, for the purpose of completely refuting the charge of vice which the heathen brought against the worship of Christians.

Further, if any one fails to understand how it can be that we assert that the sacrament is not rightly conferred among the Donatists, while we confess that it exists among them, let him observe that we also deny that it exists rightly among them, just as they deny that it exists rightly among those who quit their communion. Let him also consider the analogy of the military mark, which, though it can both be retained, as by deserters, and, also be received by those who are not in the army, yet ought not to be either received or retained outside its ranks; and, at the same time, it is not changed or renewed when a man is enlisted or brought back to his service. However, we must distinguish between the case of those who unwittingly join the ranks of these heretics, under the impression that they are entering the true Church of Christ, and those who know that there is no other Catholic Church save that which, according to the promise, is spread abroad throughout the whole world, and extends even to the utmost limits of the earth; which, rising amid tares, and seeking rest in the future from the weariness of offenses, says in the Book of Psalms, \"From the end of the earth I cried unto Thee, while my heart was in weariness: Thou didst exalt me on a rock.\"[fn-30-P3048_1792364:7-nf] But the rock was Christ, in whom the apostle says that we are now raised up, and set together in heavenly places, though not yet actually, but only in hope.[fn-30-P3049_1792562:8-nf] And so the psalm goes on to say, \"Thou wast my guide, because Thou art become my hope, a tower of strength from the face of the enemy.\"[fn-30-P3050_1792713:9-nf] By means of His promises, which are like spears and javelins stored up in a strongly fortified place, the enemy is not only guarded against, but overthrown, as he clothes his wolves in sheep's clothing,[fn-30-P3051_1792958:10-nf] that they may say, \"Lo, here is Christ, or there;\"[fn-30-P3052_1793029:11-nf] and that they may separate many from the Catholic city which is built upon a hill, and bring them down to the isolation of their own snares, so as utterly to destroy them. And these men, knowing this, choose to receive the baptism of Christ without the limits of the communion of the unity of Christ's body, though they intend afterwards, with the sacrament which they have received elsewhere, to pass into that very communion. For they propose to receive Christ's baptism in antagonism to the Church of Christ, well knowing that it is so even on the very day on which they receive it. And if this is a sin, who is the man that will say, Grant that for a single day I may commit sin? For if he proposes to pass over to the Catholic Church, I would fain ask why. What other answer can he give, but that it is ill to belong to the party of Donatus, and not to the unity of the Catholic Church? Just so many days, then, as you commit this ill, of so many days' sin are you going to be guilty. And it may be said that there is greater sin in more days' commission of it, and less in fewer; but in no wise can it be said that no sin is committed at all. But what is the need of allowing this accursed wrong for a single day, or a single hour? For the man who wishes this license to be granted him, might as well ask of the Church, or of God Himself, that for a single day he should be permitted to apostatize. For there is no reason why he should fear to be an apostate for a day, if he does not shrink from being for that time a schismatic or a heretic.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_38_sermon_xxi_lxxi_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"3.

First then in order to our receiving eternal life which shall be given at the last, there comes to us a gift from God's goodness from the beginning of our faith, to wit, the remission of sins. For while they remain, there remains in some sort enmity against God, and alienation from Him, which comes from what is evil in us; since Scripture does not speak falsely, which says, \"Your sins separate between you and God.\"[fn-39-P3945_1705645:59-nf] He does not then bestow on us His good things, except He take away our evil things. And the former increase in proportion as the latter are diminished; nor will the one be perfected, till the other be brought to an end. But now that the Lord Jesus forgives sins by the Holy Ghost, just as by the Holy Ghost He casts out devils, may be understood by this, that after His Resurrection from the dead, when He had said to His disciples, \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost,\" He immediately subjoined, \"Whosesoever sins ye remit, they shall be remitted unto them, and whosesoever sins ye retain, they shall be retained.\"[fn-39-P3946_1706270:60-nf] For that regeneration also, in which there is a remission of all past sins, is wrought by the Holy Ghost, as the Lord saith, \"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\"[fn-39-P3947_1706509:61-nf] But it is one thing to be born of the Spirit, another to be nourished by the Spirit; just as it is one thing to be born of the flesh, which happens when the mother is delivered of her child; another to be nourished by the flesh, which happens when she gives suck to her infant, who turns himself that he may drink with pleasure thither whence he was born, to have life; that he may receive the support of life from thence, whence he received the beginning of his birth. We must believe then that the first blessing of God's goodness in the Holy Ghost is the remission of sins. Whence the preaching of John the Baptist, who was sent as the forerunner of the Lord, also begins with it. For thus it is written, \"In those days came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, saying, Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\"[fn-39-P3948_1707369:62-nf] Hence too the beginning of our Lord's preaching, as we read, \"From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\"[fn-39-P3949_1707549:63-nf] Now John, amongst the other things which he spake tothose who came to be baptized by him, said, \"I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.\"[fn-39-P3950_1707856:64-nf] The Lord also said, \"John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence,\"[fn-39-P3951_1707996:65-nf] even at Pentecost. Now as to John's expression, \"with fire,\" though tribulation also might be understood, which believers were to suffer for the name of Christ; yet may we reasonably think that the same Holy Spirit is signified also under the name of \"fire.\"[fn-39-P3952_1708271:66-nf] Wherefore when He came it is said, \"And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.\"[fn-39-P3953_1708468:67-nf] Hence also the Lord Himself said, \"I am come to send fire on the earth.\"[fn-39-P3954_1708558:68-nf] Hence also the Apostle saith, \"Fervent in the spirit;\"[fn-39-P3955_1708632:69-nf] for from Him comes the fervour of love. \"For it is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.\"[fn-39-P3956_1708772:70-nf] And the contrary to this fervour is what the Lord said, \"The love of many shall wax cold.\"[fn-39-P3957_1708879:71-nf] Now perfect love is the perfect gift of the Holy Spirit. But the first \"gift\" is that which is concerned with the remission of sins; by which blessing \"we are delivered from the power of darkness;\"[fn-39-P3958_1709098:72-nf] and the prince of this world,[fn-39-P3959_1709145:73-nf] who worketh in the children of disobedience\"[fn-39-P3960_1709209:74-nf] by no other power than the fellowship and the bond of sin, is \"cast out\" by our faith.

How are there \"two metretae apiece\"? Circumcision and uncircumcision. Scripture mentions these two classes of people, and leaves out no kind of men, when it says, \"Circumcision and uncircumcision;\"[fn-6-P639_307786:26-nf] in these two appellations thou hast all nations: they are the two metretae apiece.

We do not, however, assert that it indicates any \"passion\" on His part, but that it is something which is asumed in order to discipline by stern means those sinners who have committed many and grievous sins. For that which is called God's \"wrath,\" and \"anger,\" is a means of discipline; and that such a view is agreeable to Scripture, is evident from what is said in the Psalms 6, \"O Lord, rebuke me not in Thine anger, neither chasten me in Thy hot displeasure; \"[fn-95-P9552_2476540:304-nf] and also in jeremiah. \"O Lord, correct me, but with judgment: not in Thine anger, lest Thou bring me to nothing.\"[fn-95-P9553_2476676:305-nf] Any one, moreover, who reads in the second book of Kings of the \"wrath\" of God, inducing David to number the people, and finds from the first book of Chronicles that it was the devil who suggested this measure, will, on comparing together the two statements, easily see for what purpose the \"wrath\" is mentioned, of which \"wrath,\" as the Apostle Paul declares, all men are children: \"We were by nature children of wrath, even as others.\"[fn-95-P9554_2477137:306-nf] Moreover, that \"wrath\" is no passion on the part of God, but that each one bringS it upon himself by his sins, will be clear from the further statement of Paul: \"Or despisest thou the riches of His goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? But after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God.\" How, then, can any one treasure up for himself \"wrath\" against a \"day of wrath,\" if \"wrath\" be understood in the sense of \"passion? \"or how can the \"passion of wrath\" be a help to discipline? Besides, the Scripture, which tells us not to be angry at all, and which says in the Psalms 37, \"Cease from anger, and forsake wrath,\"[fn-95-P9555_2477951:307-nf] and which commands us by the mouth of Paul to \"put off all these, anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication,\"[fn-95-P9556_2478099:308-nf] would not involve God in the same passion from which it would have us to be altogether free. It is manifest, further, that the language used regarding the wrath of God is to be understood figuratively from what is related of His \"sleep,\" from which, as if awaking Him, the prophet says: \"Awake, why sleepest Thou, Lord? \"[fn-95-P9557_2478445:309-nf] and again: \"Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.\"[fn-95-P9558_2478576:310-nf] If, then, \"sleep\" must mean something else, and not what the first acceptation of the word conveys, why should not \"wrath\" also be understood in a similar way? The \"threatenings,\" again, are intimations of the (punishments) which are to befall the wicked: for it is as if one were to call the words of a physician \"threats,\" when he tells his patients, \"I will have to use the knife, and apply cauteries, if you do not obey my prescriptions, and regulate your diet and mode of life in such a way as I direct you.\" It is no human passions, then, which we ascribe to God, nor impious opinions which we entertain of Him; nor do we err when we present the various narratives concerning Him, drawn from the Scriptures themselves, after careful comparison one with another. For those who are wise ambassadors of the \"word\" have no other object in view than to free as far as they can their hearers from weak opinions, and to endue them with intelligence.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_59_book_ii_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"76","folder":"ANF-02","text":"These three things, therefore, our philosopher attaches himself to: first, speculation; second, the performance of the precepts; third, the forming of good men;-which, concurring, form the Gnostic.

Ortum autem et interitum creaturarum propter ipsorum naturas fieri necesse est, usque ad perfectam distinctionem et restitutionem electionis, per quam, quae etiam sunt mundo permistae et confusae substantiae, proprietati suae restituuntur. Unde merito cum de consummatione Logos locutus fuerat, ait Salome: \"Quousque morientur homines? \"Hominem autem vocat Scriptura dupliciter: et eum, qui apparet, et animam; et eum rursus, qui servatur, et eum qui non. Mors autem animae dicitur peccatum. Quare caute et considerate respondet Dominus: \"Quoadusque pepererint mulieres,\" hoc est quandiu operabuntur cupiditates. \"Et ideo quemadmodum per unum hominem peccatum ingressum est in mundum, per peccaturn quoque mors ad omnes homines pervasit, quatenus omnes peccaverunt; et regnavit mors ab Adam usque ad Moysen,\"[fn-63-P6349_1940452:106-nf] inquit Apostolus: naturali autem divinae ceconomiae necessitate mors sequitur generationem: et corporis et animae conjunctionem consequitur eorum dissolutio.

Unde non ego quidem arbitror Apostolum abhorrere vitam, quae est in came, cum dicit: \"Sed in omni fiducia, ut semper, nunc quoque Christus magnificabitur in corpore meo, sire per vitam, sire per mortera. Mihi enim vivere Christus et mori lucrum. Si autem vivere in carne, et hoc quoque mihi fructus operis, quid eligam nescio, et coarctor ex duobus, cupiens resolvi, et esse cum Christo: multo enim melius: manere autem in carne, est magis necessarium propter vos.\"[fn-63-P6351_1941591:108-nf] Per haec enim, ut puto, aperte ostendit, exitus quidem e corpore perfectionem, esse in Dei dilectionem: ejus autem prae sentiae in carne, ex grato animo profectam tolerantiam, propter eos, qui salute indigent. Quid vero? non etiam ea, quae deinceps sequuntur, ex ils, quae dicta sunt ad Salomen, subjungunt ii, qui quidvis potius quam quae est ex veritate, evangelicam regulam sunt secuti?

And so when we have succeeded in this, we shall be able to arrive at the third as well, in which we go forth from the house of our former parent, (who, as we know well, was our father from our Very birth, after the old man, when we were \"by nature children of wrath, as others also,\"[fn-38-P3832_1428347:14-nf] ) and fix our whole mental gaze on things celestial. And of this father Scripture says to Jerusalem which had despised God the true Father, \"Thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother a Hittite;\"[fn-38-P3833_1428559:15-nf] and in the gospel we read \"Ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye love to do.\"[fn-38-P3834_1428682:16-nf] And when we have left him, as we pass from things visible to things unseen we shall be able to say with the Apostle: \"But we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle is dissolved we have a habitation from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,\"[fn-38-P3835_1428978:17-nf] and this also, which we quoted a little while ago: \"But our conversation is in heaven, whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus, who will reform the body of our low estate made like to the body of His glory,\"[fn-38-P3836_1429216:18-nf] and this of the blessed David: \"For I am a sojourner upon the earth,\" and \"a stranger as all my fathers were;\"[fn-38-P3837_1429351:19-nf] so that we may in accordance with the Lord's word be made like those of whom the Lord speaks to His Father in the gospel as follows: \"They are not of the world, as I am not of the world,\"[fn-38-P3838_1429594:20-nf] and again to the Apostles themselves: \"If ye were of this world, the world would love its own: but because ye are not of this world, therefore the world hateth you.\"[fn-38-P3839_1429783:21-nf] Of this third renunciation then we shall succeed in reaching the perfection, whenever our soul is sullied by no stain of carnal coarseness, but, all such having been carefully eliminated, it has been freed from every earthly quality and desire, and by constant meditation on things Divine, and spiritual contemplation has so far passed on to things unseen, that in its earnest seeking after things above and things spiritual it no longer feels that it is prisoned in this fragile flesh, and bodily form, but is caught up into such an ecstasy as not only to hear no words with the outward ear, or to busy itself with gazing on the forms of things present, but not even to see things close at hand, or large objects straight before the very eyes. And of this no one can understand the truth and force, except one who has made trial of what has been said, under the teaching of experience; viz., one, the eyes of whose soul the Lord has turned away from all things present, so that he no longer considers them as things that will soon pass away, but as things that are already done with, and sees them vanish into nothing, like misty smoke; and like Enoch, \"walking with God,\" and \"translated\" from human life and fashions, not \"be found\" amid the vanities of this life: And that this actually happened corporeally in the case of Enoch the book of Genesis thus tells us. \"And Enoch walked with God, and was not found, for God translated him.\" And the Apostle also says: \"By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death,\" the death namely of which the Lord says in the gospel: \"He that liveth and believeth in me shall not die eternally.\"[fn-38-P3840_1431450:22-nf] Wherefore, if we are anxious to attain true perfection, we ought to look to it that as we have outwardly with the body made light of parents, home, the riches and pleasures of the world, we may also inwardly with the heart forsake all these things and never be drawn back by any desires to those things which we have forsaken, as those who were led up by Moses, though they did not literally go back, are yet said to have returned in heart to Egypt; viz., by forsaking God who had led them forth with such mighty signs, and by worshipping the idols of Egypt of which they had thought scorn, as Scripture says: \"And in their hearts they turned back into Egypt, saying to Aaron: Make us gods to go before us,\"[fn-38-P3841_1432211:23-nf] for we should fall into like condemnation with those who, while dwelling in the wilderness, after they had tasted manna from heaven, lusted after the filthy food of sins, and of mean baseness, and should seem together with them to murmur in the same way: \"It was well with us in Egypt, when we sat over the flesh pots and ate the onions, and garlic, and cucumbers, and melons:\"[fn-38-P3842_1432612:24-nf] A form of speech, which, although it referred primarily to that people, we yet see fulfilled today in our own case and mode of life: for everyone who after renouncing this world turns back to his old desires, and reverts to his former likings asserts in heart and act the very same thing that they did, and says \"It was well with me in Egypt,\" and I am afraid that the number of these will be as large as that of the multitudes of backsliders of whom we read under Moses, for though they were reckoned as six hundred and three thousand armed men who came out of Egypt, of this number not more than two entered the land of promise. Wherefore we should be careful to take examples of goodness from those who are few and far between, because according to that figure of which we have spoken in the gospel \"Many are called but few\" are said to be \"chosen.\"[fn-38-P3843_1433511:25-nf] A renunciation then in body alone, and a mere change of place from Egypt will not do us any good, if we do not succeed in achieving that renunciation in heart, which is far higher and more valuable. For of that mere bodily renunciation of which we have spoken the apostle declares as follows: \"Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and give my body to be burned, but have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\"[fn-38-P3844_1433955:26-nf] And the blessed Apostle would never have said this had it not been that he foresaw by the spirit that some who had given all their goods to feed the poor would not be able to attain to evangelical perfection and the lofty heights of charity, because while pride or impatience ruled over their hearts they were not careful to purify themselves from their former sins, and unrestrained habits, and on that account could never attain to that love of God which never faileth, and these, as they fall short in this second stage of renunciation, can still less reach that third stage which is most certainly far higher. But consider too in your minds with great care the fact that he did not simply say \"If I bestow my goods.\" For it might perhaps be thought that he spoke of one who had not fulfilled the command of the gospel, but had kept back something for himself, as some half-hearted persons do. But he says \"Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor,\" i.e., even if my renunciation of those earthly riches be perfect. And to this renunciation he adds something still greater: \"And though I give my body to be burned, but have not charity, I am nothing:\" As if he had said in other words, though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor in accordance with that command in the gospel, where we are told \"If thou wilt be perfect, go sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven,\"[fn-38-P3845_1435398:27-nf] renouncing them so as to keep back nothing at all for myself, and though to this distribution (of my goods) I should by the burning of my flesh add martyrdom so as to give up my body for Christ, and yet be impatient, or passionate or envious or proud, or excited by wrongs done by others, or seek what is mine, or indulge in evil thoughts, or not be ready and patient in bearing all that can be inflicted on me, this renunciation and the burning of the outer man will profit me nothing, while the inner man is still involved in the former sins, because, while in the fervour of the early days of my conversion I made light of the mere worldly substance, which is said to be not good or evil in itself but indifferent, I took no care to cast out in like manner the injurious powers of a bad heart, or to attain to that love of the Lord which is patient, which is \"kind, which envieth not, is not puffed up, is not soon angry, dealeth not perversely, seeketh not her own, thinketh no evil,\" which \"beareth all things, endureth all things,\"[fn-38-P3846_1436459:28-nf] and which lastly never suffers him who follows after it to fall by the deceitfulness of sin.","title":"III.

For \"every man is tempted of his own lust. Then lust when it has conceived beareth sin, and sin when it is consummated begets death.\"[fn-41-P4104_1511974:3-nf] For the first Adam could not have fallen a victim to gluttony unless he had had material food at hand, and had used it wrongly, nor could the second Adam be tempted without the enticement of some object, when it was said to Him: \"If Thou art the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.\"[fn-41-P4105_1512297:4-nf] And it is clear to everybody that fornication also is only completedby a bodily act, as God says of this spirit to the blessed Job: \"And his force is in his loins, and his strength in the navel of his belly.\"[fn-41-P4106_1512525:5-nf] And so these two faults in particular, which are carried into effect by the aid of the flesh, especially require bodily abstinence as well as spiritual care of the soul; since the determination of the mind is not in itself enough to resist their attacks (as is sometimes the case with anger or gloominess or the other passions, which an effort of the mind alone can overcome without any mortification of the flesh); but bodily chastisement must be used as well, and be carried out by means of fasting and vigils and acts of contrition; and to this must be added change of scene, because since these sins are the results of faults of both mind and body, so they can only be overcome by the united efforts of both. And although the blessed Apostle says generallythat all faults are carnal, since he enumerates enmities and anger and heresies among other works of the flesh,[fn-41-P4107_1513412:6-nf] yet in order to cure them and to discover their nature more exactly we make a twofold division of them: for we call some of them carnal, and some spiritual. And those we call carnal, which specially have to do with pampering the appetites of the flesh, and with which it is so charmed and satisfied, that sometimes it excites the mind when at rest and even drags it against its will to consent to its desire. Of which the blessed Apostle says: \"In which also we all walked in time past in the desires of our flesh, fulfilling the will of the flesh and of our thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath even as the rest.\"[fn-41-P4108_1514056:7-nf] But we call those spiritual which spring only from the impulse of the mind andnot merely contribute no pleasure to the flesh, but actually bring on it a weakness that is harmful to it, and only feed a diseased mind with the food of a most miserable pleasure. And therefore these need a single medicine for the heart: but those which are carnal can only be cured, as we said, by a double remedy. Whence it is extremely useful for those who aspire to purity, to begin by withdrawing from themselves the material which feeds these carnal passions, through which opportunity for or recollection of these same desires can arise in a soul that is still affected by the evil. For a complicated disease needs a complicated remedy. For from the body the object and material which would allure it must be withdrawn, for fear lest the lust should endeavour to break out into act; and before the mind we should no less carefully place diligent meditation on Scripture and watchful anxiety and the withdrawal into solitude, lest it should give birth to desire even in thought. But as regards other faults intercourse with our fellows is no obstacle, or rather it is of the greatest possible use, to those who truly desire to get rid of them, because in mixing with others they more often meet with rebuke, and while they are more frequently provoked the existence of the faults is made evident, and so they are cured with speedy remedies.","title":"V.

This He said of the temple of His body.\"[fn-113-P11311_3078221:38-nf] And in other parts of holy Scripture where it speaks of the mystery of the resurrection to those whose ears are divinely opened, it says that the temple which has been destroyed shall be built up again of living and most precious stones, thereby giving us to understand that each of those who are led by the word of God to strive together in the duties of piety, will be a precious stone in the one great temple of God. Accordingly, Peter says, \"Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ; \"[fn-113-P11312_3078839:39-nf] and Paul also says, \"Being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ our Lord being the chief cornerstone.\"[fn-113-P11313_3078993:40-nf] And there is a similar hidden allusion in this passage in Isaiah, which is addressed to Jerusalem: \"Behold, I will lay thy stones with carbuncles, and lay thy foundations with sapphires. And I will make thy battlements of jasper, and thy gates of crystal, and all thy borders of pleasant stones. And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children.

Next certain bitter and terrible beings stood in the air and wished to hinder him from passing through. But when his conductors opposed them, they demanded whether he was not accountable to them. And when they wished to sum up the account from his birth, Antony's conductors stopped them, saying, `The Lord hath wiped out the sins from his birth, but from the time he became a monk, and devoted himself to God, it is permitted you to make a reckoning.' Then when they accused him and could not convict him, his way was free and unhindered. And immediately he saw himself, as it were, coming and standing by himself, and again he was Antony as before. Then forgetful of eating, he remained the rest of the day and through the whole of the night groaning and praying.

An angel talks with the Virgin, in order that the serpent may no more have converse with the woman. In the sixth month, it is said, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a virgin espoused to a man.[fn-12-P1243_323182:2-nf] Gabriel was sent to declare the world-wide salvation: Gabriel was sent to bear to Adam the signature of his restoration; Gabriel was sent to a virgin, in order to transform the dishonour of the female sex into honour; Gabriel was sent to prepare the worthy chamber for the pure spouse; Gabriel was sent to wed the creature with the Creator; Gabriel was sent to the animate palace of the King of the angels; Gabriel was sent to a virgin espoused to Joseph, but preserved for Jesus the Son of God. The incorporeal servant was sent to the virgin undefiled. One free from sin was sent to one that admitted no corruption. The light was sent that should announce the Sun of righteousness. The dawn was sent that should precede the light of the day. Gabriel was sent to proclaim Him who is in the bosom of the Father, and who yet was to be in the arms of the mother. Gabriel was sent to declare Him who is upon the throne, and yet also in the cavern. The subaltern was sent to utter aloud the mystery of the great King; the mystery, I mean, which is discerned by faith, and which cannot be searched out by officious curiosity; the mystery which is to be adored, not weighed; the mystery which is to be taken as a thing divine, and not measured. \"In the sixth month Gabriel was sent to a virgin.\" What is meant by this sixth month? What? It is the sixth month from the time when Elisabeth received the glad tidings, from the time that she conceived John. And how is this made plain? The archangel himself gives us the interpretation, when he says to the virgin: \"Behold, thy relation Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is now the sixth month with her, who was called barren.\"[fn-12-P1244_324901:3-nf] In the sixth month-that is evidently, therefore, the sixth month of the conception of John. For it was meet that the subaltern should go before; it was meet thai: the attendant should precede; it was meet that the herald of the Lord's coming should prepare the way for Him. In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent to a virgin espoused to a man; espoused, not united; espoused, yet kept intact. And for what purpose was she espoused? In order that the spoiler might not learn the mystery prematurely. For that the King was to come by a virgin, was a fact known to the wicked one. For he too heard these words of Isaiah: 4, Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son.\"[fn-12-P1245_325594:4-nf] And on every occasion, consequently, he kept watch upon the virgin's words, in order that, whenever this mystery should be fulfilled, he might prepare her dishonour. Wherefore the Lord came by an I espoused virgin, in order to elude the notice of the wicked one; for one who was espoused was pledged in fine to be her husband's. \"In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph.\" Hear what the prophet says about this man and the virgin: \"This book that is sealed shall be delivered to a man that is learned.\"[fn-12-P1246_326171:5-nf] What is meant by this sealed book, but just the virgin undefiled? From whom is this to be given? From the priests evidently. And to whom? To the artisan Joseph. As, then, the priests espoused Mary to Joseph as to a prudent husband, and committed her to his care in expectation of the time of marriage, and as it behoved him then on obtaining her to keep the virgin untouched, this was announced by the prophet long before, when he said: \"This book that is sealed shall be delivered to a man that is learned.\" And that man will say, I cannot read it. But why canst thou not read it, O Joseph? I cannot read it, he says, because the book is sealed. For whom, then, is it preserved? It is preserved as a place of sojourn for the Maker of the universe. But let us return to our immediate subject. In the sixth month Gabriel was sent to a virgin-he who received, indeed, such injunctions as these: \"Come hither now, archangel, and become the minister of a dread mystery which has been kept hid, and be thou the agent in the miracle. I am moved by my compassions to descend to earth in order to recover the lost Adam. Sin hath made him decay who was made in my image, and hath corrupted the work of my hands, and hath obscured the beauty which I formed. The wolf devours my nursling, the home of paradise is desolate, the tree of life is guarded by the flaming sword, the location of enjoyments is closed. My pity is evoked for the object of this enmity, and I desire to seize the enemy. Yet I wish to keep this mystery, which I confide to thee alone, still hid from all the powers of heaven. Go thou, therefore, to the Virgin Mary. Pass thou on to that animate city whereof the prophet spake in these words: `Glorious things were spoken of thee, O city of God.'[fn-12-P1247_327946:6-nf] Proceed, then, to my rational paradise; proceed to the gate of the east; proceed to the place of sojourn that is worthy of my word; proceed to that second heaven on earth; proceed to the light cloud, and announce to it the shower of my coming; proceed to the sanctuary prepared for me; proceed to the hall of the incarnation; proceed to the pure chamber of my generation after the flesh. Speak in the ears of my rational ark, so as to prepare for me the accesses of hearing. But neither disturb nor vex the soul of the virgin. Manifest thyself in a manner befitting that sanctuary, and hail her first with the voice of gladness. And address Mary with the saturation, `Hail, thou that art highly favoured, 'that I may show compassion for Eve in her depravation.\" The archangel heard these things, and considered them within himself, as was reasonable, and said: \"Strange is this matter; passing comprehension is this thing that is spoken. He who is the object of dread to the cherubim, He who cannot be looked upon by the seraphim, He who is incomprehensible to all the heavenly[fn-12-P1248_329044:7-nf] powers, does He give the assurance of His connection with a maiden? does He announce His own personal coming? yea more, does He hold out an access by hearing? and is He who condemned Eve, urgent to put such honour upon her daughter? For He says: `So as to prepare for me the accesses of hearing.' But can the womb contain Him who cannot be contained in space? Truly this is a dread mystery.\" While the angel is indulging such reflections, the Lord says to Him: \"Why art thou troubled and perplexed, O Gabriel? Hast thou not already been sent by me to Zacharias the priest? Hast thou not conveyed to him the glad tidings of the nativity of John? Didst thou not inflict upon the incredulous priest the penalty of speechlessness? Didst thou not punish the aged man with dumbness? Didst thou not make thy declaration, and I confirmed it? And has not the actual fact followed upon thy announcement of good? Did not the barren woman conceive? Did not the womb obey the word? Did not the malady of sterility depart? Did not the inert disposition of nature take to flight? Is not she now one that shows fruitfulness, who before was never pregnant? Can anything be impossible with me, the Creator of all? Wherefore, then, art thou tossed with doubt? \"What is the angel's answer to this? \"O Lord,\" he says, \"to remedy the defects of nature, to do away with the blast of evils, to recall the dead members to the power of life, to enjoin on nature the potency of generation, to remove barrenness in the case of members that have passed the common limit,[fn-12-P1249_330602:8-nf] to change the old and withered stalk into the appearance of verdant vigour, to set forth the fruitless soil suddenly as the producer of sheaves of corn,-to do all this is a work which, as it is ever the case, demands Thy power. And Sarah is a witness thereto, and along with her[fn-12-P1250_330906:9-nf] also Rebecca, and again Anna, who all, though bound by the dread ill of barrenness, were afterwards gifted by Thee with deliverance from that malady. But that a virgin should bring forth, without knowledge of a man, is something that goes beyond all the laws of nature; and dost Thou yet announce Thy coming to the maiden? The bounds of heaven and earth do not contain Thee, and how shall the womb of a virgin contain Thee? \"And the Lord says: \"How did the tent of Abraham contain me? \"[fn-12-P1251_331416:10-nf] And the angel says: \"As there were there the deeps of hospitality, O Lord, Thou didst show Thyself there to Abraham at the door of the tent, and didst pass quickly by it, as He who filleth all things. But how can Mary sustain the fire of the divinity? Thy throne blazes with the illumination of its splendour, and can the virgin receive Thee without being consumed? \"Then the Lord says: \"Yea surely, if the fire in the wilderness injured the bush, my coming will indeed also injure Mary; but if that fire which served as the adumbration of the advent of the fire of divinity from heaven fertilized the bush, and did not burn it, what wilt thou say of the Truth that descends not in a flame of fire, but in the form of rain? \"[fn-12-P1252_332159:11-nf] Thereupon the angel set himself to carry out the commission given him, and repaired to the Virgin, and addressed her with a loud voice, saying: \"Hail, thou that are highly favoured! the Lord is with thee. No longer shalt the devil be against thee; for where of old that adversary inflicted the wound, there now first of all does the Physician apply the salve of deliverance. Where death came forth, there has life now prepared its entrance. By a woman came the flood of our ills, and by a woman also our blessings have their spring. Hail, thou that are highly favoured! Be not thou ashamed, as if thou wert the cause of our condemnation. For thou art made the mother of Him who is at once Judge and Redeemer. Hail, thou stainless mother of the Bridegroom[fn-12-P1253_332976:12-nf] of a world bereft! Hail, thou that hast sunk in thy womb the death (that came) of the mother (Eve)! Hail, thou animate temple of temple of God! Hail, thou equal[fn-12-P1254_333236:13-nf] home of heaven and earth alike! Hail, thou amplest receptacle of the illimitable nature!\" But as these things are so, through her has come for the sick the Physician; for them that sit in darkness, the Sun of righteousness; for all that are tossed and tempest-beaten, the Anchor and the Port undisturbed by storm. For the servants in irreconcilable enmity has been born the Lord; and One has sojourned with us to be the bond of peace and the Redeemer of those led captive, and to be the peace for those involved in hostility. For He is our peace;[fn-12-P1255_333803:14-nf] and of that peace may it be granted that all we may receive the enjoyment, by the grace and kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ; to whom be the glory, honour, and power, now and ever, and unto all the ages of the ages.

And because she was found worthy, now were the two people to whom He had come made manifest: the Jewish people, to wit, of whom He said, \"I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel;\" and the people of the Gentiles, whose type this woman exhibited whom He had first rejected, saying, \"It is not meet to cast the children's bread to the dogs;\" and to whom when she said, \"Truth, Lord, yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table;\" He answered, \"O woman, great is thy faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt.\"[fn-47-P4704_2018362:25-nf] For of this people also was that centurion of whom the same Lord saith, \"Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.\" Because he had said,\" I am not worthy that Thou shouldest come under my roof, but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.\"[fn-47-P4705_2018669:26-nf] So then the Lord even before His Passion and Glorification pointed out two people, the one to whom He had come because of the promises to the Fathers; and the other whom for His mercy's sake He did not reject; that it might be fulfilled which had been promised to Abraham, \"In thy seed shall all nations be blessed.\"[fn-47-P4706_2019010:27-nf] Wherefore also the Apostle after the Lord's Resurrection and Ascension, when He was despised by the Jews, went to the Gentiles.

This one thing is that which the Lord intimates that He designed to signify by what He did. What else is there? He cometh to the tree being hungry, and seeketh fruit. Did He not know that it was not the time for it? What the cultivator of the tree knew, did not its Creator know? He seeketh on the tree then for fruit which it had not yet. Doth He really seek for it, or rather make a pretence of seeking it? For if He really sought it, He was mistaken. But this be far from Him, to be mistaken! He made then a pretence of seeking it. Fearing to allow this, that he maketh a pretence, thou dost confess that He was mistaken. Again, thou dost turn away from the idea of His being mistaken, and so run into that of His making a pretence. We are parched up between the two. If we are parched, let us beg for rain, that we may grow green, lest in saying anything unworthy of the Lord, we rather wither away. The Evangelist indeed says, \"He came to the tree, and found no fruit on it.\"[fn-47-P4799_2060701:17-nf] \"He found none,\" would not be said of Him, unless He had either really sought for it, or made a pretence of seeking, though He knew that there was none there. Wherefore we do not hesitate, let us by no means say that Christ was mistaken. What then? shall we say He made a pretence? Shall we say this? How shall we get out of this difficulty? Let us say what, if the Evangelist had not said of the Lord in another place, we should not of ourselves dare to say. Let us say what the Evangelist has written, and when we have said, let us understand it. But in order that we may understand it, let us first believe. For, \"unless ye believe,\" says the Prophet, \"ye shall not understand.\"[fn-48-P4800_2061403:18-nf] The Lord Christ after His Resurrection, was walking in the way with two of His disciples, by whom He was not yet recognised, and with whom He joined company as a third traveller. They came to the place whither they were going, and the Evangelist says, \"But He made a pretence as though He would have gone further.\"[fn-48-P4801_2061742:19-nf] But they kept Him, saying, in the spirit of a courteous kindness,[fn-48-P4802_2061828:20-nf] that it was already drawing toward evening, and praying Him to tarry there with them; being received and entertained by them, He breaketh Bread, and is known of them in blessing and breaking of the Bread. So then, let us not now fear to say, that He made a pretence of seeking, if He made a pretence of going further. But here there arises another question. Yesterday[fn-48-P4803_2062219:21-nf] I insisted[fn-48-P4804_2062414:22-nf] at some length on the truth which is in the Apostles; how then do we find any \"pretence\" in the Lord Himself? Therefore, Brethren, I must tell you, and teach you according to my poor abilities, which the Lord giveth me for your benefit, and must convey to you what ye may hold as a rule[fn-48-P4805_2062721:23-nf] in the interpretation of all Scripture. Everything that is said or done is to be understood either in its literal signification, or else it signifies something figuratively; or at least contains both of these at once, both its own literal interpretation,[fn-48-P4806_2062994:24-nf] and a figurative signification also. Thus I have set forth three things, examples of them must now be given; and from whence, but from the Holy Scriptures? It is said in its literal acceptation, that the Lord suffered, that He rose again, and ascended into heaven; that we shall rise again at the end of the world, that we shall reign with Him for ever, if we do not despise Him. Take all this as spoken literally, and look not out for figures; as it is expressed, so it really is. And so also with divers actions. The Apostle went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, the Apostle actually did this, it actually took place, it was an action peculiar to himself. It is a fact which he tells you; a simple fact according to its literal meaning. \"The stone which the builders refused, is become the Head of the corner,\"[fn-48-P4807_2063822:25-nf] is spoken in a figure.

They say then, that the Apostle writes, `Wherefore God also hath highly exalted Him, and given Him a Name which is above every name; that in the Name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth[fn-55-P5538_2192769:204-nf] ;' and David, `Wherefore God even Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows[fn-55-P5539_2192908:205-nf] .' Then they urge, as something acute: `If He was exalted and received grace, on a `wherefore,' and on a `wherefore' He was anointed, He received a reward of His purpose; but having acted from purpose, He is altogether of an alterable nature.' This is what Eusebius[fn-55-P5540_2193193:206-nf] and Arius have dared to say, nay to write while their partizans do not shrink from conversing about it in full market-place, not seeing how mad an argument they rise. For if He received what He had as a reward of His purpose, and would not have had it, unless He had needed it, and had His work to shew for it, then having gained it from virtue and promotion, with reason had He `therefore' been called Son and God, without being very Son. For what is from another by nature, is a real offspring, as Isaac was to Abraham, and Joseph to Jacob, and the radiance to the sun; but the so called sons from virtue and grace, have but in place of nature a grace by acquisition, and are something else besides[fn-55-P5541_2193939:207-nf] the gift itself; as the men who have received the Spirit by participation, concerning whom Scripture saith, `I begat and exalted children, and they rebelled against Me[fn-55-P5542_2194123:208-nf] .'

And if, as David says in the 71st Psalm, `His Name remaineth before the sun, and before the moon, from one generation to another[fn-55-P5567_2203895:229-nf] ,' how did He receive what He had always, even before He now received it? or how is He exalted, being before His exaltation the Most High? or how did He receive the right of being worshipped, who before He now received it, was ever worshipped? It is not a dark saying but a divine mystery[fn-55-P5568_2204225:230-nf] . `In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God;' but for our sakes afterwards the `Word was made flesh[fn-55-P5569_2204940:231-nf] .' And the term in question, `highly exalted,' does not signify that the essence of the Word was exalted, for He was ever and is `equal to God[fn-55-P5570_2205113:232-nf] ,' but the exaltation is of the manhood. Accordingly this is not said before the Word became flesh; that it might be plain that `humbled' and `exalted' are spoken of His human nature; for where there is humble estate, there too may be exaltation; and if because of His taking flesh `humbled' is written, it is clear that `highly exalted' is also said because of it. For of this was man's nature in want, because of the humble estate of the flesh and of death. Since then the Word, being the Image of the Father and immortal, took the form of the servant, and as man underwent for us death in His flesh, that thereby He might offer Himself for us through death to the Father; therefore also, as man, He is said because of us and for us to be highly exalted, that as by His death we all died in Christ, so again in the Christ Himself we might be highly exalted, being raised from the dead, and ascending into heaven, `whither the forerunner Jesus is for us entered, not into the figures of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us[fn-55-P5571_2206198:233-nf] .' But if now for us the Christ is entered into heaven itself, though He was even before and always Lord and Framer of the heavens, for us therefore is that present exaltation written. And as He Himself, who sanctifies all, says also that He sanctifies Himself to the Father for our sakes, not that the Word may become holy, but that He Himself may in Himself sanctify all of us, in like manner we must take the present phrase, `He highly exalted Him,' not that He Himself should be exalted, for He is the highest, but that He may become righteousness for us[fn-55-P5572_2206790:234-nf] , and we may be exalted in Him, and that we may enter the gates of heaven, which He has also opened for us, the forerunners saying, `Lift up your gates, O ye rulers, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of Glory shall come in[fn-55-P5573_2207573:235-nf] .' For here also not on Him were shut the gates, as being Lord and Maker of all, but because of us is this too written, to whom the door of paradise was shut. And therefore in a human relation, because of the flesh which He bore, it is said of Him, `Lift up your gates,' and `shall come in,' as if a man were entering; but in a divine relation on the other hand it is said of Him, since `the Word was God,' that He is the `Lord' and the `King of Glory.' Such our exaltation the Spirit foreannounced in the eighty-ninth Psalm, saying, `And in Thy righteousness shall they be exalted, for Thou art the glory of their strength[fn-55-P5574_2208217:236-nf] .'

That to be called creatures, then, and to be created belongs to things which have by nature a created essence, these passages are sufficient to remind us, though Scripture is full of the like; on the other hand that the single word `He created' does not simply denote the essence and mode of generation, David shews in the Psalm, `This shall be written for another generation, and the people that is created shall praise the Lord[fn-61-P6170_2461888:305-nf] ;' and again, `Create in me a clean heart, O God[fn-61-P6171_2461962:306-nf] ;' and Paul in Ephesians says, `Having abolished the law of commandments contained in ordinances, for to create in Himself of two one new man[fn-61-P6172_2462123:307-nf] ;' and again, `Put ye on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness[fn-61-P6173_2462243:308-nf] .' For neither David spoke of any people created in essence, nor prayed to have another heart than that he had, but meant renovation according to God and renewal; nor did Paul signify two persons created in essence in the Lord, nor again did he counsel us to put on any other man; but he called the life according to virtue the `man after God,' and by the `created' in Christ he meant the two people who are renewed in Him. Such too is the language of the book of Jeremiah; `The Lord created a new salvation for a planting, in which salvation men shall walk to and fro[fn-61-P6174_2462856:309-nf] ;' and in thus speaking, he does not mean any essence of a creature, but prophesies of the renewal of salvation among men, which has taken place in Christ for us. Such then being the difference between `the creatures' and the single word `He created,' if you find anywhere in divine Scripture the Lord called `creature,' produce it and fight; but if it is nowhere written that He is a creature, only He Himself says about Himself in the Proverbs, `The Lord created me,' shame upon you, both on the ground of the distinction aforesaid and for that the diction is like that of proverbs; and accordingly let `He created' be understood, not of His being a creature, but of that human nature which became His, for to this belongs creation. Indeed is it not evidently unfair in you, when David and Paul say `He created,' then indeed not to understand it of the essence and the generation, but the renewal; yet, when the Lord says `He created' to number His essence with the creatures? and again when Scripture says, `Wisdom built her an house, she set it upon seven pillars[fn-61-P6175_2464194:310-nf] ,' to understand `house' allegorically, but to take `He created' as it stands, and to fasten on it the idea of creature? and neither His being Framer of all has had any weight with you, nor have you feared His being the sole and proper Offspring of the Father, but recklessly, as if you had enlisted against Him, do ye fight, and think less of Him than of men.","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":2,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"83","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"55.

And it being so with us, sin has not lost its reign over the flesh, being inherent and not cast out of it. But the Apostle opposes such a doctrine a little before, when he says, `For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus[fn-62-P6244_2492394:366-nf] ;' and if in Christ we are created, then it is not He who is created, but we in Him; and thus the words `He created' are for our sake. For because of our need, the Word, though being Creator, endured words which are used of creatures; which are not proper to Him, as being the Word, but are ours who are created in Him. And as, since the Father is always, so is His Word, and always being, always says `I was daily His delight, rejoicing always before Him[fn-62-P6245_2492870:367-nf] ,' and `I am in the Father and the Father in Me[fn-62-P6246_2492941:368-nf] ;' so, when for our need He became man, consistently does He use language, as ourselves, `The Lord hath created Me,' that, by His dwelling in the flesh, sin might perfectly be expelled from the flesh, and we might have a free mind[fn-62-P6247_2493193:369-nf] . For what ought He, when made man, to say? `In the beginning I was man?' this were neither suitable to Him nor true; and as it beseemed not to say this, so it is natural and proper in the case of man to say, `He created' and `He made' Him. On this account then the reason of `He created' is added, namely, the need of the works; and where the reason is added, surely the reason rightly explains the lection. Thus here, when He says `He created,' He sets down the cause, `the works;' on the other hand, when He signifies absolutely the generation from the Father, straightway He adds, `Before all the hills He begets me[fn-62-P6248_2494647:370-nf] ;' but He does not add the `wherefore,' as in the case of `He created,' saying, `for the works,' but absolutely, `He begets me,' as in the text, `In the beginning was the Word[fn-62-P6249_2494846:371-nf] .'

The number 45, which was the maximum known to antiquity[fn-81-P8165_3202666:102-nf] , is confirmed by the Index, and by the fact that the citations from Cosmas (see above) tally with the order of the Letters in this Syriac version in every case where the letter is preserved entire, while Letter 39, preserved by a different writer, also tallies with the reference to it in the Index. It is therefore unassailably established on our existing evidence that the last Easter letter of Ath. was his `45th,' in other words that 45 is the full or normal number of his festal letters. This clinches the reckoning of the Index and Hist. Aceph. that he was bishop for 45 Easters (329-373 inclusive), i.e. for parts of 46 years (328-373 inclusive). Moreover it corroborates, and is rivetted firm by, the statement of Cyril. Alex. Ep. 1, that Athan. graced the see of Alexandria `fully 46 years.' `Il le dit en voulant faire son eloge: de sorte qu'il y a tout lieu de croire qu'il n'a point passe les 46 ans: car pour peu qu'il fust entré dans la 47me année, S.

We have just read the long lesson of the man born blind, whom the Lord Jesus restored to the light; but were we to attempt handling the whole of it, and considering, according to our ability, each passage in a way proportionate to its worth, the day would be insufficient. Wherefore I ask and warn your Charity not to require any words of ours on those passages whose meaning is manifest; for it would be too protracted to linger at each. I proceed, therefore, to set forth briefly the mystery of this blind man's enlightenment. All, certainly, that was done by our Lord Jesus Christ, both works and words, are worthy of our astonishment and admiration: His works, because they are facts; His words, because they are signs. If we reflect, then, on what is signified by the deed here done, that blind man is the human race; for this blindness had place in the first mar, through sin, from whom we all draw our origin, not only in respect of death, but also of unrighteousness. For if unbelief is blindness, and faith enlightenment, whom did Christ find a believer at His coming? seeing that the apostle, belonging himself to the family of the prophets, says: \"And we also in times past were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.\"[fn-18-P1870_1172368:1-nf] If \"children of wrath,\" then children of vengeance, children of punishment, children of hell. For how is it \"by nature,\" save that through the first man sinning moral evil rooted itself in us as a nature? If evil has so taken root within us, every man is born mentally blind.

If he does need one to guide and enlighten him, then is he blind from his birth.","title":"Tractate XLIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_52_tractate_xlvii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"5.

But God, who is good, multiplied His loving-kindness towards us, not only when He granted the common salvation of us all through His Word, but now also, when enemies have persecuted us, and have sought to seize upon us.

For He is the Word and the Power and the Wisdom of God, as Solomon testifies concerning Wisdom, that `being one, it can do all things, and remaining in itself, it maketh all things new; and passing upon holy souls, fashioneth the friends of God and the prophets[fn-92-P9241_3354859:17-nf] .' To those then who have not yet attained to the perfect way He becomes like a sheep giving milk, and this was administered by Paul: `I have fed you with milk, not with meat[fn-92-P9242_3355065:18-nf] .' To those who have advanced beyond the full stature of childhood, but still are weak as regards perfection, He is their food, according to their capacity, being again administered by Paul[fn-92-P9243_3355275:19-nf] , `Let him that is weak eat herbs.' But as soon as ever a man begins to walk in the perfect way, he is no longer fed with the things before mentioned, but he has the Word for bread, and flesh for food, for it is written, `Strong meat is for those who are of full age, for those who, by reason of their capacity, have their senses exercised[fn-92-P9244_3355920:20-nf] .' And further, when the word is sown it does not yield a uniform produce of fruit in this human life, but one various and rich; for it bringeth forth, some an hundred, and some sixty, and some thirty[fn-92-P9245_3356138:21-nf] , as the Saviour teaches-that Sower of grace, and Bestower of the Spirit[fn-92-P9246_3356618:22-nf] . And this is no doubtful matter, nor one that admits no confirmation; but it is in our power to behold the field which is sown by Him; for in the Church the word is manifold and the produce[fn-92-P9247_3356833:23-nf] rich. Not with virgins alone is such a field adorned; nor with monks alone but also with honourable matrimony and the chastity of each one. For in sowing, He did not compel the will beyond the power. Nor is mercy confined to the perfect, but it is sent down also among those who occupy the middle and the third ranks, so that He might rescue all men generally to salvation. To this intent He hath prepared many mansions[fn-92-P9248_3357322:24-nf] with the Father, so that although the dwelling-place is various in proportion to the advance in moral attainment, yet all of us are within the wall, and all of us enter within the same fence, the adversary being cast out, and all his host expelled thence.

And again, `Come, blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom which is prepared for you[fn-92-P9250_3357991:26-nf] .' So also the Spirit cried aforetime in the Psalms, saying, `Enter into His gates with psalms[fn-92-P9251_3358121:27-nf] .'

And this is the characteristic of those who fall away from the faith-to injure and persecute the faithful. The saints on the other hand, take such to themselves and look upon them as friends; as also the blessed David, using openness of speech, says, `Mine eyes are on the faithful of the earth, that they may dwell with me.' But those that are weak in the faith[fn-92-P9255_3359227:31-nf] , Paul urges that we should especially take to ourselves. For virtue is philanthropic[fn-92-P9256_3359342:32-nf] , just as in men of an opposite character, sin is misanthropic. So Saul, being a sinner, persecuted David, whereas David, though he had a goodopportunity, did not kill Saul. Esau too persecuted Jacob, while Jacob overcame his wickedness by meekness. And those eleven sold Joseph, but Joseph, in his loving-kindness, had pity on them.","title":"Letter X.

For this is the characteristic of those who go out from before God-to smite and to injure the men of God. And this is the characteristic of those who fall away from the faith-to injure and persecute the faithful. The saints on the other hand, take such to themselves and look upon them as friends; as also the blessed David, using openness of speech, says, `Mine eyes are on the faithful of the earth, that they may dwell with me.' But those that are weak in the faith[fn-92-P9255_3359227:31-nf] , Paul urges that we should especially take to ourselves. For virtue is philanthropic[fn-92-P9256_3359342:32-nf] , just as in men of an opposite character, sin is misanthropic. So Saul, being a sinner, persecuted David, whereas David, though he had a goodopportunity, did not kill Saul. Esau too persecuted Jacob, while Jacob overcame his wickedness by meekness. And those eleven sold Joseph, but Joseph, in his loving-kindness, had pity on them.","title":"Letter X.

For truly, my brethren, the course of the saints here is straitened; since they either toil painfully through longing for those things which are to come, as he who said, `Woe is me that my pilgrimage is prolonged[fn-93-P9307_3376944:11-nf] ;' or they are distressed and spent for the salvation of other men, as Paul wrote to the Corinthians, saying, `Lest, when I come to you, God should humble me, and I should bewail many of those who have sinned already, and not repented for the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed[fn-93-P9308_3377283:12-nf] .' As Samuel bewailed the destruction of Saul, and Jeremiah wept for the captivity of the people.

But those who turn to the Lordsh all have the veil taken away from them. What precise force all these things, however, may possess, I leave to the apprehension of those who have sound intelligence.

I have felt compelled to write to you in these terms, that you, may be on your guard against the mischief arising from bad teaching. If we may indeed liken pernicious teachings to poisonous drugs, as your dream-tellers have it. these doctrines are hemlock and monkshood, or any other deadly to man. It is these that destroy souls; not my words, as this shrieking drunken scum, full of the fancies of their condition, make out. If they bad any sense they ought to know that in souls, pure and cleansed from all defilement, the prophetic gift shines clear. In a foul mirror you cannot see what the reflexion is, neither can a soul preoccupied with cares of this life, and darkened with the passions of the lust of the flesh, receive the rays of the Holy Ghost. Every dream is not a prophecy, as says Zechariah. \"The Lord shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, ... for the idols have spoken vanity and the diviners have told false dreams.\"[fn-50-P5096_1595828:26-nf] Those who, as Isaiah says, dream and love to sleep in their bed[fn-50-P5097_1595912:27-nf] forget that an operation of error is sent to \"the children of disobedience.\"[fn-50-P5098_1596011:28-nf] And there is a lying spirit, which arose in false prophecies, and deceived Ahab.[fn-50-P5099_1596109:29-nf] Knowing this they ought not to have been so lifted up as to ascribe the gift of prophecy to themselves. They are shewn to fall far short even of the case of the seer Balaam; for Balaam when invited by the king of Moab with mighty bribes brooked not to utter a word beyond the will of God, nor to curse Israel whom the Lord cursed not.[fn-51-P5100_1596467:30-nf] If then their sleep-fancies do not tally with the commandments of the Lord, let them be content with the Gospels. The Gospels need no dreams to add to their credit. The Lord has sent His peace to us, and left us a new commandment, to love one another, but dreams bring strife and division and destruction of love. Let them therefore not give occasion to the devil to attack their souls in sleep; nor make their imaginations of more authority than the instruction of salvation.","title":"Letter CCX","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":2,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_33_letter_xxviii_to_flavian_commonly_called_the_tome_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Therefore in consequence of this unity of person which is to be understood in both natures[fn-11-P1124_265476:45-nf] , we read of the Son of Man also descending from heaven, when the Son of God took flesh from the Virgin who bore Him.

Nor has he any fear of the blessed apostle and evangelist John's declaration when he says, \"every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ to have come in the flesh, is of God: and every spirit which destroys Jesus is not of God, and this is Antichrist[fn-11-P1133_269885:54-nf] .\" But what is \"to destroy Jesus,\" except to take away the human nature from Him, and to render void the mystery, by which alone we were saved, by the most barefaced fictions. The truth is that being in darkness about the nature of Christ's body, he must also be befooled by the same blindness in the matter of His sufferings. For if he does not think the cross of the Lord fictitious, and does not doubt that the punishment He underwent to save the world is likewise true, let him acknowledge the flesh of Him whose death he already believes: and let him not disbelieve Him man with a body like ours, since he acknowledges Him to have been able to suffer: seeing that the denial of His true flesh is also the denial of His bodily suffering. If therefore he receives the Christian faith, and does not turn away his ears from the preaching of the Gospel: let him see what was the nature that hung pierced with nails on the wooden cross, and, when the side of the Crucified was opened by the soldier's spear, let him understand whence it was that blood and water flowed, that the Church of God might be watered from the font and from the cup[fn-11-P1134_271585:55-nf] . Let him hear also the blessed Apostle Peter, proclaiming that the sanctification of the Spirit takes place through the sprinkling of Christ's blood[fn-11-P1135_271924:56-nf] . And let him not read cursorily the same Apostle's words when he says, \"Knowing that not with corruptible things, such as silver and gold, have ye been redeemed from your vain manner of life which is part of your fathers' tradition, but with the precious blood of Jesus Christ as of a lamb without spot and blemish[fn-11-P1136_272279:57-nf] .\" Let him not resist too the witness of the blessed Apostle John, who says: \"and the blood of Jesus the Son of God cleanseth us from all sin[fn-11-P1137_272439:58-nf] .\" And again: \"this is the victory which overcometh the world, our faith.\" And \"who is He that overcometh the world save He that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God. This is He that came by water and blood, Jesus Christ: not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that testifieth, because the Spirit is the truth[fn-11-P1138_272797:59-nf] , because there are three that bear witness, the Spirit, the water and the blood, and the three are one[fn-11-P1139_273124:60-nf] .\" The Spirit, that is, of sanctification, and the blood of redemption, and the water of baptism: because the three are one, and remain undivided, and none of them is separated from this connection; because the catholic Church lives and progresses by this faith, so that in Christ Jesus neither the manhood without the true Godhead nor the Godhead without the true manhood is believed in.","title":"Letter XXVIII.

The cause of the rupture was the allegation that I wrote to Apollinarius and was in communion with the presbyter Diodorus. I never regarded Apollinarius as an enemy, and for some reasons I even respect him. But I never so far trotted myself to him as to take upon me the charges against him; indeed I have myself some accusations to bring against him after reading some of his books. I do not know that I ever asked him for a book on the Holy Spirit, or received it on his sending: I am told that he has become a most copious writer, but I have read very few of his works.[fn-56-P5656_1784219:10-nf] I have not even time to investigate such matters. Indeed I shrink from admitting any of the more recent works, for my health does not even allow of my reading the inspired Scriptures with diligence and as I ought. What, then, is it to me, if some one has written something displeasing to somebody else? Yet if one man is to render an account on behalf of another, let him who accuses me for Apollinarius' sake defend himself to me for the sake of Arius his own master and of Aetius his own disciple. I never learnt anything from, nor taught anything to this man whose guilt is laid at my door. Diodorus, as a nursling of the blessed Silvanus, I did receive from the beginning: I love him now and respect him on account of his grace of speech, whereby many who meet him are made the better men.[fn-56-P5657_1785227:11-nf] ","title":"Letter CCXLIV.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":2,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_283_letter_cclxv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"2. I have been specially moved to desire union with you by the report of the zeal of your reverences in the cause of orthodoxy. The constancy of your hearts has been stirred neither by multiplicity of books nor by variety of ingenious arguments. You have on the contrary, recognised those who endeavoured to introduce innovations in opposition to the apostolic doctrines, and you have refused to keep silence concerning the mischief which they are causing. I have in truth found great distress among all who cleave to the peace of the Lord at the divers innovations of Apollinarius of Laodicea. He has all the more distressed me from the fact that he seemed at the beginning on our side. A sufferer can in a certain sense endure what comes to him from an open enemy, even though it be exceedingly painful, as it is written, \"For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could bare borne it.\"[fn-59-P5953_1875408:2-nf] But it is intolerable, and beyond the power of comfort, to be wronged by a close and sympathetic friend. Now that very man whom I have expected to have at my right hand in defence of the truth, I have found in many ways hindering those who are being saved, by seducing their minds and drawing them away from direct doctrine. What rash and hasty deed has he not done? What ill considered and dangerous argument has he not risked? Is not all the Church divided against herself, specially since the day when men have been sent by him to the Churches governed by orthodox bishops, to rend them asunder and to set up some peculiar and illegal service? Is not ridicule brought upon the great mystery of true religion when bishops go about without people and clergy, having nothing but the mere name and title, and effecting nothing for the advancement of the Gospel of peace and salvation? Are not his discourses about God full of impious doctrines, the old impiety of the insane Sabellius being now renewed by him in his writings? For if the works which are current among the Sebastenes are not the forgery of foes, and are really his composition, he has reached a height of impiety which cannot be surpassed, in saying that Father, Son, and Spirit are the same, and other dark pieces of irreverence which I have declined even to hear, praying that I may have nothing to do with those who have uttered them. Does he not confuse the doctrine of the incarnation? Has not the oeconomy of salvation been made doubtful to the many on account of his dark and cloudy speculations about it? To collect them all, and refute them, requires long time and much discussion. But where have the promises of the Gospel been blunted and destroyed as by his figments? So meanly and poorly has he dared to explain the blessed hope laid up for all who live according to the Gospel of Christ, as to reduce it to mere old wives' fables and doctrines of Jews. He proclaims the renewal of the Temple, the observance of the worship of the Law, a typical high priest over again after the real High Priest, and a sacrifice for sins after the Lamb of God Who taketh away the sin of the world.[fn-59-P5954_1877583:3-nf] He preaches partial baptisms after the one baptism, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the Church which, through its faith in Christ, has not spot or wrinkle, or any such thing;[fn-59-P5955_1877778:4-nf] cleansing of leprosy after the painless state of the resurrection; an offering of jealousy[fn-59-P5956_1877884:5-nf] when they neither marry nor are given in marriage; shew-bread after the Bread from heaven; burning lamps after the true Light. In a word, if the law of the Commandments has been done away with by dogmas, it is plain that under these circumstances the dogmas of Christ will be nullified by the injunctions of the law.[fn-59-P5957_1878220:6-nf] At these things shame and disgrace have covered my face,[fn-59-P5958_1878395:7-nf] and heavy grief hath filled my heart. Wherefore, I beseech you, as skilful physicians, and instructed how to discipline antagonists with gentleness, to try and bring him back to the right order of the Church, and to persuade him to despise the wordiness of his own works; for he has proved the truth of the proverb \"in the multitude of words there wanteth not sin\"[fn-59-P5959_1878780:8-nf] Put boldly before him the doctrines of orthodoxy, in order that his amendment may be published abroad, and his repentance made known to his brethren.","title":"Letter CCLXV.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":2,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_64_letter_xlvi","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"2. You have flung away the yoke of that divine union; you have fled from the undefiled chamber of the true King; you have shamefully fallen into this disgraceful and impious corruption; and now that you cannot avoid this painful charge, and have no means or device to conceal your trouble, you rush into insolence. The wicked man after falling into a pit of iniquity always begins to despise, and you are denying your actual covenant with the true bridegroom; you say that you are not a virgin, and made no promise, although you have undertaken and publicly professed many pledges of virginity. Remember the good profession which you witnessed[fn-32-P3264_1070598:11-nf] before God, angels, and men. Remember the hallowed intercourse, the sacred company of virgins, the assembly of the Lord, the Church of the holy. Remember your grandmother, grown old in Christ, still youthful and vigorous in virtue; and your mother vying with her in the Lord, and striving to break with ordinary life in strange and unwonted toils; remember your sister, who copies their doings, nay, endeavours to surpass them, and goes beyond the good deeds of her fathers in her virgin graces, and earnestly challenges by word and deed you her sister, as she thinks, to like efforts, while she earnestly prays that your virginity be preserved.[fn-32-P3265_1071268:12-nf] All these call to mind, and your holy service of God with them, your life spiritual, though in the flesh; your conversation heavenly, though on earth. Remember days of calm, nights lighted up, spiritual songs, sweet music of psalms, saintly prayers, a bed pure and undefiled, procession of virgins, and moderate fare.[fn-32-P3266_1071729:13-nf] What has become of your grave appearance, your gracious demeanour, your plain dress, meet for a virgin, the beautiful blush of modesty, the comely and bright pallor due to temperance and vigils, shining fairer than any brilliance of complexion? How often have you not prayed, perhaps with tears, that you might preserve your virginity without spot! How often have you not written to the holy men, imploring them to offer up prayers in your behalf, not that it should be your lot to marry, still less to be involved in this shameful corruption, but that you should not fall away from the Lord Jesus? How often have you received gifts from the Bridegroom? Why enumerate the honours given you for His sake by them that are His? Why tell of your fellowship with virgins, your progress with them, your being greeted by them with praises on account of virginity, eulogies of virgins, letters written as to a virgin? Now, nevertheless, at a little blast from the spirit of the air, \"that now worketh in the children of disobedience,\"[fn-32-P3267_1072779:14-nf] you have abjured all these; you have changed the honourable treasure, worth fighting for at all costs, for short-lived indulgence which does! for the moment gratify the appetite; one day you will find it more bitter than gall.","title":"Letter XLVI","author":"St. Basil"}]
