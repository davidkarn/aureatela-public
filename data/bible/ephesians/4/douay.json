{"verses":["I therefore, a prisoner in the Lord, beseech you that you walk\nworthy of the vocation in which you are called:","With all humility and mildness, with patience, supporting one\nanother in charity.","Careful to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.","One body and one Spirit:  as you are called in one hope of your\ncalling.","One Lord, one faith, one baptism.","One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and\nin us all.","But to every one of us is given grace, according to the measure of\nthe giving of Christ.","Wherefore he saith:  Ascending on high, he led captivity captive:\nhe gave gifts to men.","Now that he ascended, what is it, but because he also descended\nfirst into the lower parts of the earth?","He that descended is the same also that ascended above all the\nheavens:  that he might fill all things.","And he gave some apostles, and some prophets, and other some\nevangelists, and other some pastors and doctors:","For the perfecting of the saints, for the word of the ministry,\nfor the edifying of the body of Christ:","Until we all meet into the unity of faith and of the knowledge of\nthe Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the age of the\nfulness of Christ:","That henceforth we be no more children tossed to and fro and\ncarried about with every wind of doctrine, by the wickedness of men, by\ncunning craftiness by which they lie in wait to deceive.","But doing the truth in charity, we may in all things grow up in\nhim who is the head, even Christ:","From whom the whole body, being compacted and fitly joined\ntogether, by what every joint supplieth, according to the operation in\nthe measure of every part, maketh increase of the body, unto the\nedifying of itself in charity.","This then I say and testify in the Lord:  That henceforward you\nwalk not as also the Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind:","Having their understanding darkened:  being alienated from the\nlife of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the\nblindness of their hearts.","Who despairing have given themselves up to lasciviousness, unto\nthe working of all uncleanness, unto covetousness.","But you have not so learned Christ:","If so be that you have heard him and have been taught in him, as\nthe truth is in Jesus:","To put off, according to former conversation, the old man, who is\ncorrupted according to the desire of error.","And be renewed in spirit of your mind:","And put on the new man, who according to God is created in\njustice and holiness of truth.","Wherefore, putting away lying, speak ye the truth, every man with\nhis neighbour.  For we are members one of another.","Be angry:  and sin not.  Let not the sun go down upon your anger.","Give not place to the devil.","He that stole, let him now steal no more:  but rather let him\nlabour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may\nhave something to give to him that suffereth need.","Let no evil speech proceed from your mouth:  but that which is\ngood, to the edification of faith:  that it may administer grace to the\nhearers.","And grieve not the holy Spirit of God:  whereby you are sealed\nunto the day of redemption.","Let all bitterness and anger and indignation and clamour and\nblasphemy be put away from you, with all malice.","And be ye kind one to another:  merciful, forgiving one another,\neven as God hath forgiven you in Christ."]}
