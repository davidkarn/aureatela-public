These men may have affected this austere mien to gain for themselves reputation and notoriety. For so long as we dwell in the tabernacle of this body and are enveloped with this fragile flesh, we can but restrain and regulate our affections and passions; we cannot wholly extirpate them. Knowing this the psalmist says: \"be ye angry and sin not;\"[fn-52-P5214_1433962:3732-nf] which the apostle explains thus: \"let not the sun go down upon your wrath.\"[fn-52-P5215_1434063:3733-nf] For, if to be angry is human, to put an end to one's anger is Christian.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":4,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1434","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"17. Men often discuss the comparative merits of life in solitude and life in a community; and the preference is usually given to the first over the second. Still even for men there is always the risk that, being withdrawn from the society of their fellows, they may become exposed to unclean and godless imaginations, and in the fulness of their arrogance and disdain may look down upon everyone but themselves, and may arm their tongues to detract from the clergy or from those who like themselves are bound by the vows of a solitary life.[fn-52-P5244_1445623:3756-nf] Of such it is well said by the psalmist, \"as for the children of men their teeth are spears and arrows and their tongue a sharp sword.\"[fn-52-P5245_1445786:3757-nf] Now if all this is true of men, how much more does it apply to women whose fickle and vacillating minds, if left to their own devices, soon degenerate. I am myself acquainted with anchorites of both sexes who by excessive fasting have so impaired their faculties that they do not know what to do or where to turn, when to speak or when to be silent. Most frequently those who have been so affected have lived in solitary cells, cold and damp. Moreover if persons untrained in secular learning read the works of able church writers, they only acquire from them a wordy fluency and not, as they might do, a fuller knowledge of the scriptures. The old saying is found true of them, although they have not the wit to speak, they cannot remain silent. They teach to others the scriptures that they do not understand themselves; and if they are fortunate enough to convince them, they take upon themselves airs as men of learning.[fn-52-P5246_1446733:3758-nf] In fact, they set up as instructors of the ignorant before they have gone to school themselves. It is a good thing therefore to defer to one's betters, to obey those set over one, to learn not only from the scriptures but from the example of others how one ought to order one's life, and not to follow that worst of teachers, one's own self-confidence. Of women who are thus presumptuous the apostle says that they \"are carried about with every wind of doctrine,[fn-52-P5247_1447234:3759-nf] ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.\"[fn-52-P5248_1447325:3760-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":4,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1466","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"4.

Therefore on this double death of ours our Saviour bestowed His own single death; and to cause both our resurrections, He appointed beforehand and set forth in mystery and type His own one resurrection. For He was not a sinner or ungodly, that, as though dead in spirit, He should need to be renewed in the inner man, and to be recalled as it were to the life of righteousness by repentance; but being clothed in mortal flesh, and in that alone dying, in that alone rising again, in that alone did He answer to both for us; since in it was wrought a mystery as regards the inner man, and a type as regards the outer. For it was in a mystery as regards our inner man, so as to signify the death of our soul, that those words were uttered, not only in the Psalm, but also on the cross: \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\"[fn-8-P841_325461:25-nf] To which words the apostle agrees, saying, \"Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin;\" since by the crucifixion of the tuner man are understood the pains of repentance, and a certain wholesome agony of self-control, by which death the death of ungodliness is destroyed, and in which death God has left us. And so the body of sin is destroyed through such a cross, that now we should not yield our members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin.[fn-8-P842_326043:26-nf] Because, if even the inner man certainly is renewed day by day,[fn-8-P843_326128:27-nf] yet undoubtedly it is old before it is renewed. For that is done inwardly of which the same apostle speaks: \"Put off the old man, and put on the new;\" which he goes on to explain by saying, \"Wherefore, putting away lying, speak every man truth.\"[fn-8-P844_326394:28-nf] But where is lying put away, unless inwardly, that he who speaketh the truth from his heart may inhabit the holy hill of God?[fn-8-P845_326541:29-nf] But the resurrection of the body of the Lord is shown to belong to the mystery of our own inner resurrection, where, after He had risen, He says to the woman, \"Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father;\"[fn-8-P846_326775:30-nf] with which mystery the apostle's words agree, where he says, \"If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God; set your thoughts[fn-8-P847_326988:31-nf] on things above.\"[fn-8-P848_327019:32-nf] For not to touch Christ, unless when He had ascended to the Father, means not to have thoughts[fn-8-P849_327135:33-nf] of Christ after a fleshly manner. Again, the death of the flesh of our Lord contains a type of the death of our outer man, since it is by such suffering most of all that He exhorts His servants that they should not fear those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul.[fn-8-P850_327429:34-nf] Wherefore the apostle says, \"That I may fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh.\"[fn-8-P851_327559:35-nf] And the resurrection of the body of the Lord is found to contain a type of the resurrection of our outward man, because He says to His disciples, \"Handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.\"[fn-8-P852_327802:36-nf] And one of the disciples also, handling His scars, exclaimed, \"My Lord and my God!\"[fn-8-P853_327907:37-nf] And whereas the entire integrity of that flesh was apparent, this was shown in that which He had said when exhorting His disciples: \"There shall not a hair of your head perish.\"[fn-8-P854_328104:38-nf] For how comes it that first is said, \"Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father;\"[fn-8-P855_328216:39-nf] and how comes it that before He ascends to the Father, He actually is touched by the disciples: unless because in the former the mystery of the inner man was intimated, in the latter a type was given of the outer man? Or can any one possibly be so without understanding, and so turned away from the truth, as to dare to saythat He was touched by men before He ascended, but by women when He had ascended? It was on account of this type, which went before in the Lord, of our future resurrection in the body, that the apostle says, \"Christ the first-fruits; afterward they that are Christ's.\"[fn-8-P856_328826:40-nf] For it was the resurrection of the body to which this place refers, on account of which he also says, \"Who has changed our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body.\"[fn-8-P857_329035:41-nf] The one death therefore of our Saviour brought salvation to our double death, and His one resurrection wrought for us two resurrections; since His body in both cases, that is, both in His death and in His resurrection, wasministered to us by a kind of healing suitableness, both as a mystery of the inner man, and as a type of the outer.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_10_book_iv_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"56","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"17. Because that deceiver then,-who was a mediator to death for man, and feignedly puts himself forward as to life, under the name of cleansing by sacrilegious rites and sacrifices, by which the proud are led away, -can neither share in our death, nor rise again from his own: he has indeed been able to apply his single death to our double one; but he certainly has not been able to apply a single resurrection, which should be at once a mystery of our renewal, and a type of that waking up which is to be in the end. He then who being alive in the spirit raised again His own flesh that was dead, the true Mediator of life, has cast out him, who is dead in the spirit and the mediator of death, from the spirits of those who believe in Himself, so that he should not reign within, But should assault from without, and yet not prevail. And to him, too, He offered Himself to be tempted, in order that He might be also a mediator to overcome his temptations, not only by succor, but also by example. But when the devil, from the first, although striving through every entrance to creep into His inward parts, was thrust out, having finished all his alluring temptation in the wilderness after the baptism;[fn-9-P923_353883:75-nf] because, being dead in the spirit, he forced no entrance into Him who was alive in the spirit, he betook himself, through eagerness for the death of man in any way whatsoever, to effecting that deathwhich he could, and was permitted to effect it upon that mortal element which the living Mediator had received from us. And where he could do anything, there in every respect he was conquered; and wherein he received outwardly the power of slaying the Lord in the flesh, therein his inward power, by which he held ourselves, was slain. For it was brought to pass that the bonds of many sins in many deaths were loosed, through the one death of One which no sin had preceded. Which death, though not due, the Lord therefore rendered for us, that the death which was due might work us no hurt. For He was not stripped of the flesh by obligation of any authority, but He stripped Himself. For doubtless He who was able not to die, if He would not, did die because He would: and so He made a show of principalities and powers, openly triumphing over them in Himself.[fn-9-P924_354965:76-nf] For whereas by His death the one and most real sacrifice was offered up for us, whatever fault there was, whence principalities and powers held us fast as of right to pay its penalty, He cleansed, abolished, extinguished; and by His own resurrection He also called us whom He predestinated to a new life; and whom He called, them He justified; and whom He justified, them He glorified.[fn-9-P925_355369:77-nf] And so the devil, in that very death of the flesh, lost man, whom he was possessing as by an absolute right, seduced as he was by his own consent, and over whom he ruled, himself impeded by no corruption of flesh and blood, through that frailty of man's mortal body, whence he was both too poor and too weak; he who was proud in proportion as he was, as it were, both richer and stronger, ruling over him who was, as it were, both clothed in rags and full of troubles. For whither he drove the sinner to fall, himself not following, there by following he compelled the Redeemer to descend. And so the Son of God deigned to become our friend in the fellowship of death, to which because he came not, the enemy thought himself to be better and greater than ourselves. For our Redeemer says, \"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\"[fn-9-P926_356262:78-nf] Wherefore also the devil thought himself superior to the Lord Himself, inasmuch as the Lord in His sufferings yielded to him; for of Him, too, is understood what is read in the Psalm, \"For Thou hast made Him a little lower than the angels:\"[fn-9-P927_356521:79-nf] so that He, being Himself put to death, although innocent, by the unjust one acting against us as it were by just right, might by a most just right overcome him, and so might lead captive the captivity wrought through sin,[fn-9-P928_356762:80-nf] and free us from a captivity that was just on account of sin, by blotting out the handwriting, and redeeming us who were to be justified although sinners, through His own righteous blood unrighteously poured out.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_06_book_i_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"62","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"Inasmuch as the Catholic Church is one body, and we are commanded in the holy Scriptures to maintain `the bond of unity and peace,'[fn-2-P213_53825:13-nf] it becomes us to write, and mutually acquaint one another with the condition of things among each of us, in order that `if one member suffers or rejoices, we may either sympathize with each other, or rejoice together.'[fn-2-P214_54061:14-nf] Know therefore that there have recently arisen in our diocese lawless and anti-christian men, teaching apostasy such as one may justly consider and denominate the forerunner of Antichrist. I wished indeed to consign this disorder to silence, that if possible the evil might be confined to the apostates alone, and not go forth into other districts and contaminate the ears of some of the simple. But since Eusebius, now in Nicomedia, thinks that the affairs of the Church are under his control because, forsooth, he deserted his charge at Berytus and assumed authority over the Church at Nicomedia with impunity, and has put himself at the head of these apostates, daring oven to send commendatory letters in all directions concerning them, if by any means he might inveigle some of the ignorant into this most impious and anti-christian heresy, I felt imperatively called on to be silent no longer, knowing what is written in the law, but to inform you of all of these things, that ye might understand both who the apostates are, and also the contemptible character of their heresy, and pay no attention to anything that Eusebius should write to you. For now wishing to renew his former malevolence, which seemed to have been buried in oblivion by time, he affects to write in their behalf; while the fact itself plainly shows that he does this for the promotion of his own purposes. These then are those who have become apostates: Arius, Achillas Aithales, and Carpones, another Arius, Sarmates, Euzoïus, Lucius Julian, Menas, Helladis, and Gaius; with these also must be reckoned Secundus and Theonas, who once were called bishops. The dogmas they have invented and assert, contrary to the Scriptures, are these: That God was not always the Father, but that there was a period when he was not the Father; that the Word of God was not from eternity but was made out of nothing;[fn-2-P215_55963:15-nf] for that the ever-existing God (`the I AM'-the eternal One) made him who did not previously exist, out of nothing; wherefore there was a time when he did not exist, inasmuch as the Son is a creature and a work. That he is neither like the Father as it regards his essence, nor is by nature either the Fathers true Word, or true Wisdom, but indeed one of his works and creatures, being erroneously called Word and Wisdom, since he was himself made of God's own Word and the Wisdom which is in God, whereby God both made all things and him also. Wherefore he is as to his nature mutable and susceptible of change, as all other rational creatures are: hence the Word is alien to and other than the essence of God; and the Father is inexplicable by the Son, and invisible to him, for neither does the Word perfectly and accurately know the Father, neither can he distinctly see him. The Son knows not the nature of his own essence: for he was made on our account, in order that God might create us by him, as by an instrument; nor would he ever have existed, unless God had wished to create us.","title":"Book I.","author":"Socrates Scholasticus"},{"chapter":4,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_05_procatechesis","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"14","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"7.

Certainly the apostle[fn-7-P705_294285:57-nf] expressly called the rulers and governors among men creature, when he said, \"Submit yourselves to every human creature for the Lord's sake; whether to the king as supreme, or to governors as those sent by him.\" The prophet also[fn-7-P706_294533:58-nf] when he says, \"Prepare, Israel, to invoke thy God.

For God did not then create the Spirit, when he declared his Christ to all men, since[fn-7-P707_294881:59-nf] \"There is nothing new under the sun\"; but the Spirit existed, and had being previously: but he was sent at what time the apostles were gathered together, when like thunder \"There came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind; and they were filled with the Holy Spirit.\"[fn-7-P708_295175:60-nf] And thus they declared unto all men the Christ of God, in accordance with that prophecy which says,[fn-7-P709_295304:61-nf] \"Behold he who confirms the thunder, creates the Spirit, and announces his Christ unto men\": the word \"creates\" being used instead of \"sends down,\" or appoints; and thunder in another figure implying the preaching of the Gospel. Again he that says, \"Create in me a clean heart, O God,\"[fn-7-P710_295608:62-nf] said not this as if he had no heart; but prayed that his mind might be purified.

Wherefore, one should not be surprised if in this passage, \"The Lord created me the beginning of his ways,\" the term \"created\" is used metaphorically, instead of \"appointed\" or constituted.'Such words Eusebius uses in his work against Marcellus; we have quoted them on account of those who have slanderously attempted to traduce and criminate him. Neither can they prove that Eusebius attributes a beginning of subsistence to the Son of God, although they may find him often using the expressions by accommodation; and especially so, because he · was an emulator and admirer of the works of Origen, in which those who are able to comprehend the depth of Origen's writings, will perceive it to be everywhere stated that the Son was begotten of the Father.

For whether He is the unity of both, or the holiness, or the love, or therefore the unity because the love, and therefore the love because the holiness, it is manifest that He is not one of the two, through whom the two are joined, through whom the Begotten is loved by the Begetter, and loves Him that begat Him, and through whom, not by participation, but by their own essence, neither by the gift of any superior, but by their own, they are \"keeping the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace;\"[fn-11-P1131_465485:10-nf] which we are commanded to imitate by grace, both towards God and towards ourselves. \"On which two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\"[fn-11-P1132_465650:11-nf] So those three are God, one, alone, great, wise, holy, blessed. But we are blessed from Him, and through Him, and in Him; because we ourselves are one by His gift, and one spirit with Him, because our soul cleaves to Him so as to follow Him. And it is good for us to cleave to God, since He will destroy every man who is estranged from Him.[fn-11-P1133_466015:12-nf] Therefore the Ho!y Spirit, whatever it is, is something common both to the Father and Son. But that communion itself is consubstantial and co-eternal; and if it may fitly be called friendship, let it be so called; but it is more aptly called love. And this is also a substance, since God is a substance, and \"God is love,\" as it is written.[fn-11-P1134_466381:13-nf] But as He is a substance together with the Father and the Son, so that substance is together with them great, and together with them good, and together with them holy, and whatsoever else is said in reference to substance; since it is not one thing to God to be, and another to be great or to be good. and the rest, as we have shown above. For if love is less great therein [i.e. in God] than wisdom, then wisdom is loved in less degree than according to what it is; love is therefore equal, in order that wisdom may be loved according to its being; but wisdom is equal with the Father, as we have proved above; therefore also the Holy Spirit is equal; and if equal, equal in all things, off account of the absolute simplicity which is in that substance.

They who refuse to allow that the Father pervades all things do not so much as maintain the logical sequence of thought in their argument. The faith of the sound is that God fills all things;[fn-12-P1257_297752:88-nf] but they who divide their up and down between the Father and the Son do not remember even the word of the Prophet: \"If I climb up into heaven thou art there; if I go down to hell thou art there also.\"[fn-12-P1258_298350:89-nf] Now, to omit all proof of the ignorance of those who predicate place of incorporeal things, what excuse can be found for their attack upon Scripture, shameless as their antagonism is, in the passages \"Sit thou on my right hand \"[fn-12-P1259_298597:90-nf] and \"Sat down on the right hand of the majesty of God\"?[fn-12-P1260_298678:91-nf] The expression \"right hand\" does not, as they contend, indicate the lower place, but equality of relation; it is not understood physically, in which case there might be something sinister about God,[fn-12-P1261_298893:92-nf] but Scripture puts before us the magnificence of the dignity of the Son by the use of dignified language indicating the seat of honour.

The dispensation of our God and Saviour concerning man is a recall from the fall and a return from the alienation caused by disobedience to close communion with God. This is the mason for the sojourn of Christ in the flesh, the pattern life described in the Gospels, the sufferings, the cross, the tomb, the resurrection; so that the man who is being saved through imitation of Christ receives that old adoption. For perfection of life the imitation of Christ is necessary, not only in the example of gentleness,[fn-15-P1524_371731:298-nf] lowliness, and long suffering set us in His life, but also of His actual death. So Paul, the imitator of Christ,[fn-15-P1525_371865:299-nf] says, \"being made conformable unto his death; if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-15-P1526_372254:300-nf] How then are we made in the likeness of His death?[fn-15-P1527_372330:301-nf] In that we were buried[fn-15-P1528_372379:302-nf] with Him by baptism. What then is the manner of the burial? And what is the advantage resulting from the imitation? First of all, it is necessary that the continuity of the old life be cut. And this is impossible less a man be born again, according to the Lord's word;[fn-15-P1529_372670:303-nf] for the regeneration, as indeed the name shews, is a beginning of a second life. So before beginning the second, it is necessary to put an end to the first. For just as in the case of runners who turn and take the second course,[fn-15-P1530_372956:304-nf] a kind of halt and pause intervenes between the movements in the opposite direction, so also inmaking a change in lives it seemed necessary for death to come as mediator between the two, ending all that goes before, and beginning all that comes after. How then do we achieve the descent into hell? By imitating, through baptism, the burial of Christ. For the bodies of the baptized are, as it were, buried in the water. Baptism then symbolically signifies the putting off of the works of the flesh; as the apostle says, ye were \"circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ; buried with him in baptism.\" And there is, as it were, a cleansing of the soul from the filth[fn-15-P1531_373733:305-nf] that has grown on it from the carnal mind,[fn-15-P1532_373982:306-nf] as it is written, \"Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.\"[fn-15-P1533_374080:307-nf] On this account we do not, as is the fashion of the Jews, wash ourselves at each defilement, but own the baptism of salvation[fn-15-P1534_374233:308-nf] to be one.[fn-15-P1535_374337:309-nf] For there the death on behalf of the world is one, and one the resurrection of the dead, whereof baptism is a type. For this cause the Lord, who is the Dispenser of our life, gave us the covenant of baptism, containing a type of life and death, for the water fulfils the image of death, and the Spirit gives us the earnest of life. Hence it follows that the answer to our question why the water was associated with the Spirit[fn-15-P1536_374781:310-nf] is clear: the reason is because in baptism two ends were proposed; on the one hand, the destroying of the body of sin,[fn-15-P1537_374927:311-nf] that it may never bear fruit unto death;[fn-15-P1538_374991:312-nf] on the other hand, our living unto the Spirit,[fn-15-P1539_375062:313-nf] and having our fruit in holiness;[fn-15-P1540_375119:314-nf] the water receiving the body as in a tomb figures death, while the Spirit pours in the quickening power, renewing our souls from the deadness of sin unto their original life. This then is what it is to be born again of water and of the Spirit, the being made dead being effected in the water, while our life is wrought in us through the Spirit. In three immersions,[fn-15-P1541_375509:315-nf] then, and with three invocations, the great mystery of baptism is performed, to the end that the type of death may be fully figured, and that by the tradition of the divine knowledge the baptized may have their souls enlightened. It follows that if there is any grace in the water, it is not of the nature of the water, but of the presence of the Spirit. For baptism is \"not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towards God.\"[fn-15-P1542_376000:316-nf] So in training us for the life that follows on the resurrection the Lord sets out all the manner of life required by the Gospel, laying down for us the law of gentleness, of endurance of wrong, of freedom from the defilement that comes of the love of pleasure, and from covetousness, to the end that we may of set purpose win beforehand and achieve all that the life to come of its inherent nature possesses. If therefore any one in attempting a definition were to describe the gospel as a forecast of the life that follows on the resurrection, he would not seem to me to go beyond what is meet and right. Let us now return to our main topic.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":4,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"126","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"40. Moreover by any one who carefully uses his reason it will be found that even at the moment of the expected appearance of the Lord from heaven the Holy Spirit will not, as some suppose, have no functions to discharge: on the contrary, even in the day of His revelation, in which the blessed and only potentate[fn-15-P1593_394396:359-nf] will judge the world in righteousness,[fn-15-P1594_394458:360-nf] the Holy Spirit will be present with Him. For who is so ignorant of the good things prepared by God for them that are worthy. as not to know that the crown of the righteous is the grace of the Spirit, bestowed in more abundant and perfect measure in that day, when spiritual glory shall be distributed to each in proportion as he shall have nobly played the man? For among the glories of the saints are \"many mansions\" in the Father's house,[fn-15-P1595_394927:361-nf] that is differences of dignities: for as \"star differeth from star in glory, so also is the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-15-P1596_395068:362-nf] They, then, that were sealed by the Spirit unto the day of redemption,[fn-15-P1597_395161:363-nf] and preserve pure anti undiminished the first fruits which they received of the Spirit, are they that shall hear the words\"well done thou good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things.\"[fn-15-P1598_395540:364-nf] In like manner they which have grieved the Holy Spirit by the wickedness of their ways, or have not wrought for Him that gave to them, shall be deprived of what they have received, their grace being transferred to others; or, according to one of the evangelists, they shall even be wholly cut asunder,[fn-15-P1599_395868:365-nf] -the cutting asunder meaning complete separation from the Spirit. The body is not divided, part being delivered to chastisement, and part let off; for when a whole has sinned it were like the old fables, and unworthy of a righteous judge, for only the half to suffer chastisement. Nor is the soul cut in two,-that soul the whole of which possesses the sinful affection throughout, and works the wickedness in co-operation with the body. The cutting asunder, as I have observed, is the separation for aye of the soul from the Spirit. For now, although the Spirit does not suffer admixture with the unworthy, He nevertheless does seem in a manner to be present with them that have once been sealed, awaiting the salvation which follows on their conversion; but then He will be wholly cut off from the soul that has defiled His grace. For this reason \"In Hell there is none that maketh confession; in death none that remembereth God,\"[fn-16-P1600_396824:366-nf] because the succour of the Spirit is no longer present. How then is it possible to conceive that the judgment is accomplished without the Holy Spirit, wherein the word points out that He is Himself the prize[fn-16-P1601_397054:367-nf] of the righteous, when instead of the earnest[fn-16-P1602_397124:368-nf] is given that which is perfect, and the first condemnation of sinners, when they are deprived of that which they seem to have? But the greatest proof of the conjunction of the Spirit with the Father and the Son is that He is said to have the same relation to God which the spirit in us has to each of us. \"For what man\" it is said, \"knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God.\"[fn-16-P1603_397764:369-nf] ","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":4,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"145","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"50. But, it is said that \"He maketh intercession for us.\"[fn-16-P1691_431148:435-nf] It follows then that, as the suppliant is inferior to the benefactor, so far is the Spirit inferior in dignity to God. But have you never heard concerning the Only-begotten that He \"is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us\"?[fn-16-P1692_431421:436-nf] Do not, then, because the Spirit is in you,-if indeed He is at all in you,-nor yet because He teaches us who were blinded, and guides us to the choice of what profits us,-do not for this reason allow yourself to be deprived of the right and holy opinion concerning Him. For to make the loving kindness of your benefactor a ground of ingratitude were indeed a very extravagance of unfairness. \"Grieve not the Holy Spirit;\"[fn-16-P1693_431877:437-nf] hear the words of Stephen, the first fruits of the martyrs, when he reproaches the people for their rebellion and disobedience; \"you do always,\" he says,\"resist the Holy Ghost;\"[fn-16-P1694_432081:438-nf] and again Isaiah,-\"They vexed His Holy Spirit, therefore He was turned to be their enemy;\"[fn-16-P1695_432193:439-nf] and in another passage, \"the house of Jacob angered the Spirit of the Lord.\"[fn-16-P1696_432290:440-nf] Are not these passages indicative of authoritative power? I leave it to the judgment of my readers to determine what opinions we ought to hold when we hear these passages; whether we are to regard the Spirit as an instrument, a subject, of equal rank with the creature, and a fellow servant of ourselves, or whether, on the contrary, to the ears of the pious the mere whisper of this blasphemy is not most grievous. Do you call the Spirit a servant? But, it is said, \"the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth,\"[fn-16-P1697_432824:441-nf] and yet the Spirit knoweth the things of God, as \"the spirit of man that is in him.\"[fn-16-P1698_432931:442-nf] Chapter XX.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":4,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_01_npnf1_01_13_book_v_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"32","folder":"NPNF1-01","text":"9.

There is a caution in Leviticus: \"My priests shall not pluralize marriages.\"[fn-10-P1002_249840:33-nf] I may affirm even that that is plural which is not once for all. That which is not unity is number. In short, after unity begins number. Unity, moreover, is everything which is once for all.

Are not even we laics priests? It is written: \"A kingdom also, and priests to His God and Father, hath He made us.\"[fn-10-P1006_250960:37-nf] It is the authority of the Church, and the honour which has acquired sanctity through the joint session of the Order, which has established the difference between the Order and the laity. Accordingly, where there is no joint session of the ecclesiastical Order, you offer, and baptize, and are priest, alone for yourself. But where three are, a church is, albeit they be laics. For each individual lives by his own faith,[fn-10-P1007_251398:38-nf] nor is there exception of persons with God; since it is not hearers of the law who are justified by the Lord, but doers, according to what the apostle withal says.[fn-10-P1008_251621:39-nf] Therefore, if you have the right of a priest in your own person, in cases of necessity, it behoves you to have likewise the discipline of a priest whenever it may be necessary to have the fight of a priest. If you are a digamist, do you baptize? If you are a digamist, do you offer? How much more capital (a crime) is it for a digamist laic to act as a priest, when the priest himself, if he turn digamist, is deprived of the power of acting the priest! \"But to necessity,\" you say, \"indulgence is granted.\" No necessity is excusable which is avoidable. In a word, shun to be found guilty of digamy, and you do not expose yourself to the necessity of administering what a digamist may not lawfully administer. God wills us all to he so conditioned, as to be ready at all times and places to undertake (the duties of) His sacraments. There is \"one God, one faith,\"[fn-10-P1009_252556:40-nf] one discipline too. So truly is this the case, that unless the laics as well observe the rules which are to guide the choice of presbyters, how will there be presbyters at all, who are chosen to that office from among the laics?

For they fail to observe that menseverally become sons of God when they begin to live in newness of spirit, and to be renewed as to the inner manafter the image of Him that created them.[fn-7-P798_481373:46-nf] For it is not from the moment of a man's baptism that all his old infirmity is destroyed, but renovation begins with the remission of all his sins, and so far as he who is now wise is spiritually wise. All things else, however, are accomplished in hope, looking forward to their being also realized in fact,[fn-7-P799_481704:47-nf] even to the renewal of the body itself in that better state of immortality and incorruption with which we shall be clothed at the resurrection of the dead. For this too the Lord calls a regeneration,-though, of course, not such as occurs through baptism, but still a regeneration wherein that which is now begun in the spirit shall be brought to perfection also in the body. \"In the regeneration,\" says He, \"when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.\"[fn-8-P800_482277:48-nf] For however entire and full be the remission of sins in baptism, nevertheless, if there was wrought by it at once, an entire and full change of the man into his everlasting newness,-I do not mean change in his body, which is now most clearly tending evermore to the old corruption and to death, after which it is to be renewed into a total and true newness,-but, the body being excepted, if in the soul itself, which is the inner man, a perfect renewal was wrought in baptism, the apostle would not say: \"Even though our outward man perishes, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.\"[fn-8-P801_482884:49-nf] Now, undoubtedly, he who is still renewed day by day is not as yet wholly renewed; and in so far as he is not yet wholly renewed, he is still in his old state. Since, then, men, even after they are baptized, are still in some degree in their old condition, they are on that account also still children of the world; but inasmuch as they are also admitted into a new state, that is to say, by the full and perfect remission of their sins, and in so far as they are spiritually-minded, and behave correspondingly, they are the children of God.

And yet made it was, since we were then actually saved; for \"He saved us by the laver of regeneration.\"[fn-8-P803_484070:51-nf] In another passage, however, he tells us how this took place. \"Not they only,\" says he, \"but ourselves also, which have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.

They were founded probably at a very early period, but were greatly enlarged and augmented by a devout man whose name was Ammoun. In his youth this person had an aversion to matrimony; but when some of his relatives urged him not to contemn marriage, but to take a wife to himself, he was prevailed upon and was married. On leading the bride with the customary ceremonies from the banquet-room to the nuptial couch, after their mutual friends had withdrawn, he took a book[fn-13-P1390_599387:50-nf] containing the epistles of the apostles and read to his wife Paul's Epistle to the Corinthians, explaining to her the apostle's admonitions to married persons.[fn-13-P1391_599873:51-nf] Adducing many external considerations besides, he descanted on the inconveniences and discomforts attending matrimonial intercourse, the pangs of child-bearing, and the trouble and anxiety connected with rearing a family. He contrasted with all this the advantages of chastity; described the liberty, and immaculate purity of a life of continence; and affirmed that virginity places persons in the nearest relation to the Deity. By these and other arguments of a similar kind, he persuaded his virgin bride to renounce with him a secular life, prior to their having any conjugal knowledge of each other. Having taken this resolution, they retired together to the mountain of Nitria, and in a hut there inhabited for a short time one common ascetic apartment, without regarding their difference of sex, being according to the apostles, `one in Christ.'[fn-13-P1392_600750:52-nf] But not long after, the recent and unpolluted bride thus addressed Ammoun: `It is unsuitable,' said she, `for you who practice chastity, to look upon a woman in so confined a dwelling; let us therefore, if it is agreeable to you, perform our exercise apart.' This agreement again was satisfactory to both, and so they separated, and spent the rest of their lives in abstinence from wine and oil, eating dry bread alone, sometimes passing over one day, at others fasting two, and sometimes more. Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, asserts in his Life of Anthony,[fn-13-P1393_601461:53-nf] that the subject of his memoir who was contemporary with this Ammoun, saw his soul taken up by angels after his decease. Accordingly, a great number of persons emulated Ammoun's manner of life, so that by degrees the mountains of Nitria and Scitis were filled with monks, an account of whose lives would require an express work. As, however, there were among them persons of eminent piety, distinguished for their strict discipline and apostolic lives, who said and did many things worthy of being recorded, I deem it useful to interweave with my history a few particulars selected out of the great number for the information of my readers. It is said that Ammoun never saw himself naked, being accustomed to say that `it became not a monk to see even his own person exposed.' And when once he wanted to pass a river, but was unwilling to undress, he besought God to enable him to cross without his being obliged to break his resolution; and immediately an angel transported him to the other side of the river. Another monk named Didymus[fn-13-P1394_602529:54-nf] lived entirely alone to the day of his death, although he had reached the age of ninety years. Arsenius, another of them, would not separate young delinquents from communion, but only those that were advanced in age: `for,' said he, `when a young person is excommunicated he becomes hardened; but an elderly one is soon sensible of the misery of excommunication.' Pior was accustomed to take his food as he walked along. As a certain one asked him, `Why do you eat thus?' `That I may not seem,' said he, `to make eating serious business but rather a thing done by the way.' To another putting the same question he replied, `Lest even in eating my mind should be sensible of corporeal enjoyment.' Isidore affirmed that he had not been conscious of sin even in thought for forty years; and that he had never consented either to lust or anger. Pambos being an illiterate man went to some one for the purpose of being taught a psalm; and having heard the first verse of the thirty-eighth psalm, `I said I will take heed to my ways, that I offend not with my tongue,'[fn-13-P1395_603612:55-nf] he departed without staying to hear the second verse, saying, `this one will suffice, if I can practically acquire it.' And when the person who had given him the verse reproved him because he had not seen him for the space of six months, he answered that he had not yet learnt to practice the verse of the psalm. After a considerable lapse of time, being asked by one of his friends whether he had made himself master of the verse, his answer was, `I have scarcely succeeded in accomplishing it during nineteen years.' A certain individual having placed gold in his hands for distribution to the poor, requested him to reckon what he had given him. `There is no need of counting,' said he, `but of integrity of mind.' This same Pambos, at the desire of Athanasius the bishop, came out of the desert to Alexandria and on beholding an actress there, he wept. When those present asked him why he wept, he replied, `Two causes have affected me: one is the destruction of this woman; the other is that I exert myself less to please my God than she does to please obscene characters.' Another said that `a monk who did not work ought to be regarded as on a level with the covetous man.' Piterus was well-informed in many branches of natural philosophy, and was accustomed frequently to enter into expositions of the principles sometimes of one and sometimes of another department of science, but he always commenced his expositions with prayer. There were also among the monks of that period, two of the same name, of great sanctity, each being called Macarius; one of whom was from Upper Egypt, the other from the city of Alexandria. Both were celebrated for their ascetic discipline, the purity of their life and conversation, and the miracles which were wrought by their hands. The Egyptian Macarius performed so many cures, and cast out so many devils, that it would require a distinct treatise to record all that the grace of God enabled him to do. His manner toward those who resorted to him was austere, yet at the same time calculated to inspire veneration. The Alexandrian Macarius, while in all respects resembling his Egyptian namesake, differed from him in this, that he was always cheerful to his visitors; and by the affability of his manners led many young men to asceticism. Evagrius[fn-13-P1396_605933:56-nf] became a disciple of these men, acquired from them the philosophy of deeds, whereas he had previously known that which consisted in words only. He was ordained deacon at Constantinople by Gregory of Nazianzus, and afterwards went with him into Egypt, where he became acquainted with these eminent persons, and emulated their course of conduct, and miracles were done by his hands as numerous and important as those of his preceptors. Books were also composed by him of very valuable nature, one of which is entitled The Monk, or, On Active Virtue; another The Gnostic,[fn-13-P1397_606654:57-nf] or, To him who is deemed worthy of Knowledge: this book is divided into fifty chapters. A third is designated Antirrheticus, and contains selections from the Holy Scriptures against tempting spirits, distributed into eight parts, according to the number of the arguments. He wrote moreover Six Hundred Prognostic Problems, and also two compositions in verse, one addressed To the Monks living in Communities, and the other To the Virgin. Whoever shall read these productions will be convinced of their excellence. It will not be out of place here, I conceive, to subjoin to what has been before stated, a few things mentioned by him respecting the monks. These are his words:[fn-13-P1398_607409:58-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Socrates Scholasticus"},{"chapter":4,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_09_book_iv_","source_chapter":31,"source_paragraph":"142","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"About the same time it happened that[fn-14-P1464_640469:94-nf] another event took place at Milan well worthy of being recorded.

If any man demand what meaning we attach to this conclusion, he, as well as we, has read the words of the Apostle, Because ye are sons of God, God hath sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father[fn-11-P1104_670957:63-nf] , and Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, in Whom ye have been sealed[fn-11-P1105_671043:64-nf] , and again, But we have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we may know the things that are given unto us by God[fn-11-P1106_671215:65-nf] , and also But ye are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God is in you.

According to this difference of sins, the condition of repentance also is discriminated. There will be a condition which may possibly obtain pardon,-in the case, namely, of a remissible sin: there will be a condition which can by no means obtain it,-in the case, namely, of an irremissible sin. And it remains to examine specially, with regard to the position of adultery and fornication, to which class of sins they ought to be assigned.","title":"VII.

Buried with Him, then, we have been, through the baptism into the death, in order that, as Christ hath risen again from the dead, so we too may walk in newness of life. For if we have been buried together in the likeness of His death, why, we shall be (in that) of (His) resurrection too; knowing this, that our old man hath been crucified together with Him. But if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall live, too, with Him; knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, no more dieth, (that) death no more hath domination over Him.

Paucity is cast into the shade by multitude, doubt by certainty, obscurity by plainness. Even if, for certain, the apostle had granted pardon of fornication to that Corinthian, it would be another instance of his once for all contravening his own practice to meet the requirement of the time.

And there are diversities of operations, but the same God who worketh all things in all.

And a still more excellent way shew I unto you.\" And after discoursing more in detail of the graces of charity, he added:[fn-68-P6824_2166593:207-nf] \"Whether there be prophecies, they shall be done away; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall be done away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part: but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.\" And afterwards we read:[fn-68-P6825_2166957:208-nf] \"But now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love. Follow after love; yet desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.\" And again:[fn-68-P6826_2167182:209-nf] \"I would have you all speak with tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy: and greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues.\" And again:[fn-68-P6827_2167365:210-nf] \"I thank God, I speak with tongues more than you all.\" Where there are different gifts, and one man is greater, another less, and all are called spiritual, they are all certainly sheep, and they stand on the right hand; but there is a difference between one sheep and another. It is humility that leads the Apostle Paul to say:[fn-68-P6828_2167716:211-nf] \"I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not found vain: but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.\" But the very fact of his thus humbling himself shows the possibility of there being apostles of higher or lower rank, and God is not unjust that lie will forget tim work of him who is called the chosen vessel of election, and who laboured more abundantly than they all, or assign equal rewards to unequal deserts. Afterwards we read,[fn-68-P6829_2168400:212-nf] \"As in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be now alive.

There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differeth from another star in glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead.\" Like a learned commentator, you have explained this passage by saying that the spiritual differ from the carnal. It follows that in heaven there will be both spiritual and carnal persons, and not only will the sheep climb thither, but your goats also. \"One star,\" he says, \"differeth from another star in glory\": this is not the distinction of sheep and goat, but of sheep and sheep, star and star. Lastly, he says, \"there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon.\" But for this, you might maintain that the phrase one star from another star covers the whole human race; but he introduces the sun and moon, and you cannot possibly reckon them among the goats. \"So,\" says he, \"is also the resurrection of the dead\"-the just will shine with the brightness of the sun, and those of the next rank will glow with the splendour of the moon, so that one will be a Lucifer, another an Arcturus, a third an Orion, another Mazzaroth, or some other of the stars whose names are hollowed in the book of Job.[fn-68-P6831_2170121:214-nf] [fn-68-P6832_2170157:215-nf] \"For we all,\" he says, \"must be made manifest before the judgment-seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he hath done, whether it be good or bad.\" And you cannot say that the mode of our manifestation before the judgment-seat of Christ is such that the good receive good things, the bad evil things; for he[fn-68-P6833_2170535:216-nf] teaches us in the same epistle that he who soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly, and he that soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. Surely he who sows more and he who sows less are both on the right side. And although they belong to the same class, that of the sower, yet they differ in respect of measure and number. The same Paul, writing to the Ephesians, says:[fn-68-P6834_2170936:217-nf] \"to the intent that now unto the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places might be made known through the church the manifold wisdom of God.\" You observe that it is a varied and manifold wisdom of God which is spoken of as existing in the different ranks of the church. Arid in the same epistle we read,[fn-68-P6835_2171273:218-nf] \"Unto each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the grace of Christ\": not that Christ's measure varies, but only that so much of His grace is poured out as we can receive.","title":"Book II.","author":false},{"chapter":4,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_16_on_nature_and_grace_against_pelagius","source_chapter":81,"source_paragraph":"248","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But let us revert to the apostle's assertion: \"The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.\"[fn-23-P2338_960473:209-nf] By whom given if not by Him who \"ascended up on high, led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men?\"[fn-23-P2339_960594:210-nf] Forasmuch, however, as there is, owing to the defects that have entered our nature, not to the constitution of our nature, a certain necessary tendency to sin, a man should listen, and in order that the said necessity may cease to exit, learn to say to God, \"Bring Thou me out of my necessities;\"[fn-23-P2340_960910:211-nf] because in the very offering up of such a prayer there h a struggle against the tempter, who fights against us concerning this very necessity; and thus, by the assistance of grace through our Lord Jesus Christ, both the evil necessity will be removed and full liberty be bestowed.","title":"On Nature and Grace, Against Pelagius","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":30,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_20_commandment_tenth","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"ANF-02","text":"\"Hear, then,\" says he, \"foolish man, how grief crushes out the Holy Spirit, and on the other hand saves.

Truly the authors of these misfortunes, if such there be or ever have been, deserve the censures of these men, in that the renown of their former lives is thereby obscured, and they are deprived of the opportunity of mentioning and making much of their more impressive antecedents; the great distinctions with which each started in life; the professions they inherited from their fathers; the greater or the smaller marks of gentility of which each was conscious, even before they became so widely known and valued that even emperors numbered them amongst their acquaintance, as he now boasts in his book, and that all the higher governments were roused about them and the world was filled with their doings.","title":"Book I","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":4,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_18_book_xii_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"36","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"12. For, as not only most true reason but also the authority of the apostle himself declares, man was not made in the image of God according to the shape of his body, but according to his rational mind. For the thought is a debased and empty one, which holds God to be circumscribed and limited by the lineaments of bodily members. But further, does not the same blessed apostle say, \"Be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new man, which is created after God;\"[fn-15-P1541_757247:17-nf] and in another place more clearly, \"Putting off the old man,\" he says, \"with his deeds; put on the new man, which is renewed to the knowledge of God after the image of Him that created him?\"[fn-15-P1542_757460:18-nf] If, then, we are renewed in the spirit of our mind, and he is the new man who is renewed to the knowledge of God after the image of Him that created him; no one can doubt, that man was made after the image of Him that created him, not according to the body, nor indiscriminately according to any part of the mind, but according to the rational mind, wherein the knowledge of God can exist And it is according to this renewal, also, that we are made sons of God by the baptism of Christ; and putting on the new man, certainly put on Christ through faith. Who is there, then, who will hold women to be alien from this fellowship, whereas they are fellow-heirs of grace with us; and whereas in another place the same apostle says, \"For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus; for as many as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ: there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus?\"[fn-15-P1543_758474:19-nf] Pray, have faithful women then lost their bodily sex? But because they are there renewed after the image of God, where there is no sex; man is there made after the image of God, where there is no sex, that is, in the spirit of his mind. Why, then, is the man on that account not bound to cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God, while the woman is bound to do so, because she is the glory of the man; as though the woman were not renewed in the spirit of her mind, which spirit is renewed to the knowledge of God after the image of Him who created him? But because she differs from the man in bodily sex, it was possible rightly to represent under her bodily covering that part of the reason which is diverted to the government of temporal things; so that the image of God may remain on that side of the mind of man on which it cleaves to the beholding or the consulting of the eternal reasons of things; and this, it is clear, not men only, but also women have.","title":"Book XII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"55","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But of course they bring forward the passage in the book of Proverbs which says, \"The Lord created Me as the beginning of His ways, for His works[fn-11-P1118_605622:126-nf] .\" Now it would require a lengthy discussion to explain fully the real meaning of the passage: still it would be possible even in a few words to convey to well-disposed readers the thought intended.

But faith, of which we are compelled, by reason of the arrangement of our subject, to dispute somewhat more at length in this book: faith I say, which they who have are called the faithful, and they who have not, unbelievers, as were those who did not receive the Son of God coming to His own; although it is wrought in us by hearing, yet does not belong to that sense of the body which is called hearing, since it is not a sound; nor to the eyes of this our flesh, since it is neither color nor bodily form; nor to that which is called touch, since it has nothing of bulk; nor to any sense of the body at all, since it is a thing of the heart, not of the body; nor is it without apart from us, but deeply seated within us; nor does any man see it in another, but each one in himself. Lastly, it is a thing that can both be feigned by pretence, and be thought to be in him in whom it is not. Therefore every one sees his own faith in himself; but does not see, hut believes, that it is in another; and believes this the more firmly, the more he knows the fruits of it, which faith is wont to work by love.[fn-16-P1620_799427:4-nf] And therefore this faith is common to all of whom the evangelist subjoins, \"But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name: which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God;\" common I say, not as any form of a bodily object is common, as regards sight, to the eyes of all to whom it is present, for in some way the gaze of all that behold it is informed by the same one form; but as the human countenance can be said to be common to all men; for this is so said that yet each certainly has his own. We say certainly with perfect truth, that the faith of believers is impressed from one doctrine upon the heart of each several person who believes the same thing. But that which is believed is a different thing from the faith by which it is believed. For the former is in things which are said either to be, or to have been or to be about to be; but the latter is in the mind of the believer, and is visible to him only whose it is; although not indeed itself but a faith like it, is also in others. For it is not one in number, but in kind; yet on account of the likeness, and the absence of all difference, we rather call it one than many. For when, too, we see two men exceedingly alike, we wonder, and say that both have one countenance. It is therefore more easily said that the souls were many,-a several soul, of course, for each several person-of whom we read in the Acts of the Apostles, that they were of one soul,[fn-16-P1621_800982:5-nf] -than it is, where the apostle speaks of \"one faith,\"[fn-16-P1622_801053:6-nf] for any one to venture to say that there are as many faiths as there are faithful. And yet He who says, \"O woman, great is thy faith;\"[fn-16-P1623_801203:7-nf] and to another, \"O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?[fn-16-P1624_801289:8-nf] intimates that each has his own faith. But the like faith of believers is said to be one, in the same way as a like will of those who will is said to be one; since in the case also of those who have the same will, the will of each is visible to himself, but that of the other is not visible, although he wills the same thing; and if it intimate itself by any signs, it is believed rather! than seen. But each being conscious of his own mind certainly does not believe, but manifestly sees outright, that this is his own will.","title":"Book XIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_19_book_xiii_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"14.

For then He promised that He Himself would send Him, and He sent Him;[fn-16-P1660_828358:17-nf] because then, as it was written and foretold of Him, \"He ascended up on high, He led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.\"[fn-16-P1661_828527:18-nf] These gifts constitute our deserts, by which we arrive at the chief good of an immortal blessedness. \"But God,\" says the apostle, \"commendeth His love towards as, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more, then, being now justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.\" To this he goes on to add, \"For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son; much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.\" Those whom he first calls sinners he afterwards calls the enemies of God; and those whom he first speaks of as justified by His blood, he afterwards speaks of as reconciled by the death of the Son of God; and those whom he speaks of first as saved from wrath through Him, he afterwards speaks of as saved by His life. We were not, therefore, before that grace merely anyhow sinners, but in such sins that we were enemies of God.

And this word the Latin language had not previously, but could have seeing that it could have it when it wanted it. And this foregoing sentence of the apostle, where he says, \"For when we were yet weak, in due time He died for the ungodly,\" coheres with those two following sentences; in the one of which he spoke of sinners, in the other of enemies of God, as though he referred each severally to each, viz. sinners to the weak, the enemies of God to the ungodly.","title":"Book XIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_22_a_treatise_on_the_soul_","source_chapter":37,"source_paragraph":"137","folder":"ANF-03","text":"However, it is not for you alone, (Simon), that the transmigration philosophy has fabricated this story. Carpocrates also makes equally good use of it, who was a magician and a fornicator like yourself, only he had not a Helen.[fn-29-P2912_1021636:239-nf] And why should he not? since he asserted that souls are reinvested with bodies, in order to ensure the overthrow by all means of divine and human truth. For, (according to his miserable doctrine, ) this life became consummated to no man until all those blemishes which are held to disfigure it have been fully displayed in its conduct; because there is nothing which is accounted evil by nature, but simply as men think of it. The transmigration of human souls, therefore, into any kind of heterogeneous bodies, he thought by all means indispensable, whenever any depravity whatever had not been fully perpetrated in the early stage of life's passage. Evil deeds (one may be sure) appertain to life. Moreover, as often as the soul has fallen short as a defaulter in sin, it has to be recalled to existence, until it \"pays the utmost farthing,\"[fn-29-P2913_1022565:240-nf] thrust out from time to time into the prison of the body. To this effect does he tamper with the whole of that allegory of the Lord which is extremely clear and simple in its meaning, and ought to be from the first understood in its plain and natural sense. Thus our \"adversary\" (therein mentioned[fn-29-P2914_1022883:241-nf] ) is the heathen man, who is walking with us along the same road of life which is common to him and ourselves. Now \"we must needs go out of the world,\"[fn-29-P2915_1023051:242-nf] if it be not allowed us to have conversation with them. He bids us, therefore, show a kindly disposition to such a man. \"Love your enemies,\" says He, \"pray for them that curse you,\"[fn-29-P2916_1023254:243-nf] lest such a man in any transaction of business be irritated by any unjust conduct of yours, and \"deliver thee to the judge\" of his own (nation[fn-29-P2917_1023417:244-nf] ), and you be thrown into prison, and be detained in its close and narrow cell until you have liquidated all your debt against him.[fn-29-P2918_1023569:245-nf] Then, again, should you be disposed to apply the term \"adversary\" to the devil, you are advised by the (Lord's) injunction, while you are in the way with him,\" to make even with him such a compact as may be deemed compatible with the requirements of your true faith. Now the compact you have made respecting him is to renounce him, and his pomp, and his angels. Such is your agreement in this matter. Now the friendly understanding you will have to carry out must arise from your observance of the compact: you must never think of getting back any of the things which you have abjured, and have restored to him, lest he should summon you as a fraudulent man, and a transgressor of your agreement, before God the Judge (for in this light do we read of him, in another passage, as \"the accuser of the brethren,\"[fn-29-P2919_1024395:246-nf] or saints, where reference is made to the actual practice of legal prosecution); and lest this Judge deliver you over to the angel who is to execute the sentence, and he commit you to the prison of hell, out of which there will be no dismissal until the smallest even of your delinquencies be paid off in the period before the resurrection.[fn-29-P2920_1024757:247-nf] What can be a more fitting sense than this? What a truer interpretation? If, however, according to Carpocrates, the soul is bound to the commission of all sorts of crime and evil conduct, what must we from his system understand to be its \"adversary\" and foe? I suppose it must be that better mind which shall compel it by force to the performance of some act of virtue, that it may be driven from body to body, until it be found in none a debtor to the claims of a virtuous life. This means, that a good tree is known by its bad fruit-in other words, that the doctrine of truth is understood from the worst possible precepts. I apprehend[fn-29-P2921_1025621:248-nf] that heretics of this school seize with especial avidity the example of Elias, whom they assume to have been so reproduced in John (the Baptist) as to make our Lord's statement sponsor for their theory of transmigration, when He said, \"Elias is come already, and they knew him not; \"[fn-29-P2922_1025919:249-nf] and again, in another passage, \"And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.\"[fn-29-P2923_1026040:250-nf] Well, then, was it really in a Pythagorean sense that the Jews approached John with the inquiry, \"Art thou Elias? \"[fn-29-P2924_1026177:251-nf] and not rather in the sense of the divine prediction, \"Behold, I will send you Elijah\" the Tisbite?[fn-29-P2925_1026297:252-nf] The fact, however, is, that their metempsychosis, or transmigration theory, signifies the recall of the soul which had died long before, and its return to some other body. But Elias is to come again, not after quitting life (in the way of dying), but after his translation (or removal without dying); not for the purpose of being restored to the body, from which he had not departed, but for the purpose of revisiting the world from which he was translated; not by way of resuming a life which he had laid aside, but of fulfilling prophecy,-really and truly the same man, both in respect of his name and designation, as well as of his unchanged humanity.

For seeing that it is clear to all that God Who is over all has in Himself nothing as a thing created or imported, not power nor wisdom, nor light, nor word, nor life, nor truth, nor any at all of those things which are contemplated in the fulness of the Divine bosom (all which things the Only-begotten God is, Who is in the bosom of the Father[fn-13-P1357_732908:39-nf] , the name of \"creation\" could not properly be applied to any of those things which are contemplated in God, so that the Son Who is in the Father, or the Word Who is in the Beginning, or the Light Who is in the Light, or the Life Who is in the Life, or the Wisdom Who is in the Wisdom, should say, \"the Lord created me.\" For if the Wisdom of God is created (and Christ is the Power of God and the Wisdom of God[fn-13-P1358_733339:40-nf] ), God, it would follow, has His Wisdom as a thing imported, receiving afterwards, as the result of making, something which He had not at first. But surely He Who is in the bosom of the Father does not permit us to conceive the bosom of the Father as ever void of Himself. He Who is in the beginning is surely not of the things which come to be in that bosom from without, but being the fulness of all good, He is conceived as being always in the Father, not waiting to arise in Him as the result of creation, so that the Father should not be conceived as at any time void of good, but He Who is conceived as being in the eternity of the Father's Godhead is always in Him, being Power, and Life, and Truth, and Wisdom, and the like. Accordingly the words \"created me\" do not proceed from the Divine and immortal nature, but from that which was commingled with it in the Incarnation from our created nature. How comes it then that the same, called wisdom, and understanding, and intelligence, establishes the earth, and prepares the heavens, and breaks up the deeps, and yet is here \"created for the beginning of His works[fn-13-P1359_734481:41-nf] \"? Such a dispensation, he tells us, is not set forward without great cause. But since men, after receiving the commandment of the things we should observe, cast away by disobedience the grace of memory, and became forgetful, for this cause, \"that I may declare to you the things that happen day by day for your salvation, and may put you in mind by recounting the things from everlasting, which you have forgotten (for it is no new gospel that I now proclaim, but I labour at your restoration to your first estate),-for this cause I was created, Who ever am, and need no creation in order to be; so that I am the beginning of ways for the works of God, that is for men. For the first way being destroyed, there must needs again be consecrated for the wanderers a new and living way[fn-13-P1360_735336:42-nf] , even I myself, Who am the way.\" And this view, that the sense of \"created me\" has reference to the Humanity, the divine apostle more clearly sets before us by his own words when he charges us, \"Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ[fn-13-P1361_735585:43-nf] ,\" and also where (using the same word) he says, \"Put on the new man which after God is created[fn-13-P1362_735701:44-nf] \" For if the garment of salvation is one, and that is Christ, one cannot say that \"the new man, which after God is created,\" is any other than Christ, but it is clear that he who has \"put on Christ\" has \"put on the new man which after God is created.\" For actually He alone is properly named \"the new man,\" Who did not appear in the life of man by the known and ordinary ways of nature, but in His case alone creation, in a strange and special form, was instituted anew. For this reason he haines the same Person, when regarding the wonderful manner of His birth[fn-13-P1363_736282:45-nf] , \"the new man, which after God is created,\" and, when looking to the Divine nature, which was blended[fn-13-P1364_736401:46-nf] in the creation of this \"new man,\" he calls Him \"Christ\": so that the two names (I mean the name of \"Christ\" and the name of \"the new man which after God is created\") are applied to one and the same Person,","title":"Book III","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":4,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_20_book_xiv_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"63","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"22. But those who, by being reminded, are turned to the Lord from that deformity whereby they were through worldly lusts conformed to this world, are formed anew from the world, when they hearken to the apostle, saying,\" Be not conformed to this world, but be ye formed again in the renewing of your mind;\"[fn-18-P1853_931055:52-nf] that that image may begin to be formed again by Him by whom it had been formed at first. For that image cannot form itself again, as it could deform itself. He says again elsewhere: \"Be ye renewed in the spirit of your mind; and put ye on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.\"[fn-18-P1854_931389:53-nf] That which is meant by \"created after God,\" is expressed in another place by \"after the image of God.\"[fn-18-P1855_931514:54-nf] But it lost righteousness and true holiness by sinning, through which that image became defaced and, tarnished; and this it recovers when it is formed again and renewed. But when he says, \"In the spirit of your mind,\" he does not in: tend to be understood of two things, as though mind were one, and the spirit of the mind another; but he speaks thus, because all mind is spirit, but all spirit is not mind. For there is a Spirit also that is God,[fn-18-P1856_931979:55-nf] which cannot be renewed, because it cannot grow old. And we speak also of a spirit in man distinct from the mind, to which spirit belong the images that are formed after the likeness of bodies; and of this the apostle speaks to the Corinthians, where he says, \"But if I shall have prayed with a tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.\"[fn-18-P1857_932356:56-nf] For he speaks thus, when that which is said is not understood; since it cannot even be said, unless the images of the corporeal articulate sounds anticipate the oral sound by the thought of the spirit. The soul of man is also called spirit, whence are the words in the Gospel, \"And He bowed His head, and gave up His spirit;\"[fn-18-P1858_932703:57-nf] by which the death of the body, through the spirit's leaving it, is signified. We speak also of the spirit of a beast, as it is expressly written in the book of Solomon called Ecclesiastes; \"Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?\"[fn-18-P1859_933025:58-nf] It is written too in Genesis, where it is said that by the deluge all flesh died which \"had in it the spirit of life.\"[fn-18-P1860_933166:59-nf] We speak also of the spirit, meaning the wind, a thing most manifestly corporeal; whence is that in the Psalms,\" Fire and hail, snow and ice, the spirit of the I storm.\"[fn-18-P1861_933355:60-nf] Since spirit, then, is a word of so many meanings, the apostle intended to express by \"the spirit of the mind\" that spirit which is called the mind. As the same apostle also, when he says, \"In putting off the body of the flesh,\"[fn-18-P1862_933605:61-nf] certainly did not intend two things, as though flesh were one, and the body of the flesh another; but because body is the name of many things that have no flesh (for besides the flesh, there are many bodies celestial and bodies terrestrial), he expressed by the body of the flesh that body which is flesh. In like manner, therefore, by the spirit of the mind, that spirit which is mind. Elsewhere,too,he has even more plainly called it an image, while enforcing the same thing in other words. \"Do you,\" he says, \"putting off the old man with his deeds, put on the new man, which is renewed in the knowledge of God after the image of Him that created him.\"[fn-18-P1863_934279:62-nf] Where the one passage reads, \"Put ye on the new man, which is created after God,\" the other has, \"Put ye on the new man, which is renewed after the image of Him that created him.\"","title":"Book XIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_15_book_iv","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"26","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Now that we have arrived at the understanding of these words, no one could any longer hesitate as to the other passages, for what reason He is the first-born, either \"of the dead,\" or \"of the creation,\" or \"among many brethren.\" For all these passages refer to the same point, although each of them sets forth some special conception. He is the first-born from the dead, Who first by Himself loosed the pains of death[fn-14-P1478_825316:28-nf] , that He might also make that birth of the resurrection a way for all men[fn-14-P1479_825409:29-nf] . Again, He becomes \"the first-born among many brethren,\" Who is born before us by the new birth of regeneration in water, for the travail whereof the hovering of the Dove was the midwife, whereby He makes those who share with Him in the like birth to be His own brethren, and becomes the first-born of those who after Him are born of water and of the Spirit[fn-14-P1480_825829:30-nf] : and to speak briefly, as there are in us three births, whereby human nature is quickened, one of the body, another in the sacrament of regeneration, another by that resurrection of the dead for which we look, He is first-born in all three:-of the twofold regeneration which is wrought by two (by baptism and by the resurrection), by being Himself the leader in each of them; while it, the flesh He is first-born, as having first and alone devised in His own case that birth unknown to nature, which no one in the many generations of men had originated. If these passages, then, have been rightly understood, neither will the signification of the \"creation,\" of which He is first-born, be unknown to as. For we recognize a twofold creation of our nature, the first that whereby we were made, the second that whereby we were made anew. But there would have been no need of the second creation had we not made the first unavailing by our disobedience. Accordingly, when the first creation had waxed old and vanished away, it was needful that there should be a new creation in Christ, (as the Apostle says, who asserts that we should no longer see in the second creation any trace of that which has waxed old, saying, \"Having put off the old man with his deeds and his lusts, put on the new man which is created according to God[fn-14-P1481_827405:31-nf] ,\" and \"If any man be in Christ,\" he says, \"he is a new creature: the old things are passed away, behold all things are become new[fn-14-P1482_827575:32-nf] :\") -for the maker of human nature at the first and afterwards is one and the same. Then He took dust from the earth and formed man: again, He took dust from the Virgin, and did not merely form man, but formed man about Himself: then, He created; afterwards, He was created: then, the Word made flesh; afterwards, the Word became flesh, that He might change our flesh to spirit, by being made partaker with us in flesh and blood. Of this new creation therefore in Christ, which He Himself began, He was called the first-born, being the first-fruits of all, both of those begotten into life, and of those quickened by resurrection of the dead, \"that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living[fn-14-P1483_828299:33-nf] ,\" and might sanctify the whole lump[fn-14-P1484_828354:34-nf] by means of its first-fruits in Himself. Now that the character of \"first-born\" does not apply to the Son in respect of His pre-temporal existence the appellation of \"Only-begotten\" testifies. For he who is truly only-begotten has no brethren, for bow could any one be only-begotten if numbered among brethren? but as He is called God and man, Son of God and Son of man,-for He has the form of God and the form of a servant[fn-14-P1485_828800:35-nf] , being some things according to His supreme nature, becoming other things in His dispensation of love to man,-so too, being the Only-begotten God, He becomes the first-born of all creation,-the Only-begotten, He that is in the bosom of the Father, yet, among the e who are saved by the new creation, both becoming and being called the first born of the creation. But if, as heresy will have it, He is called first-born because He was made before the rest of the creation, the name does not agree with what they maintain concerning the Only-begotten God. For they do not say this,-that the Son and the universe were from the Father in like manner,-but they say, that the Only-begotten God was made by the Father, and that all else was made by the Only-begotten. Therefore on the same ground on which, while they hold that the Son was created, they call God the Father of the created Being, on the same ground, while they say that all things were made by the Only-begotten God, they give Him the name not of the \"first-born\" of the things that were made by Him, but more properly of their \"Father,\" as the same relation existing in both cases towards the things created, logically gives rise to the same appellation. For if God, Who is over all, is not properly called the \"First-born,\" but the Father of the Being He Himself created, the Only-begotten God will surely also be called, by the same reasoning, the \"father,\" and not properly the \"first-born\" of His own creatures, so that the appellation of \"first-born\" will be altogether improper and superfluous, having no place in the heretical conception,","title":"Book IV","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":4,"verse":27,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_23_ix_de_fuga_in_persecutione_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"ANF-04","text":"9. The teaching of the apostles was surely in everything according to the mind of God: they forgot and omitted nothing of the Gospel. Where, then, do you show that they renewed the command to flee from city to city? In fact, it was utterly impossible that they should have laid down anything so utterly opposed to their own examples as a command to flee, while it was just from bonds, or the islands in which, for confessing, not fleeing from the Christian name, they were confined, they wrote their letters to the Churches. Paul[fn-19-P1974_594332:34-nf] bids us support the weak, but most certainly it is not when they flee. For how can the absent be supported by you? By bearing with them? Well, he says that people must be supported, if anywhere they have committed a fault through the weakness of their faith, just as (he enjoins) that we should comfort the faint-hearted; he does not say, however, that they should be sent into exile. But when he urges us not to give place to evil,[fn-19-P1975_594786:35-nf] he does not offer the suggestion that we should take to our heels, he only teaches that passion should be kept under restraint; and if he says that the time must be redeemed, because the days are evil,[fn-19-P1976_595006:36-nf] he wishes us to gain a lengthening of life, not by flight, but by wisdom. Besides, he who bids us shine as sons of light,[fn-19-P1977_595145:37-nf] does not bid us hide away out of sight as sons of darkness. He commands us to stand stedfast,[fn-19-P1978_595259:38-nf] certainly not to act an opposite. part by fleeing; and to be girt, not to play the fugitive or oppose the Gospel. He points out weapons, too, which persons who intend to run away would not require. And among these he notes the shield[fn-19-P1979_595513:39-nf] too, that ye may be able to quench the darts of the devil, when doubtless ye resist him, and sustain his assaults in their utmost force. Accordingly John also teaches that we must lay down our lives for the brethren;[fn-19-P1980_595748:40-nf] much more, then, we must do it for the Lord. This cannot be fulfilled by those who flee. Finally, mindful of his own Revelation, in which he had heard the doom of the fearful, (and so) speaking from personal knowledge, he warns us that fear must be put away. \"There is no fear,\" says he, \"in love; but perfect love casteth out fear; because fear has torment\"-the fire of the lake, no doubt. \"He that feareth is not perfect in love\"[fn-19-P1981_596201:41-nf] -to wit, the love of God. And yet who will flee from persecution, but he who fears? Who will fear, but he who has not loved? Yes; and if you ask counsel of the Spirit, what does He approve more than that utterance of the Spirit? For, indeed, it incites all almost to go and offer themselves in martyrdom, not to flee from it; so that we also make mention of it. If you are exposed to public infamy, says he, it is for your good; for he who is not exposed to dishonour among men is sure to be so before the Lord. Do not be ashamed; righteousness brings you forth into the public gaze. Why should you be ashamed of gaining glory? The opportunity is given you when you are before the eyes of men. So also elsewhere: seek not to die on bridal beds, nor in miscarriages, nor in soft fevers, but to die the martyr's death, that He may be glorified who has suffered for you.","title":"IX.

But this God does, distinguishing between the vessels of wrath and the vessels of mercy, by His own very secret but very just providence. When He Himself aids the soul in His own hidden and wonderful ways, and the sin which dwells in our members, and is, as the apostle teaches, rather the punishment of sin, does not reignin our mortal body to obey the lusts of it, and when we no longer yield our members as instruments of unrighteousness,[fn-25-P2566_1425589:18-nf] then the soul is converted from its own evil and selfish desires, and, God possessing it, it possesses itself in peace even in this life, and afterwards, with perfected health and endowed with immortality, will reign without sin in peace everlasting.","title":"Book XV","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_111_treatise_i_on_the_unity_of_the_church_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"ANF-05","text":"4.

So that because he referred ministrations to the Lord and workings to God, be does not appear to have understood one and the same Being in ministrations and operations. Learn how these members which minister are also members which work, when he says, Ye are the body of Christ, and of Him members indeed.

But perhaps thou maintainest that they have not been ordained by Christ, because it was God Who ordained them.

But if impiety has assumed to itself that because he says, The same Lord and the same God[fn-16-P1683_1103913:50-nf] , they are not in unity of nature, I will support this interpretation with what you deem still stronger arguments. For the same Apostle says, But for us there is one God, the Father, of Whom are all things, and we in Him, and one Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom are all things, and we through Him[fn-16-P1684_1104233:51-nf] . And again, One Lord, one .faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, Who is both through all, and in us all[fn-16-P1685_1104365:52-nf] . By these words one God and one Lord it would seem that to God only is attributed, as to one God, the property of being God; since the property of oneness does not admit of partnership with another. Verily how rare and hard to attain are such spiritual gifts! How truly is the manifestation of the Spirit seen in the bestowal of such useful gifts! And with reason has this order in the distribution of graces been appointed, that the foremost should be the word of wisdom; for true it is, And no one can call Jesus Lord but in the Holy Spirit[fn-16-P1686_1104929:53-nf] , because but through this word of wisdom Christ could not be understood to be Lord; that then there should follow next the word of understanding, that we might speak with understanding what we know, and might know the word of wisdom; and that the third gift should consist of faith, seeing that those leading and higher graces would be unprofitable gifts did we not believe that He is God. So that in the true sense of this greatest and most noble utterance of the Apostle no heretics possess either the word of wisdom or the word of knowledge or the faith of religion, inasmuch as wilful wickedness, being incapable of understanding, is void of knowledge of the word and of genuineness of faith. For no one utters what he does not know; nor can he believe that which he cannot utter; and thus when the Apostle preached one God, a proselyte as He was from the Law, and called to the gospel of Christ, he has attained to the confession of a perfect faith. And lest the simplicity of a seemingly unguarded statement might afford heretics any opportunity for denying through the preaching of one God the birth of the Son, the Apostle has set forth one God while indicating His peculiar attribute in these words, One God the Father, of Whom are all thing, and we in Him[fn-16-P1687_1106216:54-nf] , in order that He Who is God might also be acknowledged as Father. Afterwards, inasmuch as this bare belief in one God the Father would not suffice for salvation, he added, And one, our Lord Jesus Christ, throughh Whom are all things, and we through Him, shewing that the purity of saving faith consists in the preaching of one God and one Lord, so that we might believe in one God the Father and one Lord Jesus Christ. For he knew full well how our Lord had said, For this is the will of My Father, that every one that seeth the Son and believeth on Him should have eternal life[fn-16-P1688_1106815:55-nf] . But in fixing the order of the Church's faith, and basing our faith upon the Father and the Son, he has uttered the mystery of that indivisible and indissoluble unity and faith in the words one God and one Lord.","title":"Book VIII.","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":4,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_15_book_iii_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"87","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"48.

The martyr then was moved, but the demon not even then enjoyed freedom from fear, but straightway learned that it is possible to move the bones of a martyr, but not to escape his hands. For as soon as the coffin was drawn into the city, a thunderbolt came from above upon the head of his image, and burnt it all up. And yet, if not before, then at least there was likelihood that the impious emperor would be angry, and that he would send forth his anger against the testimony of the martyr. But not even then did he dare, so great fear possessed him. But although he saw that the burning was intolerable, and knew the cause accurately; he kept quiet. And this is not only wonderful that he did not destroy the testimony, but that he not even dared to put the roof on to the temple again. For he knew, he knew, that the stroke was divinely sent, and he feared lest by forming any further plan, he should call down that fire upon his own head. On this account he endured to see the shrine of Apollo brought to so great desolation; For there was no other cause, on account of which he did not rectify that which had happened, but fear alone. For which reason he unwillingly kept quiet, and knowing this left as much reproach to the demon, as distinction to the martyr. For the walls are now standing, instead of trophies, uttering a voice clearer than a trumpet. To those in Daphne, to those in the city, to those who arrive from far off, to those who are with us, to those men which shall be hereafter, they declare everything by their appearance, the wrestling, the struggle, the victory of the martyr. For it is likely that he who dwells far off from the suburb, when he sees the chapel of the saint deprived of a shrine, and the temple of Apollo deprived of its roof would ask the reason of each of these things; and then after learning the whole history would depart hence. Such are the noble deeds of the martyr after death, wherefore I count your city blessed, that ye have shown much zeal about this holy man. For then, when he returned from Daphne, all our city poured forth into the road, and the market places were empty of men, and the houses were empty of women, and the bedchambers were destitute of maidens. Thus also every age and each sex passed forth from the city, as if to receive a father long absent who was returning from sojourn far away. And you indeed gave him back to the band of fellow enthusiasts. But the grace of God did not suffer him to remain there for good, but again removed him beyond the river,[fn-8-P814_545819:6-nf] so that many parts of the country were filled with the sweet savor of the martyr. Neither even when he came hither was he destined to be alone, but he quickly received, a neighbor, and a fellow-lodger, and one of similar life.[fn-8-P815_546158:7-nf] For he shared with him the same dignity, and for the sake of religion shewed forth equal boldness. Wherefore he obtained the same abode as he, this wonderful man being no vain imitator, as it seems, of the martyr. For for so long a time he laboured there, sending letters continually to the emperor, wearying the authorities, and bringing he ministry of the body to bear upon the martyr. For ye know, doubtless, and remember that when the midday summer sun possessed the heaven, he together with his acquaintances, used to walk thither everyday, not as spectator only, but also, as intending to be a sharer in what was going on. For he often handled stone, and dragged a rope, and listened, in advance of the workmen themselves, to one who wanted to erect any building, For he knew, he knew what rewards lie in store for him for these things. And on this account he continued doing service to the martyrs, not only by splendid buildings nor even by continual feasts, but by a better method than these. And what is this? He imitates their life, emulates their courage, throughout according to his ability he keeps the image of the martyrs alive, in himself. For see, they gave their bodies to the slaughter, he has mortified the members of his flesh which are upon the earth. They stopped the flame of fire, he quenched the flame of lust. They fought against the teeth of beasts, but this man bore off the most dangerous of our passions, anger. For all these things let us give thanks to God, because he hath thus granted us noble martyrs, and pastors worthy of martyrs, for the perfecting of the saints, for the edifying of the body of Christ[fn-8-P816_548004:8-nf] with whom be glory, honor, and might to the Father, with the Holy and lifegiving Spirit, now and always, for ever and ever.

Restrain thy tongue from evil speaking, and put the bridle of the law upon thy mouth; so that you shall speak, if you speak at all, only when it would be a sin to be silent. Beware lest you utter anything which might be justly found fault with. A word once spoken is like a stone which has been thrown: wherefore it should be long thought over before it is uttered. Blessed, assuredly, are the lips, which never utter what they would wish to recall. The talk of a chaste mind ought itself also to be chaste, such as may always rather edify than injure the hearers, according to that commandment of the Apostle when he says, \"Let no[fn-8-P844_337372:62-nf] corrupt communications proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good for the edification of faith, that it may convey grace to them that hear.\" Precious to God is that tongue which knows not to form words except about divine things, and holy is that mouth from which heavenly utterances continually flow forth. Put down by the authority of Scripture calumniators of those who are absent, as being evil-minded persons, because the prophet mentions this also as among the virtues of a perfect man, if, in the presence of the righteous an evil-minded man, who brings forward things against his neighbor which cannot be proved, is brought down to nothing. For it is not lawful for you patiently to listen to evil-speaking against another, inasmuch as you would not wish that to be done by others when directed against yourself. Certainly, everything is unrighteous which goes against the Gospel of Christ, and that is the case, if you quietly permit anything to be done to another, which you would feel painful, if done by any one to yourself. Accustom your tongue always to speak about those who are good, and lend your ears rather to listen to the praises of good men than to the condemnation of such as are wicked. Take heed that all the good actions you perform are done for the sake of God, knowing that for every such deed you will only receive a reward, so far as you have done it out of regard to his fear and love.

For us Christ crucified is one, Christ the wisdom of God another: Christ Who was buried different from Christ Who descended from Heaven: the Son of Man not at the same time also Son of God. We teach that which we do not understand: we seek to refute that which we cannot grasp. We men improve upon the revelation of God: we are not content to say with the Apostle, Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth, who is he that condemneth? It is Christ Jesus, that died, yea, rather, that was raised front the dead, Who is at the right hand of God, Who also maketh intercession far us[fn-21-P2137_1373188:117-nf] . Is He Who intercedes for us other than He Who is at the right hand of God? Is not He Who is at the right hand of God the very same Who rose again? Is He Who rose again other than He Who died? He Who died than He Who condemns us? Lastly, is not He Who condemns us also God Who justifies us? Distinguish, if you can, Christ our accuser from God our defender, Christ Who died from Christ Who condemns, Christ sitting at the right hand of God and praying for us from Christ Who died. Whether, therefore, dead or buried, descended into Hades or ascended into Heaven, all is one and the same Christ: as the Apostle says, Now this `He ascended' what is it, but that He also descended to the lower parts of the earth? He that descended is the same also that ascended far above all heavens, that He may fill all things[fn-21-P2138_1374026:118-nf] . How far then shall we push our babbling ignorance and blasphemy, professing to explain what is hidden in the mystery of God? He that descended is the same also that ascended. Can we longer doubt that the Man Christ Jesus rose from the dead, ascended above the heavens and is at the right hand of God? We cannot say His body descended into Hades, which lay in the grave. If then He Who descended is one with Him, Who ascended; if His body did not go down into Hades, yet really arose from the dead, and ascended into heaven, what remains, except to believe in the secret mystery, which is hidden from the world and the rulers of this age, and to confess that, ascending or descending, He is but One, one Jesus Christ for us, Son of God and Son of Man, God the Word and Man in the flesh, Who suffered, died, was buried, rose again, was received into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God: Who possesses in His one single self, according to the Divine Plan and nature, in the form of God and in the form of a servant, the Human and Divine without separation or division.","title":"Book X","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":4,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_18_lecture_xiii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"30","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"29.

For whereas in the day there are many to distract, and draw him off; in the night, when he is alone, and is thinking it over by himself, the waves swell, and the storm becomes greater. Therefore Paul, you see, to prevent this, would fain commit him to the night already reconciled, that the devil may after that have no opportunity, from his solitude, to rekindle the furnace of his wrath, and make it fiercer. Thus also Christ permits not, though it be ever so little delay, lest, the sacrifice being accomplished, such an one become more remiss, procrastinating from day to day: for He knows that the case requires very speedy treatment.

The Apostle in his letter to the Ephesians, reviewing in its manifold aspects the full and perfect mystery of the Gospel, mingles with other instructions in the knowledge of God the following: As ye also were called in one hope of your calling; One Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, and through all, and in us all[fn-21-P2162_1386534:1-nf] . He does not leave us in the vague and misleading paths of an indefinite teaching, or abandon us to the shifting fancies of imagination, but limits the unimpeded license of intellect and desire by the appointment of restraining barriers. He gives us no opportunity to be wise beyond what he preached, but defines in exact and precise language the faith fixed for all time, that there may be no excuse for instability of belief. He declares one faith, as he preaches one Lord, and pronounces one baptism, as he declares one faith of one Lord, that as there is one faith of one Lord, so there may be one baptism of one faith in one Lord. And since the whole mystery of the baptism and the faith is not only in one Lord, but also in one God, he completes the consummation of our hope by the confession of one God. The one baptism and the one faith are of one God, as they are of one Lord. Lord and God are each one, not by union of person but by distinction of properties: for, on the one hand, it is the property of Each to be one, whether of the Father in His Fatherhood, or of the Son in His Sonship, and on the other hand, that property of individuality, which Each possesses, constitutes for Each the mystery of His union with the Other. Thus the one Lord Christ cannot take away from God the Father His Lordship, or the one God the Father deny to the one Lord Christ His Godhead. If, because God is one, Christ is not also by nature divine, then we cannot allow that the one God is Lord, because there is one Lord Christ: that is, on the supposition that by their `oneness' is signified not the mystery, but an exclusive unity. So there is one baptism and one faith of one Lord, as of one God.","title":"Book XI.","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":4,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_19_lecture_xiv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"35","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"24.

It is related that this latter was deeply versed in Grecian erudition, and was the first to subdue his native tongue to meters and musical laws; these verses he delivered to the choirs, and even now the Syrians frequently sing, not the precise copies by Harmonius, but the same melodies. For as Harmonius was not altogether free from the errors of his father, and entertained various opinions concerning the soul, the generation and destruction of the body, and the regeneration which are taught by the Greek philosophers, he introduced some of these sentiments into the lyrical songs which he composed. When Ephraim perceived that the Syrians were charmed with the elegance of the diction and the rhythm of the melody, he became apprehensive, lest they should imbibe the same opinions; and therefore, although he was ignorant of Grecian learning, he applied himself to the understanding of the metres of Harmonius, and composed similar poems in accordance with the doctrines of the Church, and wrought also in sacred hymns and in the praises of passionless men. From that period the Syrians sang the odes of Ephraim according to the law of the ode established by Harmonius. The execution of this work is alone sufficient to attest the natural endowments of Ephraim. He was as celebrated for the good actions he performed as for the rigid course of discipline he pursued. He was particularly fond of tranquillity. He was so serious and so careful to avoid giving occasion to calumny, that he refrained from the very sight of women. It is related that a female of careless life, who was either desirous of tempting him, or who had been bribed for the purpose, contrived on one occasion to meet him face to face, and fixed her eyes intently upon him; he rebuked her, and commanded her to look down upon the ground, \"Wherefore should I obey your injunction,\" replied the woman; \"for I was born not of the earth, but of you? It would be more just if you were to look down upon the earth whence you sprang, while I look upon you, as I was born of you.\" Ephraim, astonished at the little woman, recorded the whole transaction in a book, which most Syrians regard as one of the best of his productions. It is also said of him, that, although he was naturally prone to passion, he never exhibited angry feeling toward any one from the period of his embracing a monastic life. It once happened that after he had, according to custom, been fasting several days, his attendant, in presenting some food to him, let fall the dish on which it was placed. Ephraim, perceiving that he was overwhelmed with shame and terror, said to him, \"Take courage; we will go to the food as the food does not come to us\"; and he immediately seated himself beside the fragments of the dish, and ate his supper. What I am about to relate will suffice to show that he was totally exempt from the love of vainglory. He was appointed bishop of some town, and attempts were made to convey him away for the purpose of ordaining him. As soon as he became aware of what was intended, he ran to the market-place, and showed himself as a madman by stepping in a disorderly way, dragging his clothes along, and eating in public. Those who had come to carry him away to be their bishop, on seeing him in this state, believed that he was out of his mind, and departed; and he, meeting with an opportunity for effecting his escape, remained in concealment until another had been ordained in his place. What I have now said concerning Ephraim must suffice, although his own countrymen relate many other anecdotes of him. Yet his conduct on one occasion, shortly before his death, appears to me so worthy of remembrance that I shall record it here. The city of Edessa being severely visited by famine, he quitted the solitary ceil in which he pursued philosophy, and rebuked the rich for permitting the poor to die around them, instead of imparting to them of their superfluities; and he represented to them by his philosophy, that the wealth which they were treasuring up so carefully would turn to their own condemnation, and to the ruin of the soul, which is of more value than all riches, and the body itself and all other values, and he proved that they were putting no estimate upon their souls, because of their actions. The rich men, revering the man and his words, replied, \"We are not intent upon hoarding our wealth, but we know of no one to whom we can confide the distribution of our goods, for all are prone to seek after lucre, and to betray the trust placed in them.\" \"What think you of me?\" asked Ephraim. On their admitting that they considered him an efficient, excellent, and good man, and worthy, and that he was exactly what his reputation confirmed, he offered to undertake the distribution of their alms. As soon as he received their money, he had about three hundred beds fitted up in the public porches; and here he tended those who were ill and suffering from the effects of the famine, whether they were foreigners or natives of the surrounding country. On the cessation of the famine he returned to the cell in which he had previously dwelt; and, after the lapse of a few days, he expired. He attained no higher clerical degree than that of deacon, although he became no less famous for his virtue than those who are ordained to the priesthood and are admired for the conversation of a good life and for learning. I have now given some account of the virtue of Ephraim. It would require a more experienced hand than mine, to furnish a full description of his character and that of the other illustrious men who, about the same period, had devoted themselves to a life and career of philosophy; and for some things, it would require such a writer as he himself was. The attempt is beyond my powers by reason of weakness of language, and ignorance of the men themselves and their exploits. Some of them concealed themselves in the deserts. Others, who lived in the intercourse of cities, strove to preserve a mean appearance, and to seem as if they differed in no respect from the multitude, working out their virtue, concealing a true estimate of themselves, that they might avoid the praises of others. For as they were intent upon the exchange of future benefits, they made God alone the witness of their thoughts, and had no concern for outward glory.","title":"Book III.","author":"Hermias Sozomen"},{"chapter":4,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_25_book_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"17","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"15.

However, be ye renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put ye on that new man, which is created according to God[fn-23-P2390_1529715:47-nf] . So the new man is to be put on Who has been created according to God. For He Who was Son of God was born also Son Man. This was not the birth of the divinity, but the creating of the flesh; the new Man taking the title of the race, and being created according to God Who was born before the ages. And how the new man was created according to God, he explains in what follows, adding, in righteousness, and in holiness, and in truth[fn-23-P2391_1530170:48-nf] .

Nevertheless I fear and tremble, not indeed distressed for the sake of you who are noble champions of the truth, but because I know that it comes to pass that some men are of feebler heart. If among twelve apostles one was found a traitor, there is no doubt that among a number many times as great any one might easily discover many falling short of perfection.

For it would be preposterous that he should enjoy the dignity of his command, and, in the hour of need, run out of danger's way. Thus the thrice blessed prophets ever acted, making light of the safety of their bodies, and, for the sake of the Jews who hated and rejected them, underwent all kinds of peril and toil. Of them the divine apostle says \"they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain by the sword; they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world was not worthy; they wandered in deserts and mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.\"[fn-57-P5715_1396536:123-nf] Thus the divine apostles travelled preaching over all the world, without home, bed, bedding, board, or any of the necessaries of life, but scourged, racked, imprisoned, and undergoing countless kinds of death. And all this they underwent, not for the sake of their friends, but voluntarily facing these perils for the sake of the men who were persecuting them. A far stronger claim is made on you now to accept the peril at present assailing you, for the sake of fellow-believers and brothers and children. This affection is shown even by unreasoning animals, for sparrows may be seen fighting with all their force in behalf of their brood, and putting out in their defence all the strength they have; other kinds of birds moreover undergo danger for their young. But why do I speak of birds? Bears too, and leopards, wolves, and lions, voluntarily suffer any pain for the safety of their offspring, for instead of fleeing from the hunter they will await his attack and do battle for their young.","title":"Letters of the Blessed Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":4,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_23_letters_of_the_blessed_theodoret_bishop_of_cyrus","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"213","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"In the same manner we call those men corrupt and exclude them from the assembly of the Christians, who divide our one Lord Jesus Christ into two persons or two sons or two Lords, for we have heard the very divine Paul saying \"One Lord, one faith, one baptism\"[fn-57-P5790_1431657:164-nf] and again \"One Lord Jesus Christ by Whom are all things\"[fn-57-P5791_1431733:165-nf] and again \"Jesus Christ the same yesterday and to-day and for ever\"[fn-57-P5792_1431825:166-nf] and in another place-\"He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens.\"[fn-57-P5793_1431944:167-nf] And countless other passages of this kind may be found in the Apostle's writings, proclaiming the one Lord.","title":"Letters of the Blessed Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":4,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_23_letters_of_the_blessed_theodoret_bishop_of_cyrus","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"370","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"You have shewn alike your zeal for the true religion, and your love for your neighbour,both of which are at the present time clearly connected, for it is for the sake of the apostolic decrees that I am being attacked, because I refuse to give up the heritage of my fathers, and prefer to undergo any suffering to looking lightly on the robbery of one tittle from the faith of the Gospel.

For my part, they seem to be wiser who make no doubt that both sexes shall rise, For there shall be no lust, which is now the cause of confusion. For before they sinned, the man and the woman were naked, and were not ashamed. From those bodies, then, vice shall be withdrawn, while nature shall be preserved. And the sex of woman is not a vice, but nature. It shall then indeed be superior to carnal intercourse and child-bearing; nevertheless the female members shall remain adapted not to the old uses, but to a new beauty, which, so far from provoking lust, now extinct, shall excite praise to the wisdom and clemency of God, who both made what was not and delivered from corruption what He made.

For that sleep of the man was the death of Christ, whose side, as He hung lifeless upon the cross, was pierced with a spear, and there flowed from it blood and water, and these we know to be the sacraments by which the Church is \"built up.\" For Scripture used this very word, not saying \"He formed\" or \"framed,\" but \"built her up into a woman;\"[fn-44-P4447_2451199:34-nf] whence also the apostle speaks of the edification of the body of Christ,[fn-44-P4448_2451290:35-nf] which is the Church. The woman, therefore, is a creature of God even as the man; but by her creation from man unity is commended; and the manner of her creation prefigured, as has been said, Christ and the Church. He, then, who created both sexes will restore both. Jesus Himself also, when asked by the Sadducees, who denied the resurrection, which of the seven brothers should have to wife the woman whom all in succession had taken to raise up seed to their brother, as the law enjoined, says, \"Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.\"[fn-44-P4449_2451867:36-nf] And though it was a fit opportunity for His saying, She about whom you make inquiries shall herself be a man, and not a woman, He said nothing of the kind; but \"In the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.\"[fn-44-P4450_2452156:37-nf] They shall be equal to the angels in immortality and happiness, not in flesh, nor in resurrection, which the angels did not need, because they could not die. The Lord then denied that there would be in the resurrection, not women, but marriages; and He uttered this denial in circumstances in which the question mooted would have been more easily and speedily solved by denying that the female sex would exist, if this had in truth been foreknown by Him.

And He gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come to the unity of the faith and knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the age of the fullness of Christ: that we henceforth be no more children, tossed and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in Him in all things, which is the Head, even Christ: from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body, unto the edifying of itself in love.\"[fn-44-P4454_2454207:38-nf] Behold what the perfect man is-the head and the body, which is made up of all the members, which in their own time shall be perfected. But new additions are daily being made to this body while, the Church is being built up, to which it is said, \"Ye are the body of Christ and His members;\"[fn-44-P4455_2454518:39-nf] and again, \"For His body's sake,\" he says, \"which is the Church;\"[fn-44-P4456_2454605:40-nf] and again, \"We being many are one head, one body.\"[fn-44-P4457_2454672:41-nf] It is of the edification of this body that it is here, too, said, \"For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edification of the body of Christ;\" and then that passage of which we are now speaking is added, \"Till we all come to the unity of the faith and knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the age of the fullness of Christ,\" and so on. And he shows of what body we are to understand this to be the measure, when he says, \"That we may grow up into Him in all things, which is the Head, even Christ: from whom the whole body filly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part.\" As, therefore, there is a measure of every part, so there is a measure of the fullness of the whole body which is made up of all its parts, and it is of this measure it is said, \"To the measure of the age of the fullness of Christ.\" This fullness he spoke of also in the place where he says of Christ, \"And gave Him to be the Head over all things to the Church,[fn-44-P4458_2455776:42-nf] which is His body, the fullness of Him that filleth all in all.'[fn-44-P4459_2455895:43-nf] But even if this should be referred to the form in which each one shall rise, what should hinder us from applying to the woman what is expressly said of the man, understanding both sexes to be included under the general term \"man?\" For certainly in the saying, \"Blessed is he who feareth the Lord,\"[fn-44-P4460_2456215:44-nf] women also who fear the Lord are included.","title":"Book XXII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_23_book_xii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"And the mode in which they logically maintain their profanity is as follows;-that either by the relative term employed there is expressed community of essence also between the disciples and the Father, or else we must not by this phrase bring even the Lord into communion in the Father's Nature, and that, even as the fact[fn-20-P2093_1267629:7-nf] that the God over all is named as their God implies that the disciples are His servants so by parity of reasoning, it is acknowledged, by the words in question, that the Son also is the servant of God. Now that the words addressed to Mary are not applicable to the Godhead of the Only-begotten, one may learn from the intention with which they were uttered. For He Who humbled Himself to a level with human littleness, He it is Who spake the words. And what is the meaning of what He then uttered, they may know in all its fulness who by the Spirit search out the depths of the sacred mystery. But as much as comes within our compass we will set down in few words, following the guidance of the Fathers. He Who is by nature Father of existent things, from Whom all things have their birth, has been proclaimed as one, by the sublime utterance of the Apostle. \"For there is one God,\" he says, \"and Father, of Whom are all things[fn-20-P2094_1268713:8-nf] .\" Accordingly human nature did not enter into the creation from any other source, nor grow spontaneously in the parents of the race, but it too had for the author of its own constitution none other than the Father of all. And the name of Godhead itself, whether it indicates the authority of oversight or of foresight[fn-20-P2095_1269055:9-nf] , imports a certain relation to humanity. For He Who bestowed on all things that are, the power of being, is the God and overseer of what He has Himself produced. But since, by the wiles of him that sowed in us the tares of disobedience, our nature no longer preserved in itself the impress of the Father's image, but was transformed into the foul likeness of sin, for this cause it was engrafted by virtue of similarity of will into the evil family of the father of sin: so that the good and true God and Father was no longer the God and Father of him who had been thus outlawed by his own depravity, but instead of Him Who was by Nature God, those were honoured who, as the Apostle says, \"by nature were no Gods[fn-20-P2096_1269960:10-nf] ,\" and in the place of the Father, he was deemed father who is falsely so called, as the prophet Jeremiah says in his dark saying, \"The partridge called, she gathered together what she hatched not[fn-20-P2097_1270174:11-nf] .\" Since, then, this was the sum of our calamity, that humanity was exiled from the good Father, and was banished from the Divine oversight and care, for this cause He Who is the Shepherd of the whole rational creation, left in the heights of heaven His unsinning and supramundane flock, and, moved by love, went after the sheep which had gone astray, even our human nature[fn-20-P2098_1270575:12-nf] . For human nature, which alone, according to the similitude in the parable, through vice roamed away from the hundred of rational beings, is, if it be compared with the whole, but an insignificant and infinitesimal part. Since then it was impossible that our life, which had been estranged from God, should of itself return to the high and heavenly place, for this cause, as saith the Apostle, He Who knew no sin is made sin for us[fn-20-P2099_1271124:13-nf] , and frees us from the curse by taking on Him our curse as His own[fn-21-P2100_1271215:14-nf] , and having taken up, and, in the language of the Apostle, \"slain\" in Himself \"the enmity[fn-21-P2101_1271328:15-nf] \" which by means of sin had come between us and God,-(in fact sin was \"the enmity\")-and having become what we were, He through Himself again united humanity to God. For having by purity brought into closest relationship with the Father of our nature that new man which is created after God[fn-21-P2102_1271640:16-nf] , in Whom dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead bodily[fn-21-P2103_1271716:17-nf] , He drew with Him into the same grace all the nature that partakes of His body and is akin to Him. And these glad tidings He proclaims through the woman, not to those disciples only, but also to all who up to the present day become disciples of the Word,-the tidings, namely, that man is no longer outlawed, nor cast out of the kingdom of God, but is once more a son, once more in the station assigned to him by his God, inasmuch as along with the first-fruits of humanity the lump also is hallowed[fn-21-P2104_1272237:18-nf] . \"For behold,\" He says, \"I and the children whom God hath given Me[fn-21-P2105_1272327:19-nf] .\" He Who for our sakes was partaker of flesh and blood has recovered you, and brought you back to the place whence ye strayed away, becoming mere flesh and blood by sin[fn-21-P2106_1272542:20-nf] . And so He from Whom we were formerly alienated by our revolt has become our Father and our God. Accordingly in the passage cited above the Lord brings the glad tidings of this benefit. And the words are not a proof of the degradation of the Son, but the glad tidings of our reconciliation to God. For that which has taken place in Christ's Humanity is a common boon bestowed on mankind generally. For as when we see in Him the weight of the body, which naturally gravitates to earth, ascending through the air into the heavens, we believe according to the words of the Apostle, that we also \"shall be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air[fn-21-P2107_1273219:21-nf] ,\" even so, when we hear that the true God and Father has become the God and Father of our First-fruits, we no longer doubt that the same God has become our God and Father too, inasmuch as we have learnt hat we shall come to the same place whither Christ has entered for us as our forerunner[fn-21-P2108_1273533:22-nf] . And the fact too that this grace was revealed by means of a woman, itself agrees with the interpretation which we have given For since, as the Apostle tells us, \"the woman, being deceived, was in the transgression[fn-21-P2109_1273771:23-nf] ,\" and was by her disobedience foremost in the revolt from God, for this cause she is the first witness of the resurrection, that she might retrieve by her faith in the resurrection the overthrow caused by her disobedience, and that as, by making herself at the beginning a minister and advocate to her husband of the counsels of the serpent, she brought into human life the beginning of evil, and its train of consequences, so, by ministering[fn-21-P2110_1274235:24-nf] to His disciples the words of Him Who slew the rebel dragon, she might become to men the guide to faith, whereby with good reason the first proclamation of death is annulled. It is likely, indeed, that by more diligent students a more profitable explanation of the text may be discovered. But even though none such should be found, I think that every devout reader will agree that the one advanced by our opponents is futile, after comparing it with that which we have brought forward. For the one has been fabricated to destroy the glory of the Only-begotten, and nothing more: but the other includes in its scope the aim of the dispensation concerning man. For it has been shown that it was not the intangible, immutable, and invisible God, but the moving, visible, and tangible nature which is proper to humanity, that gave command to Mary to minister the word to His disciples.","title":"Book XII","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":4,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_24_book_vi_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"60","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"The presidents of the churches now resumed the agitation of doctrinal questions and discussions.[fn-40-P4007_1762936:10-nf] They had remained quiet during the reign of Julian when Christianity itself was endangered, and had unanimously offered up their supplications for the mercy of God.

The Huns, it is said, were unknown to the Thracians of the Ister and the Goths before this period; for though they were dwelling secretly near to one another, a lake of vast extent was between them, and the inhabitants on each side of the lake respectively imagined that their own country was situated at the extremity of the earth, and that there was nothing beyond them but the sea and water. It so happened, however, that an ox, tormented by insects, plunged into the lake, and was pursued by the herdsman; who, perceiving for the first time that the opposite bank was inhabited, made known the circumstance to his fellow-tribesmen. Some, however, relate that a stag was fleeing, and showed some of the hunters who were of the race of the Hurts the way which was concealed superficially by the water. On arriving at the opposite bank, the hunters were struck with the beauty of the country, the serenity of the air, and the adaptedness for cultivation; and they reported what they had seen to their king. The Huns then made an attempt to attack the Goths with a few soldiers; but they afterwards raised a powerful army, conquered the Goths in battle, and took possession of their whole country. The vanquished nation, being pursued by their enemies, crossed over into the Roman territories. They passed over the river, and dispatched an embassy to the emperor, assuring him of their co-operation in any warfare in which he might engage, provided that he would assign a portion of land for them to inhabit. Ulphilas, the bishop of the nation, was the chief of the embassy. The object of his embassy was fully accomplished, and the Goths were permitted to take up their abode in Thrace. Soon after contentions broke out among them, which led to their division into two parts, one of which was headed by Athanaric, and the other by Phritigernes. They took up arms against each other, and Phritigernes was vanquished, and implored the assistance of the Romans. The emperor having commanded the troops in Thrace to assist and to ally with him, a second battle was fought, and Athanaric and his party were put to flight. In acknowledgment of the timely succor afforded by Valens, and in proof of his fidelity to the Romans, Phritigernes embraced the religion of the emperor, and persuaded the barbarians over whom he ruled to follow his example. It does not, however, appear to me that this is the only reason that can be advanced to account for the Goths having retained, even to the present day, the tenets of Arianism. For Ulphilas, their bishop, originally held no opinions at variance with those of the Catholic Church; for during the reign of Constantius, though he took part, as I am convinced, from thoughtlessness, at the council of Constantinople, in conjunction with Eudoxius and Acacius, yet he did not swerve from the doctrines of the Nicaean council. He afterwards, it appears, returned to Constantinople, and, it is said, entered into disputations on doctrinal topics with the chiefs of the Arian faction; and they promised to lay his requests before the emperor, and forward the object of his embassy, if he would conform to their opinions. Compelled by the urgency of the occasion, or, possibly, thinking that it was better to hold such views concerning the Divine nature, Ulphilas entered into communion with the Arians, and separated himself and his whole nation from all connection with the Catholic Church. For as he had instructed the Goths in the elements of religion, and through him they shared in a gentler mode of life, they placed the most implicit confidence in his directions, and were firmly convinced that he could neither do nor say anything that was evil. He had, in fact, given many signal proofs of the greatness of his virtue. He had exposed himself to innumerable perils in defense of the faith, during the period that the aforesaid barbarians were given to pagan worship. He taught them the use of letters, and translated the Sacred Scriptures into their own language. It was on this account, that the barbarians on the banks of the Ister followed the tenets of Arius. At the same period, there were many of the subjects of Phritigernes who testified to Christ, and were martyred. Athanaric resented that his subjects had become Christian under the persuasion of Ulphilas; and because they had abandoned the cult of their fathers, he subjected many individuals to many punishments; some he put to death after they had been dragged before tribunals and had nobly confessed the doctrine, and others were slain without being permitted to utter a single word in their own defense. It is said that the officers appointed by Athanaric to execute his cruel mandates, caused a statute to be constructed, which they placed on a chariot, and had it conveyed to the tents of those who were suspected of having embraced Christianity, and who were therefore commanded to worship the statue and offer sacrifice; if they refused to do so, the men and the tents were burnt together. But I have heard that an outrage of still greater atrocity was perpetrated at this period. Many refused to obey those who were compelling them by force to sacrifice. Among them were men and women; of the latter some were leading their little children, others were nourishing their new-born infants at the breast; they fled to their church, which was a tent. The pagans set fire to it, and all were destroyed.","title":"Book VI.","author":"Hermias Sozomen"},{"chapter":4,"verse":37,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_24_book_vi_","source_chapter":38,"source_paragraph":"228","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"This remarkable oration of Themistius disposed the emperor to be somewhat more humane, and the punishments became in consequence less severe than before.

The Huns, it is said, were unknown to the Thracians of the Ister and the Goths before this period; for though they were dwelling secretly near to one another, a lake of vast extent was between them, and the inhabitants on each side of the lake respectively imagined that their own country was situated at the extremity of the earth, and that there was nothing beyond them but the sea and water. It so happened, however, that an ox, tormented by insects, plunged into the lake, and was pursued by the herdsman; who, perceiving for the first time that the opposite bank was inhabited, made known the circumstance to his fellow-tribesmen. Some, however, relate that a stag was fleeing, and showed some of the hunters who were of the race of the Hurts the way which was concealed superficially by the water. On arriving at the opposite bank, the hunters were struck with the beauty of the country, the serenity of the air, and the adaptedness for cultivation; and they reported what they had seen to their king. The Huns then made an attempt to attack the Goths with a few soldiers; but they afterwards raised a powerful army, conquered the Goths in battle, and took possession of their whole country. The vanquished nation, being pursued by their enemies, crossed over into the Roman territories. They passed over the river, and dispatched an embassy to the emperor, assuring him of their co-operation in any warfare in which he might engage, provided that he would assign a portion of land for them to inhabit. Ulphilas, the bishop of the nation, was the chief of the embassy. The object of his embassy was fully accomplished, and the Goths were permitted to take up their abode in Thrace. Soon after contentions broke out among them, which led to their division into two parts, one of which was headed by Athanaric, and the other by Phritigernes. They took up arms against each other, and Phritigernes was vanquished, and implored the assistance of the Romans. The emperor having commanded the troops in Thrace to assist and to ally with him, a second battle was fought, and Athanaric and his party were put to flight. In acknowledgment of the timely succor afforded by Valens, and in proof of his fidelity to the Romans, Phritigernes embraced the religion of the emperor, and persuaded the barbarians over whom he ruled to follow his example. It does not, however, appear to me that this is the only reason that can be advanced to account for the Goths having retained, even to the present day, the tenets of Arianism. For Ulphilas, their bishop, originally held no opinions at variance with those of the Catholic Church; for during the reign of Constantius, though he took part, as I am convinced, from thoughtlessness, at the council of Constantinople, in conjunction with Eudoxius and Acacius, yet he did not swerve from the doctrines of the Nicaean council. He afterwards, it appears, returned to Constantinople, and, it is said, entered into disputations on doctrinal topics with the chiefs of the Arian faction; and they promised to lay his requests before the emperor, and forward the object of his embassy, if he would conform to their opinions. Compelled by the urgency of the occasion, or, possibly, thinking that it was better to hold such views concerning the Divine nature, Ulphilas entered into communion with the Arians, and separated himself and his whole nation from all connection with the Catholic Church. For as he had instructed the Goths in the elements of religion, and through him they shared in a gentler mode of life, they placed the most implicit confidence in his directions, and were firmly convinced that he could neither do nor say anything that was evil. He had, in fact, given many signal proofs of the greatness of his virtue. He had exposed himself to innumerable perils in defense of the faith, during the period that the aforesaid barbarians were given to pagan worship.

The apostle, finally, when he would speak of charity, joined to it endurance and patience. \"Charity,\" he says, \"is large-souled; charity is kind; charity envieth not, is not puffed up, is not provoked, thinketh not evil; loveth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, beareth all things.\"[fn-76-P7624_2557637:35-nf] Thence he shows that it can tenaciously persevere, because it knows how to endure all things.

What shall I say of anger, of discord, of strife, which things ought not to be found in a Christian? Let there be patience in the breast, and these things cannot have place there; or should they try to enter, they are quickly excluded and depart, that a peaceful abode may continue in the heart, where it delights the God of peace to dwell. Finally, the apostle warns us, and teaches, saying: \"Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, in whom ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.

He adds: \"Because of the angels.\"[fn-75-P7511_2155827:343-nf] What angels? In other words, whose angels? If he means the fallen angels of the Creator,[fn-75-P7512_2155938:344-nf] there is great propriety in his meaning. It is right that that face which was a snare to them should wear some mark of a humble guise and obscured beauty. If, however, the angels of the rival god are referred to, what fear is there for them? for not even Marcion's disciples, (to say nothing of his angels, ) have any desire for women. We have often shown before now, that the apostle classes heresies as evil[fn-75-P7513_2156431:345-nf] among \"works of the flesh,\" and that he would have those persons accounted estimable[fn-75-P7514_2156542:346-nf] who shun heresies as an evil thing. In like manner, when treating of the gospel,[fn-75-P7515_2156654:347-nf] we have proved from the sacrament of the bread and the cup[fn-75-P7516_2156753:348-nf] the verity of the Lord's body and blood in opposition to Marcion's phantom; whilst throughout almost the whole of my work it has been contended that all mention of judicial attributes points conclusively to the Creator as to a God who judges. Now, on the subject of \"spiritual gifts,\"[fn-75-P7517_2157084:349-nf] I have to remark that these also were promised by the Creator through Christ; and I think that we may derive from this a very just conclusion that the bestowal of a gift is not the work of a god other than Him who is proved to have given the promise. Here is a prophecy of Isaiah \"There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a flower[fn-75-P7518_2157455:350-nf] shall spring up from his root; and upon Him shall rest the Spirit of the Lord.\" After which he enumerates the special gifts of the same \"The spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of religion.[fn-75-P7519_2157733:351-nf] And with the fear of the Lord[fn-75-P7520_2157801:352-nf] shall the Spirit fill Him.\"[fn-75-P7521_2157867:353-nf] In this figure of a flower he shows that Christ was to arise out of the rod which sprang from the stem of Jesse; in other words, from the virgin of the race of David, the son of Jesse. In this Christ the whole substantia of the Spirit would have to rest, not meaning that it would be as it were some subsequent acquisition accruing to Him who was always, even before His incarnation, the Spirit of God;[fn-75-P7522_2158291:354-nf] so that you cannot argue from this that the prophecy has reference to that Christ who (as mere man of the race only of David) was to obtain the Spirit of his God. (The prophet says, ) on the contrary, that from the time when (the true Christ) should appear in the flesh as the flower predicted,[fn-75-P7523_2158731:355-nf] rising from the root of Jesse, there would have to rest upon Him the entire operation of the Spirit of grace, which, so far as the Jews were concerned, would cease and come to an end. This result the case itself shows; for after this time the Spirit of the Creator never breathed amongst them. From Judah were taken away \"the wise man, and the cunning artificer, and the counsellor, and the prophet; \"[fn-75-P7524_2159162:356-nf] that so it might prove true that \"the law and the prophets were until John.\"[fn-75-P7525_2159266:357-nf] Now hear how he declared that by Christ Himself, when returned to heaven, these spiritual gifts were to be sent: \"He ascended up. on high,\" that is, into heaven; \"He led captivity captive,\" meaning death or slavery of man; \"He gave gifts to the sons of men,\"[fn-75-P7526_2159546:358-nf] that is, the gratuities, which we call charismata. He says specifically \"sons of men,\"[fn-75-P7527_2159690:359-nf] and not men promiscuously; thus exhibiting to us those who were the children of men truly so called, choice men, apostles. \"For,\" says he, \"I have begotten you through the gospel; \"[fn-75-P7528_2159927:360-nf] and \"Ye are my children, of whom I travail again in birth.\"[fn-75-P7529_2160009:361-nf] Now was absolutely fulfilled that promise of the Spirit which was given by the word of Joel: \"In the last days will I pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and their sons and their daughters shall prophesy; and upon my servants and upon my handmaids will I pour out of my Spirit.\"[fn-75-P7530_2160310:362-nf] Since, then, the Creator promised the gift of His Spirit in the latter days; and since Christ has in these last days appeared as the dispenser of spiritual gifts (as the apostle says, \"When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son; \"[fn-75-P7531_2160624:363-nf] and again, \"This I say, brethren, that the time is short\"[fn-75-P7532_2160701:364-nf] ), it evidently follows in connection with this prediction of the last days, that this gift of the Spirit belongs to Him who is the Christ of the predicters. Now compare the Spirit's specific graces, as they are described by the apostle, and promised by the prophet Isaiah. \"To one is given,\" says he, \"by the Spirit the word of wisdom; \"this we see at once is what Isaiah declared to be \"the spirit of wisdom.\" \"To another, the word of knowledge; \"this will be \"the (prophet's) spirit of understanding and counsel.\" \"To another, faith by the same Spirit; \"this will be \"the spirit of religion and the fear of the Lord.\" \"To another, the gifts of healing, and to another the working of miracles; \"this will be \"the spirit of might.\" \"To another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another divers kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues; \"this will be \"the spirit of knowledge.\"[fn-75-P7533_2161674:365-nf] See how the apostle agrees with the prophet both in making the distribution of the one Spirit, and in interpreting His special graces. This, too, I may confidently say: he who has likened the unity of our body throughout its manifold and divers members to the compacting together of the various gifts of the Spirit,[fn-75-P7534_2162038:366-nf] shows also that there is but one Lord of the human body and of the Holy Spirit. This Spirit, (according to the apostle's showing, )[fn-75-P7535_2162223:367-nf] meant not[fn-75-P7536_2162301:368-nf] that the service[fn-75-P7537_2162335:369-nf] of these gifts should be in the body,[fn-75-P7538_2162389:370-nf] nor did He place them in the human body); and on the subject of the superiority of love[fn-75-P7539_2162534:371-nf] above all these gifts, He even taught the apostle that it was the chief commandment,[fn-75-P7540_2162653:372-nf] just as Christ has shown it to be: \"Thou shalt love the Lord with all thine heart and soul,[fn-75-P7541_2162788:373-nf] with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thine own self.\"[fn-75-P7542_2162898:374-nf] When he mentions the fact that \"it is written in the law,\"[fn-75-P7543_2162976:375-nf] how that the Creator would speak with other tongues and other lips, whilst confirming indeed the gift of tongues by such a mention, he yet cannot be thought to have affirmed that the gift was that of another god by his reference to the Creator's prediction.[fn-75-P7544_2163475:376-nf] In precisely the same manner,[fn-75-P7545_2163528:377-nf] when enjoining on women silence in the church, that they speak not for the mere sake[fn-75-P7546_2163627:378-nf] of learning[fn-75-P7547_2163663:379-nf] (although that even they have the right of prophesying, he has already shown[fn-75-P7548_2163767:380-nf] when he covers the woman that prophesies with a veil), he goes to the law for his sanction that woman should be under obedience.[fn-75-P7549_2163940:381-nf] Now this law, let me say once for all, he ought to have made no other acquaintance with, than to destroy it. But that we may now leave the subject of spiritual gifts, facts themselves will be enough to prove which of us acts rashly in claiming them for his God, and whether it is possible that they are opposed to our side, even if[fn-75-P7550_2164330:382-nf] the Creator promised them for His Christ who is not yet revealed, as being destined only for the Jews, to have their operations in His time, in His Christ, and among His people. Let Marcion then exhibit, as gifts of his god, some prophets, such as have not spoken by human sense, but with the Spirit of God, such as have both predicted things to come, and have made manifest[fn-75-P7551_2164765:383-nf] the secrets of the heart;[fn-75-P7552_2164811:384-nf] let him produce a psalm, a vision, a prayer[fn-75-P7553_2164878:385-nf] -only let it be by the Spirit,[fn-75-P7554_2164932:386-nf] in an ecstasy, that is, in a rapture,[fn-75-P7555_2165230:387-nf] whenever an interpretation of tongues has occurred to him; let him show to me also, that any woman of boastful tongue[fn-75-P7556_2165364:388-nf] in his community has ever prophesied from amongst those specially holy sisters of his. Now all these signs (of spiritual gifts) are forthcoming from my side without any difficulty, and they agree, too, with the rules, and the dispensations, and the instructions of the Creator; therefore without doubt the Christ, and the Spirit, and the apostle, belong severally[fn-75-P7557_2165747:389-nf] to my God. Here, then, is my frank avowal for any one who cares to require it.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":4,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"44","folder":"ANF-03","text":"\"The head of every man is Christ.\"[fn-75-P7506_2154731:338-nf] What Christ, if He is not the author of man? The head he has here put for authority; now \"authority\" will accrue to none else than the \"author.\" Of what man indeed is He the head? Surely of him concerning whom he adds soon afterwards: \"The man ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image of God.\"[fn-75-P7507_2155063:339-nf] Since then he is the image of the Creator (for He, when looking on Christ His Word, who was to become man, said, \"Let us make man in our own image, after our likeness\"[fn-75-P7508_2155252:340-nf] ), how can I possibly have another head but Him whose image I am? For if I am the image of the Creator there is no room in me for another head But wherefore \"ought the woman to have power over her head, because of the angels? \"[fn-75-P7509_2155499:341-nf] If it is because \"she was created for the man,\"[fn-75-P7510_2155569:342-nf] and taken out of the man, according to the Creator's purpose, then in this way too has the apostle maintained the discipline of that God from whose institution he explains the reasons of His discipline. He adds: \"Because of the angels.\"[fn-75-P7511_2155827:343-nf] What angels? In other words, whose angels? If he means the fallen angels of the Creator,[fn-75-P7512_2155938:344-nf] there is great propriety in his meaning. It is right that that face which was a snare to them should wear some mark of a humble guise and obscured beauty. If, however, the angels of the rival god are referred to, what fear is there for them? for not even Marcion's disciples, (to say nothing of his angels, ) have any desire for women. We have often shown before now, that the apostle classes heresies as evil[fn-75-P7513_2156431:345-nf] among \"works of the flesh,\" and that he would have those persons accounted estimable[fn-75-P7514_2156542:346-nf] who shun heresies as an evil thing. In like manner, when treating of the gospel,[fn-75-P7515_2156654:347-nf] we have proved from the sacrament of the bread and the cup[fn-75-P7516_2156753:348-nf] the verity of the Lord's body and blood in opposition to Marcion's phantom; whilst throughout almost the whole of my work it has been contended that all mention of judicial attributes points conclusively to the Creator as to a God who judges. Now, on the subject of \"spiritual gifts,\"[fn-75-P7517_2157084:349-nf] I have to remark that these also were promised by the Creator through Christ; and I think that we may derive from this a very just conclusion that the bestowal of a gift is not the work of a god other than Him who is proved to have given the promise. Here is a prophecy of Isaiah \"There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a flower[fn-75-P7518_2157455:350-nf] shall spring up from his root; and upon Him shall rest the Spirit of the Lord.\" After which he enumerates the special gifts of the same \"The spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of religion.[fn-75-P7519_2157733:351-nf] And with the fear of the Lord[fn-75-P7520_2157801:352-nf] shall the Spirit fill Him.\"[fn-75-P7521_2157867:353-nf] In this figure of a flower he shows that Christ was to arise out of the rod which sprang from the stem of Jesse; in other words, from the virgin of the race of David, the son of Jesse. In this Christ the whole substantia of the Spirit would have to rest, not meaning that it would be as it were some subsequent acquisition accruing to Him who was always, even before His incarnation, the Spirit of God;[fn-75-P7522_2158291:354-nf] so that you cannot argue from this that the prophecy has reference to that Christ who (as mere man of the race only of David) was to obtain the Spirit of his God. (The prophet says, ) on the contrary, that from the time when (the true Christ) should appear in the flesh as the flower predicted,[fn-75-P7523_2158731:355-nf] rising from the root of Jesse, there would have to rest upon Him the entire operation of the Spirit of grace, which, so far as the Jews were concerned, would cease and come to an end. This result the case itself shows; for after this time the Spirit of the Creator never breathed amongst them. From Judah were taken away \"the wise man, and the cunning artificer, and the counsellor, and the prophet; \"[fn-75-P7524_2159162:356-nf] that so it might prove true that \"the law and the prophets were until John.\"[fn-75-P7525_2159266:357-nf] Now hear how he declared that by Christ Himself, when returned to heaven, these spiritual gifts were to be sent: \"He ascended up. on high,\" that is, into heaven; \"He led captivity captive,\" meaning death or slavery of man; \"He gave gifts to the sons of men,\"[fn-75-P7526_2159546:358-nf] that is, the gratuities, which we call charismata.

This, too, I may confidently say: he who has likened the unity of our body throughout its manifold and divers members to the compacting together of the various gifts of the Spirit,[fn-75-P7534_2162038:366-nf] shows also that there is but one Lord of the human body and of the Holy Spirit.

This Spirit, (according to the apostle's showing, )[fn-75-P7535_2162223:367-nf] meant not[fn-75-P7536_2162301:368-nf] that the service[fn-75-P7537_2162335:369-nf] of these gifts should be in the body,[fn-75-P7538_2162389:370-nf] nor did He place them in the human body); and on the subject of the superiority of love[fn-75-P7539_2162534:371-nf] above all these gifts, He even taught the apostle that it was the chief commandment,[fn-75-P7540_2162653:372-nf] just as Christ has shown it to be: \"Thou shalt love the Lord with all thine heart and soul,[fn-75-P7541_2162788:373-nf] with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thine own self.\"[fn-75-P7542_2162898:374-nf] When he mentions the fact that \"it is written in the law,\"[fn-75-P7543_2162976:375-nf] how that the Creator would speak with other tongues and other lips, whilst confirming indeed the gift of tongues by such a mention, he yet cannot be thought to have affirmed that the gift was that of another god by his reference to the Creator's prediction.[fn-75-P7544_2163475:376-nf] In precisely the same manner,[fn-75-P7545_2163528:377-nf] when enjoining on women silence in the church, that they speak not for the mere sake[fn-75-P7546_2163627:378-nf] of learning[fn-75-P7547_2163663:379-nf] (although that even they have the right of prophesying, he has already shown[fn-75-P7548_2163767:380-nf] when he covers the woman that prophesies with a veil), he goes to the law for his sanction that woman should be under obedience.[fn-75-P7549_2163940:381-nf] Now this law, let me say once for all, he ought to have made no other acquaintance with, than to destroy it. But that we may now leave the subject of spiritual gifts, facts themselves will be enough to prove which of us acts rashly in claiming them for his God, and whether it is possible that they are opposed to our side, even if[fn-75-P7550_2164330:382-nf] the Creator promised them for His Christ who is not yet revealed, as being destined only for the Jews, to have their operations in His time, in His Christ, and among His people. Let Marcion then exhibit, as gifts of his god, some prophets, such as have not spoken by human sense, but with the Spirit of God, such as have both predicted things to come, and have made manifest[fn-75-P7551_2164765:383-nf] the secrets of the heart;[fn-75-P7552_2164811:384-nf] let him produce a psalm, a vision, a prayer[fn-75-P7553_2164878:385-nf] -only let it be by the Spirit,[fn-75-P7554_2164932:386-nf] in an ecstasy, that is, in a rapture,[fn-75-P7555_2165230:387-nf] whenever an interpretation of tongues has occurred to him; let him show to me also, that any woman of boastful tongue[fn-75-P7556_2165364:388-nf] in his community has ever prophesied from amongst those specially holy sisters of his. Now all these signs (of spiritual gifts) are forthcoming from my side without any difficulty, and they agree, too, with the rules, and the dispensations, and the instructions of the Creator; therefore without doubt the Christ, and the Spirit, and the apostle, belong severally[fn-75-P7557_2165747:389-nf] to my God. Here, then, is my frank avowal for any one who cares to require it.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":4,"verse":5,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Let us now return to the resurrection, to the defence of which against heretics of all sorts we have given indeed sufficient attention in another work of ours.[fn-76-P7609_2179677:435-nf] But we will not be wanting (in some defence of the doctrine) even here, in consideration of such persons as are ignorant of that little treatise. \"What,\" asks he, \"shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not? \"[fn-76-P7610_2179974:436-nf] Now, never mind[fn-76-P7611_2180012:437-nf] that practice, (whatever it may have been.)

His only aim in alluding to it was) that he might all the more firmly insist upon the resurrection of the body, in proportion as they who were vainly baptized for the dead resorted to the practice from their belief of such a resurrection. We have the apostle in another passage defining \"but one baptism.\"[fn-76-P7615_2182023:441-nf] To be \"baptized for the dead\" therefore means, in fact, to be baptized for the body;[fn-76-P7616_2182127:442-nf] for, as we have shown, it is the body which becomes dead. What, then, shall they do who are baptized for the body,[fn-76-P7617_2182266:443-nf] if the body[fn-76-P7618_2182297:444-nf] rises not again? We stand, then, on firm ground (when we say) that[fn-76-P7619_2182380:445-nf] the next question which the apostle has discussed equally relates to the body. But \"some man will say, `How are the dead raised up? With what body do they come? '\"[fn-76-P7620_2182592:446-nf] Having established the doctrine of the resurrection which was denied, it was natural[fn-76-P7621_2182699:447-nf] to discuss what would be the sort of body (in the resurrection), of which no one had an idea. On this point we have other opponents with whom to engage, For Marcion does not in any wise admit the resurrection of the flesh, and it is only the salvation of the soul which he promises; consequently the question which he raises is not concerning the sort of body, but the very substance thereof. Notwithstanding,[fn-76-P7622_2183133:448-nf] he is most plainly refuted even from what the apostle advances respecting the quality of the body, in answer to those who ask, \"How are the dead raised up? with what body do they come? \"For as he treated of the sort of body, he of course ipso facto proclaimed in the argument that it was a body which would rise again. Indeed, since he proposes as his examples \"wheat grain, or some other grain, to which God giveth a body, such as it hath pleased Him; \"[fn-76-P7623_2183602:449-nf] since also he says, that \"to every seed is its own body; \"[fn-76-P7624_2183687:450-nf] that, consequently,[fn-76-P7625_2183729:451-nf] \"there is one kind of flesh of men, whilst there is another of beasts, and (another) of birds; that there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial; and that there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars\"[fn-76-P7626_2183999:452-nf] -does he not therefore intimate that there is to be[fn-76-P7627_2184076:453-nf] a resurrection of the flesh or body, which he illustrates by fleshly and corporeal samples? Does he not also guarantee that the resurrection shall be accomplished by that God from whom proceed all the (creatures which have served him for) examples? \"So also,\" says he, \"is the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-76-P7628_2184398:454-nf] How? Just as the grain, which is sown a body, springs up a body. This sowing of the body he called the dissolving thereof in the ground, \"because it is sown in corruption,\" (but \"is raised) to honour and power.\"[fn-76-P7629_2184632:455-nf] Now, just as in the case of the grain, so here: to Him will belong the work in the revival of the body, who ordered the process in the dissolution thereof. If, however, you remove the body from the resurrection which you submitted to the dissolution, what becomes of the diversity in the issue? Likewise, \"although it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.\"[fn-76-P7630_2185032:456-nf] Now, although the natural principle of life[fn-76-P7631_2185098:457-nf] and the spirit have each a body proper to itself, so that the \"natural body\" may fairly be taken[fn-76-P7632_2185246:458-nf] to signify the soul,[fn-76-P7633_2185289:459-nf] and \"the spiritual body\" the spirit, yet that is no reason for supposing[fn-76-P7634_2185377:460-nf] the apostle to say that the soul is to become spirit in the resurrection, but that the body (which, as being born along with the soul, and as retaining its life by means of the soul,[fn-76-P7635_2185577:461-nf] admits of being called animal (or natural[fn-76-P7636_2185634:462-nf] ) will became spiritual, since it rises through the Spirit to an eternal life. In short, since it is not the soul, but the flesh which is \"sown in corruption,\" when it turns to decay in the ground, it follows that (after such dissolution) the soul is no longer the natural body, but the flesh, which was the natural body, (is the subject of the future change), forasmuch as of a natural body it is made a spiritual body, as he says further down, \"That was not first which is spiritual.\"[fn-76-P7637_2186391:463-nf] For to this effect he just before remarked of Christ Himself: \"The first man Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.\"[fn-76-P7638_2186564:464-nf] Our heretic, however, in the excess of his folly, being unwilling that the statement should remain in this shape, altered \"last Adam\" into \"last Lord; \"[fn-76-P7639_2186739:465-nf] because he feared, of course, that if he allowed the Lord to be the last (or second) Adam, we should contend that Christ, being the second Adam, must needs belong to that God who owned also the first Adam. But the falsification is transparent. For why is there a first Adam, unless it be that there is also a second Adam? For things are not classed together unless they be severally alike, and have an identity of either name, or substance, or origin.[fn-76-P7640_2187243:466-nf] Now, although among things which are even individually diverse, one must be first and another last, yet they must have one author. If, however, the author be a different one, he himself indeed may be called the last. But the thing which he introduces is the first, and that only can be the last, which is like this first in nature.[fn-76-P7641_2187597:467-nf] It is, however, not like the first in nature, when it is not the work of the same author. In like manner (the heretic) will be refuted also with the word \"man: \" \"The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.\"[fn-76-P7642_2187852:468-nf] Now, since the first was a man, how can there be a second, unless he is a man also? Or, else, if the second is \"Lord,\" was the first \"Lord\" also?[fn-76-P7643_2188020:469-nf] It is, however, quite enough for me, that in his Gospel he admits the Son of man to be both Christ and Man; so that he will not be able to deny Him (in this passage), in the \"Adam\" and the \"man\" (of the apostle). What follows will also be too much for him. For when the apostle says, \"As is the earthy,\" that is, man, \"such also are they that are earthy\"-men again, of course; \"therefore as is the heavenly,\" meaning the Man, from heaven, \"such are the men also that are heavenly.\"[fn-76-P7644_2188772:470-nf] For he could not possibly have opposed to earthly men any heavenly beings that were not men also; his object being the more accurately to distinguish their state and expectation by using this name in common for them both. For in respect of their present state and their future expectation he calls men earthly and heavenly, still reserving their parity of name, according as they are reckoned (as to their ultimate conditions[fn-76-P7645_2189328:471-nf] ) in Adam or in Christ. Therefore, when exhorting them to cherish the hope of heaven, he says: \"As we have borne the image of the earthy, so let us also bear the image of the heavenly,\"[fn-76-P7646_2189538:472-nf] -language which relates not to any condition of resurrection life, but to the rule of the present time. He says, Let us bear, as a precept; not We shall bear, in the sense of a promise-wishing us to walk even as he himself was walking, and to put off the likeness of the earthly, that is, of the old man, in the works of the flesh. For what are this next words? \"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-76-P7647_2190535:473-nf] He means the works of the flesh and blood, which, in his Epistle to the Galatians, deprive men of the kingdom of God.[fn-76-P7648_2190675:474-nf] In other passages also he is accustomed to put the natural condition instead of the works that are done therein, as when he says, that \"they who are in the flesh cannot please God.\"[fn-76-P7649_2190879:475-nf] Now, when shall we be able to please God except whilst we are in this flesh? There is, I imagine, no other time wherein a man can work. If, however, whilst we are even naturally living in the flesh, we yet eschew the deeds of the flesh, then we shall not be in the flesh; since, although we are not absent from the substance of the flesh, we are notwithstanding strangers to the sin thereof. Now, since in the word flesh we are enjoined to put off, not the substance, but the works of the flesh, therefore in the use of the same word the kingdom of God is denied to the works of the flesh, not to the substance thereof. For not that is condemned in which evil is done, but only the evil which is done in it. To administer poison is a crime, but the cup in which it is given is not guilty. So the body is the vessel of the works of the flesh, whilst the soul which is within it mixes the poison of a wicked act. How then is it, that the soul, which is the real author of the works of the flesh, shall attain to[fn-76-P7650_2191910:476-nf] the kingdom of God, after the deeds done in the body have been stoned for, whilst the body, which was nothing but (the soul's) ministering agent, must remain in condemnation? Is the cup to be punished, but the poisoner to escape? Not that we indeed claim the kingdom of God for the flesh: all we do is, to assert a resurrection for the substance thereof, as the gate of the kingdom through which it is entered. But the resurrection is one thing, and the kingdom is another. The resurrection is first, and afterwards the kingdom. We say, therefore, that the flesh rises again, but that when changed it obtains the kingdom. \"For the dead shall be raised incorruptible,\" even those who had been corruptible when their bodies fell into decay; \"and we shall be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.[fn-76-P7651_2192734:477-nf] For this corruptible\"-and as he spake, the apostle seemingly pointed to his own flesh-\"must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\"[fn-76-P7652_2192911:478-nf] in order, indeed, that it may be rendered a fit substance for the kingdom of God. \"For we shall be like the angels.\"[fn-76-P7653_2193050:479-nf] This will be the perfect change of our flesh-only after its resurrection.[fn-76-P7654_2193164:480-nf] Now if, on the contrary,[fn-76-P7655_2193214:481-nf] there is to be no flesh, how then shall it put on incorruption and immortality? Having then become something else by its change, it will obtain the kingdom of God, no longer the (old) flesh and blood, but the body which God shall have given it. Rightly then does the apostle declare, \"Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; \"[fn-76-P7656_2193567:482-nf] for this (honour) does he ascribe to the changed condition[fn-76-P7657_2193648:483-nf] which ensues on the resurrection. Since, therefore, shall then be accomplished the word which was written by the Creator, \"O death, where is thy victory\"-or thy struggle?[fn-76-P7658_2193839:484-nf] \"O death, where is thy sting? \"[fn-76-P7659_2193928:485-nf] -written, I say, by the Creator, for He wrote them by His prophet[fn-76-P7660_2194016:486-nf] -to Him will belong the gift, that is, the kingdom, who proclaimed the word which is to be accomplished in the kingdom. And to none other God does he tell us that \"thanks\" are due, for having enabled us to achieve \"the victory\" even over death, than to Him from whom he received the very expression[fn-76-P7661_2194366:487-nf] of the exulting and triumphant challenge to the mortal foe.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":4,"verse":5,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Let us now return to the resurrection, to the defence of which against heretics of all sorts we have given indeed sufficient attention in another work of ours.[fn-76-P7609_2179677:435-nf] But we will not be wanting (in some defence of the doctrine) even here, in consideration of such persons as are ignorant of that little treatise. \"What,\" asks he, \"shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not? \"[fn-76-P7610_2179974:436-nf] Now, never mind[fn-76-P7611_2180012:437-nf] that practice, (whatever it may have been.)

Therefore, when exhorting them to cherish the hope of heaven, he says: \"As we have borne the image of the earthy, so let us also bear the image of the heavenly,\"[fn-76-P7646_2189538:472-nf] -language which relates not to any condition of resurrection life, but to the rule of the present time. He says, Let us bear, as a precept; not We shall bear, in the sense of a promise-wishing us to walk even as he himself was walking, and to put off the likeness of the earthly, that is, of the old man, in the works of the flesh. For what are this next words? \"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-76-P7647_2190535:473-nf] He means the works of the flesh and blood, which, in his Epistle to the Galatians, deprive men of the kingdom of God.[fn-76-P7648_2190675:474-nf] In other passages also he is accustomed to put the natural condition instead of the works that are done therein, as when he says, that \"they who are in the flesh cannot please God.\"[fn-76-P7649_2190879:475-nf] Now, when shall we be able to please God except whilst we are in this flesh? There is, I imagine, no other time wherein a man can work. If, however, whilst we are even naturally living in the flesh, we yet eschew the deeds of the flesh, then we shall not be in the flesh; since, although we are not absent from the substance of the flesh, we are notwithstanding strangers to the sin thereof. Now, since in the word flesh we are enjoined to put off, not the substance, but the works of the flesh, therefore in the use of the same word the kingdom of God is denied to the works of the flesh, not to the substance thereof. For not that is condemned in which evil is done, but only the evil which is done in it. To administer poison is a crime, but the cup in which it is given is not guilty. So the body is the vessel of the works of the flesh, whilst the soul which is within it mixes the poison of a wicked act. How then is it, that the soul, which is the real author of the works of the flesh, shall attain to[fn-76-P7650_2191910:476-nf] the kingdom of God, after the deeds done in the body have been stoned for, whilst the body, which was nothing but (the soul's) ministering agent, must remain in condemnation? Is the cup to be punished, but the poisoner to escape? Not that we indeed claim the kingdom of God for the flesh: all we do is, to assert a resurrection for the substance thereof, as the gate of the kingdom through which it is entered. But the resurrection is one thing, and the kingdom is another. The resurrection is first, and afterwards the kingdom. We say, therefore, that the flesh rises again, but that when changed it obtains the kingdom. \"For the dead shall be raised incorruptible,\" even those who had been corruptible when their bodies fell into decay; \"and we shall be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.[fn-76-P7651_2192734:477-nf] For this corruptible\"-and as he spake, the apostle seemingly pointed to his own flesh-\"must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\"[fn-76-P7652_2192911:478-nf] in order, indeed, that it may be rendered a fit substance for the kingdom of God. \"For we shall be like the angels.\"[fn-76-P7653_2193050:479-nf] This will be the perfect change of our flesh-only after its resurrection.[fn-76-P7654_2193164:480-nf] Now if, on the contrary,[fn-76-P7655_2193214:481-nf] there is to be no flesh, how then shall it put on incorruption and immortality? Having then become something else by its change, it will obtain the kingdom of God, no longer the (old) flesh and blood, but the body which God shall have given it. Rightly then does the apostle declare, \"Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; \"[fn-76-P7656_2193567:482-nf] for this (honour) does he ascribe to the changed condition[fn-76-P7657_2193648:483-nf] which ensues on the resurrection. Since, therefore, shall then be accomplished the word which was written by the Creator, \"O death, where is thy victory\"-or thy struggle?[fn-76-P7658_2193839:484-nf] \"O death, where is thy sting? \"[fn-76-P7659_2193928:485-nf] -written, I say, by the Creator, for He wrote them by His prophet[fn-76-P7660_2194016:486-nf] -to Him will belong the gift, that is, the kingdom, who proclaimed the word which is to be accomplished in the kingdom. And to none other God does he tell us that \"thanks\" are due, for having enabled us to achieve \"the victory\" even over death, than to Him from whom he received the very expression[fn-76-P7661_2194366:487-nf] of the exulting and triumphant challenge to the mortal foe.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":4,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"64","folder":"ANF-03","text":"As our heretic is so fond of his pruning-knife, I do not wonder when syllables are expunged by his hand, seeing that entire pages are usually the matter on which he practises his effacing process.

If the Creator's, how does it come to pass that such a God as He could have meant His wisdom to be displayed to the principalities and powers, but not to Himself? For surely no principalities could possibly have understood anything without their sovereign Lord. Or if (the apostle) did not mention God in this passage, on the ground that He (as their chief) is Himself reckoned among these (principalities), then he would have plainly said that the mystery had been hidden from the principalities and powers of Him who had created all things, including Him amongst them. But if he states that it was hidden from them, he must needs be understood[fn-80-P8013_2280952:815-nf] as having meant that it was manifest to Him. From God, therefore, the mystery was not hidden; but it was hidden in God, the Creator of all things, from His principalities and powers. For \"who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been His counsellor? \"[fn-80-P8014_2281228:816-nf] Caught in this trap, the heretic probably changed the passage, with the view of saying that his god wished to make known to his principalities and powers the fellowship of his own mystery, of which God, who created all things, had been ignorant. But what was the use of his obtruding this ignorance of the Creator, who was a stranger to the superior god,[fn-80-P8015_2281603:817-nf] and far enough removed from him, when even his own servants had known nothing about him? To the Creator, however, the future was well known. Then why was not that also known to Him, which had to be revealed beneath His heaven, and on His earth? From this, therefore, there arises a confirmation of what we have already laid down. For since the Creator was sure to know, some time or other, that hidden mystery of the superior god, even on the supposition that the true reading was (as Marcion has it)-\"hidden from the God who created all things\"-he ought then to have expressed the conclusion thus: \"in order that the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to Him, and then to the principalities and powers of God, whosoever He might be, with whom the Creator was destined to share their knowledge.\" So palpable is the erasure in this passage, when thus read, consistently with its own true bearing. I, on my part, now wish to engage with you in a discussion on the allegorical expressions of the apostle. What figures of speech could the novel god have found in the prophets (fit for himself)? \"He led captivity captive,\" says the apostle.[fn-80-P8016_2282781:818-nf] With what arms? In what conflicts? From the devastation of what Country? From the overthrow of what city? What women, what children, what princes did the Conqueror throw into chains? For when by David Christ is sung as \"girded with His sword upon His thigh,\"[fn-80-P8017_2283078:819-nf] or by Isaiah as \"taking away the spoils of Samaria and the power of Damascus,\"[fn-80-P8018_2283176:820-nf] you make Him out to be[fn-80-P8019_2283220:821-nf] really and truly a warrior confest to the eye.[fn-80-P8020_2283284:822-nf] Learn then now, that His is a spiritual armour and warfare, since you have already discovered that the captivity is spiritual, in order that you may further learn that this also belongs to Him, even because the apostle derived the mention of the captivity from the same prophets as suggested to him his precepts likewise: \"Putting away lying,\" (says he, ) \"speak every man truth with his neighbour; \"[fn-80-P8021_2283742:823-nf] and again, using the very words in which the Psalm[fn-80-P8022_2283813:824-nf] expresses his meaning, (he says, ) \"Be ye angry, and sin not; \"[fn-80-P8023_2283895:825-nf] \"Let not the sun go down upon your wrath.\"[fn-80-P8024_2283958:826-nf] \"Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness; \"[fn-80-P8025_2284039:827-nf] for (in the Psalm it is written, ) \"With the holy man thou shalt be holy, and with the perverse thou shalt be perverse; \"[fn-80-P8026_2284180:828-nf] and, \"Thou shalt put away evil from among you.\"[fn-80-P8027_2284250:829-nf] Again, \"Go ye out from the midst of them; touch not the unclean thing; separate yourselves, ye that bear the vessels of the Lord.\"[fn-80-P8028_2284432:830-nf] (The apostle says further: ) \"Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess,\"[fn-80-P8029_2284552:831-nf] -a precept which is suggested by the passage (of the prophet), where the seducers of the consecrated (Nazarites) to drunkenness are rebuked: \"Ye gave wine to my holy ones to drink.\"[fn-80-P8030_2284753:832-nf] This prohibition from drink was given also to the high priest Aaron and his sons, \"when they went into the holy place.\"[fn-80-P8031_2284894:833-nf] The command, to \"sing to the Lord with psalms and hymns,\"[fn-80-P8032_2284970:834-nf] comes suitably from him who knew that those who \"drank wine with drums and psalteries\" were blamed by God.[fn-80-P8033_2285096:835-nf] Now, when I find to what God belong these precepts, whether in their germ or their development, I have no difficulty in knowing to whom the apostle also belongs. But he declares that \"wives ought to be in subjection to their husbands: \"[fn-80-P8034_2285357:836-nf] what reason does he give for this? \"Because,\" says he, \"the husband is the head of the wife.\"[fn-80-P8035_2285474:837-nf] Pray tell me, Marcion, does your god build up the authority of his law on the work of the Creator? This, however, is a comparative trifle; for he actually derives from the same source the condition of his Christ and his Church; for he says: \"even as Christ is the head of the Church; \"[fn-80-P8036_2285779:838-nf] and again, in like manner: \"He who loveth his wife, loveth his own flesh, even as Christ loved the Church.\"[fn-80-P8037_2285906:839-nf] You see how your Christ and your Church are put in comparison with the work of the Creator. How much honour is given to the flesh in the name of the church! \"No man,\" says the apostle, \"ever yet hated his own flesh\" (except, of course, Marcion alone), \"but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord doth the Church.\"[fn-80-P8038_2286251:840-nf] But you are the only man that hates his flesh, for you rob it of its resurrection. It will be only right that you should hate the Church also, because it is loved by Christ on the same principle.[fn-80-P8039_2286466:841-nf] Yea, Christ loved the flesh even as the Church. For no man will love the picture of his wife without taking care of it, and honouring it and crowning it. The likeness partakes with the reality in the privileged honour. I shall now endeavour, from my point of view,[fn-80-P8040_2286747:842-nf] to prove that the same God is (the God) of the man[fn-80-P8041_2286810:843-nf] and of Christ, of the woman and of the Church, of the flesh and the spirit, by the apostle's help who applies the Creator's injunction, and adds even a comment on it: \"For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother, (and shall be joined unto his wife), and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery.\"[fn-80-P8042_2287150:844-nf] In passing,[fn-80-P8043_2287185:845-nf] (I would say that) it is enough for me that the works of the Creator are great mysteries[fn-80-P8044_2287293:846-nf] in the estimation of the apostle, although they are so vilely esteemed by the heretics. \"But I am speaking,\" says he, \"of Christ and the Church.\"[fn-80-P8045_2287464:847-nf] This he says in explanation of the mystery, not for its disruption. He shows us that the mystery was prefigured by Him who is also the author of the mystery. Now what is Marcion's opinion? The Creator could not possibly have furnished figures to an unknown god, or, if a known one, an adversary to Himself. The superior god, in fact, ought to have borrowed nothing from the inferior; he was bound rather to annihilate Him. \"Children should obey their parents.\"[fn-80-P8046_2287944:848-nf] Now, although Marcion has erased (the next clause), \"which is the first commandment with promise,\"[fn-80-P8047_2288062:849-nf] still the law says plainly, \"Honour thy father and thy mother.\"[fn-80-P8048_2288248:850-nf] Again, (the apostle writes: ) \"Parents, bring up your children in the fear and admonition of the Lord.\"[fn-80-P8049_2288371:851-nf] For you have heard how it was said to them of old time: \"Ye shall relate these things to your children; and your children in like manner to their children.\"[fn-80-P8050_2288547:852-nf] Of what use are two gods to me, when the discipline is but one? If there must be two, I mean to follow Him who was the first to teach the lesson. But as our struggle lies against \"the rulers of this world,\"[fn-80-P8051_2288771:853-nf] what a host of Creator Gods there must be![fn-80-P8052_2288834:854-nf] For why should I not insist upon this point here, that he ought to have mentioned but one \"ruler of this world,\" if he meant only the Creator to be the being to whom belonged all the powers which he previously mentioned? Again, when in the preceding verse he bids us \"put on the whole armour of God, that we may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil,\"[fn-80-P8053_2289330:855-nf] does he not show that all the things which he mentions after the devil's name really belong to the devil-\"the principalities and the powers, and the tillers of the darkness of this world,\"[fn-80-P8054_2289539:856-nf] which we also ascribe to the devil's authority? Else, if \"the devil\" means the Creator, who will be the devil in the Creator's dispensation?[fn-80-P8055_2289700:857-nf] As there are two gods, must there also be two devils, and a plurality of powers and rulers of this world? But how is the Creator both a devil and a god at the same time, when the devil is not at once both god and devil? For either they are both of them gods, if both of them are devils; or else He who is God is not also devil, as neither is he god who is the devil. I want to know indeed by what perversion[fn-80-P8056_2290131:858-nf] the word devil is at all applicable to the Creator. Perhaps he perverted some purpose of the superior god-conduct such as He experienced Himself from the archangel, who lied indeed for the purpose. For He did not forbid (our first parents) a taste of the miserable tree,[fn-80-P8057_2290426:859-nf] from any apprehension that they would become gods; His prohibition was meant to prevent their dying after the transgression. But \"the spiritual wickedness\"[fn-80-P8058_2290609:860-nf] did not signify the Creator, because of the apostle's additional description, \"in heavenly places; \"[fn-80-P8059_2290757:861-nf] for the apostle was quite aware that \"spiritual wickedness\" had been at work in heavenly places, when angels were entrapped into sin by the daughters of men.[fn-80-P8060_2290934:862-nf] But how happened it that (the apostle) resorted to ambiguous descriptions, and I know not what obscure enigmas, for the purpose of disparaging[fn-80-P8061_2291240:863-nf] the Creator, when he displayed to the Church such constancy and plainness of speech in \"making known the mystery of the gospel for which he was an ambassador in bonds,\" owing to his liberty in preaching-and actually requested (the Ephesians) to pray to God that this \"open-mouthed utterance\" might be continued to him?[fn-80-P8062_2291718:864-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":4,"verse":25,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"64","folder":"ANF-03","text":"As our heretic is so fond of his pruning-knife, I do not wonder when syllables are expunged by his hand, seeing that entire pages are usually the matter on which he practises his effacing process.

This is a great mystery.\"[fn-80-P8042_2287150:844-nf] In passing,[fn-80-P8043_2287185:845-nf] (I would say that) it is enough for me that the works of the Creator are great mysteries[fn-80-P8044_2287293:846-nf] in the estimation of the apostle, although they are so vilely esteemed by the heretics. \"But I am speaking,\" says he, \"of Christ and the Church.\"[fn-80-P8045_2287464:847-nf] This he says in explanation of the mystery, not for its disruption. He shows us that the mystery was prefigured by Him who is also the author of the mystery. Now what is Marcion's opinion? The Creator could not possibly have furnished figures to an unknown god, or, if a known one, an adversary to Himself. The superior god, in fact, ought to have borrowed nothing from the inferior; he was bound rather to annihilate Him. \"Children should obey their parents.\"[fn-80-P8046_2287944:848-nf] Now, although Marcion has erased (the next clause), \"which is the first commandment with promise,\"[fn-80-P8047_2288062:849-nf] still the law says plainly, \"Honour thy father and thy mother.\"[fn-80-P8048_2288248:850-nf] Again, (the apostle writes: ) \"Parents, bring up your children in the fear and admonition of the Lord.\"[fn-80-P8049_2288371:851-nf] For you have heard how it was said to them of old time: \"Ye shall relate these things to your children; and your children in like manner to their children.\"[fn-80-P8050_2288547:852-nf] Of what use are two gods to me, when the discipline is but one?

Else, if \"the devil\" means the Creator, who will be the devil in the Creator's dispensation?[fn-80-P8055_2289700:857-nf] As there are two gods, must there also be two devils, and a plurality of powers and rulers of this world? But how is the Creator both a devil and a god at the same time, when the devil is not at once both god and devil? For either they are both of them gods, if both of them are devils; or else He who is God is not also devil, as neither is he god who is the devil. I want to know indeed by what perversion[fn-80-P8056_2290131:858-nf] the word devil is at all applicable to the Creator. Perhaps he perverted some purpose of the superior god-conduct such as He experienced Himself from the archangel, who lied indeed for the purpose. For He did not forbid (our first parents) a taste of the miserable tree,[fn-80-P8057_2290426:859-nf] from any apprehension that they would become gods; His prohibition was meant to prevent their dying after the transgression. But \"the spiritual wickedness\"[fn-80-P8058_2290609:860-nf] did not signify the Creator, because of the apostle's additional description, \"in heavenly places; \"[fn-80-P8059_2290757:861-nf] for the apostle was quite aware that \"spiritual wickedness\" had been at work in heavenly places, when angels were entrapped into sin by the daughters of men.[fn-80-P8060_2290934:862-nf] But how happened it that (the apostle) resorted to ambiguous descriptions, and I know not what obscure enigmas, for the purpose of disparaging[fn-80-P8061_2291240:863-nf] the Creator, when he displayed to the Church such constancy and plainness of speech in \"making known the mystery of the gospel for which he was an ambassador in bonds,\" owing to his liberty in preaching-and actually requested (the Ephesians) to pray to God that this \"open-mouthed utterance\" might be continued to him?[fn-80-P8062_2291718:864-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":4,"verse":26,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"64","folder":"ANF-03","text":"As our heretic is so fond of his pruning-knife, I do not wonder when syllables are expunged by his hand, seeing that entire pages are usually the matter on which he practises his effacing process.

If the Creator's, how does it come to pass that such a God as He could have meant His wisdom to be displayed to the principalities and powers, but not to Himself? For surely no principalities could possibly have understood anything without their sovereign Lord. Or if (the apostle) did not mention God in this passage, on the ground that He (as their chief) is Himself reckoned among these (principalities), then he would have plainly said that the mystery had been hidden from the principalities and powers of Him who had created all things, including Him amongst them. But if he states that it was hidden from them, he must needs be understood[fn-80-P8013_2280952:815-nf] as having meant that it was manifest to Him. From God, therefore, the mystery was not hidden; but it was hidden in God, the Creator of all things, from His principalities and powers. For \"who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been His counsellor? \"[fn-80-P8014_2281228:816-nf] Caught in this trap, the heretic probably changed the passage, with the view of saying that his god wished to make known to his principalities and powers the fellowship of his own mystery, of which God, who created all things, had been ignorant. But what was the use of his obtruding this ignorance of the Creator, who was a stranger to the superior god,[fn-80-P8015_2281603:817-nf] and far enough removed from him, when even his own servants had known nothing about him? To the Creator, however, the future was well known. Then why was not that also known to Him, which had to be revealed beneath His heaven, and on His earth? From this, therefore, there arises a confirmation of what we have already laid down. For since the Creator was sure to know, some time or other, that hidden mystery of the superior god, even on the supposition that the true reading was (as Marcion has it)-\"hidden from the God who created all things\"-he ought then to have expressed the conclusion thus: \"in order that the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to Him, and then to the principalities and powers of God, whosoever He might be, with whom the Creator was destined to share their knowledge.\" So palpable is the erasure in this passage, when thus read, consistently with its own true bearing. I, on my part, now wish to engage with you in a discussion on the allegorical expressions of the apostle. What figures of speech could the novel god have found in the prophets (fit for himself)? \"He led captivity captive,\" says the apostle.[fn-80-P8016_2282781:818-nf] With what arms? In what conflicts? From the devastation of what Country? From the overthrow of what city? What women, what children, what princes did the Conqueror throw into chains? For when by David Christ is sung as \"girded with His sword upon His thigh,\"[fn-80-P8017_2283078:819-nf] or by Isaiah as \"taking away the spoils of Samaria and the power of Damascus,\"[fn-80-P8018_2283176:820-nf] you make Him out to be[fn-80-P8019_2283220:821-nf] really and truly a warrior confest to the eye.[fn-80-P8020_2283284:822-nf] Learn then now, that His is a spiritual armour and warfare, since you have already discovered that the captivity is spiritual, in order that you may further learn that this also belongs to Him, even because the apostle derived the mention of the captivity from the same prophets as suggested to him his precepts likewise: \"Putting away lying,\" (says he, ) \"speak every man truth with his neighbour; \"[fn-80-P8021_2283742:823-nf] and again, using the very words in which the Psalm[fn-80-P8022_2283813:824-nf] expresses his meaning, (he says, ) \"Be ye angry, and sin not; \"[fn-80-P8023_2283895:825-nf] \"Let not the sun go down upon your wrath.\"[fn-80-P8024_2283958:826-nf] \"Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness; \"[fn-80-P8025_2284039:827-nf] for (in the Psalm it is written, ) \"With the holy man thou shalt be holy, and with the perverse thou shalt be perverse; \"[fn-80-P8026_2284180:828-nf] and, \"Thou shalt put away evil from among you.\"[fn-80-P8027_2284250:829-nf] Again, \"Go ye out from the midst of them; touch not the unclean thing; separate yourselves, ye that bear the vessels of the Lord.\"[fn-80-P8028_2284432:830-nf] (The apostle says further: ) \"Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess,\"[fn-80-P8029_2284552:831-nf] -a precept which is suggested by the passage (of the prophet), where the seducers of the consecrated (Nazarites) to drunkenness are rebuked: \"Ye gave wine to my holy ones to drink.\"[fn-80-P8030_2284753:832-nf] This prohibition from drink was given also to the high priest Aaron and his sons, \"when they went into the holy place.\"[fn-80-P8031_2284894:833-nf] The command, to \"sing to the Lord with psalms and hymns,\"[fn-80-P8032_2284970:834-nf] comes suitably from him who knew that those who \"drank wine with drums and psalteries\" were blamed by God.[fn-80-P8033_2285096:835-nf] Now, when I find to what God belong these precepts, whether in their germ or their development, I have no difficulty in knowing to whom the apostle also belongs. But he declares that \"wives ought to be in subjection to their husbands: \"[fn-80-P8034_2285357:836-nf] what reason does he give for this? \"Because,\" says he, \"the husband is the head of the wife.\"[fn-80-P8035_2285474:837-nf] Pray tell me, Marcion, does your god build up the authority of his law on the work of the Creator?

How much honour is given to the flesh in the name of the church! \"No man,\" says the apostle, \"ever yet hated his own flesh\" (except, of course, Marcion alone), \"but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord doth the Church.\"[fn-80-P8038_2286251:840-nf] But you are the only man that hates his flesh, for you rob it of its resurrection. It will be only right that you should hate the Church also, because it is loved by Christ on the same principle.[fn-80-P8039_2286466:841-nf] Yea, Christ loved the flesh even as the Church. For no man will love the picture of his wife without taking care of it, and honouring it and crowning it. The likeness partakes with the reality in the privileged honour.

He shows us that the mystery was prefigured by Him who is also the author of the mystery. Now what is Marcion's opinion? The Creator could not possibly have furnished figures to an unknown god, or, if a known one, an adversary to Himself. The superior god, in fact, ought to have borrowed nothing from the inferior; he was bound rather to annihilate Him. \"Children should obey their parents.\"[fn-80-P8046_2287944:848-nf] Now, although Marcion has erased (the next clause), \"which is the first commandment with promise,\"[fn-80-P8047_2288062:849-nf] still the law says plainly, \"Honour thy father and thy mother.\"[fn-80-P8048_2288248:850-nf] Again, (the apostle writes: ) \"Parents, bring up your children in the fear and admonition of the Lord.\"[fn-80-P8049_2288371:851-nf] For you have heard how it was said to them of old time: \"Ye shall relate these things to your children; and your children in like manner to their children.\"[fn-80-P8050_2288547:852-nf] Of what use are two gods to me, when the discipline is but one? If there must be two, I mean to follow Him who was the first to teach the lesson. But as our struggle lies against \"the rulers of this world,\"[fn-80-P8051_2288771:853-nf] what a host of Creator Gods there must be![fn-80-P8052_2288834:854-nf] For why should I not insist upon this point here, that he ought to have mentioned but one \"ruler of this world,\" if he meant only the Creator to be the being to whom belonged all the powers which he previously mentioned? Again, when in the preceding verse he bids us \"put on the whole armour of God, that we may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil,\"[fn-80-P8053_2289330:855-nf] does he not show that all the things which he mentions after the devil's name really belong to the devil-\"the principalities and the powers, and the tillers of the darkness of this world,\"[fn-80-P8054_2289539:856-nf] which we also ascribe to the devil's authority? Else, if \"the devil\" means the Creator, who will be the devil in the Creator's dispensation?[fn-80-P8055_2289700:857-nf] As there are two gods, must there also be two devils, and a plurality of powers and rulers of this world? But how is the Creator both a devil and a god at the same time, when the devil is not at once both god and devil? For either they are both of them gods, if both of them are devils; or else He who is God is not also devil, as neither is he god who is the devil. I want to know indeed by what perversion[fn-80-P8056_2290131:858-nf] the word devil is at all applicable to the Creator. Perhaps he perverted some purpose of the superior god-conduct such as He experienced Himself from the archangel, who lied indeed for the purpose. For He did not forbid (our first parents) a taste of the miserable tree,[fn-80-P8057_2290426:859-nf] from any apprehension that they would become gods; His prohibition was meant to prevent their dying after the transgression. But \"the spiritual wickedness\"[fn-80-P8058_2290609:860-nf] did not signify the Creator, because of the apostle's additional description, \"in heavenly places; \"[fn-80-P8059_2290757:861-nf] for the apostle was quite aware that \"spiritual wickedness\" had been at work in heavenly places, when angels were entrapped into sin by the daughters of men.[fn-80-P8060_2290934:862-nf] But how happened it that (the apostle) resorted to ambiguous descriptions, and I know not what obscure enigmas, for the purpose of disparaging[fn-80-P8061_2291240:863-nf] the Creator, when he displayed to the Church such constancy and plainness of speech in \"making known the mystery of the gospel for which he was an ambassador in bonds,\" owing to his liberty in preaching-and actually requested (the Ephesians) to pray to God that this \"open-mouthed utterance\" might be continued to him?[fn-80-P8062_2291718:864-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":4,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_32_book_xix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"2.

Ignorance of things, too, renders figurative expressions obscure, as when we do not know the nature of the animals, or minerals, or plants, which are frequently referred to in Scripture by way of comparison. The fact so well known about the serpent, for example, that to protect its head it will present its whole body to its assailants-how much light it throws upon the meaning of our Lord's command, that we should be wise as serpents;[fn-49-P4907_2651799:37-nf] that is to say, that for the sake of our head, which is Christ, we should willingly offer our body to the persecutors, lest the Christian faith should, as it were, be destroyed in us, if to save the body we deny our God! Or again, the statement that the serpent gets rid of its old skin by squeezing itself through a narrow hole, and thus acquires new strength-how appropriately it fits in with the direction to imitate the wisdom of the serpent, and to put off the old man, as the apostle says, that we may put on the new;[fn-49-P4908_2652341:38-nf] and to put it off, too, by coming through a narrow place, according to the saying of our Lord, \"Enter ye in at the strait gate!\"[fn-49-P4909_2652488:39-nf] As, then, knowledge of the nature of the serpent throws light upon many metaphors which Scripture is accustomed to draw from that animal, so ignorance of other animals, which are no less frequently mentioned by way of comparison, is a very great drawback to the reader. And so in regard to minerals and plants: knowledge of the carbuncle, for instance, which shines in the dark, throws light upon many of the dark places in books too, where it is used metaphorically; and ignorance of the beryl or the adamant often shuts the doors of knowledge. And the only reason why we find it easy to understand that perpetual peace is indicated by the olive branch which the dove brought with it when it returned to the ark,[fn-49-P4910_2653222:40-nf] is that we know both that the smooth touch of olive oil is not easily spoiled by a fluid of another kind, and that the tree itself is an evergreen.

For in many ways and in divers senses the Holy Scriptures make mention of the spirit; but with respect to that we are now speaking of, by which we exercise reason, intelligence, and wisdom, we are both agreed that it is called (and indeed rightly called) \"spirit,\" in such a sense as not to include the entire soul, but a part of it. If, however, you contend that the soul is not the spirit, on the ground that the understanding is distinctly called \"spirit,\" you may as well deny that the whole seed of Jacob is called Israel, since, apart from Judah, the same appellation was distinctly and separately borne by the ten tribes which were then organized in Samaria.

For he forsaketh the ways of his own vineyard, he has wandered from the paths of his own little field.

Certain people therefore interpret for themselves ill, when they say that by imposition of the hand they receive the Holy Ghost, and are thus received, when it is manifest that they ought to be born again in the Catholic Church by both sacraments. Then indeed they will be able to be sons of God, as says the apostle: \"Taking care to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body, and one Spirit, as ye have been called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God.\"[fn-94-P9429_2941140:17-nf] All these things speaks the Catholic Church.[fn-94-P9430_2941204:18-nf] And again, in the Gospel the Lord says: \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit; because God is a Spirit, and he is born of God.\"[fn-94-P9431_2941452:19-nf] Therefore, whatsoever things all heretics and schismatics do are carnal, as the apostle says: \"For the works of the flesh are manifest, which are, fornications, uncleannesses, incest, idolatries, witchcrafts, hatreds, contentions, jealousy, anger, divisions, heresies, and the like to these; concerning which have told you before, as I also foretell you now, that whoever do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-94-P9432_2941896:20-nf] And thus the apostle condemns, with all the wicked, those also who cause division, that is, schismatics and heretics.

The literal David, then, was guilty of a heinous crime, which God by the prophet condemned in the rebuke addressed to David, and which David atoned for by his repentance. On the other hand, He who is the desire of all nations loved the Church when washing herself on the roof, that is, when cleansing herself from the pollution of the world, and in spiritual contemplation mounting above her house of clay, and trampling upon it; and after commencing an acquaintance, He puts to death the devil, whom He first entirely removes from her, and joins her to Himself in perpetual union.

It does indeed make very much difference, for what cause, with what end, with what intention a thing be done: but those things which are dearly sins, are upon no plea of a good cause. with no seeming good end, no alleged good intention, to be done. Those works, namely of me, which are not in themselves sins, are now good, now evil, according as their causes are good or evil; as, to give food to a poor man is a good work, if it be done because of pity, with right faith; as to lie with a wife, when it is done for the sake of generation, if it be done with faith to beget subjects for regeneration. These and the like works according to their causes are good or evil, because the self-same, if they have evil causes, are turned into sins: as, if for boasting sake a poor man is fed; or for lasciviousness a man lies with his wife; or children are begotten, not that they may be nurtured for God, but for the devil. When, however, the works in themselves are evil, such as thefts, fornications, blasphemies, or other such; who is there that will say, that upon good causes they may be done, so as either to be no sins, or, what is more absurd, just sins? Who is there that would say, That we may have to give to the poor, let us commit thefts upon the rich: or, Let us sell false witness, especially if innocent men are not hurt thereby, but rather guilty men are rescued from the judges who would condemn them? For two good things are done by selling of this lie, that money may be taken wherewith a poor man may be fed, and a judge deceived that a man be not punished. Even in the matter of wills, if we can, why not suppress the true, and forge false wills that inheritances or legacies may not come to unworthy persons, who do no good with them; but rather to those by whom the hungry are fed, the naked clothed, strangers entertained, captives redeemed, Churches builded? For why should not those evil things be done for the sake of these good things, if, for the sake of these good things, those are not evil at all? Nay, further, if lewd and rich women are likely to enrich moreover their lovers and paramours, why should not even these parts and arts be undertaken by a man of merciful heart, to use them for so good a cause as that he may have whence to below upon the needy; and not hear the Apostle saying, \"Let him that stole steal no more, but rather let him labor, working with his hands that which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth? \"[fn-44-P4425_2152394:24-nf] If indeed not only theft itself, but also false witness and adultery and every evil work will be not evil but good, if it be done for the sake of being the means of doing good. Who can say these things, except one who endeavors to subvert human affairs and all manners and laws?

If one is to be honestly taken in hand, the other must be left alone. Just so, there are these two marriages for our choice, the one effected in the flesh, the other in the spirit; and preoccupation? the one must cause of necessity alienation from the other. No more is the eye able to look at two objects at once; but it must concentrate its special attention on one at a time; no more can the tongue effect utterances in two different languages, so as to pronounce, for instance, a Hebrew word and a Greek word in the same moment: no more can the ear take in at one and the same time a narrative of facts, and a hortatory discourse; if each special tone is heard separately, it will impress its ideas upon the hearers' minds; but if they are combined and so poured into the ear, an inextricable confusion of ideas will be the result, one meaning being mutually lost in the other: and no more, by analogy, do our emotional powers possess a nature which can at once pursue the pleasures of sense and court the spiritual union; nor, besides, can both those ends be gained by the same courses of life; continence, mortification of the passions, scorn of fleshly needs, are the agents of the oneunion; but all that are the reverse of these are the agents of bodily habitation. As, when two masters are before us to choose between, and we cannot be subject to both, for \"no man can serve two masters[fn-28-P2849_1923509:142-nf] ,\" he who is wise will choose the one most useful to himself, so, when two marriages are before us to choose between, and we cannot contract both, for \"he that is unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, but he that is married careth for the things of the world[fn-28-P2850_1923799:143-nf] ,\" I repeat that it would be the aim of a sound mind not to miss choosing the more profitable one; and not to be ignorant either of the way which will lead it to this, a way which cannot be learnt but by some such comparison as the following. In the case of a marriage of this world a man who is anxious to avoid appearing altogether insignificant pays the greatest attention both to physical health, and becoming adornment, and amplitude of means and the security from any disgraceful revelations as to his antecedents or his parentage; for so he thinks things will be most likely to turn out as he wishes. Now just in the same way the man who is courting the spiritual alliance will first of all display himself, by the renewal of his mind[fn-28-P2851_1924564:144-nf] , a young man, without a single touch of age upon him; next he will reveal a lineage rich in that in which it is a noble ambition to be rich, not priding himself on worldly wealth, but luxuriating only in the heavenly treasures. As for family distinction, he will not vaunt that which comes by the mere routine of devolution even to numbers of the worthless, but that which is gained by the successful efforts of his own zeal and labours; a distinction which only those can boast of who are \"sons of the light\" and children of God, and are styled \"nobles from the sunrise[fn-28-P2852_1925172:145-nf] \" because of their splendid deeds. Strength and health he will not try to gain by bodily training and feeding, but by all that is the contrary of this, perfecting the spirit's strength in the body's weakness. I could tell also of the suitor's gifts to the bride in such a wedding[fn-28-P2853_1925611:146-nf] ; they are not procured by the money that perishes, but are contributed out of the wealth peculiar to the soul. Would you know their names? You must hear from Paul, that excellent adorner of the Bride[fn-28-P2854_1926046:147-nf] , in what the wealth of those consists who in everything commend themselves. He mentions much else that is priceless in it, and adds, \"in chastity[fn-28-P2855_1926213:148-nf] \"; and besides this all the recognized fruits of the spirit from any quarter whatever are gifts of this marriage. If a man is going to carry out the advice of Solomon and take for helpmate and life-companion that true Wisdom of which he says, \"Love her, and she shall keep thee,\" \"honour her, that she may embrace thee[fn-28-P2856_1926553:149-nf] ,\" then he will prepare himself in a manner worthy of such a love, so as to feast with all the joyous wedding guests in spotless raiment, and not be cast forth, while claiming to sit at that feast, for not having put on the wedding garment. It is plain moreover that the argument applies equally to men and women, to move them towards such a marriage. \"There is neither male nor female[fn-28-P2857_1926959:150-nf] ,\" the Apostle says; \"Christ is all, and in all[fn-28-P2858_1927028:151-nf] \"; and so it is equally reasonable that he who is enamoured of wisdom should hold the Object of his passionate desire, Who is the True Wisdom; and that the soul which cleaves to the undying Bridegroom should have the fruition of her love for the true Wisdom, which is God.

Of this weakness of his, he saith in another place, \"We made ourselves small among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children.\"[fn-45-P4574_2252429:35-nf] For in that passage the context indicates this: \"For neither at any time,\" saith he, \"used we flattering words, as ye know, nor an occasion of covetousness; God is witness: nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others when we might have been burdensome to you as the Apostles of Christ: but we made ourselves small among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children.\" What therefore he saith to the Corinthians, that he had power of his apostleship, as also the other Apostles, which power he testifieth that he had not used; this also he saith in that place to the Thessalonians, \"When we might have been burdensome to you as Christ's Apostles:\" according to that the Lord saith, \"The workman is worthy of his hire.\" For that of this he speaks, is indicated by that which he above set down, \"Neither for occasion of coveteousness, God is witness.\" By reason, namely, of this which by right of the Lord's appointment was due to good evangelists, who not for its sake do evangelize but seek the kingdom of God, so that all these things should be added unto them, others were taking advantage thereof, of whom he also saith, \"For they that are such serve not God, but their own belly.\"[fn-45-P4575_2253676:36-nf] From whom the Apostle wished so to cut off this occasion, that even what was justly due to him, he would forego. For this himself doth openly show in the second to the Corinthians, speaking of other Churches supplying his necessities. For he had come, as it appears, to so great indigence, that from distant Churches were sent supplies for his necessities, while yet from them among whom he was, he accepted nothing of that kind. \"Have I committed a sin, \"saith he, \"in humbling myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the Gospel of God freely? Other Churches I despoiled, taking wages of them to minister unto you: and when I was present with you and wanted, to no man was I burdensome. For that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied, and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and will keep myself. It is the truth of Christ in me, that this glory shall not be infringed in me in the regions of Achaia. Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth. But what I do, I also mean to do, that I may cut off occasion from them which seek occasion, that wherein they glory they may be found as also we.\"[fn-45-P4576_2254878:37-nf] Of this occasion, therefore, which he here saith that he cuts off, he would have that understood which he saith in the former place, \"Neither for occasion of covetousness, God is witness.\" And what he here saith, \"In humbling myself that ye might be exalted:\" this in the first to the same Corinthians, \"I became to the weak as weak;\" this to the Thessalonians, \"I became small among you, as a nurse cherisheth her children.\"[fn-45-P4577_2255338:38-nf] Now then observe what follows: \"So,\" saith he, \"being affectionately desirous of you, we are minded to impart unto you not alone the Gospel of God, but our own souls also; because ye are become most dear to us. For ye remember, brethren, our labor and toil, night and day working, that we might not burden any of you.\" For this he said above, \"When we might be burdensome to you, as Christ's Apostles.\" Because, then, the weak were in peril, lest, agitated by false suspicions, they should hate an, as it were, venal Gospel, for this cause, trembling for them as with a father's and a mother's bowels of compassion, did he this thing. So too in the Acts of the Apostles he speaks the same thing, when, sending from Miletus to Ephesus, he had called thence the presbyters of the Church, to whom, among much else, \"Silver,\" saith he, \"and gold, or apparel of no man have I coveted; yourselves know, that to my necessities and theirs who were with me these hands have ministered. In all things have I shown you that so laboring it behoveth to help the weak, mindful also of the words of the Lord Jesus, for that He said, More blessed is it rather to give than to receive.\"[fn-45-P4578_2256531:39-nf] 14. Here peradventure some man may say, \"If it was bodily work that the Apostle wrought, whereby to sustain this life, what was that same work, and when did he find time for it, both to work and to preach the Gospel?\" To whom I answer: Suppose I do not know; nevertheless that he did bodily work, and thereby lived in the flesh, and did not use the power which the Lord had given to the Apostles, that preaching the Gospel he should live by the Gospel, those things above-said do without all doubt bear witness. For it is not either in one place or briefly said, that it should be possible for any most astute arguer with all his tergiversation to traduce and pervert it to another meaning. Since then so great an authority, with so mighty and so frequent blows mauling the gainsayers, doth break in pieces their contrariness, why ask they of me either what sort of work he did, or when he did it? One thing I know, that he neither did steal, nor was a housebreaker or highwayman, nor chariot-driver or hunter or player, nor given to filthy lucre: but innocently and honestly wrought things which are fitted for the uses of men; such as are the works of carpenters, builders,shoemakers, peasants, and such like. For honesty itself reprehends not what their pride cloth reprehend, who love to be called, but love not to be, honest. The Apostle then would not disdain either to take in hand any work of peasants, or to be employed in the labor of craftsmen.

If they shall say, the Jews; the Patriarchs fed cattle: if the Greeks, whom we call also Pagans; they have had philosophers, held in high honor, who were shoemakers: if the Church of God; that just man, elect to the testimony of a conjugal and ever-during virginity, to whom was betrothed the Virgin Mary who bore Christ, was a carpenter.[fn-45-P4580_2258519:41-nf] Whatever therefore of these with innocence and without fraud men do work, is good. For the Apostle himself takes precaution of this, that no man through necessity of sustaining life should turn aside to evil works. \"Let him that stole,\" saith he, \"steal no more; but rather let him labor good with his hands, that he may have to impart to him that needeth.\"[fn-45-P4581_2258898:42-nf] This then is enough to know, that also in the very work of the body the Apostle did work that which is good.","title":"Of the Work of Monks.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_37_of_the_work_of_monks_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"40. And then that further device of theirs, (if words can express it), how painfully ridiculous is it, which they have invented for defense of their long locks! \"A man,\" say they, \"the Apostle hath forbidden to have long hair: but then they who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of God are no longer men.\" O dotage unparalleled! Well may the person who says this arm himself against Holy Scripture's most manifest proclamations, with counsel of outrageous impiety, and persevere in a tortuous path, and essay to bring in a pestiferous doctrine that not \"Blessed is the man who hath notwalked in the counsel of the ungodly, and in the way of sinners hath not stood, and in thechair of noisome wickedness[fn-47-P4706_2322081:141-nf] hath not sat.[fn-47-P4707_2322117:142-nf] For if he would meditate in God's law day and night, there he should find the Apostle Paul himself, who assuredly professing highest chastity saith, \"I would that all men were even as I:\" and yet shows himself a man, not only in so being, but also in so speaking. For he saith, \"When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; when I became a man, I put away childish things.\"[fn-47-P4708_2322550:143-nf] But why should I mention the Apostle, when concerning our Lord and Saviour Himself they know not what they think who say these things. For of Whom but Him is it said, \"Until we come all to unity of faith and to knowledge of the Son of God, to the Perfect Man, to the measure of the age of the fullness of Christ; that we be no longer babes, tossed and carried about with every wind of doctrine, in sleight of men, in cunning craftiness for machination of error.\"[fn-47-P4709_2323049:144-nf] With which sleight these persons deceive ignorant people, with which cunning craftiness and machinations of the enemy both they themselves are whirled round, and in their whirling essay to make the minds of the weak which cohere unto them so (in a manner) to spin round with them, that they also may not know where they are. For they have heard or read that which is written, \"Whosoever of you have been baptized in Christ, have put on Christ: where is no Jew nor Greek; no bond nor free; no male nor female.\"[fn-47-P4710_2323583:145-nf] And they do not understand that it is in reference to concupiscence of carnal sex[fn-47-P4711_2323702:146-nf] that this is said, because in the inner man, wherein we are renewed in newness of our mind, no sex of this kind exists. Then let them not deny themselves to be men, just because in respect of their masculine sex they work not. For wedded Christians also who do this work, are of course not Christians on the score of that which they have in common with the rest who are not Christians and with the very cattle. For that is one thing that is either to infirmity conceded or to mortal propagation paid as a debt, but another that which for the laying hold of incorrupt and eternal life is by faithful profession signified. That then which concerning not veiling of the head is enjoined to men, in the body indeed it is set forth in a figure, but that it is enacted in the mind, wherein is the image and glory of God, the words themselves do indicate: \"A man indeed,\" it saith, \"ought not to veil his head, forsomuch as he is the image and glory of God.\" For where this image is, he doth himself declare, where he saith, \"Lie not one to another; but stripping off the old man with his deeds, put ye on the new, which is renewed to the acknowledging of God, according to the image of Him who created him.\"[fn-47-P4712_2324927:147-nf] Who can doubt that this renewing takes place in the mind? But and if any doubt, let him hear a more open sentence. For, giving the same admonition, he thus saith in another place: \"As is the truth in Jesus, that ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, him which is corrupt according to the lust of deception; but be ye renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new man, him which after God is created.\"[fn-47-P4713_2325382:148-nf] What then? Have women not this renewal of mind in which is the image of God? Who would say this? But in the sexof their body they do not signify this; therefore they are bidden to be veiled. The part, namely, which they signify in the very fact of their being women, is that which may be called the concupiscential part, over which the mind[fn-47-P4714_2325758:149-nf] bears rule, itself also subjected to its God, when life is most rightly and orderly conducted. What, therefore, in a single individual human being is the mind and the concupiscence, (that ruling, this ruled; that lord, this subject,) the same in two human beings, man and woman, is in regard of the sex of the body exhibited in a figure. Of which sacred import[fn-47-P4715_2326133:150-nf] the Apostle speaks when he says, that the man ought not to be veiled, the women ought. For the mind doth the more gloriously advance to higher things, the more diligently the concupiscence is curbed from lower things; until the whole man together with even this now mortal and frail body in the last resurrection be clothed with incorruption and immortality, and death be swallowed up in victory.[fn-47-P4716_2326551:151-nf] ","title":"Of the Work of Monks.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_37_book_xxiv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"1. Faustus said: We are asked the reason But we do not assert that man is in no sense for our denial that man is made by God. made by God; we only ask in what sense, and when, and how. For, according to the apostle, there are two men, one of whom he calls sometimes the outer man, generally the earthy, sometimes, too, the old man: the other he calls the inner or heavenly or new man.[fn-23-P2341_1416225:1-nf] The question is, Which of these is made by God? For there are likewise two times of our nativity; one when nature brought us forth into this light, binding us in the bonds of flesh; and the other, when the truth regenerated us on our conversion from error and our entrance into the faith. It is this second birth of which Jesus speaks in the Gospel, when He says, \"Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\"[fn-23-P2342_1416726:2-nf] Nicodemus, not knowing what Christ meant, was at a loss, and inquired how this could be, for an old man could not enter into his mother's womb and be born a second time. Jesus said in reply, \"Except a man be born of water and of the Holy Spirit, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\" Then He adds, \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.\" Hence, as the birth in which our bodies originate is not the only birth, but there is another in which we are born again in spirit, an important question arises from this distinction as to which of those births it is in which God makes us. The manner of birth also is twofold. In the humiliating process of ordinary generation, we spring from the heat of animal passion; but when we are brought into the faith, we are formed under good instruction in honor and purity in Jesus Christ, by the Holy Spirit. For this reason, in all religion, and especially in the Christian religion, young children are invited to membership. This is hinted at in the words of His apostle: \"My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you.\"[fn-23-P2343_1417885:3-nf] The question, then, is not whether God makes man, but what man He makes, and when, and how. For if it is when we are fashioned in the womb that God forms us after His own image, which is the common belief of Gentiles and Jews, and which is also your belief, then God makes the old man, and produces us by means of sensual passion, which does not seem suitable to His divine nature. But if it is when we are converted and brought to a better life that we are formed by God, which is the general doctrine of Christ and His apostles, and which is also our doctrine, in this case God makes us new men, and produces us in honor and purity, which would agree perfectly with His sacred and adorable majesty. If you do not reject Paul's authority, we will prove to you from him what man God makes, and when, and how. He says to the Ephesians, \"That ye put off according to your former conversation the old man, which is corrupt through deceitful lusts; and be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and holiness of truth.\"[fn-23-P2344_1418981:4-nf] This shows that in the creation of man after the image of God, it is another man that is spoken of, and another birth, and another manner of birth. The putting off and putting on of which he speaks, point to the time of the reception of the truth; and the assertion that the new man is created by God implies that the old man is created neither by God nor after God. And when he adds, that this new man is made in holiness and righteousness and truth, he thus points to another manner of birth of which this is the character, and which, as I have said, differs widely from the manner in which bodily generation is effected. And as he declares that only the former is of God, it follows that the latter is not. Again, writing to the Colossians, he uses words to the same effect: \"Put off the old man with his deeds, and put on the new man, which is renewed in the knowledge of God according to the image of Him who created Him in you.\" Here he not only shows that it is the new man that God makes, but he declares the time and manner of the formation, for the words in the knowledge of God point to the time of believing. Then he adds, according to the image of Him who created him, to make it clear that the old man is not the image of God, nor formed by God. Moreover, the following words, \"Where there is neither male nor female, Jew nor Greek, Barbarian nor Scythian,\"[fn-23-P2345_1420372:5-nf] show more plainly still that the birth by which we are made male and female, Greeks and Jews, Scythians and Barbarians, is not the birth in which God effects the formation of man; but that the birth with which God has to do is that in which we lose the difference of nation and sex and condition, and become one like Him who is one, that is, Christ. So the same apostle says again, \"As many as have been baptized in Christ have put on Christ: there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither male nor female, there is neither bond nor free; but all are one in Christ.\"[fn-23-P2346_1420960:6-nf] Man, then, is made by God, not when from one he is divided into many, but when from many he becomes one. The division is in the first birth, or that of the body; union comes by the second, which is immaterial and divine. This affords sufficient ground for our opinion, that the birth of the body should be ascribed to nature, and the second birth to the Supernal Majesty. So the same apostle says again to the Corinthians, \"I have begotten you in Christ Jesus by the gospel;\"[fn-23-P2347_1421459:7-nf] and, speaking of himself, to the Galatians, \"When it pleased Him, who separated me from my mother's womb, to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood.\"[fn-23-P2348_1421703:8-nf] It is plain that everywhere he speaks of the second or spiritual birth as that in which we are made by God, as distinct from the indecency of the first birth, in which we are on a level with other animals as regards dignity and purity, as we are conceived in the maternal womb, and are formed, and brought forth. You may observe that in this matter the dispute between us is not so much about a question of doctrine as of interpretation. For you think that it is the old or outer or earthy man that is said to have been made by God; while we apply this to the heavenly man, giving the superiority to the inner or new man. And our opinion is not rash or groundless, for we have learned it from Christ and His apostles, who are proved to have been the first in the world who thus taught.","title":"Book XXIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":22,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":47,"source_paragraph":"157","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But in their blindness they again impale themselves on the point of the old and the new man.

And from that time, ever since the blessing which was pronounced upon man's generation,[fn-101-P10113_2819074:299-nf] the flesh and the soul have had a simultaneous birth, without any calculable difference in time; so that the two have been even generated together in the womb, as we have shown in our Treatise on the Soul.[fn-101-P10114_2819299:300-nf] Contemporaneous in the womb, they are also temporally identical in their birth. The two are no doubt produced by human parents[fn-101-P10115_2819448:301-nf] of two substances, but not at two different periods; rather they are so entirely one, that neither is before the other in point of time. It is more correct (to say), that we are either entirely the old man or entirely the new, for we cannot tell how we can possibly be anything else. But the apostle mentions a very clear mark of the old man. For \"put off,\" says he, \"concerning the former conversation, the old man; \"[fn-101-P10116_2819924:302-nf] (he does) not say concerning the seniority of either substance. It is not indeed the flesh which he bids us to put off, but the works which he in another passage shows to be \"works of the flesh.\"[fn-101-P10117_2820140:303-nf] He brings no accusation against men's bodies, of which he even writes as follows: \"Putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbor: for we are members one of another. Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: neither give place to the devil. Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands (the thing which is good), that he may have to give to him that needeth. Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good for the edification of faith, that it may minister grace unto the hearers. And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil-speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: but be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ hath forgiven you.\"[fn-101-P10118_2821063:304-nf] Why, therefore, do not those who suppose the flesh to be the old man, hasten their own death, in order that by laying aside the old man they may satisfy the apostle's precepts? As for ourselves, we believe that the whole of faith is to be administered in the flesh, nay more, by the flesh, which has both a mouth for the utterance of all holy words, and a tongue to refrain from blasphemy, and a heart to avoid all irritation, and hands to labour and to give; while we also maintain that as well the old man as the new has relation to the difference of moral conduct, and not to any discrepancy of nature. And just as we acknowledge that that which according to its former conversation was \"the old man\" was also corrupt, and received its very name in accordance with \"its deceitful lusts,\" so also (do we hold) that it is \"the old man in reference to its former conversation,\"[fn-101-P10119_2821964:305-nf] and not in respect of the flesh through any permanent dissolution. Moreover, it is still unimpaired in the flesh, and identical in that nature, even when it has become \"the new man; \"since it is of its sinful course of life, and not of its corporeal substance, that it has been divested.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":4,"verse":22,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":51,"source_paragraph":"165","folder":"ANF-03","text":"We come now to the very gist[fn-101-P10181_2839825:355-nf] of the whole question: What are the substances, and of what nature are they, which the apostle has disinherited of the kingdom of God? The preceding statements give us a clue to this point also. He says: \"The first man is of the earth, earthy\"-that is, made of dust, that is, Adam; \"the second man is from heaven\"[fn-101-P10182_2840177:356-nf] -that is, the Word of God, which is Christ, in no other way, however, man (although \"from heaven \"), than as being Himself flesh and soul, just as a human being is, just as Adam was. Indeed, in a previous passage He is called \"the second Adam, \"[fn-101-P10183_2840445:357-nf] deriving the identity of His name from His participation in the substance, because not even Adam was flesh of human seed, in which Christ is also like Him.[fn-101-P10184_2840617:358-nf] \"As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.\"[fn-101-P10185_2840773:359-nf] Such (does he mean), in substance; or first of all in training, and afterwards in the dignity and worth which that training aimed at acquiring? Not in substance, however, by any means will the earthy and the heavenly be separated, designated as they have been by the apostle once for all, as men. For even if Christ were the only true \"heavenly,\" nay, super-celestial Being, He is still man, as composed of body and soul; and in no respect is He separated from the quality of \"earthiness,\" owing to that condition of His which makes Him a partaker of both substances. In like manner, those also who after Him are heavenly, are understood to have this celestial quality predicated of them not from their present nature, but from their future glory; because in a preceding sentence, which originated this distinction respecting difference of dignity, there was shown to be \"one glory in celestial bodies, and another in terrestrial ones,\"[fn-101-P10186_2841732:360-nf] -\"one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for even one star differeth from another star in glory, \"[fn-101-P10187_2841899:361-nf] although not in substance. Then, after having thus premised the difference in that worth or dignity which is even now to be aimed at, and then at last to be enjoyed, the apostle adds an exhortation, that we should both here in our training follow the example of Christ, and there attain His eminence in glory: \"As we have borne the image of the earthy, let us also bear the image of the heavenly.\"[fn-101-P10188_2842313:362-nf] We have indeed borne the image of the earthy, by our sharing in his transgression, by our participation in his death, by our banishment from Paradise. Now, although the image of Adam is here borne by is in the flesh, yet we are not exhorted to put off the flesh; but if not the flesh, it is the conversation, in order that we may then bear the image of the heavenly in ourselves,-no longer indeed the image of God, and no longer the image of a Being whose state is in heaven; but after the lineaments of Christ, by our walking here in holiness, righteousness, and truth. And so wholly intent on the inculcation of moral conduct is he throughout. this passage, that he tells us we ought to bear the image of Christ in this flesh of ours, and in this period of instruction and discipline. For when he says \"let us bear\" in the imperative mood, he suits his words to the present life, in which man exists in no other substance than as flesh and soul; or if it is another, even the heavenly, substance to which this faith (of ours) looks forward, yet the promise is made to that substance to which the injunction is given to labour earnestly to merit its reward. Since, therefore, he makes the image both of the earthy and the heavenly consist of moral conduct-the one to be abjured, and the other to be pursued-and then consistently adds, \"For this I say\" (on account, that is, of what I have already said, because the conjunction \"for\" connects what follows with the preceding words) \"that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God,\"[fn-101-P10189_2843870:363-nf] -he means the flesh and blood to be understood in no other sense than the before-mentioned \"image of the earthy; \"and since this is reckoned to consist in \"the old conversation,\"[fn-101-P10190_2844071:364-nf] which old conversation receives not the kingdom of God, therefore flesh and blood, by not receiving the kingdom of God, are reduced to the life of the old conversation. Of course, as the apostle has never put the substance for the works of man, he cannot use such a construction here. Since, however he has declared of men which are yet alive in the flesh, that they \"are not in the flesh,\"[fn-101-P10191_2844486:365-nf] meaning that they are not living in the works of the flesh, you ought not to subvert its form nor its substance, but only the works done in the substance (of the flesh), alienating us from the kingdom of God. It is after displaying to the Galatians these pernicious works that he professes to warn them beforehand, even as he had \"told them in time past, that they which do such things should not inherit the kingdom of God,\"[fn-101-P10192_2844933:366-nf] even because they bore not the image of the heavenly, as they had borne the image of the earthy; and so, in consequence of their old conversation, they were to be regarded as nothing else than flesh and blood. But even if the apostle had abruptly thrown out the sentence that flesh and blood must be excluded from the kingdom of God, without any previous intimation, of his meaning, would it not have been equally our duty to interpret these two substances as the old man abandoned to mere flesh and blood-in other words, to eating and drinking, one feature of which would be to speak against the faith of the resurrection: \"Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.\"[fn-101-P10193_2845622:367-nf] Now, when the apostle parenthetically inserted this, he censured flesh and blood because of their enjoyment in eating and drinking.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":4,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_33_oration_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"3.

For, expounding Isaiah the Prophet in reference to what is written, \"I have begotten and brought up children, and they have despised me,\"[fn-57-P5785_2272533:126-nf] he undertook to dispute concerning the generations which are of God, and in that argument he quoted the testimony of John when he says, \"He that is bornof God sinneth not.\"[fn-57-P5786_2272724:127-nf] And, treating the samevery difficult question, he says: \"Since in this world there is none who is free from sin; since John himself says, `If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar.'[fn-57-P5787_2272941:128-nf] But if `they that are born of God sin not,' and if these words refer to those of them who are in the world, it is necessary that we should regard them as those numberless people who have obtained God's grace by the regeneration of the laver. But yet, when the prophet says, `All things are waiting upon Thee, that Thou mayest give them meat in season. That Thou givest them they gather for themselves; when Thou openest Thine hand, all things shall be filled with goodness. But when Thou turnest away Thy face, they shall be troubled: Thou shall take away their breath, and they shall fail, and shall be turned into their dust. Thou shall send forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be created: and Thou shalt renew the face of the earth,'[fn-57-P5788_2273696:129-nf] such things as these cannot seem to have been said of any time whatever but of that future time, in which there shall be a new earth and a new heaven. Therefore they shall be disturbed that they may take their beginning. `And when Thou openest Thy hand all things shall be filled with goodness,' which is not easily characteristic of this age. For concerning this age what does Scripture say? `There is none that doeth good, no, not one.'[fn-57-P5789_2274160:130-nf] If, therefore, there are different generations,-and here the very entrance into this life is the receiver of sins to such an extent that even he who begot should be despised; while another generation does not receive sins;-let us consider whether by any means there may not be a regeneration for us after the course of this life,-of which regeneration it is said, `In the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of His glory.'[fn-57-P5790_2274623:131-nf] For as that is called the regeneration of washing whereby we are renewed from the filth of sins washed away, so that seems to be called a regeneration by which we are purified from every stain of bodily materiality, and are regenerated in the pure sense of the soul to life eternal; so that every quality of regeneration may be purer than ofthat washing, so that no suspicion of sins can fall either on a man's doings, or even on his very thoughts themselves.\" Moreover, in another place in the same work he says: \"We see it to be impossible that any person created in a body can be absolutely spotless, since even Paul says I that he is imperfect. For thus he has it: `Not that I have already received, or am already perfect;'[fn-57-P5791_2275373:132-nf] and yet after a little he says, 'As many of us, therefore, as are perfect.'[fn-57-P5792_2275471:133-nf] Unless, perchance, there is one perfection in this world, another after this is completed, of which he says to the Corinthians, `When that which is perfect is come;'[fn-57-P5793_2275659:134-nf] and elsewhere, `Till we all come into the unity of the faith, and the knowledge of the Son of God, into the perfect man to the measure of the age of the fulness of Christ.'[fn-57-P5794_2275857:135-nf] As, then, the apostle says that many are placed in this world who are perfect along with him, but who, if you have regard to true perfection, could not be perfect, since he says, `We see now through a mirror, enigmatically; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then I shall know even as also I am known:'[fn-57-P5795_2276192:136-nf] so also there both are those who are 'spotless' in this world, and will be those who are 'spotless' in the kingdom of God, although certainly, if you consider it accurately, no person can be spotless, because no person is without sin.\" Also in the same he says: \"We see that, while we live in this life, we ought to purify ourselves and to seek God; and to begin from the purification of our soul, and as it were to establish the foundations of virtue, so that we may deserve to attain the perfection of our purgation after this life.\" And again, in the same he says: \"But laden and groaning, who does not say, `O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?'[fn-57-P5796_2276905:137-nf] So with the same teacher we give all varieties of interpretation. For if he is unhappy who recognises himself as involved in the evils of the body, certainly everybody is unhappy; for I should not call that man happy who, being confused with any darkness of his mind, does not know his own condition. That, moreover, has not absurdly come to be understood; for if a man who knows himself is unhappy, assuredly all are wretched, because every one either recognises his weakness by wisdom, or by folly is ignorant of it.\" Moreover, in the treatise \"On the Benefit of Death,\" he says:[fn-57-P5797_2277508:138-nf] \"Let death work in us, in order that that may work life also, a good life after death,-that is, a good life after victory, a good life after the contest is finished; so that now no longer the law of the flesh may know how to resist the law of the mind, that no longer we may have any contention with the body of death.\" Again, in the same treatise he says: \"Therefore, because the righteous have this reward, that they see the face of God, and that light which lightens every man, let us henceforth put on the desire of this kind of reward, that our soul may draw near to God, our prayer may draw near to Him, our desire may cleave, to Him, that we be not separated from Him. And placed here as we are, let us by meditating, by reading, by seeking, be united with God. Let us know Him as we can. For we know Him in part here; because here all things are imperfect, there all are perfect; here we are infants, there we shall be strong men. `We see,' says he, `now through a mirror in an enigma, but then face to face.' Then, His face being revealed, we shall be allowed to look upon the glory of God, which now our souls, involved in the compacted dregs of this body, and shadowed by some stains and filth of this flesh, cannot clearly see. `For who,' He says, `shall see my face and live?' and rightly. For if our eyes cannot bear the rays of the sun,-and if any one should gaze too long on the region of the sun he is said to be blinded,-if a creature cannot look upon a creature without deceit and offence, how can he without his own peril look upon the glittering face of the eternal Creator, covered as he is with the clothing of this body?

But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil.\"[fn-91-P9176_2982170:26-nf] Wherefore set your hearts continually in the strength (virtute) of God, and always resist the wicked, and tell these things, according to the word of the prophet, \"to the generations following; for this God is our God unto eternity, and He will rule us for ever and ever.\"[fn-91-P9177_2982467:27-nf] Hence ye who are set for examples (in specula) by the Lord, ought by all means to check and keep back those who devise crafty counsels against the brethren, or excite against them seditions and slanders. For it is an easy thing to deceive man with a word, but it is not so with the Lord. Wherefore ye ought to reprehend such persons, and turn away from them, to the end that, all darkness of this manner being completely done away, the Morning Star may shine upon them, and gladness arise in their hearts. \"And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, brethren, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.\"[fn-91-P9178_2983120:28-nf] For the more ye show forth your kindnesses to them, the greater a return have ye to look for from the omnipotent God whom they serve.

You have Him exclaiming in the midst of His passion: \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me? \"[fn-108-P10887_3058403:420-nf] Either, then, the Son suffered, being \"forsaken\" by the Father, and the Father consequently suffered nothing, inasmuch as He forsook the Son; or else, if it was the Father who suffered, then to what God was it that He addressed His cry? But this was the voice of flesh and soul, that is to say, of man-not of the Word and Spirit, that is to say, not of God; and it was uttered so as to prove the impassibility of God, who \"forsook\" His Son, so far as He handed over His human substance to the suffering of death. This verity the apostle also perceived, when he writes to this effect: \"If the Father spa. red not His own Son.\"[fn-108-P10888_3059054:421-nf] This did Isaiah before him likewise perceive, when he declared: \"And the Lord hath delivered Him up for our offences.\"[fn-108-P10889_3059195:422-nf] In this manner He \"forsook\" Him, in not sparing Him; \"forsook\" Him, in delivering Him up.

If, indeed, they so understand our merits as to acknowledge them, too, to be the gifts of God, then their opinion would not deserve reprobation.

Seeing, then, that such is the end, when all enemies will be subdued to Christ, when death-the last enemy-shall be destroyed, and when the kingdom shall be delivered up by Christ (to whom all things are subject) to God the Father; let us, I say, from such an end as this, contemplate the beginnings of things. For the end is always like the beginning: and, therefore, as there is one end to all things, so ought we to understand that there was one beginning; and as there is one end to many things, so there spring from one beginning many differences and varieties, which again, through the goodness of God, and by subjection to Christ, and through the unity of the Holy Spirit, are recalled to one end, which is like unto the beginning: all those, viz., who, bending the knee at the name of Jesus, make known by so doing their subjection to Him: and these are they who are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth: by which three classes the whole universe of things is pointed out, those, viz., who from that one beginning were arranged, each according to the diversity of his conduct, among the different orders, in accordance with their desert; for there was no goodness in them by essential being, as in God and His Christ, and in the Holy Spirit. For in the Trinity alone, which is the author of all things, does goodness exist in virtue of essential being; while others possess it as an accidental and perishable quality, and only then enjoy blessedness, when they participate in holiness and wisdom, and in divinity itself. But if they neglect and despise such participation, then is each one, by fault of his own slothfulness, made, one more rapidly, another more slowly, one in a greater, another in a less degree, the cause of his own downfall. And since, as we have remarked, the lapse by which an individual falls away from his position is characterized by great diversity, according to the movements of the mind and will, one man falling with greater ease, another with more difficulty, into a lower condition; in this is to be seen the just judgment of the providence of God, that it should happen to every one according to the diversity of his conduct, in proportion to the desert of his declension and defection. Certain of those, indeed, who remained in that beginning which we have described as resembling the end which is to come, obtained, in the ordering and arrangement of the world, the rank of angels; others that of influences, others of principalities, others of powers, that they may exercise power over those who need to have power upon their head. Others, again, received the rank of thrones, having the office of judging or ruling those who require this; others dominion, doubtless, over slaves; all of which are conferred by Divine Providence in just and impartial judgment according to their merits, and to the progress which they had made in the participation and imitation of God. But those who have been removed from their primal state of blessedness have not been removed irrecoverably, but have been placed under the rule of those holy and blessed orders which we have described; and by availing themselves of the aid of these, and being remoulded by salutary principles and discipline, they may recover themselves, and be restored to their condition of happiness. From all which I am of opinion, so far as I can see, that this order of the human race has been appointed in order that in the future world, or in ages to come, when there shall be the new heavens and new earth, spoken of by Isaiah, it may be restored to that unity promised by the Lord Jesus in His prayer to God the Father on behalf of His disciples: \"I do not pray for these alone, but for all who shall believe on Me through their word: that they all. may be one, as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be one in Us; \"[fn-64-P6406_1206122:108-nf] and again, when He says: \"That they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and Thou in Me, that they may be made perfect in one.\"[fn-64-P6407_1206282:109-nf] And this is further confirmed by the language of the Apostle Paul: \"Until we all come in the unity of the faith to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.\"[fn-64-P6408_1206495:110-nf] And in keeping with this is the declaration of the same apostle, when he exhorts us, who even in the present life are placed in the Church, in which is the form of that kingdom which is to come, to this same similitude of unity: \"That ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.\"[fn-64-P6409_1206906:111-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":4,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_18_deposition_of_arius","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"1.

But this whole process of up-building, by which the body of the church is increased in all its members, will be completed by mutual love. We can understand the whole mass of rational creatures by the example of a single rational animal; and whatever we say of the single creature, we may be sure will be applicable to every creature. Let us imagine this creature, then, to have had all its limbs, veins and flesh so torn apart that neither bone should cleave to bone nor muscle be joined to muscle, that the eyes lie in one place apart, the nose in another, that the hands are placed here and the feet thrown out there, and the rest of the members are in a similar way dispersed and divided. Then let us suppose that a physician arrives on the spot, of such skill as to be able to imitate the acts of Aesculapius, as told in the stories of the heathen, and to raise up a new form, the new man Virbius.[fn-87-P8798_2257931:103-nf] It will be necessary for him to restore each member to its own place, to couple joint to joint, and to replace the various parts and glue them together, so as to make the body one again. So far this single comparison has carried us. But now let us take another typical case, so as, by a similar illustration to make clear that which we wish to have understood. A child is growing up; moment by moment, though the process is hidden from us, he is tending to perfect maturity. His hands enlarge, his feet undergo a proportional increase; the belly, though we cannot see it, is filled, the shoulders widen unmarked by the eyes, and all the members in each part grow according to their measure, but in such a way that they evidently increase not for themselves but for the body. So will it be in the time of the restitution of all things, when the true physician Jesus Christ, shall come to restore to health the whole body of the church which is now dispersed and torn. Every one, according to the measure of his faith and his recognition of the Son of God (it is called recognition because he first knew him and afterwards ceased from knowing him), will receive his proper place, and will begin to be what he once had been: not that, according to another opinion which is a heresy,[fn-87-P8799_2259277:104-nf] all will be placed in one condition,[fn-88-P8800_2259401:105-nf] that is, all restored to the condition of Angels, but that every member will be perfected according to its measure and office: for instance, that the apostate angel will begin to be that which he was originally made, and man who had been cast out of the garden of Eden will be brought back to cultivate the garden again. But all these things will be so constituted that they will be joined to one another by mutual love, each member rejoicing with its fellow and being gladdened by its advancement; and so the church of the first born, the body of Christ, will dwell in the heavenly Jerusalem which the Apostle in another place calls the mother of the Saints.\"","title":"Book I.","author":"Rufinus"},{"chapter":4,"verse":27,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_47_book_iii_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"65","folder":"ANF-04","text":"4. With respect to the thoughts which proceed from our heart, or the recollection of things which we have done, or the contemplation of any things or causes whatever, we find that they sometimes proceed from ourselves, and sometimes are originated by the opposing powers; not seldom also are they suggested by God, or by the holy angels. Now such a statement will perhaps appear incredible,[fn-71-P7137_1571976:286-nf] unless it be confirmed by the testimony of holy Scripture, That, then, thoughts arise within ourselves, David testifies in the Psalms, saying, \"The thought of a man will make confession to Thee, and the rest of the thought shall observe to Thee a festival day.\"[fn-71-P7138_1572256:287-nf] That this, however, is also brought about by the opposing powers, is shown by Solomon in the book of Ecclesiastes in the following manner: \"If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for soundness restrains great offences.\"[fn-71-P7139_1572638:288-nf] The Apostle Paul also will bear testimony to the same point in the words: \"Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of Christ.\"[fn-71-P7140_1572857:289-nf] That it is an effect due to God, nevertheless, is declared by David, when he says in the Psalms, \"Blessed is the man whose help is in Thee, O Lord, Thy ascents (are) in his heart.\"[fn-71-P7141_1573058:290-nf] And the apostle says that \"God put it into the heart of Titus.\"[fn-71-P7142_1573480:291-nf] That certain thoughts are suggested to men's hearts either by good or evil angels, is shown both by the angel that accompanied Tobias,[fn-71-P7143_1573639:292-nf] and by the language of the prophet, where he says, \"And the angel who spoke in me answered.\"[fn-71-P7144_1573777:293-nf] The book of the Shepherd[fn-71-P7145_1573933:294-nf] declares the same, saying that each individual is attended by two angels; that whenever good thoughts arise in our hearts, they are suggested by the good angel; but when of a contrary kind, they are the instigation of the evil angel. The same is declared by Barnabas in his Epistle,[fn-71-P7146_1574279:295-nf] where he says there are two ways, one of light and one of darkness, over which he asserts that certain angels are placed;-the angels of God over the way of light, the angels of Satan over the way of darkness. We are not, however, to imagine that any other result follows from what is suggested to our heart, whether good or bad, save a (mental) commotion only, and an incitement instigating us either to good or evil. For it is quite within our reach, when a malignant power has begun to incite us to evil, to cast away from us the wicked suggestions, and to resist the vile inducements, and to do nothing that is at all deserving of blame. And, on the other hand, it is possible, when a divine power calls us to better things, not to obey the call; our freedom of will being preserved to us in either case. We said, indeed, in the foregoing pages, that certain recollections of good or evil actions were suggested to us either by the act of divine providence or by the opposing powers, as is shown in the book of Esther, when Artaxerxes had not remembered the services of that just man Mordecai, but, when wearied out with his nightly vigils, had it put into his mind by God to require that the annals of his great deeds should be read to him; whereon, being reminded of the benefits received from Mordecai, he ordered his enemy Haman to be hanged, but splendid honours to be conferred on him, and impunity from the threatened danger to be granted to the whole of the holy nation. On the other hand, however, we must suppose that it was through the hostile influence of the devil that the suggestion was introduced into the minds of the high priests and the scribes which they made to Pilate, when they came and said, \"Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.\"[fn-71-P7147_1576156:296-nf] The design of Judas, also, respecting the betrayal of our Lord and Saviour, did not originate in the wickedness of his mind alone. For Scripture testifies that the \"devil had already put it into his heart to betray Him.\"[fn-71-P7148_1576401:297-nf] And therefore Solomon rightly commanded, saying, \"Keep thy heart with all diligence.\"[fn-71-P7149_1576508:298-nf] And the Apostle Paul warns us: \"Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest perhaps we should let them slip.\"[fn-71-P7150_1576684:299-nf] And when he says, \"Neither give place to the devil,\"[fn-71-P7151_1576756:300-nf] he shows by that injunction that it is through certain acts, or a kind of mental slothfulness, that room is made for the devil, so that, if he once enter our heart, he will either gain possession of us, or at least will pollute the soul, if he has not obtained the entire mastery over it, by casting on us his fiery darts; and by these we are sometimes deeply wounded, and sometimes only set on fire. Seldom indeed, and only in a few instances, are these fiery darts quenched, so as not to find a place where they may wound, i.e., when one is covered by the strong and mighty shield of faith. The declaration, indeed, in the Epistle to the Ephesians, \"We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places,\"[fn-71-P7152_1577608:301-nf] must be so understood as if \"we\" meant, \"I Paul, and you Ephesians, and all who have not to wrestle against flesh and blood: \"for such have to struggle against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, not like the Corinthians, whose struggle was as yet against flesh and blood, and who had been overtaken by no temptation but such as is common to man.","title":"Book III.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":4,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_46_book_x_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"32","folder":"ANF-10","text":"But as we said above in reference to the words, \"Then shall the righteous shine as the sun,\" that the righteous will shine not differently as formerly, but as one sun, we will, of necessity, set forth what appears to us on the point.

Some one may inquire how some speak about the difference of light among the righteous, while the Saviour on the contrary says, \"They shall shine as one sun.\" I think, then, that at the beginning of the blessedness enjoyed by those who are being saved (because those who are not such are not yet purified), the difference connected with the light of the saved takes place: but when, as we have indicated, he gathers from the whole kingdom of Christ all things that make men stumble, and the reasonings that work iniquity are cast into the furnace of fire, and the worse elements utterly consumed, and, when this takes place, those who received the words which are the children of the evil one come to self-consciousness, then shall the righteous having become one light of the sun shine in the kingdom of their Father. For whom will they shine? For those below them who will enjoy their light, after the analogy of the sun which now shines for those upon the earth? For, of course, they will not shine for themselves.

For one is adorned with flowers of knowledge, another is more strongly fortified with methods of discretion, another is established in the dignity of patience, another excels inthe virtue of humility, another in that of continence, another is decked with the grace of simplicity. This one excels all others in magnanimity, that one in pity, another in vigils, another in silence, another in earnestness of work. And therefore the monk who desires to gather spiritual honey, ought like a most careful bee, to suck out virtue from those who specially possess it, and should diligently store it up in the vessel of his own breast: nor should he investigate what any one is lacking in, but only regard and gather whatever virtue he has. For if we want to gain all virtues from some one person, we shall with great difficulty or perhaps never at all find suitable examples for us to imitate. For though we do not as yet see that even Christ is made \"all things in all,\" as the Apostle says;[fn-24-P2464_1032861:6-nf] still in this way we can find Him bit by bit in all. For it is said of Him, \"Who was made of God to you wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.\"[fn-24-P2465_1033044:7-nf] While then in one there is found wisdom, in another righteousness, in another sanctification, in another kindness, in another chastity, in another humility, in another patience, Christ is at the present time divided, member by member, among all of the saints. But when all come together into the unity of the faith and virtue, He is formed into the \"perfect man,\"[fn-24-P2466_1033425:8-nf] completing the fulness of His body, in the joints and properties of all His members. Until then that time arrives when God will be \"all in all,\" for the present God can in the way of which we have spoken be \"in all,\" through particular virtues, although He is not yet \"all in all\" through the fulness of them. For although our religion has but one end and aim, yet there are different ways by which we approach God, as will be more fully shown in the Conferences of the Elders.[fn-24-P2467_1033919:9-nf] And so we must seek a model of discretion and continence more particularly from those from whom we see that those virtues flow forth more abundantly through the grace of the Holy Spirit; not that any one can alone acquire those things which are divided among many, but in order that in those good qualities of which we are capable we may advance towards the imitation of those who especially have acquired them.","title":"Book V.Of the Spirit of Gluttony.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":4,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_14_npnf1_14_15_homily_xi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"[2.] Wherefore then does he use the expression, \"was made\"?

Our friends take it amiss that I have spoken of the Origenists as confederated together by orgies of false oaths. I named the book in which I had found it written, that is, the sixth book of Origen's Miscellanies, in which he tries to adapt our Christian doctrine to the opinions of Plato. The words of Plato in the third book of the Republic[fn-91-P9123_2432745:35-nf] are as follows: \"Truth, said Socrates, is to be specially cultivated. If, however, as I was saying just now, falsehood is disgraceful and useless to God, to men it is sometimes useful, if only it is used as a stimulant[fn-91-P9124_2432977:36-nf] or a medicine; for no one can doubt that some such latitude of statement must be allowed to physicians, though it must be taken out of the hands of those who are unskilled. That is quite true, it was replied; and if one admits that any person may do this, it must be the duty of the rulers of states at times to tell lies, either to baffle the enemy or to benefit their country and the citizens. On the other hand to those who do not know how to make a good rise of falsehood, the practice should be altogether prohibited.\" Now take the words of Origen: \"When we consider the precept[fn-91-P9125_2433593:37-nf] `Speak truth every man with his neighbour,' we need not ask, Who is my neighbour? but we should weigh well the cautious remarks of the philosopher. He says, that to God falsehood is shameful and useless, but to men it is occasionally useful. We must not suppose that God ever lies, even in the way of economy;[fn-91-P9126_2433921:38-nf] only, if the good of the hearer requires it, he speaks in ambiguous language, and reveals what he wills in enigmas, taking care at once that the dignity of truth should be preserved and yet that what would be hurtful if produced nakedly before the crowd should be enveloped in a veil and thus disclosed. But a man on whom necessity imposes the responsibility of lying is bound to use very great care, and to use falsehood as he would a stimulant or a medicine, and strictly to preserve its measure, and not go beyond the bounds observed by Judith in her dealings with Holofernes, whom she overcame by the wisdom with which she dissembled her words. He should act like Esther who changed the purpose of Artaxerxes by having so long concealed the truth as to her race; and still more the patriarch Jacob who, as we read, obtained the blessing of his father by artifice and falsehood. From all this it is evident that if we speak falsely with any other object than that of obtaining by it some great good, we shall be judged as the enemies of him who said, I am the truth.\" This Origen wrote, and none of us can deny it. And he wrote it in the book which he addressed to the `perfect,' his own disciples. His teaching is that the master may lie, but the disciple must not. The inference from this is that the man who is a good liar, and without hesitation sets before his brethren any fabrication which rises into his mouth, shows himself to be an excellent teacher.","title":"Jerome's Apology for Himself Against the Books of Rufinus.","author":"Rufinus"},{"chapter":4,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_42_jerome_s_apology_for_himself_against_the_books_of_rufinus_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"92","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"26.

Not as a teacher speaking to his pupils, not as a master to his domestics, nor as God to men, but as a father, does the Lord gently admonish his children. Thus Moses confesses that \"he was filled with quaking and terror\"[fn-31-P3150_913902:103-nf] while he listened to God speaking concerning the Word. And art not thou afraid as thou hearest the voice of the Divine Word? Art not thou distressed? Do you not fear, and hasten to learn of Him,-that is, to salvation,-dreading wrath, loving grace, eagerly striving after the hope set before us, that you may shun the judgment threatened? Come, come, O my young people! For if you become not again as little children, and be born again, as saith the Scripture, you shall not receive the truly existent Father, nor shall you ever enter into the kingdom of heaven. For in what way is a stranger permitted to enter? Well, as I take it, then, when he is enrolled and made a citizen, and receives one to stand to him in the relation of father, then will he be occupied with the Father's concerns, then shall he be deemed worthy to be made His heir, then will he share the kingdom of the Father with His own dear Son. For this is the first-born Church, composed of many good children; these are \"the first-born enrolled in heaven, who hold high festival with so many myriads of angels.\" We, too, are first-born sons, who are reared by God, who are the genuine friends of the First-born, who first of all other men attained to the knowledge of God, who first were wrenched away from our sins, first severed from the devil.

And the Lord, with ceaseless assiduity, exhorts, terrifies, urges, rouses, admonishes; He awakes from the sleep of darkness, and raises up those who have wandered in error. \"Awake,\" He says, \"thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light,\"[fn-31-P3153_916523:106-nf] -Christ, the Sun of the Resurrection, He \"who was born before the morning star,\"[fn-31-P3154_916623:107-nf] and with His beams bestows life.

If you wish to learn, the Holy Spirit will show you: \"And saw my works,\" He says, \"forty years.

So I sware in my wrath, they shall not enter into My rest.\"[fn-31-P3156_917259:109-nf] Look to the threatening! Look to the exhortation! Look to the punishment! Why, then, should we any longer change grace into wrath, and not receive the word with open ears, and entertain God as a guest in pure spirits? For great is the grace of His promise, \"if to-day we hear His voice.\"[fn-31-P3157_917568:110-nf] And that to-day is lengthened out day by day, while it is called to-day.

For the to-day signifies eternity. And day is the symbol of light; and the light of men is the Word, by whom we behold God.

They that are offended in Christ, and in the Church. They that are offended in Christ, are as if burnt by the sun, those in the Church as by the moon. But the Psalm saith, \"The sun shall not burn thee by day, neither the moon by night:[fn-40-P4030_2215152:62-nf] i.e., if thou hold fast charity, neither in Christ shall thou have occasion of falling, nor in the Church; neither Christ shall thou forsake, nor the Church. For he that forsakes the Church, how is he in Christ who is not in the members of Christ? How is he in Christ who is not in the body of Christ? Those therefore take scandal, or, occasion of failing, who forsake Christ or the Church. Whence do we understand that the Psalm in saying, \"By day shall the sun not burn thee, nor the moon by night,\" saith it of this, that the burning means scandal, or occasion of stumbling? In the first place mark the similitude itself. Just as the person whom something is burning saith, I cannot bear it, I cannot away with it, and draws back; so those persons who cannot bear some things in the Church, and withdraw themselves either from the name of Christ or from the Church, are taking scandal. For see how those took scandal as from the sun, those carnal ones to whom Christ preached of His flesh, saying, \"He that eateth not the flesh of the Son of Man and drinketh His blood, shall have no life in him.\"[fn-40-P4031_2216272:63-nf] Some seventy persons[fn-40-P4032_2216314:64-nf] said, \"Thisis an hard saying,\" and went back from Him, and there remained the twelve. All those the sun burnt, and they went back, not being able to bear the force of the Word. There remained therefore the twelve. And lest haply men should imagine that they confer a benefit upon Christ by believing on Christ, and not that the benefit is conferred by Him upon them; when the twelve were left, the Lord said to them, \"Will ye also go?\" That ye may know that I am necessary to you, not ye to me. But those whom the sun had not burnt, answered by the voice of Peter: \"Lord, Thou hast the word[fn-40-P4033_2217969:65-nf] of eternal life; whither shall we go?\" But who are they that the Church as the moon burneth by night? They that have made schisms. Hear the very word used in the apostle: \"Who is offended, and I burn not?\"[fn-40-P4034_2218188:66-nf] In what sense then is it, that there is no scandal or occasion of stumbling in him that loveth his brother? Because he that loveth his brother, beareth all things for unity's sake; because it is in the unity of charity that brotherly love exists. Some one, I know not who, offendeth thee: whether it be a bad man, or as thou supposest a bad man, or as thou pretendest a bad man: and dost thou desert so many good men? What sort of brotherly love is that which hath appeared in these[fn-40-P4035_2218691:67-nf] persons? While they accuse the Africans, they have deserted the whole world! What, were there no saints in the whole world? Or was it possible they should be condemned by you unheard? But oh! if ye loved your brethren, there would be none occasion of stumbling in you. Hear thou the Psalm, what it saith: \"Great peace have they that love Thy law, and there is to them none occasion of stumbling.\"[fn-40-P4036_2219104:68-nf] Great peace it saith there is for them that love the law of God, and that is why there is to them none occasion of stumbling. Those then who take scandal, or, occasion of stumbling, destroy peace. And of whom saith he that they take not and make not occasion of stumbling? They that love God's law. Consequently they are in charity. But some man will say, \"He said it of them that love God's law, not of the brethren.\" Hear thou what the Lord saith: \"A new commandment give I unto you that ye love one another.\"[fn-40-P4037_2219636:69-nf] What is the Law but commandment?

And he who fulfils this commandment is in reality a child and a son to God and to the world,-to the one as deceived, to the other as beloved. And if we have one Master in heaven, as the Scripture says, then by common consent those on the earth will be rightly called disciples. For so is the truth, that perfection is with the Lord, who is always teaching, and infancy and childishness with us, who are always learning. Thus prophecy hath honoured perfection, by applying to it the appellation man. For instance, by David, He says of the devil: \"The Lord abhors the man of blood; \"[fn-33-P3361_1001079:37-nf] he calls him man, as perfect in wickedness. And the Lord is called man, because He is perfect in righteousness. Directly in point is the instance of the apostle, who says, writing the Corinthians: \"For I have espoused you to one man, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ,\"[fn-33-P3362_1001382:38-nf] whether as children or saints, but to the Lord alone. And writing to the Ephesians, he has unfolded in the clearest manner the point in question, speaking to the following effect: \"Till we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: that we be no longer children, tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine, by the craft of men, by their cunning in stratagems of deceit; but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up to Him in all things,\"[fn-33-P3363_1001938:39-nf] -saying these things in order to the edification of the body of Christ, who is the head and man, the only one perfect in righteousness; and we who are children guarding against the blasts of heresies, which blow to our inflation; and not putting our trust in fathers who teach us otherwise, are then made perfect when we are the church, having received Christ the head. Then it is right to notice, with respect to the appellation of infant (nh/pioj), that to\\ nh/pion is not predicated of the silly: for the silly man is called nhpu/tioj: and nh/pioj is neh/pioj (since he that is tender-hearted is calledh !pioj), as being one that has newly become gentle and meek in Conduct. This the blessed Paul most clearly pointed out when he said, \"When we might have been burdensome as the apostles of Christ, we were gentle (h !pioi) among you, as a nurse cherisheth her children.\"[fn-33-P3364_1002835:40-nf] The child (nh/pioj) is therefore gentle (h !pioj), and therefore more tender, delicate, and simple, guileless, and destitute of hypocrisy, straightforward and upright in mind, which is the basis of simplicity and truth. For He says, \"Upon whom shall I look, but upon him who is gentle and quiet? \"[fn-33-P3365_1003156:41-nf] For such is the virgin speech, tender, and free of fraud; whence also a virgin is wont to be called \"a tender bride,\" and a child \"tender-hearted.\" And we are tender who are pliant to the power of persuasion, and are easily drawn to goodness, and are mild, and free of the stain of malice and perverseness, for the ancient race was perverse and hard-hearted; but the band of infants, the new people which we are, i.s delicate as a child. On account of the hearts of the innocent, the apostle, in the Epistle to the Romans, owns that he rejoices, and furnishes a kind of definition of children, so to speak, when he says, \"I would have you wise toward good, but simple towards evil.\"[fn-33-P3366_1003858:42-nf] For the name of child, nh/pioj, is not understood by us privatively, though the sons of the grammarians make thenh a privative particle. For if they call us who follow after childhood foolish, see how they utter blasphemy against the Lord, in regarding those as foolish who have betaken themselves to God. But if, which is rather the true sense, they themselves understand the designation children of simple ones, we glory in the name. For the new minds, which have newly become wise, which have sprung into being according to the new covenant, are infantile in the old folly.

But God made man in the image of God; He is therefore God who made man in the image of God; therefore Christ is God: so that with reason neither does the testimony of the Old Testament waver concerning the person of Christ, being supported by the manifestation of the New Testament; nor is the power of the New Testament detracted from, while its truth is resting on the roots of the same Old Testament. Whence they who presume Christ the Son of God and man to be only man, and not God also, do so in opposition to both Old and New Testaments, in that they corrupt the authority and the truth both of the Old and New Testaments. What if the same Moses everywhere introduces God the Father infinite and without end, not as being enclosed in any place, but as one who includes every place; nor as one who is in a place, but rather one in whom every place is, containing all things and embracing all things, so that with reason He can neither descend nor ascend, because He Himself both contains and fills all things, and yet nevertheless introduces God descending to consider the tower which the sons of men were building, asking and saying, \"Come; \"and then, \"Let us go down and there confound their tongues, that each one may not understand the words of his neighbour.\"[fn-102-P10270_3212070:129-nf] Whom do they pretend here to have been the God who descended to that tower, and asking to visit those men at that time?

There are great proofs of this existing on the part of the blessed martyr Cyprian, in his letters,-to come at last to him of whose authority they carnally flatter themselves they are possessed, whilst by his love they are spiritually overthrown. For at that time, before the consent of the whole Church had declared authoritatively, by the decree of a plenary Council,[fn-31-P3146_1837518:54-nf] what practice should be followed in this matter, it seemed to him, in common with about eighty of his fellow bishops of the African churches, that every man who had been baptized outside the communion of the Catholic Church should, on joining the Church, be baptized anew. And I take it, that the reason why the Lord did not reveal the error in this to a man of such eminence, was, that his pious humility and charity in guarding the peace and health of the Church might be made manifest, and might be noticed, so as to serve as an example of healing power, so to speak, not only to Christians of that age, but also to those who should come after. For when a bishop of so important a Church, himself a man of so great merit and virtue, endowed with such excellence of heart and power of eloquence, entertained an opinion about baptism different from that which was to be confirmed by a more diligent searching into the truth; though many of his colleagues held what was not yet made manifest by authority, but was sanctioned by the past custom of the Church, and afterwards embraced by the whole Catholic world; yet under these circumstances he did not sever himself, by refusal of communion, from the others who thought differently, and indeed never ceased to urge on the others that they should \"forbear one another in love, endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.\"[fn-31-P3147_1838935:55-nf] For so, while the framework of the body remained whole, if any infirmity occurred in certain of its members, it might rather regain its health from their general soundness, than be deprived of the chance of any healing care by their death in severance from the body. And if he had severed himself, how many were there to follow! what a name was he likely to make for himself among men! how much more widely would the name of Cyprianist have spread than that of Donatist! But he was not a son of perdition, one of those of whom it is said, \"Thou castedst them down while they were elevated;\"[fn-31-P3148_1839546:56-nf] but he was the son of the peace of the Church, who in the clear illumination of his mind failed to see one thing, only that through him another thing might be more excellently seen. \"And yet,\" says the apostle, \"show I unto you a more excellent way: though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.\"[fn-31-P3149_1839959:57-nf] He had therefore imperfect insight into the hidden mystery of the sacrament. But if he had known the mysteries of all sacraments, without having charity, it would have been nothing. But as he, with imperfect insight into the mystery, was careful to preserve charity with all courage and humility and faith, he deserved to come to the crown of martyrdom; so that, if any cloud had crept over the clearness of his intellect from his infirmity as man, it might be dispelled by the glorious brightness of his blood. For it was not in vain that our Lord Jesus Christ, when He declared Himself to be the vine, and His disciples, as it were, the branches in the vine, gave command that those which bare no fruit should be cut off, and removed from the vine as useless branches.[fn-31-P3150_1840760:58-nf] But what is really fruit, save that new offspring, of which He further says, \"A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another?\"[fn-31-P3151_1840919:59-nf] This is that very charity, without which the rest profiteth nothing. The apostle also says: \"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance;\"[fn-31-P3152_1841149:60-nf] which all begin with charity, and with the rest of the combination forms one unity in a kind of wondrous cluster.[fn-31-P3153_1841284:61-nf] Nor is it again in vain that our Lord added, \"And every branch that beareth fruit, my Father purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit,\"[fn-31-P3154_1841439:62-nf] but because those who are strong in the fruit of charity may yet have something which requires purging, which the Husbandman will not leave untended. Whilst then, that holy man entertained on the subject of baptism an opinion at variance with the true view, which was afterwards thoroughly examined and confirmed after most diligent consideration, his error was compensated by his remaining in catholic unity, and by the abundance of his charity; and finally it was cleared away by the pruning-hook of martyrdom.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_55_book_i_","source_chapter":36,"source_paragraph":"148","folder":"ANF-04","text":"But that we may not seem, because of a Hebrew word, to endeavour to persuade those who are unable to determine whether they ought to believe it or not, that the prophet spoke of this man being born of a virgin, because at his birth these words, \"God with us,\" were uttered, let us make good our point from the words themselves. The Lord is related to have spoken to Ahaz thus: \"Ask a sign for thyself from the Lord thy God, either in the depth or height above; \"[fn-78-P7804_1853970:60-nf] and afterwards the sign is given, Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son.\"[fn-78-P7805_1854077:61-nf] What kind of sign, then, would that have been-a young woman who was not a virgin giving birth to a child?

I am able, he declares, to speak of far greater miracles; but I am unwilling; lest the magnitude of the miracles should raise too high a notion of me among men. For this reason Peter also, when they[fn-15-P1598_1275997:33-nf] had restored the lame man, and all were wondering at them, in order to restrain the people, and persuade them that they had exhibited nothing of this power of themselves, or from their native strength, says, \"Why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?\"[fn-15-P1599_1276671:34-nf] And again at Lystra, the people were not only filled with astonishment, but led forth bulls, after crowning them with garlands, and were preparing to offer sacrifice to Paul and Barnabas.

By those very same persons through whom the Lord was at work, to purge out ungodliness from the world, by the same did that enemy try to introduce it, again persuading them to take men for gods; which was what he had done in former times. And this is especially that which introduced the principle and root of idolatry. For many after having had success in wars, and set up trophies, and built cities, and done divers other benefits of this kind to the people of those times, came to be esteemed gods by the multitude, and were honoured with temples, and altars; and the whole catalogue of the Grecian gods is made up of such men. That this, therefore, may not be done towards the Saints,[fn-16-P1600_1277618:35-nf] God permitted them constantly to be banished,-to be scourged,-to fall into diseases; that the abundance of bodily infirmity, and the multiplicity of those temptations, might convince those who were then with them, both that they were men, who wrought such wonders, and that they contributed nothing of their own power; but that it was mere grace, that wrought through them all these miracles. For if they took men for gods, who had done but mean and vile things, much rather would they have thought these to be such, had they suffered nothing proper to humanity, when they performed miracles, such as no one had ever before Seen or heard of.

Wherefore, putting away lying, speak every man truth. Neither give place to the devil.

And thus sins, because they are not forgiven out of the Church, must be forgiven by that Spirit, by whom the Church is gathered together into one. In fact, if any one out of the Church repent him of his sins, and for this so great sin whereby he is an alien from the Church of God, has an heart impenitent, what doth that other repentance profit him? seeing by this alone he speaketh a word against the Holy Ghost, whereby he is alienated from the Church, which hath received this gift, that in her remission of sins should be given in the Holy Ghost? Which remission though it be the work of the Whole Trinity, is yet understood specially to belong to the Holy Spirit.

Nor is it material, when we are considering the question of the genuineness and holiness of the sacrament, \"what the recipient of the sacrament believes, and with what faith he is imbued.\" It is of the very highest consequence as regards the entrance into salvation, but is wholly immaterial as regards the question of the sacrament. For it is quite possible that a man may be possessed of the genuine sacrament and a corrupted faith, as it is possible that he may hold the words of the creed in their integrity, and yet entertain an erroneous belief about the Trinity, or the resurrection, or any other point. For it is no slight matter, even within the Catholic Church itself, to hold a faith entirely consistent with the truth about even God Himself, to say nothing of any of His creatures. Is it then to be maintained, that if any one who has been baptized within the Catholic Church itself should afterwards, in the course of reading, or by listening to instruction, or by quiet argument, find out, through God's own revelation, that he had before believed otherwise than he ought, it is requisite that he should therefore be baptized afresh? But what carnal and natural man is there who does not stray through the vain conceits[fn-33-P3343_1922344:26-nf] of his own heart, and picture God's nature to himself to be such as he has imagined out of his carnal sense, and differ from the true conception of God as far as vanity from truth? Most truly, indeed, speaks the apostle, filled with the light of truth: \"The natural man,\" says he, \"receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God.\"[fn-33-P3344_1922692:27-nf] And yet herein he was speaking of men whom he himself shows to have been baptized. For he says to them, \"Was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?\"[fn-33-P3345_1922886:28-nf] These men had therefore the sacrament of baptism; and yet, inasmuch as their wisdom was of the flesh, what could they believe about God otherwise than according to the perception of their flesh, according to which \"the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God?\" To such he says: \"I could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. I have fed you with milk, and not with meal: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able. For ye are yet carnal.\"[fn-33-P3346_1923438:29-nf] For such are carried about with every wind of doctrine, of which kind he says, \"That we be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine.\"[fn-33-P3347_1923634:30-nf] It is then true that, if these men shall have advanced even to the spiritual age of the inner man, and in the integrity of understanding shall have learned how far different from the requirements of the truth has been the belief which they have been led by the fallacious character of their conceits to entertain of God, they are therefore to be baptized again? For, on this principle, it would be possible for a Catholic catechumen to light upon the writings of some heretic, and, not having the knowledge requisite for discerning truth from error, he might entertain some belief contrary to the Catholic faith, yet not condemned by the words of the creed, just as, under color of the same words, innumerable heretical errors have sprung up. Supposing, then, that the catechumen was under the impression that he was studying the work of some great and learned Catholic, and was baptized with that belief in the Catholic Church, and by subsequent research should discover what he ought to believe, so that, embracing the Catholic faith, he should reject his former error, ought he, on confessing this, to be baptized again? Or supposing that, before learning and confessing this for himself, he should be found to entertain such an opinion, and should be taught what he ought to reject and what he should believe, and it were to become clear that he had held this false belief when he was baptized, ought he therefore to be baptized again? Why should we maintain the contrary? Because the sanctity of the sacrament, consecrated in the words of the gospel, remains upon him in, its integrity, just as he received it from the hands of the minister, although he, being firmly rooted in the vanity of his carnal mind entertained a belief other than was right at the time when he was baptized. Wherefore it is manifest that it is possible that, with defective faith, the sacrament of baptism may yet remain without defect in any man; and therefore all that is said about the diversity of the several heretics is beside the question. For in each person that is to be corrected which is found to be amiss by the man who undertakes his correction. That is to be made whole which is unsound; that is to be given which is wanting, and, above all, the peace of Christian charity, without which the rest is profitless. Yet, as the rest is there, we must not administer it as though it were wanting, only take care that its possession be to the profit, not the hurt of him who has it, through the very bond of peace and excellence of charity.","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_59_book_ii","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"ANF-01","text":"Now, that this God is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Paul the apostle also has declared, [saying, ] \"There is one God, the Father, who is above all, and through all things, and in us all.\"[fn-67-P6751_1644828:12-nf] I have indeed proved already that there is only one God; but I shall further demonstrate this from the apostles themselves, and from the discourses of the Lord.

I have already, I think, argued to the best of my power, in the preceding books, in the interests of Catholic unanimity and counsel, in whose unity these continued as pious members, in reply not only to the letter which Cyprian wrote to Jubaianus, but also to that which he sent to Quintus, and that which, in conjunction with certain of his colleagues, he sent to certain other colleagues, and that which he sent to Pompeius. Wherefore it seems now to be fitting to consider also what the others severally thought, and that with the liberty of which he himself would not deprive us, as he says, \"Judging no one, nor removing any from the right of communion if he entertain different opinions.\" And that he did not say this with the object of arriving at the hidden thoughts of his colleagues, extracted as it were from their secret lurking-places, but because he really loved peace and unity, is very easily to be seen from other passages of the same sort, where he wrote to individuals as to Jubaianus himself. \"These things,\" he says, \"we have written very shortly in answer to you, most beloved brother, according to our poor ability, not preventing any one of the bishops by our writing or judgment, from acting as he thinks right, having a free exercise of his own judgment.\"[fn-38-P3876_2125140:12-nf] And that it might not seem that any one, because of his entertaining different opinions in this same free exercise of his judgment, should be driven from the society of his brethren, he goes on to say, \"We, so far as lies in us, do not strive on behalf of heretics against our colleagues and fellow-bishops, with whom we maintain godly unity and the peace of our Lord;\"[fn-38-P3877_2125537:13-nf] and a little later he says, \"Charity of spirit, respect for our fraternity, the bond of faith, the harmony of the priesthood, are by us maintained with patience and gentleness.\"[fn-38-P3878_2125742:14-nf] And so also in the epistle which he wrote to Magnus, when he was asked whether there was any difference in the efficacy of baptism by sprinkling \"or by immersion, \"In this matter,\" he says, \"I am too modest and diffident to prevent any one by my judgment from thinking as he deems right, and acting as he thinks.\"[fn-38-P3879_2126083:15-nf] By which discourses he clearly shows that these subjects were being handled by them at a time when they were not yet received as decided beyond all question, but were being investigated with great care as being yet unrevealed. We, therefore, maintaining on the subject of the identity of all baptisms what must be acknowledged everywhere to be the custom[fn-38-P3880_2126463:16-nf] of the universal Church, and what is confirmed by the decision of general Councils,[fn-38-P3881_2126811:17-nf] and taking greater confidence also from the words of Cyprian, which allowed me even then to hold opinions differing from his own without forfeiting the right of communion, seeing that greater importance and praise were attached to unity, such as the blessed Cyprian and his colleagues, with whom he held that Council, maintained with those of different opinions, disturbing and overthrowing thereby the seditious calumnies of heretics and schismatics in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, who, speaking by His apostle, says, \"Forbearing one another in love, endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace;\"[fn-38-P3882_2127466:18-nf] and again, by the mouth of the same apostle, \"If in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you,\"[fn-38-P3883_2127609:19-nf] -we, I say, propose for consideration and discussion the opinions of the holy bishops, without violating the bond of unity and peace with them, in maintaining which we imitate them so far as we can by the aid of the Lord Himself.

III, therefore, for themselves do some interpret, saying that by imposition of hands they receive the Holy Ghost, and are received into the Church, when it is manifest that they ought to be born again by both sacraments in the Catholic Church. For then indeed will they be able to become the sons of God, as the apostle says, `Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God.'[fn-39-P3916_2138057:34-nf] All this the Catholic Church asserts.

Quod si in externum mundum venerint, qui in alieno non fuerint fideles, verum non babebunt.

Oporteret enim eos, cum in alienis adsunt, recte vivere, ut revera regiam indolem ostenderent. Jam vero et humanos legislatores, et divinam legera habent sibi infensam, cum inique et praeter leges vivere instituerint. Is certe, qui scortatorein \"confodit,\" a Deo plus esse ostenditur in Numeris. \"Et si dixerimus,\" inquit Joannes in epistola, \"quod societatem habemus cum eo,\" nempe Deo, \"et in tenebris ambulamus, mentitour, et veritatem non facimus.

Who then is perfect? He who professes abstinence from what is bad. Well, this is the way to the Gospel and to well-doing. But gnostic perfection in the case of the legal man is the acceptance of the Gospel, that he that is after the law may be perfect. For so he, who was after the law, Moses, foretold that it was necessary to hear in order that we might, according to the apostle, receive Christ, the fulness of the law.[fn-69-P6998_2138780:194-nf] But now in the Gospel the Gnostic attains proficiency not only by making use of the law as a step, but by understanding and comprehending it, as the Lord who gave the Covenants delivered it to the apostles. And if he conduct himself rightly (as assuredly it is impossible to attain knowledge (gnosis) by bad conduct); and if, further, having made an eminently right confession, he become a martyr out of love, obtaining considerable renown as among men; not even thus will he be called perfect in the flesh beforehand; since it is the close of life which claims this appellation, when the gnostic martyr has first shown the perfect work, and rightly exhibited it, and having thankfully shed his blood, has yielded up the ghost: blessed then will he be, and truly proclaimed perfect, \"that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us,\" as the apostle says.

For ye sorrowed after a godly sort, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing. For godly sorrow worketh repentance unto salvation not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world worketh death.

Besides, what wilt thou say of those who are in many cases baptized by bishops of very bad character, who yet at length, when God so wills it, convicted of their crimes, are even deprived of their office itself, or absolutely of communion? Or what wilt thou decide of those who may have been baptized by bishops, whose opinions are unsound, or who are very ignorant-when they may not have spoken clearly and honestly, or even have spoken otherwise than is fit in the tradition of the sacrament, or at least may have asked anything, or asking, have heard from those who answered what ought by no means to be so asked or answered? And still this does not greatly injure that true faith of ours, although, moreover, these more simple men may deliver the mystery of the faith without the elegance and order that thou wouldst use. And thou wilt assuredly say, with that marvellous carefulness of thine, that these too should be baptized again, since this is especially the thing which is wanting to them, or hinders their being able to receive, uncorrupted, that divine and inviolable mystery of the faith. And yet, O excellent man, let us attribute and allow to the heavenly agencies their power, and let us concede to the condescension of the divine majesty its appropriate operations; and understanding how great is the advantage therein, let us gladly acquiesce in it. And thus, as our salvation is founded in the baptism of the Spirit, which for the most part is associated with the baptism of water, if indeed baptism shall be given by us, let it be conferred in its integrity and with solemnity, and with all those meanswhich are written; and let it be administered without any disconnection of anything. Or if, by the necessity of the case, it should be administered by an inferior cleric, let us wait for the result, that it may either be supplied by us,[fn-107-P10758_3406644:28-nf] or reserved to be supplied by the Lord. If, however, it should have been administered by strangers, let this matter be amended as it can and as it allows. Because outside the Church there is no Holy Spirit, sound faith moreover cannot exist, not alone among heretics, but even among those who are established in schism. And for that reason, they who repent and are amended by the doctrine of the truth, and by their own faith, which subsequently has been improved by the purification of their heart, ought to be aided only by spiritual baptism, that is, by the imposition of the bishop's hands, and by the ministration of the Holy Spirit. Moreover, the perfect seal of faith has been rightly accustomed to be given in this manner and on this principle in the Church. So that the invocation of the name of Jesus, which cannot be done away, may not seem to be held in disesteem by us; which assuredly is not fitting; although such an invocation, if none of those things of which we have spoken should follow it, may fail and be deprived of the effect of salvation. For when the apostle said that there was \"one baptism,\"[fn-107-P10759_3407870:29-nf] it must needs have been by the continued effect of the invocation of the name of Jesus, because, once invoked, it cannot be taken away by any man, even although we might venture, against the decision of the apostles, to repeat it by giving too much, yea, by the desire of superadding baptism. If he who returns to the Church be unwilling again to be baptized, the result will be that we may defraud him of the baptism of the Spirit, whom we think we must not defraud of the baptism of water.","title":"A Treatise on Re-Baptism by an Anonymous Writer.","author":"Appendix"},{"chapter":4,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_54_vi_conference_of_abbot_theodore_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"53","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Well then, though we say that trial is twofold, i.e., in prosperity and in adversity, yet you must know that all men are tried in three different ways. Often for their probation, sometimes for their improvement, and in some cases because their sins deserve it. For their probation indeed, as we read that the blessed Abraham and Job and many of the saints endured countless tribulations; or this which is said to the people in Deuteronomy by Moses: \"And thou shalt remember all the way through which the Lord thy God hath brought thee for forty years through the desert, to afflict thee and to prove thee, and that the things that were in thy heart might be made known, whether thou wouldst keep His Commandments or no:\"[fn-43-P4327_1597865:37-nf] and this which we find in the Psalms: \"I proved thee at the waters of strife.\"[fn-43-P4328_1597964:38-nf] To Job also: \"Thinkest thou that I have spoken for any other cause than that thou mightest be seen to be righteous?\"[fn-43-P4329_1598108:39-nf] But for improvement, when God chastens his righteous ones for some small and venial sins, or to raise them to a higher state of purity, and delivers them over to various trials, that He may purge away all their unclean thoughts, and, to use the prophet's word, the \"dross,\" which he sees to have collected in their secret parts, and may thus transmit them like pure gold, to the judgment to come, as He allows nothing to remain in them for the fire of judgment to discover when hereafter it searches them with penal torments according to this saying: \"Many are the tribulations of the righteous.\"[fn-43-P4330_1598728:40-nf] And: \"My son, neglect not the discipline of the Lord, neither be thou wearied whilst thou art rebuked by Him. For whom the Lord loveth He chastiseth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth. For what son is there whom the father doth not correct? But if ye are without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.\"[fn-43-P4331_1599108:41-nf] And in the Apocalypse: \"Those whom I love, I reprove and chasten.\"[fn-43-P4332_1599195:42-nf] To whom under the figure of Jerusalem the following words are spoken by Jeremiah, in the person of God: \"For I will utterly consume all the nations among which I scattered thee: but I will not utterly consume thee: but I will chastise thee in judgment, that thou mayest not seem to thyself innocent.\"[fn-43-P4333_1599515:43-nf] And for this life-giving cleansing David prays when he says: \"Prove me, O Lord, and try me; turn my reins and my heart.\"[fn-43-P4334_1599655:44-nf] Isaiah also, well knowing the value of this trial, says \"O Lord, correct us but with judgment: not in Thine anger.\"[fn-43-P4335_1599796:45-nf] And again: \"I will give thanks to thee, O Lord, for thou wast angry with me: Thy wrath is turned away, and Thou hast comforted me.\"[fn-43-P4336_1599985:46-nf] But as a punishment for sins, the blows of trial are inflicted, as where the Lord threatens that He will send plagues upon the people of Israel: \"I will send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the fury of creatures that trail upon the ground:\"[fn-43-P4337_1600247:47-nf] and \"In vain have I struck your children: they have not received correction.\"[fn-43-P4338_1600347:48-nf] In the Psalms also: \"Many are the scourges of the sinners:\"[fn-43-P4339_1600425:49-nf] and in the gospel: \"Behold thou art made whole: now sin no more, lest a worse thing happen unto thee.\"[fn-43-P4340_1600556:50-nf] We find, it is true, a fourth way also in which we know on the authority of Scripture that some sufferings are brought upon us simply for the manifestation of the glory of God and His works, according to these words of the gospel: \"Neither did this man sin nor his parents, but that the works of God might be manifested in him:\"[fn-43-P4341_1600905:51-nf] and again: \"This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God that the Son of God may be glorified by it.\"[fn-43-P4342_1601040:52-nf] There are also other sorts of vengeance, with which some who have overpassed the bounds of wickedness are smitten in this life, as we read that Dathan and Abiram or Korah were punished, or above all, those of whom the Apostle speaks: \"Wherefore God gave them up to vile passions and a reprobate mind:\"[fn-43-P4343_1601362:53-nf] and this must be counted worse than all other punishments. For of these the Psalmist says: \"They are not in the labours of men; neither shall they be scourged like other men.\"[fn-43-P4344_1601559:54-nf] For theyare not worthy of being healed by the visitation of the Lord which gives life, and by plagues in this world, as \"in despair they have given themselves over to lasciviousness, unto the working of all error unto uncleanness,\"[fn-43-P4345_1601820:55-nf] and as by hardening their hearts, and by growing accustomed and used to sin they have got beyond cleansing in this brief life and punishment in the present world: men, who are thus reproved by the holy word of the prophet: \"I destroyed some of you, as God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet you returned not to Me, saith the Lord,\"[fn-43-P4346_1602225:56-nf] and Jeremiah: \"I have killed and destroyed thy people, and yet they are not returned from their ways.\"[fn-43-P4347_1602346:57-nf] And again: \"Thou hast smitten them and they have not grieved: Thou hast bruised them and they refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than the rock, they have refused to return.\"[fn-43-P4348_1602567:58-nf] And the prophet seeing that all the remedies of this life will have been applied in vain for their healing, and already as it were despairing of their life, declares: \"The bellows have failed in the fire, the founder hath melted in vain: for their wicked deeds are not consumed. Call them reprobate silver, for the Lord hath rejected them.\"[fn-43-P4349_1602924:59-nf] And the Lord thus laments that to no purpose has He applied this salutary cleansing by fire to those who are hardened in their sins, in the person of Jerusalem crusted all over with the rust of her sins, when He says: \"set it empty upon burning coals, that it may be hot, and the brass thereof may be melted; and let the filth of it be melted in the midst thereof. Great pains have been taken, and the great rust thereof is not gone out, no not even by fire. Thy uncleanness is execrable: because I desired to cleanse thee, and thou art not cleansed from thy filthiness.\"[fn-43-P4350_1603518:60-nf] Wherefore like a skilful physician, who has tried all saving cures, and sees there is no remedy left which can be applied to their disease, the Lord is in a manner overcome by their iniquities and is obliged to desist from that kindly chastisement of His, and so denounces them saying: \"I will no longer be angry with thee, and thy jealousy has departed from thee.\"[fn-43-P4351_1603908:61-nf] But of others, whose heart has not grown hard by continuance in sin, and who do not stand in need of that most severe and (if I may so call it) caustic remedy, but for whose salvation the instruction of the life-giving word is suffi- cient-of them it is said: \"I will improve them by hearing of their suffering.\"[fn-43-P4352_1604242:62-nf] We are well aware that there are other reasons also of the punishment and vengeance whichis inflicted on those who have sinned grievously-not to expiate their crimes, nor wipeout the deserts of their sins, but that the living may be put in fear and amend their lives. And these we plainly see were inflicted on Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and Baasha the son of Ahiah, and Ahab and Jezebel, when the Divine reproof thus declares: \"Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will cut down thy posterity, and will kill of Ahab every male, and him that is shut up and the last in Israel. And I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahiah: for that which thou hast done to provoke Me to anger, and for making Israel to sin. The dogs also shall eat Jezebel in the field of Jezreel. If Ahab die in the city, the dogs shall eat him: but if he die in the field the birds of the air shall eat him,\"[fn-43-P4353_1605220:63-nf] and this which is threatened as the greatest threat of all: \"Thy dead body shall not be brought to the sepulchre of thy fathers.\"[fn-43-P4354_1605375:64-nf] It was not that this short and momentary punishment would suffice to purge away the blasphemous inventions of him who first made the golden calves and led to the lasting sin of the people, and their wicked separation from the Lord,-or the countless and disgraceful profanities of those others, but it was that by their example the fear of those punishments which they dreaded might fall on others also, who, as they thought little of the future or even disbelieved in it altogether, would only be moved by consideration of things present; and that owing to this proof of His severity they might acknowledge that there is no lack of care for the affairs of men, and for their daily doings, in the majesty of God on high, and so through that which they greatly feared might the more clearly See in God the rewarder of all their deeds. We find, it is true, that even for lighter faults some men have received the same sentence of death in this world, as that with which those men were punished who, as we said before, were the authors of a blasphemous falling away: as happened in the case of the man who gathered sticks on the Sabbath,[fn-43-P4355_1606532:65-nf] and in that of Ananias and Sapphira, who through the sin of unbelief kept back some portion of their goods: not that the guilt of their sins was equal, but because they were the firstfound out in a new kind of transgression, and so it was right that as they had given to others an example of sin, so also they should give them an example of punishment and of fear, that anyone, who should attempt to copy them, might know that (even if his punishment were postponed in this life) he would be punished in the same way that they were at the trial of the judgment hereafter. And, since in our desire to run through the different kinds of trials and punishments we seem to have wandered somewhat from our subject, on which we were saying that the perfect man will always remain steadfast in either kind of trial, now let us return to it once more.","title":"VI.

And therefore the mind cannot possibly remain in one and the same state. Just as when a man, by pulling hard, is trying to force a boat against the stream of a strong current he must either stem the rush of the torrent by the force of his arms, and so mount to what is higher up, or letting his hands slacken be whirled headlong down stream. Wherefore it will be a clear proof of our failure if we find that we have gained nothing more, nor should we doubt but that we have altogether gone back, whenever we find that we have not advanced upwards, because, as I said, the mind of man cannot possibly continue in the same condition, nor so long as he is in the flesh will any of the saints ever reach the height of all virtues, so that they continue unalterable. For something must either be added to them or taken away from them, and in no creature can there be such perfection, as not to be subject to the feeling of change; as we read in the book of Job: \"What is man that he should be without spot, and he that is born of a woman that he should appear just? Behold among His saints none is unchangeable, and the heavens are not pure in His sight.\"[fn-43-P4370_1609887:68-nf] For we confess that God only is unchangeable, who alone is thus addressed by the prayer of the holy prophet \"But Thou art the same,\"[fn-43-P4371_1610041:69-nf] and who says of Himself \"I am God, and I change not,\"[fn-43-P4372_1610119:70-nf] because He alone is by nature always good, always full and perfect, and one to whom nothing can ever be added, or from whom nothing can be taken away. And so we ought always with incessant care and anxiety to give ourselves up to the acquirement of virtue, and constantly to occupy ourselves with the practice of it, lest, if we ceaseto go forward, the result should immediately be a going back. For, as we said, the mind cannot continue in one and the same condition, I mean without receiving addition to or diminution of its good qualities. For to fail to gain new ones, is to lose them, because when the desire of making progress ceases, there the danger of going back is present.","title":"VI.

Next, however, with regard to your statement that there is indeed one baptism,[fn-49-P4968_2435778:111-nf] but that it is consecrated in three several grades, and to your having distributed the three forms of it to three persons after such fashion, that you ascribe the water to John, the Holy Spirit to the Lord Jesus Christ, and, in the third place, the fire to the Comforter sent down from above,-consider for a moment in how great an error you are involved. For you were brought to entertain such an opinion simply from the words of John:\"I indeed baptize you with water: but He that cometh after me is mightier than I: He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.\"[fn-49-P4969_2436372:112-nf] Nor were you willing to take into consideration that the three things are not attributed to three persons taken one by one,-water to John, the Holy Spirit to Christ, fire to the Comforter,-but that the three should rather be referred to two persons-one of them to John, the other two to our Lord. For neither is it said, I indeed baptize you with water: but He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost: and the Comforter, who is to come after Him, He shall baptize you with fire; but \"I indeed,\" He says, \"with water: but He that cometh after me with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.\" One he attributes to himself, two to Him that cometh after him. You see, therefore, how you have been deceived in the number. Listen further. You said that there was one baptism consecrated in three stages-water, the Holy Spirit, and fire; and you assigned three persons to the three stages severally-John to the water, Christ to the Spirit, the Comforter to the fire. If, therefore, the water of John bears reference to the same baptism which is commended as being one, it was not right that those should have been baptized a second time by the command of the Apostle Paul whom he found to have been baptized by John. For they already had water, belonging, as you say, to the same baptism; so that it remained that they should receive the Holy Spirit and fire, because these were wanting in the baptism of John, that their baptism might be completed, being consecrated, as you assert, in three stages. But since they were ordered to be baptized by the authority of an apostle, it is sufficiently made manifest that that water with which John baptized had no reference to the baptism of Christ, but belonged to another dispensation suited to the exigencies of the times.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_61_book_ii_","source_chapter":68,"source_paragraph":"327","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"155.

If you do not prove these charges, they tell against no one in the world; and if you prove them, they have no bearing upon us; just as those things have no bearing upon you which are daily done by the furious deeds of the insane, by the luxury of the drunken, by the blindness of the suicides, by the tyranny of robbers.

For how neatly it is said under covering of the sheep's clothing, \"Charity beareth all things, endureth all things!\" but when you come to the test, the wolf's teeth cannot be concealed. For when, in obedience to the words of Scripture, \"forbearing one another in love, endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,\"[fn-52-P5264_2542977:220-nf] charity would compel you, even if you knew of any evils within the Church, I do not say to consent to them, but yet to tolerate them if you could not prevent them, test, on account of the wicked who are to be separated by the winnowing-fan at the last day, you should at the present time sever the bond of peace by breaking off from the society of good men, you, resisting her influence, and being cast out by the wind of levity, charge the wheat with being chaff, and declare that what you invent of the wicked holds good through the force of contagion even in the righteous.

And yet, that it may not appear that the party of Donatus, which does not communicate with the several nations of the world, is involved in error, if any angel from heaven, who could see the whole world, were to declare that outside your communion good and innocent men were nowhere to be found, there is little doubt that you would rejoice over the iniquity of the human race, and boast of having told the truth before you had received assurance of it. How then is there in you that charity which rejoices not in iniquity? But be not deceived. Throughout the field, that is, throughout the world, there will be found the wheat of the Lord growing till the end of the world. Christ has said this: Christ is truth. Let charity be in you, and let it rejoice in the truth.

The Father decrees, the Word executes, and the Son is manifested, through whom the Father is believed on. The economy[fn-37-P3777_1202749:259-nf] of harmony is led back to one God; for God is One.

Let not my neighbor be angry if he be set forth to us by a thing without soul and without feeling. The Lord Himself, even our Saviour Jesus Christ, is called the corner-stone, to build up two in Himself.

Then, to strengthen the accusation against them he holds the whole of their idolatry up to ridicule. For in the first place the changing even were a very fit subject of scorn. But to change to such things too, is beyond all excuse. For what then did they change it, and what was it which they invested with His Glory? Some conceptions they ought to have had about Him, as, for instance, that He is God, that He is Lord of all, that He made them, which were not, that He exerciseth a Providence, that He careth for them. For these things are the \"Glory of God.\" To whom then did they ascribe it? Not even to men, but \"to an image made like to corruptible man.\" Neither did they stop here, but even dropped down to the brutes, or rather to the images of these. But consider, I pray, the wisdom of Paul, how he has taken the two extremes, God the Highest, and creeping things the lowest: or rather, not the creeping things, but the images of these; that he might clearly show their evident madness. For what knowledge they ought to have had concerning Him Who is incomparably more excellent than all, with that they invested what was incomparably more worthless than all. But what has this to do with the philosophers? a man may say. To these belongs most of all what I have said to do with them. For they have the Egyptians who were the inventors of these things to their masters. And Plato, who is thought more reverend than the rest of them, glories in these masters. (Plat. Tim. 21. B. etc.) And his master is in a stupid awe of these idols, for he it is that bids them sacrifice the cock to Aesculapius[fn-20-P2050_2047108:5-nf] (his last words, Phaedo), where (i.e. in his temple. So Field from Mss.) are the images of these beasts, and creeping things. And one may see Apollo and Bacchus worshipped along with these creeping things. And some of the philosophers even lifted up to Heaven bulls, and scorpions, and dragons, and all the rest of that vanity. For in all parts did the devil zealously strive to bring men down before the images of creeping things, and to range beneath the most senseless of all things, him whom God hath willed to lift up above the heavens. And it is not from this only, but also from other grounds, that you will see their chief man to come under the remarks now made.

Then, to strengthen the accusation against them he holds the whole of their idolatry up to ridicule. For in the first place the changing even were a very fit subject of scorn. But to change to such things too, is beyond all excuse. For what then did they change it, and what was it which they invested with His Glory? Some conceptions they ought to have had about Him, as, for instance, that He is God, that He is Lord of all, that He made them, which were not, that He exerciseth a Providence, that He careth for them. For these things are the \"Glory of God.\" To whom then did they ascribe it? Not even to men, but \"to an image made like to corruptible man.\" Neither did they stop here, but even dropped down to the brutes, or rather to the images of these. But consider, I pray, the wisdom of Paul, how he has taken the two extremes, God the Highest, and creeping things the lowest: or rather, not the creeping things, but the images of these; that he might clearly show their evident madness. For what knowledge they ought to have had concerning Him Who is incomparably more excellent than all, with that they invested what was incomparably more worthless than all. But what has this to do with the philosophers? a man may say. To these belongs most of all what I have said to do with them. For they have the Egyptians who were the inventors of these things to their masters. And Plato, who is thought more reverend than the rest of them, glories in these masters. (Plat. Tim. 21. B. etc.) And his master is in a stupid awe of these idols, for he it is that bids them sacrifice the cock to Aesculapius[fn-20-P2050_2047108:5-nf] (his last words, Phaedo), where (i.e. in his temple. So Field from Mss.) are the images of these beasts, and creeping things. And one may see Apollo and Bacchus worshipped along with these creeping things. And some of the philosophers even lifted up to Heaven bulls, and scorpions, and dragons, and all the rest of that vanity. For in all parts did the devil zealously strive to bring men down before the images of creeping things, and to range beneath the most senseless of all things, him whom God hath willed to lift up above the heavens. And it is not from this only, but also from other grounds, that you will see their chief man to come under the remarks now made. For having made a collection of the poets, and having said that we should believe them upon matters relating to God, as having accurate knowledge, he has nothing else to bring forward but the \"linked sweetness\" of these absurdities, and then says, that this utterly ludicrous trifling is to be held for true.[fn-20-P2051_2048823:6-nf] [fn-20-P2052_2050273:7-nf] ","title":"Homily III.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":4,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_55_sermon_xxxviii_lxxxviii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"21.

For having come out, some of them from the worship of idols, and others from the senate, or from the first civil offices, for the sake of the miserable exemption[fn-51-P5164_2028730:65-nf] from duty and for the patronage they gained, and having bribed[fn-51-P5165_2028814:66-nf] the Meletians who preceded them, they have been advanced to this dignity even before they had been under instruction, And even if they pretended to have been such, yet what kind of instruction is to be obtained among the Meletians? But indeed without even pretending to be under instruction, they came at once, and immediately were called Bishops, just as children receive a name. Being then persons of this description, they thought the thing of no great consequence, nor even supposed that piety was different from impiety. Accordingly from being Meletians they readily and speedily became Arians; and if the Emperor should command them to adopt any other profession, they are ready to change again to that also. Their ignorance of true godliness quickly brings them to submit to the prevailing folly, and that which happens to be first taught them. For it is nothing to them to be carried about by every wind[fn-51-P5166_2029753:67-nf] and tempest, so long as they are only exempt from duty, and obtain the patronage of men; nor would they scruple probably to change again[fn-51-P5167_2029912:68-nf] to what they were before, even to become such as they were when they were heathens. Any how, being men of such an easy temper, and considering the Church as a civil senate, and like heathen being idolatrously minded, they put on the honourable name[fn-51-P5168_2030182:69-nf] of the Saviour, under which they polluted the whole of Egypt, by causing so much as the name of the Arian heresy to be known therein. For Egypt has heretofore been the only country, throughout which the profession of the orthodox faith was boldly maintained[fn-51-P5169_2030462:70-nf] ; and therefore these misbelievers have striven to introduce jealousy there also, or rather not they, but the devil who has stirred them up, in order that when his herald Antichrist shall come, he may find that the Churches in Egypt also are his own, and that the Meletians have already been instructed in his principles, and may recognise himself as already formed[fn-51-P5170_2030851:71-nf] in them.","title":"Part VIII.","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":4,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_73_xxi_the_first_conference_of_abbot_theonas_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"47","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Wherefore we ought to know that we from whom the requirements of the law are no longer exacted, but in whose ears the word of the gospel daily sounds: \"If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell all that thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come follow Me,\"[fn-63-P6323_2256609:13-nf] when we offer to God tithes of our substance, are still in a way ground down beneath the burden of the law, and not able to rise to those heights of the gospel, those who conform to which are recompensed not only by blessings in this present life, but also by future rewards. For the law promises to those who obey it no rewards of the kingdom of heaven, but only solaces in this life, saying: \"The man that doeth these things shall live in them.\"[fn-63-P6324_2257080:14-nf] But the Lord says to His disciples: \"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven;\" and: \"Everyone that leaveth house or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or field for My name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life.\"[fn-63-P6325_2257396:15-nf] And this with good reason. For it is not so praiseworthy for us to abstain from forbidden as from lawful things, and not to use these last out of reverence for Him, Who has permitted us to use them because of our weakness. And so if even those who, faithfully offering tithes of their fruits, are obedient to the more ancient precepts of the Lord, cannot yet climb the heights of the gospel, you can see very clearly how far short of it those fall who do not even do this. For how can those men be partakers of the grace of the gospel who disregard the fulfilment even of the lighter commands of the law, to the easy character of which the weighty words of the giver of the law bear testimony, as a curse is actually invoked on those who do not fulfil them; for it says: \"Cursed is everyone that does not continue in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them.\"[fn-63-P6326_2258307:16-nf] But here on account of the superiority and excellence of the commandments it is said: \"He that can receive it, let him receive it.\"[fn-63-P6327_2258461:17-nf] There the forcible compulsion of the lawgiver shows the easy character of the precepts; for he says: \"I call heaven and earth to record against you this day, that if ye do not keep the commandments of the Lord your God ye shall perish from off the face of the earth.\"[fn-63-P6328_2258752:18-nf] Here the grandeur of sublime commands is shown by the very fact that He does not order, but exhorts, saying: \"if thou wilt be perfect go\" and do this or that. There Moses lays a burden that cannot be refused on those who are unwilling: here Paul meets with counsels those who are willing and eager for perfection. For that was not to be enjoined as a general charge, nor to be required, if I may so say, as a regular rule from all, which could not be secured by all, owing to its wonderful and lofty nature; but by counsels all are rather stimulated to grace, that those who are great may deservedly be crowned by the perfection of their virtues, while those who are small, and not able to come up to \"the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ,\"[fn-63-P6329_2259527:19-nf] although they seem to be lost to sight and hidden as it were by the brightness of larger stars, may yet be free from the darkness of the curses which are in the law, and not adjudged to suffer present evils or visited with eternal punishment. Christ therefore does not constrain anyone, by the compulsion of a command, to those lofty heights of goodness, but stimulates them by the power of free will, and urges them on by wise counsels and the desire of perfection. For where there is a command, there is duty, and consequently punishment. But those who keep those things to which they are driven by the severity of the law established escape the punishment with which they were threatened, instead of obtaining rewards and a recompense.","title":"XXI.

This then I consider the sense of this passage, and that, a very ecclesiastical sense[fn-55-P5589_2216936:248-nf] . However, there is another way in which one might remark upon it, giving the same sense in a parallel way; viz. that, though it does not speak of the exaltation of the Word Himself, so far as He is Word[fn-55-P5590_2217207:249-nf] (for He is, as was just now said, most high and like His Father), yet by reason of His becoming man it indicates His resurrection from the dead. For after saying, `He hath humbled Himself even unto death,' He immediately added, `Wherefore He hath highly exalted Him;' wishing to shew, that, although as man He is said to have died, yet, as being Life, He was exalted on the resurrection; for `He who descended, is the same also who rose again[fn-55-P5591_2217671:250-nf] .' He descended in body, and He rose again because He was God Himself in the body. And this again is the reason why according to this meaning he brought in the conjunction `Wherefore;' not as a reward of virtue nor of advancement, but to signify the cause why the resurrection took place; and why, while all other men from Adam down to this time have died and remained dead, He only rose in integrity from the dead. The cause is this, which He Himself has already taught us, that, being God, He has become man. For all other men, being merely born of Adam, died, and death reigned over them; but He, the Second Man, is from heaven, for `the Word was made flesh[fn-55-P5592_2218376:251-nf] ,' and this Man is said to be from heaven and heavenly[fn-55-P5593_2218450:252-nf] , because the Word descended from heaven; wherefore He was not held under death. For though He humbled Himself, yielding His own Body to come unto death, in that it was capable of death[fn-55-P5594_2218659:253-nf] , yet He was highly exalted from earth, because He was God's Son in a body. Accordingly what is here said, `Wherefore God also hath highly exalted Him,' answers to Peter's words in the Acts, `Whom God raised up, having loosed the bonds of death, because it was not possible that He should be holden of it[fn-55-P5595_2220186:254-nf] .' For as Paul has written, `Since being in form of God He became man, and humbled Himself unto death, therefore God also hath highly exalted Him,' so also Peter says, `Since, being God, He became man, and signs and wonders proved Him to beholders to be God, therefore it was not possible that He should be holden of death.' To alan it was not possible to succeed in this; for death belongs to man; wherefore, the Word, being God, became flesh, that, being put to death in the flesh, He might quicken all men by His own power.","title":"Discourse I","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":4,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"72","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"46.

And so, since certain brethren in a not unjustifiable fear have hesitated to perform the rites of the Lord's mystery, at a synodal meeting, as we have said, we have received a formal request for advice on this matter, and in carefully discussing it, we have desired to weigh each members opinion, and to handle it in so cautious a manner as to arrive with certainty at the truth by making use of the knowledge of many. Consequently the same things, which have come into our mind by the Divine inspiration, have received the assent and confirmation of a large number of the brethren.

For who is so given over to suspicions as to decide that to be true which without any evidence he suspects by mere guesswork? And so wherever the man himself who is anxious for the new birth does not recollect his baptism, and no one can Bear witness about him being unaware of his consecration to God, there is no possibility for sin to creep In, seeing that, so far as their knowledge goes, neither the bestower or receiver of the consecration is guilty.

Why should I question whether what God has said is true, since I ought not to doubt that what God says is true. \"No man,\" He says, \"hath ascended into heaven, save He who came down from heaven, even the Son of man, who is in heaven.\" Certainly the Word of the Father was ever in heaven: and how did He assert that the Son ofman was ever in heaven? You are then to understand that He showed that He who was ever the Son of God was also the Son of man: when lie asserted that He, who had but recently appeared as the Son of man, was ever in heaven. To this points still mere that other passage in which He testifies that the same Son of man; viz., the Word of God who, as He said, came down from heaven, even at the time when He was speaking on earth, was in heaven. For \"no man,\" He said, \"hath ascended into heaven, save He who came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven.\" Who, I pray you, is this who is speaking? Assuredly it is Christ. But where was He at the moment when He spoke? Assuredly on earth. And how can He assert that He came down from heaven when He was born, and that He was in heaven when He was speaking, or say that He is the same Son of man, when certainly no one but God can come down from heaven, and when He speaks on earth, and certainly cannot be in heaven except through the Infinite nature of God? Consider then this at last, and note that the Son of man is the same Person as the Word of God: for He is the Son of man since He is truly born of man, and the Word of God, since He who speaks on earth abideth ever in heaven. And so when He truly terms Himself the Son of man, it refers to His human birth, while the fact that He never departs from heaven, refers to the Infinite character of His Divine nature. And so the Apostle's teaching is admirably in accordance with those sacred words:(\"for He that descended,\" says He, \"is the same that ascended also above all heavens, that He might fill all things,\"[fn-71-P7113_2591955:18-nf] ) when He says that He that descended is the same that ascended. But none can descend from heaven except the Word of God: who certainly \"being in the form of God, emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross.\"[fn-71-P7114_2592339:19-nf] Thus the Word of God descended from heaven: but the Son of man ascended. But He says that the same Person ascended and descended. Thus you see that the Son of man is the same Person as the Word of God.","title":"Book IV.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":4,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_82_book_iv_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"47","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"\"The labour,\" says he, \"of Egypt, and the merchandize of Ethiopia, and the Sabaeans, men of stature shall come over to thee.\" No one can doubt that in these names of different nations is signified the coming of the nations who were to believe. But you cannot deny that the nations have come over to Christ, for since the name of Christianity has arisen, they have come over to the Lord Jesus Christ not only in faith but actually in name. For since they are called what they really are, that which was the work of faith becomes the token by which they are named. \"They shall,\" he says, \"come over to thee and shall be thine: they shall walk after thee bound with manacles.\" As there are chains of coercion, so too there are chains of love, as the Lord says: \"I drew them with chains of love.\"[fn-71-P7145_2605487:30-nf] For indeed great are these chains, and chains of ineffable love, for those who are bound with them rejoice in their fetters. Do you want to know whether this is true? Hear how the Apostle Paul exults and rejoices in his chains, when he says: \"I therefore a prisoner in the Lord beseech you.\"[fn-71-P7146_2605796:31-nf] And again: \"I beseech thee, whereas thou art such an one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Jesus Christ.\"[fn-71-P7147_2605936:32-nf] You see how he rejoiced in the dignity of his chains, by the example of which he actually stirred up others. But there can be no doubt that where there is single-minded love of the Lord, there is also single-minded delight in chains worn for the Lord's sake: as it is written: \"But the multitude of the believers was of one heart and one soul.\"[fn-71-P7148_2606299:33-nf] \"And they shall worship thee,\" he says, \"and shall make supplication to thee: for in thee is God, and there is no God beside thee.\" The Apostle clearly explains the prophet's words, when he says that \"God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself.\"[fn-71-P7149_2606573:34-nf] \"In Thee then,\" he says, \"is God and there is no God beside thee.\" When the prophet says \"In Thee is God,\" most admirably does he point not merely to Him who was visible, but to Him who was in what was visible, distinguishing the indweller from Him in whom He dwelt, by pointing out the two natures, not by denying the unity(of Person).

He took upon Him for our sakes what was not His due, that He might deliver us from what was due to us. Death was not due to Him, nor life to us. Why? Because we were sinners. Death was not due to Him, nor life to us; He received what was not due to Him, He gave what was not due to us. But since we are speaking of the remission of sins, lest ye should think it too high a thing to imitate Christ, hear the Apostle saying, \"Forgiving one another, even as God in Christ hath forgiven you.\"[fn-56-P5665_2397224:5-nf] Be ye therefore imitators of God.\" They are the Apostle's words, not mine. Is it indeed a proud thing to imitate God?

You have been the first to step into the arena of true religion; you have beaten off many an attack in bouts with the heretics; you have borne the strong hot wind[fn-52-P5293_1656163:4-nf] of trial, both you who are leaders of the Church, to whom has been the ministry of the altar, and every individual of the laity, including those of higher rank.

It is for this reason that you are too strong for the attack of your assailants, and allow no hold to your antagonists in any one of your members, wherefore day and night I pray the King of the ages to preserve the people in the integrity of their faith, and for them to preserve the clergy, like a head unharmed at the top, exercising its own watchful forethought for every portion of the body underneath. For while the eyes discharge their functions, the hands can do their work as they ought, the feet can move without tripping, and no part of the body is deprived of due care. I beseech you, then, to cling to one another, as you are doing and as you will do. I beseech you who are entrusted with the care of souls to keep each and all together, and to cherish them like beloved children. I beseech the people to continue to show you the respect and honour due to fathers, that in the goodly order of your Church you may keep your strength and the foundation of your faith in Christ; that God's name may be glorified and the good gift of love increase and abound. May I, as I hear of you, rejoice in your progress in God. If I am still bidden to sojourn in the flesh in this world, may I one day see you in the peace of God.

But of course this is not the real cause of our separation. It was when they found that they would recommend themselves to Euzoius[fn-53-P5372_1692909:7-nf] if they were alienated from me, that they devised these pretences. The object was to find some ground of recommendation with the authorities for their attack upon me. Now they are beginning to run down even the Nicene Creed, and nickname me Homoousiast, because in that creed the Only begotten Son is said to be homoousios with God the Father. Not that one essence is divided into two kindred parts; God forbid! This was not the meaning of that holy and God-beloved synod; their meaning was that what the Father is in essence, such is the Son. And thus they themselves have explained it to us, in the phrase Light of Light. Now it is the Nicene Creed, brought by themselves from the west, which they presented to the Synod at Tyana, by which they were received.[fn-53-P5373_1693694:8-nf] But they have an ingenious theory as to changes of this kind; they use the words of the creed as physicians use a remedy for the particular moment, and substitute now one and now another to suit particular diseases.

Ask what the novelty is. I confess what I have received, that the Paraclete is ranked with Father and Son, and not numbered with created beings. We have made profession of our faith in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and we are baptized in the name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Wherefore we never separate the Spirit from conjunction[fn-53-P5376_1694882:11-nf] with the Father and the Son. For our mind, enlightened by the Spirit, looks at the Son, and in Him, as in an image, beholds the Father. And I do not invent names of myself, but call the Holy Ghost Paraclete; nor do I consent to destroy His due glory. These are truly my doctrines. If any one wishes to accuse me for them, let him accuse me; let my persecutor persecute me.

The right reverend bishop Meletius was the first to speak boldly for the truth, and fought that good fight in the days of Constantine, Therefore my Church has felt strong affection towards him, for the sake of that brave and firm stand, and has held communion with him. I, therefore, by God's grace, have held him to be in communion up to this time; and, if God will, I shall continue to do so. Moreover the very blessed Pope Athanasius came from Alexandria, and was most anxious that communion should be established between Meletius and himself; but by the malice of counsellors their conjunction was put off to another season. Would that this had not been so! I have never accepted communion with any one of those who have since been introduced into the see, not because I count them unworthy, but because I see no ground for the condemnation of Meletius. Nevertheless I have heard many things about tile brethren, without giving heed to them, because the accused were not brought face to face with their accusers, according to that which is written, \"Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?\"[fn-58-P5832_1831641:9-nf] I cannot therefore at present write to them, right honourable brother, and I ought not to be forced to do so. It will be becoming to your peaceful disposition not to cause union in one direction and disunion in another, but to restore the severed member to the original union. First, then, pray; next, to the utmost of your ability, exhort, that ambition may be driven from their hearts, and that reconciliation may be effected between them both to restore strength to the Church, and to destroy the rage of oar foes. It has given great comfort to my soul that, in addition to your other right and accurate statements in theology, you should acknowledge the necessity of stating that the hypostases are three. Let the brethren at Antioch be instructed by you after this manner. Indeed I am confident that they have been so instructed; for I am sure you would never have accepted communion with them unless you had carefully made sure of this point in them.","title":"Letter CCLVIII.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":4,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_282_letter_cclxiv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"2","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"To Barses, bishop of Edessa, in exile.[fn-59-P5941_1871081:2-nf] ","title":"Letter CCLXIV.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":4,"verse":27,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_353_letter_cccxli_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"You have not yet ceased to be offended with me, and so I tremble as I write.
