{"verses":["And when they were gone, Judith went into her oratory:  and putting\non haircloth, laid ashes on her head:  and falling down prostrate before\nthe Lord, she cried to the Lord, saying:","Lord God of my father Simeon, who gavest him a sword to execute\nvengeance against strangers, who had defiled by their uncleanness, and\nuncovered the virgin unto confusion:","And who gavest their wives to be made a prey, and their daughters\ninto captivity:  and all their spoils to be divided to the servants, who\nwere zealous with thy zeal:  assist, I beseech thee, O Lord God, me a\nwidow.","For thou hast done the things of old, and hast devised one thing\nafter another:  and what thou hast designed hath been done.","For all thy ways are prepared, and in thy providence thou hast\nplaced thy judgments.","Look upon the camp of the Assyrians now, as thou wast pleased to\nlook upon the camp of the Egyptians, when they pursued armed after thy\nservants, trusting in their chariots, and in their horsemen, and in a\nmultitude of warriors.","But thou lookedst over their camp, and darkness wearied them.","The deep held their feet, and the waters overwhelmed them.","So may it be with these also, O Lord, who trust in their\nmultitude, and in their chariots, and in their pikes, and in their\nshields, and in their arrows, and glory in their spears,","And know not that thou art our God, who destroyest wars from the\nbeginning, and the Lord is thy name.","Lift up thy arm as from the beginning, and crush their power with\nthy power:  let their power fall in their wrath, who promise themselves\nto violate thy sanctuary, and defile the dwelling place of thy name,\nand to beat down with their sword the horn of thy altar.","Bring to pass, O Lord, that his pride may be cut off with his own\nsword.","Let him be caught in the net of his own eyes in my regard, and do\nthou strike him by the graces of the words of my lips.","Give me constancy in my mind, that I may despise him:  and\nfortitude that I may overthrow him.","For this will be a glorious monument for thy name, when he shall\nfall by the hand of a woman.","For thy power, O Lord, is not in a multitude, nor is thy pleasure\nin the strength of horses, nor from the beginning have the proud been\nacceptable to thee:  but the prayer of the humble and the meek hath\nalways pleased thee.","O God of the heavens, creator of the waters, and Lord of the\nwhole creation, hear me a poor wretch, making supplication to thee, and\npresuming of thy mercy.","Remember, O Lord, thy covenant, and put thou words in my mouth,\nand strengthen the resolution in my heart, that thy house may continue\nin thy holiness:","And all nations may acknowledge that thou art God, and there is\nno other besides thee."]}
