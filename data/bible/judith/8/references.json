If it is the things which hold an intermediate place between virtue and vice, such as poverty, disease, obscurity, and humble birth, and the like, these things civil laws hold forth, and are: praised for so doing. And those of the Peripatetic school, who introduce three kinds of good things, and think that their opposites are evil, this opinion suits. But the law given to us enjoins us to shun what are in reality bad things-adultery, uncleanness, paederasty, ignorance, wickedness, soul-disease, death (not that which severs the soul from the body, but that which severs the soul from truth). For these are vices in reality, and the workings that proceed from them are dreadful and terrible. \"For not unjustly,\" say the divine oracles, \"are the nets spread for birds; for they who are accomplices in blood treasure up evils to themselves.\"[fn-57-P5742_1742017:75-nf] How, then, is the law still said to be not good by certain heresies that clamorously appeal to the apostle, who says, \"For by the law is the knowledge of sin? \"[fn-57-P5743_1742300:76-nf] To whom we say, The law did not cause, but showed sin. For, enjoining what is to be done, it reprehended what ought not to be done. And it is the part of the good to teach what is salutary, and to point out what is deleterious; and to counsel the practice of the one, and to command to shun the other. Now the apostle, whom they do not comprehend, said that by the law the knowledge of sin was manifested, not that from it it derived its existence. And how can the law be not good, which trains, which is given as the instructor (paidagwgo/j) to Christ,[fn-57-P5744_1742873:77-nf] that being corrected by fear, in the way of discipline, in order to the attainment of the perfection which is by Christ? \"I will not,\" it is said, \"the death of the sinner, as his repentance.\"[fn-57-P5745_1743085:78-nf] Now the commandment works repentance; in as much as it deters[fn-57-P5746_1743185:79-nf] from what ought not to be done, and enjoins good deeds. By ignorance he means, in my opinion, death. \"And he that is near the Lord is full of stripes.\"[fn-57-P5747_1743540:80-nf] Plainly, he, that draws near to knowledge, has the benefit of perils, fears, troubles, afflictions, by reason of his desire for the truth. \"For the son who is instructed turns out wise, and an intelligent son is saved from burning. And an intelligent son will receive the commandments.\"[fn-57-P5748_1743849:81-nf] And Barnabas the apostle having said, \"Woe to those who are wise in their own conceits, clever in their own eyes,\"[fn-57-P5749_1743987:82-nf] added, \"Let us become spiritual, a perfect temple to God; let us, as far as in us lies, practise the fear of God, and strive to keep His commands, that we may rejoice in His judgments.\"[fn-57-P5750_1744190:83-nf] Whence \"the fear of God\" is divinely said to be the beginning of wisdom.[fn-57-P5751_1744293:84-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"}]
