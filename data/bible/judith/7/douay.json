{"verses":["But Holofernes on the next day gave orders to his army, to go up\nagainst Bethulia.","Now there were in his troops a hundred and twenty thousand\nfootmen, and two and twenty thousand horsemen, besides the preparations\nof those men who had been taken, and who had been brought away out of\nthe provinces and cities of all the youth.","All these prepared themselves together to fight against the\nchildren of Israel, and they came by the hillside to the top, which\nlooketh toward Dothain, from the place which is called Belma, unto\nChelmon, which is over against Esdrelon.","But the children of Israel, when they saw the multitude of them,\nprostrated themselves upon the ground, putting ashes upon their heads,\npraying with one accord, that the God of Israel would shew his mercy\nupon his people.","And taking their arms of war, they posted themselves at the\nplaces, which by a narrow pathway lead directly between the mountains,\nand they guarded them all day and night.","Now Holofernes, in going round about, found that the fountain\nwhich supplied them with water, ran through an aqueduct without the\ncity on the south side:  and he commanded their aqueduct to be cut off.","Nevertheless there were springs not far from the walls, out of\nwhich they were seen secretly to draw water, to refresh themselves a\nlittle rather than to drink their fill.","But the children of Ammon and Moab came to Holofernes, saying:  The\nchildren of Israel trust not in their spears, nor in their arrows, but\nthe mountains are their defence, and the steep hills and precipices\nguard them.","Wherefore that thou mayst overcome them without joining battle,\nset guards at the springs that they may not draw water out of them, and\nthou shalt destroy them without sword, or at least being wearied out\nthey will yield up their city, which they suppose, because it is\nsituate in the mountains, to be impregnable.","And these words pleased Holofernes, and his officers, and he\nplaced all round about a hundred men at every spring.","And when they had kept this watch for full twenty days, the\ncisterns, and the reserve of waters failed among all the inhabitants of\nBethulia, so that there was not within the city, enough to satisfy\nthem, no not for one day, for water was daily given out to the people\nby measure.","Then all the men and women, young men, and children, gathering\nthemselves together to Ozias, all together with one voice,","Said:  God be judge between us and thee, for thou hast done evil\nagainst us, in that thou wouldst not speak peaceably with the\nAssyrians, and for this cause God hath sold us into their hands.","And therefore there is no one to help us, while we are cast down\nbefore their eyes in thirst, and sad destruction.","And now assemble ye all that are in the city, that we may of our\nown accord yield ourselves all up to the people of Holofernes.","For it is better, that being captives we should live and bless\nthe Lord, than that we should die, and be a reproach to all flesh,\nafter we have seen our wives and our infants die before our eyes.","We call to witness this day heaven and earth, and the God of our\nfathers, who taketh vengeance upon us according to our sins, conjuring\nyou to deliver now the city into the hand of the army of Holofernes,\nthat our end may be short by the edge of the sword, which is made\nlonger by the drought of thirst.","And when they had said these things, there was great weeping and\nlamentation of all in the assembly, and for many hours with one voice\nthey cried to God, saying:","We have sinned with our fathers, we have done unjustly, we have\ncommitted iniquity:","Have thou mercy on us, because thou art good, or punish our\niniquities by chastising us thyself, and deliver not them that trust in\nthee to a people that knoweth not thee,","That they may not say among the Gentiles:  Where is their God?","And when being wearied with these cries, and tired with these\nweepings, they held their peace,","Ozias rising up all in tears, said:  Be of good courage, my\nbrethren, and let us wait these five days for mercy from the Lord.","For perhaps he will put a stop to his indignation, and will give\nglory to his own name.","But if after five days be past there come no aid, we will do the\nthings which you have spoken."]}
