But in order to learn the dispositions of ripe widowhood, run through the course of the Scriptures. From the time when her husband died she laid aside the garments of mirth, and took those of mourning. Every day she was intent on fasting except on the Sabbath and the Lord's Day and the times of holy days, not as yielding to desire of refreshment, but out of respect for religion. For this is that which is said: \"Whether ye eat or drink, all is to be done in the name of Jesus Christ,\"[fn-74-P7446_1927965:47-nf] that even the very refreshment of the body is to have respect to the worship of holy religion. So then, holy Judith,[fn-74-P7447_1928101:48-nf] strengthened by lengthened mourning and by daily fasting, sought not the enjoyments of the world regardless of danger, and strong in her contempt for death. In order to accomplish her stratagem she put on that robe of mirth, wherewith in her husband's lifetime she was wont to be clothed, as though she would give pleasure to her husband, if she freed her country. But she saw another man whom she was seeking to please, even Him, of Whom it is said: \"After me cometh a Man Who is preferred before me.\"[fn-74-P7448_1928625:49-nf] And she did well in resuming her bridal ornaments when about to fight, for the reminders of wedlock are the arms of chastity, and in no other way could a widow please or gain the victory.","title":"The Treatise Concerning Widows.","author":"St. Ambrose"}]
