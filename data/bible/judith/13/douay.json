And\nwhen all had held their peace,","Judith said:  Praise ye the Lord our God, who hath not forsaken\nthem that hope in him.","And by me his handmaid he hath fulfilled his mercy, which he\npromised to the house of Israel:  and he hath killed the enemy of his\npeople by my hand this night.","Then she brought forth the head of Holofernes out of the wallet,\nand shewed it them, saying:  Behold the head of Holofernes the general\nof the army of the Assyrians, and behold his canopy, wherein he lay in\nhis drunkenness, where the Lord our God slew him by the hand of a\nwoman.","But as the same Lord liveth, his angel hath been my keeper both\ngoing hence, and abiding there, and returning from thence hither:  and\nthe Lord hath not suffered me his handmaid to be defiled, but hath\nbrought me back to you without pollution of sin, rejoicing for his\nvictory, for my escape, and for your deliverance.","Give all of you glory to him, because he is good, because his\nmercy endureth for ever.","And they all adored the Lord, and said to her:  The Lord hath\nblessed thee by his power, because by thee he hath brought our enemies\nto nought.","And Ozias the prince of the people of Israel, said to her:\nBlessed art thou, O daughter, by the Lord the most high God, above all\nwomen upon the earth.","Blessed be the Lord who made heaven and earth, who hath directed\nthee to the cutting off the head of the prince of our enemies.","Because he hath so magnified thy name this day, that thy praise\nshall not depart out of the mouth of men who shall be mindful of the\npower of the Lord for ever, for that thou hast not spared thy life, by\nreason of the distress and tribulation of thy people, but hast\nprevented our ruin in the presence of our God.","And all the people said:  So be it, so be it.","And Achior being called for came, and Judith said to him:  The\nGod of Israel, to whom thou gavest testimony, that he revengeth himself\nof his enemies, he hath cut off the head of all the unbelievers this\nnight by my hand.","And that thou mayst find that it is so, behold the head of\nHolofernes, who in the contempt of his pride despised the God of\nIsrael:  and threatened them with death, saying:  When the people of\nIsrael shall be taken, I will command thy sides to be pierced with a\nsword.","Then Achior seeing the head of Holofernes, being seized with a\ngreat fear he fell on his face upon the earth, and his soul swooned\naway.","But after he had recovered his spirits he fell down at her feet,\nand reverenced her, and said:","Blessed art thou by thy God in every tabernacle of Jacob, for in\nevery nation which shall hear thy name, the God of Israel shall be\nmagnified on occasion of thee."]}
