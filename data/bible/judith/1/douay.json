But on the square of them, each side was extended\nthe space of twenty feet.","And he made the gates thereof according to the height of the\ntowers:","And he gloried as a mighty one in the force of his army and in the\nglory of his chariots.","Now in the twelfth year of his reign, Nabuchodonosor king of the\nAssyrians, who reigned in Ninive the great city, fought against\nArphaxad and overcame him,","In the great plain which is called Ragua, about the Euphrates, and\nthe Tigris, and the Jadason, in the plain of Erioch the king of the\nElicians.","Then was the kingdom of Nabuchodonosor exalted, and his heart was\nelevated:  and he sent to all that dwelt in Cilicia and Damascus, and\nLibanus,","And to the nations that are in Carmelus, and Cedar, and to the\ninhabitants of Galilee in the great plain of Asdrelon,","And to all that were in Samaria, and beyond the river Jordan even\nto Jerusalem, and all the land of Jesse till you come to the borders of\nEthiopia.","To all these Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians, sent\nmessengers:","But they all with one mind refused, and sent them back empty, and\nrejected them without honour.","Then king Nabuchodonosor being angry against all that land, swore\nby his throne and kingdom that he would revenge himself of all those\ncountries."]}
