{"verses":["And Judith said to all the people:  Hear me, my brethren, hang ye\nup this head upon our walls.","And as soon as the sun shall rise, let every man take his arms,\nand rush ye out, not as going down beneath, but as making an assault.","Then the watchmen must needs run to awake their prince for the\nbattle.","And when the captains of them shall run to the tent of\nHolofernes, and shall find him without his head wallowing in his blood,\nfear shall fall upon them.","And when you shall know that they are fleeing, go after them\nsecurely, for the Lord will destroy them under your feet.","Then Achior seeing the power that the God of Israel had wrought,\nleaving the religion of the Gentiles, he believed God, and circumcised\nthe flesh of his foreskin, and was joined to the people of Israel, with\nall the succession of his kindred until this present day.","And immediately at break of day, they hung up the head of\nHolofernes upon the walls, and every man took his arms, and they went\nout with a great noise and shouting.","And the watchmen seeing this, ran to the tent of Holofernes.","And they that were in the tent came, and made a noise, before the\ndoor of the chamber to awake him, endeavouring by art to break his\nrest, that Holofernes might awake, not by their calling him, but by\ntheir noise.","For no man durst knock, or open and go into the chamber of the\ngeneral of the Assyrians.","But when his captains and tribunes were come, and all the chiefs\nof the army of the king of the Assyrians, they said to the\nchamberlains:","Go in, and awake him, for the mice, coming out of their holes,\nhave presumed to challenge us to fight.","Then Vagao going into his chamber, stood before the curtain, and\nmade a clapping with his hands:  for he thought that he was sleeping\nwith Judith.","But when with hearkening, he perceived no motion of one lying,\nhe came near to the curtain, and lifting it up, and seeing the body of\nHolofernes, lying upon the ground, without the head, weltering in his\nblood, he cried out with a loud voice, with weeping, and rent his\ngarments.","And he went into the tent of Judith, and not finding her, he ran\nout to the people,","And said:  One Hebrew woman hath made confusion in the house of\nking Nabuchodonosor:  for behold Holofernes lieth upon the ground, and\nhis head is not upon him.","Now when the chiefs of the army of the Assyrians had heard this,\nthey all rent their garments, and an intolerable fear and dread fell\nupon them, and their minds were troubled exceedingly.","And there was a very great cry in the midst of their camp."]}
