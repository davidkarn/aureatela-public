{"verses":["And it came to pass when they had left off speaking, that\nHolofernes being in a violent passion, said to Achior:","Because thou hast prophesied unto us, saying:  That the nation of\nIsrael is defended by their God, to shew thee that there is no God, but\nNabuchodonosor:","When we shall slay them all as one man, then thou also shalt die\nwith them by the sword of the Assyrians, and all Israel shall perish\nwith thee:","And thou shalt find that Nabuchodonosor is lord of the whole\nearth:  and then the sword of my soldiers shall pass through thy sides,\nand thou shalt be stabbed and fall among the wounded of Israel, and\nthou shalt breathe no more till thou be destroyed with them.","But if thou think thy prophecy true, let not thy countenance sink,\nand let the paleness that is in thy face, depart from thee, if thou\nimaginest these my words cannot be accomplished.","And that thou mayst know that thou shalt experience these things\ntogether with them, behold from this hour thou shalt be associated to\ntheir people, that when they shall receive the punishment they deserve\nfrom my sword, thou mayst fall under the same vengeance.","Then Holofernes commanded his servants to take Achior, and to lead\nhim to Bethulia, and to deliver him into the hands of the children of\nIsrael.","And the servants of Holofernes taking him, went through the\nplains:  but when they came near the mountains, the slingers came out\nagainst them.","Then turning out of the way by the side of the mountain, they tied\nAchior to a tree hand and foot, and so left him bound with ropes, and\nreturned to their master.","And the children of Israel coming down from Bethulia, came to\nhim, and loosing him they brought him to Bethulia, and setting him in\nthe midst of the people, asked him what was the matter that the\nAssyrians had left him bound.","In those days the rulers there, were Ozias the son of Micha of\nthe tribe of Simeon, and Charmi, called also Gothoniel.","And Achior related in the midst of the ancients, and in the\npresence of all the people, all that he had said being asked by\nHolofernes:  and how the people of Holofernes would have killed him for\nthis word,","And how Holofernes himself being angry had commanded him to be\ndelivered for this cause to the Israelites:  that when he should\novercome the children of Israel, then he might command Achior also\nhimself to be put to death by diverse torments, for having said:  The\nGod of heaven is their defender.","And when Achior had declared all these things, all the people\nfell upon their faces, adoring the Lord, and all of them together\nmourning and weeping poured out their prayers with one accord to the\nLord,","Saying:  O Lord God of heaven and earth, behold their pride, and\nlook on our low condition, and have regard to the face of thy saints,\nand shew that thou forsakest not them that trust on thee, and that thou\nhumblest them that presume of themselves, and glory in their own\nstrength.","So when their weeping was ended, and the people's prayer, in\nwhich they continued all the day, was concluded, they comforted Achior,","Saying:  The God of our fathers, whose power thou hast set forth,\nwill make this return to thee, that thou rather shalt see their\ndestruction.","And when the Lord our God shall give this liberty to his\nservants, let God be with thee also in the midst of us:  that as it\nshall please thee, so thou with all thine mayst converse with us.","Then Ozias, after the assembly was broken up, received him into\nhis house, and made him a great supper.","And all the ancients were invited, and they refreshed themselves\ntogether after their fast was over.","And afterwards all the people were called together, and they\nprayed all the night long within the church, desiring help of the God\nof Israel."]}
