Else, if of all blasphemy it has been said, \"By your means My Name is blasphemed,\"[fn-7-P751_311084:101-nf] we all perish at once; since the whole circus, with no desert of ours, assails \"the Name\" with wicked suffrages. Let us cease (to be Christians) and it will not be blasphemed! On the contrary, while we are, let it be blasphemed: in the observance, not the overstepping, of discipline; while we are being approved, not while we are being reprobated. Oh blasphemy, bordering on martyrdom, which now attests me to be a Christian,[fn-7-P752_311585:102-nf] while for that very account it detests me! The cursing of well-maintained Discipline is a blessing of the Name. \"If,\" says he, \"I wished to please men, I should not be Christ's servant.\"[fn-7-P753_311909:103-nf] But the same apostle elsewhere bids us take care to please all: \"As I,\" he says, \"please all by all means.\"[fn-7-P754_312046:104-nf] No doubt he used to please them by celebrating the Saturnalia and New-year's day! [Was it so] or was it by moderation and patience? by gravity, by kindness, by integrity? In like manner, when he is saying, \"I have become all things to all, that I may gain all,\"[fn-7-P755_312332:105-nf] does he mean \"to idolaters an idolater? \"\"to heathens a heathen? \"\"to the worldly worldly? \"But albeit he does not prohibit us from having our conversation with idolaters and adulterers, and the other criminals, saying, \"Otherwise ye would go out from the world,\"[fn-7-P756_312618:106-nf] of course he does not so slacken those reins of conversation that, since it is necessary for us both to live and to mingle with sinners, we may be able to sin with them too. Where there is the intercourse of life, which the apostle concedes, there is sinning, which no one permits. To live with heathens is lawful, to die with them[fn-7-P757_312972:107-nf] is not. Let us live with all;[fn-7-P758_313069:108-nf] let us be glad with them, out of community of nature, not of superstition. We are peers in soul, not in discipline; fellow-possessors of the world, not of error. But if we have no right of communion in matters of this kind with strangers, how far more wicked to celebrate them among brethren! Who can maintain or defend this? The Holy Spirit upbraids the Jews with their holy-days. \"Your Sabbaths, and new moons, and ceremonies,\" says He, \"My soul hateth.\"[fn-7-P759_313635:109-nf] By us, to whom Sabbaths are strange,[fn-7-P760_313696:110-nf] and the new moons and festivals formerly beloved by God, the Saturnalia and New-year's and Midwinter's festivals and Matronalia are frequented-presents come and go-New-year's gifts-games join their noise-banquets join their din! Oh better fidelity of the nations to their own sect, which claims no solemnity of the Christians for itself! Not the Lord's day, not Pentecost, even it they had known them, would they have shared with us; for they would fear lest they should seem to be Christians. We are not apprehensive lest we seem to be heathens! If any indulgence is to be granted to the flesh, you have it.

In reference to this we are fitly warned against inquisitiveness to correct which is the great function of temperance. Thus it is said, \"Take heed lest any one seduce you by philosophy.\" And because the word philosophy originally means the love and pursuit of wisdom, a thing of great value and to be sought with the whole mind, the apostles, with great prudence, that he might not be thought to deter from the love of wisdom, has added the words, \"And the elements of this world.\"[fn-4-P443_196350:59-nf] For some people, neglecting virtues, and ignorant of what God is, and of the majesty of nature which remains always the same, think that they are engaged in an important business when searching with the greatest inquisitiveness and eagerness into this material mass which we call the world. This begets so much pride, that they look upon themselves as inhabitants of the heaven of which they often discourse. The soul, then, which purposes to keep itself chaste for God must refrain from the desire of vain knowledge like this. For this desire usually produces delusion, so that the soul thinks that nothing exists but what is material; or if, from regard to authority, it confesses that there is an immaterial existence, it can think of it only under material images, and has no belief regarding it but that imposed by the bodily sense.

Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more[fn-4-P455_143027:154-nf] than these cometh of evil.\" The righteousness of the Pharisees is not to forswear oneself; and this is confirmed by Him who gives the command not to swear, so far as relates to the righteousness of the kingdom of heaven. For just as he who does not speak at all cannot speak falsely, so he who does not swear at all cannot swear falsely. But yet, since he who takes God to witness swears, this section must be carefully considered, lest the apostle should seem to have acted contrary to the Lord's precept, who often swore in this way, when he says, \"Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God I lie not;\"[fn-4-P456_143686:155-nf] and again, \"The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.\"[fn-4-P457_143818:156-nf] Of like nature also is that asseveration, \"For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of His Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers.\"[fn-4-P458_144026:157-nf] Unless, perchance, one were to say that it is to be reckoned swearing only when something is spoken of by which one swears; so that he has not used an oath, because he has not said, by God; but has said, \"God is witness.\" It is ridiculous to think so; yet because of the contentious, or those very slow of apprehension, lest any one should think there is a difference, let him know that the apostle has used an oath in this way also, saying, \"By your rejoicing, I die daily.\"[fn-4-P459_144520:158-nf] And let no one think that this is so expressed as if it were said, Your rejoicing makes me die daily; just as it is said, By his teaching he became learned, i.e. by his teaching it came about that he was perfectly instructed:the Greek copies decide the matter, where we find it written, Nh thn kauxhsin umeteran, an expression which is used only by one taking an oath. Thus, then, it is understood that the Lordgave the command not to swear in this sense, lest any one should eagerly seek after an oath as a good thing, and by the constant use of oaths sink down through force of habit into perjury. And therefore let him who understands that swearing is to be reckoned not among things that are good, but among things that are necessary, refrain as far as he can from indulgingin it, unless by necessity, when he sees men slow to believe what it is useful for them to believe,except they be assured by an oath. To this, accordingly, reference is made when it is said, \"Let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay;\" this is good, and what is to be desired. \"For whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil;\" i.e., if you are compelled to swear, know that it comes of a necessity arising from the infirmity of those whom you are trying to persuade of something; which infirmity is certainly an evil, from which we daily pray to be delivered, when we say, \"Deliver us from evil.\"[fn-4-P460_145916:159-nf] Hence He has not said, Whatsoever is more than these is evil; for you are not doing what is evil when you make a good use of an oath, which, although not in itself good, is yet necessary in order to persuade another that you are trying to move him for some useful end; but it \"cometh of evil\" on his part by whose infirmity you are compelled to swear.[fn-4-P461_146289:160-nf] But no one learns, unless he has had experience, how difficult it is both to get rid of a habit of swearing, and never to do rashly what necessity sometimes compels him to do.[fn-4-P462_146701:161-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"314","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"5.

Do not wish to seem very devout nor more humble than need be, lest you seek glory by shunning it.

From the other disturbing influences which make men rejoice, despond, hope, and fear I find many free; but this is a defect which few are without, and he is best whose character, like a fair skin, is disfigured by the fewest blemishes. I do not think it necessary to warn you against boasting of your riches, or against priding yourself on your birth, or against setting yourself up as superior to others.

It would be time wasted to write to you about it; for there is no greater folly than to teach a pupil what he knows already. But now that you have despised the boastfulness of the world, do not let the fact inspire you with new boastfulness. Harbor not the secret thought that having ceased to court attention in garments of gold you may begin to do so in mean attire. And when you come into a room full of brothers and sisters, do not sit in too low a place or plead that you are unworthy of a footstool. Do not deliberately lower your voice as though worn out with fasting; nor, leaning on the shoulder of another, mimic the tottering gait of one who is faint. Some women, it is true, disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast.[fn-8-P843_171260:557-nf] As soon as they catch sight of any one they groan, they look down; they cover up their faces, all but one eye, which they keep free to see with.

Of these the psalm is sung daily: \"The Lord will scatter the bones of them that please themselves.\"[fn-8-P844_171673:558-nf] Others change their garb and assume the mien of men, being ashamed of being what they were born to be-women.

But as it is seeing I frankly admit him to be wrong, I may read him on the same terms as I read others, because if he is wrong so also are they.

Therefore he was both right in saying that he did not please men, because in that very thing he aimed at pleasing God: and right in authoritatively teaching that we ought to please men, not in order that this should be sought for as the reward of our good deeds; but because the man who would not offer himself for imitation to those whom he wished to be saved, could not please God; but no man possibly can imitate one who has not pleased him. As, therefore, that man would not speak absurdly who should say, In this work of seeking a ship, it is not a ship, but my native country, that I seek: so the apostle also might fitly say, In this work of pleasing men, it is not men, but God, that I please; because I do not aim at pleasing men, but have it as my object, that those whom I wish to be saved may imitate me.

It is burdened with much repetition; subjects, especially, which have been treated in books ii. and iii. are discussed again at great length in later books[fn-2-P225_158313:89-nf] . The frequent stress laid upon the infinity of God, the limitations of human speech and knowledge, the consequent incompleteness of the argument from analogy, the humility necessary when dealing with infinities apparently opposed[fn-2-P226_158610:90-nf] , though it adds to the solemnity of the writer's tone and was doubtless necessary when the work was published in parts, becomes somewhat tedious in the course of a continuous reading. And something must here be said of the peculiarities of style. We saw that in places, as for instance in the beginning of the De Trinitate, Hilary can rise to a singularly lofty eloquence. This eloquence is not merely the unstudied utterance of an earnest faith, but the expression given to it by one whom natural talent and careful training had made a master of literary form. Yet, since his training was that of an age whose standard of taste was far from classical purity, much that must have seemed to him and to his contemporaries to be admirably effective can excite no admiration now. He prays, at the end of the first book, that his diction may be worthy of his theme, and doubtless his effort was as sincere as his prayer. Had there been less effort, there would certainly, in the judgment of a modern reader, have been more success. But he could not foresee the future, and ingenious affectations such as occur at the end of book viii. § I, impietati insolenti, et insolentiae vaniloquae, et vaniloquio seducenti, with the jingle of rhymes which follows, are too frequent for our taste in his pages[fn-2-P227_159962:91-nf] , Sometimes we find purple patches which remind us of the rhetoric of Apuleius[fn-2-P228_160097:92-nf] ; sometimes an excessive display of symmetry and antithesis, which suggests to us St. Cyprian at his worst. Yet Cyprian had the excuse that all his writings are short occasional papers written for immediate effect; neither he, nor any Latin Christian before Hilary, had ventured to construct a great treatise of theology, intended to influence future ages as well as the present. Another excessive development of rhetoric is the abuse of apostrophe, which Hilary sometimes rides almost to death, as in his addresses to the Fisherman, St. John, in the second book[fn-2-P229_160680:93-nf] . These blemishes, however, do not seriously affect his intelligibility. He has earned, in this as in greater matters, an unhappy reputation for obscurity, which he has, to a certain extent, deserved. His other writings, even the Commentary on St. Matthew, are free from the involved language which sometimes makes the De Trinitate hard to understand, and often hard to read with pleasure. When Hilary was appealing to the Emperor, or addressing his own flock, as in the Homilies on the Psalms, he has command of a style which is always clear, stately on occasion, never weak or bald; in these cases he resisted, or did not feel, the temptation to use the resources of his rhetoric. These, unfortunately, had for then result the production of sentences which are often marvels of grammatical contortion and elliptical ingenuity. Yet such sentences, though numerous, are of few and uniform types. In Hilary's case, as in that of Tertullian, familiarity makes the reader so accustomed to them that he instinctively expects their recurrence; and, at their worst, they are never actual breaches of the laws of the language. A translator can hardly be an impartial judge in this matter, for constantly, in passages where the sense is perfectly clear, the ingenuity with which words and constructions are arranged makes it almost impossible to render their meaning in idiomatic terms. One can translate him out of Latin, but not into English. In this he resembles one of the many styles of St. Augustine. There are passages in the De Trinitate, for instance viii. 27, 28, which it would seem thatAugustine had deliberately imitated; a course natural enough in the case of one who was deeply indebted to his predecessor's thought, and must have looked with reverence upon the great pioneer of systematic theology in the Latin tongue. But this involution of style, irritating as it sometimes is, has the compensating advantage that it keeps the reader constantly on the alert. He cannot skim these pages in the comfortable delusion that he is following the course of thought without an effort.","title":"Introduction","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":226,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_05_prolegomena","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"110","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"The Origenist bishops of Syria and Asia Minor had in the years 269-272, after several efforts, succeeded in deposing Paul of Samosata from the See of Antioch.

It was counted a departure from Lucian's principles if a pupil held that the Son was the `perfect Image of the Father's Essence' (Philost. ii. 15); Origen's formula, `distinct in hypostasis, but one in will,' was apparently exploited in a Samosatene sense to express the relation of the Son to the Father. The only two points in fact in which Lucian appears to have modified the system of Paul were, firstly in hypostatising the Logos, which to Paul was an impersonal divine power, secondly in abandoning Paul's purely human doctrine of the historical Christ. To Lucian, the Logos assumed a body (or rather 'Deus sapientiam suam misit in hunc mundum carne vestitam, ubi infra, p. 6), but itself took the place of a soul[fn-3-P313_137514:27-nf] ; hence all the tapeinai leceij of the Gospels applied to the Logos as such, and the inferiority and essential difference of the Son from the Father rigidly followed.","title":"Prolegomena","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_101_note_by_the_american_editor_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"2","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Here may be noted the historic fact that this terrible epoch of persecutions had driven many to the deserts, where they dwelt as hermits.[fn-44-P4467_1354308:64-nf] It now introduced monasticism, in its earliest and least objectionable forms, into Egypt, whence it soon spread into the Church at large.

This reign of death is only destroyed in any man by the Saviour's grace, which wrought even in the saints of the olden time, all of whom, though previous to the coming of Christ in the flesh, yet lived in relation to His assisting grace, not to the letter of the law, which only knew how to command, but not to help them. In the Old Testament, indeed, that was hidden (conformably to the perfectly just dispensation of the times) which is now revealed in the New Testament.

Grow in the ability to distinguish good from evil, and cleave more and more to the Mediator, who delivers you from evil; which does not admit of a local separation from you, but rather of being healed within you.

For therefore it was that the blessed apostle, in addressing those who appeared to him already perfect, even after calling himself imperfect, said, \"Let us, therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.\" And that they might not rush into the hands of seducers, whose desire would be to turn them away from the faith by promising them the knowledge of the truth, and suppose such to be the meaning of the apostle's words, \"God shall reveal even this unto you,\" he forthwith added, \"Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule.\"[fn-32-P3263_1820952:19-nf] If, then, thou hast come to some understanding of what is not at variance with the rule of the Catholic faith, whereto thou hast attained as the way that is guiding thee to thy fatherland; and hast so understood it as to feel it a duty to dismiss all doubts whatever on the subject: add to the building, but do not abandon the foundation.

And not only ought you to avoid the babbling seducers of the mind, who prate away at their fables and falsehoods, and in such vanities make the promise, forsooth, of profound science contrary to the rule of faith, which we have accepted as Catholic; but avoid those also as a still more insidious pest than the others, who discuss truthfully enough the immutability of the divine nature, or the incorporeal creature, or the Creator, and fully prove what they affirm by the most conclusive documents and reasonings, and yet attempt to turn you away from the one Mediator between God and men.

Augustin replied: Well, in answer to your own questions, you tell us first that you believe the gospel, and next, that you do not believe in the birth of Christ; and your reason is, that the birth of Christ is not in the gospel.

You use the word, not as the apostle teaches, but as suits your own errors. What the apostles call the gospel you depart from; for you do not believe that Christ was of the seed of David. This was Paul's gospel; and it was also the gospel of the other apostles, and of all faithful stewards of so great a mystery. For Paul says elsewhere, \"Whether, therefore, I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.\"[fn-11-P1160_603924:3-nf] They did not all write the gospel, but they all preached it.

The word gospel means good news, and might be used of any good news, but is properly applied to the narrative of the Saviour. If, then, you teach something different, you must have departed from the gospel.

But now this glory is being extinguished, and that by means of those who ought with all the more constancy to refuse concession of any pardon to defilements of this kind, that they make the fear of succumbing to adultery and fornication their reason for marrying as often as they please-since \"better it is to marry than to burn.\"[fn-12-P1298_355891:14-nf] No doubt it is for continence sake that incontinence is necessary-the \"burning\" will be extinguished by \"fires!\" Why, then, do they withal grant indulgence, under the name of repentance, to crimes for which they furnish remedies by their law of multinuptialism? For remedies will be idle while crimes are indulged, and crimes will remain if remedies are idle. And so, either way, they trifle with solicitude and negligence; by taking emptiest precaution against (crimes) to which they grant quarter, and granting absurdest quarter to (crimes) against which they take precaution: whereas either precaution is not to be taken where quarter is given, or quarter not given where precaution is taken; for they take precaution, as if they were unwilling that something should be committed; but grant indulgence, as if they were willing it should be committed: whereas, if they be unwilling it should be committed, they ought not to grant indulgence; if they be willing to grant indulgence, they ought not to take precaution. For, again, adultery and fornication will not be ranked at the same time among the moderate and among the greatest sins, so that each course may be equally open with regard to them-the solicitude which takes precaution, and the security which grants indulgence. But since they are such as to hold the culminating place among crimes, there is no room at once for their indulgence as if they were moderate, and for their precaution as if they were greatest But by us precaution is thus also taken against the greatest, or, (if you will), highest (crimes, viz.,) in that it is not permitted, after believing, to know even a second marriage, differentiated though it be, to be sure, from the work of adultery and fornication by the nuptial and dotal tablets: and accordingly, with the utmost strictness, we excommunicate digamists, as bringing infamy upon the Paraclete by the irregularity of their discipline.

You dwell so exclusively upon the subject of the body, harping upon it in your discourse, repeating first the body, and secondly the body, and again the body, and nine times over the body, that you do not even once name the flesh; whereas they always speak of the flesh, but say nothing of the body. I would have you know that we see through what you craftily add, and with wise precaution seek to conceal. For you make use of the same passages to prove the reality of the resurrection by means of which Origen denies it; you support questionable positions with doubtful arguments, and thus raise a storm which in a moment overthrows the settled fabric of faith.

You intend to confess the resurrection of the flesh, you say, in a real and not an imaginary sense. After the remarks with which you smooth things over to the ears of the ignorant, to the effect that we rise again with the very bodies with which we died and were buried, why do you not go on and speak thus: \"The Lord after His resurrection showed the prints of the nails in His hands, pointed to the wound of the spear in His side, and when the Apostles doubted because they thought they saw a phantom, gave them reply,[fn-70-P7095_2337355:67-nf] `Handle Me and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and blood as ye see Me have'; and specially to Thomas,[fn-70-P7096_2337478:68-nf] `Put thy finger into My hands, and thy hand into My side, and be not faithless, but believing.' Similarly after the resurrection we shall have the same members which we now use, the same flesh and blood and bones, for it is not the nature of these which is condemned in Holy Scripture, but their works. Then again, it is written in Genesis:[fn-70-P7097_2337837:69-nf] `My Spirit shall not abide in those men, because they are flesh.' And the Apostle Paul, speaking of the corrupt doctrine and works of the Jews, says:[fn-70-P7098_2338004:70-nf] `I rested not in flesh and blood.' And to the Saints, who, of course, were in the flesh, he says:[fn-70-P7099_2338119:71-nf] `But ye are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if the Spirit of God dwells in you.'

For if all were of the same mind as your present advisers, how would you have become a Christian, since there would be no bishops? Or if our successors are to inherit this state of mind, how will the Churches be able to hold together? Or do your advisers think that you have received nothing, that they despise it? If so surely they are wrong. For it is time for them to think that the grace of the Font is nothing, if some are found to despise it. But you have received it, beloved Dracontius; do not tolerate your advisers nor deceive yourself. For this will be required of you by the God who gave it. Have you not heard the Apostle say, `Neglect not the gift that is in thee[fn-98-P9843_3516232:11-nf] ?' or have you not read how he accepts the man that had doubled his money, while he condemned the one that had hidden it? But may it come to pass that you may quickly return, in order that you too may be one of those who are praised. Or tell me, whom do your advisers wish you to imitate? For we ought to walk by the standard of the saints and the fathers, and imitate them, and to be sure that if we depart from them we put ourselves also out of their fellowship. Whom then do they wish you to imitate? The one who hesitated, and while wishing to follow, delayed it and took counsel because of his family[fn-98-P9844_3516858:12-nf] , or blessed Paul, who, the moment the stewardship was entrusted to him, `straightway conferred not with flesh and blood[fn-98-P9845_3516997:13-nf] ?' For although he said, `I am not worthy to be called an Apostle[fn-98-P9846_3517080:14-nf] ,' yet, knowing what he had received, and being not ignorant of the giver, he wrote, `For woe is me if I preach not the gospel[fn-98-P9847_3517226:15-nf] .' But, as it was `woe to me' if he did not preach, so, in teaching and preaching the gospel, he had his converts as his joy and crown[fn-98-P9848_3517378:16-nf] . This explains why the saint[fn-98-P9849_3517427:17-nf] was zealous to preach as far as Illyricum, and not to shrink from proceeding to Rome[fn-98-P9850_3517555:18-nf] , or even going as far as the Spains[fn-98-P9851_3517609:19-nf] , in order that the more he laboured, he might receive so much the greater reward for his labour. He boasted then that he had fought the good fight, and was confident that he should receive the great crown[fn-98-P9852_3517836:20-nf] . Therefore, beloved Dracontius, whom are you imitating in your present action? Paul, or men unlike him? For my part, I pray that you, and myself, may prove an imitator of all the saints.","title":"Letter XLIX. Letter to Dracontius .

Why with dressed hair, as if she either had or sought for a husband?

For well do I know that even from the few things that have been said you will embrace it with much zeal. But since it is also necessary to make clear and manifest the apostolic saying which has been to-day read; seeming as it does to many to afford a pretext for indolence; so that some may not, providing for themselves hence a certain frigid defence, neglect their own salvation-to this let us direct our discourse. What then is this saying? \"Whether in pretence,\" it says, \"or in sincerity,[fn-8-P840_555507:12-nf] Christ is preached.\"[fn-8-P841_555590:13-nf] This many wrest absolutely[fn-8-P842_555638:14-nf] and just as happens, without reading what precedes and what comes after it; but having cut it off from the sequence of the remaining members, to the destruction of their own soul they put it forward to the more indolent. For attempting to seduce them from the sound faith; then seeing them afraid and trembling; on the ground of its not being without danger to do this,[fn-8-P843_556065:15-nf] and desiring to relieve their fears, they bring forward this apostolic declaration, saying, Paul conceded this, by saying, \"Whether in pretence or in sincerity, let Christ be proclaimed.\" But these things are not (true), they are not. For in the first place he did not say \"let him be proclaimed,\" but \"he is proclaimed,\" and the difference between this and that is wide. For the saying \"let him be proclaimed\" belongs to a lawgiver; but the saying \"he is proclaimed\" to one announcing the event. For that Paul does not ordain a law that there should be heresies, but draws away all who attended to him, hear what he says, \"If any one preaches to you a gospel besides what ye have received, let him be anathema, were it even I, were it even an angel from the heavens.\"[fn-8-P844_556958:16-nf] Now he would not have anamethized both himself and an angel, if he had known the act to be without danger. And again- \"I am jealous of you with a jealousy of God,\" he says; \"for I have betrothed you to one husband a chaste virgin: and fear lest at some time, as the serpent beguiled Eve by his wiliness, so your thoughts should be corrupted from the singleness that is towards Christ.\"[fn-8-P845_557364:17-nf] See, he both set down singleness, and granted no allowance. For if there were allowance, there was no danger: and if there was no danger Paul would not have feared: and Christ would not also have commanded that the tares should be burned up, if it were a thing indifferent to attend to this one or that or another: or to all indiscriminately[fn-8-P846_557900:18-nf] ","title":"Concerning Lowliness of Mind.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_18_book_xi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"25","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"23.

Now they adduce the case of Peter himself, and the others, who were pillars of the apostolate, as having been blamed by Paul for not walking uprightly, according to the truth of the gospel-that very Paul indeed, who, being yet in the mere rudiments of grace, and trembling, in short, lest he should have run or were still running in vain, then for the first time held intercourse with those who were apostles before himself. Therefore because, in the eagerness of his zeal against Judaism as a neophyte, he thought that there was something to be blamed in their conduct-even the promiscuousness of their conversation[fn-41-P4102_1341067:235-nf] -but afterwards was himself to become in his practice all things to all men, that he might gain all,-to the Jews, as a Jew, and to them that were under the law, as under the law,-you would have his censure, which was merely directed against conduct destined to become acceptable even to their accuser, suspected of prevarication against God on a point of public doctrine.[fn-41-P4103_1341475:236-nf] Touching their public doctrine, however, they had, as we have already said, joined hands in perfect concord, and had agreed also in the division of their labour in their fellowship of the gospel, as they had indeed in all other respects:[fn-41-P4104_1341775:237-nf] \"Whether it were I or they, so we preach.\"[fn-41-P4105_1341835:238-nf] When, again, he mentioned \"certain false brethren as having crept in unawares,\" who wished to remove the Galatians into another gospel,[fn-41-P4106_1341992:239-nf] he himself shows that that adulteration of the gospel was not meant to transfer them to the faith of another god and christ, but rather to perpetuate the teaching of the law; because he blames them for maintaining circumcision, and observing times, and days, and months, and years, according to those Jewish ceremonies which they ought to have known were now abrogated, according to the new dispensation purposed by the Creator Himself, who of old foretold this very thing by His prophets. Thus He says by Isaiah: Old things have passed away. \"Behold, I will do a new thing.\"[fn-41-P4107_1342604:240-nf] And in another passage: \"I will make a new covenant, not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt.\"[fn-41-P4108_1342790:241-nf] In like manner by Jeremiah: Make to yourselves a new covenant, \"circumcise yourselves to the Lord, and take away the foreskins of your heart.\"[fn-41-P4109_1342988:242-nf] It is this circumcision, therefore, and this renewal, which the apostle insisted on, when he forbade those ancient ceremonies concerning which their very founder announced that they were one day to cease; thus by Hosea: \"I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast-days, her new moons, and her Sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.\"[fn-41-P4110_1343347:243-nf] So likewise by Isaiah: \"The new moons, and Sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; your holy days, and fasts, and feast-days, my soul hateth.\"[fn-41-P4111_1343527:244-nf] Now, if even the Creator had so long before discarded all these things, and the apostle was now proclaiming them to be worthy of renunciation, the very agreement of the apostle's meaning with the decrees of the Creator proves that none other God was preached by the apostle than He whose purposes he now wished to have recognised, branding as false both apostles and brethren, for the express reason that they were pushing back the gospel of Christ the Creator from the new condition which the Creator had foretold, to the old one which He had discarded.","title":"Book I.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_21_dialogue_iii_the_impassible_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"437","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Orth.-Did the great Paul call the divine James the Lord's brother?[fn-49-P4945_1200534:91-nf] ","title":"Dialogue III.-The Impassible.","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":1,"verse":33,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_22_book_iv_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"41","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"At the time that Cyril administered the church of Jerusalem after Maximus, the sign of the cross appeared in the heavens.

If believers are to throw away all the books which have led them to believe, I see no reason why they should continue reading the Gospel itself. The Gospel, too, must be worthless to this inquirer, who, according to Faustus' pitiful supposition, rejects with ridicule the authority of Christ. And to the believer it must be superfluous, if true notices of Christ are superfluous to believers. And if the Gospel should be read by the believer, that he may not forget what he has believed, so should the prophets, that he may not forget why he believed. For if he forgets this his faith cannot be firm. By this principle, you should throw away the books of Manichaeus, on the authority of which you already believe that light-that is, God-fought with darkness, and that, in order to bind darkness, the light was first swallowed up and bound, and polluted and mangled by darkness, to be restored, and liberated, and purified, and healed by your eating, for which you are rewarded by not being condemned to the mass of darkness for ever, along with that part of the light which cannot be extricated. This fiction is sufficiently published by your practice and your words. Why do you seek for the testimony of books, and add to the embarrassment of your God by the consumption of strength in the needless task of writing manuscripts? Burn all your parchments, with their finely-ornamented binding; so you will be rid of a useless burden, and your God who suffers confinement in the volume will be set free. What a mercy it would be to the members of your God, if you could boil your books and eat them! There might be a difficulty, however, from the prohibition of animal food. Then the writing must share in the impurity of the sheepskin. Indeed, you are to blame for this, for, like what you say was done in the first war between light and darkness, you brought what was clean in the pen in contact with the uncleanness of the parchment. Or perhaps, for the sake of the colors, we may put it the other way; and so the darkness would be yours, in the ink which you brought against the light of the white pages. If these remarks irritate you, you should rather be angry with yourselves for believing doctrines of which these are the necessary consequences. As for the books of the apostles and prophets, we read them as a record of our faith, to encourage our hope and animate our love. These books are in perfect harmony with one another; and their harmony, like the music of a heavenly trumpet, wakens us from the torpor of worldliness, and urges us on to the prize of our high calling. The apostle, after quoting from the prophets the words, \"The reproaches of them that reproached Thee fell on me,\" goes on to speak of the benefit of reading the prophets: \"For whatsoever things were written beforetime were written for our learning; that we, through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, might have hope.\"[fn-15-P1569_855494:36-nf] If Faustus denies this, we can only say with Paul, \"If any one shall preach to you another doctrine than that ye have received, let him be accursed.\"[fn-15-P1570_855661:37-nf] ","title":"Book XIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_30_the_epistle_of_ignatius_to_hero_a_deacon_of_antioch","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"ANF-01","text":"Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to Hero, the deacon of Christ, and the servant of God, a man honoured by God, and most dearly loved as well as esteemed, who carries Christ and the Spirit within him, and who is mine own son in faith and love: Grace, mercy, and peace from Almighty God, and from Christ Jesus our Lord, His only-begotten Son, \"who gave Himself for our sins, that He might deliver us from the present evil world,\"[fn-27-P2785_452185:1-nf] and preserve us unto His heavenly kingdom.","title":"The Epistle of Ignatius to Hero, a Deacon of Antioch","author":"Ignatius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_114_tractate_cix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"4.

I say that my Gospel is the true one; Marcion, that his is. I affirm that Marcion's Gospel is adulterated; Marcion, that mine is. Now what is to settle the point for us, except it be that principle[fn-53-P5326_1656094:83-nf] of time, which rules that the authority lies with that which shall be found to be more ancient; and assumes as an elemental truth,[fn-53-P5327_1656237:84-nf] that corruption (of doctrine) belongs to the side which shall be convicted of comparative lateness in its origin.[fn-53-P5328_1656370:85-nf] For, inasmuch as error[fn-53-P5329_1656549:86-nf] is falsification of truth, it must needs be that truth therefore precede error. A thing must exist prior to its suffering any casualty;[fn-53-P5330_1656698:87-nf] and an object[fn-53-P5331_1656727:88-nf] must precede all rivalry to itself. Else how absurd it would be, that, when we have proved our position to be the older one, and Marcion's the later, ours should yet appear to be the false one, before it had even received from truth its objective existence;[fn-53-P5332_1656999:89-nf] and Marcion's should also be supposed to have experienced rivalry at our hands, even before its publication; and, in fine, that that should be thought to be the truer position which is the later one-a century[fn-53-P5333_1657235:90-nf] later than the publication of all the many and great facts and records of the Christian religion, which certainly could not have been published without, that is to say, before, the truth of the gospel. With regard, then, to the pending[fn-53-P5334_1657490:91-nf] question, of Luke's Gospel (so far as its being the common property[fn-53-P5335_1657572:92-nf] of ourselves and Marcion enables it to be decisive of the truth,[fn-53-P5336_1657657:93-nf] ) that portion of it which we alone receive[fn-53-P5337_1657729:94-nf] is so much older than Marcion, that Marcion, himself once believed it, when in the first warmth of faith he contributed money to the Catholic church, which along with himself was afterwards rejected,[fn-53-P5338_1657984:95-nf] when he fell away from our truth into his own heresy. What if the Marcionites have denied that he held the primitive faith amongst ourselves, in the face even of his own letter? What, if they do not acknowledge the letter? They, at any rate, receive his Antitheses; and more than that, they make ostentatious use[fn-53-P5339_1658337:96-nf] of them. Proof out of these is enough for me. For if the Gospel, said to be Luke's which is current amongst us[fn-53-P5340_1658465:97-nf] (we shall see whether it be also current with Marcion), is the very one which, as Marcion argues in his Antitheses, was interpolated by the defenders of Judaism, for the purpose of such a conglomeration with it of the law and the prophets as should enable them out of it to fashion their Christ, surely he could not have so argued about it, unless he had found it (in such a form). No one censures things before they exist,[fn-53-P5341_1658905:98-nf] when he knows not whether they will come to pass. Emendation never precedes the fault. To be sure,[fn-53-P5342_1659022:99-nf] an amender of that Gospel, which had been all topsy-turvy[fn-53-P5343_1659092:100-nf] from the days of Tiberius to those of Antoninus, first presented himself in Marcion alone-so long looked for by Christ, who was all along regretting that he had been in so great a hurry to send out his apostles without the support of Marcion! But for all that,[fn-53-P5344_1659368:101-nf] heresy, which is for ever mending the Gospels, and corrupting them in the act, is an affair of man's audacity, not of God's authority; and if Marcion be even a disciple, he is yet not \"above his master; \"[fn-53-P5345_1659591:102-nf] if Marcion be an apostle, still as Paul says, \"Whether it be I or they, so we preach; \"[fn-53-P5346_1659699:103-nf] if Marcion be a prophet, even \"the spirits of the prophets will be subject to the prophets,\"[fn-53-P5347_1659814:104-nf] for they are not the authors of confusion, but of peace; or if Marcion be actually an angel, he must rather be designated \"as anathema than as a preacher of the gospel,\"[fn-53-P5348_1660007:105-nf] because it is a strange gospel which he has preached. So that, whilst he amends, he only confirms both positions: both that our Gospel is the prior one, for he amends that which he has previously fallen in with; and that that is the later one, which, by putting it together out of the emendations of ours, he has made his own Gospel, and a novel one too.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_27_homily_xx_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"\"And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him.\"[fn-8-P898_801448:12-nf] (v. 23.)

Augustin replied: What amazing folly, to disbelieve what Matthew records of Christ, while you believe Manichaeus! If Matthew is not to be believed because he was not present when Christ said, \"I came not to destroy the law and the prophets, but to fulfill,\" was Manichaeus present, was he even born, when Christ appeared among men? According, then, to your rule, you should not believe anything that Manichaeus says of Christ. On the other hand, we refuse to believe what Manichaeus says of Christ; not because he was not present as a witness of Christ's words and actions, but because he contradicts Christ's disciples, and the Gospel which rests on their authority. The apostle, speaking in the Holy Spirit, tells us that such teachers would arise. With reference to such, he says to believers: \"If any man preaches to you another gospel than that ye have received, let him be accursed.\"[fn-17-P1765_998078:3-nf] If no one can say what is true of Christ unless he has himself seen and heard Him, no one now can be trusted. But if believers can now say what is true of Christ because the truth has been handed down in word or writing by those who saw and heard, why might not Matthew have heard the truth from his fellow-disciple John, if John was present and he himself was not, as from the writings of John both we who are born so long after and those who shall be born after us can learn the truth about Christ? In this way, the Gospels of Luke and Mark, who were companions of the disciples, as well as the Gospel of Matthew, have the same authority as that of John. Besides, the Lord Himself might have told Matthew what those called before him had already been witnesses of. Your idea is, that John should have recorded this saying of the Lord, as he was present on the occasion. As if it might not happen that, since it was impossible to write all that be heard from the Lord, he set himself to write some, omitting this among others. Does he not say at the close of his Gospel: \"And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written\"?[fn-17-P1766_999357:4-nf] This proves that he omitted many things intentionally, But if you choose John as an authority regarding the law and the prophets, I ask you only to believe his testimony to them. It is John who writes that Isaiah saw the glory of Christ.[fn-17-P1767_999612:5-nf] It is in his Gospel we find the text already treated of: \"If ye believed Moses, ye would also believe me; for he wrote of me.\"[fn-17-P1768_999756:6-nf] Your evasions are met on every side.

(There, Paul says,) \"And none of the Apostles saw I; but here, it is said (Barnabas), brought him to the Apostles.\"-Well, then, either (Paul) means, \"I went not up with intent to refer or attach myself to them (anaqesqai)-for what saith he? \"I referred not myself, neither went I to Jerusalem to those who were Apostles before me:\"[fn-9-P913_814818:1-nf] or else, that the laying await for him in Damascus was after his return from Arabia;[fn-9-P914_815959:2-nf] or else, again, that the visit to Jerusalem was after he came from Arabia. Certainly of his own accord he went not to the Apostles, but \"assayed to join himself unto the disciples \"-as being[fn-9-P915_816327:3-nf] a teacher, not a disciple-\" I went not,\" he says, \"for this purpose, that I should go to those who were Apostles before me: certainly, I learnt nothing from them.\" Or,[fn-9-P916_816709:4-nf] he does not speak of this visit, but passes it by, so that the order is, \"I went into Arabia, then I came to Damascus, then to Jerusalem, then to Syria:\" or else, again, that he went up to Jerusalem, then was sent to Damascus, then to Arabia, then again to Damascus, then to Caesarea. Also, the visit \"after fourteen years,\" probably, was when he brought up the [alms to the] brethren together with Barnabas: (Gal. ii. 1) or else he means a different occasion. (Acts xi. 30.) For the Historian for conciseness, often omits incidents, and condenses the times. Observe how unambitious the writer is, and how he does not even relate (related in ch. xxii. 17-21) that vision, but passes it by. \"He assayed,\" it says, \"to join himself to the disciples. And they were afraid of him.\" By this again is shown the ardor of Paul's character: not (only) from the mouth of Ananias, and of those who wondered at him there, but also of those in Jerusalem: \"they believed not that he was a disciple:\" for truly that was beyond all human expectation.[fn-9-P917_818923:5-nf] He[fn-9-P918_820001:6-nf] was no longer a wild beast, but a man mild and gentle! And observe how he does not go to the Apostles, such is his forbearance, but to the disciples, as being a disciple. He was not thought worthy of credit. \"But Barnabas\"-\" Son of Consolation\" is his appellation, whence also he makes himself easy of access to the man: for\"he was a kind man\" (ch. xi. 24), exceedingly, and this is proved both by the present instance, and in the affair of John (Mark)-\" having taken him, brought him to the Apostles, and related to them how he had seen the Lord in the way.\"[fn-9-P919_822073:7-nf] (xv. 39.) It is likely that at Damascus also he had heard all about him: whence he was not afraid but the others were, for he was a man whose glance inspired fear. \"How,\" it says, \"he had seen the Lord in the way, and that He had spoken unto him, and how in Damascus he had spoken boldly in the name of the Lord. And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem, and speaking boldly in the name of Jesus\" (v. 28): these things were demonstrative of the former, and by his acts he made good what was spoken of him. \"And he spake, and disputed with the Hellenists.\" (v. 29.) So then the disciples were afraid of him, and the Apostles did not trust him; by this therefore he relieves them of their fear. \"With the Hellenists:\" he means those who used the Greek tongue: and this he did, very wisely; for those others, those profound Hebrews had no mind even to see him. \"But they,\" it says, \"went about to slay him:\" a token, this, of his energy, and triumphant victory, and of their exceeding annoyance at what had happened. Thereupon, fearing lest the issue should be the same as in the case of Stephen, they sent him to Caesarea. For it says, \"When the brethren were aware of this, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus\" (v. 30), at the same time to preach, and likely to be more in safety, as being in his own country. But observe, I pray you, how far it is from being the case that everything is done by (miraculous) grace; how, on the contrary, God does in many things leave them to manage for themselves by their own wisdom and in a human way; so[fn-9-P920_825183:8-nf] to cut off the excuse of idle people: for if it was so in the case of Paul, much more in theirs.[fn-9-P921_825394:9-nf] \"Then, it says, \"the Church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace (they), being edified, and walking in the fear of the Lord, and abounded in the comfort of the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-9-P922_826466:10-nf] (v. 31.) He is about to relate that Peter goes down (from Jerusalem), therefore that you may not impute this to fear, he first says this. For while there was persecution, he was in Jerusalem, but when the affairs of the Church are everywhere in security, then it is that he leaves Jerusalem. See how fervent and energetic he is! For he did not think, because there was peace, therefore there was no need of his presence. Paul[fn-9-P923_827143:11-nf] departed, and there was peace: there is no war nor disturbance. Them, they respected most, as having often stood by them, and as being held in admiration by the multitude: but him, they despised, and were more savage against him. See, how great a war, and immediately, peace! See what that war effected. It dispersed the peace-makers. In Samaria, Simon was put to shame: in Judea, the affair of Sapphira took place. Not that, because there was peace, therefore matters became relaxed, but such was the peace as also to need exhortation. \"And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.\" (v. 32.) Like the commander of an army, he went about, inspecting the ranks, what part was compact, what in good order, what needed his presence. See how on all occasions he goes about, foremost. When an Apostle was to be chosen, he was the foremost: when the Jews were to be told, that these were \"not drunken,\" when the lame man was to be healed, when harangues to be made, he is before the rest: when the rulers were to be spoken to, he was the man; when Ananias, he (ch. i. 15; ii. 15; iii. 4-12; iv. 8; v. 3-15.): when healings were wrought by the shadow, still it was he. And look: where there was danger, he was the man, and where good[fn-9-P924_829465:12-nf] management (was needed); but where all is calm, there they act all in common, and he demands no greater honor (than the others). When need was to work miracles, he starts forward, and here again he is the man to labor and toil. \"And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy. And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And. he arose immediately.\" (v. 33, 34.) And why did he not wait for the man's faith, and ask if he wished to be healed? In the first place, the miracle served for exhortation to many: hear then how great the gain. \"And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.\" (v. 35.) For the man was notable. \"Arise, and make thy bed:\" he does well to give a proof of the miracle: for they not only released men of their diseases, but in giving the health they gave the strength also. Moreover, at that time they had given no proofs of their power, so that the man could not reasonably have been required to show his faith, as neither in the case of the lame man did they demand it. (ch. iii. 6.) As therefore Christ in the beginning of His miracles did not demand faith, so neither did these. For in Jerusalem indeed, as was but reasonable, the faith of the parties was first shown; \"they brought out their sick into the streets, but as Peter passed by, his shadow at least might fall upon some of them\" (ch. v. 15); for many miracles had been wrought there; but here this is the first that occurs. For of the miracles, some were wrought for the purpose of drawing others (to faith); some for the comfort of them that believed. \"Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and alms-deeds which she did. And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber. And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that be would not delay to come to them.\" (v. 36-38). Why did they wait till she was dead? Why was not Peter solicited (eskulh) before this? So right-minded (filosofountej) were they, they did not think it proper to trouble (skullein) the Disciples about such matters, and to take them away from the preaching: as indeed this is why it mentions that the place was near, seeing[fn-9-P925_832299:13-nf] they asked this as a thing beside his mark, and not now in the regular course. \"Not to delay to come unto them:\" for she was a disciple. And Peter arose, and went with them. And when he was come, they led him into the upper chamber.\" (v. 39.) They do not beseech, but leave it to him to give her life (swthrian.) See[fn-9-P926_833202:14-nf] what a cheering inducement to alms is here! \"And all the widows,\" it says, \"stood round him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them.\" Peter went into the apartment, as one who took it calmly, but see what an accession came of it! It is not without a meaning that the Writer has informed us of the woman's name, but to show that the name she bore (ferwnumoj hn) matched her character; as active and wakeful was she as an antelope. For in many instances there is a Providence in the giving of names, as we have often told you. \"She was full,\" it says, \"of good works:\" not only of alms, but \"of good works,\" first, and then of this good work in particular. \"Which,\" it says, \"Dorcas made while she was with them.\" Great humility! Not as we do; but they were all together in common, and in company with them she made these things and worked. \"But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.\" (v. 40.) Why does he put them all out? That he may not be confused nor disturbed by their weeping. \"And having knelt down, he prayed.\" Observe the intentness of his prayer. \"And[fn-9-P927_835086:15-nf] he gave her his hand.\" (v. 41.) So did Christ to the daughter of Jairus: \"And (says the Evangelist) having taken her by the hand.\" Mark severally, first the life, then the strength brought into her, the one by the word, the other by his hand-\" And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive:\" to some for comfort, because they received back their sister, and because they saw the miracle, and for kindly support (prostasian) to others. \"And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord. And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.\" (v. 42-43.) Mark the unassuming conduct, mark the moderation of Peter, how he does not make his abode with this lady, or some other person of distinction, but with a tanner: by all his acts leading men to humility, neither suffering the mean to be ashamed, nor the great to be elated! \"Many days; \"[fn-9-P928_836325:16-nf] for they needed his instruction, who had believed through the miracles.-Let us look then again at what has been said.","title":"Homily XXI.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":1,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_28_homily_xxi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"One may well be much at a loss here to understand how it is that, whereas in the Epistle to the Galatians Paul says, \"I went not to Jerusalem,\" but \"into Arabia\" and\" to Damascus,\" and, \"After three years I went up to Jerusalem,\" and \"to see Peter\" (Gal. i. 17), (istorhsai Cat.) here the writer says the contrary. (There, Paul says,) \"And none of the Apostles saw I; but here, it is said (Barnabas), brought him to the Apostles.\"-Well, then, either (Paul) means, \"I went not up with intent to refer or attach myself to them (anaqesqai)-for what saith he? \"I referred not myself, neither went I to Jerusalem to those who were Apostles before me:\"[fn-9-P913_814818:1-nf] or else, that the laying await for him in Damascus was after his return from Arabia;[fn-9-P914_815959:2-nf] or else, again, that the visit to Jerusalem was after he came from Arabia. Certainly of his own accord he went not to the Apostles, but \"assayed to join himself unto the disciples \"-as being[fn-9-P915_816327:3-nf] a teacher, not a disciple-\" I went not,\" he says, \"for this purpose, that I should go to those who were Apostles before me: certainly, I learnt nothing from them.\" Or,[fn-9-P916_816709:4-nf] he does not speak of this visit, but passes it by, so that the order is, \"I went into Arabia, then I came to Damascus, then to Jerusalem, then to Syria:\" or else, again, that he went up to Jerusalem, then was sent to Damascus, then to Arabia, then again to Damascus, then to Caesarea. Also, the visit \"after fourteen years,\" probably, was when he brought up the [alms to the] brethren together with Barnabas: (Gal. ii. 1) or else he means a different occasion. (Acts xi. 30.) For the Historian for conciseness, often omits incidents, and condenses the times. Observe how unambitious the writer is, and how he does not even relate (related in ch. xxii. 17-21) that vision, but passes it by. \"He assayed,\" it says, \"to join himself to the disciples. And they were afraid of him.\" By this again is shown the ardor of Paul's character: not (only) from the mouth of Ananias, and of those who wondered at him there, but also of those in Jerusalem: \"they believed not that he was a disciple:\" for truly that was beyond all human expectation.[fn-9-P917_818923:5-nf] He[fn-9-P918_820001:6-nf] was no longer a wild beast, but a man mild and gentle! And observe how he does not go to the Apostles, such is his forbearance, but to the disciples, as being a disciple. He was not thought worthy of credit. \"But Barnabas\"-\" Son of Consolation\" is his appellation, whence also he makes himself easy of access to the man: for\"he was a kind man\" (ch. xi. 24), exceedingly, and this is proved both by the present instance, and in the affair of John (Mark)-\" having taken him, brought him to the Apostles, and related to them how he had seen the Lord in the way.\"[fn-9-P919_822073:7-nf] (xv. 39.) It is likely that at Damascus also he had heard all about him: whence he was not afraid but the others were, for he was a man whose glance inspired fear. \"How,\" it says, \"he had seen the Lord in the way, and that He had spoken unto him, and how in Damascus he had spoken boldly in the name of the Lord. And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem, and speaking boldly in the name of Jesus\" (v. 28): these things were demonstrative of the former, and by his acts he made good what was spoken of him. \"And he spake, and disputed with the Hellenists.\" (v. 29.) So then the disciples were afraid of him, and the Apostles did not trust him; by this therefore he relieves them of their fear. \"With the Hellenists:\" he means those who used the Greek tongue: and this he did, very wisely; for those others, those profound Hebrews had no mind even to see him. \"But they,\" it says, \"went about to slay him:\" a token, this, of his energy, and triumphant victory, and of their exceeding annoyance at what had happened. Thereupon, fearing lest the issue should be the same as in the case of Stephen, they sent him to Caesarea. For it says, \"When the brethren were aware of this, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus\" (v. 30), at the same time to preach, and likely to be more in safety, as being in his own country. But observe, I pray you, how far it is from being the case that everything is done by (miraculous) grace; how, on the contrary, God does in many things leave them to manage for themselves by their own wisdom and in a human way; so[fn-9-P920_825183:8-nf] to cut off the excuse of idle people: for if it was so in the case of Paul, much more in theirs.[fn-9-P921_825394:9-nf] \"Then, it says, \"the Church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace (they), being edified, and walking in the fear of the Lord, and abounded in the comfort of the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-9-P922_826466:10-nf] (v. 31.) He is about to relate that Peter goes down (from Jerusalem), therefore that you may not impute this to fear, he first says this. For while there was persecution, he was in Jerusalem, but when the affairs of the Church are everywhere in security, then it is that he leaves Jerusalem. See how fervent and energetic he is! For he did not think, because there was peace, therefore there was no need of his presence. Paul[fn-9-P923_827143:11-nf] departed, and there was peace: there is no war nor disturbance. Them, they respected most, as having often stood by them, and as being held in admiration by the multitude: but him, they despised, and were more savage against him. See, how great a war, and immediately, peace! See what that war effected. It dispersed the peace-makers. In Samaria, Simon was put to shame: in Judea, the affair of Sapphira took place. Not that, because there was peace, therefore matters became relaxed, but such was the peace as also to need exhortation. \"And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.\" (v. 32.) Like the commander of an army, he went about, inspecting the ranks, what part was compact, what in good order, what needed his presence. See how on all occasions he goes about, foremost. When an Apostle was to be chosen, he was the foremost: when the Jews were to be told, that these were \"not drunken,\" when the lame man was to be healed, when harangues to be made, he is before the rest: when the rulers were to be spoken to, he was the man; when Ananias, he (ch. i. 15; ii. 15; iii. 4-12; iv. 8; v. 3-15.): when healings were wrought by the shadow, still it was he.

When need was to work miracles, he starts forward, and here again he is the man to labor and toil. \"And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy.

Mark the unassuming conduct, mark the moderation of Peter, how he does not make his abode with this lady, or some other person of distinction, but with a tanner: by all his acts leading men to humility, neither suffering the mean to be ashamed, nor the great to be elated! \"Many days; \"[fn-9-P928_836325:16-nf] for they needed his instruction, who had believed through the miracles.-Let us look then again at what has been said.","title":"Homily XXI.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":1,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_28_homily_xxi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"One may well be much at a loss here to understand how it is that, whereas in the Epistle to the Galatians Paul says, \"I went not to Jerusalem,\" but \"into Arabia\" and\" to Damascus,\" and, \"After three years I went up to Jerusalem,\" and \"to see Peter\" (Gal. i. 17), (istorhsai Cat.) here the writer says the contrary. (There, Paul says,) \"And none of the Apostles saw I; but here, it is said (Barnabas), brought him to the Apostles.\"-Well, then, either (Paul) means, \"I went not up with intent to refer or attach myself to them (anaqesqai)-for what saith he? \"I referred not myself, neither went I to Jerusalem to those who were Apostles before me:\"[fn-9-P913_814818:1-nf] or else, that the laying await for him in Damascus was after his return from Arabia;[fn-9-P914_815959:2-nf] or else, again, that the visit to Jerusalem was after he came from Arabia. Certainly of his own accord he went not to the Apostles, but \"assayed to join himself unto the disciples \"-as being[fn-9-P915_816327:3-nf] a teacher, not a disciple-\" I went not,\" he says, \"for this purpose, that I should go to those who were Apostles before me: certainly, I learnt nothing from them.\" Or,[fn-9-P916_816709:4-nf] he does not speak of this visit, but passes it by, so that the order is, \"I went into Arabia, then I came to Damascus, then to Jerusalem, then to Syria:\" or else, again, that he went up to Jerusalem, then was sent to Damascus, then to Arabia, then again to Damascus, then to Caesarea. Also, the visit \"after fourteen years,\" probably, was when he brought up the [alms to the] brethren together with Barnabas: (Gal. ii. 1) or else he means a different occasion. (Acts xi. 30.) For the Historian for conciseness, often omits incidents, and condenses the times. Observe how unambitious the writer is, and how he does not even relate (related in ch. xxii. 17-21) that vision, but passes it by. \"He assayed,\" it says, \"to join himself to the disciples. And they were afraid of him.\" By this again is shown the ardor of Paul's character: not (only) from the mouth of Ananias, and of those who wondered at him there, but also of those in Jerusalem: \"they believed not that he was a disciple:\" for truly that was beyond all human expectation.[fn-9-P917_818923:5-nf] He[fn-9-P918_820001:6-nf] was no longer a wild beast, but a man mild and gentle! And observe how he does not go to the Apostles, such is his forbearance, but to the disciples, as being a disciple. He was not thought worthy of credit. \"But Barnabas\"-\" Son of Consolation\" is his appellation, whence also he makes himself easy of access to the man: for\"he was a kind man\" (ch. xi. 24), exceedingly, and this is proved both by the present instance, and in the affair of John (Mark)-\" having taken him, brought him to the Apostles, and related to them how he had seen the Lord in the way.\"[fn-9-P919_822073:7-nf] (xv. 39.) It is likely that at Damascus also he had heard all about him: whence he was not afraid but the others were, for he was a man whose glance inspired fear. \"How,\" it says, \"he had seen the Lord in the way, and that He had spoken unto him, and how in Damascus he had spoken boldly in the name of the Lord. And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem, and speaking boldly in the name of Jesus\" (v. 28): these things were demonstrative of the former, and by his acts he made good what was spoken of him. \"And he spake, and disputed with the Hellenists.\" (v. 29.) So then the disciples were afraid of him, and the Apostles did not trust him; by this therefore he relieves them of their fear. \"With the Hellenists:\" he means those who used the Greek tongue: and this he did, very wisely; for those others, those profound Hebrews had no mind even to see him. \"But they,\" it says, \"went about to slay him:\" a token, this, of his energy, and triumphant victory, and of their exceeding annoyance at what had happened. Thereupon, fearing lest the issue should be the same as in the case of Stephen, they sent him to Caesarea. For it says, \"When the brethren were aware of this, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus\" (v. 30), at the same time to preach, and likely to be more in safety, as being in his own country. But observe, I pray you, how far it is from being the case that everything is done by (miraculous) grace; how, on the contrary, God does in many things leave them to manage for themselves by their own wisdom and in a human way; so[fn-9-P920_825183:8-nf] to cut off the excuse of idle people: for if it was so in the case of Paul, much more in theirs.[fn-9-P921_825394:9-nf] \"Then, it says, \"the Church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace (they), being edified, and walking in the fear of the Lord, and abounded in the comfort of the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-9-P922_826466:10-nf] (v. 31.) He is about to relate that Peter goes down (from Jerusalem), therefore that you may not impute this to fear, he first says this. For while there was persecution, he was in Jerusalem, but when the affairs of the Church are everywhere in security, then it is that he leaves Jerusalem. See how fervent and energetic he is! For he did not think, because there was peace, therefore there was no need of his presence. Paul[fn-9-P923_827143:11-nf] departed, and there was peace: there is no war nor disturbance. Them, they respected most, as having often stood by them, and as being held in admiration by the multitude: but him, they despised, and were more savage against him. See, how great a war, and immediately, peace! See what that war effected. It dispersed the peace-makers. In Samaria, Simon was put to shame: in Judea, the affair of Sapphira took place. Not that, because there was peace, therefore matters became relaxed, but such was the peace as also to need exhortation. \"And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.\" (v. 32.) Like the commander of an army, he went about, inspecting the ranks, what part was compact, what in good order, what needed his presence. See how on all occasions he goes about, foremost. When an Apostle was to be chosen, he was the foremost: when the Jews were to be told, that these were \"not drunken,\" when the lame man was to be healed, when harangues to be made, he is before the rest: when the rulers were to be spoken to, he was the man; when Ananias, he (ch. i. 15; ii. 15; iii. 4-12; iv. 8; v. 3-15.): when healings were wrought by the shadow, still it was he. And look: where there was danger, he was the man, and where good[fn-9-P924_829465:12-nf] management (was needed); but where all is calm, there they act all in common, and he demands no greater honor (than the others). When need was to work miracles, he starts forward, and here again he is the man to labor and toil. \"And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy. And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And. he arose immediately.\" (v. 33, 34.) And why did he not wait for the man's faith, and ask if he wished to be healed? In the first place, the miracle served for exhortation to many: hear then how great the gain. \"And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.\" (v. 35.) For the man was notable. \"Arise, and make thy bed:\" he does well to give a proof of the miracle: for they not only released men of their diseases, but in giving the health they gave the strength also. Moreover, at that time they had given no proofs of their power, so that the man could not reasonably have been required to show his faith, as neither in the case of the lame man did they demand it. (ch. iii. 6.) As therefore Christ in the beginning of His miracles did not demand faith, so neither did these. For in Jerusalem indeed, as was but reasonable, the faith of the parties was first shown; \"they brought out their sick into the streets, but as Peter passed by, his shadow at least might fall upon some of them\" (ch. v. 15); for many miracles had been wrought there; but here this is the first that occurs. For of the miracles, some were wrought for the purpose of drawing others (to faith); some for the comfort of them that believed. \"Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and alms-deeds which she did. And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber. And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that be would not delay to come to them.\" (v. 36-38). Why did they wait till she was dead? Why was not Peter solicited (eskulh) before this? So right-minded (filosofountej) were they, they did not think it proper to trouble (skullein) the Disciples about such matters, and to take them away from the preaching: as indeed this is why it mentions that the place was near, seeing[fn-9-P925_832299:13-nf] they asked this as a thing beside his mark, and not now in the regular course. \"Not to delay to come unto them:\" for she was a disciple. And Peter arose, and went with them. And when he was come, they led him into the upper chamber.\" (v. 39.) They do not beseech, but leave it to him to give her life (swthrian.) See[fn-9-P926_833202:14-nf] what a cheering inducement to alms is here! \"And all the widows,\" it says, \"stood round him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them.\" Peter went into the apartment, as one who took it calmly, but see what an accession came of it! It is not without a meaning that the Writer has informed us of the woman's name, but to show that the name she bore (ferwnumoj hn) matched her character; as active and wakeful was she as an antelope. For in many instances there is a Providence in the giving of names, as we have often told you. \"She was full,\" it says, \"of good works:\" not only of alms, but \"of good works,\" first, and then of this good work in particular. \"Which,\" it says, \"Dorcas made while she was with them.\" Great humility! Not as we do; but they were all together in common, and in company with them she made these things and worked. \"But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.\" (v. 40.) Why does he put them all out? That he may not be confused nor disturbed by their weeping. \"And having knelt down, he prayed.\" Observe the intentness of his prayer. \"And[fn-9-P927_835086:15-nf] he gave her his hand.\" (v. 41.) So did Christ to the daughter of Jairus: \"And (says the Evangelist) having taken her by the hand.\" Mark severally, first the life, then the strength brought into her, the one by the word, the other by his hand-\" And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive:\" to some for comfort, because they received back their sister, and because they saw the miracle, and for kindly support (prostasian) to others. \"And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.

Hegesippus who lived near the apostolic age, in the fifth book of his Commentaries, writing of James. says \"After the apostles, James the brother of the Lord surnamed the Just was made head of the Church at Jerusalem. Many indeed are called James. This one was holy from his mother's womb. He drank neither wine nor strong drink, ate no flesh, never shaved or anointed himself with ointment or bathed. He alone halt the privilege of entering the Holy of Holies, since indeed he did not use woolen vestments but linen and went alone into the temple and prayed in behalf of the people, insomuch that his knees were reputed to have acquired the hardness of camels' knees.\" He says also many other things, too numerous to mention. Josephus also in the 20th book of his Antiquities, and Clement in the 7th of his Outlines mention that on the death of Fetus who reigned over Judea, Albinus was sent by Nero as his successor. Before he had reached his province, Ananias the high priest, the youthful son of Ananus of the priestly class taking advantage of the state of anarchy, assembled a council and publicly tried to force James to deny that Christ is the son of God. When he refused Ananius ordered him to be stoned. Cast down from a pinnacle of the temple, his legs broken, but still half alive, raising his hands to heaven he said, \"Lord forgive them for they know not what they do.\" Then struck on the head by the club of a fuller such a club as fullers are accustomed to wring out garments[fn-70-P7082_1821611:27-nf] with-he died. This same Josephus records the tradition that this James was of so great sanctity and reputation among the people that the downfall of Jerusalem was believed to be on account of his death. He it is of whom the apostle Paul writes to the Galatians that \"No one else of the apostles did I see except James the brother of the Lord,\" and shortly after the event the Acts of the apostles bear witness to the matter. The Gospel also which is called the Gospel according to the Hebrews,[fn-70-P7083_1822156:28-nf] and which I have recently translated into Greek and Latin and which also Origen[fn-70-P7084_1822347:29-nf] often makes use of, after the account of the resurrection of the Saviour says, \"but the Lord, after he had given his grave clothes to the servant of the priest, appeared to James(for James had. sworn that he would not eat bread from that hour in which he drank the cup of the Lord until he should see him rising again from among those that sleep)\" and again, a little later, it says \"`Bring a table and bread,' said the Lord.\" And immediately it is added, \"He brought bread and blessed and brake and gave to James the Just and said to him, `my brother eat thy bread, for the son of man is risen from among those that sleep.'\" And so he ruled the church of Jerusalem thirty years, that is until the seventh year of Nero, and was buried near the temple from which he had been cast down.

For the abolition of the ancient law we fully admit, and hold that it actually proceeds from the dispensation of the Creator,-a point which we have already often treated in the course of our discussion, when we showed that the innovation was foretold by the prophets of our God.[fn-71-P7191_2083046:46-nf] Now, if the Creator indeed promised that \"the ancient things should pass away,\"[fn-71-P7192_2083190:47-nf] to be superseded by a new course of things which should arise, whilst Christ marks the period of the separation when He says, \"The law and the prophets were until John\"[fn-71-P7193_2083422:48-nf] -thus making the Baptist the limit between the two dispensations of the old things then terminating-and the new things then beginning, the apostle cannot of course do otherwise, (coming as he does) in Christ, who was revealed after John, than invalidate \"the old things\" and confirm \"the new,\" and yet promote thereby the faith of no other god than the Creator, at whose instance[fn-71-P7194_2083821:49-nf] it was foretold that the ancient things should pass away. Therefore both the abrogation of the law and the establishment of the gospel help my argument even in this epistle, wherein they both have reference to the fond assumption of the Galatians, which led them to suppose that faith in Christ (the Creator's Christ, of course) was obligatory, but without annulling the law, because it still appeared to them a thing incredible that the law should be set aside by its own author. Again,[fn-71-P7195_2084325:50-nf] if they had at all heard of any other god from the apostle, would they not have concluded at once, of themselves, that they must give up the law of that God whom they had left, in order to follow another? For what man would be long in learning, that he ought to pursue a new discipline, after he had taken up with a new god? Since, however,[fn-71-P7196_2084678:51-nf] the same God was declared in the gospel which had always been so well known in the law, the only change being in the dispensation,[fn-71-P7197_2084825:52-nf] the sole point of the question to be discussed was, whether the law of the Creator ought by the gospel to be excluded in the Christ of the Creator? Take away this point, and the controversy falls to the ground. Now, since they would all know of themselves,[fn-71-P7198_2085099:53-nf] on the withdrawal of this point, that they must of course renounce all submission to the Creator by reason of their faith in another god, there could have been no call for the apostle to teach them so earnestly that which their own belief must have spontaneously suggested to them. Therefore the entire purport of this epistle is simply to show us that the supersession[fn-71-P7199_2085482:54-nf] of the law comes from the appointment of the Creator-a point, which we shall still have to keep in mind.[fn-72-P7200_2085606:55-nf] Since also he makes mention of no other god (and he could have found no other opportunity of doing so, more suitable than when his purpose was to set forth the reason for the abolition of the law-especially as the prescription of a new god would have afforded a singularly good and most sufficient reason), it is clear enough in what sense he writes, \"I marvel that ye are so soon removed from Him who hath called you to His grace to another gospel\"[fn-72-P7201_2086082:56-nf] -He means) \"another\" as to the conduct it prescribes, not in respect of its worship; \"another\" as to the discipline it teaches, not in respect of its divinity; because it is the office of[fn-72-P7202_2086289:57-nf] Christ's gospel to call men from the law to grace, not from the Creator to another god. For nobody had induced them to apostatize from[fn-72-P7203_2086438:58-nf] the Creator, that they should seem to \"be removed to another gospel,\" simply when they return again to the Creator. When he adds, too, the words, \"which is not another,\"[fn-72-P7204_2086630:59-nf] he confirms the fact that the gospel which he maintains is the Creator's. For the Creator Himself promises the gospel, when He says by Isaiah: \"Get thee up into the high mountain, thou that bringest to Sion good tidings; lift up thy voice with strength, thou that bringest the gospel to Jerusalem.\"[fn-72-P7205_2086945:60-nf] Also when, with respect to the apostles personally, He says, \"How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, that bring good tidings of good\"[fn-72-P7206_2087139:61-nf] -even proclaiming the gospel to the Gentiles, because He also says, \"In His name shall the Gentiles trust; \"[fn-72-P7207_2087266:62-nf] that is, in the name of Christ, to whom He says, \"I have given thee as a light of the Gentiles.\"[fn-72-P7208_2087764:63-nf] However, you will have it that it is the gospel of a new god which was then set forth by the apostle. So that there are two gospels for[fn-72-P7209_2087919:64-nf] two gods; and the apostle made a great mistake when he said that \"there is not another\" gospel,[fn-72-P7210_2088045:65-nf] since there is (on the hypothesis)[fn-72-P7211_2088096:66-nf] another; and so he might have made a better defence of his gospel, by rather demonstrating this, than by insisting on its being but one. But perhaps, to avoid this difficulty, you will say that he therefore added just afterwards, \"Though an angel from heaven preach any other gospel, let him be accursed,\"[fn-72-P7212_2088416:67-nf] because he was aware that the Creator was going to introduce a gospel! But you thus entangle yourself still more. For this is now the mesh in which you are caught. To affirm that there are two gospels, is not the part of a man who has already denied that there is another. His meaning, however, is clear, for he has mentioned himself first (in the anathema): \"But though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel.\"[fn-72-P7213_2088856:68-nf] It is by way of an example that he has expressed himself. If even he himself might not preach any other gospel, then neither might an angel. He said \"angel\" in this way, that he might show how much more men ought not to be believed, when neither an angel nor an apostle ought to be; not that he meant to apply[fn-72-P7214_2089182:69-nf] an angel to the gospel of the Creator. He then cursorily touches on his own conversion from a persecutor to an apostle-confirming thereby the Acts of the Apostles,[fn-72-P7215_2089361:70-nf] in which book may be found the very subject[fn-72-P7216_2089477:71-nf] of this epistle, how that certain persons interposed, and said that men ought to be circumcised, and that the law of Moses was to be observed; and how the apostles, when consulted, determined, by the authority of the Holy Ghost, that \"a yoke should not be put upon men's necks which their fathers even had not been able to bear.\"[fn-72-P7217_2089826:72-nf] Now, since the Acts of the Apostles thus agree with Paul, it becomes apparent why you reject them. It is because they declare no other God than the Creator, and prove Christ to belong to no other God than the Creator; whilst the promise of the Holy Ghost is shown to have been fulfilled in no other document than the Acts of the Apostles. Now, it is not very likely that these[fn-72-P7218_2090256:73-nf] should be found in agreement with the apostle, on the one hand, when they described his career in accordance with his own statement; but should, on the other hand, be at variance with him when they announce the (attribute of) divinity in the Creator's Christ-as if Paul did not follow[fn-72-P7219_2090615:74-nf] the preaching of the apostles when he received from them the prescription[fn-72-P7220_2090714:75-nf] of not teaching the Law.[fn-72-P7221_2090752:76-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"ANF-03","text":"The epistle which we also allow to be the most decisive[fn-71-P7190_2082679:45-nf] against Judaism, is that wherein the apostle instructs the Galatians.

Again,[fn-71-P7195_2084325:50-nf] if they had at all heard of any other god from the apostle, would they not have concluded at once, of themselves, that they must give up the law of that God whom they had left, in order to follow another?

Since, however,[fn-71-P7196_2084678:51-nf] the same God was declared in the gospel which had always been so well known in the law, the only change being in the dispensation,[fn-71-P7197_2084825:52-nf] the sole point of the question to be discussed was, whether the law of the Creator ought by the gospel to be excluded in the Christ of the Creator?

Now, since they would all know of themselves,[fn-71-P7198_2085099:53-nf] on the withdrawal of this point, that they must of course renounce all submission to the Creator by reason of their faith in another god, there could have been no call for the apostle to teach them so earnestly that which their own belief must have spontaneously suggested to them. Therefore the entire purport of this epistle is simply to show us that the supersession[fn-71-P7199_2085482:54-nf] of the law comes from the appointment of the Creator-a point, which we shall still have to keep in mind.[fn-72-P7200_2085606:55-nf] Since also he makes mention of no other god (and he could have found no other opportunity of doing so, more suitable than when his purpose was to set forth the reason for the abolition of the law-especially as the prescription of a new god would have afforded a singularly good and most sufficient reason), it is clear enough in what sense he writes, \"I marvel that ye are so soon removed from Him who hath called you to His grace to another gospel\"[fn-72-P7201_2086082:56-nf] -He means) \"another\" as to the conduct it prescribes, not in respect of its worship; \"another\" as to the discipline it teaches, not in respect of its divinity; because it is the office of[fn-72-P7202_2086289:57-nf] Christ's gospel to call men from the law to grace, not from the Creator to another god. For nobody had induced them to apostatize from[fn-72-P7203_2086438:58-nf] the Creator, that they should seem to \"be removed to another gospel,\" simply when they return again to the Creator. When he adds, too, the words, \"which is not another,\"[fn-72-P7204_2086630:59-nf] he confirms the fact that the gospel which he maintains is the Creator's. For the Creator Himself promises the gospel, when He says by Isaiah: \"Get thee up into the high mountain, thou that bringest to Sion good tidings; lift up thy voice with strength, thou that bringest the gospel to Jerusalem.\"[fn-72-P7205_2086945:60-nf] Also when, with respect to the apostles personally, He says, \"How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, that bring good tidings of good\"[fn-72-P7206_2087139:61-nf] -even proclaiming the gospel to the Gentiles, because He also says, \"In His name shall the Gentiles trust; \"[fn-72-P7207_2087266:62-nf] that is, in the name of Christ, to whom He says, \"I have given thee as a light of the Gentiles.\"[fn-72-P7208_2087764:63-nf] However, you will have it that it is the gospel of a new god which was then set forth by the apostle. So that there are two gospels for[fn-72-P7209_2087919:64-nf] two gods; and the apostle made a great mistake when he said that \"there is not another\" gospel,[fn-72-P7210_2088045:65-nf] since there is (on the hypothesis)[fn-72-P7211_2088096:66-nf] another; and so he might have made a better defence of his gospel, by rather demonstrating this, than by insisting on its being but one. But perhaps, to avoid this difficulty, you will say that he therefore added just afterwards, \"Though an angel from heaven preach any other gospel, let him be accursed,\"[fn-72-P7212_2088416:67-nf] because he was aware that the Creator was going to introduce a gospel! But you thus entangle yourself still more. For this is now the mesh in which you are caught. To affirm that there are two gospels, is not the part of a man who has already denied that there is another. His meaning, however, is clear, for he has mentioned himself first (in the anathema): \"But though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel.\"[fn-72-P7213_2088856:68-nf] It is by way of an example that he has expressed himself. If even he himself might not preach any other gospel, then neither might an angel. He said \"angel\" in this way, that he might show how much more men ought not to be believed, when neither an angel nor an apostle ought to be; not that he meant to apply[fn-72-P7214_2089182:69-nf] an angel to the gospel of the Creator. He then cursorily touches on his own conversion from a persecutor to an apostle-confirming thereby the Acts of the Apostles,[fn-72-P7215_2089361:70-nf] in which book may be found the very subject[fn-72-P7216_2089477:71-nf] of this epistle, how that certain persons interposed, and said that men ought to be circumcised, and that the law of Moses was to be observed; and how the apostles, when consulted, determined, by the authority of the Holy Ghost, that \"a yoke should not be put upon men's necks which their fathers even had not been able to bear.\"[fn-72-P7217_2089826:72-nf] Now, since the Acts of the Apostles thus agree with Paul, it becomes apparent why you reject them.

Now, since they would all know of themselves,[fn-71-P7198_2085099:53-nf] on the withdrawal of this point, that they must of course renounce all submission to the Creator by reason of their faith in another god, there could have been no call for the apostle to teach them so earnestly that which their own belief must have spontaneously suggested to them. Therefore the entire purport of this epistle is simply to show us that the supersession[fn-71-P7199_2085482:54-nf] of the law comes from the appointment of the Creator-a point, which we shall still have to keep in mind.[fn-72-P7200_2085606:55-nf] Since also he makes mention of no other god (and he could have found no other opportunity of doing so, more suitable than when his purpose was to set forth the reason for the abolition of the law-especially as the prescription of a new god would have afforded a singularly good and most sufficient reason), it is clear enough in what sense he writes, \"I marvel that ye are so soon removed from Him who hath called you to His grace to another gospel\"[fn-72-P7201_2086082:56-nf] -He means) \"another\" as to the conduct it prescribes, not in respect of its worship; \"another\" as to the discipline it teaches, not in respect of its divinity; because it is the office of[fn-72-P7202_2086289:57-nf] Christ's gospel to call men from the law to grace, not from the Creator to another god. For nobody had induced them to apostatize from[fn-72-P7203_2086438:58-nf] the Creator, that they should seem to \"be removed to another gospel,\" simply when they return again to the Creator. When he adds, too, the words, \"which is not another,\"[fn-72-P7204_2086630:59-nf] he confirms the fact that the gospel which he maintains is the Creator's. For the Creator Himself promises the gospel, when He says by Isaiah: \"Get thee up into the high mountain, thou that bringest to Sion good tidings; lift up thy voice with strength, thou that bringest the gospel to Jerusalem.\"[fn-72-P7205_2086945:60-nf] Also when, with respect to the apostles personally, He says, \"How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, that bring good tidings of good\"[fn-72-P7206_2087139:61-nf] -even proclaiming the gospel to the Gentiles, because He also says, \"In His name shall the Gentiles trust; \"[fn-72-P7207_2087266:62-nf] that is, in the name of Christ, to whom He says, \"I have given thee as a light of the Gentiles.\"[fn-72-P7208_2087764:63-nf] However, you will have it that it is the gospel of a new god which was then set forth by the apostle. So that there are two gospels for[fn-72-P7209_2087919:64-nf] two gods; and the apostle made a great mistake when he said that \"there is not another\" gospel,[fn-72-P7210_2088045:65-nf] since there is (on the hypothesis)[fn-72-P7211_2088096:66-nf] another; and so he might have made a better defence of his gospel, by rather demonstrating this, than by insisting on its being but one. But perhaps, to avoid this difficulty, you will say that he therefore added just afterwards, \"Though an angel from heaven preach any other gospel, let him be accursed,\"[fn-72-P7212_2088416:67-nf] because he was aware that the Creator was going to introduce a gospel! But you thus entangle yourself still more. For this is now the mesh in which you are caught. To affirm that there are two gospels, is not the part of a man who has already denied that there is another. His meaning, however, is clear, for he has mentioned himself first (in the anathema): \"But though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel.\"[fn-72-P7213_2088856:68-nf] It is by way of an example that he has expressed himself. If even he himself might not preach any other gospel, then neither might an angel. He said \"angel\" in this way, that he might show how much more men ought not to be believed, when neither an angel nor an apostle ought to be; not that he meant to apply[fn-72-P7214_2089182:69-nf] an angel to the gospel of the Creator. He then cursorily touches on his own conversion from a persecutor to an apostle-confirming thereby the Acts of the Apostles,[fn-72-P7215_2089361:70-nf] in which book may be found the very subject[fn-72-P7216_2089477:71-nf] of this epistle, how that certain persons interposed, and said that men ought to be circumcised, and that the law of Moses was to be observed; and how the apostles, when consulted, determined, by the authority of the Holy Ghost, that \"a yoke should not be put upon men's necks which their fathers even had not been able to bear.\"[fn-72-P7217_2089826:72-nf] Now, since the Acts of the Apostles thus agree with Paul, it becomes apparent why you reject them. It is because they declare no other God than the Creator, and prove Christ to belong to no other God than the Creator; whilst the promise of the Holy Ghost is shown to have been fulfilled in no other document than the Acts of the Apostles. Now, it is not very likely that these[fn-72-P7218_2090256:73-nf] should be found in agreement with the apostle, on the one hand, when they described his career in accordance with his own statement; but should, on the other hand, be at variance with him when they announce the (attribute of) divinity in the Creator's Christ-as if Paul did not follow[fn-72-P7219_2090615:74-nf] the preaching of the apostles when he received from them the prescription[fn-72-P7220_2090714:75-nf] of not teaching the Law.[fn-72-P7221_2090752:76-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"ANF-03","text":"The epistle which we also allow to be the most decisive[fn-71-P7190_2082679:45-nf] against Judaism, is that wherein the apostle instructs the Galatians.

Therefore both the abrogation of the law and the establishment of the gospel help my argument even in this epistle, wherein they both have reference to the fond assumption of the Galatians, which led them to suppose that faith in Christ (the Creator's Christ, of course) was obligatory, but without annulling the law, because it still appeared to them a thing incredible that the law should be set aside by its own author. Again,[fn-71-P7195_2084325:50-nf] if they had at all heard of any other god from the apostle, would they not have concluded at once, of themselves, that they must give up the law of that God whom they had left, in order to follow another? For what man would be long in learning, that he ought to pursue a new discipline, after he had taken up with a new god? Since, however,[fn-71-P7196_2084678:51-nf] the same God was declared in the gospel which had always been so well known in the law, the only change being in the dispensation,[fn-71-P7197_2084825:52-nf] the sole point of the question to be discussed was, whether the law of the Creator ought by the gospel to be excluded in the Christ of the Creator?

It was accordingly not without good reason that he described them as \"not wishing indeed to be unclothed,\" but (rather as wanting) \"to be clothed upon; \"[fn-77-P7743_2213338:563-nf] in other words, as wishing not to undergo death, but to be surprised into life,[fn-77-P7744_2213438:564-nf] \"that this moral (body) might be swallowed up of life,\"[fn-77-P7745_2213518:565-nf] by being rescued from death in the supervesture of its changed state. This is why he shows us how much better it is for us not to be sorry, if we should be surprised by death, and tells us that we even hold of God \"the earnest of His Spirit\"[fn-77-P7746_2213835:566-nf] (pledged as it were thereby to have \"the clothing upon,\" which is the object of our hope), and that \"so long as we are in the flesh, we are absent from the Lord; \"[fn-77-P7747_2214019:567-nf] moreover, that we ought on this account to prefer[fn-77-P7748_2214089:568-nf] \"rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord,\"[fn-77-P7749_2214178:569-nf] and so to be ready to meet even death with joy. In this view it is that he informs us how \"we must all appear before the judgement-seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according as he hath done either good or bad.\"[fn-77-P7750_2214449:570-nf] Since, however, there is then to be a retribution according to men's merits, how will any be able to reckon with[fn-77-P7751_2214583:571-nf] God? But by mentioning both the judgment-seat and the distinction between works good and bad, he sets before us a Judge who is to award both sentences,[fn-77-P7752_2214756:572-nf] and has thereby affirmed that all will have to be present at the tribunal in their bodies. For it will be impossible to pass sentence except on the body, for what has been done in the body. God would be unjust, if any one were not punished or else rewarded in that very condition,[fn-77-P7753_2215058:573-nf] wherein the merit was itself achieved. \"If therefore any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old; things are passed away; behold, all things are become new; \"[fn-77-P7754_2215260:574-nf] and so is accomplished the prophecy of Isaiah.[fn-77-P7755_2215328:575-nf] When also he (in a later passage) enjoins us \"to cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of flesh and blood\"[fn-77-P7756_2215458:576-nf] (since this substance enters not the kingdom of Gods[fn-77-P7757_2215548:577-nf] ); when, again, he \"espouses the church as a chaste virgin to Christ,\"[fn-77-P7758_2215641:578-nf] a spouse to a spouse in very deed,[fn-77-P7759_2215697:579-nf] an image cannot be combined and compared with what is opposed to the real nature the thing (with which it is compared). when he designates \"false apostles, deceitful workers transforming themselves\" into likenesses of himself,[fn-77-P7760_2215957:580-nf] of course by their hypocrisy, he charges them with the guilt of disorderly conversation, rather than of false doctrine.[fn-77-P7761_2216099:581-nf] The contrariety, therefore, was one of conduct, not of gods.[fn-77-P7762_2216195:582-nf] If \"Satan himself, too, is transformed into an angel of light,\"[fn-77-P7763_2216412:583-nf] such an assertion must not be used to the prejudice of the Creator. The Creator is not an angel, but God. Into a god of light, and not an angel of light, must Satan then have been said to be transformed, if he did not mean to call him \"the angel,\" which both we and Marcion know him to be. On Paradise is the title of a treatise of ours, in which is discussed all that the subject admits of.[fn-77-P7764_2216826:584-nf] I shall here simply wonder, in connection with this matter, whether a god who has no dispensation of any kind on earth could possibly have a paradise to call his own-without perchance availing himself of the paradise of the Creator, to use it as he does His world-much in the character of a mendicant.[fn-77-P7765_2217237:585-nf] And yet of the removal of a man from earth to heaven we have an instance afforded us by the Creator in Elijah.[fn-77-P7766_2217489:586-nf] But what will excite my surprise still more is the case (next supposed by Marcion), that a God so good and gracious, and so averse to blows and cruelty, should have suborned the angel Satan-not his own either, but the Creator's-\"to buffet\" the apostle,[fn-77-P7767_2217765:587-nf] and then to have refused his request, when thrice entreated to liberate him! It would seem, therefore, that Marcion's god imitates the Creator's conduct, who is an enemy to the proud, even \"putting down the mighty from their seats.\"[fn-77-P7768_2218023:588-nf] Is he then the same God as He who gave Satan power over the person of Job that his \"strength might be made perfect in weakness? \"[fn-77-P7769_2218204:589-nf] How is it that the censurer of the Galatians[fn-77-P7770_2218285:590-nf] still retains the very formula of the law: \"In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established? \"[fn-77-P7771_2218423:591-nf] How again is it that he threatens sinners \"that he will not spare\" them[fn-77-P7772_2218518:592-nf] -he, the preacher of a most gentle god?

I think that the Apostle took not the praise of men for any great thing, saying in another place, \"But to me it is the least thing, that I be judged of you, or of day of man;\"[fn-42-P4236_2008604:77-nf] and in another place, \"If I were pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ;\"[fn-42-P4237_2008708:78-nf] and again, \"For our glory is this, the testimony of our conscience.\"[fn-42-P4238_2008794:79-nf] But of these two, that is, of a good life, and a good report, or as is said more shortly, of virtue and praise, the one for his own sake he most wisely kept, the other for the sake of others he most mercifully provided. But, forasmuch as human caution, how great soever, cannot on every side avoid most malevolent suspicions, when for our good report we shall have done whatever we rightly can, if any, either by falsely pretending evil things of us, or from believing evil of us, endeavor to stain our fair fame, let there be present the solace of conscience, and clearly also the joy, in that our reward is great in Heaven, even when men say many evil things of us,[fn-42-P4239_2009481:80-nf] and we yet live godly and righteously. For that reward is as the pay of such as serve as soldiers, through the arms of righteousness, not only on the right hand, but on the left also; that is to say, through glory and mean estate, through ill report and good report.[fn-42-P4240_2009770:81-nf] ","title":"On the Good of Widowhood","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_27_introduction_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"99","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"[20.] But to return to the matter in hand: It behoves us then to have a great dread of the crime of perverting the faith and adulterating religion, a crime from which we are deterred not only by the Church's discipline, but also by the censure of apostolical authority.

Whoever, then, denies that our body and its members, which the apostle so approves and extols, are the handiwork of God, you see whom he contradicts, preaching contrary to what you have received. So, instead of refuting his opinions, I may leave him to be accursed of all Christians. The apostle says, God tempered the body. Faustus says, Not God, but Hyle. Anathemas are more suitable than arguments to such contradictions. You cannot say that God is here called the God of this world. And if any one understands the passage where this expression does occur to mean that the devil blinds the minds of unbelievers, we grant that he does so by his evil suggestions, from yielding to which, men lose the light of righteousness in God's righteous retribution. This is all in accordance with sacred Scripture. The apostle himself speaks of temptation from without: \"I fear lest, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity and purity. that is in Christ.\"[fn-19-P1994_1165246:14-nf] To the same purpose are the words. \"Evil communications corrupt good manners;\"[fn-19-P1995_1165344:15-nf] and when he speaks of a man deceiving himself, \"Whoever thinketh himself to be anything, when he is nothing, deceiveth himself;\"[fn-19-P1996_1165493:16-nf] or again, in the passage already quoted of the judgment of God, \"God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient.\"[fn-19-P1997_1165661:17-nf] Similarly, in the Old Testament, after the words, \"God did not create death, nor hath He pleasure in the destruction of the living,\" we read, \"By the envy of the devil death entered into the world.\"[fn-19-P1998_1165877:18-nf] And again of death, that men may not put the blame from themselves, \"The wicked invite her with hands and voice; and thinking her a friend, they are drawn down.\"[fn-19-P1999_1166069:19-nf] Elsewhere. however, it is said, \"Good and evil, life and death, riches and poverty, are from the Lord God.\"[fn-20-P2000_1166195:20-nf] This seems perplexing to people who do not understand that, apart from the manifest judgment to follow hereafter upon every evil work, there is an actual judgment at the time; so that in one action, besides the craft of the deceiver and the wickedness of the voluntary agent, there is also the just penalty of the judge: for while the devil suggests, and man consents, God abandons. So, if you join the words, God of this world, and understand that the devil blinds unbelievers by his mischievous delusions, the meaning is not a bad one. For the word God is not used by itself, but with the qualification of this world, that is, of wicked men, who seek to prosper only in this age. In this sense the world is also called evil, where it is written, \"that He might deliver us from this present evil age.\"[fn-20-P2001_1167018:21-nf] In the same way, in the expression, \"whose god is their belly,\" it is only in connection with the word whose that the belly is called god. So also, in the Psalms, the devils would not be called gods without adding \"of the nations.\"[fn-20-P2002_1167266:22-nf] But in the passage we are now considering it is not said, The god of this world, or, Whose god is their belly, or, The gods of the nations are devils; but simply, God has tempered the body, which can be understood only of the true God, the Creator of all. There is no disparaging addition here, as in the other cases. But perhaps Faustus will say that God tempered the body, not as the maker of it, in the arrangement of its members, but by mixing His light with it. Thus Faustus would attribute to some other being than God the construction of the body, and the arrangement of its members, while God tempered the evil of the construction by the mixture of His goodness. Such are the inventions with which the Manichaeans cram feeble minds. But God, in aid of the feeble, by the mouth of the sacred writers rebukes this opinion. For we read a few verses before: \"God has placed the members every one of them in the body, as it has pleased Him.\" Evidently, God is said to have tempered the body, because He has constructed it of many members, which in their union preserve the variety of their respective functions.","title":"Book XXI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_35_on_lying_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"35","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"28.

So great blindness, moreover, hath occupied men's minds, that to them it is too little if we pronounce some lies not to be sins; but they must needs pronounce it to be sin in some things if we refuse to lie: and to such a pass have they been brought by defending lying, that even that first kind which is of all the most abominably wicked they pronounce to have been used by the Apostle Paul.

As regards the prophet Hosea, it is unnecessary for me to explain the meaning of the command, or of the prophet's conduct, when God said to him, \"Go and take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and produce children of whoredoms,\" for the Scripture itself informs us of the origin and purpose of this direction. It proceeds thus: \"For the land hath committed great whoredom, departing from the Lord. So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son. And the Lord said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Judah, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel. And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel. And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said unto him, Call her name No-mercy: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away. But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the Lord their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen. Now when she had weaned No-mercy, she conceived, and bare a son. Then said God, Call his name Not-my-people: for ye are not my people, and I will not be your God. Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured for multitude; and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God. Then shall the children of Israel and the children of Judah be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel. Say ye unto your brethren, My people; and to your sister, She hath found mercy.\"[fn-22-P2281_1375111:174-nf] Since the typical meaning of the command and of the prophet's conduct is thus explained in the same book by the Lord Himself, and since the writings of the apostles declare the fulfillment of this prophecy in the preaching of the New Testament, every one must accept the explanation thus given of the command and of the action of the prophet as the true explanation. Thus it is said by the Apostle Paul, \"That He might make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, which He had afore prepared unto glory, even us, whom He hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles. As He saith also in Hosea, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved. And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there shall they be called the children of the living God.\"[fn-22-P2282_1376010:175-nf] Here Paul applies the prophecy to the Gentiles. So also Peter, writing to the Gentiles, without naming the prophet, borrows his expressions when he says, \"But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye might show forth the praises of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvellous light; which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.\"[fn-22-P2283_1376509:176-nf] From this it is plain that the words of the prophet, \"And the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured for multitude,\" and the words immediately following, \"And it shall be that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there they shall be called the children of the living God,\" do not apply to that Israel which is after the flesh, but to that of which the apostle says to the Gentiles, \"Ye therefore are the seed of Abraham, and heirs according to the promise.\"[fn-22-P2284_1377071:177-nf] But, as many Jews who were of the Israel after the flesh have believed, and will yet believe; for of these were the apostles, and all the thousands in Jerusalem of the company of the apostles, as also the churches of which Paul speaks, when he says to the Galatians, \"I was unknown by face to the churches of Judaea which were in Christ;\"[fn-22-P2285_1377431:178-nf] and again, he explains the passage in the Psalms, where the Lord is called the cornerstone,[fn-22-P2286_1377542:179-nf] as referring to His uniting in Himself the two walls of circumcision and uncircumcision, \"that He might make in Himself of twain one new man, so making peace; and that He might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby: and that He might come and preach peace to them that are far off, and to them that are nigh,\" that is, to the Gentiles and to the Jews; \"for He is our peace, who hath made of both one;\"[fn-22-P2287_1378011:180-nf] to the same purpose we find the prophet speaking of the Jews as the children of Judah, and of the Gentiles as children of Israel, where he says, \"The children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together, and shall make to themselves one head, and shall go up from the land.\" Therefore, to speak against a prophecy thus confirmed by actual events, is to speak against the writings of the apostles as well as those of the prophets; and not only to speak against writings, but to impugn in the most reckless manner the evidence clear as noonday of established facts. In the case of the narrative of Judah, it is perhaps not so easy to recognize, under the disguise of the woman called Tamar, the harlot representing the Church gathered from among the corruption of Gentile superstition; but here, where Scripture explains itself, and where the explanation is confirmed by the writings of the apostles, instead of dwelling longer on this, we may proceed at once to inquire into the meaning of the very things to which Faustus objects in Moses the servant of God.","title":"Book XXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_33_homily_xxvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"(Recapitulation.) \"At that time,\" it says, \"Herod the king stretched forth his hands to afflict certain of the Church.\" (v. 1.)

But this was all the better for Peter, who was thereby made more approved, and evinced his own manly courage. And it says, \"there was earnest prayer making.\" It was the prayer of (filial) affection: it was for a father they asked, a father mild. \"There was,\" it says, \"earnest prayer.\" Hear how they were affected to their teachers. No factions, no perturbation:[fn-10-P1094_1038002:12-nf] but they betook them to prayer, to that alliance which is indeed invincible, to this they betook them for refuge. They did not say, \"What? I, poor insignificant creature that I am, to pray for him!\" for, as they acted of love, they did not give these things a thought.

Mark, how strict the ward! \"And says, Arise.\" (v. 7.) The guards were asleep with him, and therefore perceived nothing of what was happening. \"And a light shined.\" What was the light for? In order that Peter might see as well as hear, and not imagine it to be all fancy. And the command, \"Arise quickly,[fn-10-P1095_1039495:13-nf] \" that he may not be remiss. He also smote him; so deeply did he sleep. (a) \"Rise,\" says he, \"quickly:\" this is not to hurry him (qorubountoj) but to persuade him not to delay. (c) \"And\" immediately \"his chains fell off from his hands.\" (b) How? answer me: where are the heretics?-let them answer. \"And the Angel said unto him,\" etc. (v. 8) by this also convincing him that it is no fancy: to this end he bids him gird himself and put on his shoes, that he may shake off his sleep, and know that it is real. (a) (e) \"And he wist not that it was true that was done by the Angel, but thought he saw a vision\" (v. 9): (e) well he might, by reason of the excessive greatness (uperbolhn) of the things taking place. Do you mark what a thing it is for a miracle to be excessive (ekplhttei shmeiou)? how it amazes (ekplhttei) the beholder? how it will not let the thing be believed?[fn-10-P1096_1041330:14-nf] For if Peter \"thought he saw a vision,\" though he had girded himself and put on his shoes, what would have been the case with another? \"And,\" it says, \"when they had passed the first and the second ward, they came to the iron gate, which opened unto them of its own accord\" (v. 10): and yet the things that had happened within (the prison) were more marvellous: but this was now more after the manner of man. \"And having gone out, they went along one street and immediately (all `until') the Angel departed from him.\" (v. 11.) When there was no hindrance, then the Angel departed. For Peter would not have gone along (prohlqen), there being so many hindrances. \"And when he came to himself:\" for in very truth, it was indeed an amazement (ekplhcij). \"Now,\" saith he, \"I know\"-now, not then, when I was in the prison,-\"that the Lord hath sent His Angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews. And when he had considered\" (v. 12), it says: viz. where he was, or, that he must not without more ado depart but requite his Benefactor: \"he came to the house of Mary the mother of John.\" Who is this John? Probably[fn-10-P1097_1042582:15-nf] he that was always with them: for this is why he adds his distinctive name (to parashmon), \"whose surname was Mark.\" But observe, \"praying\" in the night, how much they got by it: what a good thing affliction is; how wakeful it made them! Do you see how great the gain resulting from the death of Stephen? do you see how great the benefit accruing from this imprisonment? For it is not by taking vengeance upon those who wronged them that God shows the greatness of the Gospel: but in the wrong-doers themselves,[fn-10-P1098_1043369:16-nf] without any harm happening to those, he shows what a mighty thing the afflictions in themselves are, that we may not seek in any wise deliverance from them, nor the avenging of our wrongs. And mark how the very servant-girls were henceforth upon an equality with them. \"For joy,\" it says, \"she opened not.\" (v. 13, 14.) This too is well done, that they likewise may not be amazed by seeing him at once, and that they may be incredulous, and their minds may be exercised. \"But ran in,\" etc. just as we are wont to do, she was eager to be herself the bringer of the good tidings, for good news it was indeed. \"And they said unto her, Thou art mad: but she constantly affirmed that it was even so: then said they, It is his Angel.\" (v. 15.) This is a truth, that each man has an Angel.[fn-10-P1099_1044431:17-nf] And what would the Angel?[fn-11-P1100_1045326:18-nf] It was from the time (of night) that they surmised this. But when he \"continued knocking, and when they had opened, and saw him, they were astonished. But he beckoning to them with his hand\" (v. 16, 17), made them keep quiet, to hear all that had happened to him. He was now an object of more affectionate desire to the disciples, not only in consequence of his being saved, but by his sudden coming in upon them and straightway departing. Now, both his friends learn all clearly; and the aliens also learn, if they had a mind, but they had not. The same thing happened in the case of Christ. \"Tell these things,\" he says, \"to James, and to the brethren.\" How free from all vainglory! Nor did he say, Make known these things to people everywhere, but, \"to the brethren. And he withdrew to another place:\" for he did not tempt God, nor fling himself into temptation: since, when they were commanded to do this, then they did it. \"Go,\" it was said, \"speak in the temple to the people.\" (ch. v. 20.) But this the Angel said not (here); on the contrary, by silently removing him and bringing him out by night, he gave him free permission to withdraw-and this too is done, that we may learn that many things are providentially brought about after the manner of men-so that he should not again fall into peril.-For that they may not say, \"It was his Angel,\"[fn-11-P1101_1046838:19-nf] after he was gone, they say this first, and then they see himself overthrowing their notion of the matter.

He might have had, they say, a flesh which was not at all born. So we have found our way \"out of a frying-pan,\" as the proverb runs, \"into the fire,\"[fn-93-P9343_2564785:85-nf] -from Marcion to Apelles. This man having first fallen from the principles of Marcion into (intercourse with) a woman, in the flesh, and afterwards shipwrecked himself, in the spirit, on the virgin Philumene,[fn-93-P9344_2565081:86-nf] proceeded from that time[fn-93-P9345_2565155:87-nf] to preach that the body of Christ was of solid flesh, but without having been born. To this angel, indeed, of Philumene, the apostle will reply in tones like those in which he even then predicted him, saying, \"Although an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.\"[fn-93-P9346_2565629:88-nf] To the arguments, however, which have been indicated just above, we have now to show our resistance. They allow that Christ really had a body. Whence was the material of it, if not from the same sort of thing as[fn-93-P9347_2565857:89-nf] that in which He appeared? Whence came His body, if His body were not flesh? Whence came His flesh, if it were not born? Inasmuch as that which is born must undergo this nativity in order to become flesh. He borrowed, they say, His flesh from the stars, and from the substances of the higher world. And they assert it for a certain principle, that a body without nativity is nothing to be astonished at, because it has been submitted to angels to appear even amongst ourselves in the flesh without the intervention of the womb. We admit, of course, that such facts have been related. But then, how comes it to pass that a faith which holds to a different rule borrows materials for its own arguments from the faith which it impugns? What has it to do with Moses, who has rejected the God of Moses? Since the God is a different one, everything belonging to him must be different also. But let the heretics always use the Scriptures of that God whose world they also enjoy. The fact will certainly recoil on them as a witness to judge them, that they maintain their own blasphemies from examples derived from Him.[fn-93-P9348_2566998:90-nf] But it is an easy task for the truth to prevail without raising any such demurrer against them. When, therefore, they set forth the flesh of Christ after the pattern of the angels, declaring it to be not born, and yet flesh for all that, I should wish them to compare the causes, both in Christ's case and that of the angels, wherefore they came in the flesh. Never did any angel descend for the purpose of being crucified, of tasting death, and of rising again from the dead. Now, since there never was such a reason for angels becoming embodied, you have the cause why they assumed flesh without undergoing birth. They had not come to die, therefore they also (came not) to be born. Christ, however, having been sent to die, had necessarily to be also born, that He might be capable of death; for nothing is in the habit of dying but that which is born. Between nativity and mortality there is a mutual contrast. The law[fn-93-P9349_2567948:91-nf] which makes us die is the cause of our being born. Now, since Christ died owing to the condition which undergoes death, but that undergoes death which is also born, the consequence was-nay, it was an antecedent necessity-that He must have been born also,[fn-93-P9350_2568215:92-nf] by reason of the condition which undergoes birth; because He had to die in obedience to that very condition which, because it begins with birth, ends in death.[fn-93-P9351_2568387:93-nf] It was not fitting for Him not to be born under the pretence[fn-93-P9352_2568483:94-nf] that it was fitting for Him to die. But the Lord Himself at that very time appeared to Abraham amongst those angels without being born, and yet in the flesh without doubt, in virtue of the before-mentioned diversity of cause. You, however, cannot admit this, since you do not receive that Christ, who was even then rehearsing[fn-93-P9353_2568819:95-nf] how to converse with, and liberate, and judge the human race, in the habit of a flesh which as yet was not born, because it did not yet mean to die until both its nativity and mortality were previously (by prophecy) announced. Let them, then, prove to us that those angels derived their flesh from the stars. If they do not prove it because it is not written, neither will the flesh of Christ get its origin therefrom, for which they borrowed the precedent of the angels. It is plain that the angels bore a flesh which was not naturally their own; their nature being of a spiritual substance, although in some sense peculiar to themselves, corporeal; and yet they could be transfigured into human shape, and for the time be able to appear and have intercourse with men. Since, therefore, it has not been told us whence they obtained their flesh, it remains for us not to doubt in our minds that a property of angelic power is this, to assume to themselves bodily Shape out of no material substance. How much more, you say, is it (within their competence to take a body) out of some material substance? That is true enough. But there is no evidence of this, because Scripture says nothing. Then, again,[fn-93-P9354_2570134:96-nf] how should they who are able to form themselves into that which by nature they are not, be unable to do this out of no material substance? If they become that which they are not, why cannot they so become out of that which is not? But that which has not existence when it comes into existence, is made out of nothing. This is why it is unnecessary either to inquire or to demonstrate what has subsequently become of their[fn-93-P9355_2570570:97-nf] bodies. What came out of nothing, came to nothing. They, who were able to convert themselves into flesh have it in their power to convert nothing itself into flesh. It is a greater thing to change a nature than to make matter. But even if it were necessary to suppose that angels derived their flesh from some material substance, it is surely more credible that it was from some earthly matter than from any kind of celestial substances, since it was composed of so palpably terrene a quality that it fed on earthly ailments. Suppose that even now a celestial flesh [fn-93-P9356_2571155:98-nf] had fed on earthly aliments, although it was not itself earthly, in the same way that earthly flesh actually fed on celestial aliments, although it had nothing of the celestial nature (for we read of manna having been food for the people: \"Man,\" says the Psalmist, \"did eat angels' bread,\"[fn-93-P9357_2571498:99-nf] ) yet this does not once infringe the separate condition of the Lord's flesh, because of His different destination. For One who was to be truly a man, even unto death, it was necessary that He should be clothed with that flesh to which death belongs. Now that flesh to which death belongs is preceded by birth.","title":"On the Flesh of Christ.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_39_on_the_flesh_of_christ_","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"77","folder":"ANF-03","text":"For when Isaiah hurls denunciation against our very heretics, especially in his \"Woe to them that call evil good, and put darkness for light,\"[fn-96-P9643_2644149:331-nf] he of course sets his mark upon those amongst you[fn-96-P9644_2644218:332-nf] who preserve not in the words they employ the light of their true significance, (by taking care) that the soul should mean only that which is so called, and the flesh simply that which is confest to our view and God none other than the One who is preached.[fn-96-P9645_2644489:333-nf] Having thus Marcion in his prophetic view, he says, \"I am God, and there is none else; there is no God beside me.\"[fn-96-P9646_2644624:334-nf] And when in another passage he says, in like manner, \"Before me there was no God,\"[fn-96-P9647_2644727:335-nf] he strikes at those inexplicable genealogies of the Valentinian ¦ons.

Faustus said: We are asked the reason But we do not assert that man is in no sense for our denial that man is made by God. made by God; we only ask in what sense, and when, and how. For, according to the apostle, there are two men, one of whom he calls sometimes the outer man, generally the earthy, sometimes, too, the old man: the other he calls the inner or heavenly or new man.[fn-23-P2341_1416225:1-nf] The question is, Which of these is made by God? For there are likewise two times of our nativity; one when nature brought us forth into this light, binding us in the bonds of flesh; and the other, when the truth regenerated us on our conversion from error and our entrance into the faith. It is this second birth of which Jesus speaks in the Gospel, when He says, \"Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\"[fn-23-P2342_1416726:2-nf] Nicodemus, not knowing what Christ meant, was at a loss, and inquired how this could be, for an old man could not enter into his mother's womb and be born a second time. Jesus said in reply, \"Except a man be born of water and of the Holy Spirit, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\" Then He adds, \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.\" Hence, as the birth in which our bodies originate is not the only birth, but there is another in which we are born again in spirit, an important question arises from this distinction as to which of those births it is in which God makes us. The manner of birth also is twofold. In the humiliating process of ordinary generation, we spring from the heat of animal passion; but when we are brought into the faith, we are formed under good instruction in honor and purity in Jesus Christ, by the Holy Spirit. For this reason, in all religion, and especially in the Christian religion, young children are invited to membership. This is hinted at in the words of His apostle: \"My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you.\"[fn-23-P2343_1417885:3-nf] The question, then, is not whether God makes man, but what man He makes, and when, and how. For if it is when we are fashioned in the womb that God forms us after His own image, which is the common belief of Gentiles and Jews, and which is also your belief, then God makes the old man, and produces us by means of sensual passion, which does not seem suitable to His divine nature. But if it is when we are converted and brought to a better life that we are formed by God, which is the general doctrine of Christ and His apostles, and which is also our doctrine, in this case God makes us new men, and produces us in honor and purity, which would agree perfectly with His sacred and adorable majesty. If you do not reject Paul's authority, we will prove to you from him what man God makes, and when, and how. He says to the Ephesians, \"That ye put off according to your former conversation the old man, which is corrupt through deceitful lusts; and be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and holiness of truth.\"[fn-23-P2344_1418981:4-nf] This shows that in the creation of man after the image of God, it is another man that is spoken of, and another birth, and another manner of birth. The putting off and putting on of which he speaks, point to the time of the reception of the truth; and the assertion that the new man is created by God implies that the old man is created neither by God nor after God. And when he adds, that this new man is made in holiness and righteousness and truth, he thus points to another manner of birth of which this is the character, and which, as I have said, differs widely from the manner in which bodily generation is effected. And as he declares that only the former is of God, it follows that the latter is not. Again, writing to the Colossians, he uses words to the same effect: \"Put off the old man with his deeds, and put on the new man, which is renewed in the knowledge of God according to the image of Him who created Him in you.\" Here he not only shows that it is the new man that God makes, but he declares the time and manner of the formation, for the words in the knowledge of God point to the time of believing. Then he adds, according to the image of Him who created him, to make it clear that the old man is not the image of God, nor formed by God. Moreover, the following words, \"Where there is neither male nor female, Jew nor Greek, Barbarian nor Scythian,\"[fn-23-P2345_1420372:5-nf] show more plainly still that the birth by which we are made male and female, Greeks and Jews, Scythians and Barbarians, is not the birth in which God effects the formation of man; but that the birth with which God has to do is that in which we lose the difference of nation and sex and condition, and become one like Him who is one, that is, Christ. So the same apostle says again, \"As many as have been baptized in Christ have put on Christ: there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither male nor female, there is neither bond nor free; but all are one in Christ.\"[fn-23-P2346_1420960:6-nf] Man, then, is made by God, not when from one he is divided into many, but when from many he becomes one. The division is in the first birth, or that of the body; union comes by the second, which is immaterial and divine. This affords sufficient ground for our opinion, that the birth of the body should be ascribed to nature, and the second birth to the Supernal Majesty. So the same apostle says again to the Corinthians, \"I have begotten you in Christ Jesus by the gospel;\"[fn-23-P2347_1421459:7-nf] and, speaking of himself, to the Galatians, \"When it pleased Him, who separated me from my mother's womb, to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood.\"[fn-23-P2348_1421703:8-nf] It is plain that everywhere he speaks of the second or spiritual birth as that in which we are made by God, as distinct from the indecency of the first birth, in which we are on a level with other animals as regards dignity and purity, as we are conceived in the maternal womb, and are formed, and brought forth. You may observe that in this matter the dispute between us is not so much about a question of doctrine as of interpretation. For you think that it is the old or outer or earthy man that is said to have been made by God; while we apply this to the heavenly man, giving the superiority to the inner or new man. And our opinion is not rash or groundless, for we have learned it from Christ and His apostles, who are proved to have been the first in the world who thus taught.","title":"Book XXIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_36_homily_xxx_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"But why did he say he was \"sitting at the receipt of custom?\" To indicate the power of Him that called him, that it was not when he had left off or forsaken this wicked trade, but from the midst of the evils He drew him up; much as He converted the blessed Paul also when frantic and raging, and darting fire; which thing he himself makes a proof of the power of Him that called him, saying to the Galatians, \"Ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God.\"[fn-30-P3009_985665:4-nf] And the fishermen too He called when they were in the midst of their business.

He does not wish, but he foresees, it is a prophecy of one who is telling things to come, not a vow of malediction; for the prophets knew by the Spirit to whom evil was appointed to happen, and to whom good; and by prophecy they spake as if they wished for what they did foresee.

Suppose now that by some means Jesus were also called Vestitus (Clothed), as He is actually called Christ from the mystery of His anointing, would you in like manner say that Jesus was the Son of God, and at the same time suppose that Vestitus was the Father? Now then, concerning Christ, if Christ is the Father, the Father is an Anointed One, and receives the unction of course from another. Else if it is from Himself that He receives it, then you must prove it to us. But we learn no such fact from the Acts of the Apostles in that ejaculation of the Church to God, \"Of a truth, Lord, against Thy Holy Child Jesus, whom Thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the people of Israel were gathered together.\"[fn-108-P10857_3048785:396-nf] These then testified both that Jesus was the Son of God, and that being the Son, He was anointed by the Father. Christ therefore must be the same as Jesus who was anointed by the Father, and not the Father, who anointed the Son. To the same effect are the words of Peter: \"Let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ,\" that is, Anointed.[fn-108-P10858_3049223:397-nf] John, moreover, brands that man as \"a liar\" who \"denieth that Jesus is the Christ; \"whilst on the other hand he declares that \"every one is born of God who believeth that Jesus is the Christ.\"[fn-108-P10859_3049436:398-nf] Wherefore he also exhorts us to believe in the name of His (the Father's, ) Son Jesus Christ, that \"our fellowship may be with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.\"[fn-108-P10860_3049653:399-nf] Paul, in like manner, everywhere speaks of \"God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.\" When writing to the Romans, he gives thanks to God through our Lord Jesus Christ.[fn-108-P10861_3049843:400-nf] To the Galatians he declares himself to be \"an apostle not of men, neither by man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father.\"[fn-108-P10862_3049990:401-nf] You possess indeed all his writings, which testify plainly to the same effect, and set forth Two-God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father. (They also testify) that Jesus is Himself the Christ, and under one or the other designation the Son of God. For precisely by the same right as both names belong to the same Person, even the Son of God, does either name alone without the other belong to the same Person. Consequently, whether it be the name Jesus which occurs alone, Christ is also understood, because Jesus is the Anointed One; or if the name Christ is the only one given, then Jesus is identified with Him, because the Anointed One is Jesus. Now, of these two names Jesus Christ, the former is the proper one, which was given to Him by the angel; and the latter is only an adjunct, predicable of Him from His anointing,-thussuggesting the proviso that Christ must be the Son, not the Father. How blind, to be sure, is the man who fails to perceive that by the name of Christ some other God is implied, if he ascribes to the Father this name of Christ! For if Christ is God the Father, when He says, \"I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God,\"[fn-108-P10863_3051210:402-nf] He of course shows plainly enough that there is above Himself another Father and another God.

And if we do not believe them when they tell us that Christ was born of a virgin, how shall we believe what they record as said by Christ of Himself? For, as regards any writing professing to come immediately from Christ Himself, if it were really His, how is it not read and acknowledged and regarded as of supreme authority in the Church, which, beginning with Christ Himself, and continued by His apostles, who were succeeded by the bishops, has been maintained and extended to our own day, and in which is found the fulfillment of many former predictions. while those concerning the last days are sure to be accomplished in the future? In regard to the appearance of such a writing, it would require to be considered from what quarter it issued. Supposing it to have issued from Christ Himself, those in immediate connection with Him might very well have received it, and have transmitted it to others. In this case, the authority of the writing would be fully established by the traditions of various communities, and of their presidents, as I have already said.

Or, if the question is of Matthew being the real author, who would not, in this also, believe what he finds in the Church, which has a distinct history in unbroken connection from the days of Matthew to the present time, rather than a Persian interloper, who comes more than two hundred years after, and wishes us to believe his account of Christ's words and actions rather than that of Matthew; whereas, even in the case of the Apostle Paul, who was called from heaven after the Lord's ascension, the Church would not have believed him, had there not been apostles in life with whom he might communicate, and compare his gospel with theirs, so as to be recognized as belonging to the same society? When it was ascertained that Paul preached what the apostles preached, and that he lived in fellowship and harmony with them, and when God's testimony was added by Paul's working miracles like those done by the apostles, his authority became so great, that his words are now received in the Church, as if, to use his own appropriate words, Christ were speaking in him.[fn-24-P2409_1460379:2-nf] Manichaeus, on the other hand, thinks that the Church of Christ should believe what he says in opposition to the Scriptures, which are supported by such strong and continuous evidence, and in which the Church finds an emphatic injunction, that whoever preaches to her differently from what she has received must be anathema.[fn-24-P2410_1460722:3-nf] ","title":"Book XXVIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_41_treatise_on_rebuke_and_grace","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"72","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But wherefore do they, who are unwilling be rebuked, say, \"Only prescribe to me, and pray for me that I may do what you prescribe?\" Why do they not rather, in accordance with their own evil inclination, reject these things also, and say, \"I wish you neither to prescribe to me, nor to pray for me\"?

But observe the discretion shown by him also, in making his argument good from the prophets, both new and old.[fn-12-P1288_1239516:1-nf] For he had no acts of his own to declare, as Peter had and Paul. And indeed it is wisely ordered that this (the active) part is assigned to those, as not intended. to be locally fixed in Jerusalem, whereas (James) here, who performs the part of teacher, is no way responsible for what has been done, while however he is not divided from them in opinion.[fn-12-P1289_1240177:2-nf] (b) \"Men and brethren,\" he says, \"hearken unto me.\" Great is the moderation of the man. His also is a more complete oration, as indeed it puts the completion to the matter under discussion. (a) \"Symeon,\" he says, \"declared:\" (namely,) in Luke, in that he prophesied, \"Which Thou hast prepared before the face of all nations, a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of Thy people Israel.\"[fn-12-P1290_1241754:3-nf] (c) \"How God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for His Name.\" (Luke ii. 25.) Then, since that (witness), though[fn-12-P1291_1242622:4-nf] from the time indeed he was manifest, yet had not authority by reason of his not being ancient, therefore he produces ancient prophecy also, saying, \"And to this agree the words of the Prophets, as it is written: After this I wilt return, and will build again the tabernacle of David which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up.\" (v. 16.) What? was Jerusalem raised up? Was it not rather thrown down? What[fn-12-P1292_1243552:5-nf] sort of raising up does he call that which took place after the return from Babylon? \"That the residue of men,\" he says, \"may seek the Lord, even all the Gentiles upon whom My Name is called.\" (v. 17.) Then, what makes his word authoritative-\"Saith the Lord, which doeth all these things:\" and, for that this is no new thing, but all was planned from the beginning, \"Known unto God are all His works from everlasting.\"[fn-12-P1293_1244419:6-nf] (v. 18.) And then again his authority (kai to aciwma palin) (as Bishop): \"Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God: but that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollution of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood. For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.\" (v. 19-21.) Since[fn-12-P1294_1245519:7-nf] then they had heard of the Law, with good reason he enjoins these things from the Law, that he may not seem to make it of no authority. And (yet) observe how he does not let them be told these things from the Law, but from himself, saying, It is not that I heard these things from the Law, but how? \"We have judged.\" Then the decree is made in common. \"Then pleased it the Apostles and elders, together with the whole Church, to choose men of their own company\"-do you observe they do not merely enact these matters, and nothing more?-\"and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas:namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren: and they wrote letters by them after this manner.\" (v. 22.) And observe, the more to authenticate the decree, they send men of their own, that there may be no room for regarding Paul and his company with suspicion. \"The Apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.\" (v. 23.) And mark[fn-12-P1295_1246739:8-nf] with what forbearance of all harsh vituperation of those (brethren) they indite their epistle. \"Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the Law: to whom we gave no such commandment.\" (v. 24.) Sufficient was this charge against the temerity of those men, and worthy of the Apostles' moderation, that they said nothing beyond this. Then to show that they do not act despotically, that all are agreed in this, that with deliberation they write this-\"It seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send men of ours whom we have chosen\" (v. 25)-then, that it may not look like disparagement of Paul and Barnabas, that those men are sent, observe the encomium passed upon them-\"together with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. We have sent therefore Judas and Silas; who shall also tell you the same things by mouth. For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us\"-it is not man's doing, it says-\"to lay upon you no greater burden\"-again it calls the Law a burden: then apologizing even for these injunctions-\"save these necessary things\" (v. 26-28): \"That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. (v. 29.) For these things the New Testament did not enjoin: we nowhere find that Christ discoursed about these matters; but these things they take from the Law. \"From things strangled,\" it says, \"and from blood.\" here it prohibits murder. (Comp. Gen. ix. 5.) \"So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle: which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.\" (v. 30, 31.) Then those (brethren) also exhorted them: and having established them, for towards Paul they were contentiously disposed, so departed from them in peace. \"And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the Apostles.\" (v. 32, 33.)

For these, although relating to the body, were necessary to be observed, because (these things) caused great evils, \"For Moses hath of old times in every city,\" etc. (v. 21.) This above all quieted them. (anepausen) (a) For this cause I affirm that it is good (so \"to write to them.\") Then why do we not write the same injunctions to Jews also? Moses discourses unto them. See what condescension (to their weakness)! Where it did no harm, he set him up as teacher, and indulged them with a gratification which hindered nothing, by permitting Jews to hear him in regard of these matters, even while leading away from him them of the Gentiles. See what wisdom! He seems to honor him, and to set him up as the authority for his own people, and by this very thing he leads away the Gentiles from him![fn-13-P1306_1260255:18-nf] \"Being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.\" Then why do they not learn (what is to be learnt) out of him, for instance * *?[fn-13-P1307_1261620:19-nf] Through the perversity of these men. He shows that even these (the Jews) need observe no more (than these necessary thing's). And if we do not write to them, it is not that they are bound to observe anything more, but only that they have one to tell them. And he does not say, Not to offend, nor to turn them back,[fn-13-P1308_1262182:20-nf] which is what Paul said to the Galatians, but, \"not to trouble them:\" he shows that the point (katorqwma) if carried is nothing but a mere troubling. Thus he made an end of the whole matter;[fn-13-P1309_1262434:21-nf] and while he seems to preserve the Law by adopting these rules from it, he unbinds it by taking only these. (c)[fn-13-P1310_1262658:22-nf] There was a design of Providence in the disputation also, that after the disputation the doctrine might be more firm. \"Then pleased it the Apostles to send chosen men of their own company,\" etc., no ordinary persons, but the \"leading men; having written\" (letters) \"by them after this manner. To those in Antioch,\" it says, \"and Syria and Cilicia.\" (v. 22, 23) where the disease had its birth.Observe how they say nothing harsher (fortikwteron) against those men, but look to one thing only, namely, to undo (the mischief) which has been done. For this would make even the movers of the faction there to confess (that they were wrong). They do not say, The seducers, the pestilent fellows, or suchlike: though where need is, Paul does this, as when he says, \"O full of all guile\" (ch. xiii. 10): but here, the point being carried, there was no need. And observe, they do not put it, That certain from us ordered you to keep the Law, but, \"Troubled you with words, subverting your souls,\"-nothing could be more proper (kuriwteron) than that word: none (of the other speakers) has so spoken of the things done by those men. \"The souls,\" he says, already strongly established, these persons are anasxeuazontej as in speaking of a building, \"taking them down again:\" displacing them (metatiqentej) from the foundation).[fn-13-P1311_1264172:23-nf] \"To whom,\" he says, \"we gave no such commandment. It seemed good therefore to us being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you together with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, men that have hazarded their lives for the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ.\" (v. 25, 26.) If \"beloved,\" they will not despise them, if they \"have hazarded their lives,\" they have themselves a right to be believed. \"We have sent,\" it saith, \"Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by word of mouth.\" (v. 27.) For it was necessary that there should be not merely the Epistle there by itself, lest they should say that Paul and Barnabas had suppressed[fn-13-P1312_1265115:24-nf] (the real purport), that they said one thing instead of another. The encomium passed upon Paul stopped their mouths. For this is the reason why neither Paul comes alone nor Barnabas (with him), but others also from the Church; that he may not be suspected, seeing it was he that advocated that doctrine: nor yet those from Jerusalem alone. It shows that they have a right to be believed. \"For it seemed good,\" say they, \"to the Holy Ghost and to us\" (v. 28): not making themselves equal (to Him[fn-13-P1313_1266934:25-nf] )-they are not so mad. But why does it put this (so)? Why did they add, \"And to us,\" and yet it had sufficed to say, \"To the Holy Ghost?\" The one, \"To the Holy Ghost,\" that they may not deem it to be of man; the other, \"To us,\" that they may be taught that they also themselves admit (the Gentiles), although themselves being in circumcision. They have to speak to men who are still weak and afraid of them: this is the reason why this also is added. And it shows that it is not by way of condescension that they speak, neither because they spared them, nor as considering them weak, but the contrary; for great was the reverence of the teachers also.[fn-13-P1314_1268339:26-nf] \"To lay upon you no greater burden\"-they[fn-13-P1315_1268737:27-nf] are ever calling it a burden-and again, \"save these necessary things:\" for that was a superfluous burden. See here a brief Epistle, with nothing more in it (than was needed), neither arts of persuasion (kataskeuaj) nor reasonings, but simply a command: for it was the Spirit's legislating. \"So when they were dismissed they came to Antioch, and having gathered the multitude together, they delivered to them the epistle.\" (v. 30.) After the epistle, then (Judas and Silas) also themselves exhort them by word (v. 31): for this also was needful, that (Paul and Barnabas) might be quit of all suspicion. \"Being prophets also themselves,\" it says, exhorted the brethren \"with many words.\" It shows here the right that Paul and Barnabas have to be believed. For Paul also might have done this, but it behooved to be done by by these.[fn-13-P1316_1270048:28-nf] \"And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace.

And observe, they do not put it, That certain from us ordered you to keep the Law, but, \"Troubled you with words, subverting your souls,\"-nothing could be more proper (kuriwteron) than that word: none (of the other speakers) has so spoken of the things done by those men. \"The souls,\" he says, already strongly established, these persons are anasxeuazontej as in speaking of a building, \"taking them down again:\" displacing them (metatiqentej) from the foundation).[fn-13-P1311_1264172:23-nf] \"To whom,\" he says, \"we gave no such commandment. It seemed good therefore to us being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you together with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, men that have hazarded their lives for the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ.\" (v. 25, 26.) If \"beloved,\" they will not despise them, if they \"have hazarded their lives,\" they have themselves a right to be believed. \"We have sent,\" it saith, \"Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by word of mouth.\" (v. 27.) For it was necessary that there should be not merely the Epistle there by itself, lest they should say that Paul and Barnabas had suppressed[fn-13-P1312_1265115:24-nf] (the real purport), that they said one thing instead of another. The encomium passed upon Paul stopped their mouths. For this is the reason why neither Paul comes alone nor Barnabas (with him), but others also from the Church; that he may not be suspected, seeing it was he that advocated that doctrine: nor yet those from Jerusalem alone. It shows that they have a right to be believed. \"For it seemed good,\" say they, \"to the Holy Ghost and to us\" (v. 28): not making themselves equal (to Him[fn-13-P1313_1266934:25-nf] )-they are not so mad. But why does it put this (so)? Why did they add, \"And to us,\" and yet it had sufficed to say, \"To the Holy Ghost?\" The one, \"To the Holy Ghost,\" that they may not deem it to be of man; the other, \"To us,\" that they may be taught that they also themselves admit (the Gentiles), although themselves being in circumcision. They have to speak to men who are still weak and afraid of them: this is the reason why this also is added. And it shows that it is not by way of condescension that they speak, neither because they spared them, nor as considering them weak, but the contrary; for great was the reverence of the teachers also.[fn-13-P1314_1268339:26-nf] \"To lay upon you no greater burden\"-they[fn-13-P1315_1268737:27-nf] are ever calling it a burden-and again, \"save these necessary things:\" for that was a superfluous burden. See here a brief Epistle, with nothing more in it (than was needed), neither arts of persuasion (kataskeuaj) nor reasonings, but simply a command: for it was the Spirit's legislating. \"So when they were dismissed they came to Antioch, and having gathered the multitude together, they delivered to them the epistle.\" (v. 30.) After the epistle, then (Judas and Silas) also themselves exhort them by word (v. 31): for this also was needful, that (Paul and Barnabas) might be quit of all suspicion. \"Being prophets also themselves,\" it says, exhorted the brethren \"with many words.\" It shows here the right that Paul and Barnabas have to be believed. For Paul also might have done this, but it behooved to be done by by these.[fn-13-P1316_1270048:28-nf] \"And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace.

Further, what is said in the promise of the Paraclete shows that it cannot possibly refer to Manichaeus, who came so many years after. For it is distinctly said by John, that the Holy Spirit was to come immediately after the resurrection and ascension of the Lord: \"For the Spirit was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified.\"[fn-25-P2515_1521599:33-nf] Now, if the reason why the Spirit was not given was, that Jesus was not glorified, He would necessarily be given immediately on the glorification of Jesus. In the same way, the Cataphrygians[fn-25-P2516_1521809:34-nf] said that they had received the promised Paraclete; and so they fell away from the Catholic faith, forbidding what Paul allowed, and condemning second marriages, which he made lawful. They turned to their own use the words spoken of the Spirit, \"He shall lead you into all truth,\" as if, forsooth, Paul and the other apostles had not taught all the truth, but had left room for the Paraclete of the Cataphrygians. The same meaning they forced from the words of Paul: \"We know in part, and we prophesy in part; but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away;\"[fn-25-P2517_1522526:35-nf] making out that the apostle knew and prophesied in part, when he said, \"Let him do what he will; if he marries, he sinneth not,\"[fn-25-P2518_1522680:36-nf] and that this is done away by the perfection of the Phrygian Paraclete.[fn-25-P2519_1522773:37-nf] And if they are told that they are condemned by the authority of the Church, which is the subject of such ancient promises, and is spread all over the world, they reply that this is in exact fulfillment of what is said of the Paraclete, that the world cannot receive Him.[fn-25-P2520_1523060:38-nf] And are not those passages, \"He shall lead you into all truth,\" and, \"When that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away,\" and, \"The world cannot receive Him,\" precisely those in which you find a prediction of Manichaeus? And so every heresy arising under the name of the Paraclete will have the boldness to make an equally plausible application to itself of such texts. For there is no heresy but will call itself the truth; and the prouder it is, the more likely it will be to call itself perfect truth: and so it will profess to lead into all truth; and since that which is perfect has come by it, it will try to do away with the doctrine of the apostles, to which its own errors are opposed. And as the Church holds by the earnest admonition of the apostle, that \"whoever preaches another gospel to you than that which ye have received, let him be accursed;\"[fn-25-P2521_1523968:39-nf] when the heretical preacher begins to be pronounced accursed by all the world, will he not forthwith exclaim, This is what is written, \"The world cannot receive Him\"?","title":"Book XXXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_45_book_xxxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"24","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"22. We have now only to compare the authority of Manichaeus with that of the apostles. The genuineness of the writings is equally certain in both cases. But no one will compare Manichaeus to the apostles, unless he ceases to be a follower of Christ, who sent the apostles. Who that did not misunderstand Christ's words ever found in them the doctrine of two natures opposed to one another, and having each its own principle? Again, the apostles, as becomes the disciples of truth, declare the birth and passion of Christ to have been real events; while Manichaeus, who boasts that he leads into all truth, would lead us to a Christ whose very passion he declares to have been an illusion. The apostles say that Christ was circumcised in the flesh which He took of the seed of Abraham; Manichaeus says that God, in his own nature, was cut in pieces by the race of darkness. The apostles say that a sacrifice was offered for Christ as an infant in our nature, according to the institutions of the time; Manichaeus, that a member, not of humanity, but of the divine substance itself, must be sacrificed to the whole host of demons by being introduced into the nature of the hostile race. The apostles say that Christ, to set us an example, was baptized in the Jordan; Manichaeus, that God immersed himself in the pollution of darkness, and that he will never wholly emerge, but that the part which cannot be purified will be condemned to eternal punishment. The apostles say that Christ, in our nature, was tempted by the chief of the demons; Manichaeus, that part of God was taken captive by the race of demons. And in the temptation of Christ He resists the tempter; while in the captivity of God, the part taken captive cannot be restored to its origin even after victory. To conclude, Manichaeus, under the guise of an improvement, preaches another gospel, which is the doctrine of devils; and the apostles, after the doctrine of Christ, enjoin that whoever preaches another gospel shall be accursed.[fn-25-P2531_1533552:44-nf] ","title":"Book XXXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_138_a_treatise_of_novatian_concerning_the_trinity_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"63","folder":"ANF-05","text":"And thus also John, describing the nativity of Christ, says: \"The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full Of grace and truth.\".[fn-102-P10209_3183831:80-nf] For, moreover, \"His name is called the Word of God,\"[fn-102-P10210_3183938:81-nf] and not without reason. \"My heart has emitted a good word; \"[fn-102-P10211_3184019:82-nf] which word He subsequently calls by the name of the King inferentially, \"I will tell my works to the King.\"[fn-102-P10212_3184145:83-nf] For \"by Him were made all the works, and without Him was nothing made.\"[fn-102-P10213_3184235:84-nf] \"Whether\" says the apostle \"they be thrones or dominations, or powers, or mights, visible things and invisible, all things subsist by Him.\"[fn-102-P10214_3184392:85-nf] Moreover, this is that word which came unto His own, and His own received Him not.

For He it is who \"as a bride-groom goeth forth from his bride-chamber; He exulted as a giant to run his way. His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and His return unto the ends of it.\"[fn-102-P10217_3185294:88-nf] Because, even to the highest, \"not any one hath ascended into heaven save He who came down from heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.\"[fn-102-P10218_3185452:89-nf] Repeating this same thing, He says: \"Father, glorify me with that glory wherewith I was with Thee before the world was.\"[fn-102-P10219_3185593:90-nf] And if this Word came down from heaven as a bridegroom to the flesh, that by the assumption of flesh He might ascend thither as the Son of man, whence the Son of God had descended as the Word, reasonably, while by the mutual connection both flesh wears the Word of God, and the Son of God assumes the frailty of the flesh; when the flesh being espoused ascending thither, whence without the flesh it had descended, it at length receives that glory which in being shown to have had before the foundation of the world, it is most manifestly proved. to be God. And, nevertheless, while the world itself is said to have been founded after Him, it is found to have been created by Him; by that very divinity in Him whereby, the world was made, both His glory and His authority are proved. Moreover, if, whereas it is the property of none but God to know the secrets of the heart, Christ beholds the secrets of the heart; and if, whereas it belongs to none but God to remit sins, the same Christ remits sins; and if, whereas it is the portion of no man to come from heaven, He descended by coming from heaven; and if, whereas this word can be true of no man, \"I and the Father are one,\"[fn-102-P10220_3186818:91-nf] Christ alone declared this word out of the consciousness of His divinity; and if, finally, the Apostle Thomas, instructed in all the proofs and conditions of Christ's divinity, says in reply to Christ, \"My Lord and my God; \"[fn-102-P10221_3187061:92-nf] and if, besides, the Apostle Paul says, \"Whose are the fathers, and of whom Christ came according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed for evermore,\"[fn-102-P10222_3187236:93-nf] writing in his epistles; and if the same apostle declares that he was ordained \"an apostle not by men, nor of man, but by Jesus Christ; \"[fn-102-P10223_3187392:94-nf] and if the same contends that he learned the Gospel not from men or by man, but received it from Jesus Christ, reasonably Christ is God. Therefore, in this respect, one of two things must needs be established. For since it is evident that all things were made by Christ, He is either before all things, since all things were by Him, and so He is justly God; or because He is man He is subsequent to all things, and justly nothing was made by Him. But we cannot say that nothing was made by Him, when we observe it written that all things were made by Him. He is not therefore subsequent to all things; that is, He is not man only, who is subsequent to all things, but God also, since God is prior to all things. For He is before all things, because all things are by Him, while if He were only man, nothing would be by Him; or if all things were by Him, He would not be man only, because if He were only man, all things would not be by Him; nay, nothing would be by Him. What, then, do they reply? That nothing is by Him, so that He is man only? How then are all things by Him? Therefore He is not man only, but God also, since all things are by Him; so that we reasonably ought to understand that Christ is not man only, who is subsequent to all things, but God also, since by Him all things were made.

What, then, do they venture to say, when their mouth is closed[fn-31-P3169_1846030:1-nf] by the force of truth, with which they will not agree? \"Cyprian,\" say they, \"whose great merits and vast learning we all know, decreed in a Council,[fn-31-P3170_1846196:2-nf] with many of his fellow-bishops contributing their several opinions, that all heretics and schismatics, that is, all who are severed from the communion of the one Church, are without baptism; and therefore, whosoever has joined the communion of the Church after being baptized by them must be baptized in the Church.\" The authority of Cyprian does not alarm me, because I am reassured by his humility. We know, indeed, the great merit of the bishop and martyr Cyprian; but is it in any way greater than that of the apostle and martyr Peter, of whom the said Cyprian speaks as follows in his epistle to Quintus? \"For neither did Peter, whom the Lord chose first, and on whom He built His Church,[fn-31-P3171_1847108:3-nf] when Paul afterwards disputed with him about circumcision, claim or assume anything insolently and arrogantly to himself, so as to say that he held the primacy, and should rather be obeyed of those who were late and newly come. Nor did he despise Paul because he had before been a persecutor of the Church, but he admitted the counsel of truth, and readily assented to the legitimate grounds which Paul maintained; giving us thereby a pattern of concord and patience, that we should not pertinaciously love our own opinions, but should rather account as our own any true and rightful suggestions of our brethren and colleagues for the common health and weal.\"[fn-31-P3172_1847787:4-nf] Here is a passage in which Cyprian records what we also learn in holy Scripture, that the Apostle Peter, in whom the primacy of the apostles shines with such exceeding grace, was corrected by the later Apostle Paul, when he adopted a custom in the matter of circumcision at variance with the demands of truth. If it was therefore possible for Peter in some point to walk not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, so as to compel the Gentiles to judaize, as Paul writes in that epistle in which he calls God to witness that he does not lie; for he says, \"Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not;\"[fn-31-P3173_1848441:5-nf] and, after this sacred and awful calling of God to witness, he told the whole tale, saying in the course of it, \"But when I saw that they walked not uprightly, according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?\"[fn-31-P3174_1848834:6-nf] -if Peter, I say, could compel the Gentiles to live after the manner of the Jews, contrary to the rule of truth which the Church afterwards held, why might not Cyprian, in opposition to the rule of faith which the whole Church afterwards held, compel heretics and schismatics to be baptized afresh? I suppose that there is no slight to Cyprian in comparing him with Peter in respect to his crown of martyrdom; rather I ought to be afraid lest I am showing disrespect towards Peter. For who can be ignorant that the primacy of his apostleship is to be preferred to any episcopate whatever? But, granting the difference in the dignity of their sees, yet they have the same glory in their martyrdom. And whether it may be the case that the hearts of those who confess and die for the true faith in the unity of charity take precedence of each other in different points, the Lord Himself will know, by the hidden and wondrous dispensation of whose grace the thief hanging on the cross once for all confesses Him, and is sent on the selfsame day to paradise,[fn-31-P3175_1849904:7-nf] while Peter, the follower of our Lord, denies Him thrice, and has his crown postponed:[fn-31-P3176_1850013:8-nf] for us it were rash to form a judgment from the evidence. But if any one were now found compelling a man to becircumcised after the Jewish fashion, as a necessary preliminary for baptism, this would meet with much more general repudiation by mankind, than if a man should be compelled to be baptized again. Wherefore, if Peter, on doing this, is corrected by his later colleague Paul, and is yet preserved by the bond of peace and unity till he is promoted to martyrdom, how much more readily and constantly should we prefer, either to the authority of a single bishop, or to the Council of a single province, the rule that has been established by the statutes of the universal Church? For this same Cyprian, in urging his view of the question, was still anxious to remain in the unity of peace even with those who differed from him on this point, as is shown by his own opening address at the beginning of the very Council which is quoted by the Donatists.

Pythagoras exhorts us to consider the Muses more pleasant than the Sirens, teaching us to cultivate wisdom apart from pleasure, and exposing the other mode of attracting the soul as deceptive.

If thou fearest spectators thou wilt not have imitators: thou oughtest therefore to be seen. But thou must not do it to the end thou mayest be seen. Not there should be the end of thy joy, not there the goal of thy rejoicing, that thou shouldest account thyself to have gotten the whole fruit of thy good work, when thou art seen and praised. This is nothing. Despise thyself when thou art praised, let Him be praised in thee who worketh by thee. Therefore do not for thine own praise work the good thou doest: but to the praise of Him from whom thou hast the power to do good. From thyself thou hast the ill doing, from God thou hast the well doing. On the other hand, see perverse men, how preposterous they are. What they do well, they will needs ascribe to themselves; if they do ill, they will needs accuse God. Reverse this distorted and preposterous proceeding, which puts the thing, as one may say, head downwards, which makes that undermost which is uppermost,[fn-44-P4494_2424491:5-nf] and that upwards which is downwards.

And as for him, in his own person, that he was one who laid waste the Church, a persecutor, envious, malignant, it is himself that confesses this, not we that reproach him therewith. Paul loves to have his sins spoken of by us, that He may be glorified who healed such a disease. For it was the hand of the Physician that cut end healed the greatness of the sore. That voice from heaven prostrated the persecutor, and raised up the preacher; killed Saul, and quickened Paul.[fn-44-P4497_2426439:8-nf] For Saul was the persecutor of a holy man; thence had this man his name, when he persecuted the Christians:[fn-44-P4498_2426568:9-nf] afterward of Saul he became Paul. What does the name Paulus mean? Little.

For you have the fruits of an answer pointed out by our Lord's words in the case of the agreement of two persons; as it is said: \"If two of you shall agree upon earth touching anything for which they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.\"[fn-49-P4971_1790561:49-nf] You have another in the fulness of faith, which is compared to a grain of mustard-seed. \"For,\" He says, \"if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain: Be thou removed, and it shall be removed; and nothing shall be impossible to you.\"[fn-49-P4972_1790850:50-nf] You have it in continuance in prayer, which the Lord's words call, by reason of unwearied perseverance in petitioning, importunity: \"For, verily, I say unto you that if not because of his friendship, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as much as he needs.\"[fn-49-P4973_1791154:51-nf] You have it in the fruits of almsgiving: \"Shut up alms in the heart of the poor and it shall pray for thee in the time of tribulation.\"[fn-49-P4974_1791316:52-nf] You have it in the purifying of life and in works of mercy, as it is said: \"Loose the bands of wickedness, undo the bundles that oppress;\" and after a few words in which the barrenness of an unfruitful fast is rebuked, \"then,\" he says, \"thou shall call and the Lord shall hear thee; thou shalt cry, and He shall say, Here am I.\"[fn-49-P4975_1791669:53-nf] Sometimes also excess of trouble causes it to be heard, as it is said: \"When I was in trouble I called unto the Lord, and He heard me;\"[fn-49-P4976_1791838:54-nf] and again: \"Afflict not the stranger for if he crieth unto Me, I will hear him, for I am merciful.\"[fn-49-P4977_1791961:55-nf] You see then in how many ways the gift of an answer may be obtained, so that no one need be crushed by the despair of his conscience for securing those things which are salutary and eternal. For if in contemplating our wretchedness I admit that we are utterly destitute of all those virtues which we mentioned above, and that we have neither that laudable agreement of two persons, nor that faith which is compared to a grain of mustard seed, nor those works of piety which the prophet describes, surely we cannot be without that importunity which He supplies to all who desire it, owing to which alone the Lord promises that He will give whatever He has been prayed to give. And therefore we ought without unbelieving hesitation to persevere, and not to have the least doubt that by continuing in them we shall obtain all those things which we have asked according to the mind of God. For the Lord, in His desire to grant what is heavenly and eternal, urges us to constrain Him as it were by our importunity, as He not only does not despise or reject the importunate, but actually welcomes and praises them, and most graciously promises to grant whatever they have perseveringly hoped for; saying, \"Ask and ye shall receive: seek and ye shall find: knock and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it shall be opened;\"[fn-49-P4978_1793384:56-nf] and again: \"All things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive, and nothing shall be impossible to you.\"[fn-49-P4979_1793529:57-nf] And therefore even if all the grounds for being heard which we have mentioned are altogether wanting, at any rate the earnestness of importunity may animate us, as this is placed in the power of any one who wills without the difficulties of any merits or labours. But let not any suppliant doubt that he certainly will not be heard, so long as he doubts whether he is heard. But that this also shall be sought from the Lord unweariedly, we are taught by the example of the blessed Daniel, as, though he was heard from the first day on which he began to pray, he only obtained the result of his petition after one and twenty days.[fn-49-P4980_1794179:58-nf] Wherefore we also ought not to grow slack in the earnestness of the prayers we have begun, if we fancy that the answer comes but slowly, for fear lest perhaps the gift of the answer be in God's providence delayed, or the angel, who was to bring the Divine blessing to us, may when he comes forth from the Presence of the Almighty be hindered by the resistance of the devil, as it is certain that he cannot transmit and bring to us the desired boon, if he finds that we slack off from the earnestness of the petition made. And this would certainly have happened to the above mentioned prophet unless he had with incomparable steadfastness prolonged and persevered in his prayers until the twenty-first day. Let us then not be at all cast down by despair from the confidence of this faith of ours, even when we fancy that we are far from having obtained what we prayed for, and let us not have any doubts about the Lord's promise where He says: \"All things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing, ye shall receive.\"[fn-49-P4981_1795222:59-nf] For it is well for us to consider this saying of the blessed Evangelist John, by which the ambiguity of this question is clearly solved: \"This is,\" he says, \"the confidence which we have in Him, that whatsoever we ask according to His will, He heareth us.\"[fn-49-P4982_1795789:60-nf] He bids us then have a full and undoubting confidence of the answer only in those things which are not for our own advantage or for temporal comforts, but are in conformity to the Lord's will. And we are also taught to put this into our prayers by the Lord's Prayer, where we say \"Thy will be done,\"-Thine not ours. For if we also remember these words of the Apostle that \"we know not what to pray for as we ought\"[fn-49-P4983_1796228:61-nf] we shall see that we sometimes ask for things opposed to our salvation and that we are most providentially refused our requests by Him who sees what is good for us with greater right and truth than we can. And it is clear that this also happened to the teacher of the Gentiles when he prayed that the messenger of Satan who had been for his good allowed by the Lord's will to buffet him, might be removed, saying: \"For which I besought the Lord thrice that he might depart from me. And He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee, for strength is made perfect in weakness.\"[fn-49-P4984_1796840:62-nf] And this feeling even our Lord expressed when He prayed in the character[fn-49-P4985_1796933:63-nf] of man which He had taken, that He might give us a form of prayer as other things also by His example; saying thus: \"Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt,\"[fn-49-P4986_1797176:64-nf] though certainly His will was not discordant with His Father's will, \"For He had come to save what was lost and to give His life a ransom for many;\"[fn-49-P4987_1797346:65-nf] as He Himself says: \"No man taketh my life from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again.\"[fn-49-P4988_1797507:66-nf] In which character there is in the thirty-ninth Psalm the following sung by the blessed David, of the Unity of will which He ever maintained with the Father: \"To do Thy will: O My God, I am willing.\"[fn-49-P4989_1797727:67-nf] For even if we read of the Father: \"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son,\"[fn-49-P4990_1797852:68-nf] we find none the less of the Son: \"Who gave Himself for our sins.\"[fn-49-P4991_1797935:69-nf] And as it is said of the One: \"Who spared not His own Son, but gave Him for all of us,\"[fn-49-P4992_1798044:70-nf] so it is written of the other: \"He was offered because He Himself willed it.\"[fn-49-P4993_1798146:71-nf] And it is shown that the will of the Father and of the Son is in all things one, so that even in the actual mystery of the Lord's resurrection we are taught that there was no discord of operation.

For you have the fruits of an answer pointed out by our Lord's words in the case of the agreement of two persons; as it is said: \"If two of you shall agree upon earth touching anything for which they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.\"[fn-49-P4971_1790561:49-nf] You have another in the fulness of faith, which is compared to a grain of mustard-seed. \"For,\" He says, \"if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain: Be thou removed, and it shall be removed; and nothing shall be impossible to you.\"[fn-49-P4972_1790850:50-nf] You have it in continuance in prayer, which the Lord's words call, by reason of unwearied perseverance in petitioning, importunity: \"For, verily, I say unto you that if not because of his friendship, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as much as he needs.\"[fn-49-P4973_1791154:51-nf] You have it in the fruits of almsgiving: \"Shut up alms in the heart of the poor and it shall pray for thee in the time of tribulation.\"[fn-49-P4974_1791316:52-nf] You have it in the purifying of life and in works of mercy, as it is said: \"Loose the bands of wickedness, undo the bundles that oppress;\" and after a few words in which the barrenness of an unfruitful fast is rebuked, \"then,\" he says, \"thou shall call and the Lord shall hear thee; thou shalt cry, and He shall say, Here am I.\"[fn-49-P4975_1791669:53-nf] Sometimes also excess of trouble causes it to be heard, as it is said: \"When I was in trouble I called unto the Lord, and He heard me;\"[fn-49-P4976_1791838:54-nf] and again: \"Afflict not the stranger for if he crieth unto Me, I will hear him, for I am merciful.\"[fn-49-P4977_1791961:55-nf] You see then in how many ways the gift of an answer may be obtained, so that no one need be crushed by the despair of his conscience for securing those things which are salutary and eternal. For if in contemplating our wretchedness I admit that we are utterly destitute of all those virtues which we mentioned above, and that we have neither that laudable agreement of two persons, nor that faith which is compared to a grain of mustard seed, nor those works of piety which the prophet describes, surely we cannot be without that importunity which He supplies to all who desire it, owing to which alone the Lord promises that He will give whatever He has been prayed to give. And therefore we ought without unbelieving hesitation to persevere, and not to have the least doubt that by continuing in them we shall obtain all those things which we have asked according to the mind of God. For the Lord, in His desire to grant what is heavenly and eternal, urges us to constrain Him as it were by our importunity, as He not only does not despise or reject the importunate, but actually welcomes and praises them, and most graciously promises to grant whatever they have perseveringly hoped for; saying, \"Ask and ye shall receive: seek and ye shall find: knock and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it shall be opened;\"[fn-49-P4978_1793384:56-nf] and again: \"All things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive, and nothing shall be impossible to you.\"[fn-49-P4979_1793529:57-nf] And therefore even if all the grounds for being heard which we have mentioned are altogether wanting, at any rate the earnestness of importunity may animate us, as this is placed in the power of any one who wills without the difficulties of any merits or labours. But let not any suppliant doubt that he certainly will not be heard, so long as he doubts whether he is heard. But that this also shall be sought from the Lord unweariedly, we are taught by the example of the blessed Daniel, as, though he was heard from the first day on which he began to pray, he only obtained the result of his petition after one and twenty days.[fn-49-P4980_1794179:58-nf] Wherefore we also ought not to grow slack in the earnestness of the prayers we have begun, if we fancy that the answer comes but slowly, for fear lest perhaps the gift of the answer be in God's providence delayed, or the angel, who was to bring the Divine blessing to us, may when he comes forth from the Presence of the Almighty be hindered by the resistance of the devil, as it is certain that he cannot transmit and bring to us the desired boon, if he finds that we slack off from the earnestness of the petition made. And this would certainly have happened to the above mentioned prophet unless he had with incomparable steadfastness prolonged and persevered in his prayers until the twenty-first day. Let us then not be at all cast down by despair from the confidence of this faith of ours, even when we fancy that we are far from having obtained what we prayed for, and let us not have any doubts about the Lord's promise where He says: \"All things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing, ye shall receive.\"[fn-49-P4981_1795222:59-nf] For it is well for us to consider this saying of the blessed Evangelist John, by which the ambiguity of this question is clearly solved: \"This is,\" he says, \"the confidence which we have in Him, that whatsoever we ask according to His will, He heareth us.\"[fn-49-P4982_1795789:60-nf] He bids us then have a full and undoubting confidence of the answer only in those things which are not for our own advantage or for temporal comforts, but are in conformity to the Lord's will. And we are also taught to put this into our prayers by the Lord's Prayer, where we say \"Thy will be done,\"-Thine not ours. For if we also remember these words of the Apostle that \"we know not what to pray for as we ought\"[fn-49-P4983_1796228:61-nf] we shall see that we sometimes ask for things opposed to our salvation and that we are most providentially refused our requests by Him who sees what is good for us with greater right and truth than we can. And it is clear that this also happened to the teacher of the Gentiles when he prayed that the messenger of Satan who had been for his good allowed by the Lord's will to buffet him, might be removed, saying: \"For which I besought the Lord thrice that he might depart from me. And He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee, for strength is made perfect in weakness.\"[fn-49-P4984_1796840:62-nf] And this feeling even our Lord expressed when He prayed in the character[fn-49-P4985_1796933:63-nf] of man which He had taken, that He might give us a form of prayer as other things also by His example; saying thus: \"Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt,\"[fn-49-P4986_1797176:64-nf] though certainly His will was not discordant with His Father's will, \"For He had come to save what was lost and to give His life a ransom for many;\"[fn-49-P4987_1797346:65-nf] as He Himself says: \"No man taketh my life from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again.\"[fn-49-P4988_1797507:66-nf] In which character there is in the thirty-ninth Psalm the following sung by the blessed David, of the Unity of will which He ever maintained with the Father: \"To do Thy will: O My God, I am willing.\"[fn-49-P4989_1797727:67-nf] For even if we read of the Father: \"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son,\"[fn-49-P4990_1797852:68-nf] we find none the less of the Son: \"Who gave Himself for our sins.\"[fn-49-P4991_1797935:69-nf] And as it is said of the One: \"Who spared not His own Son, but gave Him for all of us,\"[fn-49-P4992_1798044:70-nf] so it is written of the other: \"He was offered because He Himself willed it.\"[fn-49-P4993_1798146:71-nf] And it is shown that the will of the Father and of the Son is in all things one, so that even in the actual mystery of the Lord's resurrection we are taught that there was no discord of operation. For just as the blessed Apostle declares that the Father brought about the resurrection of His body, saying: \"And God the Father, who raised Him from the dead,\"[fn-49-P4994_1798569:72-nf] so also the Son testifies that He Himself will raise again the Temple of His body, saying: \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again.\"[fn-49-P4995_1798808:73-nf] And therefore we being instructed by all these examples of our Lord which have been enumerated ought to end our supplications also with the same prayer, and always to subjoin this clause to all our petitions: \"Nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt.\"[fn-49-P4996_1799084:74-nf] But it is clear enough that one who does not[fn-49-P4997_1799204:75-nf] pray with attention of mind cannot observe that threefold reverence[fn-49-P4998_1800699:76-nf] which is usually practised in the assemblies of the brethren at the close of service.","title":"IX.

Knowing, then, as I do, how to explain these things in detail, I deem it right at present to quote the words themselves. But since the expressions themselves urge us to speak of them. I shall not omit to do so. For these are truly divine and glorious things, and things well calculated to benefit the soul. The prophet, in using the expression, a lion's whelp, means him who sprang from Judah and David according to the flesh, who was not made indeed of the seed of David, but was conceived by the (power of the) Holy Ghost, and came forth[fn-34-P3455_1080159:30-nf] from the holy shoot of earth. For Isaiah says, \"There shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower shall grow up out of it.\"[fn-34-P3456_1080391:31-nf] That which is called by Isaiah a flower, Jacob calls a shoot. For first he shot forth, and then he flourished in the world. And the expression, \"he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as a lion's whelp,\" refers to the three days' sleep (death, couching) of Christ; as also Isaiah says, \"How is faithful Sion become an harlot! it was full of judgment; in which righteousness lodged (couched); but now murderers.\"[fn-34-P3457_1080824:32-nf] And David says to the same effect, \"I laid me down (couched) and slept; I awaked: for the Lord will sustain me; \"[fn-34-P3458_1080955:33-nf] in which words he points to the fact of his sleep and rising again.

And what are \"the two blind men by the way side,\" but the two people to cure whom Jesus came? Let us show those two people in the Holy Scriptures. It is written in the Gospel, \"Other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also must I bring, that there may be one fold and One Shepherd.\"[fn-47-P4701_2017411:22-nf] Who then are the two people? One the people of the Jews, and the other of the Gentiles. \"I am not sent,\" He saith, \"but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\"[fn-47-P4702_2017593:23-nf] To whom did He say this? To the disciples; when that woman of Canaan who confessed herself to be a dog, cried out that she might be found worthy of the crumbs from the master's[fn-47-P4703_2017789:24-nf] table. And because she was found worthy, now were the two people to whom He had come made manifest: the Jewish people, to wit, of whom He said, \"I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel;\" and the people of the Gentiles, whose type this woman exhibited whom He had first rejected, saying, \"It is not meet to cast the children's bread to the dogs;\" and to whom when she said, \"Truth, Lord, yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table;\" He answered, \"O woman, great is thy faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt.\"[fn-47-P4704_2018362:25-nf] For of this people also was that centurion of whom the same Lord saith, \"Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.\" Because he had said,\" I am not worthy that Thou shouldest come under my roof, but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.\"[fn-47-P4705_2018669:26-nf] So then the Lord even before His Passion and Glorification pointed out two people, the one to whom He had come because of the promises to the Fathers; and the other whom for His mercy's sake He did not reject; that it might be fulfilled which had been promised to Abraham, \"In thy seed shall all nations be blessed.\"[fn-47-P4706_2019010:27-nf] Wherefore also the Apostle after the Lord's Resurrection and Ascension, when He was despised by the Jews, went to the Gentiles. Not that he was silent however towards the Churches which consisted of Jewish believers; \"I was unknown,\" he says, \"by face unto the Churches of Judaea which were in Christ. But they heard only that he which persecuted us in times past, now preacheth the faithwhich once he destroyed, and they glorified God in me.\"[fn-47-P4707_2019474:28-nf] So again Christ is called the \"Corner Stone who made both one.\"[fn-47-P4708_2019558:29-nf] For a corner joins two walls which come from different sides together. And what was so different as the circumcision and uncircumcision, having one wall from Judaea, the other from the Gentiles? But they are joined together by the corner stone. \"For the stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner.\"[fn-47-P4709_2019913:30-nf] There is no corner in a building, except when two walls coming from different directions meet together, and are joined in a kind of unity.

But since it has some real event represented by it, and the very figure itself has its ground of truth, it escapes all imputation of falsehood. \"The sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell by the way side, some fell upon stony places, some fell among thorns, and some fell upon good ground.\"[fn-48-P4819_2068489:35-nf] Who went out \"to sow,\" or when went he out, or Upon what \"thorns,\" or \"stones\" or \"way side \"or in what field did he sow? If we receive this as a fictitious story, we understand it in a figurative sense; it is fictitious. For if any sower really went out, and did cast the seed in these different places, as we have heard, it were no fiction, and so no falsehood. But now though it be a fiction, yet it is no falsehood. Why? Because the fiction has some further signification, it deceives thee not. It requires only one to understand it, and does not lead any one into error. And thus Christ wishing to convey this lesson to us, sought for fruit, and hereby set forth to us a figurative, and no deceiving fiction; a fiction therefore worthy of praise, not of blame; not one by the examination of which we might run into what was false; but by the diligent investigation of which we might discover what is true.","title":"Sermon XXXIX.

This was dreadful, exceedingly dreadful; but what ensued was worse, and more intolerable than any outrage. Knowing the holy character of the virgins, and that their ears were unaccustomed to pollution, and that they were better able to bear stones and swords than expressions of obscenity, they assailed them with such language. This the Arians suggested to the young men, and laughed at all they said and did; while the holy Virgins and other godly women fled from such words as they would from the bite of asps, but the enemies of Christ assisted them in the work, nay even, it may be, gave utterance to the same; for they were well-pleased with the obscenities which the youths vented upon them.","title":"Part VII.","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_57_discourse_i","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"88","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"43.

As where he says: \"And if we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer.\" For the witness of the passage before us confirms that quoted above, in which he said: \"Of whom is Christ according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed for ever.\" For there he writes: \"Of whom is Christ according to the flesh;\" and here: \"if we have known Christ according to the flesh.\" There: \"who is over all, God blessed for ever;\" and here: \"yet now we no longer know Christ according to the flesh.\" The look of the words is different, but their force and drift is the same. For it is the same Person whom he there declares to be God over all born according to the flesh, whom he here asserts that he no longer knows according to the flesh. And plainly for this reason; viz., because Him whom he had known as born in the flesh, he acknowledges as God for ever; and therefore says that he knows him not after the flesh, because He is over all, God blessed for ever; and the phrase there: \"who is over all God,\" answers to this: \"we no longer know Christ according to the flesh;\" and this phrase: \"we no longer know Christ according to the flesh\" implies this: \"who is God blessed for ever.\"[fn-69-P6991_2528408:6-nf] The declaration of Apostolic teaching then somehow rises, as it were to greater heights, and though it is self-consistent throughout, yet it supports the mystery of the perfect faith, with a still more express statement, and says: \"And though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer,\" i.e., as formerly we knew Him as man as well as God, yet now only as God. For when the frailty of flesh comes to an end, we no longer know anything in Him except the power of Divinity, for all that is in Him is the power of Divine Majesty, where the weakness of human infirmity has ceased to exist. In this passage then he has thoroughly expounded the whole mystery of the Incarnation, and of His perfect Divinity. For where he says: \"And if we have known Christ according to the flesh,\" he speaks of the mystery of God born in flesh. But by adding \"yet now we know Him so no longer,\" he manifests His power when weakness is laid aside. And thus that knowledge of the flesh has to do with His humanity, and that ignorance, with the glory of His Divinity. For to say \"we have known Christ according to the flesh:\" means \"as long as that which was known, existed. Now we no longer know it, after it has ceased to exist. For the nature of flesh has been transformed into a spiritual substance: and that which formerly belonged to the manhood, has all become God's. And therefore we no longer know Christ according to the flesh, because when bodily infirmity has been absorbed by Divine Majesty,[fn-69-P6992_2530822:7-nf] nothing remains in that Sacred Body, from which weakness of the flesh can be known in it. And thus whatever had formerly belonged to a twofold substance, has become attached to a single Power. Since there is no sort of doubt that Christ, who was crucified through human weakness lives entirely through the glory of His Divinity.","title":"Book III.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_85_book_vii_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"47","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"IT would be tedious and almost childish to speak further on this subject. But still in order\nto refute that folly and madness of yours, in which you maintain that the one born ought to be of one\nsubstance with the one who bears, i.e., that nothing can produce something of a different nature to\nitself, I will bring forward some instances of earthly things, to convince you that many creatures\nare produced from things of a different nature. Not that it is possible or right to make any\ncomparison in such a case as this: but that you may not doubt the possibility of that happening in\nthe case of the holy Nativity, which as you see takes place in these frail earthly things. Bees,\ntiniest of creatures though they are, are yet so clever and cunning that we read that they can be\nproduced and spring from things of an entirely different nature. For as they are creatures of\nmarvellous intelligence, and well endowed not merely with sense but with foresight, they are produced\nfrom the gathered flowers of plants. What greater instance do you think can be produced and quoted?\nLiving creatures are produced from inanimate: sensate from insensate.[fn-74-P7465_2743859:14-nf] What artificer, whatarchitect was there? Who\nformed their bodies? Who breathed in their souls? Who gave them articulate sounds by which to\nconverse with each other? Who fashioned and arranged these harmonies of their feet, the cunning of\ntheir mouths, the neatness of their wings? Their powers, wrath, foresight, movements, calmness,\nharmony, differences, wars, peace, arrangements, contrivances, business, government, all those things\nindeed which they have in common with men-from whose teaching, or whose gift did they receive them?\nfrom whose implanting or instruction? Did they gain this through generation? or learn it in their\nmother's womb or from her flesh? They never were in the womb, and had no experience of generation. It\nwas only that flowers which they culled were brought into the hive and from this by a marvellous\ncontrivance bees issued forth.[fn-74-P7466_2744914:15-nf] Then the\nwomb of the mother imparted nothing to the offspring: nor are bees produced from bees. They are but\ntheir artificers, not their authors. From the blossoms of plants living creatures proceed. What is\nthere akin in plants and animals? I fancy then that you see who is the contriver of those things. Go\nnow and inquire whether the Lord could bring about that in the case of His own nativity, which you\nsee that He procured in the case of these tiniest of creatures. Perhaps it is needless after this to\nadd anything further. But still let us add in support of the argument what may not be necessary to\nprove the point. We see how the air is suddenly darkened, and the earth filled with locusts. Show me\ntheir seed-their birth-their mothers. For, as you see, they proceed thence, whence they have their\nbirth. Assertin all these cases that the one who is born must be of one substance with the one who\nbears. And in these assertions you will be shown to be as silly, as you are wild in your denial of\nthe Nativity of the Lord. And what next? Do even you think that we must go on any further? But\nstill we will add something else. There is no doubt that basilisks are produced from the eggs of the\nbirds which in Egypt they call the Ibis. What is there of kindred or relationship between a bird and\na serpent? Why is the thing born not of one substance with that which bears it? And yet those who\nbear are not the authors of all these things, nor do those who are born understand them: but they\nresult from secret causes, and from some inexplicable and manifold law of nature which produces them.\nAnd you are bringing as objections to His Nativity your petty assertions from earthly notions, while\nyou cannot explain the origin of those things, which are produced by His bidding and command, whose\nwill does everything, whose sway causes everything: whom nothing can oppose or resist; and whose will\nis sufficient for everything which can possibly be done.","title":"Book VII.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_96_homily_xxxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"Who is there then to pray over us, since Paul hath departed?

For if when here he loved men so, that when he had the choice of departing\nand being with Christ, he chose to be here, much more will he there display a warmer affection. I\nlove Rome even for this, although indeed one has other grounds for praising it, both for its\ngreatness, and its antiquity, and its beauty, and its populousness, and for its power, and its\nwealth, and for its successes in war. But I let all this pass, and esteem it blessed on this account,\nthat both in his lifetime he wrote to them, and loved them so, and talked with them whiles he was\nwith us, and brought his life to a close there.[fn-34-P3465_3146056:9-nf] Wherefore the city is more notable upon this\nground, than upon all others together. And as a body great and strong, it hath as two glistening eyes\nthe bodies of these Saints. Not so bright is the heaven, when the sun sends forth his rays, as is the\ncity of Rome, sending out these two lights into all parts of the world. From thence will Paul be\ncaught up, from thence Peter. Just bethink you, and shudder (fricate) at\nthe thought of what a sight Rome will see, when Paul ariseth suddenly from that deposit, together\nwith Peter, and is lifted up to meet the Lord. (1 Thess. iv. 17.) What a rose will Rome send up to\nChrist! (Is. xxxv. 1) what two crowns will the city have about it! what golden chains will she be\ngirded with! what fountains possess! Therefore I admire the city, not for the much gold, not for the\ncolumns, not for the other display there, but for these pillars of the Church. (1 Cor. xv. 38.) Would\nthat it were now given me to throw myself round (perixuqhnai) the body of\nPaul, and be riveted to the tomb, and to see the dust of that body that \"filled up that which was\nlacking\" after \"Christ\" Col. i. 24), that bore \"the marks\" (stigmata,)\n(Gal. vi. 17) that sowed the Gospel everywhere yea, the dust of that body through which he ran to and\nfro everywhere! the dust of that body through which Christ spoke, and the Light shone forth more\nbrilliant than any lightning, and the voice started out, more awful than any thunder to the devils!\nthrough which he uttered that blessed voice, saying, \"I could wish that myself were accursed, for my\nbrethren\" (Rom. ix. 3), through which he spake \"before kings, and was not ashamed!\" (Ps. cxix. 46)\nthrough which we come to know Paul through which also Paul's Master! Not so awful to us is the\nthunder, as was that voice to the demons! For if they shuddered at his clothes (Acts xix. 12), much\nmore did they at his voice. This led them away captive, this cleansed out the world, this put a stop\nto diseases, cast out vice, lifted the truth on high, had Christ riding[fn-34-P3466_3148144:10-nf] upon it, and everywhere went about with Him; and\nwhat the Cherubim were, this was Paul's voice, for as He was seated upon those Powers, so was He upon\nPaul's tongue. For it had become worthy of receiving Christ, by speaking those things only which were\nacceptable to Christ, and flying as the Seraphim to height unspeakable! for what more lofty than that\nvoice which says, \"For I am persuaded that neither Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things\npresent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate\nus from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus?\" (Rom. viii. 38, 39.) What pinions doth not this\ndiscourse seem to thee to have? what eyes? (Ez. x. 12.) It was owing to this that he said, \"for we\nare not ignorant of his devices.\" (2 Cor. ii. 11.) Owing to this did the devils flee not only at\nhearing him speak, but even at seeing his garments. This is the mouth, the dust whereof I would fain\nsee, through which Christ spake the great and secret things, and greater than in His own person, (for\nas He wrought, so He also spake greater things by the disciples,[fn-34-P3467_3149417:11-nf] ) through which the Spirit gave those wondrous\noracles to the world! For what good thing did not that mouth effect? Devils it drave out, sins it\nloosed, tyrants it muzzled, philosophers' mouths it stopped, the world it brought over to God,\nsavages it persuaded to learn wisdom, all the whole order of the earth it altered. Things in Heaven\ntoo it disposed what way it listed (1 Cor. v. 3, 4), binding whom it would, and loosing in the other\nworld, \"according unto the power given unto it.\" (2 Cor. xiii. 10.) Nor is it that mouth only, but\nthe heart too would fain see the dust of, which a man would not do wrong to call the heart of the\nworld, and a fountain of countless blessings, and a beginning, and element of our life. For the\nspirit of life was furnished out of it all, and was distributed through the members of Christ, not as\nbeing sent forth by arteries, but by a free choice of good deeds. This heart was so large, as to take\nin entire cities, and peoples, and nations. \"For my heart\" he says, \"is enlarged.\" (ib. vi. 11.) Yet\neven a heart thus large, did this very charity that enlarged it many a time straiten and oppress. For\nhe says, \"Out of much affliction (qliyewj) and anguish (sunoxhj) of heart I wrote unto you.\" (ib. ii. 4.) I were desirous to see that\nheart even after its dissolution, which burned at each one that was lost, which travailed a second\ntime with the children that had proved abortions (Gal. iv. 19), which saw God,[fn-34-P3468_3150916:12-nf] (\"for the pure in heart,\" He says, \"shall see\nGod,\") (Matt. v. 8) which became a Sacrifice, (\"for a sacrifice to God is a contrite heart,\") (Ps.\nli. 17) which was loftier than the heavens, which was wider than the world, which was brighter than\nthe sun's beam, which was warmer than fire, which was stronger than adamant, which sent forth rivers,\n(\"for rivers,\" it says, \"of living water shall flow out of his belly,\") (John vii. 38) wherein was a\nfountain springing up, and watering, not the face of the earth, but the souls of men, whence not\nrivers only, but even fountains of[fn-34-P3469_3151577:13-nf] tears,\nissued day and night, which lived the new life, not this of ours, (for \"I live,\" he says, \"yet not I,\nbut Christ liveth in me,\" (Gal. ii. 20) so Paul's heart was His heart, and a tablet of the Holy\nSpirit, and a book of grace); which trembled for the sins of others, (for I fear, he says, lest by\nany means \"I have bestowed labor upon you in vain; (ib. iv. 11) lest as the serpent beguiled Eve; (2\nCor. xi. 3) lest when I come I should find you not such as I would;\") (ib. xii. 20) which both feared\nfor itself, and was confiding too, (for I fear, he says, \"lest by any means after having preached to\nothers I myself should be a castaway,\" (1 Cor. ix. 27) And, \"I am persuaded that neither angels nor\npowers shall be able to separate us;\") (alluding to Rom. ix. 3) which was counted worthy to love\nChrist as no other man loved Him: which despised death and hell, yet was broken down by brothers'\ntears, (for he says, \"what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart?\") (Acts xxi. 13) which was most\nenduring, and yet could not bear to be absent from the Thessalonians by the space of an hour! (1\nThess. ii. 17; iii. 10.) Fain would I see the dust of hands that were in a chain, through the\nimposition of which the Spirit was furnished, through which the divine writings were written, (for\n\"behold how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand:\" (Gal. vi. 11) and again, \"The\nsalutation of me Paul with mine own hand,\") (1 Cor. xvi. 21) of those hands at the sight of which the\nserpent \"fell off into the fire.\" (Acts xxviii. 5.) Fain would I see the dust of those eyes which\nwere blinded gloriously, which recovered their sight again for the salvation of the world; which even\nin the body were counted worthy to see Christ, which saw earthly things, yet saw them not, which saw\nthe things which are not seen, which saw not sleep, which were watchful at midnight, which were not\neffected as eyes are. I would also see the dust of those feet, which ran through the world and were\nnot weary; which were bound in the stocks when the prison shook, which went through parts habitable\nor uninhabited, which walked on so many journeys. And why need I speak of single parts? Fain would I\nsee the tomb, where the armor of righteousness is laid up, the armor of light, the limbs which now\nlive, but which in life were made dead; and in all whereof Christ lived, which were crucified to the\nworld, which were Christ's members, which were clad in Christ, were a temple of the Spirit, an holy\nbuilding, \"bound in the Spirit,\" (Acts xx. 22) riveted to the fear of God, which had the marks of\nChrist. This body is a wall to that City, which is safer than all towers, and than thousands of\nbattlements. And with it is that of Peter. For he honored him while alive. For he \"went up to see\nPeter.\" (Gal. i. 18) and therefore even when departed grace deigned to give him the same abode with\nhim. Fain would I see the spiritual Lion. For as a lion breathing (Gr. sending,) (Cant. ii. 15) forth\nfire (pur afieij) upon the herds of foxes, so rushed he upon the clan of\ndemons and philosophers, and as the burst of some thunderbolt, was borne down into the host of the\ndevil. (Luke xiii. 32.) For he did not even come to set the battle in array against him, since he\nfeared so and trembled at him, as that if he saw his shadow, and heard his voice, he fled even at a\ndistance. And so did he deliver over to him the fornicator, though at a distance, and again snatched\nhim out of his hands (1 Cor. v. 5, 2 Cor. ii. 7, 11); and so others also, that they might be taught\n\"not to blaspheme.\" (1 Tim. i. 20.) And consider how he sent forth his own liegemen against him,\nrousing them, suppling them. And at one time he says to the Ephesians, \"We wrestle not against flesh\nand blood, but against principalities and powers.\" (Eph. vi. 12.) Then too he puts our prize in\nheavenly places. For we struggle not for things of the earth, he says, but for Heaven, and the things\nin the Heavens. And to others, he says, \"Know ye not that we shall judge Angels? how much more the\nthings of this life?\" (1 Cor. vi. 3.) Let us then, laying all this to heart, stand nobly; for Paul\nwas a man, partaking of the same nature with us, and having everything else in common with us. But\nbecause he showed such great love toward Christ, he went up above the Heavens, and stood with the\nAngels. And so if we too would rouse ourselves up some little, and kindle in ourselves that fire, we\nshall be able to emulate that holy man. For were this impossible, he would never have cried aloud,\nand said, \"Be ye imitators of me, as I am of Christ.\" (1 Cor. xi. 1.) Let us not then admire him\nonly, or be struck with him only, but imitate him, that we too may, when we depart hence, be counted\nworthy to see him, and to share the glory unutterable, which God grant that we may all attain to by\nthe grace and love toward man of our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom, and with Whom, be glory to the\nFather, with the Holy Ghost, now and evermore.

Only let us yield\nourselves worthy of such intercession (sunhgoriaj), that it may not be\nthat we hear Paul's voice here only, but that hereafter, when we are departed, we may be counted\nworthy to see the wrestler of Christ.[fn-34-P3462_3142363:6-nf] Or\nrather, if we hear him here, we shall certainly see him hereafter, if not as standing near him, yet\nsee him we certainly shall, glistening near the Throne of the king.[fn-34-P3463_3142728:7-nf] Where the Cherubim sing the glory, where the\nSeraphim are flying, there shall we see Paul, with Peter, and as a chief[fn-34-P3464_3143013:8-nf] and leader of the choir of the Saints, and shall\nenjoy his generous love. For if when here he loved men so, that when he had the choice of departing\nand being with Christ, he chose to be here, much more will he there display a warmer affection. I\nlove Rome even for this, although indeed one has other grounds for praising it, both for its\ngreatness, and its antiquity, and its beauty, and its populousness, and for its power, and its\nwealth, and for its successes in war. But I let all this pass, and esteem it blessed on this account,\nthat both in his lifetime he wrote to them, and loved them so, and talked with them whiles he was\nwith us, and brought his life to a close there.[fn-34-P3465_3146056:9-nf] Wherefore the city is more notable upon this\nground, than upon all others together. And as a body great and strong, it hath as two glistening eyes\nthe bodies of these Saints. Not so bright is the heaven, when the sun sends forth his rays, as is the\ncity of Rome, sending out these two lights into all parts of the world. From thence will Paul be\ncaught up, from thence Peter. Just bethink you, and shudder (fricate) at\nthe thought of what a sight Rome will see, when Paul ariseth suddenly from that deposit, together\nwith Peter, and is lifted up to meet the Lord. (1 Thess. iv. 17.) What a rose will Rome send up to\nChrist! (Is. xxxv. 1) what two crowns will the city have about it! what golden chains will she be\ngirded with! what fountains possess! Therefore I admire the city, not for the much gold, not for the\ncolumns, not for the other display there, but for these pillars of the Church. (1 Cor. xv. 38.) Would\nthat it were now given me to throw myself round (perixuqhnai) the body of\nPaul, and be riveted to the tomb, and to see the dust of that body that \"filled up that which was\nlacking\" after \"Christ\" Col. i. 24), that bore \"the marks\" (stigmata,)\n(Gal. vi. 17) that sowed the Gospel everywhere yea, the dust of that body through which he ran to and\nfro everywhere! the dust of that body through which Christ spoke, and the Light shone forth more\nbrilliant than any lightning, and the voice started out, more awful than any thunder to the devils!\nthrough which he uttered that blessed voice, saying, \"I could wish that myself were accursed, for my\nbrethren\" (Rom. ix. 3), through which he spake \"before kings, and was not ashamed!\" (Ps. cxix. 46)\nthrough which we come to know Paul through which also Paul's Master! Not so awful to us is the\nthunder, as was that voice to the demons! For if they shuddered at his clothes (Acts xix. 12), much\nmore did they at his voice. This led them away captive, this cleansed out the world, this put a stop\nto diseases, cast out vice, lifted the truth on high, had Christ riding[fn-34-P3466_3148144:10-nf] upon it, and everywhere went about with Him; and\nwhat the Cherubim were, this was Paul's voice, for as He was seated upon those Powers, so was He upon\nPaul's tongue. For it had become worthy of receiving Christ, by speaking those things only which were\nacceptable to Christ, and flying as the Seraphim to height unspeakable! for what more lofty than that\nvoice which says, \"For I am persuaded that neither Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things\npresent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate\nus from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus?\" (Rom. viii. 38, 39.) What pinions doth not this\ndiscourse seem to thee to have? what eyes? (Ez. x. 12.) It was owing to this that he said, \"for we\nare not ignorant of his devices.\" (2 Cor. ii. 11.) Owing to this did the devils flee not only at\nhearing him speak, but even at seeing his garments. This is the mouth, the dust whereof I would fain\nsee, through which Christ spake the great and secret things, and greater than in His own person, (for\nas He wrought, so He also spake greater things by the disciples,[fn-34-P3467_3149417:11-nf] ) through which the Spirit gave those wondrous\noracles to the world! For what good thing did not that mouth effect? Devils it drave out, sins it\nloosed, tyrants it muzzled, philosophers' mouths it stopped, the world it brought over to God,\nsavages it persuaded to learn wisdom, all the whole order of the earth it altered. Things in Heaven\ntoo it disposed what way it listed (1 Cor. v. 3, 4), binding whom it would, and loosing in the other\nworld, \"according unto the power given unto it.\" (2 Cor. xiii. 10.) Nor is it that mouth only, but\nthe heart too would fain see the dust of, which a man would not do wrong to call the heart of the\nworld, and a fountain of countless blessings, and a beginning, and element of our life. For the\nspirit of life was furnished out of it all, and was distributed through the members of Christ, not as\nbeing sent forth by arteries, but by a free choice of good deeds. This heart was so large, as to take\nin entire cities, and peoples, and nations. \"For my heart\" he says, \"is enlarged.\" (ib. vi. 11.) Yet\neven a heart thus large, did this very charity that enlarged it many a time straiten and oppress. For\nhe says, \"Out of much affliction (qliyewj) and anguish (sunoxhj) of heart I wrote unto you.\" (ib. ii. 4.) I were desirous to see that\nheart even after its dissolution, which burned at each one that was lost, which travailed a second\ntime with the children that had proved abortions (Gal. iv. 19), which saw God,[fn-34-P3468_3150916:12-nf] (\"for the pure in heart,\" He says, \"shall see\nGod,\") (Matt. v. 8) which became a Sacrifice, (\"for a sacrifice to God is a contrite heart,\") (Ps.\nli. 17) which was loftier than the heavens, which was wider than the world, which was brighter than\nthe sun's beam, which was warmer than fire, which was stronger than adamant, which sent forth rivers,\n(\"for rivers,\" it says, \"of living water shall flow out of his belly,\") (John vii. 38) wherein was a\nfountain springing up, and watering, not the face of the earth, but the souls of men, whence not\nrivers only, but even fountains of[fn-34-P3469_3151577:13-nf] tears,\nissued day and night, which lived the new life, not this of ours, (for \"I live,\" he says, \"yet not I,\nbut Christ liveth in me,\" (Gal. ii. 20) so Paul's heart was His heart, and a tablet of the Holy\nSpirit, and a book of grace); which trembled for the sins of others, (for I fear, he says, lest by\nany means \"I have bestowed labor upon you in vain; (ib. iv. 11) lest as the serpent beguiled Eve; (2\nCor. xi. 3) lest when I come I should find you not such as I would;\") (ib. xii. 20) which both feared\nfor itself, and was confiding too, (for I fear, he says, \"lest by any means after having preached to\nothers I myself should be a castaway,\" (1 Cor. ix. 27) And, \"I am persuaded that neither angels nor\npowers shall be able to separate us;\") (alluding to Rom. ix. 3) which was counted worthy to love\nChrist as no other man loved Him: which despised death and hell, yet was broken down by brothers'\ntears, (for he says, \"what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart?\") (Acts xxi. 13) which was most\nenduring, and yet could not bear to be absent from the Thessalonians by the space of an hour! (1\nThess. ii. 17; iii. 10.) Fain would I see the dust of hands that were in a chain, through the\nimposition of which the Spirit was furnished, through which the divine writings were written, (for\n\"behold how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand:\" (Gal. vi. 11) and again, \"The\nsalutation of me Paul with mine own hand,\") (1 Cor. xvi. 21) of those hands at the sight of which the\nserpent \"fell off into the fire.\" (Acts xxviii. 5.) Fain would I see the dust of those eyes which\nwere blinded gloriously, which recovered their sight again for the salvation of the world; which even\nin the body were counted worthy to see Christ, which saw earthly things, yet saw them not, which saw\nthe things which are not seen, which saw not sleep, which were watchful at midnight, which were not\neffected as eyes are. I would also see the dust of those feet, which ran through the world and were\nnot weary; which were bound in the stocks when the prison shook, which went through parts habitable\nor uninhabited, which walked on so many journeys. And why need I speak of single parts? Fain would I\nsee the tomb, where the armor of righteousness is laid up, the armor of light, the limbs which now\nlive, but which in life were made dead; and in all whereof Christ lived, which were crucified to the\nworld, which were Christ's members, which were clad in Christ, were a temple of the Spirit, an holy\nbuilding, \"bound in the Spirit,\" (Acts xx. 22) riveted to the fear of God, which had the marks of\nChrist. This body is a wall to that City, which is safer than all towers, and than thousands of\nbattlements. And with it is that of Peter. For he honored him while alive. For he \"went up to see\nPeter.\" (Gal. i. 18) and therefore even when departed grace deigned to give him the same abode with\nhim. Fain would I see the spiritual Lion. For as a lion breathing (Gr. sending,) (Cant. ii. 15) forth\nfire (pur afieij) upon the herds of foxes, so rushed he upon the clan of\ndemons and philosophers, and as the burst of some thunderbolt, was borne down into the host of the\ndevil. (Luke xiii. 32.) For he did not even come to set the battle in array against him, since he\nfeared so and trembled at him, as that if he saw his shadow, and heard his voice, he fled even at a\ndistance. And so did he deliver over to him the fornicator, though at a distance, and again snatched\nhim out of his hands (1 Cor. v. 5, 2 Cor. ii. 7, 11); and so others also, that they might be taught\n\"not to blaspheme.\" (1 Tim. i. 20.) And consider how he sent forth his own liegemen against him,\nrousing them, suppling them. And at one time he says to the Ephesians, \"We wrestle not against flesh\nand blood, but against principalities and powers.\" (Eph. vi. 12.) Then too he puts our prize in\nheavenly places. For we struggle not for things of the earth, he says, but for Heaven, and the things\nin the Heavens. And to others, he says, \"Know ye not that we shall judge Angels? how much more the\nthings of this life?\" (1 Cor. vi. 3.) Let us then, laying all this to heart, stand nobly; for Paul\nwas a man, partaking of the same nature with us, and having everything else in common with us. But\nbecause he showed such great love toward Christ, he went up above the Heavens, and stood with the\nAngels. And so if we too would rouse ourselves up some little, and kindle in ourselves that fire, we\nshall be able to emulate that holy man. For were this impossible, he would never have cried aloud,\nand said, \"Be ye imitators of me, as I am of Christ.\" (1 Cor. xi. 1.) Let us not then admire him\nonly, or be struck with him only, but imitate him, that we too may, when we depart hence, be counted\nworthy to see him, and to share the glory unutterable, which God grant that we may all attain to by\nthe grace and love toward man of our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom, and with Whom, be glory to the\nFather, with the Holy Ghost, now and evermore.

Yet\neven a heart thus large, did this very charity that enlarged it many a time straiten and oppress. For\nhe says, \"Out of much affliction (qliyewj) and anguish (sunoxhj) of heart I wrote unto you.\" (ib. ii. 4.) I were desirous to see that\nheart even after its dissolution, which burned at each one that was lost, which travailed a second\ntime with the children that had proved abortions (Gal. iv. 19), which saw God,[fn-34-P3468_3150916:12-nf] (\"for the pure in heart,\" He says, \"shall see\nGod,\") (Matt. v. 8) which became a Sacrifice, (\"for a sacrifice to God is a contrite heart,\") (Ps.\nli. 17) which was loftier than the heavens, which was wider than the world, which was brighter than\nthe sun's beam, which was warmer than fire, which was stronger than adamant, which sent forth rivers,\n(\"for rivers,\" it says, \"of living water shall flow out of his belly,\") (John vii. 38) wherein was a\nfountain springing up, and watering, not the face of the earth, but the souls of men, whence not\nrivers only, but even fountains of[fn-34-P3469_3151577:13-nf] tears,\nissued day and night, which lived the new life, not this of ours, (for \"I live,\" he says, \"yet not I,\nbut Christ liveth in me,\" (Gal. ii. 20) so Paul's heart was His heart, and a tablet of the Holy\nSpirit, and a book of grace); which trembled for the sins of others, (for I fear, he says, lest by\nany means \"I have bestowed labor upon you in vain; (ib. iv. 11) lest as the serpent beguiled Eve; (2\nCor. xi. 3) lest when I come I should find you not such as I would;\") (ib. xii. 20) which both feared\nfor itself, and was confiding too, (for I fear, he says, \"lest by any means after having preached to\nothers I myself should be a castaway,\" (1 Cor. ix. 27) And, \"I am persuaded that neither angels nor\npowers shall be able to separate us;\") (alluding to Rom. ix. 3) which was counted worthy to love\nChrist as no other man loved Him: which despised death and hell, yet was broken down by brothers'\ntears, (for he says, \"what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart?\") (Acts xxi. 13) which was most\nenduring, and yet could not bear to be absent from the Thessalonians by the space of an hour!

For as a lion breathing (Gr. sending,) (Cant. ii. 15) forth\nfire (pur afieij) upon the herds of foxes, so rushed he upon the clan of\ndemons and philosophers, and as the burst of some thunderbolt, was borne down into the host of the\ndevil.

For he did not even come to set the battle in array against him, since he\nfeared so and trembled at him, as that if he saw his shadow, and heard his voice, he fled even at a\ndistance. And so did he deliver over to him the fornicator, though at a distance, and again snatched\nhim out of his hands (1 Cor. v. 5, 2 Cor. ii. 7, 11); and so others also, that they might be taught\n\"not to blaspheme.\" (1 Tim. i. 20.) And consider how he sent forth his own liegemen against him,\nrousing them, suppling them. And at one time he says to the Ephesians, \"We wrestle not against flesh\nand blood, but against principalities and powers.\" (Eph. vi. 12.) Then too he puts our prize in\nheavenly places. For we struggle not for things of the earth, he says, but for Heaven, and the things\nin the Heavens. And to others, he says, \"Know ye not that we shall judge Angels? how much more the\nthings of this life?\" (1 Cor. vi. 3.) Let us then, laying all this to heart, stand nobly; for Paul\nwas a man, partaking of the same nature with us, and having everything else in common with us. But\nbecause he showed such great love toward Christ, he went up above the Heavens, and stood with the\nAngels.

For it had become worthy of receiving Christ, by speaking those things only which were\nacceptable to Christ, and flying as the Seraphim to height unspeakable! for what more lofty than that\nvoice which says, \"For I am persuaded that neither Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things\npresent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate\nus from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus?\" (Rom. viii. 38, 39.) What pinions doth not this\ndiscourse seem to thee to have? what eyes? (Ez. x. 12.) It was owing to this that he said, \"for we\nare not ignorant of his devices.\" (2 Cor. ii. 11.) Owing to this did the devils flee not only at\nhearing him speak, but even at seeing his garments. This is the mouth, the dust whereof I would fain\nsee, through which Christ spake the great and secret things, and greater than in His own person, (for\nas He wrought, so He also spake greater things by the disciples,[fn-34-P3467_3149417:11-nf] ) through which the Spirit gave those wondrous\noracles to the world! For what good thing did not that mouth effect? Devils it drave out, sins it\nloosed, tyrants it muzzled, philosophers' mouths it stopped, the world it brought over to God,\nsavages it persuaded to learn wisdom, all the whole order of the earth it altered. Things in Heaven\ntoo it disposed what way it listed (1 Cor. v. 3, 4), binding whom it would, and loosing in the other\nworld, \"according unto the power given unto it.\" (2 Cor. xiii. 10.) Nor is it that mouth only, but\nthe heart too would fain see the dust of, which a man would not do wrong to call the heart of the\nworld, and a fountain of countless blessings, and a beginning, and element of our life. For the\nspirit of life was furnished out of it all, and was distributed through the members of Christ, not as\nbeing sent forth by arteries, but by a free choice of good deeds. This heart was so large, as to take\nin entire cities, and peoples, and nations. \"For my heart\" he says, \"is enlarged.\" (ib. vi. 11.) Yet\neven a heart thus large, did this very charity that enlarged it many a time straiten and oppress. For\nhe says, \"Out of much affliction (qliyewj) and anguish (sunoxhj) of heart I wrote unto you.\" (ib. ii. 4.) I were desirous to see that\nheart even after its dissolution, which burned at each one that was lost, which travailed a second\ntime with the children that had proved abortions (Gal. iv. 19), which saw God,[fn-34-P3468_3150916:12-nf] (\"for the pure in heart,\" He says, \"shall see\nGod,\") (Matt. v. 8) which became a Sacrifice, (\"for a sacrifice to God is a contrite heart,\") (Ps.\nli. 17) which was loftier than the heavens, which was wider than the world, which was brighter than\nthe sun's beam, which was warmer than fire, which was stronger than adamant, which sent forth rivers,\n(\"for rivers,\" it says, \"of living water shall flow out of his belly,\") (John vii. 38) wherein was a\nfountain springing up, and watering, not the face of the earth, but the souls of men, whence not\nrivers only, but even fountains of[fn-34-P3469_3151577:13-nf] tears,\nissued day and night, which lived the new life, not this of ours, (for \"I live,\" he says, \"yet not I,\nbut Christ liveth in me,\" (Gal. ii. 20) so Paul's heart was His heart, and a tablet of the Holy\nSpirit, and a book of grace); which trembled for the sins of others, (for I fear, he says, lest by\nany means \"I have bestowed labor upon you in vain; (ib. iv. 11) lest as the serpent beguiled Eve; (2\nCor. xi. 3) lest when I come I should find you not such as I would;\") (ib. xii. 20) which both feared\nfor itself, and was confiding too, (for I fear, he says, \"lest by any means after having preached to\nothers I myself should be a castaway,\" (1 Cor. ix. 27) And, \"I am persuaded that neither angels nor\npowers shall be able to separate us;\") (alluding to Rom. ix. 3) which was counted worthy to love\nChrist as no other man loved Him: which despised death and hell, yet was broken down by brothers'\ntears, (for he says, \"what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart?\") (Acts xxi. 13) which was most\nenduring, and yet could not bear to be absent from the Thessalonians by the space of an hour! (1\nThess. ii. 17; iii. 10.) Fain would I see the dust of hands that were in a chain, through the\nimposition of which the Spirit was furnished, through which the divine writings were written, (for\n\"behold how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand:\" (Gal. vi. 11) and again, \"The\nsalutation of me Paul with mine own hand,\") (1 Cor. xvi. 21) of those hands at the sight of which the\nserpent \"fell off into the fire.\" (Acts xxviii. 5.) Fain would I see the dust of those eyes which\nwere blinded gloriously, which recovered their sight again for the salvation of the world; which even\nin the body were counted worthy to see Christ, which saw earthly things, yet saw them not, which saw\nthe things which are not seen, which saw not sleep, which were watchful at midnight, which were not\neffected as eyes are. I would also see the dust of those feet, which ran through the world and were\nnot weary; which were bound in the stocks when the prison shook, which went through parts habitable\nor uninhabited, which walked on so many journeys. And why need I speak of single parts? Fain would I\nsee the tomb, where the armor of righteousness is laid up, the armor of light, the limbs which now\nlive, but which in life were made dead; and in all whereof Christ lived, which were crucified to the\nworld, which were Christ's members, which were clad in Christ, were a temple of the Spirit, an holy\nbuilding, \"bound in the Spirit,\" (Acts xx. 22) riveted to the fear of God, which had the marks of\nChrist. This body is a wall to that City, which is safer than all towers, and than thousands of\nbattlements. And with it is that of Peter. For he honored him while alive. For he \"went up to see\nPeter.\" (Gal. i. 18) and therefore even when departed grace deigned to give him the same abode with\nhim. Fain would I see the spiritual Lion. For as a lion breathing (Gr. sending,) (Cant. ii. 15) forth\nfire (pur afieij) upon the herds of foxes, so rushed he upon the clan of\ndemons and philosophers, and as the burst of some thunderbolt, was borne down into the host of the\ndevil. (Luke xiii. 32.) For he did not even come to set the battle in array against him, since he\nfeared so and trembled at him, as that if he saw his shadow, and heard his voice, he fled even at a\ndistance. And so did he deliver over to him the fornicator, though at a distance, and again snatched\nhim out of his hands (1 Cor. v. 5, 2 Cor. ii. 7, 11); and so others also, that they might be taught\n\"not to blaspheme.\" (1 Tim. i. 20.) And consider how he sent forth his own liegemen against him,\nrousing them, suppling them. And at one time he says to the Ephesians, \"We wrestle not against flesh\nand blood, but against principalities and powers.\" (Eph. vi. 12.) Then too he puts our prize in\nheavenly places. For we struggle not for things of the earth, he says, but for Heaven, and the things\nin the Heavens. And to others, he says, \"Know ye not that we shall judge Angels? how much more the\nthings of this life?\" (1 Cor. vi. 3.) Let us then, laying all this to heart, stand nobly; for Paul\nwas a man, partaking of the same nature with us, and having everything else in common with us. But\nbecause he showed such great love toward Christ, he went up above the Heavens, and stood with the\nAngels. And so if we too would rouse ourselves up some little, and kindle in ourselves that fire, we\nshall be able to emulate that holy man. For were this impossible, he would never have cried aloud,\nand said, \"Be ye imitators of me, as I am of Christ.\" (1 Cor. xi. 1.) Let us not then admire him\nonly, or be struck with him only, but imitate him, that we too may, when we depart hence, be counted\nworthy to see him, and to share the glory unutterable, which God grant that we may all attain to by\nthe grace and love toward man of our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom, and with Whom, be glory to the\nFather, with the Holy Ghost, now and evermore.

These things, moreover. he has said with the view of showing us that all others who may come alter him will be false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed, like an angel of light. What great thing therefore is it, if his ministers also be transformed into the ministers of righteousness?-whose end shall be according to their works.[fn-36-P3621_1005288:348-nf] He indicates, further, what manner of men these were, and points out by whom they were being circumvented. And when the Galatians are minded to turn away from the Gospel, he says to them: \"I marvel that ye are so soon removed from Him that called you unto another gospel: which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would turn you away[fn-36-P3622_1005837:349-nf] from the Gospel of Christ. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which has been delivered to you, let him be accursed.\"[fn-36-P3623_1006023:350-nf] And again he says: \"To me, who am the least of all the apostles,[fn-36-P3624_1006108:351-nf] is this grace given; \"[fn-36-P3625_1006165:352-nf] and,\" I fill up that which was behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh.\"[fn-36-P3626_1006266:353-nf] And once more, in another place, he declares of himself that he was a minister of Christ more than all others,[fn-36-P3627_1006396:354-nf] as though after him none other was to be looked for at all; for he enjoins that not even an angel from heaven is thus to be received. And how, then, shall we credit the professions of this Manes, who comes from Persis,[fn-36-P3628_1006637:355-nf] and declares himself to be the Paraclete? By this very thing, indeed, I rather recognise in him one of those men who transform themselves, and of whom the Apostle Paul, that elect vessel, has given us very clear indication when he says: \"Now in the last times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; for-bidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received[fn-36-P3629_1007318:356-nf] with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving.\"[fn-36-P3630_1007567:357-nf] The Spirit in the evangelist Matthew is also careful to give note of these words of our Lord Jesus Christ: \"Take heed that no man deceive you: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. But if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. For there shall arise false Christs, and false apostles,[fn-36-P3631_1007948:358-nf] and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told you before. If they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: if they shall say, Behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.\"[fn-36-P3632_1008388:359-nf] And yet, after all these directions, this man, who has neither sign nor portent of any kind to show, who has no affinity to exhibit, who never even had a place among the number of the disciples, who never was a follower of our departed Lord, in whose inheritance we rejoice,-this man, I say, although he never stood by our Lord in His weakness, and although he never came forward as a witness of His testament, yea rather, although he never came even within the acquaintance of those who ministered to Him in His sickness, and, in fine, although he obtains the testimony of no person whatsoever, desires us to believe this profession which he makes of being the Paraclete; whereas, even were you to do signs and wonders, we would still have to reckon you a false Christ, and a false prophet, according to the Scriptures. And therefore it is well for us to act with the greater caution, in accordance with the warning which the sainted apostle gives us, when, in the epistle which he wrote to the Colossians, he speaks in the following terms: \"Continue in the faith grounded and rooted,[fn-36-P3633_1009506:360-nf] and not to be moved away[fn-36-P3634_1009548:361-nf] from the hope of the Gospel, which we have heard,[fn-36-P3635_1009616:362-nf] and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven.\"[fn-36-P3636_1009699:363-nf] And again: \"As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in Him; rooted and built up in Him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. Beware lest any one spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. For in Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead.\"[fn-36-P3637_1010095:364-nf] And after all these matters have been thus carefully set forth, the blessed apostle, like a father speaking to his children, adds the following words, which serve as a sort of seal to his testament: \"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course,[fn-36-P3638_1010371:365-nf] I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto all them also that love His appearing.\"[fn-36-P3639_1010695:366-nf] ","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":1,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"ANF-06","text":"40. I wish you to know, most pious father, that in these days there has arrived in our parts a certain person named Manes, who gives out that he is to complete the doctrine of the New Testament. And in the statements which he has made there have been some things, indeed, which may harmonize with our faith; but there have been also certain affirmations of his which seem very far removed from what has come down to us by the tradition of our fathers. For he has interpreted some doctrines in a strange fashion, imposing on them certain notions of his own, which have appeared to me to be altogether foreign and opposed to the faith. On the ground of these facts I have now been induced to write this letter to you, knowing the completeness and fulness of your intelligence in doctrine, and being assured that none of these things can escape your cognizance. Accordingly, I have also indulged the confident hope that you cannot be kept back by any grudge[fn-36-P3692_1033765:413-nf] from explaining these matters to us. As to myself, indeed, it is not possible that I shall be drawn away into any novel doctrine; nevertheless, in behalf of all the less instructed, I have been led to ask a word with your authority. For, in truth, the man shows himself to be a person of extraordinary force of character, both in speech and in action; and indeed his very aspect and attire also bear that out. But I shall here write down for your information some few points which I have been able to retain in my memory out of all the topics which have been expounded by him: for I know that even by these few you will have an idea of the rest. You well understand, no doubt, that those who seek to set up any new dogma have the habit of very readily perverting into a conformity with their own notions any proofs they desire to take from the Scriptures.[fn-36-P3693_1034637:414-nf] In anticipation, however, of this, the apostolic word marks out the case thus: \"If any one preach any other gospel unto you than that which you have received, let him be accursed.\"[fn-36-P3694_1034870:415-nf] And consequently, in addition to what has been once committed to us by the apostles, a disciple of Christ ought to receive nothing new as doctrine.[fn-36-P3695_1035037:416-nf] But not to make what I have got to say too long, I return to the subject directly in view. This man then maintained that the law of Moses, to speak shortly, does not proceed from the good God, but from the prince of evil; and that it has no kinship with the new law of Christ, but is contrary and hostile to it, the one being the direct antagonist of the other. When I heard such a sentiment propounded, I repeated to the people that sentence of the Gospel in which our Lord Jesus Christ said of Himself: \"I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil it.\"[fn-36-P3696_1035912:417-nf] The man, however, averred that He did not utter this saying at all; for he held that when we find that He did abrogate[fn-36-P3697_1036051:418-nf] that same law, we are bound to give heed, above all other considerations, to the thing which He actually did. Then he began to cite a great variety of passages from the law, and also many from the Gospel and from the Apostle Paul, which have the appearance of contradicting each other. All this he gave forth at the same time with perfect confidence, and without any hesitation or fear; so that I verily believe he has that serpent as his helper, who is ever our adversary. Well, he declared that there in the law God said, \"I make the rich man and the poor man; \"[fn-36-P3698_1036635:419-nf] while here in the Gospel Jesus called the poor blessed,[fn-36-P3699_1036713:420-nf] and added, that no man could be His disciple unless he gave up all that he had.[fn-37-P3700_1036812:421-nf] Again, he maintained that there Moses took silver and gold from the Egyptians when the people[fn-37-P3701_1036927:422-nf] fled out of Egypt;[fn-37-P3702_1037005:423-nf] whereas Jesus delivered the precept that we should lust after nothing belonging to our neighbour. Then he affirmed that Moses had provided in the law, that an eye should be given in penalty for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;[fn-37-P3703_1037252:424-nf] but that our Lord bade us offer the other cheek also to him who smote the one.[fn-37-P3704_1037351:425-nf] He told us, too, that there Moses commanded the man to be punished and stoned who did any work on the Sabbath, and who failed to continue in all things that were written in the law,[fn-37-P3705_1037553:426-nf] as in fact was done to that person who, yet being ignorant, had gathered a bundle of sticks on the Sabbath-day; whereas Jesus cured a cripple on the Sabbath, and ordered him then also to take up his bed.[fn-37-P3706_1037777:427-nf] And further, He did not restrain His disciples from plucking the ears of corn and rubbing them with their hands on the Sabbath-day,[fn-37-P3707_1037929:428-nf] which yet was a thing which it was unlawful to do on the Sabbaths. And why should I mention other instances? For with many different assertions of a similar nature these dogmas of his were propounded with the utmost energy and the most fervid zeal. Thus, too, on the authority of an apostle, he endeavoured to establish the position that the law of Moses is the law of death, and that the law of Jesus, on the contrary, is the law of life. For he based that assertion on the passage which runs thus: \"In which also may God make us[fn-37-P3708_1038479:429-nf] able ministers of the New Testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. But if the ministration of death, engraven in letters on the stones,[fn-37-P3709_1038695:430-nf] was made in glory, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away; how shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious? For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. For if that which shall be done away is glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.\"[fn-37-P3710_1039283:431-nf] And this passage, as you are also well aware, occurs in the second Epistle to the Corinthians. Besides, he added to this another passage out of the first epistle, on which he based his affirmation that the disciples of the Old Testament were earthly and natural; and in accordance with this, that flesh and blood could not possess the kingdom of God.[fn-37-P3711_1039659:432-nf] He also maintained that Paul himself spoke in his own proper person when he said: \"If I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.\"[fn-37-P3712_1039845:433-nf] Further, he averred that the same apostle made this statement most obviously on the subject of the resurrection of the flesh. when he also said that \"he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh,\"[fn-37-P3713_1040114:434-nf] and that according to the letter the law has in it no advantage.[fn-37-P3714_1040199:435-nf] And again he adduced the statement, that \"Abraham has glory, but not before God; \"[fn-37-P3715_1040301:436-nf] and that \"by the law there comes only the knowledge of sin.\"[fn-37-P3716_1040381:437-nf] And many other things did he introduce, with the view of detracting from the honour of the law, on the ground that the law itself is sin; by which statements the simpler people were somewhat influenced, as he continued to bring them forward; and in accordance with all this, he also made use of the affirmation, that \"the law and the prophets were until John.\"[fn-37-P3717_1040764:438-nf] He declared, however, that John preached the true kingdom of heaven; for verily he held, that by the cutting off of his head it was signified that all who went before him, and who had precedence over him, were to be cut off, and that what was to come after him was alone to be maintained. With reference to all these things, therefore, O most pious Archelaus, send us back a short reply in writing: for I have heard that you have studied such matters in no ordinary degree; and that capacity which you possess is God's gift, inasmuch as God bestows these gifts upon those who are worthy of them, and who are His friends, and who show themselves allied to Him in community of purpose and life. For it is our part to prepare ourselves, and to approach the gracious and liberal mind,[fn-37-P3718_1041566:439-nf] and forthwith we receive from it the most bountiful gifts. Accordingly, since the learning which I possess for the discussion of themes like these does not meet the requirements of my desire and purpose, for I confess myself to he an unlearned man, I have sent to you, as I have already said more than once, in the hope of obtaining from your hand the amplest solution to this question.

Moreover, the blessed Apostle Paul, chosen and sent by the Lord, and appointed a preacher of the Gospel truth, lays down these very things in his epistle, saying, \"The Lord Jesus, the same night in which He was betrayed, took bread; and when He had given thanks, He brake it, and said, This is my body, which shall be given for you: do this in remembrance of me. After the same manner also He took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye shall show forth the Lord's death until He come.\"[fn-59-P5984_1883093:22-nf] But if it is both enjoined by the Lord, and the same thing is confirmed and delivered by His apostle, that as often as we drink, we do in remembrance of the Lord the same thing which the Lord also did, we find that what was commanded is not observed by us, unless we also do what the Lord did; and that mixing the Lord's cup in like manner we do not depart from the divine teaching; but that we must not at all depart from the evangelical precepts, and that disciples ought also to observe and to do the same things which the Master both taught dud did. The blessed apostle in another place more earnestly and strongly teaches, saying, \"I wonder that ye are so soon removed from Him that called you into grace, unto another gospel, which is not another; but there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the Gospel of Christ. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any otherwise than that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema.

Either who taught thee, or whom thou hast for a master, or how thou hast taught in the cities, or what things have happened through thy teaching? For I think that thou hast not any wisdom, and art not able to accomplish any work of power. Paul answered: Dost thou suppose that I ought to speak against a desperate man. a magician, who has given his soul up to death, whose destruction and perdition will come speedily? For he ought to speak who pretends to be what he is not, and deceives men by magic art. If thou consentest to hear his words, and to shield him, thou shalt destroy thy soul and thy kingdom, for he is a most base man. And as the Egyptians Jannes and Jambres led Pharaoh and his army astray until they were swallowed up in the sea, so also he, through the instruction of his father the devil, persuades men to do many evils to themselves, and thus deceives many of the innocent, to the peril of thy kingdom. But as for the word of the devil, which I see has been poured out through this man, with groanings of my heart am dealing with the Holy Spirit, that it may clearly shown what it is; for as far as he seems to raise himself towards heaven, so far will he be sunk down into the depth of Hades, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth.
