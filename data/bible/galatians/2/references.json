Perhaps some one may wish to drive us to say, that the Son is sent also by Himself, because the conception and childbirth of Mary is the working of the Trinity, by whose act of creating all things are created. And how, he will go on to say, has the Father sent Him, if He sent Himself? To whom I answer first, by asking him to tell me, if he can, in what manner the Father hath sanctified Him, if He hath sanctified Himself? For the same Lord says both; \"Say ye of Him,\" He says, \"whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God;\"[fn-4-P482_172618:28-nf] while in another place He says, \"And for their sake I sanctify myself.\"[fn-4-P483_172707:29-nf] I ask, also, in what manner the Father delivered Him, if He delivered Himself? For the Apostle Paul says both: \"Who,\" he says, \"spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all;\"[fn-4-P484_172913:30-nf] while elsewhere he says of the Saviour Himself, \"Who loved me, and delivered Himself for me.\"[fn-4-P485_173027:31-nf] He will reply, I suppose, if he has a right sense in these things, Because the will of the Father and the Son is one, and their working indivisible. In like manner, then, let him understand the incarnation and nativity of the Virgin, wherein the Son is understood as sent, to have been wrought by one and the same operation of the Father and of the Son indivisibly; the Holy Spirit certainly not being thence excluded, of whom it is expressly said, \"She was found with child by the Holy Ghost.\" For perhaps our meaning will be more plainly unfolded, if we ask in what manner God sent His Son. He commanded that He should come, and He, complying with the commandment, came. Did He then request, or did He only suggest? But whichever of these it was, certainly it was done by a word, and the Word of God is the Son of God Himself. Wherefore, since the Father sent Him by a word, His being sent was the work of both the Father and His Word; therefore the same Son was sent by the Father and the Son, because the Son Himself is the Word of the Father. For who would embrace so impious an opinion as to think the Father to have uttered a word in time, in order thatthe eternal Son might thereby be sent and might appear in the flesh in the fullness oftime? But assuredly it was in that Word of God itself which was in the beginning with God and was God, namely, in the wisdom itself of God, apart from time, at what time that wisdom must needs appear in the flesh. Therefore, since without any commencement of time, the Word was in the beginning, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, it was in the Word itself without any time, at what time the Word was to be made flesh and dwell among us.[fn-4-P486_174743:32-nf] And when this fullness of time had come, \"God sent His Son, made of a woman,\"[fn-4-P487_174844:33-nf] that is, made in time, that the Incarnate Word might appear to men; while it was in that Word Himself, apart from time, at what time this was to be done; for the order of times is in the eternal wisdom of God without time. Since, then, that the Son should appear in the flesh was wrought by both the Father and the Son, it is fitly said that He who appeared in that flesh was sent, and that He who did not appear in it, sent Him; because those things which are transacted outwardly before the bodily eyes have their existence from the inward structure (apparatu) of the spiritual nature, and on that account are filly said to be sent. Further, that form of man which He took is the person of the Son, not also of the Father; on which account the invisible Father, together with the Son, who with the Father is invisible, is said to have sent the same Son by making Him visible. But if He became visible in such way as to cease to be invisible with the Father, that is, if the substance of the invisible Word were turned by a change and transition into a visible creature, then the Son would be so understood to be sent by the Father, that He would be found to be only sent; not also, with the Father, sending. But since He so took the form of a servant, as that the unchangeable form of God remained, it is clear that that which became apparent in the Son was done by the Father and the Son not being apparent; that is, that by the invisible Father, with the invisible Son, the same Son Himself was sent so as to be visible. Why, therefore, does He say, \"Neither came I of myself?\" This, we may now say, is said according to the form of a servant, in the same way as it is said, \"I judge no man.\"[fn-4-P488_176558:34-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"327","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"17. Let your companions be women pale and thin with fasting, and approved by their years and conduct; such as daily sing in their hearts: \"Tell me where thou feedest thy flock, where thou makest it to rest at noon,\"[fn-7-P710_141483:437-nf] and say, with true earnestness, \"I have a desire to depart and to be with Christ.\"[fn-7-P711_141590:438-nf] Be subject to your parents, imitating the example of your spouse.[fn-7-P712_141676:439-nf] Rarely go abroad, and if you wish to seek, the aid of the martyrs seek it in your own chamber. For you will never need a pretext for going out if you always go out when there is need. Take food in moderation, and never overload your stomach. For many women, while temperate as regards wine, are intemperate in the use of food. When you rise at night to pray, let your breath be that of an empty and not that of an overfull stomach. Read often, learn all that you can. Let sleep overcome you, the roll still in your hands; when your head falls, let it be on the sacred page. Let your fasts be of daily occurrence and your refreshment such as avoids satiety. It is idle to carry an empty stomach if, in two or three days' time, the fast is to be made up for by repletion. When cloyed the mind immediately grows sluggish, and when the ground is watered it puts forth the thorns of lust. If ever you feel the outward man sighing for the flower of youth, and if, as you lie on your couch after a meal, you are excited by the alluring train of sensual desires; then seize the shield of faith, for it alone can quench the fiery darts of the devil.[fn-7-P713_142837:440-nf] \"They are all adulterers,\" says the prophet; \"they have made ready their heart like an oven.\"[fn-7-P714_142951:441-nf] But do you keep close to the footsteps of Christ, and, intent upon His words, say: \"Did not our heart burn within us by the way while Jesus opened to us the Scriptures?\"[fn-7-P715_143159:442-nf] and again: \"Thy word is tried to the uttermost, and thy servant loveth it.\"[fn-7-P716_143257:443-nf] It is hard for the human soul to avoid loving something, and our mind must of necessity give way to affection of one kind or another. The love of the flesh is overcome by the love of the spirit. Desire is quenched by desire. What is taken from the one increases the other. Therefore, as you lie on your couch, say again and again: \"By night have I sought Him whom my soul loveth.\"[fn-7-P717_143667:444-nf] \"Mortify, therefore,\" says the apostle, \"your members which are upon the earth.\"[fn-7-P718_143769:445-nf] Because he himself did so, he could afterwards say with confidence: \"I live, yet not I, but Christ, liveth in me.\"[fn-7-P719_143904:446-nf] He who mortifies his members, and feels that he is walking in a vain show,[fn-7-P720_143999:447-nf] is not afraid to say: \"I am become like a bottle in the frost.[fn-7-P721_144134:448-nf] Whatever there was in me of the moisture of lust has been dried out of me.\" And again: \"My knees are weak through fasting; I forget to eat my bread.

All that was due to him you can give to them. Temper grief with love, for if he is gone they are still with you. It is no small merit in God's eyes to bring up children well. Hear the apostle's counsel: \"Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man, well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.\"[fn-33-P3355_880507:2435-nf] Here you learn the roll of the virtues which God requires of you, what is due to the name of widow which you bear, and by what good deeds you can attain to that second degree of chastity[fn-33-P3356_880730:2436-nf] which is still open to you. Do not be disturbed because the apostle allows none to be chosen as a widow under threescore years old, neither suppose that he intends to reject those who are still young. Believe that you are indeed chosen by him who said to his disciple, \"Let no man despise thy youth,\"[fn-33-P3357_881114:2437-nf] your want of age that is, not your want of continence. If this be not his meaning, all who become widows under threescore years will have to take husbands. He is training a church still untaught in Christ, and making provision for people of all stations but especially for the poor, the charge of whom had been committed to himself and Barnabas.[fn-33-P3358_881484:2438-nf] Thus he wishes only those to be supported by the exertions of the church who cannot labour with their own hands, and who are widows indeed,[fn-33-P3359_881658:2439-nf] approved by their years and by their lives. The faults of his children made Eli the priest an offence to God. On the other hand He is appeased by the virtues of such as \"continue in faith and charity and holiness with chastity.\"[fn-33-P3360_881913:2440-nf] \"O Timothy,\" cries the apostle, \"keep thyself pure.\"[fn-33-P3361_882029:2441-nf] Far be it from me to suspect you capable of doing anything wrong; still it is only a kindness to admonish one whose youth and opulence lead her into temptation. You must take what I am going to say as addressed not to you but to your girlish years. A widow \"that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.\"[fn-33-P3362_882361:2442-nf] So speaks the \"chosen vessel\"[fn-33-P3363_882413:2443-nf] and the words are brought out from his treasure who could boldly say: \"Do ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me?\"[fn-33-P3364_882552:2444-nf] Yet they are the words of one who in his own person admitted the weakness of the human body, saying: \"The good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not that I do.\"[fn-33-P3365_882760:2445-nf] And again: Therefore \"I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a castaway.\"[fn-33-P3366_882941:2446-nf] If Paul is afraid, which of us can venture to be confident? If David the friend of God and Solomon who loved God[fn-33-P3367_883078:2447-nf] were overcome like other men, if their fall is meant to warn us and their penitence to lead us to salvation, who in this slippery life can be sure of not falling? Never let pheasants be seen upon your table, or plump turtledoves or black cock from Ionia, or any of those birds so expensive that they fly away with the largest properties. And do not fancy that you eschew meat diet when you reject pork, hare, and venison and the savoury flesh of other quadrupeds.[fn-33-P3368_883564:2448-nf] It is not the number of feet that makes the difference but delicacy of flavour. I know that the apostle has said: \"every creature of God is good and nothing to be refused if it be received with thanksgiving.\"[fn-33-P3369_883906:2449-nf] But the same apostle says: \"it is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine,\"[fn-33-P3370_884009:2450-nf] and in another place: \"be not drunk with wine wherein is excess.\"[fn-33-P3371_884098:2451-nf] \"Every creature of God is good\"-the precept is intended for those who are careful how they may please their husbands.[fn-33-P3372_884237:2452-nf] Let those feed on flesh who serve the flesh, whose bodies boil with desire, who are tied to husbands, and who set their hearts on having offspring. Let those whose wombs are burthened cram their stomachs with flesh. But you have buried every indulgence in your husband's tomb: over his bier you have cleansed with tears a face stained with rouge and whitelead; you have exchanged a white robe and gilded buskins for a sombre tunic and black shoes; and only one thing more is needed, perseverance in fasting. Let paleness and squalor be henceforth your jewels. Do not pamper your youthful limbs with a bed of down or kindle your young blood with hot baths.

He is training a church still untaught in Christ, and making provision for people of all stations but especially for the poor, the charge of whom had been committed to himself and Barnabas.[fn-33-P3358_881484:2438-nf] Thus he wishes only those to be supported by the exertions of the church who cannot labour with their own hands, and who are widows indeed,[fn-33-P3359_881658:2439-nf] approved by their years and by their lives. The faults of his children made Eli the priest an offence to God. On the other hand He is appeased by the virtues of such as \"continue in faith and charity and holiness with chastity.\"[fn-33-P3360_881913:2440-nf] \"O Timothy,\" cries the apostle, \"keep thyself pure.\"[fn-33-P3361_882029:2441-nf] Far be it from me to suspect you capable of doing anything wrong; still it is only a kindness to admonish one whose youth and opulence lead her into temptation. You must take what I am going to say as addressed not to you but to your girlish years. A widow \"that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.\"[fn-33-P3362_882361:2442-nf] So speaks the \"chosen vessel\"[fn-33-P3363_882413:2443-nf] and the words are brought out from his treasure who could boldly say: \"Do ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me?\"[fn-33-P3364_882552:2444-nf] Yet they are the words of one who in his own person admitted the weakness of the human body, saying: \"The good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not that I do.\"[fn-33-P3365_882760:2445-nf] And again: Therefore \"I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a castaway.\"[fn-33-P3366_882941:2446-nf] If Paul is afraid, which of us can venture to be confident? If David the friend of God and Solomon who loved God[fn-33-P3367_883078:2447-nf] were overcome like other men, if their fall is meant to warn us and their penitence to lead us to salvation, who in this slippery life can be sure of not falling? Never let pheasants be seen upon your table, or plump turtledoves or black cock from Ionia, or any of those birds so expensive that they fly away with the largest properties. And do not fancy that you eschew meat diet when you reject pork, hare, and venison and the savoury flesh of other quadrupeds.[fn-33-P3368_883564:2448-nf] It is not the number of feet that makes the difference but delicacy of flavour. I know that the apostle has said: \"every creature of God is good and nothing to be refused if it be received with thanksgiving.\"[fn-33-P3369_883906:2449-nf] But the same apostle says: \"it is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine,\"[fn-33-P3370_884009:2450-nf] and in another place: \"be not drunk with wine wherein is excess.\"[fn-33-P3371_884098:2451-nf] \"Every creature of God is good\"-the precept is intended for those who are careful how they may please their husbands.[fn-33-P3372_884237:2452-nf] Let those feed on flesh who serve the flesh, whose bodies boil with desire, who are tied to husbands, and who set their hearts on having offspring. Let those whose wombs are burthened cram their stomachs with flesh. But you have buried every indulgence in your husband's tomb: over his bier you have cleansed with tears a face stained with rouge and whitelead; you have exchanged a white robe and gilded buskins for a sombre tunic and black shoes; and only one thing more is needed, perseverance in fasting. Let paleness and squalor be henceforth your jewels. Do not pamper your youthful limbs with a bed of down or kindle your young blood with hot baths.

What darkness, what raging madness rushing to its own destruction! You say that the mother of the Lord was present at the cross, you say that she was entrusted to the disciple John on account of her widowhood and solitary condition: as if upon your own showing, she had not four sons, and numerous daughters, with whose solace she might comfort herself? You also apply to her the name of widow which is not found in Scripture. And although you quote all instances in the Gospels, the words of John alone displease you. You say in passing that she was present at the cross, that you may not appear to have omitted it on purpose, and yet not a word about the women who were with her. I could pardon you if you were ignorant, but I see you have a reason for your silence. Let me point out then what John says,[fn-60-P6065_1805100:50-nf] \"But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.\" No one doubts that there were two apostles called by the name James, James the son of Zebedee, and James the son of Alphaeus. Do you intend the comparatively unknown James the less, who is called in Scripture the son of Mary, not however of Mary the mother of our Lord, to be an apostle, or not? If he is an apostle, he must be the son of Alphaeus and a believer in Jesus, \"For neither did his brethren believe in him.\" If he is not an apostle, but a third James (who he can be I cannot tell), how can he be regarded as the Lord's brother, and how, being a third, can he be called less to distinguish him from greater, when greater and less are used to denote the relations existing, not between three, but between two? Notice, moreover, that the Lord's brother is an apostle, since Paul says,[fn-60-P6066_1806046:51-nf] \"Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days. But other of the Apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.\" And in the same Epistle,[fn-60-P6067_1806269:52-nf] \"And when they perceived the grace that was given unto me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars,\" etc. And that you may not suppose this James to be the son of Zebedee, you have only to read the Acts of the Apostles, and you will find that the latter had already been slain by Herod. The only conclusion is that the Mary who is described as the mother of James the less was the wife of Alphaeus and sister of Mary the Lord's mother, the one who is called by John the Evangelist \"Mary of Clopas,\" whether after her father, or kindred, or for some other reason. But if you think they are two persons because elsewhere we read, \"Mary the mother of James the less,\" and here, \"Mary of Clopas,\" you have still to learn that it is customary in Scripture for the same individual to bear different names. Raguel, Moses' father-in-law, is also called Jethro. Gedeon,[fn-60-P6068_1807165:53-nf] without any apparent reason for the change, all at once becomes Jerubbaal. Ozias, king of Judah, has an alternative, Azarias. Mount Tabor is called Itabyrium. Again Hermon is called by the Phenicians Sanior, and by the Amorites Sanir. The same tract of country is known by three names,[fn-60-P6069_1807478:54-nf] Negebh, Teman, and Darom in Ezekiel. Peter is also called Simon and Cephas.

For \"if righteousness is by the law, then Christ has died in vain.\"[fn-16-P1671_756613:262-nf] Seeing, however, that if He has not died in vain, He has ascended up on high, and has led captivity captive, and has given gifts to men,[fn-16-P1672_756770:263-nf] it follows that whosoever has, has from this source. But whosoever denies that he has from Him, either has not, or is in great danger of being deprived of what he has.[fn-16-P1673_756973:264-nf] \"For it is one God which justifies the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith;\"[fn-16-P1674_757105:265-nf] in which clauses there is no real difference in the sense, as if the phrase \"by faith\" meant one thing, and \"through faith\" another, but only a variety of expression. For in one passage, when speaking of the Gentiles,-that is, of the uncircumcision,-he says, \"The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen by faith;\"[fn-16-P1675_757458:266-nf] and again, in another, when speaking of the circumcision, to which he himself belonged, he says, \"We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed in Jesus Christ.\"[fn-16-P1676_757767:267-nf] Observe, he says that both the uncircumcision are justified by faith, and the circumcision through faith, if, indeed, the circumcision keep the righteousness of faith. For the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith,[fn-16-P1677_758210:268-nf] -by obtaining it of God, not by assuming it of themselves. But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness. And why? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by works[fn-16-P1678_758465:269-nf] -in other words, working it out as it were by themselves, not believing that it is God who works within them. \"For it is God which worketh in us both to will and to do of His own good pleasure.\"[fn-16-P1679_758684:270-nf] And hereby \"they stumbled at the stumbling-stone.\"[fn-16-P1680_758756:271-nf] For what he said, \"not by faith, but as it were by works,\"[fn-16-P1681_758835:272-nf] he most clearly explained in the following words: \"They, being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.\"[fn-16-P1682_759147:273-nf] Then are we still in doubt what are those works of the law by which a man is not justified, if he believes them to be his own works, as it were, without the help and gift of God, which is \"by the faith of Jesus Christ?\" And do we suppose that they are circumcision and the other like ordinances, because some such things in other passages are read concerning these sacramental rites too? In this place, however, it is certainly not circumcision which they wanted to establish as their own righteousness, because God established this by prescribing it Himself. Nor is it possible for us to understand this statement, of those works concerning which the Lord says to them, \"Ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition;\"[fn-16-P1683_759912:274-nf] because, as the apostle says, Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.\"[fn-16-P1684_760065:275-nf] He did not say, Which followed after their own traditions, framing them and relying on them. This then is the sole distinction, that the very precept, \"Thou shalt not covet,\"[fn-16-P1685_760260:276-nf] and God's other good and holycommandments, they attributed to themselves; whereas, that man may keep them, God must work in him through faith in Jesus Christ, who is \"the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.\"[fn-16-P1686_760513:277-nf] That is to say, every one who is incorporated into Him and made a member of His body, is able, by His giving the increase within, to work righteousness.

These persons also believe in God; for if they had no faith in Him at all, neither would they of course have any dread of the penalty of His law. This, however, is not the faith which the apostle commends. He says: \"Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.\"[fn-17-P1735_774857:308-nf] The fear, then, of which we speak is slavish; and therefore, even though there be in it a belief in the Lord, yet righteousness is not loved by it, but condemnation is feared. God's children, however, exclaim, \"Abba, Father,\"-one of which words they of the circumcision utter; the other, they of the uncircumcision,-the Jew first, and then the Greek;[fn-17-P1736_775230:309-nf] since there is \"one God, which justifieth the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.\"[fn-17-P1737_775357:310-nf] When indeed they utter this call, they seek something; and what do they seek, but that which they hunger and thirst after? And what else is this but that which is said of them, \"Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled?\"[fn-17-P1738_775648:311-nf] Let, then, those who are under the law pass over hither, and become sons instead of slaves; and yet not so as to cease to be slaves, but so as, while they are sons, still to serve their Lord and Father freely. For even this have they received; for the Only-begotten \"gave them power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name;\"[fn-17-P1739_776017:312-nf] and He advised them to ask, to seek, and to knock, in order to receive, to find, and to have the gate opened to them,[fn-17-P1740_776154:313-nf] adding by way of rebuke, the words : \"If ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him?\"[fn-17-P1741_776373:314-nf] When, therefore, that strength of sin, the law,[fn-17-P1742_776443:315-nf] inflamed the sting of death, even sin, to take occasion and by the commandment work all manner of concupiscence in them,[fn-17-P1743_776586:316-nf] of whom were they to ask for the gift of continence but of Him who knows how to give good gifts to His children? Perhaps, however, a man, in his folly, is unaware that no one can be continent except God give him the gift. To know this, indeed, he requires Wisdom herself.[fn-17-P1744_776878:317-nf] Why, then, does he not listen to the Spirit of his Father, speaking through Christ's apostle, or even Christ Himself, who says in His gospel, \"Seek and ye shall find; \"[fn-17-P1745_777070:318-nf] and who also says to us, speaking by His apostle: \"If any one of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given to him. Let him, however, ask in faith, nothing wavering? \"[fn-17-P1746_777329:319-nf] This is the faith by which the just man lives;[fn-17-P1747_777397:320-nf] this is the faith whereby he believes on Him who justifies the ungodly;[fn-17-P1748_777488:321-nf] this is the faith through which boasting is excluded,[fn-17-P1749_777561:322-nf] either by the retreat of that with which we become self-inflated, or by the rising of that with which we glory in the Lord. This, again, is the faith by which we procure that largess of the Spirit, of which it is said: \"We indeed through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.\"[fn-17-P1750_777877:323-nf] But this admits of the further question, Whether he meant by \"the hope of righteousness\" that by which righteousness hopes, or that whereby righteousness is itself hoped for? For the just man, who lives by faith, hopes undoubtedly for eternal life; and the faith likewise, which hungers and thirsts for righteousness, makes progress therein by the renewal of the inward man day by day,[fn-17-P1751_778281:324-nf] and hopes to be satiated therewith in that eternal life, where shall be realized that which is said of God by the psalm: \"Who satisfieth thy desire with good things.\"[fn-17-P1752_778470:325-nf] This, moreover, is the faith whereby they are saved to whom it is said: \"By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.\"[fn-17-P1753_778822:326-nf] This, in short, is the faith which works not by fear, but by love;[fn-17-P1754_778910:327-nf] not by dreading punishment, but by loving righteousness. Whence, therefore, arises this love,-that is to say, this charity,-by which faith works, if not from the source whence faith itself obtained it? For it would not be within us, to what extent soever it is in us, if it were not diffused in our hearts by the Holy Ghost who is given to us.[fn-17-P1755_779272:328-nf] Now \"the love of God\" is said to be shed abroad in our hearts, not because He loves us, but because He makes us lovers of Himself; just as \"the righteousness of God\"[fn-17-P1756_779456:329-nf] is used in the sense of our being made righteous by His gift; and \"the salvation of the Lord,\"[fn-17-P1757_779572:330-nf] in that we are saved by Him; and \"the faith of Jesus Christ,\"[fn-17-P1758_779653:331-nf] because He makes us believers in Him.

But why do we argue, and why are we eager to frame a clever and victorious reply to our opponent?[fn-64-P6431_1986755:262-nf] \"Old things have passed away, behold all things have become new.\" I will run through the utterances of the Apostles, and as to the instances afforded by Solomon I added short expositions to facilitate their being understood, so now I will go over the passages bearing on Christian purity and continence, and will make of many proofs a connected series. By this method I shall succeed in omitting nothing relating to chastity, and shall avoid being tediously long. Amongst other passages, Paul the Apostle writes to the Romans:[fn-64-P6432_1987303:263-nf] \"What fruit then had ye at that time in the things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death. But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life.\" I suppose too that the end of marriage is death. But the compensating fruit of sanctification, fruit belonging either to virginity or to continence, is eternal life. And afterwards:[fn-64-P6433_1987764:264-nf] \"Wherefore, my brethren, ye also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ; that ye should be joined to another, even to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit unto God. For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were through the law, wrought in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that wherein we were holden; so that we serve in newness of the Spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.\" \"When,\" he says, \"we were in the flesh, and not in the newness of the Spirit but in the oldness of the letter,\" we did those things which pertained to the flesh, and bore fruit unto death. But now because we are dead to the law, through the body of Christ, let us bear fruit to God, that we may belong to Him who rose from the dead. And elsewhere, having previously said,[fn-64-P6434_1988671:265-nf] \"I know that the law is spiritual,\" and having discussed at some length the violence of the flesh which frequently drives us to do what we would not, he at last continues: \"O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me out of the body of this death? I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.\" And again, \"So then I myself with the mind serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.\" And,[fn-64-P6435_1989121:266-nf] \"There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and death.\" And more clearly in what follows he teaches that Christians do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit:[fn-64-P6436_1989479:267-nf] \"For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit. For the mind of the flesh is death; but the mind of the spirit is life and peace: because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be: and they that are in the flesh cannot please God. But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you,\" and so on to where he says,[fn-64-P6437_1990011:268-nf] \"So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh: for if ye live after the flesh, ye must die; but if by the spirit ye mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.\" If the[fn-64-P6438_1990318:269-nf] wisdom of the flesh is enmity against God, and they who are in the flesh cannot please God, I think that they who perform the functions of marriage love the wisdom of the flesh, and therefore are in the flesh. The Apostle being desirous to withdraw us from the flesh and to join us to the Spirit, says afterwards:[fn-64-P6439_1990653:270-nf] \"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service. And be not fashioned according to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God. For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think according to chastity\"[fn-64-P6440_1991185:271-nf] (not soberly as the Latin versions badly render), but \"think,\" he says, \"according to chastity,\" for the Greek words are e0ij to swfronein. Let us consider what the Apostle says: \"Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.\" What he says is something like this-God indeed permits marriage, He permits second marriages, and if necessary, prefers even third marriages to fornication and adultery. But we who ought to present our bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is our reasonable service, should consider, not what God permits, but what He wishes: that we may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God. It follows that what He merely permits is neither good, nor acceptable, nor perfect. And he gives his reasons for this advice:[fn-64-P6441_1992056:272-nf] \"Knowing the season, that now it is high time for you to awake out of sleep: for now is salvation nearer to us than when we first believed. The night is far spent, and the day is at hand.\" And lastly: \"Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.\" God's will is one thing, His indulgence another. Whence, writing to the Corinthians, he says,[fn-64-P6442_1992505:273-nf] \"I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able. For ye are yet carnal.\" He who[fn-64-P6443_1992812:274-nf] is in the merely animal state, and does not receive the things pertaining to the Spirit of God (for he is foolish, and cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned), he is not fed with the food of perfect chastity, but with the coarse milk of marriage. As through man came death, so also through man came the resurrection of the dead. As in Adam we all die, so in Christ we shall all be made alive. Under the law we served the old Adam, under the Gospel let us serve the new Adam. For the first man Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.[fn-64-P6444_1993681:275-nf] \"The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is of heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.\" This is so clear that no explanation can make it clearer: \"Flesh and blood,\" he says, \"cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.\" If corruption attaches to all intercourse, and incorruption is characteristic of chastity, the rewards of chastity cannot belong to marriage.[fn-64-P6445_1994423:276-nf] \"For we know that if the earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens. For verily in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our habitation which is from heaven. We are willing to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord. Wherefore also we make it our aim, whether in the body, or out of the body, to be well-pleasing unto God.\" And by way of more fully explaining what he did not wish them to be he says elsewhere:[fn-64-P6446_1994969:277-nf] \"I espoused you to one husband, that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ.\" But if you choose to apply the words to the whole Assembly of believers, and in this betrothal to Christ include both married women, and the twice-married, and widows, and virgins, that also makes for us. For whilst he invites all to chastity and to the reward of virginity, he shows that virginity is more excellent than all these conditions. And again writing to the Galatians he says:[fn-64-P6447_1995465:278-nf] \"Because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.\" Among the works of the law is marriage, and accordingly under it they are cursed who have no children. And if under the Gospel it is permitted to have children, it is one thing to make a concession to weakness another to hold out rewards to virtue.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_12_book_vii_","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"204","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"23 Nay more, the Epistle-for I pass by the Gospel - does not mention nor does it contain any intimation of the Apocalypse, nor does the Apocalypse of the Epistle.

But he had withal said above: \"Are we, then, making void the law through faith? Far be it; but we are establishing the law \"[fn-13-P1360_376068:61-nf] -forsooth in those (points) which, being even now interdicted by the New Testament, are prohibited by an even more emphatic precept: instead of, \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" \"Whoever shall have seen with a view to concupiscence, hath already committed adultery in his own heart; \"[fn-13-P1361_376373:62-nf] and instead of, \"Thou shalt not kill,\" \"Whoever shall have said to his brother, Racha, shall be in danger of hell.\"[fn-13-P1362_376511:63-nf] Ask (yourself) whether the law of not committing adultery be still in force, to which has been added that of not indulging concupiscence. Besides, if any precedents (taken from the Old Dispensation) shall favour you in (the secrecy of) your bosom, they shall not be set in opposition to this discipline which we are maintaining. For it is in vain that an additional law has been reared, condemning the origin even of sins-that is, concupiscences and wills-no less than the actual deeds; if the fact that pardon was of old in some cases conceded to adultery is to be a reason why it shall be conceded at the present day. \"What will be the reward attaching to the restrictions imposed upon the more fully developed discipline of the present day, except that the eider (discipline) may be made the agent for granting indulgence to your prostitution? \"In that case, you will grant pardon to the idolater too, and to every apostate, because we find the People itself, so often guilty of these crimes, as often reinstated in their former privileges.

We, too, indeed have precedents in the self-same antiquity on the side of our opinion,-(precedents) of judgment not merely not waived, but even summarily executed upon fornication. And of course it is a sufficient one, that so vast a number-(the number) of 24, 000-of the People, when they committed fornication with the daughters of Madian, fell in one plague.[fn-13-P1368_378811:69-nf] But, with an eye to the glory of Christ, I prefer to derive (my) discipline from Christ.

And certain it is, that forthwith thereafter the rebuked one indeed trembled beneath the menace of the uplifted rod, but the condemned perished under the instant infliction of the penalty. Immediately the former retreated fearing the blow, the latter paying the penalty. When a letter of the self-same apostle is sent a second time to the Corinthians, pardon is granted plainly; but it is uncertain to whom, because neither person nor cause is advertised. I will compare the cases with the senses. If the \"incestuous\" man is set before us, on the same platform will be the \"inflated\" man too. Surely the analogy, of the case is sufficiently maintained, when the \"inflated\" is rebuked, but the \"incestuous\" is condemned. To the \"inflated\" pardon is granted, but after rebuke; to the \"incestuous\" no pardon seems to have been granted, as under condemnation. If it was to him for whom it was feared that he might be \"devoured by mourning\" that pardon was being granted, the \"rebuked\" one was still in danger of being devoured, losing heart on account of the commination, and mourning on account of the rebuke. The \"condemned\" one, however, was permanently accounted as already devoured, alike by his fault and by his sentence; (accounted, that is, as one) who had not to \"mourn,\" but to suffer that which, before suffering it, he might have mourned. If the reason why pardon was being granted was \"lest we should be defrauded by Satan,\" the loss against which precaution was being taken had to do with that which had not yet perished. No precaution is taken in the use of a thing finally despatched, but in the case of a thing still safe. But the condemned one-condemned, too, to the possession of Satan-had already perished from the Church at the moment when he had committed such a deed, not to say withal at the moment of being forsworn by the Church itself. How should (the Church) fear to suffer a fraudulent loss of him whom she had already lost on his ereption, and whom, after condemnation, she could not have held? Lastly, to what will it be becoming for a judge to grant indulgence? to that which by a formal pronouncement he has decisively settled, or to that which by an interlocutory sentence he has left in suspense?

I suppose, however, that it will become apparent in the subsequent details of these proceedings. Now he says: \"We have affirmed that a man is able to be without sin, and to keep the commandments of God if he wishes, inasmuch as God has given him this ability. But we have not said that any man can be found, who from infancy to old age has never committed sin; but that if any person were converted from his sins, he could by his own exertion and God's grace be without sin; and yet not even thus would he be incapable of change afterwards.\" Now it is quite uncertain what he means in these words by the grace of God; and the judges, catholic as they were, could not possibly understand by the phrase anything else than the grace which is so very strongly recommended to us in the apostle's teaching. Now this is the grace whereby we hope that we can be delivered from the body of this death through our Lord Jesus Christ,[fn-29-P2909_1129529:48-nf] [VII.] and for the obtaining of which we pray that we may not be led into temptation.[fn-29-P2910_1129637:49-nf] This grace is not nature, but that which renders assistance to frail and corrupted nature. This grace is not the knowledge of the law, but is that of which the apostle says: \"I will not make void the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.\"[fn-29-P2911_1129938:50-nf] Therefore it is not \"the letter that killeth, but the life-giving spirit.\"[fn-29-P2912_1130031:51-nf] For the knowledge of the law, without the grace of the Spirit, produces all kinds of concupiscence in man; for, as the apostle says, \"I had not known sin but by the law: I had not known lust, unless the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence.\"[fn-29-P2913_1130379:52-nf] By saying this, however, he blames not the law; he rather praises it, for he says afterwards: \"The law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.\"[fn-29-P2914_1130566:53-nf] And he goes on to ask: \"Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, wrought death in me by that which is good.\"[fn-29-P2915_1130748:54-nf] And, again, he praises the law by saying: \"We know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin. For that which I do I know not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I. If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.\"[fn-29-P2916_1131049:55-nf] Observe, then, he knows the law, praises it, and consents to it; for what it commands, that he also wishes; and what it forbids, and condemns, that he also hates: but for all that, what he hates, that he actually does. There is in his mind, therefore, a knowledge of the holy law of God, but still his evil concupiscence is not cured. He has a good will within him, but still what he does is evil. Hence it comes to pass that, amidst the mutual struggles of the two laws within him,-\"the law in his members warring against the law of his mind, and making him captive to the law of sin,\"[fn-29-P2917_1131658:56-nf] -he confesses his misery; and exclaims in such words as these: \"O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from this body of death?

[XXIII.] For he goes on to say: \"Whosoever makes a right use of this\" (that is, rightly uses his freedom of will), \"does so entirely surrender himself to God, and does so completely mortify his own will, that he is able to say with the apostle, `Nevertheless it is already of I that live, but Christ liveth in me;'[fn-33-P3330_1289399:58-nf] and `He placeth his heart in the hand of God, so that He turneth it whithersoever He willeth.'\"[fn-33-P3331_1289513:59-nf] Great indeed is the help of the grace of God, so that He turns our heart in whatever direction He pleases. But according to this writer's foolish opinion, however great the help may be, we deserve it all at the moment when, without any assistance beyond the liberty of our will, we hasten to the Lord, desire His guidance and direction, suspend our own will entirely on His, and by close adherence to Him become one spirit with Him. Now all these vast courses of goodness we (according to him) accomplish, forsooth, simply by the freedom of our own free will; and by reason of such antecedent merits we so secure His grace, that He turns our heart which way soever He pleases. Well, now, how is that grace which is not gratuitously conferred? How can it be grace, if it is given in payment of a debt? How can that be true which the apostle says, \"It is not of yourselves, but it is the gift of God; not of works, lest any man should boast;\"[fn-33-P3332_1290473:60-nf] and again, \"If it is of grace, then is it no more of works, otherwise grace is no more grace:\"[fn-33-P3333_1290588:61-nf] how, I repeat, can this be true, if such meritorious works precede as to procure for us the bestowal of grace? Surely, under the circumstances, there can be no gratuitous gift, but only the recompense of a due reward. Is it the case, then, that in order to find their way to the help of God, men run to God without God's help? And in order that we may receive God's help while cleaving to Him, do we without His help cleave to God? What greater gift, or even what similar gift, could grace itself bestow upon any man, if he has already without grace been able to make himself one spirit with the Lord by no other power than that of his own free will?","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_21_homily_xv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"78","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"For other men, though they fall never so often, may possibly obtain indulgence: but the teacher, should this happen to him, is deprived of all excuse, and will suffer the most extreme vengeance.

But since now certain who wish to renew the Arian heresy have presumed to set at nought this faith confessed at Nicaea by the Fathers, and while pretending to confess it, do in fact deny it, explaining away the `Coessential[fn-99-P9973_3568232:6-nf] ,' and blaspheming of their own accord[fn-99-P9974_3568338:7-nf] against the Holy Spirit, in affirming that It is a creature, and came into being as a thing made by the Son, we hasten as of bounden duty, in view of the injury resulting to the people from such blasphemy, to hand to your Piety the faith confessed at Nicaea; in order that thy religiousness may know what has been written with all accuracy, and how far wrong they are who teach contrary to it.","title":"Letter LVI.

Accordingly it remains that if we are to believe that the Lord Jesus, in this prayer, prayed for all of His own who either then were or should thereafter be in this life, which is a state of trial upon earth,[fn-35-P3525_1955083:14-nf] we must so understand the expression, \"through their word,\" as to believe that it here signified the word of faith itself which they preached in the world, and that it was called their word because it was primarily and principally preached by them. For it was already in the course of being preached by them in the earth when Paul received that same word of theirs by the revelation of Jesus Christ. Whence also it came about that he compared the Gospel with them, lest by any means he had run, or should run, in vain; and they gave him their right hand because in him also they found, although not given him by them, their own word which they were already preaching, and in which they were now established.[fn-35-P3526_1955990:15-nf] And in regard to this word of the resurrection of Christ, it is said by the same apostle, \"Whether it were I, or they, so we preach, and so ye believed;\"[fn-35-P3527_1956164:16-nf] and again, \"This is the word of faith,\" he says, \"which we preach, that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth that Jesus is the Lord, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\"[fn-35-P3528_1956412:17-nf] And in the Acts of the Apostles we read that in Christ, God hath marked out [the ground of] faith unto all men, in that He hath raised Him from the dead.[fn-35-P3529_1956585:18-nf] Accordingly, this word of faith, because principally and primarily preached by the apostles who adhered to Him, was called their word. Not, however, on that account does it cease to be the word of God because it is called their word; for the same apostle says that the Thessalonians received it from him \"not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God.\"[fn-35-P3530_1956977:19-nf] \"Of God,\" for the very reason that it was freely given by God; but called \"their word,\" because primarily and principally committed to them by God to be preached. In the same way also the thief mentioned above had in the matter of his own faith their word, which was called theirs precisely because the preaching of it primarily and principally pertained to the office they filled. And once more, when murmuring arose among the Grecian widows in reference to the serving of the tables, previous to the time when Paul was brought to the faith of Christ, the reply given by the apostles, who before then had adhered to the Lord, was: \"It is not good that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.\"[fn-35-P3531_1957704:20-nf] Then it was that they provided for the ordination of deacons, that they themselves might not be drawn aside from the duty of preaching the word. Hence that was properly enough called their word which is the word of faith, whereby all, from whatever quarter they had heard it, believed on Christ, or, as yet to hear it, should thereafter believe. In this prayer, therefore, all whom He redeemed, whether then alive or thereafter to live in the flesh, were prayed for by our Redeemer when, praying for the apostles who were then with Him, He also conjoined those who were yet to believe on Him through their word. But what, after such conjunction, He then proceeds to say, must be reserved for discussion in another discourse.","title":"Tractate CIX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_23_letters_of_the_blessed_theodoret_bishop_of_cyrus","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"439","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Let no one then foolishly suppose that the Christ is any other than the only begotten Son.

We lay it down as our first position, that the evangelical Testament[fn-52-P5278_1647262:41-nf] has apostles for its authors,[fn-52-P5279_1647454:42-nf] to whom was assigned by the Lord Himself this office of publishing the gospel. Since, however, there are apostolic[fn-52-P5280_1647826:43-nf] men also,[fn-52-P5281_1647911:44-nf] they are yet not alone, but appear with apostles and after apostles; because the preaching of disciples might be open to the suspicion of an affectation of glory, if there did not accompany it[fn-52-P5282_1648153:45-nf] the authority of the masters, which means that of Christ,[fn-52-P5283_1648231:46-nf] for it was that which made the apostles their masters. Of the apostles, therefore, John and Matthew first instil[fn-52-P5284_1648363:47-nf] faith into us; whilst of apostolic men, Luke and Mark renew it afterwards.[fn-52-P5285_1648454:48-nf] These all start with the same principles of the faith,[fn-52-P5286_1648525:49-nf] so far as relates to the one only God the Creator and His Christ, how that He was born of the Virgin, and came to fulfil[fn-52-P5287_1648666:50-nf] the law and the prophets. Never mind[fn-52-P5288_1648722:51-nf] if there does occur some variation in the order of their narratives, provided that there be agreement in the essential matter[fn-52-P5289_1648862:52-nf] of the faith, in which there is disagreement with Marcion. Marcion, on the other hand, you must know,[fn-52-P5290_1648980:53-nf] ascribes no author to his Gospel, as if it could not be allowed him to affix a title to that from which it was no crime (in his eyes) to subvert[fn-52-P5291_1649140:54-nf] the very body. And here I might now make a stand, and contend that a work ought not to be recognised, which holds not its head erect, which exhibits no consistency, which gives no promise of credibility from the fulness of its title and the just profession of its author. But we prefer to join issue[fn-52-P5292_1649455:55-nf] on every point; nor shall we leave unnoticed[fn-52-P5293_1649515:56-nf] what may fairly be understood to be on our side.[fn-52-P5294_1649583:57-nf] Now, of the authors whom we possess, Marcion seems to have singled out Luke[fn-52-P5295_1649675:58-nf] for his mutilating process.[fn-52-P5296_1649961:59-nf] Luke, however, was not an apostle, but only an apostolic man; not a master, but a disciple, and so inferior to a master-at least as far subsequent to[fn-52-P5297_1650131:60-nf] him as the apostle whom he followed (and that, no doubt, was Paul[fn-52-P5298_1650213:61-nf] ) was subsequent to the others; so that, had Marcion even published his Gospel in the name of St. Paul himself, the single authority of the document,[fn-52-P5299_1650431:62-nf] destitute of all support from preceding authorities, would not be a sufficient basis for our faith. There would be still wanted that Gospel which St. Paul found in existence, to which he yielded his belief, and with which he so earnestly wished his own to agree, that he actually on that account went up to Jerusalem to know and consult the apostles, \"lest he should run, or had been running in vain; \"[fn-53-P5300_1650853:63-nf] in other words, that the faith which he had learned, and the gospel which he was preaching, might be in accordance with theirs. Then, at last, having conferred with the (primitive) authors, and having agreed with them touching the rule of faith, they joined their hands in fellowship, and divided their labours thenceforth in the office of preaching the gospel, so that they were to go to the Jews, and St. Paul to the Jews and the Gentiles. Inasmuch, therefore, as the enlightener of St. Luke himself desired the authority of his predecessors for both his own faith and preaching, how much more may not I require for Luke's Gospel that which was necessary for the Gospel of his master.[fn-53-P5301_1651557:64-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"51","folder":"ANF-03","text":"In the scheme of Marcion, on the contrary,[fn-53-P5306_1652208:66-nf] the mystery[fn-53-P5307_1652239:67-nf] of the Christian religion begins from the discipleship of Luke. Since, however, it was on its course previous to that point, it must have had[fn-53-P5308_1652399:68-nf] its own authentic materials,[fn-53-P5309_1652448:69-nf] by means of which it found its own way down to St. Luke; and by the assistance of the testimony which it bore, Luke himself becomes admissible. Well, but[fn-53-P5310_1652618:70-nf] Marcion, finding the Epistle of Paul to the Galatians (wherein he rebukes even apostles[fn-53-P5311_1652721:71-nf] ) for \"not walking uprightly according to the truth of the gospel,\"[fn-53-P5312_1652814:72-nf] as well as accuses certain false apostles of perverting the gospel of Christ), labours very hard to destroy the character[fn-53-P5313_1653108:73-nf] of those Gospels which are published as genuine[fn-53-P5314_1653169:74-nf] and under the name of apostles, in order, forsooth, to secure for his own Gospel the credit which he takes away from them. But then, even if he censures Peter and John and James, who were thought to be pillars, it is for a manifest reason. They seemed to be changing their company[fn-53-P5315_1653464:75-nf] from respect of persons. And yet as Paul himself \"became all things to all men,\"[fn-53-P5316_1653569:76-nf] that he might gain all, it was possible that Peter also might have betaken himself to the same plan of practising somewhat different from what he taught. And, in like manner, if false apostles also crept in, their character too showed itself in their insisting upon circumcision and the Jewish ceremonies. So that it was not on account of their preaching, but of their conversation, that they were marked by St. Paul, who would with equal impartiality have marked them with censure, if they had erred at all with respect to God the Creator or His Christ. Each several case will therefore have to be distinguished. When Marcion complains that apostles are suspected (for their prevarication and dissimulation) of having even depraved the gospel, he thereby accuses Christ, by accusing those whom Christ chose. If, then, the apostles, who are censured simply for inconsistency of walk, composed the Gospel in a pure form,[fn-53-P5317_1654509:77-nf] but false apostles interpolated their true record; and if our own copies have been made from these,[fn-53-P5318_1654624:78-nf] where will that genuine text[fn-53-P5319_1654679:79-nf] of the apostle's writings be found which has not suffered adulteration? Which was it that enlightened Paul, and through him Luke? It is either completely blotted out, as if by some deluge-being obliterated by the inundation of falsifiers-in which case even Marcion does not possess the true Gospel; or else, is that very edition which Marcion alone possesses the true one, that is, of the apostles? How, then, does that agree with ours, which is said not to be (the work) of apostles, but of Luke? Or else, again, if that which Marcion uses is not to be attributed to Luke simply because it does agree with ours (which, of course,[fn-53-P5320_1655338:80-nf] is, also adulterated in its title), then it is the work of apostles.

So, on this occasion, Moses represents and prefigures the Jewish people as placed under the law.

The testimony of the apostle is clear and decisive on this point, when he says, \"This rock was Christ.\"[fn-16-P1699_949647:27-nf] In the command of God, that the death of the flesh of Moses should take place on the mountain, we see the divine appointment that the carnal doubt of the divinity of Christ should die on Christ's exaltation. As the rock is Christ, so is the mountain. The rock is the fortitude of His humiliation; the mountain the height of His exaltation. For as the apostle says, \"This rock was Christ,\" so Christ Himself says, \"A city set upon an hill cannot be hid,\"[fn-17-P1700_950119:28-nf] showing that He is the hill, and believers the city built upon the glory of His name.

If it was alive when Peter timidly denied Christ, it was dead when he fearlessly preached Him. It was alive in Saul, when, in his aversion to the offense of the cross, he made havoc of the Christian faith, and where but on this mountain had it died, when Paul was able to say, \"I live no longer, but Christ liveth in me?\"[fn-17-P1703_951652:31-nf] ","title":"Book XVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_25_lecture_xix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"6.

But this discussion is perhaps of some force in the schools of philosophers: but we, in order to understand the Apostle of Christ, ought to observe in what manner the Christian books are used to speak; at any rate it is the belief of all of us, to whom to live is Christ, that Man was taken unto Himself by the Word of God, not surely without a rational soul, as certain heretics will have it; and yet we read, \"The Word was made flesh.\"[fn-36-P3617_1708524:33-nf] What is to be here understood by \"flesh,\" but Man? \"And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.\"[fn-36-P3618_1708640:34-nf] What can be understood, but all men? \"Unto Thee shall all flesh come.\"[fn-36-P3619_1708728:35-nf] What is it, but all men? \"Thou hast given unto Him power over all flesh.\"[fn-36-P3620_1708819:36-nf] What is it, but all men? \"Of the works of the Law shall no flesh be justified.\"[fn-36-P3621_1708918:37-nf] What is it, but no man shall be justified?

Hear thou man: walk not thou after man, but after Him Who made man. Fall not thou away from Him Who made thee, even unto thyself.

But whoso liveth not after man, but after God, assuredly liveth not even after himself, because himself also is a man. But he is therefore said also to live after the flesh, when he so lives; because also when the flesh alone hath been named, man is understood, as we have already shown: just as when the soul alone hath been named, man is understood: whence it is said, \"Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers,\"[fn-36-P3625_1710526:41-nf] that is, every man; and, \"Seventy-five souls went down into Egypt with Jacob,\"[fn-36-P3626_1710624:42-nf] that is, seventy-five men.

For what more plain than this? what more clear? He is certainly speaking unto those, who had risen again with Christ, not yet surely in the flesh, but in the mind: whom he calls dead, and on this account the more living: for \"your life,\" saith he, \"is hid with Christ in God.\" Of such dead the speech is: \"But I live, now not I, but there liveth in me Christ.\" They therefore, whose life was hidden in God, are admonished and exhorted to mortify their members, which are upon the earth. For this follows, \"Mortify, therefore, your members, which are upon the earth.\" And, lest any through excess of dullness should think that such are to mortify the members of the body that are seen, straightway opening what it is he saith, \"Fornication,\" saith he, \"uncleanness, passion, evil lust, and covetousness, which is idolatry.\"[fn-37-P3716_1754662:114-nf] But is it so to be believed, that they, who were already dead, and their life hidden with Christ in God, were still committing fornication, were still living in unclean habits and works, were still slaves to passions of evil lust and covetousness? What madman would thus think of such? What, therefore, would he that they mortify, save the motions themselves still living in a certain intrusion[fn-37-P3717_1755077:115-nf] of their own, without the consent of our mind, without the action of the members of the body? And how are they mortified by the work of continence, save when we consent not to them with the mind, nor are the members of the body yielded to them as weapons; and, what is greater, and to be looked to with yet greater watchfulness of continence, our very thought itself, although in a certain way it be touched by their suggestion, and as it were, whisper, yet turns away from these, that it receive not delight from them, and turns to more delightful thoughts of things above: on this account naming them in discourse, that men abide not in them, but flee from them.

But do not imagine that this was because of their high rank: God forbid! it was because of their piety. For that the Scripture mentions their dignified stations, is to show the greatness of their piety; since it is more wonderful when a person being in a position of wealth and power is such as these were. What makes the praise of the former is, his undertaking so long a journey, and this when there was no (festival) season to require it,[fn-9-P953_863129:2-nf] and his reading on his road, and while riding in his chariot, and his beseeching Philip, and numberless other points: and the great praise of the latter is, that he makes alms and prayers, and is a just man, holding such a command. The reason why the writer describes the man so fully, is, that none may say that the Scripture history relates falsehoods: \"Cornelius,\" he says, \"a centurion of the band called the Italian band.\" (v. 1.) A \"band,\" speira, is what we now call a \"numerous.\"[fn-9-P954_864028:3-nf] \"A devout man,\" he says, \"and one that feared God with all his house\" (v. 2): that you may not imagine that it is because of his high station that these things are done.-When Paul was to be brought over, there is no angel, but the Lord Himself: and He does not send him to some great one, but to a very ordinary person:[fn-9-P955_864617:4-nf] but here, on the contrary, He brings the chief Apostle (to these Gentiles), not sends them to him: herein condescending to their weakness, and knowing how such persons need to be treated. As indeed on many occasions we find Christ Himself hasting (to such), as being more infirm. Or (it may be) because (Cornelius) was not able himself to leave his home. But here again is a high commendation of alms, just as was there given by means of Tabitha. \"A devout man,\" it says, \"and one that feared God with all his house.\" Let us hear this, whoever of us neglect them of our own house, whereas this man was careful of his soldiers also. \"And that gave alms,\" it says, \"to all the people.\" Both his doctrines and his life were right. \"He saw in a vision evidently, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.\" (v. 3.) Why does he see the angel? This also was in order to the full assurance of Peter, or rather, not of him, but of the others, the weaker ones. \"At the ninth hour,\" when he was released from his cares and was at quiet, when he was engaged in prayers and compunction. \"And when he looked on him, he was afraid.\" (v. 4.) Observe how what the angel speaks he does not speak immediately, but first rouses and elevates his mind. At the sight, there was fear, but a fear in moderation, just so far as served to fix his attention. Then also the words relieved him of his fear. The fear roused him: the praise mitigated what was unpleasant in the fear. \"Thy prayers,\" saith he, \"and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God. And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter. (v. 5.) Lest they should come to a different person, he designates the man not only by his surname, but by the place. \"And the same,\" saith he, \"is lodging with one Simon a tanner, who hath his house by the seaside.\" (v. 6.) Do you mark how the Apostles, for love of solitude and quiet, affected the retired quarters of the cities? \"With one Simon a tanner:\" how then if it chanced that there was another? Behold, there is another token, his dwelling by the seaside. All three tokens could not possibly coincide (elsewhere). He does not tell him for what purpose, that he may not take off the intense desire, but he leaves him to an eager and longing expectation of what he shall hear. \"And[fn-9-P956_867590:5-nf] when the Angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually; and when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.\" (v. 7, 8.) Do you see, that it is not without purpose that the writer says this? (it shows) that those also \"who waited on him continually\" were such as he. \"And when he had declared the whole matter unto them:\" observe the unassuming character of the man: for he does not say, Call Peter to me: but, in order also to induce him to come, he declared the whole matter:-this was so ordered by Providence;-for he did not choose to use the authority of his rank to fetch Peter to him; therefore \"he declared the matter;\" such was the moderation of the man: and yet no great notion was to be formed of one lodging with a tanner. \"And on the morrow, as they journeyed, and drew nigh to the city\" (v. 9.)-observe how the Spirit connects the times: no sooner than this, and no later, He Causes this to take place-\" Peter about the sixth hour went up upon the housetop to pray:\" that is, privately and quietly, as in an upper chamber. \"And he became very hungry, and would have eaten; but while they made ready, there fell upon him a trance.\" (v. 10.)

And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common. This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.\" (v. 11-16.) What is this? It is a symbol of the whole world. The[fn-9-P958_872580:7-nf] man was uncircumcised: and -for he had nothing in common with the Jews-they would all accuse him as a transgressor: \"thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them: (ch. xi. 3).\" this[fn-9-P959_874271:8-nf] was a thing altogether offensive to them: observe then what is providentially managed. He himself also says, \"I have never eaten:\" not being himself afraid-far be the thought from us-but it is so contrived by the Spirit, in order that he may have it to say in answer to those accusing him, that he did object: for it was altogether necessary for them to observe the Law. He was in the act of being sent to the Gentiles: therefore that these also may not accuse him, see how many things are contrived (by the Providence of God). For, that it may not seem to be a mere fancy, \"this was done thrice.

Wherefore[fn-9-P962_879292:11-nf] did he object? That none may say that God was proving him, as in the case of Abraham, this is why he says, \"Not so, Lord,\" etc. not gainsaying-just as to Philip also He said, \"How many loaves have ye?\" Not to learn, but tempting, or \"proving him.\"[fn-9-P963_881091:12-nf] And yet it was the same (Lord) that had discoursed above (in the Law) concerning things clean and unclean. But in that sheet were also all the four-footed beasts of the earth:\" the clean with the unclean. And[fn-9-P964_882302:13-nf] for all this, he knew not what it meant. \"Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate, and called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there. But while Peter,\" it says, \"doubted in himself\" (v. 17, 18), the men come at the right moment to solve his doubt: just as (the Lord) suffered Joseph first to be perturbed in mind, and then sends the Angel: for the soul with ease accepts the solution, when it has first been in perplexity. His perplexity neither lasts long (when it did occur), nor (did it occur) before this, but just at the moment when they \"asked whether he were lodging there.

What God doth, this the Spirit is said to do. Not so the Angel, but having first said, \"Thy prayers and thine alms have ascended, for a memorial before God,\" to show that he is sent from thence, then he adds, \"And now send men,\" etc.: the Spirit not so, but, \"For I have sent them.

The object, therefore, of the faith whereby the just man shall live, will be that same God to whom likewise belongs the law, by doing which no man is justified. Since, then, there equally are found the curse in the law and the blessing in faith, you have both conditions set forth by[fn-72-P7263_2100163:114-nf] the Creator: \"Behold,\" says He, \"I have set before you a blessing and a curse.\"[fn-72-P7264_2100256:115-nf] You cannot establish a diversity of authors because there happens to be one of things; for the diversity is itself proposed by one and the same author. Why, however, \"Christ was made a curse for us,\"[fn-72-P7265_2100477:116-nf] is declared by the apostle himself in a way which quite helps our side, as being the result of the Creator's appointment. But yet it by no means follows, because the Creator said of old, \"Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree,\"[fn-72-P7266_2100731:117-nf] that Christ belonged to another god, and on that account was accursed even then in the law. And how, indeed, could the Creator have cursed by anticipation one whom He knew not of? Why, however, may it not be more suitable for the Creator to have delivered His own Son to His own curse, than to have submitted Him to the malediction of that god of yours,-in behalf, too, of man, who is an alien to him? Now, if this appointment of the Creator respecting His Son appears to you to be a cruel one, it is equally so in the case of your own god; if, on the contrary, it be in accordance with reason in your god, it is equally so-nay, much more so-in mine. For it would be more credible that that God had provided blessing for man, through the curse of Christ, who formerly set both a blessing and a curse before man, than that he had done so, who, according to you,[fn-72-P7267_2101673:118-nf] never at any time pronounced either. \"We have received therefore, the promise of the Spirit,\" as the apostle says, \"through faith,\" even that faith by which the just man lives, in accordance with the Creator's purpose.[fn-72-P7268_2101908:119-nf] What I say, then, is this, that that God is the object of faith who prefigured the grace of faith. But when he also adds, \".For ye are all the children of faith,\"[fn-72-P7269_2102148:120-nf] it becomes dear that what the heretic's industry erased was the mention of Abraham's name; for by faith the apostle declares us to be \"children of Abraham,\"[fn-72-P7270_2102326:121-nf] and after mentioning him he expressly called us \"children of faith\" also. But how are we children of faith? and of whose faith, if not Abraham's? For since \"Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness; \"[fn-72-P7271_2102581:122-nf] since, also, he deserved for that reason to be called \"the father of many nations,\" whilst we, who are even more like him[fn-72-P7272_2102723:123-nf] in believing in God, are thereby justified as Abraham was, and thereby also obtain life-since the just lives by his faith,-it therefore happens that, as he in the previous passage called us \"sons of Abraham,\" since he is in faith our (common) father,[fn-72-P7273_2103072:124-nf] so here also he named us \"children of faith,\" for it was owing to his faith that it was promised that Abraham should be the father of (many) nations. As to the fact itself of his calling off faith from circumcision, did he not seek thereby to constitute us the children of Abraham, who had believed previous to his circumcision in the flesh?[fn-72-P7274_2103435:125-nf] In short,[fn-72-P7275_2103475:126-nf] faith in one of two gods cannot possibly admit us to the dispensation[fn-72-P7276_2103561:127-nf] of the other,[fn-72-P7277_2103615:128-nf] so that it should impute righteousness to those who believe in him, and make the just live through him, and declare the Gentiles to be his children through faith. Such a dispensation as this belongs wholly to Him through whose appointment it was already made known by the call of this self-same Abraham, as is conclusively shown[fn-72-P7278_2103978:129-nf] ' by the natural meaning.[fn-72-P7279_2104023:130-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":19,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Since my little work is approaching its termination,[fn-77-P7777_2219354:594-nf] I must treat but briefly the points which still occur, whilst those which have so often turned up must be put aside. I regret still to have to contend about the law-after I have so often proved that its replacement (by the gospel)[fn-77-P7778_2219605:595-nf] affords no argument for another god, predicted as it was indeed in Christ, and in the Creator's own plans[fn-77-P7779_2219732:596-nf] ordained for His Christ. (But I must revert to that discussion) so far as (the apostle leads me, for) this very epistle looks very much as if it abrogated[fn-77-P7780_2219910:597-nf] the law. We have, however, often shown before now that God is declared by the apostle to be a Judge; and that in the Judge is implied an Avenger; area in the Avenger, the Creator. And so in the passage where he says: \"I am not ashamed of the gospel (of Christ): for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that beheveth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek; for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith,\"[fn-77-P7781_2220372:598-nf] he undoubtedly ascribes both the gospel and salvation to Him whom (in accordance with our heretic's own distinction) I have called the just God, not the good one. It is He who removes (men) from confidence in the law to faith in the gospel-that is to say,[fn-77-P7782_2220651:599-nf] His own law and His own gospel.

Of the Creator certainly. The truth, therefore, will be His, whose is also the wrath, which has to be revealed to avenge the truth. Likewise, when adding, \"We are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth,\"[fn-77-P7784_2221131:601-nf] he both vindicated that wrath from which comes this judgment for the truth, and at the same time afforded another proof that the truth emanates from the same God whose wrath he attested, by witnessing to His judgment. Marcion's averment is quite a different matter, that[fn-77-P7785_2221421:602-nf] the Creator in anger avenges Himself on the truth of the rival god which had been detained in unrighteousness. But what serious gaps Marcion has made in this epistle especially, by withdrawing whole passages at his will, will be clear from the unmutilated text of our own copy.[fn-77-P7786_2221720:603-nf] It is enough for my purpose to accept in evidence of its truth what he has seen fit to leave unerased, strange instances as they are also of his negligence and blindness. If, then, God will judge the secrets of men-both of those who have sinned in the law, and of those who have sinned without law (inasmuch as they who know not the law yet do by nature the things contained in the law)[fn-77-P7787_2222134:604-nf] -surely the God who shall judge is He to whom belong both the law, and that nature which is the rule[fn-77-P7788_2222258:605-nf] to them who know not the law. But how will He conduct this judgment? \"According to my gospel,\" says (the apostle), \"by (Jesus) Christ.\"[fn-77-P7789_2222457:606-nf] So that both the gospel and Christ must be His, to whom appertain the law and the nature which are to be vindicated by the gospel and Christ-even at that judgment of God which, as he previously said, was to be according to truth.[fn-77-P7790_2222707:607-nf] The wrath, therefore, which is to vindicate truth, can only be revealed from heaven by the God of wrath;[fn-77-P7791_2222831:608-nf] so that this sentence, which is quite in accordance with that previous one wherein the judgment is declared to be the Creator's,[fn-77-P7792_2222979:609-nf] cannot possibly be ascribed to another god who is not a judge, and is incapable of wrath. It is only consistent in Him amongst whose attributes are found the judgment and the wrath of which I am speaking, and to whom of necessity must also appertain the media whereby these attributes are to be carried into effect. even the gospel and Christ. Hence his invective against the transgressors of the law, who teach that men should not steal, and yet practise theft themselves.[fn-77-P7793_2223503:610-nf] (This invective he utters) in perfect homage[fn-77-P7794_2223568:611-nf] to the law of God, not as if he meant to ten sure the Creator Himself with having commanded[fn-77-P7795_2223676:612-nf] a fraud to be practised against the Egyptians to get their gold and silver at the very time when He was forbidding men to steal,[fn-77-P7796_2223825:613-nf] -adopting such methods as they are apt (shamelessly) to charge upon Him in other particulars also.

Surely, then, the law was His, whose is now the righteousness of God. It is a distinction of dispensations, not of gods. He enjoins those who are justified by faith in Christ and not by the law to have peace with God.[fn-78-P7806_2225935:623-nf] With what God? Him whose enemies we have never, in any dispensation,[fn-78-P7807_2227095:624-nf] been? Or Him against whom we have rebelled, both in relation to His written law and His law of nature?

Corresponding to this change in words is the change which naturally took place in the substitution of new sacraments instead of those of the Old Testament. In the case of the first Christians, who came to the faith as Jews, it was by degrees that they were brought to change their customs, and to have a clear perception of the truth; and permission was given them by the apostle to preserve their hereditary worship and belief, in which they had been born and brought up; and those who had to do with them were required to make allowance for this reluctance to accept new customs. So the apostle circumcised Timothy, the son of a Jewish mother and a Greek father, when they went among people of this kind; and he himself accommodated his practice to theirs, not hypocritically, but for a wise purpose. For these practices were harmless in the case of those born and brought up in them, though they were no longer required to prefigure things to come. It would have done more harm to condemn them as hurtful in the case of those to whose time it was intended that they should continue. Christ, who came to fulfill all these prophecies, found those people trained in their own religion. But in the case of those who had no such training, but were brought to Christ, the corner-stone, from the opposite wall of circumcision, there was no obligation to adopt Jewish customs. If, indeed, like Timothy, they chose to accommodate themselves to the views of those of the circumcision who were still wedded to their old sacraments, they were free to do so. But if they supposed that their hope and salvation depended on these works of the law, they were warned against them as a fatal danger. So the apostle says: \"Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing;\"[fn-18-P1862_1049308:35-nf] that is, if they were circumcised, as they were intending to be, in compliance with some corrupt teachers, who told them that without these works of the law they could not be saved. For when, chiefly through the preaching of the Apostle Paul, the Gentiles were coming to the faith of Christ, as it was proper that they should come, without being burdened with Jewish observances-for those who were grown up were deterred from the faith by fear of ceremonies to which they were not accustomed, especially of circumcision; and if they who had not been trained from their birth to such observances had been made proselytes in the usual way, it would have implied that the coming of Christ still required to be predicted as a future event;-when, then, the Gentiles were admitted without these ceremonies, those of the circumcision who believed, not understanding why the Gentiles were not required to adopt their customs, nor why they themselves were still allowed to retain them, began to disturb the Church with carnal contentions. because the Gentiles were admitted into the people of God without being made proselytes in the usual way by circumcision and the other legal observances. Some also of the converted Gentiles were bent on these ceremonies, from fear of the Jews among whom they lived. Against these Gentiles the Apostle Paul often wrote, and when Peter was carried away by their hypocrisy, he corrected him with a brotherly rebuke.[fn-18-P1863_1050767:36-nf] Afterwards, when the apostles met in council, decreed that these works of the law were not obligatory in the case of the Gentiles,[fn-18-P1864_1050916:37-nf] some Christians of the circumcision were displeased, because they failed to understand that these observances were permissible only in those who had been trained in them before the revelation of faith, to bring to a close the prophetic life in those who were engaged in it before the prophecy was fulfilled, lest by a compulsory abandonment it should seem to be condemned rather than closed; while to lay these things on the Gentiles would imply either that they were not instituted to prefigure Christ, or that Christ was still to be prefigured. The ancient people of God, before Christ came to fulfill the law and the prophets, were required to observe all these things by which Christ was prefigured. It was freedom to those who understood the meaning of the observance, but it was bondage to those who did not. But the people in those latter times who come to believe in Christ as having already come, and suffered, and risen, in the case of those whom this faith found trained to those sacraments, are neither required to observe them, nor prohibited from doing so; while there is a prohibition in the case of those who were not bound by the ties of custom, or by any necessity, to accommodate themselves to the practice of others, so that it might become manifest that these things were instituted to prefigure Christ, and that after His coming they were to cease, because the promises had been fulfilled. Some believers of the circumcision who did not understand this were displeased with this tolerant arrangement which the Holy Spirit effected through the apostles, and stubbornly insisted on the Gentiles becoming Jews. These are the people of whom Faustus speaks under the name of Symmachians or Nazareans. Their number is now very small, but the sect still continues.","title":"Book XIX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_30_homily_xxiii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"\"He\" called them in, and lodged them.\" Good, that first he gives the men friendly treatment, after the fatigue of their journey, and makes them at home with him; \"and on the morrow,\" sets out with them.\" And certain accompany him: this too as Providence ordered it, that they should be witnesses afterwards when Peter would need to justify himself. \"And Cornelius was waiting for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.\" This is the part of a friend, this the part of a devout man, that where such blessings are concerned, he takes care that his near friends shall be made partakers of all. Of course (his \"near\" friends), those in whom he had ever full confidence; fearing, with such an interest at stake, to entrust the matter to others. In my opinion, it was by Cornelius himself that both friends and kinsmen had been brought to a better mind. \"And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.\" (v. 25.) This, both to teach the others, and by way of giving thanks to God, and showing his own humility: thereby making it plain, that though he had been commanded, yet in himself he had great piety. What then did Peter? \"But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.\" (v. 26.) Do you mark how, before all else (the Apostles) teach them this lesson, not to think great things of them? \"And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together. And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.\" (v. 27, 28.) Observe, he straightway speaks of the mercy of God, and points out to them that it is a great grace that God has shown them. Observe also how while he utters great things, at the same time he speaks modestly. For he does not say, We, being men who do not deign to keep company with any (such), have come to you: but what says he? \"Ye know\" -God commanded this[fn-9-P991_908319:1-nf] -\" that it is against law to keep company with, or come unto, one of another nation.\" Then he goes on to say, \"And to me God has shown \"-this he says, that none may account the thanks due to him -\"that I should call no man\"-that it may not look like obsequiousness to him, \"no human being,\" says he-\"common or unclean.\"[fn-9-P992_909073:2-nf] (v. 29.) \"Wherefore also\"-that they may not think the affair a breach of the law on his part, nor (Cornelius) suppose that because he was in a station of command therfore he had complied, but that they may ascribe all to God,-\" wherefore also I came without gainsaying as soon as I was sent for:\" (though) not only to keep company, but even to come unto (him) was not permitted. \"I ask therefore, for what intent ye have sent for me.\" Already Peter had heard the whole matter from the soldiers also, but he wishes them first to confess, and to make them amenable to the Faith. What then does Cornelius? He does not say, Why, did not the soldiers tell thee? but observe again, how humbly he speaks. For he says, \"From the fourth day I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing, and said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God. And at the ninth hour,\" he says, \"I was praying.\" (v. 30, 31.) It seems to me, that this man had also fixed for himself set times of a life under stricter rule, and on certain days).[fn-9-P993_911906:3-nf] For this is why he hesays, \"From the fourth day.\"[fn-9-P994_916296:4-nf] See how great a thing prayer is! When he advanced in piety, then the Angel appears to him. \"From the fourth day:\" i.e. of the week; not \"four days ago.\" For, \"on the morrow Peter went away with them, and on the morrow after they entered into Caesarea:\" this is one day: and the day on which the persons sent came (to Joppa) one day: and on the third (the Angel) appeared: so that there are two days after that on which (Cornelius) had been praying. \"And, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing:\" he does not say, an Angel, so unassuming is he: \"and said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God. Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter: he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the seaside: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee. Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.\" (v. 31-33.) (b) See[fn-9-P995_917808:5-nf] what faith, what piety! He knew that it was no word of man that Peter spake, when he said, \"God hath shown me.\" Then says the man, \"We are present to hear all things that are commanded thee of the Lord. (a) Therefore it was that Peter asked, \"For what intent have ye sent for me?\" on purpose that he might so speak these very words. (d) \"Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respector of persons: but in every nation he that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, is acceptable to him.\" (v. 34, 35.) That is, be he uncircumcised or circumcised. (c) This also Paul declaring, saith, \"For there is no respect of persons with God.\"[fn-9-P996_920110:6-nf] (Rom. ii. 11.) (e) What then? (it may be asked) is the man yonder in Persia acceptable to Him? If he be worthy, in this regard he is acceptable, that it should be granted him to be brought unto faith (tw kataciwqhnai thj pistewj). The Eunuch from Ethiopia He overlooked not. \"What shall one say then of the religious men who have been overlooked?\" It is not the case, that any (such) ever was overlooked. But what he says is to this effect, that God rejects no man.[fn-9-P997_921057:7-nf] \"In every nation, he that feareth God and worketh righteousness:\" (by righteousness) he means, all virtue. Mark, how he subdues all elation of mind in him. That (the Jews) may not seem to be in the condition of persons cast off (he adds), \"The word which He sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: He is Lord of all (v. 36): this he says also for the sake of those present (of the Jews), that He may persuade them also: this is why he forces Cornelius to speak. \"He,\" saith he, \"is Lord of all.\" But observe at the very outset, \"The word,\" says he, \"which He sent unto the children of Israel;\" he gives them the preëminence. Then he adduces (these Gentiles) themselves as witnesses: \"ye know,\" says he, \"the matter which came to pass throughout all Judea, beginning at Galilee-then he confirms it from this also-\" after the baptism which John preached (v. 37)-(\"even Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Ghost and with power.\" (v. 38.) He does not mean, Ye know Jesus, for they did not know Him, but he speaks of the things done by Him:[fn-9-P998_922827:8-nf] \"Who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil: by this[fn-9-P999_923502:9-nf] he shows that many cases of lost senses or paralyzed limbs are the devil's work, and a wrench given to the body by him: as also Christ said. \"For God was with Him.\" Again, lowly terms. \"And we are witnesses of all things which He did, both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem\" (v. 39): both \"we,\" saith he, and ye. Then the Passion, and the reason why they do not believe: \"Whom also they slew, and hanged on a tree. Him God raised up the third day, and showed Him openly; not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with Him after He rose from the dead. (v. 40, 41.) This is a proof of the Resurrection. \"And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is He which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.\" (v. 42.) This is great. Then he adduces the testimony from the Prophets: \"To Him give all the prophets witness, that through His name, whosoever believeth in Him shall receive remission of sins. (v. 43.) This is a proof of that which was about to be: this is the reason why he here cites the Prophets.","title":"Homily XXIII.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":2,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"377","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In the Epistle of Peter to them of Pontus: \"Nor let any of you suffer as a thief, or a murderer, or as an evil-doer, or as a minder of other people's business,[fn-88-P8876_2850093:591-nf] but as a Christian.[fn-88-P8877_2850387:592-nf] ","title":"Treatise XII.

For neither if the Jew should wish, where it would disturb no man, to recede from Jewish observances, would he be prohibited by the Apostle, since the object of his counselling to abide therein was that Jews might not by being troubled about superfluous things be hindered from coming to those things which are necessary to salvation.

Peter, however, by his making as though salvation consisted in Judaism, was compelling the Gentiles to judaize; as is shown by Paul's words, where he says, \"Why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?[fn-42-P4278_2036365:18-nf] For they would be under no compulsion unless they saw that he observed them in such manner as if beside them could be no salvation. Peter's simulation therefore is not to be compared to Paul's liberty. And while we ought to love Peter for that he willingly received correction, we must not bolster up lying even by the authority of Paul, who both recalled Peter to the right path in the presence of them all, lest the Gentiles through him should be compelled to judaize; and bare witness to his own preaching, that whereas he was accounted hostile to the traditions of the fathers in that he would not impose them on the Gentiles, he did not despise to celebrate them himself according to the custom of his fathers, and therein sufficiently showed that this has remained in them at the Coming of Christ; that neither to the Jews they are pernicious, nor to the Gentiles necessary, nor henceforth to any of mankind means of salvation.[fn-42-P4279_2037318:19-nf] ","title":"On Lying.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_35_on_lying_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"14","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"8. For this reason, from the books of the New Testament, except the figurative pre-significations used by our Lord, if thou consider the life and manners of the Saints, their actions and sayings, nothing of the kind can be produced which should provoke to imitation of lying. For the simulation of Peter and Barnabas is not only recorded, but also reproved and corrected.[fn-42-P4269_2032239:9-nf] For it was not, as some suppose,[fn-42-P4270_2032292:10-nf] out of the same simulation that even Paul the Apostle either circumcised Timothy, or himself celebrated certain ceremonies[fn-42-P4271_2032468:11-nf] according to the Jewish rite; but he did so, out of that liberty of his mind whereby he preached that neither are the Gentiles the better for circumcision, nor the Jews the worse. Wherefore he judged that neither the former should be tied to the custom of the Jews, nor the Jews deterred from the custom of their fathers. Whence are those words of his: \"Is any man called being circumcised let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised. Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God. Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.\"[fn-42-P4272_2033135:12-nf] How can a man become uncircumcised after circumcision? but let him not do so, saith he: let him not so live as if he had become uncircumcised, that is, as if he had covered again with flesh the part that was bared, and ceased to be a Jew; as in another place he saith, \"Thy circumcision is become uncircumcision.\"[fn-42-P4273_2033473:13-nf] And this the Apostle said, not as though he would compel either those to remain in uncircumcision, or the Jews in the custom of their fathers: but that neither these nor those should be forced to the other custom; and, each should have power of abiding in his own custom, not necessity of so doing. For neither if the Jew should wish, where it would disturb no man, to recede from Jewish observances, would he be prohibited by the Apostle, since the object of his counselling to abide therein was that Jews might not by being troubled about superfluous things be hindered from coming to those things which are necessary to salvation. Neither would it be prohibited by him, if any of the Gentiles should wish to be circumcised for the purpose of showing that he does not detest the same as noxious, but holds it indifferently, as a seal,[fn-42-P4274_2034328:14-nf] the usefulness of which had already passed away with time; for it did not follow that, if there were now no salvation to be had from it, there was destruction to be dreaded therefrom. And for this reason, Timothy, having been called in uncircumcision, yet because his mother was a Jewess and he was bound, in order to gain his kindred, to show them that he had not learnt in the Christian discipline to abominate the sacraments of the old Law, was circumcised by the Apostle;[fn-42-P4275_2034822:15-nf] that in this way i they might prove to the Jews, that the reason why the Gentiles do not receive them, is notthat they are evil and were perniciously observed by the Fathers, but because they are no longer necessary to salvation after the advent of that so great Sacrament. which through so long times the whole of that ancient Scripture in its prophetical prefigurations did travail in birth withal.

So great blindness, moreover, hath occupied men's minds, that to them it is too little if we pronounce some lies not to be sins; but they must needs pronounce it to be sin in some things if we refuse to lie: and to such a pass have they been brought by defending lying, that even that first kind which is of all the most abominably wicked they pronounce to have been used by the Apostle Paul. For in the Epistle to the Galatians, written as it was,like the rest, for doctrine of religion and piety, they say that he has told a lie, in the passage where he says concerning Peter and: Barnabas, \"When I saw that they walked notuprightly according to the truth of the Gospel.\"[fn-43-P4373_2115436:78-nf] For, while they wish to defend Peter from error, and from that pravity of way into which he had fallen; the very way of religion in which is salvation for all men, they by breaking and mincing the authority of the Scriptures do endeavor themselves to overthrow. In which they do not see that it is not only lying, but perjury that they lay to the charge of the Apostle in the very doctrine of piety, that is, in an Epistle in which he preaches the Gospel; seeing that he there saith, before he relates that matter, \"What I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.\"[fn-43-P4374_2116025:79-nf] But it is time that we set bounds to this disputation: in the consideration and treatment whereof altogether there is nothing more meet to be, before all else, borne in mind and made our prayer, than that which the same Apostle saith: \"God is faithful, Who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able to bear, but will with the temptation make also a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.\"[fn-43-P4375_2116454:80-nf] ","title":"On Lying.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_35_book_xxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"70","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"68. We see the same thing in the Gospel, where the devils confess that Christ is the Son of God in the words used by Peter, but with a very different heart. So, though the words were the same, Peter is praised for his faith, while the impiety of the devils is checked. For Christ, not by human sense, but by divine knowledge, could inspect and infallibly discriminate the sources from which the words came. Besides, there are multitudes who confess that Christ is the Son of the living God, without meriting the same approval as Peter-not only of those who shall say in that day, \"Lord, Lord,\" and shall receive the sentence, \"Depart from me,\" but also of those who shall be placed on the right hand. They may probably never have denied Christ even once; they may never have opposed His suffering for our salvation; they may never have forced the Gentiles to do as the Jews;[fn-22-P2206_1321389:120-nf] and yet they shall not be honored equally with Peter, who, though he did all these things, will sit on one of the twelve thrones, and judge not only the twelve tribes, but the angels. So, again, many who have never desired another man's wife, or procured the death of the husband, as David did, will never reach the place which David nevertheless held in the divine favor.

Like a wild beast, he attacked all indiscriminately and without consideration. This is what Christ said: \"My cup indeed ye shall drink, and with the baptism wherewith I am baptized, shall ye be baptized.\" (Mark x. 39.) (b) \"And[fn-10-P1090_1033928:8-nf] he killed James the brother of John.\" (v. 2.) For there was also another James, the brother of the Lord: therefore to distinguish him, he says, \"The brother of John.\"[fn-10-P1091_1034220:9-nf] Do you mark that the sum of affairs rested in these three, especially Peter and James? (a) And how was it he did not kill Peter immediately? It mentions the reason: \"it was the day of unleavened bread:\" and he wished rather to make a display (ekpompeusai) with the killing of him. \"And when he saw it pleased the Jews.\" (v. 3.) For their own part, they now in consequence of Gamaliel's advice, abstained from bloodshedding: and besides, did not even invent accusations; but by means of others they compassed the same results. (c) This (counsel of Gamaliel's) above all was their condemnation: for the preaching was shown to be no longer a thing of men. \"He proceeded further to kill Peter also.\" (ch. v. 8.) In very deed was that fulfilled, \"We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.\" (Psa. xliv. 13.) \"Seeing,\" it says, \"it was a pleasing thing to the Jews.\" (Rom. viii. 36.) A pleasing thing, bloodshed, and unrighteous bloodshed, wickedness, impiety![fn-10-P1092_1036490:10-nf] He ministered to their senseless (atopoij) lusts: for, whereas he ought to have done the contrary, to check their rage, he made them more eager, as if he were an executioner, and not a physician to their diseased minds. (And this) though he had numberless warnings in the case of both his grandfather and his father Herod, how the former in consequence of his putting the children to death suffered the greatest calamities, and the latter by slaying John raised up against himself a grievous war. But[fn-10-P1093_1037138:11-nf] as they thought * * He feared lest Peter, in consequence of the slaying of James, should withdraw; and wishing to have him in safe keeping, he put him in prison: \"and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers\" (v. 4): the stricter the custody, the more wondrous the display. \"Peter therefore was kept in prison.\" (v. 5.) But this was all the better for Peter, who was thereby made more approved, and evinced his own manly courage. And it says, \"there was earnest prayer making.\" It was the prayer of (filial) affection: it was for a father they asked, a father mild. \"There was,\" it says, \"earnest prayer.\" Hear how they were affected to their teachers. No factions, no perturbation:[fn-10-P1094_1038002:12-nf] but they betook them to prayer, to that alliance which is indeed invincible, to this they betook them for refuge. They did not say, \"What? I, poor insignificant creature that I am, to pray for him!\" for, as they acted of love, they did not give these things a thought. And observe, it was during the feast, that (their enemies) brought these trials upon them, that their worth might be the more approved. \"And when Herod,\" etc. (v. 6.) See Peter sleeping, and not in distress or fear! That same night, after which he was to be brought forth, he slept, having cast all upon God. \"Between two soldiers, bound with two chains.\" (comp. 1 Pet. v. 7.) Mark, how strict the ward! \"And says, Arise.\" (v. 7.) The guards were asleep with him, and therefore perceived nothing of what was happening. \"And a light shined.\" What was the light for? In order that Peter might see as well as hear, and not imagine it to be all fancy. And the command, \"Arise quickly,[fn-10-P1095_1039495:13-nf] \" that he may not be remiss. He also smote him; so deeply did he sleep. (a) \"Rise,\" says he, \"quickly:\" this is not to hurry him (qorubountoj) but to persuade him not to delay. (c) \"And\" immediately \"his chains fell off from his hands.\" (b) How? answer me: where are the heretics?-let them answer. \"And the Angel said unto him,\" etc. (v. 8) by this also convincing him that it is no fancy: to this end he bids him gird himself and put on his shoes, that he may shake off his sleep, and know that it is real. (a) (e) \"And he wist not that it was true that was done by the Angel, but thought he saw a vision\" (v. 9): (e) well he might, by reason of the excessive greatness (uperbolhn) of the things taking place. Do you mark what a thing it is for a miracle to be excessive (ekplhttei shmeiou)? how it amazes (ekplhttei) the beholder? how it will not let the thing be believed?[fn-10-P1096_1041330:14-nf] For if Peter \"thought he saw a vision,\" though he had girded himself and put on his shoes, what would have been the case with another? \"And,\" it says, \"when they had passed the first and the second ward, they came to the iron gate, which opened unto them of its own accord\" (v. 10): and yet the things that had happened within (the prison) were more marvellous: but this was now more after the manner of man. \"And having gone out, they went along one street and immediately (all `until') the Angel departed from him.\" (v. 11.) When there was no hindrance, then the Angel departed. For Peter would not have gone along (prohlqen), there being so many hindrances. \"And when he came to himself:\" for in very truth, it was indeed an amazement (ekplhcij). \"Now,\" saith he, \"I know\"-now, not then, when I was in the prison,-\"that the Lord hath sent His Angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews. And when he had considered\" (v. 12), it says: viz. where he was, or, that he must not without more ado depart but requite his Benefactor: \"he came to the house of Mary the mother of John.\" Who is this John? Probably[fn-10-P1097_1042582:15-nf] he that was always with them: for this is why he adds his distinctive name (to parashmon), \"whose surname was Mark.\" But observe, \"praying\" in the night, how much they got by it: what a good thing affliction is; how wakeful it made them! Do you see how great the gain resulting from the death of Stephen? do you see how great the benefit accruing from this imprisonment? For it is not by taking vengeance upon those who wronged them that God shows the greatness of the Gospel: but in the wrong-doers themselves,[fn-10-P1098_1043369:16-nf] without any harm happening to those, he shows what a mighty thing the afflictions in themselves are, that we may not seek in any wise deliverance from them, nor the avenging of our wrongs. And mark how the very servant-girls were henceforth upon an equality with them. \"For joy,\" it says, \"she opened not.\" (v. 13, 14.) This too is well done, that they likewise may not be amazed by seeing him at once, and that they may be incredulous, and their minds may be exercised. \"But ran in,\" etc. just as we are wont to do, she was eager to be herself the bringer of the good tidings, for good news it was indeed. \"And they said unto her, Thou art mad: but she constantly affirmed that it was even so: then said they, It is his Angel.\" (v. 15.) This is a truth, that each man has an Angel.[fn-10-P1099_1044431:17-nf] And what would the Angel?[fn-11-P1100_1045326:18-nf] It was from the time (of night) that they surmised this. But when he \"continued knocking, and when they had opened, and saw him, they were astonished. But he beckoning to them with his hand\" (v. 16, 17), made them keep quiet, to hear all that had happened to him. He was now an object of more affectionate desire to the disciples, not only in consequence of his being saved, but by his sudden coming in upon them and straightway departing. Now, both his friends learn all clearly; and the aliens also learn, if they had a mind, but they had not. The same thing happened in the case of Christ. \"Tell these things,\" he says, \"to James, and to the brethren.\" How free from all vainglory! Nor did he say, Make known these things to people everywhere, but, \"to the brethren.

These four are, as it were, the elements of the faith of the Church, out of which elements the whole world which is reconciled to God in Christ is put together; as Paul says,[fn-61-P6133_937094:23-nf] \"God was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself; \"of which world Jesus bore the sin; for it is of the world of the Church that the word is written,[fn-61-P6134_937266:24-nf] \"Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.\" The Gospels then being four, I deem the first fruits of the Gospels to be that which you[fn-61-P6135_937437:25-nf] have enjoined me to search into according to my powers, the Gospel of John, that which speaks of him whose genealogy had already been set forth, but which begins to speak of him at a point before he had any genealogy. For Matthew, writing for the Hebrews who looked for Him who was to come of the line of Abraham and of David, says:[fn-61-P6136_937786:26-nf] \"The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.\" And Mark, knowing what he writes, narrates the beginning of the Gospel; we may perhaps find what he aims at in John; in the beginning the Word, God the Word. But Luke, though he says at the beginning of Acts, \"The former treatise did I make about all that Jesus began to do and to teach,\" yet leaves to him who lay on Jesus' breast the greatest and completest discourses about Jesus. For none of these plainly declared His Godhead, as John does when he makes Him say, \"I am the light of the world,\" \"I am the way and the truth and the life,\" \"I am the resurrection, \"I am the door,\" \"I am the good shepherd; \"and in the Apocalypse, \"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.\" We may therefore make bold to say that the Gospels are the first fruits of all the Scriptures, but that of the Gospels that of John is the first fruits. No one can apprehend the meaning of it except he have lain on Jesus' breast and received from Jesus Mary to be his mother also. Such an one must he become who is to be another John, and to have shown to him, like John, by Jesus Himself Jesus as He is. For if Mary, as those declare who with sound mind extol her, had no other son but Jesus, and yet Jesus says to His mother, \"Woman, behold thy son,\"[fn-61-P6137_939156:27-nf] and not \"Behold you have this son also,\" then He virtually said to her, \"Lo, this is Jesus, whom thou didst bear.\" Is it not the case that every one who is perfect lives himself no longer,[fn-61-P6138_939364:28-nf] but Christ lives in him; and if Christ lives in him, then it is said of him to Mary, \"Behold thy son Christ.\" What a mind, then, must we have to enable us to interpret in a worthy manner this work, though it be committed to the earthly treasure-house of common speech, of writing which any passer-by can read, and which can be heard when read aloud by any one who lends to it his bodily ears? What shall we say of this work? He who is accurately to apprehend what it contains should be able to say with truth,[fn-61-P6139_939891:29-nf] \"We have the mind of Christ, that we may know those things which are bestowed on us by God.\" It is possible to quote one of Paul's sayings in support of the contention that the whole of the New Testament is Gospel. He writes in a certain place:[fn-61-P6140_940160:30-nf] \"According to my Gospel.\" Now we have no written work of Paul which is commonly called a Gospel. But all that he preached and said was the Gospel; and what he preached and said he was also in the habit of writing, and what he wrote was therefore Gospel. But if what Paul wrote was Gospel, it follows that what Peter wrote was also Gospel, and in a word all that was said or written to perpetuate the knowledge of Christ's sojourn on earth, and to prepare for His second coming, or to bring it about as a present reality in those souls which were willing to receive the Word of God as He stood at the door and knocked and sought to come into them.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_36_against_lying_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"33","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"26. To show then that some things in the Scriptures which are thought to be lies are not what they are thought, if they be rightly understood, let it not seem to thee to tell little against them, that it is not from Apostolic but from Prophetical books that they find as it were precedents of lying. For all those which they mention by name, in which each lied, are read in those books in which not only words but many deeds of a figurative meaning are recorded, because it was also in a figurative sense that they were done. But in figures that which is spoken as a seeming lie, being well understood, is found to be a truth. The Apostles, however, in their Epistles spoke in another sort, and in another sort are written the Acts of the Apostles, to wit, because now the New Testament was revealed, which was veiled in those prophetic figures. In short, in all those Apostolic Epistles, and in that large book in which their acts are narrated with canonical truth, we do not find any person lying, such that from him a precedent can be set forth by these men for license of lying For that simulation of Peter and Barnabas with which they were compelling the Gentiles to Judaize, was deservedly reprehended and set right, both that it might not do harm at the time, and that it might not weigh with posterity as a thing to be imitated. For when the Apostle Paul saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the Gospel, he said to Peter in the presence of them all, \"If thou,being a Jew, livest as the Gentiles; and not as do the Jews, how compellest thou the Gentiles to Judaize?\"[fn-44-P4453_2178773:44-nf] But in that which himself did, to the intent that by retaining and acting upon certain observances of the law after the Jewish custom he might show that he was no enemy to the Law and to the Prophets, far be it from us to believe that hedid so as a liar. As indeed concerning thismatter his sentence is sufficiently well known, whereby it was settled that neither Jews who then believed in Christ were to be prohibitedfrom the traditions of their fathers, nor Gentiles when they became Christians to be compelled thereunto: in order that those sacred rites[fn-44-P4454_2179352:45-nf] which were well known to have been of God enjoined, should not be shunned as sacrileges; nor yet accounted so necessary, now that the New Testament was revealed, as though without them whoso should be converted unto God, could not be saved. For there were some who thought so and preached, albeit after Christ's Gospel received; and to these had feignedly consented both Peter and Barnabas, and so were compelling the Gentiles to Judaize. For it was a compelling, to preach them to be so necessary as if, even after the Gospel received, without them were no salvation in Christ. This the error of certain did suppose, this Peter's fear did feign, this Paul's liberty did beat down. What therefore he saith, \"I am made all things to all, that I might gain all,\"[fn-44-P4455_2180133:46-nf] that did he, by suffering with others, not by lying. For each becomes as though he were that person whom he would fain succor, when he succoreth with the same pity wherewith he would wish himself to be succored, if himself were set in the same misery. Therefore he becomes as though he were that person, not for that he deceives him, but for that he thinks himself as him. Whence is that of the Apostle, which I have before rehearsed, \"Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness, considering thyself lest thou also be tempted.\"[fn-44-P4456_2180763:47-nf] For if, because he said, \"To the Jews became I as a Jew, and to them which were under the law as under the law,\"[fn-44-P4457_2180893:48-nf] he is therefore to be accounted to have in a lying manner taken up the sacraments of the old law, he ought in the same manner to have taken up, in a lying way, the idolatry of the Gentiles, because he hath said that to them which were without law he became as without law; which thing in any wise he did not. For he did not any where sacrifice to idols or adore those figments and not rather freely as a martyr of Christ show that they were to be detested and eschewed. From no apostolic acts or speeches, therefore , do these men allege things meet for imitation as examples of lying. From prophetical deeds or words, then, the reason why they seem to themselves to have what they may allege, is only for that they take figures prenunciative to be lies, because they are sometimes like unto lies. But when they are referred to those things for the signifying of which they were so done or said, they are found to be significations full of truth, and therefore in no wise to be lies. A lie, namely, is a false signification with will of deceiving. But that is no false signification, where, although one thing is signified by another, yet the thing signified is a true thing, if it be rightly understood.","title":"Against Lying.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_126_oration_on_the_psalms_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"ANF-06","text":"II.

Or, if it must be understood more highly, that \"He who doeth these things shall live in them\" was written in reference to eternal life; the power of the law is so expressed that the weakness of man in himself, itself failing to do what the law commands, might seek help from the grace of God rather of faith, seeing that by His mercy even faith itself is bestowed. Because faith is thus possessed, according as God has given to every one the measure of faith.[fn-56-P5620_2212027:24-nf] For if men have it not of themselves, but men receive the Spirit of power and of love and of continence, whence that very same teacher of the Gentiles says, \"For we have not received the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of continence,\"[fn-56-P5621_2212295:25-nf] -assuredly also the Spirit of faith is received, of which he says, \"Having also the same Spirit of faith.\"[fn-56-P5622_2212420:26-nf] Truly, then, says the law, \"He who doeth these things shall live in them.\" But in order to do these things, and live in them, there is necessary not law which ordains this, but faith which obtains this.

His words are: \"The law worketh wrath.\"[fn-60-P6072_2356633:124-nf] The reason of this statement lies in the fact that God's wrath is greater in the case of the transgressor who by the law knows sin, and yet commits it; such a man is thus a transgressor of the law, even as the apostle says in another sentence,\" For where no law is, there is no transgression.\"[fn-60-P6073_2356947:125-nf] It is in accordance with this principle that he elsewhere says, \"That we may serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter;\"[fn-60-P6074_2357111:126-nf] wishing the law to be here understood :,by \"the oldness of the letter,\" and what else by \"newness of spirit\" than grace? Then, that it might not be thought that he had brought any accusation, or suggested any blame, against the law, he immediately takes himself to task with this inquiry: \"What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? God forbid.\" He then adds the statement: \"Nay, I had not known sin but by the law;\"[fn-60-P6075_2357546:127-nf] which is of the same import as the passage above quoted: \"By the law is the knowledge of sin.\"[fn-60-P6076_2357665:128-nf] Then: \"For I had not known lust,\" he says, \"except the law had said, `Thou shalt not covet.'\"[fn-60-P6077_2357780:129-nf] But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence.

Well, but if the law is not grace, seeing that in order that the law itself may be kept, it is not the law, but only grace which can give help, will not nature at any rate be grace? For this, too, the Pelagians have been bold enough to aver, that grace is the nature in which we were created, so as to possess a rational mind, by which we are enabled to understand,-formed as we are in the image of God, so as to have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that creepeth upon the earth. This, however, is not the grace which the apostle commends to us through the faith of Jesus Christ.

But the law was in existence up to that time, and it did not justify; and nature existed too, but it did not justify.

Before this (Peter) being found fault with, justified himself, and said all that he said in the' tone of apology, which was what made his words acceptable: then, the Jews having turned away, upon this (Paul) came to the Gentiles. Here again, seeing another extravagance coming in, upon this (the apostle) enacts the law. For as it is likely that they, as being taught of God, discoursed to all indifferently, this moved to jealousy them of the Jews (who had believed). And they did not merely speak of circumcision, but they said, Ye cannot even be saved. Whereas the very opposite to this was the case, that receiving circumcision they could not be saved. Do you mark how closely the trials succeed each other, from within, from without? It is well ordered too, that this happens when Paul is present, that he may answer them. \"When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.\" (v. 2.) And Paul does not say, What? Have I not a right to be believed after so many signs? but he complied for their sakes. \"And being brought on their way by the Church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.\" (v. 3.) And observe, the consequence is that all the Samaritans also, learn what has come to the Gentiles: and they rejoiced. \"And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the Church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.\" (v. 4.) See what a providence is here! \"But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses. And the apostles and elders came together to consider of this matter. And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that of old days God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the Gospel, and believe.\" (v. 5-7.) Observe Peter from the first standing aloof (kexwrismenon) from the affair, and even to this time judaizing. And yet (says he) \"ye know.\" (ch. x. 45; xi, 2.) Perhaps those were present who of old found fault with him in the matter of Cornelius, and went in with him (on that occasion): for this reason he brings them forward as witnesses. \"From old days,\" he says, \"did choose among you.\" What means, \"Among you?\" Either, in Palestine, or, you being present. \"By my mouth.\" Observe how he shows that it was God speaking by him, and no human utterance. \"And God, that knoweth the hearts, gave testimony unto them:\" he refers them to the spiritual testimony: \"by giving them the Holy Ghost even as unto us.\" (v. 8.) Everywhere he puts the Gentiles upon a thorough equality. \"And put no difference between us and them, having purified their hearts by faith.\" (v. 9.) From faith alone, he says, they obtained the same gifts. This is also meant as a lesson to those (objectors); this is able to teach even them that faith only is needed, not works nor circumcision. For indeed they do not say all this only by way of apology for the Gentiles, but to teach (the Jewish believers) also to abandon the Law. However, at present this is not said. \"Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples?\" (v. 10.) What means, \"Tempt ye God?\" As if He had not power to save by faith. Consequently, it proceeds from a want of faith, this bringing in the Law. Then he shows that they themselves were nothing benefited by it, and he turns the whole (stress of his speech) against the Law, not against them, and (so) cuts short the accusation of them: \"which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear. But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus we shall be saved, even as they.\" (v. 11.) How full of power these words! The same that Paul says at large in the Epistle to the Romans, the same says Peter here. \"For if Abraham,\" says (Paul), \"was justified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God.\" (Rom. iv. 2.) Do you perceive that all this is more a lesson for them than apology for the Gentiles? However, if he had spoken this without a plea for speaking, he[fn-12-P1261_1218110:2-nf] would have been suspected: an occasion having offered, he lays hold of it, and speaks out fearlessly.

His also is a more complete oration, as indeed it puts the completion to the matter under discussion. (a) \"Symeon,\" he says, \"declared:\" (namely,) in Luke, in that he prophesied, \"Which Thou hast prepared before the face of all nations, a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of Thy people Israel.\"[fn-12-P1290_1241754:3-nf] (c) \"How God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for His Name.\" (Luke ii. 25.) Then, since that (witness), though[fn-12-P1291_1242622:4-nf] from the time indeed he was manifest, yet had not authority by reason of his not being ancient, therefore he produces ancient prophecy also, saying, \"And to this agree the words of the Prophets, as it is written: After this I wilt return, and will build again the tabernacle of David which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up.\" (v. 16.) What? was Jerusalem raised up? Was it not rather thrown down? What[fn-12-P1292_1243552:5-nf] sort of raising up does he call that which took place after the return from Babylon? \"That the residue of men,\" he says, \"may seek the Lord, even all the Gentiles upon whom My Name is called.\" (v. 17.) Then, what makes his word authoritative-\"Saith the Lord, which doeth all these things:\" and, for that this is no new thing, but all was planned from the beginning, \"Known unto God are all His works from everlasting.\"[fn-12-P1293_1244419:6-nf] (v. 18.) And then again his authority (kai to aciwma palin) (as Bishop): \"Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God: but that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollution of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood. For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.\" (v. 19-21.) Since[fn-12-P1294_1245519:7-nf] then they had heard of the Law, with good reason he enjoins these things from the Law, that he may not seem to make it of no authority. And (yet) observe how he does not let them be told these things from the Law, but from himself, saying, It is not that I heard these things from the Law, but how? \"We have judged.\" Then the decree is made in common. \"Then pleased it the Apostles and elders, together with the whole Church, to choose men of their own company\"-do you observe they do not merely enact these matters, and nothing more?-\"and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas:namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren: and they wrote letters by them after this manner.\" (v. 22.) And observe, the more to authenticate the decree, they send men of their own, that there may be no room for regarding Paul and his company with suspicion. \"The Apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.\" (v. 23.) And mark[fn-12-P1295_1246739:8-nf] with what forbearance of all harsh vituperation of those (brethren) they indite their epistle. \"Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the Law: to whom we gave no such commandment.\" (v. 24.) Sufficient was this charge against the temerity of those men, and worthy of the Apostles' moderation, that they said nothing beyond this. Then to show that they do not act despotically, that all are agreed in this, that with deliberation they write this-\"It seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send men of ours whom we have chosen\" (v. 25)-then, that it may not look like disparagement of Paul and Barnabas, that those men are sent, observe the encomium passed upon them-\"together with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. We have sent therefore Judas and Silas; who shall also tell you the same things by mouth. For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us\"-it is not man's doing, it says-\"to lay upon you no greater burden\"-again it calls the Law a burden: then apologizing even for these injunctions-\"save these necessary things\" (v. 26-28): \"That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. (v. 29.) For these things the New Testament did not enjoin: we nowhere find that Christ discoursed about these matters; but these things they take from the Law. \"From things strangled,\" it says, \"and from blood.\" here it prohibits murder. (Comp. Gen. ix. 5.) \"So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle: which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.\" (v. 30, 31.) Then those (brethren) also exhorted them: and having established them, for towards Paul they were contentiously disposed, so departed from them in peace. \"And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the Apostles.\" (v. 32, 33.)

What, then, do they venture to say, when their mouth is closed[fn-31-P3169_1846030:1-nf] by the force of truth, with which they will not agree? \"Cyprian,\" say they, \"whose great merits and vast learning we all know, decreed in a Council,[fn-31-P3170_1846196:2-nf] with many of his fellow-bishops contributing their several opinions, that all heretics and schismatics, that is, all who are severed from the communion of the one Church, are without baptism; and therefore, whosoever has joined the communion of the Church after being baptized by them must be baptized in the Church.\" The authority of Cyprian does not alarm me, because I am reassured by his humility. We know, indeed, the great merit of the bishop and martyr Cyprian; but is it in any way greater than that of the apostle and martyr Peter, of whom the said Cyprian speaks as follows in his epistle to Quintus? \"For neither did Peter, whom the Lord chose first, and on whom He built His Church,[fn-31-P3171_1847108:3-nf] when Paul afterwards disputed with him about circumcision, claim or assume anything insolently and arrogantly to himself, so as to say that he held the primacy, and should rather be obeyed of those who were late and newly come. Nor did he despise Paul because he had before been a persecutor of the Church, but he admitted the counsel of truth, and readily assented to the legitimate grounds which Paul maintained; giving us thereby a pattern of concord and patience, that we should not pertinaciously love our own opinions, but should rather account as our own any true and rightful suggestions of our brethren and colleagues for the common health and weal.\"[fn-31-P3172_1847787:4-nf] Here is a passage in which Cyprian records what we also learn in holy Scripture, that the Apostle Peter, in whom the primacy of the apostles shines with such exceeding grace, was corrected by the later Apostle Paul, when he adopted a custom in the matter of circumcision at variance with the demands of truth. If it was therefore possible for Peter in some point to walk not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, so as to compel the Gentiles to judaize, as Paul writes in that epistle in which he calls God to witness that he does not lie; for he says, \"Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not;\"[fn-31-P3173_1848441:5-nf] and, after this sacred and awful calling of God to witness, he told the whole tale, saying in the course of it, \"But when I saw that they walked not uprightly, according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?\"[fn-31-P3174_1848834:6-nf] -if Peter, I say, could compel the Gentiles to live after the manner of the Jews, contrary to the rule of truth which the Church afterwards held, why might not Cyprian, in opposition to the rule of faith which the whole Church afterwards held, compel heretics and schismatics to be baptized afresh? I suppose that there is no slight to Cyprian in comparing him with Peter in respect to his crown of martyrdom; rather I ought to be afraid lest I am showing disrespect towards Peter. For who can be ignorant that the primacy of his apostleship is to be preferred to any episcopate whatever? But, granting the difference in the dignity of their sees, yet they have the same glory in their martyrdom. And whether it may be the case that the hearts of those who confess and die for the true faith in the unity of charity take precedence of each other in different points, the Lord Himself will know, by the hidden and wondrous dispensation of whose grace the thief hanging on the cross once for all confesses Him, and is sent on the selfsame day to paradise,[fn-31-P3175_1849904:7-nf] while Peter, the follower of our Lord, denies Him thrice, and has his crown postponed:[fn-31-P3176_1850013:8-nf] for us it were rash to form a judgment from the evidence. But if any one were now found compelling a man to becircumcised after the Jewish fashion, as a necessary preliminary for baptism, this would meet with much more general repudiation by mankind, than if a man should be compelled to be baptized again. Wherefore, if Peter, on doing this, is corrected by his later colleague Paul, and is yet preserved by the bond of peace and unity till he is promoted to martyrdom, how much more readily and constantly should we prefer, either to the authority of a single bishop, or to the Council of a single province, the rule that has been established by the statutes of the universal Church? For this same Cyprian, in urging his view of the question, was still anxious to remain in the unity of peace even with those who differed from him on this point, as is shown by his own opening address at the beginning of the very Council which is quoted by the Donatists.

God had in His thoughts our salvation by which we were redeemed; Judas had in his thoughts the price for which he sold the Lord. The Son Himself had in His thoughts the price He gave for us, Judas in his the price he received to sell Him. The diverse intention therefore makes the thingsdone diverse. Though the thing be one, yet if we measure it by the diverse intentions, we find the one a thing to be loved, the other to be condemned; the one we find a thing to be glorified, the other to be detested. Such is the force of charity. See that it alone discriminates, it alone distinguishes the doings of men.","title":"Homily VII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":12,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_56_book_ii_","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"80","folder":"ANF-04","text":"The first book of our answer to the treatise of Celsus, entitled A True Discourse, which concluded with the representation of the Jew addressing Jesus, having now extended to a sufficient length, we intend the present part as a reply to the charges brought by him against those who have been converted from Judaism to Christianity.[fn-79-P7999_1946124:1-nf] And we call attention, in the first place, to this special question, viz., why Celsus, when he had once resolved upon the introduction of individuals upon the stage of his book, did not represent the Jew as addressing the converts from heathenism rather than those from Judaism, seeing that his discourse, if directed to us, would have appeared more likely to produce an impression.[fn-80-P8000_1946576:2-nf] But probably this claimant to universal knowledge does not know what is appropriate in the matter of such representations; and therefore let us proceed to consider what he has to say to the converts from Judaism. He asserts that \"they have forsaken the law of their fathers, in consequence of their minds being led captive by Jesus; that they have been most ridiculously deceived, and that they have become deserters to another name and to another mode of life.\" Here he has not observed that the Jewish converts have not deserted the law of their fathers, inasmuch as they live according to its prescriptions, receiving their very name from the poverty of the law, according to the literal acceptation of the word; for Ebion signifies \"poor\" among the Jews,[fn-80-P8001_1947351:3-nf] and those Jews who have received Jesus as Christ are called by the name of Ebionites. Nay, Peter himself seems to have observed for a considerable time the Jewish observances enjoined by the law of Moses, not having yet learned from Jesus to ascend from the law that is regulated according to the letter, to that which is interpreted according to the spirit,-a fact which we learn from the Acts of the Apostles. For on the day after the angel of God appeared to Cornelius, suggesting to him \"to send to Joppa, to Simon surnamed Peter,\" Peter \"went up into the upper room to pray about the sixth hour. And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready he fell into a trance, and saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth; wherein were all manner of four-footed beasts, and creeping things of the earth, and fowls of the air. And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat. But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean. And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call thou not common.\"[fn-80-P8002_1948561:4-nf] Now observe how, by this instance, Peter is represented as still observing the Jewish customs respecting clean and unclean animals. And from the narrative that follows, it is manifest that he, as being yet a Jew, and living according to their traditions, and despising those who were beyond the pale of Judaism, stood in need of a vision to lead him to communicate to Cornelius (who was not an Israelite according to the flesh), and to those who were with him, the word of faith. Moreover, in the Epistle to the Galatians, Paul states that Peter, still from fear of the Jews, ceased upon the arrival of James to eat with the Gentiles, and \"separated himself from them, fearing them that were of the circumcision; \"[fn-80-P8003_1949297:5-nf] and the rest of the Jews, and Barnabas also, followed the same course. And certainly it was quite consistent that those should not abstain from the observance of Jewish usages who were sent to minister to the circumcision, when they who \"seemed to be pillars\" gave the right hand of fellowship to Paul and Barnabas, in order that, while devoting themselves to the circumcision, the latter might preach to the Gentiles. And why do I mention that they who preached to the circumcision withdrew and separated themselves from the heathen, when even Paul himself \"became as a Jew to the Jews, that he might gain the Jews? \"Wherefore also in the Acts of the Apostles it is related that he even brought an offering to the altar, that he might satisfy the Jews that he was no apostate from their law.[fn-80-P8004_1950111:6-nf] Now, if Celsus had been acquainted with all these circumstances, he would not have represented the Jew holding such language as this to the converts from Judaism: \"What induced you, my fellow-citizens, to abandon the law of your fathers, and to allow your minds to be led captive by him with whom we have just conversed, and thus be most ridiculously deluded, so as to become deserters from us to another name, and to the practices of another life? \"","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_54_book_iii_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"38","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"10.

At the same time, also, he warns us that it was not impossible that Cyprian might have held an opinion about baptism at variance with that required by the truth, as held by the Church both before and after him, if even Peter could hold a view at variance with the truth as taught us by the Apostle Paul.[fn-33-P3307_1910905:13-nf] ","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_55_book_iv_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"40","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"9.

And seeing that this was not enough for him, as against the custom of the whole world, he laid hold on these reasons which we just now, considering them with great care, and being confirmed by the antiquity of the custom itself, and by the subsequent authority of a plenary Council, found to be truth-like rather than true; which, however, seemed to him true, as he toiled in a question of the greatest obscurity, and was in doubt about the remission of sins,-whether it could fail to be given in the baptism of Christ, and whether it could be given among heretics. In which matter, if an imperfect revelation of the truth was given to Cyprian, that the greatness of his love in not deserting the unity of the Church might be made manifest, there is yet not any reason why any one should venture to claim superiority over the strong defenses and excellence of his virtues, and the abundance of graces which were found in him, merely because, with the instruction derived from the strength of a general Council, he sees something which Cyprian did not see, because the Church had not yet held a plenary Council on the matter. Just as no one is so insane as to set himself up as surpassing the merits of the Apostle Peter, because, taught by the epistles of the Apostle Paul, and confirmed by the custom of the Church herself, he does not compel the Gentiles to judaize, as Peter once had done.[fn-34-P3466_1969235:35-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_55_book_iv_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"18.

Neither [in that case] would they have had such a tenor with regard to the first covenant, as not even to have been willing to eat with the Gentiles. For even Peter, although he had been sent to instruct them, and had been constrained by a vision to that effect, spake nevertheless with not a little hesitation, saying to them: \"Ye know how it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company with, or to come unto, one of another nation; but God hath shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean.

But they themselves, while knowing the same God, continued in the ancient observances; so that even Peter, fearing also lest he might incur their reproof, although formerly eating with the Gentiles, because of the vision, and of the Spirit who had rested upon them, yet, when certain persons came from James, withdrew himself, and did not eat with them. And Paul said that Barnabas likewise did the same thing.[fn-76-P7601_2061392:219-nf] Thus did the apostles, whom the Lord made witnesses of every action and of every doctrine-for upon all occasions do we find Peter, and James, and John present with Him-scrupulously act according to the dispensation of the Mosaic law, showing that it was from one and the same God; which they certainly never would have done, as I have already said, if they had learned from the Lord [that there existed] another Father besides Him who appointed the dispensation of the law.","title":"Book III.","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":2,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_60_book_iii_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"101","folder":"ANF-01","text":"1.

Let us not be considered troublesome to our readers, if we discuss the same question often and from different points of view. For although the Holy Catholic Church throughout all nations be fortified by the authority of primitive custom and of a plenary Council against those arguments which throw some darkness over the question about baptism, whether it can be the same among heretics and schismatics that it is in the Catholic Church, yet, since a different opinion has at one time been entertained in the unity of the Church itself, by men who are in no wise to be despised, and especially by Cyprian, whose authority men endeavor to use against us who are far removed from his charity, we are therefore compelled to make use of the opportunity of examining and considering all that we find on this subject in his Council and letters, in order, as it were, to handle at some considerable length this same question, and to show how it has more truly been the decision of the whole body of the Catholic Church, that heretics or schismatics, who have received baptism already in the body from which they came, should be admitted with it into the communion of the Catholic Church, being corrected in their error and rooted and grounded in the faith, that, so far as concerns the sacrament of baptism, there should not be an addition of something that was wanting, but a turning to profit of what was in them. And the holy Cyprian indeed, now that the corruptible body no longer presseth down the soul, nor the earthly tabernacle presseth down the mind that museth upon many things,[fn-42-P4201_2212750:1-nf] sees with greater clearness that truth to which his charity made him deserving to attain. May he therefore help us by his prayers, while we labor in the mortality of the flesh as in a darksome cloud, that if the Lord so grant it, we may imitate so far as we can the good that was in him. But if he thought otherwise than right on any point, and persuaded certain of his brethren and colleagues to entertain his views in a matter which he now sees clearly through the revelation of Him whom he loved, let us, who are far inferior to his merits, yet following, as our weakness will allow, the authority of the Catholic Church of which he was himself a conspicuous and most noble member, strive our utmost against heretics and schismatics, seeing that they, being cut off from the unity which he maintained, and barren of the love with which he was fruitful, and fallen away from the humility in which he stood, are disavowed and condemned the more by him, in proportion as he knows that they wish to search out his writings for purposes of treachery, and are unwilling to imitate what he did for the maintainance of peace,-like those who, calling themselves Nazarene Christians, and circumcising the foreskin of their flesh after the fashion of the Jews, being heretics by birth in that error from which Peter, when straying from the truth, was called by Paul[fn-42-P4202_2214125:2-nf] persist in the same to the present day. As therefore they have remained in their perversity cut off from the body of the Church, while Peter has been crowned in the primacy of the apostles through the glory of martyrdom, so these men, while Cyprian, through the abundance of his love, has been received into the portion of the saints through the brightness of his passion, are obliged to recognize themselves as exiles from unity, and, in defence of their calumnies, set up a citizen of unity as an opponent against the very home of unity. Let us, therefore, go on to examine the other judgments of that Council after the same fashion.","title":"Book VII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_58_book_vii_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"114","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"38.

For the gain to the Apostle Paul from his strictness would not have counterbalanced the loss to all nations from his speedy death. And this would certainly have been then incurred by the whole Church unless this good and salutary hypocrisy had preserved him for the preaching of the Gospel. For then we may rightly and pardonably acquiesce in the wrong of a lie, when, as we said, a greater harm depends on telling the truth, and when the good which results to us from speaking the truth cannot counterbalance the harm which will be caused by it. And elsewhere the blessed Apostle testifies in other words that he himself always observed this disposition; for when he says: \"To the Jews I became as a Jew that I might gain the Jews; to those who were under the law as being under the law, though not myself under the law, that I might gain those who were under the law; to those who were without law, I became as without law, though I was not without the law of God but under the law of Christ, that I might gain those who were without law; to the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I became all things to all men, that I might save all;\"[fn-59-P5931_2099236:20-nf] what does he show but that according to the weakness and the capacity of those who were being instructed he always lowered himself and relaxed something of the vigour of perfection, and did not cling to what his own strict life might seem to demand, but rather preferred that which the good of the weak might require? And that we may trace these matters out more carefully and recount one by one the glories of the good deeds of the Apostles, some one may ask how the blessed Apostle can be proved to have suited himself to all men in all things. When did he to the Jews become as a Jew? Certainly in the case where, while he still kept in his inmost heart the opinion which he had maintained to the Galatians saying: \"Behold, I, Paul, say unto you that if ye be circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing,\"[fn-59-P5932_2100068:21-nf] yet by circumcising Timothy he adopted a shadow as it were of Jewish superstition. And again, where did he become to those under the law, as under the law? There certainly where James and all the Elders of the Church, fearing lest he might be attacked by the multitude of Jewish believers, or rather of Judaizing Christians, who had received the faith of Christ in such a way as still to be bound by the rites of legal ceremonies, came to his rescue in his difficulty with this counsel and advice, and said: \"Thou seest, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews, who have believed, and they are all zealots for the law. But they have heard of thee that thou teachest those Jews who are among the Gentiles to depart from Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children;\" and below: \"Do therefore this that we say unto thee: we have four men who have a vow on them.

Do you ask also where for the good of those who were utterly ignorant of the law of God, he himself became as if without law? Read the introduction to his sermon at Athens where heathen wickedness was flourishing: \"As I passed by,\" he says, \"I saw your idols and an altar on which was written: To the unknown God;\" and when he had thus started from their superstition, as if he himself also had been without law, under the cloke of that profane inscription he introduced the faith of Christ, saying: \"What therefore ye ignorantly worship, that declare I unto you.\" And after a little, as if he had known nothing whatever of the Divine law, he chose to bring forward a verse of a heathen poet rather than a saying of Moses or Christ, saying: \"As some also of your own poets have said: for we are also His offspring.\" And when he had thus approached them with their own authorities, which they could not reject, thus confirming the truth by things false, he added and said: \"Since then we are the offspring of God we ought not to think that the Godhead is like to gold or silver or stone sculptured by the art and device of man.\"[fn-59-P5935_2102689:24-nf] But to the weak he became weak, when, by way of permission, not of command, he allowed those who could not contain themselves to return together again,[fn-59-P5936_2102865:25-nf] or when he fed the Corinthians with milk and not with meat, and says that he was with them in weakness and fear and much trembling.[fn-59-P5937_2103021:26-nf] But he became all things to all men that he might save all, when he says: \"He that eateth let him not despise him that eateth not, and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth:\"and: \"He that giveth his virgin in marriage doeth well, and he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better;\" and elsewhere: \"Who,\" says he, \"is weak, and I am not weak? Who is offended, and I burn not?\" and in this way he fulfilled what he had commanded the Corinthians to do when he said: \"Be ye without offence to Jews and Greeks and the Church of Christ, as I also please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit but that of the many, that they may be saved.\"[fn-59-P5938_2103712:27-nf] For it had certainly been profitable not to circumcise Timothy, not to shave his head, not to undergo Jewish purification, not to practice going barefoot,[fn-59-P5939_2103935:28-nf] not to pay legal vows; but he did all these things because he did not seek his own profit but that of the many. And although this was done with the full consideration of God, yet it was not free from dissimulation. For one who through the law of Christ was dead to the law that he might live to God, and who had made and treated that righteousness of the law in which he had lived blameless, as dung, that he might gain Christ, could not with true fervour of heart offer what belonged to the law; nor is it right to believe that he who had said: \"For if I again rebuild what I have destroyed, I make myself a transgressor,\"[fn-59-P5940_2104934:29-nf] would himself fall into what he had condemned. And to such an extent is account taken, not so much of the actual thing which is done as of the disposition of the doer, that on the other hand truth is sometimes found to have injured some, and a lie to have done them good. For when Saul was grumbling to his servants about David's flight, and saying: \"Will the son of Jesse give you all fields and vineyards, and make you all tribunes and centurions: that all of you have conspired against me, and there is no one to inform me,\" did Doeg the Edomite say anything but the truth, when he told him: \"I saw the son of Jesse in Nob, with Abimelech the son of Ahitub the priest, who consulted the Lord for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him also the sword of Goliath the Philistine?\"[fn-59-P5941_2105735:30-nf] For which true story he deserved to be rooted up out of the land of the living, and it is said of him by the prophet: \"Wherefore God shall destroy thee forever, and pluck thee up and tear thee out of thy tabernacle, and thy root from the land of the living:\"[fn-59-P5942_2106018:31-nf] He then for showing the truth is forever plucked and rooted up out of that land in which the harlot Rahab with her family is planted for her lie: just as also we remember that Samson most injuriously betrayed to his wicked wife the truth which he had hidden for a long time by a lie, and therefore the truth so inconside-rately disclosed was the cause of his own deception, because he had neglected to keep the command of the prophet: \"Keep the doors of thy mouth from her that sleepeth in thy bosom.\"[fn-59-P5943_2106543:32-nf] ","title":"XVII.

For the gain to the Apostle Paul from his strictness would not have counterbalanced the loss to all nations from his speedy death. And this would certainly have been then incurred by the whole Church unless this good and salutary hypocrisy had preserved him for the preaching of the Gospel. For then we may rightly and pardonably acquiesce in the wrong of a lie, when, as we said, a greater harm depends on telling the truth, and when the good which results to us from speaking the truth cannot counterbalance the harm which will be caused by it. And elsewhere the blessed Apostle testifies in other words that he himself always observed this disposition; for when he says: \"To the Jews I became as a Jew that I might gain the Jews; to those who were under the law as being under the law, though not myself under the law, that I might gain those who were under the law; to those who were without law, I became as without law, though I was not without the law of God but under the law of Christ, that I might gain those who were without law; to the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I became all things to all men, that I might save all;\"[fn-59-P5931_2099236:20-nf] what does he show but that according to the weakness and the capacity of those who were being instructed he always lowered himself and relaxed something of the vigour of perfection, and did not cling to what his own strict life might seem to demand, but rather preferred that which the good of the weak might require? And that we may trace these matters out more carefully and recount one by one the glories of the good deeds of the Apostles, some one may ask how the blessed Apostle can be proved to have suited himself to all men in all things. When did he to the Jews become as a Jew? Certainly in the case where, while he still kept in his inmost heart the opinion which he had maintained to the Galatians saying: \"Behold, I, Paul, say unto you that if ye be circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing,\"[fn-59-P5932_2100068:21-nf] yet by circumcising Timothy he adopted a shadow as it were of Jewish superstition. And again, where did he become to those under the law, as under the law? There certainly where James and all the Elders of the Church, fearing lest he might be attacked by the multitude of Jewish believers, or rather of Judaizing Christians, who had received the faith of Christ in such a way as still to be bound by the rites of legal ceremonies, came to his rescue in his difficulty with this counsel and advice, and said: \"Thou seest, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews, who have believed, and they are all zealots for the law. But they have heard of thee that thou teachest those Jews who are among the Gentiles to depart from Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children;\" and below: \"Do therefore this that we say unto thee: we have four men who have a vow on them. These take and sanctify thyself with them and bestow on them, that they may shave their heads; and all will know that the things which they have heard of thee are false, but that thou thyself also walkest keeping the law.\"[fn-59-P5933_2101198:22-nf] And so for the good of those who were under the law, he trode under foot for a while the strict view which he had expressed: \"For I through the law am dead unto the law that I may live unto God;\"[fn-59-P5934_2101416:23-nf] and was driven to shave his head, and be purified according to the law and pay his vows after the Mosaic rites in the Temple.

It was to that harvest that the Lord of the harvest came, to that harvest He sent reapers; but to the Gentiles He sent not reapers, but sowers. Understand we then that it was harvest among the people of the Jews, sowing time among the peoples of the Gentiles. For out of that harvest were the Apostles chosen, where now that the harvest was, the corn was already ripe; for there had the Prophets sown.

Would\nthat it were now given me to throw myself round (perixuqhnai) the body of\nPaul, and be riveted to the tomb, and to see the dust of that body that \"filled up that which was\nlacking\" after \"Christ\" Col. i. 24), that bore \"the marks\" (stigmata,)\n(Gal. vi. 17) that sowed the Gospel everywhere yea, the dust of that body through which he ran to and\nfro everywhere! the dust of that body through which Christ spoke, and the Light shone forth more\nbrilliant than any lightning, and the voice started out, more awful than any thunder to the devils!\nthrough which he uttered that blessed voice, saying, \"I could wish that myself were accursed, for my\nbrethren\" (Rom. ix. 3), through which he spake \"before kings, and was not ashamed!\" (Ps. cxix. 46)\nthrough which we come to know Paul through which also Paul's Master! Not so awful to us is the\nthunder, as was that voice to the demons! For if they shuddered at his clothes (Acts xix. 12), much\nmore did they at his voice. This led them away captive, this cleansed out the world, this put a stop\nto diseases, cast out vice, lifted the truth on high, had Christ riding[fn-34-P3466_3148144:10-nf] upon it, and everywhere went about with Him; and\nwhat the Cherubim were, this was Paul's voice, for as He was seated upon those Powers, so was He upon\nPaul's tongue. For it had become worthy of receiving Christ, by speaking those things only which were\nacceptable to Christ, and flying as the Seraphim to height unspeakable! for what more lofty than that\nvoice which says, \"For I am persuaded that neither Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things\npresent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate\nus from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus?\" (Rom. viii. 38, 39.) What pinions doth not this\ndiscourse seem to thee to have? what eyes? (Ez. x. 12.) It was owing to this that he said, \"for we\nare not ignorant of his devices.\" (2 Cor. ii. 11.) Owing to this did the devils flee not only at\nhearing him speak, but even at seeing his garments. This is the mouth, the dust whereof I would fain\nsee, through which Christ spake the great and secret things, and greater than in His own person, (for\nas He wrought, so He also spake greater things by the disciples,[fn-34-P3467_3149417:11-nf] ) through which the Spirit gave those wondrous\noracles to the world! For what good thing did not that mouth effect? Devils it drave out, sins it\nloosed, tyrants it muzzled, philosophers' mouths it stopped, the world it brought over to God,\nsavages it persuaded to learn wisdom, all the whole order of the earth it altered. Things in Heaven\ntoo it disposed what way it listed (1 Cor. v. 3, 4), binding whom it would, and loosing in the other\nworld, \"according unto the power given unto it.\" (2 Cor. xiii. 10.) Nor is it that mouth only, but\nthe heart too would fain see the dust of, which a man would not do wrong to call the heart of the\nworld, and a fountain of countless blessings, and a beginning, and element of our life. For the\nspirit of life was furnished out of it all, and was distributed through the members of Christ, not as\nbeing sent forth by arteries, but by a free choice of good deeds. This heart was so large, as to take\nin entire cities, and peoples, and nations. \"For my heart\" he says, \"is enlarged.\" (ib. vi. 11.) Yet\neven a heart thus large, did this very charity that enlarged it many a time straiten and oppress. For\nhe says, \"Out of much affliction (qliyewj) and anguish (sunoxhj) of heart I wrote unto you.\" (ib. ii. 4.) I were desirous to see that\nheart even after its dissolution, which burned at each one that was lost, which travailed a second\ntime with the children that had proved abortions (Gal. iv. 19), which saw God,[fn-34-P3468_3150916:12-nf] (\"for the pure in heart,\" He says, \"shall see\nGod,\") (Matt. v. 8) which became a Sacrifice, (\"for a sacrifice to God is a contrite heart,\") (Ps.\nli. 17) which was loftier than the heavens, which was wider than the world, which was brighter than\nthe sun's beam, which was warmer than fire, which was stronger than adamant, which sent forth rivers,\n(\"for rivers,\" it says, \"of living water shall flow out of his belly,\") (John vii. 38) wherein was a\nfountain springing up, and watering, not the face of the earth, but the souls of men, whence not\nrivers only, but even fountains of[fn-34-P3469_3151577:13-nf] tears,\nissued day and night, which lived the new life, not this of ours, (for \"I live,\" he says, \"yet not I,\nbut Christ liveth in me,\" (Gal. ii. 20) so Paul's heart was His heart, and a tablet of the Holy\nSpirit, and a book of grace); which trembled for the sins of others, (for I fear, he says, lest by\nany means \"I have bestowed labor upon you in vain; (ib. iv. 11) lest as the serpent beguiled Eve; (2\nCor. xi. 3) lest when I come I should find you not such as I would;\") (ib. xii. 20) which both feared\nfor itself, and was confiding too, (for I fear, he says, \"lest by any means after having preached to\nothers I myself should be a castaway,\" (1 Cor. ix. 27) And, \"I am persuaded that neither angels nor\npowers shall be able to separate us;\") (alluding to Rom. ix. 3) which was counted worthy to love\nChrist as no other man loved Him: which despised death and hell, yet was broken down by brothers'\ntears, (for he says, \"what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart?\") (Acts xxi. 13) which was most\nenduring, and yet could not bear to be absent from the Thessalonians by the space of an hour! (1\nThess. ii. 17; iii. 10.) Fain would I see the dust of hands that were in a chain, through the\nimposition of which the Spirit was furnished, through which the divine writings were written, (for\n\"behold how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand:\" (Gal. vi. 11) and again, \"The\nsalutation of me Paul with mine own hand,\") (1 Cor. xvi. 21) of those hands at the sight of which the\nserpent \"fell off into the fire.\" (Acts xxviii. 5.) Fain would I see the dust of those eyes which\nwere blinded gloriously, which recovered their sight again for the salvation of the world; which even\nin the body were counted worthy to see Christ, which saw earthly things, yet saw them not, which saw\nthe things which are not seen, which saw not sleep, which were watchful at midnight, which were not\neffected as eyes are. I would also see the dust of those feet, which ran through the world and were\nnot weary; which were bound in the stocks when the prison shook, which went through parts habitable\nor uninhabited, which walked on so many journeys. And why need I speak of single parts? Fain would I\nsee the tomb, where the armor of righteousness is laid up, the armor of light, the limbs which now\nlive, but which in life were made dead; and in all whereof Christ lived, which were crucified to the\nworld, which were Christ's members, which were clad in Christ, were a temple of the Spirit, an holy\nbuilding, \"bound in the Spirit,\" (Acts xx. 22) riveted to the fear of God, which had the marks of\nChrist. This body is a wall to that City, which is safer than all towers, and than thousands of\nbattlements. And with it is that of Peter. For he honored him while alive. For he \"went up to see\nPeter.\" (Gal. i. 18) and therefore even when departed grace deigned to give him the same abode with\nhim. Fain would I see the spiritual Lion. For as a lion breathing (Gr. sending,) (Cant. ii. 15) forth\nfire (pur afieij) upon the herds of foxes, so rushed he upon the clan of\ndemons and philosophers, and as the burst of some thunderbolt, was borne down into the host of the\ndevil. (Luke xiii. 32.) For he did not even come to set the battle in array against him, since he\nfeared so and trembled at him, as that if he saw his shadow, and heard his voice, he fled even at a\ndistance. And so did he deliver over to him the fornicator, though at a distance, and again snatched\nhim out of his hands (1 Cor. v. 5, 2 Cor. ii. 7, 11); and so others also, that they might be taught\n\"not to blaspheme.\" (1 Tim. i. 20.) And consider how he sent forth his own liegemen against him,\nrousing them, suppling them. And at one time he says to the Ephesians, \"We wrestle not against flesh\nand blood, but against principalities and powers.\" (Eph. vi. 12.) Then too he puts our prize in\nheavenly places. For we struggle not for things of the earth, he says, but for Heaven, and the things\nin the Heavens. And to others, he says, \"Know ye not that we shall judge Angels? how much more the\nthings of this life?\" (1 Cor. vi. 3.) Let us then, laying all this to heart, stand nobly; for Paul\nwas a man, partaking of the same nature with us, and having everything else in common with us. But\nbecause he showed such great love toward Christ, he went up above the Heavens, and stood with the\nAngels. And so if we too would rouse ourselves up some little, and kindle in ourselves that fire, we\nshall be able to emulate that holy man. For were this impossible, he would never have cried aloud,\nand said, \"Be ye imitators of me, as I am of Christ.\" (1 Cor. xi. 1.) Let us not then admire him\nonly, or be struck with him only, but imitate him, that we too may, when we depart hence, be counted\nworthy to see him, and to share the glory unutterable, which God grant that we may all attain to by\nthe grace and love toward man of our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom, and with Whom, be glory to the\nFather, with the Holy Ghost, now and evermore.

For if when here he loved men so, that when he had the choice of departing\nand being with Christ, he chose to be here, much more will he there display a warmer affection.

I were desirous to see that\nheart even after its dissolution, which burned at each one that was lost, which travailed a second\ntime with the children that had proved abortions (Gal. iv. 19), which saw God,[fn-34-P3468_3150916:12-nf] (\"for the pure in heart,\" He says, \"shall see\nGod,\") (Matt. v. 8) which became a Sacrifice, (\"for a sacrifice to God is a contrite heart,\") (Ps.\nli. 17) which was loftier than the heavens, which was wider than the world, which was brighter than\nthe sun's beam, which was warmer than fire, which was stronger than adamant, which sent forth rivers,\n(\"for rivers,\" it says, \"of living water shall flow out of his belly,\") (John vii. 38) wherein was a\nfountain springing up, and watering, not the face of the earth, but the souls of men, whence not\nrivers only, but even fountains of[fn-34-P3469_3151577:13-nf] tears,\nissued day and night, which lived the new life, not this of ours, (for \"I live,\" he says, \"yet not I,\nbut Christ liveth in me,\" (Gal. ii. 20) so Paul's heart was His heart, and a tablet of the Holy\nSpirit, and a book of grace); which trembled for the sins of others, (for I fear, he says, lest by\nany means \"I have bestowed labor upon you in vain; (ib. iv. 11) lest as the serpent beguiled Eve; (2\nCor. xi. 3) lest when I come I should find you not such as I would;\") (ib. xii. 20) which both feared\nfor itself, and was confiding too, (for I fear, he says, \"lest by any means after having preached to\nothers I myself should be a castaway,\" (1 Cor. ix. 27) And, \"I am persuaded that neither angels nor\npowers shall be able to separate us;\") (alluding to Rom. ix. 3) which was counted worthy to love\nChrist as no other man loved Him: which despised death and hell, yet was broken down by brothers'\ntears, (for he says, \"what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart?\") (Acts xxi. 13) which was most\nenduring, and yet could not bear to be absent from the Thessalonians by the space of an hour! (1\nThess. ii. 17; iii. 10.) Fain would I see the dust of hands that were in a chain, through the\nimposition of which the Spirit was furnished, through which the divine writings were written, (for\n\"behold how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand:\" (Gal. vi. 11) and again, \"The\nsalutation of me Paul with mine own hand,\") (1 Cor. xvi. 21) of those hands at the sight of which the\nserpent \"fell off into the fire.\" (Acts xxviii. 5.) Fain would I see the dust of those eyes which\nwere blinded gloriously, which recovered their sight again for the salvation of the world; which even\nin the body were counted worthy to see Christ, which saw earthly things, yet saw them not, which saw\nthe things which are not seen, which saw not sleep, which were watchful at midnight, which were not\neffected as eyes are. I would also see the dust of those feet, which ran through the world and were\nnot weary; which were bound in the stocks when the prison shook, which went through parts habitable\nor uninhabited, which walked on so many journeys. And why need I speak of single parts? Fain would I\nsee the tomb, where the armor of righteousness is laid up, the armor of light, the limbs which now\nlive, but which in life were made dead; and in all whereof Christ lived, which were crucified to the\nworld, which were Christ's members, which were clad in Christ, were a temple of the Spirit, an holy\nbuilding, \"bound in the Spirit,\" (Acts xx. 22) riveted to the fear of God, which had the marks of\nChrist. This body is a wall to that City, which is safer than all towers, and than thousands of\nbattlements. And with it is that of Peter. For he honored him while alive. For he \"went up to see\nPeter.\" (Gal. i. 18) and therefore even when departed grace deigned to give him the same abode with\nhim. Fain would I see the spiritual Lion. For as a lion breathing (Gr. sending,) (Cant. ii. 15) forth\nfire (pur afieij) upon the herds of foxes, so rushed he upon the clan of\ndemons and philosophers, and as the burst of some thunderbolt, was borne down into the host of the\ndevil. (Luke xiii. 32.) For he did not even come to set the battle in array against him, since he\nfeared so and trembled at him, as that if he saw his shadow, and heard his voice, he fled even at a\ndistance. And so did he deliver over to him the fornicator, though at a distance, and again snatched\nhim out of his hands (1 Cor. v. 5, 2 Cor. ii. 7, 11); and so others also, that they might be taught\n\"not to blaspheme.\" (1 Tim. i. 20.) And consider how he sent forth his own liegemen against him,\nrousing them, suppling them. And at one time he says to the Ephesians, \"We wrestle not against flesh\nand blood, but against principalities and powers.\" (Eph. vi. 12.) Then too he puts our prize in\nheavenly places. For we struggle not for things of the earth, he says, but for Heaven, and the things\nin the Heavens. And to others, he says, \"Know ye not that we shall judge Angels? how much more the\nthings of this life?\" (1 Cor. vi. 3.) Let us then, laying all this to heart, stand nobly; for Paul\nwas a man, partaking of the same nature with us, and having everything else in common with us. But\nbecause he showed such great love toward Christ, he went up above the Heavens, and stood with the\nAngels. And so if we too would rouse ourselves up some little, and kindle in ourselves that fire, we\nshall be able to emulate that holy man. For were this impossible, he would never have cried aloud,\nand said, \"Be ye imitators of me, as I am of Christ.\" (1 Cor. xi. 1.) Let us not then admire him\nonly, or be struck with him only, but imitate him, that we too may, when we depart hence, be counted\nworthy to see him, and to share the glory unutterable, which God grant that we may all attain to by\nthe grace and love toward man of our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom, and with Whom, be glory to the\nFather, with the Holy Ghost, now and evermore. Amen.parparpar","title":"Homily XXXII.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":2,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_96_homily_xxxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"Who is there then to pray over us, since Paul hath departed? These who[fn-34-P3461_3142052:5-nf] are the imitators of Paul. Only let us yield\nourselves worthy of such intercession (sunhgoriaj), that it may not be\nthat we hear Paul's voice here only, but that hereafter, when we are departed, we may be counted\nworthy to see the wrestler of Christ.[fn-34-P3462_3142363:6-nf] Or\nrather, if we hear him here, we shall certainly see him hereafter, if not as standing near him, yet\nsee him we certainly shall, glistening near the Throne of the king.[fn-34-P3463_3142728:7-nf] Where the Cherubim sing the glory, where the\nSeraphim are flying, there shall we see Paul, with Peter, and as a chief[fn-34-P3464_3143013:8-nf] and leader of the choir of the Saints, and shall\nenjoy his generous love. For if when here he loved men so, that when he had the choice of departing\nand being with Christ, he chose to be here, much more will he there display a warmer affection. I\nlove Rome even for this, although indeed one has other grounds for praising it, both for its\ngreatness, and its antiquity, and its beauty, and its populousness, and for its power, and its\nwealth, and for its successes in war. But I let all this pass, and esteem it blessed on this account,\nthat both in his lifetime he wrote to them, and loved them so, and talked with them whiles he was\nwith us, and brought his life to a close there.[fn-34-P3465_3146056:9-nf] Wherefore the city is more notable upon this\nground, than upon all others together. And as a body great and strong, it hath as two glistening eyes\nthe bodies of these Saints. Not so bright is the heaven, when the sun sends forth his rays, as is the\ncity of Rome, sending out these two lights into all parts of the world. From thence will Paul be\ncaught up, from thence Peter. Just bethink you, and shudder (fricate) at\nthe thought of what a sight Rome will see, when Paul ariseth suddenly from that deposit, together\nwith Peter, and is lifted up to meet the Lord. (1 Thess. iv. 17.) What a rose will Rome send up to\nChrist! (Is. xxxv. 1) what two crowns will the city have about it! what golden chains will she be\ngirded with! what fountains possess! Therefore I admire the city, not for the much gold, not for the\ncolumns, not for the other display there, but for these pillars of the Church. (1 Cor. xv. 38.) Would\nthat it were now given me to throw myself round (perixuqhnai) the body of\nPaul, and be riveted to the tomb, and to see the dust of that body that \"filled up that which was\nlacking\" after \"Christ\" Col. i. 24), that bore \"the marks\" (stigmata,)\n(Gal. vi. 17) that sowed the Gospel everywhere yea, the dust of that body through which he ran to and\nfro everywhere! the dust of that body through which Christ spoke, and the Light shone forth more\nbrilliant than any lightning, and the voice started out, more awful than any thunder to the devils!\nthrough which he uttered that blessed voice, saying, \"I could wish that myself were accursed, for my\nbrethren\" (Rom. ix. 3), through which he spake \"before kings, and was not ashamed!\" (Ps. cxix. 46)\nthrough which we come to know Paul through which also Paul's Master! Not so awful to us is the\nthunder, as was that voice to the demons! For if they shuddered at his clothes (Acts xix. 12), much\nmore did they at his voice. This led them away captive, this cleansed out the world, this put a stop\nto diseases, cast out vice, lifted the truth on high, had Christ riding[fn-34-P3466_3148144:10-nf] upon it, and everywhere went about with Him; and\nwhat the Cherubim were, this was Paul's voice, for as He was seated upon those Powers, so was He upon\nPaul's tongue. For it had become worthy of receiving Christ, by speaking those things only which were\nacceptable to Christ, and flying as the Seraphim to height unspeakable! for what more lofty than that\nvoice which says, \"For I am persuaded that neither Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things\npresent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate\nus from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus?\" (Rom. viii. 38, 39.) What pinions doth not this\ndiscourse seem to thee to have? what eyes? (Ez. x. 12.) It was owing to this that he said, \"for we\nare not ignorant of his devices.\" (2 Cor. ii. 11.) Owing to this did the devils flee not only at\nhearing him speak, but even at seeing his garments. This is the mouth, the dust whereof I would fain\nsee, through which Christ spake the great and secret things, and greater than in His own person, (for\nas He wrought, so He also spake greater things by the disciples,[fn-34-P3467_3149417:11-nf] ) through which the Spirit gave those wondrous\noracles to the world! For what good thing did not that mouth effect? Devils it drave out, sins it\nloosed, tyrants it muzzled, philosophers' mouths it stopped, the world it brought over to God,\nsavages it persuaded to learn wisdom, all the whole order of the earth it altered. Things in Heaven\ntoo it disposed what way it listed (1 Cor. v. 3, 4), binding whom it would, and loosing in the other\nworld, \"according unto the power given unto it.\" (2 Cor. xiii. 10.) Nor is it that mouth only, but\nthe heart too would fain see the dust of, which a man would not do wrong to call the heart of the\nworld, and a fountain of countless blessings, and a beginning, and element of our life. For the\nspirit of life was furnished out of it all, and was distributed through the members of Christ, not as\nbeing sent forth by arteries, but by a free choice of good deeds. This heart was so large, as to take\nin entire cities, and peoples, and nations. \"For my heart\" he says, \"is enlarged.\" (ib. vi. 11.) Yet\neven a heart thus large, did this very charity that enlarged it many a time straiten and oppress. For\nhe says, \"Out of much affliction (qliyewj) and anguish (sunoxhj) of heart I wrote unto you.\" (ib. ii. 4.) I were desirous to see that\nheart even after its dissolution, which burned at each one that was lost, which travailed a second\ntime with the children that had proved abortions (Gal. iv. 19), which saw God,[fn-34-P3468_3150916:12-nf] (\"for the pure in heart,\" He says, \"shall see\nGod,\") (Matt. v. 8) which became a Sacrifice, (\"for a sacrifice to God is a contrite heart,\") (Ps.\nli. 17) which was loftier than the heavens, which was wider than the world, which was brighter than\nthe sun's beam, which was warmer than fire, which was stronger than adamant, which sent forth rivers,\n(\"for rivers,\" it says, \"of living water shall flow out of his belly,\") (John vii. 38) wherein was a\nfountain springing up, and watering, not the face of the earth, but the souls of men, whence not\nrivers only, but even fountains of[fn-34-P3469_3151577:13-nf] tears,\nissued day and night, which lived the new life, not this of ours, (for \"I live,\" he says, \"yet not I,\nbut Christ liveth in me,\" (Gal. ii. 20) so Paul's heart was His heart, and a tablet of the Holy\nSpirit, and a book of grace); which trembled for the sins of others, (for I fear, he says, lest by\nany means \"I have bestowed labor upon you in vain; (ib. iv. 11) lest as the serpent beguiled Eve; (2\nCor. xi. 3) lest when I come I should find you not such as I would;\") (ib. xii. 20) which both feared\nfor itself, and was confiding too, (for I fear, he says, \"lest by any means after having preached to\nothers I myself should be a castaway,\" (1 Cor. ix. 27) And, \"I am persuaded that neither angels nor\npowers shall be able to separate us;\") (alluding to Rom. ix. 3) which was counted worthy to love\nChrist as no other man loved Him: which despised death and hell, yet was broken down by brothers'\ntears, (for he says, \"what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart?\") (Acts xxi. 13) which was most\nenduring, and yet could not bear to be absent from the Thessalonians by the space of an hour!

For he did not even come to set the battle in array against him, since he\nfeared so and trembled at him, as that if he saw his shadow, and heard his voice, he fled even at a\ndistance. And so did he deliver over to him the fornicator, though at a distance, and again snatched\nhim out of his hands (1 Cor. v. 5, 2 Cor. ii. 7, 11); and so others also, that they might be taught\n\"not to blaspheme.\" (1 Tim. i. 20.) And consider how he sent forth his own liegemen against him,\nrousing them, suppling them. And at one time he says to the Ephesians, \"We wrestle not against flesh\nand blood, but against principalities and powers.\" (Eph. vi. 12.) Then too he puts our prize in\nheavenly places.

For that is the true life, which a man lives in Christ; for although they are dead to the world, yet they dwell as it were in heaven, minding those things which are above, as he who was a lover of such a habitation said, `While we walk on earth, our dwelling is in heaven[fn-91-P9152_3330946:21-nf] .'

As it is called, \"The Lord's salvation,\"[fn-63-P6306_2666408:34-nf] not whereby the Lord is saved, but which He giveth to them whom He saveth; so too the grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord is called the righteousness of God, not as that whereby the Lord is righteous, but whereby He justifieth those whom of ungodly He maketh righteous. But some, as the Jews in former times, both wish to be called Christians, and still ignorant of God's righteousness, desire to establish their own, even in our own times, in the times of open grace, the times of the full revelation of grace which before was hidden; in the times of grace now manifested in the floor, which once lay hid in the fleece. I see that a few have understood me, that more have not understood, whom I will by no means defraud by keeping silence. Gideon, one of the righteous men of old, asked for a sign from the Lord, and said, \"I pray, Lord, that this fleece which I put in the floor be bedewed,[fn-63-P6307_2667359:35-nf] and that the floor be dry.\"[fn-63-P6308_2667404:36-nf] And it was so; the fleece was bedewed, the whole floor was dry. In the morning he wrung out tim fleece in a basin; forasmuch as to the humble is grace given; and in a basin, ye know what the Lord did to His disciples. Again, he asked for another sign; \"O Lord, I would,\" saith he, \"that the fleece be dry, the floor bedewed.\" And it was so. Call to mind the time of the Old Testament, grace was hidden in a cloud, as the rain in the fleece. Mark now the time of the New Testament, consider well the nation of the Jews, thou wilt find it as a dry fleece; whereas the whole world, like that floor, is full of grace, not hidden, but manifested. Wherefore we are forced exceedingly to bewail our brethren, who strive not against hidden, but against open and manifested grace. There is allowance for the Jews. What shall we say of Christians? Wherefore are ye enemies to the grace of Christ? Why rely ye on yourselves? Why unthankful? For why did Christ come? Was not nature here before? Was not nature here, which ye only deceive by your excessive praise? Was not the Law here? But the Apostle says, \"If righteousness come by the Law, then Christ is dead in vain.\"[fn-63-P6309_2668584:37-nf] What the Apostle says of the Law, that say we of nature to these men. \"If righteousness come by nature, then Christ is dead in vain.\"","title":"Sermon LXXXI.

But still, possessed as Judas now was, not by the Lord, but by the devil, and now that the bread had entered the belly, and an enemy the soul of this man of ingratitude: still, I say, there was this enormous wickedness, already conceived in his heart, waiting to be wrought out to its full issue, for which the damnable desire had always preceded. Accordingly, when the Lord, the living Bread, had given this bread to the dead, and in giving it had revealed the betrayer of the Bread, He said, \"What thou doest, do quickly.\" He did not command the crime, but foretold evil to Judas, and good to us. For what could be worse for judas, or what could be better for us, than the delivering up of Christ,-a deed done by him to his own destruction, but done, apart from him, in our behalf? \"What thou doest, do quickly.\" Oh that word of One whose wish was to be ready rather than to be angry! That word! expressing not so much the punishment of the traitor as the reward awaiting the Redeemer! For He said, \"What thou doest, do quickly,\" not as wrathfully looking to the destruction of the trust-betrayer, but in His own haste to accomplish the salvation of the faithful; for He was delivered for our offences,[fn-25-P2551_1510282:6-nf] and He loved the Church, and gave Himself for it.[fn-25-P2552_1510348:7-nf] And as the apostle also says of himself: \"Who loved me, and gave Himself for me.\"[fn-25-P2553_1510445:8-nf] Had not, then, Christ given Himself, no one could have givenHim up. What is there in Judas' conduct but sin? For in delivering up Christ he had no thought of our salvation,for which Christ was really delivered, but thought only of his money gain, and found the loss of his soul. He got the wages he wished, but had also given him, against his wish, the wages he merited. Judas delivered up Christ, Christ delivered Himself up: the former transacted the business of his own selling of his Master, the latter the business of our redemption. \"What thou doest, do quickly,\" not because thou hast the power in thyself, but because He wills it who has all the power.","title":"Tractate LXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_14_npnf1_14_93_homilies_on_the_epistle_to_the_hebrews","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"[1.] The blessed Paul, writing to the Romans, says, \"Inasmuch then as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office: if by any means I may provoke to emulation them that are my flesh\":[fn-52-P5241_1708863:1-nf] andagain, in another place, \"For He that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles.\"[fn-52-P5242_1709041:2-nf] If therefore he were the Apostle of the Gentiles, (for also in the Acts, God said to him, \"Depart; for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles,\"[fn-52-P5243_1709206:3-nf] ) what had he to do with the Hebrews? and why did he also write an Epistle to them?","title":"Homilies on the Epistle to the Hebrews","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":2,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_14_npnf1_14_93_homilies_on_the_epistle_to_the_hebrews","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"For as yet he was not arrested.

I wish you to know, most pious father, that in these days there has arrived in our parts a certain person named Manes, who gives out that he is to complete the doctrine of the New Testament. And in the statements which he has made there have been some things, indeed, which may harmonize with our faith; but there have been also certain affirmations of his which seem very far removed from what has come down to us by the tradition of our fathers. For he has interpreted some doctrines in a strange fashion, imposing on them certain notions of his own, which have appeared to me to be altogether foreign and opposed to the faith. On the ground of these facts I have now been induced to write this letter to you, knowing the completeness and fulness of your intelligence in doctrine, and being assured that none of these things can escape your cognizance. Accordingly, I have also indulged the confident hope that you cannot be kept back by any grudge[fn-36-P3692_1033765:413-nf] from explaining these matters to us. As to myself, indeed, it is not possible that I shall be drawn away into any novel doctrine; nevertheless, in behalf of all the less instructed, I have been led to ask a word with your authority. For, in truth, the man shows himself to be a person of extraordinary force of character, both in speech and in action; and indeed his very aspect and attire also bear that out. But I shall here write down for your information some few points which I have been able to retain in my memory out of all the topics which have been expounded by him: for I know that even by these few you will have an idea of the rest. You well understand, no doubt, that those who seek to set up any new dogma have the habit of very readily perverting into a conformity with their own notions any proofs they desire to take from the Scriptures.[fn-36-P3693_1034637:414-nf] In anticipation, however, of this, the apostolic word marks out the case thus: \"If any one preach any other gospel unto you than that which you have received, let him be accursed.\"[fn-36-P3694_1034870:415-nf] And consequently, in addition to what has been once committed to us by the apostles, a disciple of Christ ought to receive nothing new as doctrine.[fn-36-P3695_1035037:416-nf] But not to make what I have got to say too long, I return to the subject directly in view. This man then maintained that the law of Moses, to speak shortly, does not proceed from the good God, but from the prince of evil; and that it has no kinship with the new law of Christ, but is contrary and hostile to it, the one being the direct antagonist of the other. When I heard such a sentiment propounded, I repeated to the people that sentence of the Gospel in which our Lord Jesus Christ said of Himself: \"I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil it.\"[fn-36-P3696_1035912:417-nf] The man, however, averred that He did not utter this saying at all; for he held that when we find that He did abrogate[fn-36-P3697_1036051:418-nf] that same law, we are bound to give heed, above all other considerations, to the thing which He actually did. Then he began to cite a great variety of passages from the law, and also many from the Gospel and from the Apostle Paul, which have the appearance of contradicting each other. All this he gave forth at the same time with perfect confidence, and without any hesitation or fear; so that I verily believe he has that serpent as his helper, who is ever our adversary. Well, he declared that there in the law God said, \"I make the rich man and the poor man; \"[fn-36-P3698_1036635:419-nf] while here in the Gospel Jesus called the poor blessed,[fn-36-P3699_1036713:420-nf] and added, that no man could be His disciple unless he gave up all that he had.[fn-37-P3700_1036812:421-nf] Again, he maintained that there Moses took silver and gold from the Egyptians when the people[fn-37-P3701_1036927:422-nf] fled out of Egypt;[fn-37-P3702_1037005:423-nf] whereas Jesus delivered the precept that we should lust after nothing belonging to our neighbour. Then he affirmed that Moses had provided in the law, that an eye should be given in penalty for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;[fn-37-P3703_1037252:424-nf] but that our Lord bade us offer the other cheek also to him who smote the one.[fn-37-P3704_1037351:425-nf] He told us, too, that there Moses commanded the man to be punished and stoned who did any work on the Sabbath, and who failed to continue in all things that were written in the law,[fn-37-P3705_1037553:426-nf] as in fact was done to that person who, yet being ignorant, had gathered a bundle of sticks on the Sabbath-day; whereas Jesus cured a cripple on the Sabbath, and ordered him then also to take up his bed.[fn-37-P3706_1037777:427-nf] And further, He did not restrain His disciples from plucking the ears of corn and rubbing them with their hands on the Sabbath-day,[fn-37-P3707_1037929:428-nf] which yet was a thing which it was unlawful to do on the Sabbaths. And why should I mention other instances? For with many different assertions of a similar nature these dogmas of his were propounded with the utmost energy and the most fervid zeal. Thus, too, on the authority of an apostle, he endeavoured to establish the position that the law of Moses is the law of death, and that the law of Jesus, on the contrary, is the law of life. For he based that assertion on the passage which runs thus: \"In which also may God make us[fn-37-P3708_1038479:429-nf] able ministers of the New Testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. But if the ministration of death, engraven in letters on the stones,[fn-37-P3709_1038695:430-nf] was made in glory, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away; how shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious? For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. For if that which shall be done away is glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.\"[fn-37-P3710_1039283:431-nf] And this passage, as you are also well aware, occurs in the second Epistle to the Corinthians. Besides, he added to this another passage out of the first epistle, on which he based his affirmation that the disciples of the Old Testament were earthly and natural; and in accordance with this, that flesh and blood could not possess the kingdom of God.[fn-37-P3711_1039659:432-nf] He also maintained that Paul himself spoke in his own proper person when he said: \"If I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.\"[fn-37-P3712_1039845:433-nf] Further, he averred that the same apostle made this statement most obviously on the subject of the resurrection of the flesh. when he also said that \"he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh,\"[fn-37-P3713_1040114:434-nf] and that according to the letter the law has in it no advantage.[fn-37-P3714_1040199:435-nf] And again he adduced the statement, that \"Abraham has glory, but not before God; \"[fn-37-P3715_1040301:436-nf] and that \"by the law there comes only the knowledge of sin.\"[fn-37-P3716_1040381:437-nf] And many other things did he introduce, with the view of detracting from the honour of the law, on the ground that the law itself is sin; by which statements the simpler people were somewhat influenced, as he continued to bring them forward; and in accordance with all this, he also made use of the affirmation, that \"the law and the prophets were until John.\"[fn-37-P3717_1040764:438-nf] He declared, however, that John preached the true kingdom of heaven; for verily he held, that by the cutting off of his head it was signified that all who went before him, and who had precedence over him, were to be cut off, and that what was to come after him was alone to be maintained. With reference to all these things, therefore, O most pious Archelaus, send us back a short reply in writing: for I have heard that you have studied such matters in no ordinary degree; and that capacity which you possess is God's gift, inasmuch as God bestows these gifts upon those who are worthy of them, and who are His friends, and who show themselves allied to Him in community of purpose and life. For it is our part to prepare ourselves, and to approach the gracious and liberal mind,[fn-37-P3718_1041566:439-nf] and forthwith we receive from it the most bountiful gifts. Accordingly, since the learning which I possess for the discussion of themes like these does not meet the requirements of my desire and purpose, for I confess myself to he an unlearned man, I have sent to you, as I have already said more than once, in the hope of obtaining from your hand the amplest solution to this question. May it be well with you, incomparable and honourable father!","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":2,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_89_tractate_lxxxiv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"2. But let us not be supposed to have so spoken as if on such grounds we might possibly arrive at an equality with Christ the Lord, if for His sake we have undergone witness-bearing even unto blood. He had power to lay down His life, and to take it again;[fn-29-P2944_1682230:4-nf] but we have no power to live as long as we wish; and die we must, however unwilling: He, by dying, straightway slew death in Himself; we, by His death, are delivered from death: His flesh saw no corruption;[fn-29-P2945_1682453:5-nf] ours, after corruption, shall in the end of the world be clothed by Him with incorruption: He had no need of us, in order to work out our salvation; we, without Him, can do nothing: He gave Himself as the vine, to us the branches; we, apart from Him, can have no life. Lastly, although brethren die for brethren, yet no martyr's blood is ever shed for the remission of the sins of brethren, as was the case in what He did for us; and in this respect He bestowed not on us aught for imitation, but something for congratulation. In as far, then, as the martyrs have shed their blood for the brethren, so far have they exhibited such tokens of love as they themselves perceived at the table of the Lord. (One might imitate Him in dying, but no one could, in redeeming.)[fn-29-P2946_1683236:6-nf] In all else, then, that I have said, although it is out of my power to mention everything, the martyr of Christ is far inferior to Christ Himself. But if any one shall set himself in comparison, I say, not with the power. but with the innocence of Christ, and (I would not say) in thinking that he is healing the sins of others, but at least that he has no sins of his own, even so far is his avidity overstepping the requirements of the method of salvation; it is a matter of considerable moment for him, only he attains not his desire. And well it is that he is admonished in that passage of the Proverbs, which immediately goes on to say, \"But if thy greed is too great, be not desirous of his dainties; for it is better that thou take nothing thereof, than that thou shouldst take more than is befitting. For such things,\" it is added, \"have a life of deceit,\" that is, of hypocrisy. For in asserting his own sinlessness,he cannot prove, but only pretend, that he is righteous. And so it is said,\" For such have a deceiving life.\" There is only One who could at once have human flesh and be free from sin. Appropriately are we commanded that which follows; and such a word and proverb is well adapted to human weakness, when it is said, \"Lay not thyself out, seeing thou art poor, against him that is rich.\" For the rich man is Christ, who was never obnoxious to punishment either through hereditary or personal debt and is righteous Himself, and justifies others. Lay not thyself out against Him, thou who art so poor, that thou art manifestly to the eyes of all the daily beggar that thou art in thy prayer for the remission of sins. \"But keep thyself,\" he says, \"from thine own counsel\" [\"cease from thine own wisdom\"-E. V.]. From what, but from this delusive presumption? For He, indeed, inasmuch as He is not only man but also God, can never be chargeable with evil. \"For if thou turn thine eye upon Him, He will nowhere be visible.\" \"Thine eye,\" that is, the human eye, wherewith thou distinguishest that which is human; \"if thou turn it upon Him, He will nowhere be visible,\" because He cannot be seen with such organs of sight as are thine. \"For He will provide Himself wings like an eagle's, and will depart to the house of His overseer,\"[fn-29-P2947_1685753:7-nf] from which, at all events, He came to us, and found us not such as He Himself was who came. Let us therefore love one another, even as Christ hath loved us, and given Himself for us.[fn-29-P2948_1686755:8-nf] \"For greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\" And let us be imitating Him in such a spirit of reverential obedience, that we shall never have the boldness to presume on a comparison between Him and ourselves.","title":"Tractate LXXXIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_61_homily_xvii_","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"60","folder":"ANF-08","text":"\"If, then, our Jesus appeared to you in a vision, made Himself known to you, and spoke to you, it was as one who is enraged with an adversary; and this is the reason why it was through visions and dreams, or through revelations that were from without, that He spoke to you.

Neither must we prescribe this from custom, but overcome opposite custom by reason.

Paul, moreover, looking forward to this, and consulting faithfully for concord and peace, has laid down in his epistle this rule: \"Moreover, let the prophets speak two or three, and let the rest judge.
