{"verses":["Brethren, and if a man be overtaken in any fault, you, who are\nspiritual, instruct such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering\nthyself, lest thou also be tempted.","Bear ye one another's burdens:  and so you shall fulfil the law of\nChrist.","For if any man think himself to be some thing, whereas he is\nnothing, he deceiveth himself.","But let every one prove his own work:  and so he shall have glory\nin himself only and not in another.","For every one shall bear his own burden.","And let him that is instructed in the word communicate to him that\ninstructeth him, in all good things.","Be not deceived:  God is not mocked.","For what things a man shall sow, those also shall he reap.  For he\nthat soweth in his flesh of the flesh also shall reap corruption.  But\nhe that soweth in the spirit of the spirit shall reap life everlasting.","And in doing good, let us not fail.  For in due time we shall reap,\nnot failing.","Therefore, whilst we have time, let us work good to all men, but\nespecially to those who are of the household of the faith.","See what a letter I have written to you with my own hand.","For as many as desire to please in the flesh, they constrain you\nto be circumcised, only that they may not suffer the persecution of the\ncross of Christ.","For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law:  but\nthey will have you to be circumcised, that they may glory in your\nflesh.","But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord\nJesus Christ:  by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.","For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor\nuncircumcision:  but a new creature.","And whosoever shall follow this rule, peace on them and mercy:\nand upon the Israel of God.","From henceforth let no man be troublesome to me:  for I bear the\nmarks of the Lord Jesus in my body.","The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren.\nAmen."]}
