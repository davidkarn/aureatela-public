Similar evidence has been collected also concerning the Holy Spirit, of which those who have discussed the subject before ourselves have most fully availed themselves, that He too is God, and not a creature. But if not a creature, then not only God (for men likewise are called gods[fn-2-P238_83452:44-nf] ), but also very God; and therefore absolutely equal with the Father and the Son, and in the unity of the Trinity consubstantial and co-eternal. But that the Holy Spirit is not a creature is made quite plain by that passage above all others, where we are commanded not to serve the creature, but the Creator;[fn-2-P239_83782:45-nf] not in the sense in which we are commanded to \"serve\" one another by love,[fn-2-P240_83874:46-nf] which is in Greek douleuein, but in that in which God alone is served, which is in Greek latreuein. From whence they are called idolaters who tender that service to images which is due to God. For it is this service concerning which it is said, \"Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.\"[fn-2-P241_84207:47-nf] For this is found also more distinctly in the Greek Scriptures, which have latreuseij. Now if we are forbidden to serve the creature with such a service, seeing that it is written, \"Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve\" (and hence, too, the apostle repudiates those who worship and serve the creature more than the Creator), then assuredly the Holy Spirit is not a creature, to whom such a service is paid by all the saints; as says the apostle, \"For we are the circumcision, which serve the Spirit of God,\"[fn-2-P242_84764:48-nf] which is in the Greek latreuontej. For even most Latin copies also have it thus, \"We who serve the Spirit of God;\" but all Greek ones, or almost all, have it so. Although in some Latin copies we find, not \"We worship the Spirit of God,\" but, \"We worship God in the Spirit.\" But let those who err in this case, and refuse to give up to the more weighty authority, tell us whether they find this text also varied in the mss.: \"Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which ye have of God?\" Yet what can be more senseless or more profane, than that any one should dare to say that the members of Christ are the temple of one who, in their opinion, is a creature inferior to Christ? For the apostle says in another place, \"Your bodies are members of Christ.\" But if the members of Christ are also the temple of the Holy Spirit, then the Holy Spirit is not a creature; because we must needs owe to Him, of whom our body is the temple, that service wherewith God only is to be served, which in Greek is called latreia.

It is burdened with much repetition; subjects, especially, which have been treated in books ii. and iii. are discussed again at great length in later books[fn-2-P225_158313:89-nf] . The frequent stress laid upon the infinity of God, the limitations of human speech and knowledge, the consequent incompleteness of the argument from analogy, the humility necessary when dealing with infinities apparently opposed[fn-2-P226_158610:90-nf] , though it adds to the solemnity of the writer's tone and was doubtless necessary when the work was published in parts, becomes somewhat tedious in the course of a continuous reading. And something must here be said of the peculiarities of style. We saw that in places, as for instance in the beginning of the De Trinitate, Hilary can rise to a singularly lofty eloquence. This eloquence is not merely the unstudied utterance of an earnest faith, but the expression given to it by one whom natural talent and careful training had made a master of literary form. Yet, since his training was that of an age whose standard of taste was far from classical purity, much that must have seemed to him and to his contemporaries to be admirably effective can excite no admiration now. He prays, at the end of the first book, that his diction may be worthy of his theme, and doubtless his effort was as sincere as his prayer. Had there been less effort, there would certainly, in the judgment of a modern reader, have been more success. But he could not foresee the future, and ingenious affectations such as occur at the end of book viii. § I, impietati insolenti, et insolentiae vaniloquae, et vaniloquio seducenti, with the jingle of rhymes which follows, are too frequent for our taste in his pages[fn-2-P227_159962:91-nf] , Sometimes we find purple patches which remind us of the rhetoric of Apuleius[fn-2-P228_160097:92-nf] ; sometimes an excessive display of symmetry and antithesis, which suggests to us St. Cyprian at his worst. Yet Cyprian had the excuse that all his writings are short occasional papers written for immediate effect; neither he, nor any Latin Christian before Hilary, had ventured to construct a great treatise of theology, intended to influence future ages as well as the present. Another excessive development of rhetoric is the abuse of apostrophe, which Hilary sometimes rides almost to death, as in his addresses to the Fisherman, St. John, in the second book[fn-2-P229_160680:93-nf] . These blemishes, however, do not seriously affect his intelligibility. He has earned, in this as in greater matters, an unhappy reputation for obscurity, which he has, to a certain extent, deserved. His other writings, even the Commentary on St. Matthew, are free from the involved language which sometimes makes the De Trinitate hard to understand, and often hard to read with pleasure. When Hilary was appealing to the Emperor, or addressing his own flock, as in the Homilies on the Psalms, he has command of a style which is always clear, stately on occasion, never weak or bald; in these cases he resisted, or did not feel, the temptation to use the resources of his rhetoric. These, unfortunately, had for then result the production of sentences which are often marvels of grammatical contortion and elliptical ingenuity. Yet such sentences, though numerous, are of few and uniform types. In Hilary's case, as in that of Tertullian, familiarity makes the reader so accustomed to them that he instinctively expects their recurrence; and, at their worst, they are never actual breaches of the laws of the language. A translator can hardly be an impartial judge in this matter, for constantly, in passages where the sense is perfectly clear, the ingenuity with which words and constructions are arranged makes it almost impossible to render their meaning in idiomatic terms. One can translate him out of Latin, but not into English. In this he resembles one of the many styles of St. Augustine. There are passages in the De Trinitate, for instance viii. 27, 28, which it would seem thatAugustine had deliberately imitated; a course natural enough in the case of one who was deeply indebted to his predecessor's thought, and must have looked with reverence upon the great pioneer of systematic theology in the Latin tongue. But this involution of style, irritating as it sometimes is, has the compensating advantage that it keeps the reader constantly on the alert. He cannot skim these pages in the comfortable delusion that he is following the course of thought without an effort.","title":"Introduction","author":false},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_11_disputation_of_the_second_day_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"Fortunatus said: We say this, that the soul is compelled by contrary nature to transgress, for which transgression you maintain there is no root save the evil that dwells in us; for it is certain that apart from our bodies evil things dwell in the whole world.

Augustin said: I recognize and embrace the testimonies of the divine Scriptures, and I will show in a few words, as God may deign to grant, how they are consistent with my faith. I say that there was free exercise of will in that man who was first formed. He was so made that absolutely nothing could resist his will, if he had willed to keep the precepts of God. But after he voluntarily sinned, we who have descended from his stock were plunged into necessity. But each one of us can by a little consideration find that what I say is true. For today in our actions before we are implicated by any habit, we have free choice of doing anything or not doing it. But when by that liberty we have done something and the pernicious sweetness and pleasure of that deed has taken hold upon the mind, by its own habit the mind is so implicated that afterwards it cannot conquer what by sinning it has fashioned for itself. We see many who do not wish to swear, but because the tongue has already become habituated, they are not able to prevent those things from going forth from the mouth which we cannot but ascribe to the root of evil. For that I may discuss with you those words, which as they do not withdraw from your mouth so may they be understood by your heart: you swear by the Paraclete. If therefore you wish to find out experimentally whether what I say is true, determine not to swear. You will see, that that habit is borne along as it has become accustomed to be. And this is what wars against the soul, habit formed in the flesh. This is indeed the mind of the flesh, which, as long as it cannot thus be subject to the law of God, so long is it the mind of the flesh; but when the soul has been illuminated it ceases to be the mind of the flesh. For thus it is said the mind of the flesh cannot be subject to the law of God, just as if it were said, that snow cannot be warm. Far so long as it is snow, it can in no way be warm. But as the snow is melted by heat, so that it may become warm, so the mind of the flesh, that is, habit formed with the flesh, when our mind has become illuminated, that is, when God has subjected for Himself the whole man to the choice of the divine law, instead of the evil habit of the soul, makes a good habit. Accordingly it is most truly said by the Lord of the two trees, the one good and the other evil, which you have called to mind, that they have their own fruits; that is, neither can the good tree yield evil fruit, nor the evil tree good fruit, but so long as it is evil. Let us take two men, a good and a bad. As long as he is good he cannot yield evil fruit; as long as he is bad he cannot yield good fruit. But that you may know that those two trees are so placed by the Lord, that free choice may be there signified, that these two trees are not natures but our wills, He Himself says in the gospel: \"Either make the tree good, or make the tree evil.\"[fn-9-P904_473740:9-nf] Who is it that can make nature? If therefore we are commanded to make a tree either good or evil, it is ours to choose what we will. Therefore concerning that sin of man and concerning that habit of soul formed with the flesh the apostle says: \"Let no one seduce you;\"[fn-9-P905_474028:10-nf] \"Every creature that has been made by God is good.\"[fn-9-P906_474096:11-nf] The same apostle whom you also have cited says: \"As through the disobedience of the one the many were constituted sinners; so also through the obedience of the one the many are constituted righteous.\"[fn-9-P907_474316:12-nf] \"Since through man is death, through man also is resurrection of the dead.\" As long therefore as we bear the image of the earthly man,[fn-9-P908_474468:13-nf] that is, as long as we live according to the flesh, which is also called the old man, we have the necessity of our habit, so that we may not do what we will. But when the grace of God has breathed the divine love into us and has made us subject to His will, to us it is said: \"Ye are called for freedom,\"[fn-9-P909_474798:14-nf] and \"the grace of God has made me free from the law of sin and of death.\"[fn-9-P910_474889:15-nf] But the law of sin is that whoever has sinned shall die. From this law we are freed when we have begun to be righteous. The law of death is that by which it was said to man: \"Earth thou art and into earth thou shalt go.\"[fn-9-P911_475129:16-nf] For from this very fact we are all so born, because we are earth, and from the fact that we are all so born because we are earth, we shall all go into earth on account of the desert of the sins of the first man. But on account of the grace of God, which frees us from the law of sin and of death, having been converted to righteousness we are freed; so that afterwards this same flesh tortures us with its punishment so long as we remain in sins, is subjected to us in resurrection, and shakes us by no adversity from keeping the law of God and His precepts.

For just as in the case of runners who turn and take the second course,[fn-15-P1530_372956:304-nf] a kind of halt and pause intervenes between the movements in the opposite direction, so also inmaking a change in lives it seemed necessary for death to come as mediator between the two, ending all that goes before, and beginning all that comes after. How then do we achieve the descent into hell? By imitating, through baptism, the burial of Christ. For the bodies of the baptized are, as it were, buried in the water. Baptism then symbolically signifies the putting off of the works of the flesh; as the apostle says, ye were \"circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ; buried with him in baptism.\" And there is, as it were, a cleansing of the soul from the filth[fn-15-P1531_373733:305-nf] that has grown on it from the carnal mind,[fn-15-P1532_373982:306-nf] as it is written, \"Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.\"[fn-15-P1533_374080:307-nf] On this account we do not, as is the fashion of the Jews, wash ourselves at each defilement, but own the baptism of salvation[fn-15-P1534_374233:308-nf] to be one.[fn-15-P1535_374337:309-nf] For there the death on behalf of the world is one, and one the resurrection of the dead, whereof baptism is a type. For this cause the Lord, who is the Dispenser of our life, gave us the covenant of baptism, containing a type of life and death, for the water fulfils the image of death, and the Spirit gives us the earnest of life. Hence it follows that the answer to our question why the water was associated with the Spirit[fn-15-P1536_374781:310-nf] is clear: the reason is because in baptism two ends were proposed; on the one hand, the destroying of the body of sin,[fn-15-P1537_374927:311-nf] that it may never bear fruit unto death;[fn-15-P1538_374991:312-nf] on the other hand, our living unto the Spirit,[fn-15-P1539_375062:313-nf] and having our fruit in holiness;[fn-15-P1540_375119:314-nf] the water receiving the body as in a tomb figures death, while the Spirit pours in the quickening power, renewing our souls from the deadness of sin unto their original life. This then is what it is to be born again of water and of the Spirit, the being made dead being effected in the water, while our life is wrought in us through the Spirit. In three immersions,[fn-15-P1541_375509:315-nf] then, and with three invocations, the great mystery of baptism is performed, to the end that the type of death may be fully figured, and that by the tradition of the divine knowledge the baptized may have their souls enlightened. It follows that if there is any grace in the water, it is not of the nature of the water, but of the presence of the Spirit. For baptism is \"not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towards God.\"[fn-15-P1542_376000:316-nf] So in training us for the life that follows on the resurrection the Lord sets out all the manner of life required by the Gospel, laying down for us the law of gentleness, of endurance of wrong, of freedom from the defilement that comes of the love of pleasure, and from covetousness, to the end that we may of set purpose win beforehand and achieve all that the life to come of its inherent nature possesses. If therefore any one in attempting a definition were to describe the gospel as a forecast of the life that follows on the resurrection, he would not seem to me to go beyond what is meet and right.

But let us see if we can bethink us of any defence of this usage of our fathers; for they who first originated the expression are more open to blame than we ourselves.

Did then God give to a whole people and to the Church the boon of the life with Christ, and yet the life with Christ does not belong to the Holy Spirit? But if this is impious even to think of, is it not rightly reverent so to make our confession, as They are by nature in close conjunction? Furthermore what boundless lack of sensibility does it not shew in these men to confess that the Saints are with Christ,(if, as we know is the case, Paul, on becoming absent from the body, is present with the Lord,[fn-18-P1881_505000:580-nf] and, after departing, is with Christ[fn-18-P1882_505057:581-nf] ) and, so far as lies in their power, to refuse to allow to the Spirit to be with Christ even to the same extent as men? And Paul calls himself a \"labourer together with God\"[fn-18-P1883_505252:582-nf] in the dispensation of the Gospel; will they bring an indictment for impiety against us, if we apply the term \"fellow-labourer\" to the Holy Spirit, through whom in every creature under heaven the Gospel bringeth forth fruit?[fn-18-P1884_505501:583-nf] The life of them that have trusted in the Lord \"is hidden,\" it would seem, \"with Christ in God, and when Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall\" they themselves also \"appear with Him in glory;\"[fn-18-P1885_505730:584-nf] and is the Spirit of life Himself, \"Who made us free from the law of sin,\"[fn-18-P1886_505827:585-nf] not with Christ, both in the secret and hidden life with Him, and in the manifestation of the glory which we expect to be manifested in the saints?

No other thing, then, is chiefly to be regarded in this inquiry, which we make concerning the Trinity and concerning knowing God, except what is true love, nay, rather what is love. For that is to be called love which is true, otherwise it is desire; and so those who desire are said improperly to love, just as they who love are said improperly to desire. But this is true love, that cleaving to the truth we may live righteously, and so may despise all mortal things in comparison with the love of men, whereby we wish them to live righteously. For so we should be prepared also to die profitably for our brethren, as our Lord Jesus Christ taught us by His example. For as there are two commandments on which hang all the Law and the prophets, love of God and love of our neighbor;[fn-12-P1275_570944:16-nf] not without cause the Scripture mostly puts one for both: whether it be of God only, as is that text, \"For we know that all things work together for good to them that love God;\"[fn-12-P1276_571146:17-nf] and again, \"But if any man love God, the same is known of Him;[fn-12-P1277_571229:18-nf] and that, \"Because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us;\"[fn-12-P1278_571357:19-nf] and many other passages; because he who loves God must both needs do what God has commanded, and loves Him just in such proportion as he does so; therefore he must needs also love his neighbor, because God has commanded it: or whether it be that Scripture only mentions the love of our neighbor, as in that text, \"Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ;\"[fn-12-P1279_571753:20-nf] and again, \"For all the law is fufilled in one word, even in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself;\"[fn-12-P1280_571879:21-nf] and in the Gospel, \"All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the Law and the prophets.\"[fn-12-P1281_572036:22-nf] And many other passages occur in the sacred writings, in which only the love of our neighbor seems to be commanded for perfection, while the love of God is passed over in silence; whereas the Law and the prophets hang on both precepts. But this, too, is because be who loves his neighbor must needs also love above all else love itself. But \"God is love; and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God.\"[fn-12-P1282_572459:23-nf] Therefore he must needs above all else love God.","title":"Book VIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_10_book_v_","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"96","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"As we have touched the subject I deem it not unreasonable to say a few words concerning Easter. It appears to me that neither the ancients nor moderns who have affected to follow the Jews, have had any rational foundation for contending so obstinately about it. For they have not taken into consideration the fact that when Judaism was changed into Christianity, the obligation to observe the Mosaic law and the ceremonial types ceased. And the proof of the matter is plain; for no law of Christ permits Christians to imitate the Jews. On the contrary the apostle expressly forbids it; not only rejecting circumcision, but also deprecating contention about festival days. In his epistle to the Galatians[fn-16-P1697_730234:92-nf] he writes, `Tell me ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?' And continuing his train of argument, he demonstrates that the Jews were in bondage as servants, but that those who have come to Christ are `called into the liberty of sons.'[fn-16-P1698_730508:93-nf] Moreover he exhorts them in no way to regard `days, and months, and years.'[fn-16-P1699_730601:94-nf] Again in his epistle to the Colossians[fn-17-P1700_730658:95-nf] he distinctly declares, that such observances are merely shadows: wherefore he says, `Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of any holy-day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath-days; which are a shadow of things to come.' The same truths are also confirmed by him in the epistle to the Hebrews[fn-17-P1701_731004:96-nf] in these words: `For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.' Neither the apostles, therefore, nor the Gospels,[fn-17-P1702_731178:97-nf] have anywhere imposed the `yoke of servitude'[fn-17-P1703_731406:98-nf] on those who have embraced the truth; but have left Easter and every other feast to be honored by the gratitude of the recipients of grace. Wherefore, inasmuch as men love festivals, because they afford them cessation from labor: each individual in every place, according to his own pleasure, has by a prevalent custom celebrated the memory of the saving passion. The Saviour and his apostles have enjoined us by no law to keep this feast: nor do the Gospels and apostles threaten us with any penalty, punishment, or curse for the neglect of it, as the Mosaic law does the Jews. It is merely for the sake of historical accuracy, and for the reproach of the Jews, because they polluted themselves with blood on their very feasts, that it is recorded in the Gospels that our Saviour suffered in the days of `unleavened bread.'[fn-17-P1704_732247:99-nf] The aim of the apostles was not to appoint festival days, but to teach a righteous life and piety. And it seems to me that just as many other customs have been established in individual localities according to usage. So also the feast of Easter came to be observed in each place according to the individual peculiarities of the peoples inasmuch as none of the apostles legislated on the matter. And that the observance originated not by legislation, but as a custom the facts themselves indicate. In Asia Minor most people kept the fourteenth day of the moon, disregarding the sabbath: yet they never separated from those who did otherwise, until Victor, bishop of Rome, influenced by too ardent a zeal, fulminated a sentence of excommunication against the Quartodecimans[fn-17-P1705_733067:100-nf] in Asia. Wherefore also Irenaeus, bishop of Lyons in France, severely censured Victor by letter for his immoderate heat;[fn-17-P1706_733504:101-nf] telling him that although the ancients differed in their celebration of Easter, they did not desist from intercommunion. Also that Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna, who afterwards suffered martyrdom under Gordian,[fn-17-P1707_733746:102-nf] continued to communicate with Anicetus bishop of Rome, although he himself, according to the usage of his native Smyrna, kept Easter on the fourteenth day of the moon, as Eusebius attests in the fifth book of his Ecclesiastical History.[fn-17-P1708_734474:103-nf] While therefore some in Asia Minor observed the day above-mentioned, others in the East kept that feast on the sabbath indeed, but differed as regards the month. The former thought the Jews should be followed, though they were not exact: the latter kept Easter after the equinox, refusing to celebrate with the Jews; `for,' said they, `it ought to be celebrated when the sun is in Aries, in the month called Xanthicus by the Antiochians, and April by the Romans.' In this practice, they averred, they conformed not to the modern Jews, who are mistaken in almost everything, but to the ancients, and to Josephus according to what he has written in the third book of his Jewish Antiquities.[fn-17-P1709_735184:104-nf] Thus these people were at issue among themselves. But all other Christians in the Western parts, and as far as the ocean itself, are found to have celebrated Easter after the equinox, from a very ancient tradition. And in fact these acting in this manner have never disagreed on this subject. It is not true, as some have pretended, that the Synod under Constantine altered this festival:[fn-17-P1710_736069:105-nf] for Constantine himself, writing to those who differed respecting it, recommended that as they were few in number, they could agree with the majority of their brethren. His letter will be found at length in the third book of the Life of Constantine by Eusebius; but the passage in it relative to Easter runs thus:[fn-17-P1711_736472:106-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Socrates Scholasticus"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_17_vi_on_monogamy_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"21","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Heretics do away with marriages; Psychics accumulate them.

They who abuse thee, do thee equal hurt with them who use thee not. In fact, neither is such continence laudable because it is heretical, nor such licence defensible because it is psychical. The former is blasphemous, the latter wanton; the former destroys the God of marriages, the latter puts Him to the blush. Among us, however, whom the recognition of spiritual gifts entitles to be deservedly called Spiritual, continence is as religious as licence is modest; since both the one and the other are in harmony with the Creator.

We admit one marriage, just as we do one God. The law of marriage reaps an accession of honour where it is associated with shamefastness. But to the Psychics, since they receive not the Spirit, the things which are the Spirit's are not pleasing.

There is therefore a good agreement of this passage of the apostle with the words of the prophet so that belonging to the new testament means having the law of God not written on tables, but on the heart,- that is, embracing the righteousness of the law with innermost affection, where faith works by love.[fn-16-P1624_745913:227-nf] Because it isby faith that God justifies the Gentiles;\" and the Scripture foreseeing this, preached the gospel before to Abraham, saying, \"In thy seed shall all nations be blessed,\"[fn-16-P1625_746112:228-nf] in order that by this grace of promise the wild olive might be grafted into the good olive, and believing Gentiles might be made children of Abraham, \"in Abraham's seed, which is Christ,\"[fn-16-P1626_746335:229-nf] by following the faith of him who, without receiving the law written on tables, and not yet possessing even circumcision, \"believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.\"[fn-16-P1627_746539:230-nf] Now what the apostle attributed to Gentiles of this character,-how that \"they have the work of the law written in their hearts;\"[fn-16-P1628_746699:231-nf] must be some such thing as what he says to the Corinthians: \"not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.\"[fn-16-P1629_746840:232-nf] For thus do they become of the house of Israel, when their uncircumcision is accounted circumcision, by the fact that they do not exhibit the righteousness of the law by the excision of the flesh, but keep it by the charity of the heart. \"If,\" says he, \"the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?\"[fn-16-P1630_747230:233-nf] And therefore in the house of the true Israel, in which is no guile,[fn-16-P1631_747319:234-nf] they are partakers of the new testament, since God puts His laws into their mind, and writes them in their hearts with his own finger, the Holy Ghost, by whom is shed abroad in them the love[fn-16-P1632_747533:235-nf] which is the\" fulfilling of the law.\"[fn-16-P1633_747589:236-nf] ","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_14_on_the_spirit_and_the_letter","source_chapter":58,"source_paragraph":"183","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But there is yet another distinction to be observed,-since they who are under the law both attempt to work their own righteousness through fear of punishment, and fail to do God's righteousness, because this is accomplished by the love to which only what is lawful is pleasing, and never by the fear which is forced to have in its work the thing which is lawful, although it has something else in its will which would prefer, if it were only possible, that to be lawful which is not lawful. These persons also believe in God; for if they had no faith in Him at all, neither would they of course have any dread of the penalty of His law. This, however, is not the faith which the apostle commends. He says: \"Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.\"[fn-17-P1735_774857:308-nf] The fear, then, of which we speak is slavish; and therefore, even though there be in it a belief in the Lord, yet righteousness is not loved by it, but condemnation is feared. God's children, however, exclaim, \"Abba, Father,\"-one of which words they of the circumcision utter; the other, they of the uncircumcision,-the Jew first, and then the Greek;[fn-17-P1736_775230:309-nf] since there is \"one God, which justifieth the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.\"[fn-17-P1737_775357:310-nf] When indeed they utter this call, they seek something; and what do they seek, but that which they hunger and thirst after?

Perhaps, however, a man, in his folly, is unaware that no one can be continent except God give him the gift. To know this, indeed, he requires Wisdom herself.[fn-17-P1744_776878:317-nf] Why, then, does he not listen to the Spirit of his Father, speaking through Christ's apostle, or even Christ Himself, who says in His gospel, \"Seek and ye shall find; \"[fn-17-P1745_777070:318-nf] and who also says to us, speaking by His apostle: \"If any one of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given to him. Let him, however, ask in faith, nothing wavering? \"[fn-17-P1746_777329:319-nf] This is the faith by which the just man lives;[fn-17-P1747_777397:320-nf] this is the faith whereby he believes on Him who justifies the ungodly;[fn-17-P1748_777488:321-nf] this is the faith through which boasting is excluded,[fn-17-P1749_777561:322-nf] either by the retreat of that with which we become self-inflated, or by the rising of that with which we glory in the Lord. This, again, is the faith by which we procure that largess of the Spirit, of which it is said: \"We indeed through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.\"[fn-17-P1750_777877:323-nf] But this admits of the further question, Whether he meant by \"the hope of righteousness\" that by which righteousness hopes, or that whereby righteousness is itself hoped for? For the just man, who lives by faith, hopes undoubtedly for eternal life; and the faith likewise, which hungers and thirsts for righteousness, makes progress therein by the renewal of the inward man day by day,[fn-17-P1751_778281:324-nf] and hopes to be satiated therewith in that eternal life, where shall be realized that which is said of God by the psalm: \"Who satisfieth thy desire with good things.\"[fn-17-P1752_778470:325-nf] This, moreover, is the faith whereby they are saved to whom it is said: \"By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast.

These persons also believe in God; for if they had no faith in Him at all, neither would they of course have any dread of the penalty of His law. This, however, is not the faith which the apostle commends. He says: \"Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.\"[fn-17-P1735_774857:308-nf] The fear, then, of which we speak is slavish; and therefore, even though there be in it a belief in the Lord, yet righteousness is not loved by it, but condemnation is feared. God's children, however, exclaim, \"Abba, Father,\"-one of which words they of the circumcision utter; the other, they of the uncircumcision,-the Jew first, and then the Greek;[fn-17-P1736_775230:309-nf] since there is \"one God, which justifieth the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.\"[fn-17-P1737_775357:310-nf] When indeed they utter this call, they seek something; and what do they seek, but that which they hunger and thirst after? And what else is this but that which is said of them, \"Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled?\"[fn-17-P1738_775648:311-nf] Let, then, those who are under the law pass over hither, and become sons instead of slaves; and yet not so as to cease to be slaves, but so as, while they are sons, still to serve their Lord and Father freely. For even this have they received; for the Only-begotten \"gave them power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name;\"[fn-17-P1739_776017:312-nf] and He advised them to ask, to seek, and to knock, in order to receive, to find, and to have the gate opened to them,[fn-17-P1740_776154:313-nf] adding by way of rebuke, the words : \"If ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him?\"[fn-17-P1741_776373:314-nf] When, therefore, that strength of sin, the law,[fn-17-P1742_776443:315-nf] inflamed the sting of death, even sin, to take occasion and by the commandment work all manner of concupiscence in them,[fn-17-P1743_776586:316-nf] of whom were they to ask for the gift of continence but of Him who knows how to give good gifts to His children? Perhaps, however, a man, in his folly, is unaware that no one can be continent except God give him the gift. To know this, indeed, he requires Wisdom herself.[fn-17-P1744_776878:317-nf] Why, then, does he not listen to the Spirit of his Father, speaking through Christ's apostle, or even Christ Himself, who says in His gospel, \"Seek and ye shall find; \"[fn-17-P1745_777070:318-nf] and who also says to us, speaking by His apostle: \"If any one of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given to him. Let him, however, ask in faith, nothing wavering? \"[fn-17-P1746_777329:319-nf] This is the faith by which the just man lives;[fn-17-P1747_777397:320-nf] this is the faith whereby he believes on Him who justifies the ungodly;[fn-17-P1748_777488:321-nf] this is the faith through which boasting is excluded,[fn-17-P1749_777561:322-nf] either by the retreat of that with which we become self-inflated, or by the rising of that with which we glory in the Lord. This, again, is the faith by which we procure that largess of the Spirit, of which it is said: \"We indeed through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.\"[fn-17-P1750_777877:323-nf] But this admits of the further question, Whether he meant by \"the hope of righteousness\" that by which righteousness hopes, or that whereby righteousness is itself hoped for? For the just man, who lives by faith, hopes undoubtedly for eternal life; and the faith likewise, which hungers and thirsts for righteousness, makes progress therein by the renewal of the inward man day by day,[fn-17-P1751_778281:324-nf] and hopes to be satiated therewith in that eternal life, where shall be realized that which is said of God by the psalm: \"Who satisfieth thy desire with good things.\"[fn-17-P1752_778470:325-nf] This, moreover, is the faith whereby they are saved to whom it is said: \"By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.\"[fn-17-P1753_778822:326-nf] This, in short, is the faith which works not by fear, but by love;[fn-17-P1754_778910:327-nf] not by dreading punishment, but by loving righteousness. Whence, therefore, arises this love,-that is to say, this charity,-by which faith works, if not from the source whence faith itself obtained it?

He crowns, therefore, with loving-kindness and tender mercy; but even so according to works. For he shall be separated to the right hand, to whom, it is said, \"I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat.\"[fn-17-P1783_787204:347-nf] There will, however, be also \"judgment without mercy;\" but it will be for him\" that hath not showed mercy.\"[fn-17-P1784_787334:348-nf] But \"blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy\"[fn-17-P1785_787414:349-nf] of God.

And yet it was through me that custom became more combative against me, because I had come willingly whither I willed not. And who, then, can with any justice speak against it, when just punishment follows the sinner?[fn-12-P1224_507939:60-nf] Nor had I now any longer my wonted excuse, that as yet I hesitated to be above the world and serve Thee, because my perception of the truth was uncertain; for now it was certain.

In the above discussion the Apostle has taught that the believer ought not to depart from the unbeliever, but remain in marriage as the faith found them, and that each man whether married or single should continue as he was when baptized into Christ; and then he suddenly introduces the metaphors of circumcision and uncircumcision, of bond and free, and under those metaphors treats of the married and unmarried.[fn-62-P6202_1874009:58-nf] \"Was any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing: but the keeping of the commandments of God. Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called. Wast thou called being a bondservant? Care not for it: but even if thou canst become free, use it rather. For he that was called in the Lord being a bondservant, is the Lord's freedman; likewise he that was called, being free, is Christ's bondservant. Ye were bought with a price; become not bondservants of men. Brethren, let each man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God.\" Some, I suppose, will find fault with the Apostle's way of reasoning. I would therefore ask first, What we are to infer from his suddenly passing in a discussion concerning husbands and wives to a comparison of Jew and Gentile, bond and free, and then returning, when this point is settled, to the question about virgins, and telling us \"Concerning virgins I have no commandment from the Lord\"; what has a comparison of Jew and Gentile, bond and free, to do with wedlock and virginity? In the next place, how are we to understand the words \"Hath any been called in uncircumcision, let him not be circumcised\"?[fn-62-P6203_1875260:59-nf] Can a man who has lost his foreskin restore it again at his pleasure? Then, in what sense are we to explain \"For he that was called in the Lord, being a bondservant, is the Lord's freedman: likewise he that was called, being free, is Christ's bondservant.\" Fourthly, how is it that he who commanded servants to obey their masters according to the flesh, now says, \"Become net bondservants of men.\" Lastly, how are we to connect with slavery, or with circumcision, his saying \"Brethren, let each man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God,\" which even contradicts his previous opinion. We heard him say \"Become not bondservants of men.\" How can we then possibly abide in that vocation wherein we were called, when many at the time they became believers had masters according to the flesh, whose bondservants they are now forbidden to be? Moreover, what has the argument about our abiding in the vocation wherein we were called, to do with circumcision? for in another place the same Apostle cries aloud \"Behold I Paul tell you that, if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing\"? We must conclude, therefore, that a higher meaning should be given to circumcision and uncircumcision, bond and free, and that these words must be taken in close connection with what has gone before. \"Was anyone called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised.\" If, he says, at the time you were called and became a believer in Christ, if I say, you were called being circumcised from a wife, that is, unmarried, do not marry a wife, that is, do not become uncircumcised, lest you lay upon the freedom of circumcision and chastity the burden of marriage. Again, if anyone was called in uncircumcision, let him not be circumcised. You had a wife, he says, when you believed: do not think the faith of Christ a reason for disagreement, because God called us in peace.[fn-62-P6204_1877420:60-nf] \"Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God.\" For neither celibacy nor marriage availeth anything without works, since even faith, which is specially characteristic of Christians, if it have not works, is said to be dead, and vestal virgins and Juno's widows might upon these terms be numbered with the saints. \"Let each man in the vocation wherein he was called, therein abide.\" Whether he had, or had not, a wife when he believed, let him remain in that condition in which he was when called. Accordingly he does not so strongly urge virgins to be married, as forbid divorce. And as he debars those who have wives from putting them away, so he cuts off from virgins the power of being married. \"Thou wast called being a slave, heed it not; but even if thou canst become free, use it rather.\" Even if you have, he says, a wife, and are bound to her, and pay her due, and have not power over your own body; or if, to speak more clearly, you are the bondservant of your wife, be not sad upon that account, nor sigh for the loss of your virginity. But even if you can find some causes of discord, do not, for the sake of thoroughly enjoying the liberty of chastity, seek your own welfare by destroying another. Keep your wife awhile, and do not go too fast for her lagging footsteps: wait till she follows. If you are patient, your spouse will become a sister, \"For he that was called in the Lord, being a bondservant, is the Lord's freedman: likewise, he that was called being free, is Christ's bondservant.\" He gives his reasons for not wishing wives to be forsaken. He therefore says, I command that Gentiles who believe on Christ do not abandon the married state in which they were before embracing the faith: for he who had a wife when he became a believer, is not so strictly devoted to the service of God as virgins and unmarried persons. But, in a manner, he has more freedom, and the reins of his bondage are relaxed; and, while he is the bondservant of a wife, he is, so to speak, the freedman of the Lord. Moreover, he who when called by the Lord had not a wife and was free from the bondage of wedlock, he is truly Christ's bondservant. What happiness to be the bondservant, not of a wife but of Christ, to serve not the flesh, but the spirit![fn-62-P6205_1879747:61-nf] \"For he who is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.\" There was some fear that by saying \"Wast thou called being a bondservant? Care not for it: but, even if thou canst become free, use it rather,\" he might seem to have flouted continence, and to have given us up to the slavery of marriage. He therefore makes a remark which removes all cavil: \"Ye were bought with a price, become not servants of men.\" We have been redeemed with the most precious blood of Christ: the Lamb was slain for us, and having been sprinkled with hyssop and the warm drops of His blood, we have rejected poisonous pleasure. Why do we at whose baptism Pharaoh died and all his host was drowned, again turn back in our hearts to Egypt, and after the manna, angels' food, sigh for the garlic and the onions and the cucumbers, and Pharaoh's meat?

In short, let them teach us, as we have already premised, that Adam observed the sabbath; or that Abel, when offering to God a holy victim, pleased Him by a religious reverence for the sabbath; or that Enoch, when translated, had been a keeper of the sabbath; or that Noah the ark-builder observed, on account of the deluge, an immense sabbath; or that Abraham, in observance of the sabbath, offered Isaac his son; or that Melchizedek in his priesthood received the law of the sabbath.","title":"An Answer to the Jews.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_19_an_answer_to_the_jews_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"110","folder":"ANF-03","text":"And, of course, it had been meet that the mystery[fn-23-P2327_767689:198-nf] of the passion itself should be figuratively set forth in predictions; and the more incredible (that mystery), the more likely to be \"a stumbling-stone,\"[fn-23-P2328_767863:199-nf] if it had been nakedly predicted; and the more magnificent, the more to be adumbrated, that the difficulty of its intelligence might seek (help from) the grace of God.","title":"An Answer to the Jews.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_19_an_answer_to_the_jews_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"110","folder":"ANF-03","text":"And, of course, it had been meet that the mystery[fn-23-P2327_767689:198-nf] of the passion itself should be figuratively set forth in predictions; and the more incredible (that mystery), the more likely to be \"a stumbling-stone,\"[fn-23-P2328_767863:199-nf] if it had been nakedly predicted; and the more magnificent, the more to be adumbrated, that the difficulty of its intelligence might seek (help from) the grace of God.","title":"An Answer to the Jews.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_19_an_answer_to_the_jews_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"110","folder":"ANF-03","text":"And, of course, it had been meet that the mystery[fn-23-P2327_767689:198-nf] of the passion itself should be figuratively set forth in predictions; and the more incredible (that mystery), the more likely to be \"a stumbling-stone,\"[fn-23-P2328_767863:199-nf] if it had been nakedly predicted; and the more magnificent, the more to be adumbrated, that the difficulty of its intelligence might seek (help from) the grace of God.","title":"An Answer to the Jews.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":12,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_19_vii_on_modesty_","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"ANF-04","text":"This too, therefore, shall be a count in my indictment against the Psychics; against the fellowship of sentiment also which I myself formerly maintained with them; in order that they may the more cast this in my teeth for a mark of fickleness. Repudiation of fellowship is never a pre-indication of sin. As if it were not easier to err with the majority, when it is in the company of the few that truth is loved But, however, a profitable fickleness shall no more be a disgrace to me, than I should wish a hurtful one to be an ornament. I blush not at an error which I have ceased to hold, because I am delighted at having ceased to hold it, because I recognise myself to be better and more modest. No one blushes at his own improvement. Even in Christ, knowledge had its stages of growth;[fn-12-P1294_354442:10-nf] through which stages the apostle, too, passed. \"When I was a child,\" he says, \"as a child I spake, as a child I understood; but when I became a man, those (things) which had been the child's I abandoned: \"[fn-12-P1295_354670:11-nf] so truly did he turn away from his early opinions: nor did he sin by becoming an emulator not of ancestral but of Christian traditions,[fn-12-P1296_354848:12-nf] wishing even the precision of them who advised the retention of circumcision.[fn-12-P1297_354970:13-nf] And would that the same fate might befall those, too, who obtruncate the pure and true integrity of the flesh; amputating not the extremest superficies, but the inmost image of modesty itself, while they promise pardon to adulterers and fornicators, in the teeth of the primary discipline of the Christian Name; a discipline to which heathendom itself bears such emphatic witness, that it strives to punish that discipline in the persons of our females rather by defilements of the flesh than tortures; wishing to wrest from them that which they hold dearer than life! But now this glory is being extinguished, and that by means of those who ought with all the more constancy to refuse concession of any pardon to defilements of this kind, that they make the fear of succumbing to adultery and fornication their reason for marrying as often as they please-since \"better it is to marry than to burn.\"[fn-12-P1298_355891:14-nf] No doubt it is for continence sake that incontinence is necessary-the \"burning\" will be extinguished by \"fires!\" Why, then, do they withal grant indulgence, under the name of repentance, to crimes for which they furnish remedies by their law of multinuptialism? For remedies will be idle while crimes are indulged, and crimes will remain if remedies are idle. And so, either way, they trifle with solicitude and negligence; by taking emptiest precaution against (crimes) to which they grant quarter, and granting absurdest quarter to (crimes) against which they take precaution: whereas either precaution is not to be taken where quarter is given, or quarter not given where precaution is taken; for they take precaution, as if they were unwilling that something should be committed; but grant indulgence, as if they were willing it should be committed: whereas, if they be unwilling it should be committed, they ought not to grant indulgence; if they be willing to grant indulgence, they ought not to take precaution. For, again, adultery and fornication will not be ranked at the same time among the moderate and among the greatest sins, so that each course may be equally open with regard to them-the solicitude which takes precaution, and the security which grants indulgence. But since they are such as to hold the culminating place among crimes, there is no room at once for their indulgence as if they were moderate, and for their precaution as if they were greatest But by us precaution is thus also taken against the greatest, or, (if you will), highest (crimes, viz.,) in that it is not permitted, after believing, to know even a second marriage, differentiated though it be, to be sure, from the work of adultery and fornication by the nuptial and dotal tablets: and accordingly, with the utmost strictness, we excommunicate digamists, as bringing infamy upon the Paraclete by the irregularity of their discipline. The self-same liminal limit we fix for adulterers also and fornicators; dooming them to pour forth tears barren of peace, and to regain from the Church no ampler return than the publication of their disgrace.","title":"VII.

Let none seduce you with empty words: on this account cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of unbelief.\"[fn-15-P1554_455500:208-nf] Who \"seduces with empty words\" but he who states in a public harangue that adultery is remissible? not seeing into the fact that its very foundations have been dug out by the apostle, when he puts restraints upon drunkennesses and revellings, as withal here: \"And be not inebriated with wine, in which is voluptuousness.\"[fn-15-P1555_455857:209-nf] He demonstrates, too, to the Colossians what \"members\" they are to\"mortify\" upon earth: \"fornication, impurity, lust, evil concupiscence,\" and \"base talk.\"[fn-15-P1556_456029:210-nf] Yield up, by this time, to so many and such sentences, the one (passage) to which you cling. Paucity is cast into the shade by multitude, doubt by certainty, obscurity by plainness. Even if, for certain, the apostle had granted pardon of fornication to that Corinthian, it would be another instance of his once for all contravening his own practice to meet the requirement of the time.

And to the Corinthians he writes:[fn-66-P6617_2071797:27-nf] \"I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is toward Christ.\" And elsewhere:[fn-66-P6618_2071981:28-nf] \"But to whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also: for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes have I forgiven it in the person of Christ: that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices.\" And again:[fn-66-P6619_2072287:29-nf] \"There hath no temptation taken you, but such as man can bear; but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make also the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it.\" And,[fn-66-P6620_2072550:30-nf] \"Let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.\" And to the Galatians:[fn-66-P6621_2072652:31-nf] \"Ye were running well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?\" And elsewhere:[fn-66-P6622_2072761:32-nf] \"We would fain have come unto you, I Paul once and again; and Satan hindered us.\" And to the married he says:[fn-66-P6623_2072893:33-nf] \"Be together again, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency.\" And again:[fn-66-P6624_2073000:34-nf] \"But I say, walk by the Spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other: that ye may not do the things that ye would.\" We are a compound of the two, and must endure the strife of the two substances. And to the Ephesians:[fn-66-P6625_2073376:35-nf] \"Our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.\" Does any one think that we are safe, and that it is right to fall asleep when once we have been baptized? And so, too, in the epistle to the Hebrews:[fn-66-P6626_2073753:36-nf] \"For as touching those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come, and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.\" Surely we cannot deny that they have been baptized who have been illuminated, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God. Butif the baptized cannot sin, how is it now that the Apostle says, \"And have fallen away\"?[fn-66-P6627_2074420:37-nf] Montanus and[fn-66-P6628_2075404:38-nf] Novatus would smile at this, for they contend that it is impossible to renew again through repentance those who have crucified to themselves the Son of God, and put Him to an open shame. He therefore corrects this mistake by saying:[fn-66-P6629_2076011:39-nf] \"But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak; for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and the love which ye shewed towards his name, in that ye ministered unto the Saints, and still do minister.\" And truly the unrighteousness of God would be great, if He merely punished sin, and did not welcome good works. I have so spoken, says the Apostle, to withdraw you from your sins, and to make you more careful through fear of despair. But, beloved, I am persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation. For it is not accordant with the righteousness of God to forget good works, and the fact that you have ministered and do minister to the Saints for His name's sake, and to remember sins only. The Apostle James also, knowing that the baptized can be tempted, and fall of their own free choice, says:[fn-66-P6630_2076919:40-nf] \"Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he hath been approved, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to them that love him.\" And that we may not think that we are tempted by God, as we read in Genesis Abraham was, he adds: \"Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, and He Himself tempteth no man. But each man is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lust and enticed. Then the lust, when it hath conceived, beareth sin: and the sin, when it is full grown, bringeth forth death.\" God created us with free will, and we are not forced by necessity either to virtue or to vice. Otherwise, if there be necessity, there is no crown. As n good works it is God who brings them to perfection, for it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that pitieth and gives us help that we may be able to reach the goal: so in things wicked and sinful, the seeds within us give the impulse, and these are brought to maturity by the devil. When he sees that we are building upon the foundation of Christ, hay, wood, stubble, then he applies the match. Let us then build gold, silver, costly stones, and he will not venture to tempt us: although even thus there is not sure and safe possession. For the lion lurks in ambush to slay the innocent.[fn-66-P6631_2078282:41-nf] \"Potters' vessels are proved by the furnace, and just men by the trial of tribulation.\" And in another place it is written:[fn-66-P6632_2078429:42-nf] \"My son, when thou comest to serve the Lord, prepare thyself for temptation.\" Again, the same James says:[fn-66-P6633_2078555:43-nf] \"Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only. For if any one is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror: for he beholdeth himself, and goeth away, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.\" It was useless to warn them to add works to faith, if they could not sin after baptism. He tells us that[fn-66-P6634_2078944:44-nf] \"whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is become guilty of all.\" Which of us is without sin?[fn-66-P6635_2079087:45-nf] \"God hath shut up all unto disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.\" Peter also says:[fn-66-P6636_2079199:46-nf] \"The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation.\" And concerning false teachers:[fn-66-P6637_2079310:47-nf] \"These are springs without water, and mists driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved. For, uttering proud wordsof vanity, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by lasciviousness, those who had just escaped, and have turned back to error.\" Does not the Apostle in these words seem to you to have depicted the new party of ignorance? For, as it were, they open the fountains of knowledge and yet have no water: they promise a shower of doctrine like prophetic clouds which have been visited by the truth of God, and are driven by the storms of devils and vices. They speak great things, and their talk is nothing but pride:[fn-66-P6638_2080000:48-nf] \"But every one is unclean with God who is lifted up in his own heart.\" Like those who had just escaped from their sins, they return to their own error, and persuade men to luxury, and to the delights of eating and the gratification of the flesh. For who is not glad to hear them say: \"Let us eat and drink, and reign for ever\"? The wise and prudent they call corrupt, but pay more attention to the honey-tongued. John the apostle, or rather the Saviour in the person of John, writes thus to the angel of the Church of Ephesus:[fn-66-P6639_2080552:49-nf] \"I know thy works and thy toil and patience, and that thou didst bear for my name's sake, and hast not grown weary. But I have this against thee, that thou didst leave thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come to thee, and will move thy candlestick out of its place, except thou repent.\" Similarly He urges the other churches, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, Laodicea, to repentance, and threatens them unless they return to the former works. And in Sardis He says He has a few who have not defiled their garments, and they shall walk with Him in white, for they are worthy. But they to whom He says: \"Remember from whence thou art fallen \"; and, \"Behold the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried\"; and, \"I know where thou dwellest, even where Satan's throne is\"; and, \"Remember how thou hast received, and didst hear, and keep it, and repent,\" and so on, were of course believers, and baptized, who once stood, but fell through sin.","title":"Book II.","author":false},{"chapter":5,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_16_on_nature_and_grace_against_pelagius","source_chapter":49,"source_paragraph":"182","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Perhaps, however, he thinks the name of Christ to be necessary on this account, that by His gospel we may learn how we ought to live; but not that we may be also assisted by His grace, in order withal to lead good lives.

Let him tell us how; for even in these there is that nature which has been so stoutly defended by him. However, in these he does certainly allow that nature is corrupted, inasmuch as it was only among the baptized that the wounded traveller left his inn sound and well, or rather remains sound in the inn whither the compassionate Samaritan carried him that he might become cured.[fn-22-P2219_923310:149-nf] Well, now, if heallows that the flesh is contrary even in these,let him tell us what has happened to occasion this, since the flesh and the spirit alike are the work of one and the same Creator, and are therefore undoubtedly both of them good, because He is good, - unless indeed it be that damage which has been inflicted by man's own will. And that this may be repaired in our nature, there is need of that very Saviour from whose creative hand nature itself proceeded. Now, if we acknowledge that this Saviour, and that healing remedy of His by which the Word was made flesh in order to dwell among us, are required by small and great, - by the crying infant and the hoary-headed man alike, - then, in fact, thewhole controversy of the point between us is settled.","title":"On Nature and Grace, Against Pelagius","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_16_on_nature_and_grace_against_pelagius","source_chapter":63,"source_paragraph":"210","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Now let us see whether we anywhere readabout the flesh being contrary in the baptized also.

For it is in his very will that he is guilty, whereby he would prefer, if it were possible, that what he dreads should not exist, in order that be might freely do what he secretly desires.

Besides these Apollinarius of Laodicea constituted himself leader of a third party, and though he assumed a mask of piety, and appeared to defend apostolic doctrines, he was soon seen to be an open foe. About the divine nature he used unsound arguments, and originated the idea of certain degrees of dignities. He also had the hardihood to render the mystery of the incarnation[fn-22-P2243_714749:3-nf] imperfect and affirmed that the reasonable soul, which is entrusted with the guidance of the body, was deprived of the salvation effected. For according to his argument God the Word did not assume this soul, and so neither granted it His healing gift, nor gave it a portion of His dignity. Thus the earthly body is represented as worshipped by invisible powers, while the soul which is made in the image of God has remained below invested with the dishonour of sin.[fn-22-P2244_715269:4-nf] Many more errors did he utter in his stumbling and blinded intelligence. At one time even he was ready to confess that of the Holy Virgin the flesh had been taken, at another time he represented it to have come down from heaven with God the Word, and yet again that He had been made flesh and took nothing from us. Other vain tales and trifles which I have thought it superfluous to repeat he mixed up with God's gospel promises. By arguments of this nature he not only filled his own friends with dangerous doctrine but even imparted it to some among ourselves. As time went on, when they saw their own insignificance, and beheld the splendour of the Church, all except a few were gathered into the Church's communion. But they did not quite put away their former unsoundness, and with it infected many of the sound. This was the origin of the growth in the Church of the doctrine of the one nature of the Flesh and of the Godhead, of the ascription to the Godhead of the Passion of the only begotten, and of other points which have bred differences among the laity and their priests. But these belong to a later date. At the time of which I am speaking, when Sapor the General had arrived and had exhibited the imperial edict, Paulinus affirmed that he sided with Damasus, and Apollinarius, concealing his unsoundness, did the same. The divine Meletius, on the other hand, made no sign, and put up with their dispute. Flavianus, of high fame for his wisdom, who was at that time still in the ranks of the presbyterate, at first said to Paulinus in the hearing of the officer \"If, my dear friend, you accept communion with Damasus, point out to us clearly how the doctrines agree, for he though he owns one substance of the Trinity openly preaches three essences.[fn-22-P2245_717441:5-nf] You on the contrary deny the Trinity of the essences. Shew us then how these doctrines are in harmony, and receive the charge of the churches, as the edict enjoins.\" After so silencing Paulinus by his arguments he turned to Apollinarius and said, \"I am astonished, my friend, to find you waging such violent war against the truth, when all the while you know quite clearly how the admirable Damasus maintains oar nature to have been taken in its perfection by God the Word; but you persist in saying the contrary, for you deprive our intelligence of its salvation.

Lastly, it is a thing that can both be feigned by pretence, and be thought to be in him in whom it is not. Therefore every one sees his own faith in himself; but does not see, hut believes, that it is in another; and believes this the more firmly, the more he knows the fruits of it, which faith is wont to work by love.[fn-16-P1620_799427:4-nf] And therefore this faith is common to all of whom the evangelist subjoins, \"But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name: which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God;\" common I say, not as any form of a bodily object is common, as regards sight, to the eyes of all to whom it is present, for in some way the gaze of all that behold it is informed by the same one form; but as the human countenance can be said to be common to all men; for this is so said that yet each certainly has his own. We say certainly with perfect truth, that the faith of believers is impressed from one doctrine upon the heart of each several person who believes the same thing. But that which is believed is a different thing from the faith by which it is believed. For the former is in things which are said either to be, or to have been or to be about to be; but the latter is in the mind of the believer, and is visible to him only whose it is; although not indeed itself but a faith like it, is also in others. For it is not one in number, but in kind; yet on account of the likeness, and the absence of all difference, we rather call it one than many. For when, too, we see two men exceedingly alike, we wonder, and say that both have one countenance. It is therefore more easily said that the souls were many,-a several soul, of course, for each several person-of whom we read in the Acts of the Apostles, that they were of one soul,[fn-16-P1621_800982:5-nf] -than it is, where the apostle speaks of \"one faith,\"[fn-16-P1622_801053:6-nf] for any one to venture to say that there are as many faiths as there are faithful. And yet He who says, \"O woman, great is thy faith;\"[fn-16-P1623_801203:7-nf] and to another, \"O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?[fn-16-P1624_801289:8-nf] intimates that each has his own faith. But the like faith of believers is said to be one, in the same way as a like will of those who will is said to be one; since in the case also of those who have the same will, the will of each is visible to himself, but that of the other is not visible, although he wills the same thing; and if it intimate itself by any signs, it is believed rather! than seen.

For then He promised that He Himself would send Him, and He sent Him;[fn-16-P1660_828358:17-nf] because then, as it was written and foretold of Him, \"He ascended up on high, He led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.\"[fn-16-P1661_828527:18-nf] These gifts constitute our deserts, by which we arrive at the chief good of an immortal blessedness. \"But God,\" says the apostle, \"commendeth His love towards as, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more, then, being now justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.\" To this he goes on to add, \"For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son; much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.\" Those whom he first calls sinners he afterwards calls the enemies of God; and those whom he first speaks of as justified by His blood, he afterwards speaks of as reconciled by the death of the Son of God; and those whom he speaks of first as saved from wrath through Him, he afterwards speaks of as saved by His life. We were not, therefore, before that grace merely anyhow sinners, but in such sins that we were enemies of God.

And this word the Latin language had not previously, but could have seeing that it could have it when it wanted it.

For we wished to ascend, as it were, by steps, and to seek in the inner man, both in knowledge and in wisdom, a sort of trinity of its own special kind, such as we sought before in the outer man; in order that we may come, with a mind more practised in these lower things, to the contemplation of that Trinity which is God, according to our little measure, if indeed, we can even do this, at least in a riddle and as through a glass.[fn-17-P1734_866694:59-nf] If, then, any one have committed to memory the words of this faith in their sounds alone, not knowing what they mean, as they commonly who do not know Greek hold in memory Greek words, or similarly Latin ones, or thoseof any other language of which they are ignorant, has not he a sort of trinity in his mind? because, first, those sounds of words are in his memory, even when he does not think thereupon; and next, the mental vision (acies) of his act of recollection is formed thence when he conceives of them; and next, the will of him who remembers and thinks unites both. Yet we should by no means say that the man in so doing busies himself with a trinity of the interior man, but rather of the exterior; because he remembers, and when he wills, contemplates as much as he wills, that alone which belongs to the sense of the body, which is called hearing. Nor in such an act of thought does he do anything else than deal with images of corporeal things, that is, of sounds. But if he holds and recollects what those words signify, now indeed something of the inner man is brought into action; not yet, however, ought he to be said or thought to live according to a trinity of the tuner man, if he does not love those things which are there declared, enjoined, promised. For it is possible for him also to hold and conceive these things, supposing them to be false, in order that he may endeavor to disprove them. Therefore that will, which in this case unites those things which are held in the memory with those things which are thence impressed on the mind's eye in conception, completes, indeed, some kind of trinity, since itself is a third added to two others; but the man does not live according to this, when those things which are conceived are taken to be false, and are not accepted. But when those things are believed to be true, and those things which therein ought to be loved, are loved, then at last the man does live according to a trinity of the inner man; for every one lives according to that which he loves. But how can things be loved which are not known, but only believed? This question has been already treated of in former books;[fn-17-P1735_868877:60-nf] and we found, that no one loves what he is wholly ignorant of, but that when things not known are said to be loved, they are loved from those things which are known. And now we so conclude this book, that we admonish the just to live by faith,[fn-17-P1736_869171:61-nf] which faith worketh by love,[fn-17-P1737_869218:62-nf] so that the virtues also themselves, by which one lives prudently, boldly, temperately, and justly, be all referred to the same faith; for not otherwise can they be true virtues. And yet these in this life are not of so great worth, as that the remission of sins, of some kind or other, is not sometimes necessary here; and this remission comes not to pass, except through Him, who by His own blood conquered the prince of sinners.

To this definition we take no exception, except that we would not ascribe this twofold distinction to the nature (of the soul). It is the rational element which we must believe to be its natural condition, impressed upon it from its very first creation by its Author, who is Himself essentially rational. For how should that be other than rational, which God produced on His own prompting; nay more, which He expressly sent forth by His own afflatus or breath? The irrational element, however, we must understand to have accrued later, as having proceeded from the instigation of the serpent-the very achievement of (the first) transgression-which thenceforward became inherent in the soul, and grew with its growth, assuming the manner by this time of a natural development, happening as it did immediately at the beginning of nature. But, inasmuch as the same Plato speaks of the rational element only as existing in the soul of God Himself, if we were to ascribe the irrational element likewise to the nature which our soul has received from God, then the irrational element will be equally derived from God, as being a natural production, because God is the author of nature. Now from the devil proceeds the incentive to sin. All sin, however, is irrational: therefore the irrational proceeds from the devil, from whom sin proceeds; and it is extraneous to God, to whom also the irrationalis an alien principle. The diversity, then, between these two elements arises from the difference of their authors. When, therefore, Plato reserves the rational element (of the soul) to God alone, and subdivides it into two departments the irascible, which they call qumiko/n, and the concupiscible, which they designate by the term e0piqumhtiko/n (in such a way as to make the first common to us and lions, and the second shared between ourselves and flies, whilst the rational element is confined to us and God)-I see that this point will have to be treated by us, owing to the facts which we find operating also in Christ. For you may behold this triad of qualities in the Lord. There was the rational element, by which He taught, by which He discoursed, by which He prepared the way of salvation; there was moreover indignation in Him, by which He inveighed against the scribes and the Pharisees; and there was the principle of desire, by which He so earnestly desired to eat the pass over with His disciples.[fn-27-P2727_912997:111-nf] In our own cases, accordingly, the irascible and the concupiscible elements of our soul must not invariably be put to the account of the irrational (nature), since we are sure that in our Lord these elements operated in entire accordance with reason. God will be angry, with perfect reason, with all who deserve His wrath; and with reason, too, will God desire whatever objects and claims are worthy of Himself. For He will show indignation against the evil man, and for the good man will He desire salvation. To ourselves even does the apostle allow the concupiscible quality. \"If any man,\" says he, \"desireth the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.\"[fn-27-P2728_913680:112-nf] Now, by saying \"a good work,\" he shows us that the desire is a reasonable one. He permits us likewise to feel indignation. How should he not, when he himself experiences the same? \"I would,\" says he, \"that they were even cut off which trouble you.\"[fn-27-P2729_913951:113-nf] In perfect agreement with reason was that indignation which resulted from his desire to maintain discipline and order. When, however, he says, \"We were formerly the children of wrath,\"[fn-27-P2730_914155:114-nf] he censures an irrational irascibility, such as proceeds not from that nature which is the production of God, but from that which the devil brought in, who is himself styled the lord or \"master\" of his own class, \"Ye cannot serve two masters,\"[fn-27-P2731_914418:115-nf] and has the actual designation of \"father: \"\"Ye are of your father the devil.\"[fn-27-P2732_914518:116-nf] So that you need not be afraid to ascribe to him the mastery and dominion over that second, later, and deteriorated nature (of which we have been speaking), when you read of him as \"the sewer of tares, and the nocturnal spoiler of the crop of corn.[fn-27-P2733_914787:117-nf] ","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":16,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_22_a_treatise_on_the_soul_","source_chapter":42,"source_paragraph":"147","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Every soul, then, by reason of its birth, has its nature in Adam until it is born again in Christ; moreover, it is unclean all the while that it remains without this regeneration;[fn-29-P2954_1042480:266-nf] and because unclean, it is actively sinful, and suffuses even the flesh (by reason of their conjunction) with its own shame. Now although the flesh is sinful, and we are forbidden to walk in accordance with it,[fn-29-P2955_1042710:267-nf] and its works are condemned as lusting against the spirit,[fn-29-P2956_1042788:268-nf] and men on its account are censured as carnal,[fn-29-P2957_1042851:269-nf] yet the flesh has not such ignominy on its own account. For it is not of itself that it thinks anything or feels anything for the purpose of advising or commanding sin. How should it, indeed? It is only a ministering thing, and its ministration is not like that of a servant or familiar friend-animated and human beings; but rather that of a vessel, or something of that kind: it is body, not soul. Now a cup may minister to a thirsty man; and yet, if the thirsty man will not apply the cup to his mouth, the cup will yield no ministering service. Therefore the differentia, or distinguishing property, of man by no means lies in his earthy element; nor is the flesh the human person, as being some faculty of his soul, and a personal quality; but it is a thing of quite a different substance and different condition, although annexed to the soul as a chattel or as an instrument for the offices of life. Accordingly the flesh is blamed in the Scriptures, because nothing is done by the soul without the flesh in operations of concupiscence, appetite, drunkenness, cruelty, idolatry, and other works of the flesh,-operations, I mean, which are not confined to sensations, but result in effects. The emotions of sin, indeed, when not resulting in effects, are usually imputed to the soul: \"Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after, hath already in his heart committed adultery with her.\"[fn-29-P2958_1044261:270-nf] But what has the flesh alone, without the soul, ever done in operations of virtue, righteousness, endurance, or chastity? What absurdity, however, it is to attribute sin and crime to that substance to which you do not assign any good actions or character of its own! Now the party which aids in the commission of a crime is brought to trial, only in such a way that the principal offender who actually committed the crime may bear the weight of the penalty, although the abettor too does not escape indictment. Greater is the odium which falls on the principal, when his officials are punished through his fault. He is beaten with more stripes who instigates and orders the crime, whilst at the same time he who obeys such an evil command is not acquitted.","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_14_book_iii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Let us then begin our examination from the context of the passage in question, and see whether the reading of the neighbouring clauses gives any clear sense. The discourse describes Wisdom as uttering certain sayings in her own person. Every student knows what is said in the passage[fn-13-P1337_720846:22-nf] where Wisdom makes counsel her dwelling-place, and calls to her knowledge and understanding, and says that she has as a possession strength and prudence (while she is herself called intelligence), and that she walks in the ways of righteousness and has her conversation in the ways of just judgement, and declares that by her kings reign, and princes write the decree of equity, and monarchs win possession of their own land. Now every one will see that the considerate reader will receive none of the phrases quoted without scrutiny according to the obvious sense. For if by her kings are advanced to their rule. and if from her monarchy derives its strength, it follows of necessity that Wisdom is displayed to us as a king-maker, and transfers to herself the blame of those who bear evil rule in their kingdoms. But we know of kings who in truth advance under the guidance of Wisdom to the rule that has no end-the poor in spirit, whose possession is the kingdom of heaven[fn-13-P1338_721882:23-nf] , as the Lord promises, Who is the Wisdom of the Gospel: and such also we recognize as the princes who bear rule over their passions, who are not enslaved by the dominion of sin, who inscribe the decree of equity upon their own life, as it were upon a tablet. Thus, too, that laudable despotism which changes, by the alliance of Wisdom, the democracy of the passions into the monarchy of reason, brings into bondage what were running unrestrained into mischievous liberty, I mean all carnal and earthly thoughts: for \"the flesh lusteth against the Spirit[fn-13-P1339_722457:24-nf] ,\" and rebels against the government of the soul.

For among the works of the flesh which he said were manifest, and which he cited for condemnation, we find not only those which concern the pleasure of the flesh, as fornications, uncleanness, lasciviousness, drunkenness, revellings, but also those which, though they be remote from fleshly pleasure, reveal the vices of the soul. For who does not see that idolatries, witchcrafts, hatreds, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, heresies, envyings, are vices rather of the soul than of the flesh? For it is quite possible for a man to abstain from fleshly pleasures for the sake of idolatry or some heretical error; and yet, even when he does so, he is proved by this apostolic authority to be living after the flesh; and in abstaining from fleshly pleasure, he is proved to be practising damnable works of the flesh. Who that has enmity has it not in his soul? or who would say to his enemy, or to the man he thinks his enemy, You have a bad flesh towards me, and not rather, You have a bad spirit towards me? In fine, if any one heard of what I may call \"carnalities,\" he would not fail to attribute them to the carnal part of man; so no one doubts that \"animosities\" belong to the soul of man.

Overcome with envy, he slew his own brother, a citizen of the eternal city, and a sojourner on earth. So that we cannot be surprised that this first specimen, or, as the Greeks say, archetype of crime, should, long afterwards, find a corresponding crime at the foundation of that city which was destined to reign over so many nations, and be the head of this earthly city of which we speak. For of that city also, as one of their poets has mentioned, \"the first walls were stained with a brother's blood,\"[fn-25-P2553_1420041:8-nf] or, as Roman history records, Remus was slain by his brother Romulus. And thus there is no difference between the foundation of this city and of the earthly city, unless it be that Romulus and Remus were both citizens of the earthly city. Both desired to have the glory of founding the Roman republic, but both could not have as much glory as if one only claimed it; for he who wished to have the glory of ruling would certainly rule less if his power were shared by a living consort. In order, therefore, that the whole glory might be enjoyed by one, his consort was removed; and by this crime the empire was made larger indeed, but inferior, while otherwise it would have been less, but better. Now these brothers, Cain and Abel, were not both animated by the same earthly desires, nor did the murderer envy the other because he feared that, by both ruling, his own dominion would be curtailed,-for Abel was not solicitous to rule in that city which his brother built,-he was moved by that diabolical, envious hatred with which the evil regard the good, for no other reason than because they are good while themselves are evil. For the possession of goodness is by no means diminished by being shared with a partner either permanent or temporarily assumed; on the contrary, the possession of goodness is increased in proportion to the concord and charity of each of those who share it. In short, he who is unwilling to share this possession cannot have it; and he who is most willing to admit others to a share of it will have the greatest abundance to himself. The quarrel, then, between Romulus and Remus shows how the earthly city is divided against itself; that which fell out between Cain and Abel illustrated the hatred that subsists between the two cities, that of God and that of men. The wicked war with the wicked; the good also war with the wicked. But with the good, good men, or at least perfectly good men, cannot war;though, while only going on towards perfection, they war to this extent, that every good man resists others in those points in which he resists himself.

For He had said, \"Thou hast sinned,\" and then He added, \"Fret not thyself, for to thee shall be its turning, and thou shall rule over it.\"[fn-25-P2574_1431075:22-nf] And the \"turning\" of sin to the man can be understood of his conviction that the guilt of sin can be laid at no other man's door but his own.

It was this which God enjoined on him who was kindled with the fire of envy against his brother, so that he sought to put out of the way him whom he should have set as an example. \"Fret not thyself,\" or compose thyself, He says: withhold thy hand from crime; let not sin reign in your mortal body to fulfill it in the lusts thereof, nor yield your members instruments of unrighteousness unto sin. \"For to thee shall be its turning,\" so long as you do not encourage it by giving it the rein, but bridle it by quenching its fire. \"And thou shall rule over it;\" for when it is not allowed any external actings, it yields itself to the rule of the governing mind and righteous will, and ceases from even internal motions. There is something similar said in the same divine book of the woman, when God questioned and judged them after their sin, and pronounced sentence on them all,-the devil in the form of the serpent, the woman and her husband in their own persons. For when He had said to her, \"I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow shall thou bring forth children,\" then He added, \"and thy turning shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.\"[fn-25-P2578_1433939:26-nf] What is said to Cain about his sin, or about the vicious concupiscence of his flesh, is here said of the woman who had sinned; and we are to understand that the husband is to rule his wife as the soul rules the flesh.

He was also a figure of the Jews who slew Christ the Shepherd of the flock of men, prefigured by Abel the shepherd of sheep: but as this is an allegorical and prophetical matter, I forbear to explain it now; besides, I remember that I have made some remarks upon it in writing against Faustus the Manichaean.[fn-25-P2580_1434988:28-nf] ","title":"Book XV","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_21_book_xv_","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"84","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"32.

There is sorrow, called in Greek lu/ph, and joy, in Greek xara/ or h9donh/, although many translate the latter word by voluptas, pleasure; the one of which is referred to evil, the other to good. And we go too far if we rejoice over such things as we ought not, as, for example, riches, power, distinctions, the bad fortune of enemies, or their death; or, on the other hand, if we are tortured with grief on account of present evils, adversity, exile, poverty, weakness, and the death of kindred, all of which is forbidden by the Apostle. And again, if we covet those things which we consider good, inheritance, distinctions, unvaried prosperity, bodily health, and the like, in the possession of which we rejoice and find enjoyment; or if we fear those things which we deem adverse. Now, according to the Stoics, Zeno that is to say and Chrysippus, it is possible for a perfect man to be free from these emotions; according to the Peripatetics, it is difficult and even impossible, an opinion which has the constant support of all Scripture. Hence Josephus, the historian of the Maccabees, said that the emotions can be subdued and governed, not extirpated, and Cicero's five books of \"Tusculan Disputations\" are full of these discussions.[fn-75-P7534_2487868:2-nf] Accordto the Apostle, the weakness of the body and spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places fight against us.

And inasmuch as each is the gift of God (although one is less, and the other greater), he must not extol our righteousness above the praise which is due to Him who justifies us, in such a way as to assign to the lesser of these two gifts the help of divine grace, and to claim the greater one for the human will. And should he consent that we receive love from the grace of God, he must not suppose that any merits of our own preceded our reception of the gift. For what merits could we possibly have had at the time when we loved not God? In order, indeed, that we might receive that love whereby we might love, we were loved while as yet we had no love ourselves. This the Apostle John most expressly declares: \"Not that we loved God,\" says he, \"but that He loved us;\"[fn-33-P3355_1298011:74-nf] and again, \"We love Him, because He first loved us.\"[fn-33-P3356_1298084:75-nf] Most excellently and truly spoken!

It is true that a thing which is not an object of hope may be believed. What true Christian, for example, does not believe in the punishment of the wicked? And yet such an one does not hope for it. And the man who believes that punishment to be hanging over himself, and who shrinks in horror from the prospect, is more properly said to fear than to hope. And these two states of mind the poet carefully distinguishes, when he says: \"Permit the fearful to have hope.\"[fn-22-P2223_1107238:10-nf] Another poet, who is usually much superior to this one, makes a wrong use of the word, when he says: \"If I have been able to hope for so great a grief as this.\"[fn-22-P2224_1107426:11-nf] And some grammarians take this case as an example of impropriety of speech, saying, \"He said sperare [to hope] instead of timere [to fear].\" Accordingly, faith may have for its object evil as well as good; for both good and evil are believed, and the faith that believes them is not evil, but good. Faith, moreover, is concerned with the past, the present, and the future, all three. We believe, for example, that Christ died,-an event in the past; we believe that He is sitting at the right hand of God,-a state of things which is present; we believe that He will come to judge the quick and the dead,-an event of the future. Again, faith applies both to one's own circumstances and those of others. Every one, for example, believes that his own existence had a beginning, and was not eternal, and he believes the same both of other men and other things. Many of our beliefs in regard to religious matters, again, have reference not merely to other men, but to angels also. But hope has for its object only what is good, only what is future, and only what affects the man who entertains the hope. For these reasons, then, faith must be distinguished from hope, not merely as a matter of verbal propriety, but because they are essentially different. The fact that we do not see either what we believe or what we hope for, is all that is common to faith and hope. In the Epistle to the Hebrews, for example, faith is defined (and eminent defenders of the catholic faith have used the definition as a standard) \"the evidence of things not seen.\"[fn-22-P2225_1109000:12-nf] Although, should any one say that he believes, that is, has grounded his faith, not on words, nor on witnesses, nor on any reasoning whatever, but on the direct evidence of his own senses, he would not be guilty of such an impropriety of speech as to be justly liable to the criticism, \"You saw,therefore you did not believe.\" And hence it does not follow that an object of faith is not an object of sight. But it is better that we should use the word \"faith\" as the Scriptures have taught us, applying it to those things which are not seen. Concerning hope, again, the apostle says: \"Hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.\"[fn-22-P2226_1109756:13-nf] When, then, we believe that good is about to come, this is nothing else but to hope for it. Now what shall I say of love? Without it, faith profits nothing; and in its absence, hope cannot exist. The Apostle James says: \"The devils also believe, and tremble.\"[fn-22-P2227_1110040:14-nf] -that is, they, having neither hope nor love, but believing that what we love and hope for is about to come, are in terror. And so the Apostle Paul approves and commends the \"faith that worketh by love;\"[fn-22-P2228_1110262:15-nf] and this certainly cannot exist without hope.

Wherefore it is said, \"Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God;\" and, as if in explanation of this, \"neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.\"[fn-26-P2644_1241787:182-nf] What the apostle first called \"flesh and blood,\" he afterwards calls \"corruption;\" and what he first called \"the kingdom of God,\" he afterwards calls \"incorruption.\" But as far as regards the substance, even then it shall be flesh. For even after the resurrection the body of Christ was called flesh.[fn-26-P2645_1242110:183-nf] The apostle, however, says: \"It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body;\"[fn-26-P2646_1242220:184-nf] because so perfect shah then be the harmony between flesh and spirit, the spirit keeping alive the subjugated flesh without the need of any nourishment, that no part of our nature shall be in discord with another; but as we shall be free from enemies without, so we shall not have ourselves for enemies within.","title":"Introductory Notice","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_23_introductory_notice","source_chapter":119,"source_paragraph":"372","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"And now as to love, which the apostle declares to be greater than the other two graces, that is, than faith and hope,[fn-27-P2767_1281875:227-nf] the greater the measure in which it dwells in a man, the better is the man in whom it dwells. For when there is a question as to whether a man is good, one does not ask what he believes, or what he hopes, but what he loves. For the man who loves aright no doubt believes and hopes aright; whereas the man who has not love believes in vain, even though his beliefs are true; and hopes in vain, even though the objects of his hope are a real part of true happiness; unless, indeed, he believes and hopes for this, that he may obtain by prayer the blessing of love. For, although it is not possible to hope without love, it may yethappen that a man does not love that which is necessary to the attainment of his hope; as, for example, if he hopes for eternal life (and who is there that does not desire this?) and yet does not love righteousness, without which no one can attain to eternal life. Now this is the true faith of Christ which the apostle speaks of, \"which worketh by love;\"[fn-27-P2768_1282884:228-nf] and if there is anything that it does not yet embrace in its love, asks that it may receive, seeks that it may find, and knocks that it may be opened unto it.[fn-27-P2769_1283061:229-nf] For faith obtains through prayer that which the law commands.

He asserts that the word \"Lord\" is significative of essence, and by way of proof of this assumption he brings up the passage above mentioned. \"The Lord,\" it says, \"is the Spirit[fn-17-P1750_1009311:2-nf] .\" But our friend who interprets Scripture at his own sweet will calls \"Lordship\" by the name of \"essence,\" and thinks to bring his statement to proof by means of the words quoted. Well, if it had been said by Paul, \"Now the Lord is essence,\" we too would have concurred in his argument. But seeing that the inspired writing on the one side says, \"the Lord is the Spirit,\" and Eunomius says on the other, \"Lordship is essence,\" I do not know where he finds support for his statement, unless he is prepared to say again[fn-17-P1751_1009849:3-nf] that the word \"Spirit\" stands in Scripture for \"essence.\" Let us consider, then, whether the Apostle anywhere, in his use of the term \"Spirit,\" employs that word to indicate \"essence.\" He says, \"The Spirit itself beareth witness with our Spirit[fn-17-P1752_1010220:4-nf] ,\" and \"no one knoweth the things of a man save the Spirit of man which is in him[fn-17-P1753_1010320:5-nf] ,\" and \"the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life[fn-17-P1754_1010393:6-nf] ,\" and \"if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live[fn-17-P1755_1010492:7-nf] ,\" and \"if we live in the Spirit let us also walk in the Spirit[fn-17-P1756_1010574:8-nf] .\" Who indeed could count the utterances of the Apostle on this point? and in them we nowhere find \"essence\" signified by this word. For he who says that \"the Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit,\" signifies nothing else than the Holy Spirit Which comes to be in the mind of the faithful; for in many other passages of his writings he gives the name of spirit to the mind, on the reception by which of the communion of the Spirit the recipients attain the dignity of adoption. Again, in the passage, \"No one knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him,\" if \"man\" is used of the essence, and \"spirit\" likewise, it will follow from the phrase that the man is maintained to be of two essences. Again, I know not how he who says that \"the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life,\" sets \"essence\" in opposition to \"letter\"; nor, again, how this writer imagines that when Paul says that we ought \"through the Spirit\" to destroy \"the deeds of the body,\" he is directing the signification of \"spirit\" to express \"essence\"; while as for \"living in the Spirit,\" and \"walking in the Spirit,\" this would be quite unintelligible if the sense of the word \"Spirit\" referred to \"essence.\" For in what else than in essence do all we who are alive partake of life?-thus when the Apostle is laying down advice for us on this matter that we should \"live in essence,\" it is as though he said \"partake of life by means of yourselves, and not by means of others.\" If then it is not possible that this sense can be adopted in any passage, how can Eunomius here once more imitate the interpreters of dreams, and bid us to take \"spirit.\" for \"essence,\" to the end that he may arrive in due syllogistic form at his conclusion that the word \"Lord\" is applied to the essence?-for if \"spirit\" is \"essence\" (he argues), and \"the Lord is Spirit,\" the \"Lord\" is clearly found to be \"essence.\" How incontestable is the force of this attempt! How can we evade or resolve this irrefragable necessity of demonstration? The word \"Lord,\" he says, is spoken of the essence. How does he maintain it? Because the Apostle says, \"The Lord is the Spirit.\" Well, what has this to do with essence? He gives us the further instruction that \"spirit\" is put for \"essence. These are the arts of his demonstrative method! These are the results of his Aristotelian science! This is why, in your view, we are so much to be pitied, who are uninitiated in this wisdom! and you of course are to be deemed happy, who track out the truth by a method like this-that the Apostle's meaning was such that we are to suppose \"the Spirit\" was put by him for the Essence of the Only-begotten!","title":"Book VII","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_114_treatise_iv_on_the_lord_s_prayer_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"ANF-05","text":"16.

Our very righteousness, too, though true in so far as it has respect to the true good, is yet in this life of such a kind that it consists rather in the remission of sins than in the perfecting of virtues. Witness the prayer of the whole city of God in its pilgrim state, for it cries to God by the mouth of all its members, \"Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.\"[fn-37-P3754_2072159:48-nf] And this prayer is efficacious not for those whose faith is \"without works and dead,\"[fn-37-P3755_2072264:49-nf] but for those whose faith \"worketh by love.\"[fn-37-P3756_2072327:50-nf] For as reason, though subjected to God, is yet \"pressed down by the corruptible body,\"[fn-37-P3757_2072430:51-nf] so long as it is in this mortal condition, it has not perfect authority over vice, and therefore this prayer is needed by the righteous. For though it exercises authority, the vices do not submit without a struggle. For however well one maintains the conflict, and however thoroughly he has subdued these enemies, there steals in some evil thing, which, if it does not find ready expression in act, slips out by the lips, or insinuates itself into the thought; and therefore his peace is not full so long as he is at war with his vices. For it is a doubtful conflict he wages with those that resist, and his victory over those that are defeated is not secure, but full of anxiety and effort. Amidst these temptations, therefore, of all which it has been summarily said in the divine oracles, \"Is not human life upon earth a temptation?\"[fn-37-P3758_2073287:52-nf] who but a proud man can presume that he so lives that he has no need to say to God, \"Forgive us our debts?\" And such a man is not great, but swollen and puffed up with vanity, and is justly resisted by Him who abundantly gives grace to the humble.

But, in that final peace to which all our righteousness has reference, and for the sake of which it is maintained, as our nature shall enjoy a sound immortality and incorruption, and shall have no more vices, and as we shall experience no resistance either from ourselves or from others, it will not be necessary that reason should rule vices which no longer exist, but God shall rule the man, and the soul shall rule the body, with a sweetness and facility suitable to the felicity of a life which is done with bondage.

But what we, who, in the words of the Apostle, have been called to liberty by Christ[fn-19-P1997_1202234:40-nf] , Who hath freed us from bondage, have been taught by the Scriptures to think, I will set forth in few words. I take my start from the inspired teaching, and boldly declare that the Divine Word does not wish even us to be slaves, our nature having now been changed for the better, and that He Who has taken all that was ours, on the terms of giving to us in return what is His, even as He took disease, death, curse, and sin, so took our slavery also, not in such a way as Himself to have what He took, but so as to purge our nature of such evils, our defects being swallowed up and done away with in His stainless nature. As therefore in the life that we hope for there will be neither disease, nor curse, nor sin, nor death, so slavery also along with these will vanish away. And that what I say is true I call the Truth Himself to witness, Who says to His disciples \"I call you no more servants, but friends[fn-19-P1998_1203166:41-nf] .\" If then our nature will be free at length from the reproach of slavery, how comes the Lord of all to be reduced to slavery by the madness and infatuation of these deranged men, who must of course, as a logical consequence, assert that He does not know the counsels of the Father, because of His declaration concerning the slave, which tells us that \"the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth[fn-19-P1999_1203589:42-nf] \"? But when they say this, let them hear that the Son has in Himself all that pertains to the Father, and sees all things that the Father doeth, and none of the good things that belong to the Father is outside the knowledge of the Son. For how can He fail to have anything that is the Father's, seeing He has the Father wholly in Himself? Accordingly, if \"the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth,\" and if He has in Himself all things that are the Father's, let those who are reeling with strong drink at last become sober, and let them now, if never before, look up at the truth, and see that He who has all things that the Father has is lord of all, and not a slave. For how can the personality that owns no lord over it bear on itself the brand of slavery? How can the King of all fail to have His form of like honour with Himself? how can dishonour-for slavery is dishonour-constitute the brightness of the true glory? and how is the King's son born into slavery? No, it is not so. But as He is Light of Light, and Life of Life, and Truth of Truth, so is He Lord of Lord, King of King, God of God, Supreme of Supreme; for having in Himself the Father in His entirety, whatever the Father has in Himself He also assuredly has, and since, moreover, all that the Son has belongs to the Father, the enemies of God's glory are inevitably compelled, if the Son is a slave, to drag down to servitude the Father as well. For there is no attribute of the Son which is not absolutely the Father's. \"For all Mine are Thine,\" He says, \"and Thine are Mine[fn-20-P2000_1205165:43-nf] .\" What then will the poor creatures say? Which is more reasonable-that the Son, Who has said, \"Thine are Mine, and I am glorified in them[fn-20-P2001_1205327:44-nf] ,\" should be glorified in the sovereignty of the Father, or that insult should be offered to the Father by the degradation involved in the slavery of the Son? For it is not possible that He Who contains in Himself all that belongs to the Son, and Who is Himself in the Son, should not also absolutely be in the slavery of the Son, and have slavery in Himself. Such are the results achieved by Eunomius' philosophy, whereby he inflicts upon his Lord the insult of slavery, while he attaches the same degradation to the stainless glory of the Father.","title":"Book X","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_27_book_xxi","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"96","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Nevertheless, in the \"heavy yoke that is laid upon the sons of Adam, from the day that they go out of their mother's womb to the day that they return to the mother of all things,\" there is found an admirable though painful monitor teaching us to be sober-minded, and convincing us that this life has become penal in consequence of that outrageous wickedness which was perpetrated in Paradise, and that all to which the New Testament invites belongs to that future inheritance which awaits us in the world to come, and is offered for our acceptance, as the earnest that we may, in its own due time, obtain that of which it is the pledge.

If, however, absolutely nothing of our flesh were in captivity, not even to the devil, because there has accrued to it the remission of sin, that sin be not imputed to it (and this is properly designated the law of sin); yet if under this law of sin, that is, under its own concupiscence, our flesh were not to some degree held captive, how could that be true which the apostle states, when he speaks of our \"waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body\"?[fn-40-P4047_1527304:119-nf] In so far, then, as there is now this waiting for the redemption of our body, there is also in some degree still existing something in us which is a captive to the law of sin. Accordingly he exclaims, \"O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? The grace of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.\"[fn-40-P4048_1527654:120-nf] What are we to understand by such language, but that our body, which is undergoing corruption, weighs heavily on our soul? When, therefore, this very body of ours shall be restored to us in an incorrupt state, there shall be a full liberation from the body of this death; but there will be no such deliverance for them who shall rise again to condemnation. To the body of this death then is understood to be owing the circumstance that there is in our members another law which wars against the law of the mind, so long as the flesh lusts against the spirit-without, however, subjugating the mind, inasmuch as on its side, too, the spirit has a concupiscence contrary to the flesh.[fn-40-P4049_1528358:121-nf] Thus, although the actual law of sin partly holds the flesh in captivity (whence comes its resistance to the law of the mind), still it has not an absolute empire in our body, notwithstanding its mortal state, since it refuses obedience to its desires,[fn-40-P4050_1528630:122-nf] For in the case of hostilearmies between whom there is an earnest conflict, even the side which is inferior in the fightusually holds a something which it has captured; and although in some such way there is somewhat in our flesh which is kept under the law of sin, yet it has before it the hope of redemption: and then there will remain not a particle of this corrupt concupiscence; but our flesh, healed of that diseased plague, and wholly clad in immortality, shall live for evermore in eternal blessedness.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_28_book_xxii","source_chapter":25,"source_paragraph":"117","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"But, irrespective of the miseries which in this life are common to the good and bad, the righteous undergo labors peculiar to themselves, in so far as they make war upon their vices, and are involved in the temptations and perils of such a contest.

Here therefore these men too evil, while they essay to make void the Law, force us to approve these Scriptures. For they mark what is said, that they who are under the Law are in bondage, and they keep flying above the rest that last saying, \"Ye are made empty[fn-34-P3425_1576634:23-nf] of Christ, as many of you as are justified in the Law; ye have fallen from Grace.\"[fn-34-P3426_1576734:24-nf] We grant that all these things are true, and we say that the Law is not necessary, save for them unto whom bondage is yet profitable: and that the Law was on this account profitably enacted, in that men, who could not be recalled from sins by reason, needed to be restrained by such a Law, that is to say, by the threats and terrors of those punishments which can be seen by fools: from which when the Grace of Christ sets us free, it condemns not that Law, but invites us at length to yield obedience to its love, not to be slaves to the fear of the Law. Itself is Grace, that is free gift,[fn-34-P3427_1577342:25-nf] which they understand not to have come to them from God, who still desire to be under the bonds of the Law. Whom Paul deservedly rebukes as unbelievers, because they do not believe that now through our Lord Jesus they have been set free from that bondage, under which they were placed for a certain time by the most just appointment of God. Hence is that saying of the same Apostle, \"For the Law was our schoolmaster in Christ.\"[fn-34-P3428_1577789:26-nf] He therefore gave to men a schoolmaster to fear, Who after gave a Master to love. And yet in these precepts and commands of the Law, which now it is not allowed Christians to use, such as either the Sabbath, or Circumcision, or Sacrifices, and if there be any thing of this kind, so great mysteries are contained, as that every pious person may understand, there is nothing more deadly than that whatever is there be understood to the letter, that is, to the word:[fn-34-P3429_1578286:27-nf] and nothing more healthful than that it be unveiled in the Spirit. Hence it is: \"The letter killeth, but the Spirit quickeneth.\"[fn-34-P3430_1578432:28-nf] Hence it is, \"That same veil remaineth in the reading of the Old Testament, which veil is not taken away; since it is made void in Christ.\"[fn-34-P3431_1578926:29-nf] For there is made void in Christ, not the Old Testament, but its veil: that so through Christ that may be understood, and, as it were, laid bare, which without Christ is obscure and covered. Forasmuch as the same Apostle straightway adds, \"But when thou shalt have passed over to Christ, the veil shall be taken away.\"[fn-34-P3432_1579306:30-nf] For he saith not, the Law shall be taken away, or, the Old Testament. Not therefore through the Grace of the Lord, as though useless things were there hidden, have they been taken away; but ratherthe covering whereby useful things were covered. In this manner all they are dealt with, who earnestly and piously, not disorderly and shamelessly, seek the sense of those Scriptures, and they are carefully shown both the order of events, and the causes of deeds and words, and so great agreement of the Old Testament with the New, that there is left no jot[fn-34-P3433_1579881:31-nf] that agrees not; and so great secrets of figures, that all the things that are drawn forth by interpretation force them to confess that they are wretched, who will to condemn these before they learn them.","title":"On the Profit of Believing.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_29_book_xvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"25","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"22. In the passage, \"Thou shalt see thy life hanging, and shalt not believe thy life,\"[fn-17-P1714_959924:37-nf] Faustus is deceived by the ambiguity of the words. The words may be differently interpreted; but that they cannot be understood of Christ is not said by Faustus, nor can be said by anyone who does not deny that Christ is life, or that He was seen by the Jews hanging on the cross, or that they did not believe Him. Since Christ Himself says, \"I am the life,\"[fn-17-P1715_960306:38-nf] and since there is no doubt that He was seen hanging by the unbelieving Jews, I see no reason for doubting that this was written of Christ; for, as Christ says, Moses wrote of Him. Since we have already refuted Faustus' arguments by which he tries to show that the words, \"I will raise up from among their brethren a prophet like unto thee,\" do not apply to Christ, because Christ is not like Moses, we need not insist on this other prophecy. Since, in the one case, his argument is that Christ is unlike Moses, so here he ought to argue that Christ is not the life, or that He was not seen hanging by the unbelieving Jews. But as he has not said this, and as no one will now venture to say so, there should be no difficulty in accepting this too as a prophecy of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, uttered by His servant. These words, says Faustus, occur in a chapter of curses. But why should it be the less a prophecy because it occurs in the midst of prophecies? Or why should it not be a prophecy of Christ, although the context does not seem to refer to Christ? Indeed, among all the curses which the Jews brought on themselves by their sinful pride, nothing could be worse than this, that they should see their Life-that is, the Son of God -hanging, and should not believe their Life. For the curses of prophecy are not hostile imprecations, but announcements of coming judgment. Hostile imprecations are forbidden, for it is said, \"Bless, and curse not.\"[fn-17-P1716_961788:39-nf] But prophetic announcements are often found in the writings of the saints, as when the Apostle Paul says: \"Alexander the coppersmith has done me much evil; the Lord shall reward him according to his works.\"[fn-17-P1717_962014:40-nf] So it might be thought that the apostle was prompted by angry feeling to utter this imprecation: \"I would that they were even made eunuchs that trouble you.\"[fn-17-P1718_962192:41-nf] But if we remember who the writer is, we may see in this ambiguous expression an ingenious style of benediction. For there are eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake.[fn-17-P1719_962413:42-nf] If Faustus had a pious appetite for Christian food, he would have found a similar ambiguity in the words of Moses. By the Jews the declaration, \"Thou shalt see thy life hanging, and shalt not believe thy life,\" may have been understood to mean that they would see their life to be in danger from the threats and plots of their enemies, and would not expect to live. But the child of the Gospel, who has heard Christ say, \"He wrote of me.\" distinguishes in the ambiguity of the prophecy between what is thrown to swine and what is addressed to man. To his mind the thought immediately suggests itself of Christ hanging as the life of man, and of the Jews not believing in Him for this very reason, that they saw Him hanging. As to the objection that these words, \"Thou shalt see thy life hanging, and shalt not believe thy life,\" are the only words referring to Christ in a passage containing maledictions not applicable to Christ, some might grant that this is true. For this prophecy might very well occur among the curses pronounced by the prophet upon the ungodly people, for these curses are of different kinds. But I, and those who with me. consider more closely the saying of the Lord in His Gospel, which is not, He wrote also of me, as admitting that Moses wrote other things not referring to Christ, but, \"He wrote of me,\" as teaching that in searching the Scriptures we should view them as intended solely to illustrate the grace of Christ, see a reference to Christ in the rest of the passage also. But it would take too much time to explain this here.","title":"Book XVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_12_book_viii_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"ANF-05","text":"And certain other (heretics), contentious by nature, (and) wholly uniformed as regards knowledge, as well as in their manner more (than usually) quarrelsome, combine (in maintaining) that Easter should be kept on the fourteenth day[fn-21-P2109_658839:39-nf] of the first month, according to the commandment of the law, on whatever day (of the week) it should occur.

And also, when he exhorts us, that we live not after the flesh, lest we die, but that by the Spirit we mortify the deeds of the flesh, that we may live; surely the trumpet which sounds, shows the war in which we are engaged, and enkindles us to contend keenly, and to do our enemies to death,[fn-36-P3608_1703767:26-nf] that we be not done to death by them. But who those enemies are, it hath set forth plainly enough. I For those are they, whom it willed should be done to death by us, that is to say, the works of the flesh. For so it saith, \"But if by the Spirit ye shall mortify the deeds of the flesh, ye shall live.\" And in order that we may know what these are, let us hear the same in like manner writing unto the Galatians, and saying, \"But the works of the flesh are manifest, which are, fornications, uncleannesses, luxuries, idolatry, witchcrafts, hatreds, contentions, emulations, wraths, strifes, heresies, envyings, drunkennesses, revellings, and such like; of which I foretell to you, as I have foretold, that they who do such things shall not possess the kingdom of God.\"[fn-36-P3609_1704555:27-nf] For the very war there also was he showing, that he should speak of these, and unto the death-doing of these enemies was he calling up the soldiers of Christ by the same heavenly and spiritual trumpet. For he had said above, \"But I say, walk in the Spirit, and perform ye not the lusts of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh. For these are opposed one to the other, that ye do not what ye would. But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the Law.\"[fn-36-P3610_1705081:28-nf] Therefore being set under Grace, he would have them have that conflict against the works of the flesh. And in order to point out these works of the flesh, he added what I have mentioned above. \"But the works of the flesh are manifest, which are, fornications,\" and the rest, whether what he mentioned, or whether what he admonished were to be understood, chiefly as he added, \"and such like.\" Lastly, in this battle, against what is in a manner the carnal army leading forth as it were another spiritual line, \"But the fruit of the Spirit is,\" saith he, \"charity, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness,faith, gentleness,continence; against such there is no law.\"[fn-36-P3611_1705787:29-nf] He saith not \"against these,\" lest they should be thought to be alone: although even were he to say this, we ought to understand all, whatever goods of the same kind we could think of: but he saith, \"against such,\" that is to say, both these and whatsoever are such like.

All we therefore, who believe in the Living and True God, Whose Nature, being in the highest sense good and incapable of change, neither doth any evil, nor suffers any evil, from Whom is every good, even that which admits of decrease, and Who admits not at all of decrease in His own Good, Which is Himself, when we hear the Apostle saying, \"Walk in the Spirit, and perform ye not the lusts of the flesh.

Altogether these two are both good; both the Spirit is a good, and the flesh a good: and man, who is composed of both, one ruling, the other obeying, is assuredly a good, but a good capable of change, which yet could not be made save by a Good incapable of change, by Whom was created every good, whether small or great; but how small soever, yet made by What is Great; and how great soever, yet no way to be compared with the greatness of the Maker. But in this nature of man, that is good, and well formed and ordered by One That is Good, there is now war, since there is not yet health. Let the sickness be healed, there is peace. But that sickness fault hath deserved, not nature hath had. And this fault indeed through the layer of regeneration the grace of God hath already remitted unto the faithful; but under the hands of the same Physician nature as yet striveth with its sickness. But in such a conflict victory will be entire soundness; and that, soundness not for a time, but for ever: wherein not only this sickness is to come to an end, but also none to arise after it. Wherefore the just man addresseth his soul and saith, \"Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His returns: Who becometh propitious to all thy iniquities, Who healeth all thy sicknesses.\"[fn-36-P3650_1724162:59-nf] He becometh propitious to our iniquities, when He pardons sins: He heals sicknesses when He restrains evil desires. He becometh propitious unto iniquities by the grant of forgiveness: He heals sicknesses, by the grant of continence. The one was done in Baptism to persons confessing; the other is done in the strife to persons contending; wherein through His help we are to overcome our disease.

Whence also the above-mentioned Apostle saith not, \"Every one is tempted\" by lust, but added, \"by his own:\" that he who hears this may understand, how he ought to cry, \"I said, Lord, have mercy upon me, heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee.\"[fn-36-P3653_1725315:62-nf] For it would not have needed healing, had it not corrupted[fn-36-P3654_1725391:63-nf] itself by sinning, so that its own flesh should lust against it, that is, itself should be opposed to itself, on that side, wherein in the flesh it was made sick.","title":"On Continence.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_31_on_continence_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"25","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"20.

The Apostle shows both, that neither is good here perfected, where evil is so lusted after, nor evil here perfected, whereas such lust is not obeyed. The one forsooth he shows, where he says, \"To will is present with me, but to perfect good is not;\"[fn-36-P3662_1728627:69-nf] the other, where he says, \"Walk in the Spirit, and perfect not the lusts of the flesh.\"[fn-36-P3663_1728734:70-nf] For neither in the former place doth he say that to do good is not with him, but \"to perfect,\" nor here doth he say, Have not \"lusts of the flesh,\" but \"perfect not.\" Therefore there take place in us evil lusts, when that pleases which is not lawful; but they are not perfected, when evil lusts are restrained by the mind serving the Law of God. And good takes place, when that, which wrongly pleases, takes not place through the good delight prevailing. But the perfection of good is not fulfilled, so long as by the flesh serving the law of sin, evil lust entices, and, although it be restrained, is yet moved. For there would be no need for it to be restrained, were it not moved. There will be at some time also the perfection of good, when the destruction of evil: the one will be highest, the other will be no more. And if we think that this is to be hoped for in this mortal state, we are deceived. For it shall be then, when death shall not be; and it shall be there, where shall be life eternal.

Therefore the flesh is not evil, if it be void of evil, that is, of fault, whereby man was rendered faulty, not made ill, but himself making. For on either part, that is, both soul and body, being made good by the good God, himself made the evil, whereby he was made evil. From the guilt of which evil being already also set free through forgiveness,[fn-36-P3665_1730295:72-nf] that he may not think what he hath done to be light, he yet wars with his own fault through continence. But far be it that there be any faults in such as reign in that peace which shall be hereafter; since in this state of war there are lessened daily in such as make progress, not sins only, but the very lusts also, with which, by not consenting, we strive, and by consenting unto which we sin.","title":"On Continence.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_31_on_continence_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"22.

But, say they, how is the flesh by a certain likeness compared unto the Church? What! doth the Church lust against Christ? whereas the same Apostle said, \"The Church is subject unto Christ.\"[fn-36-P3690_1741741:92-nf] Clearly the Church is subject unto Christ; because the spirit therefore lusteth against the flesh, that on every side the Church may be made subject to Christ; but the flesh lusteth against the spirit, because not as yet hath the Church received that peace which was promised perfect. And for this reason the Church is made subject unto Christ for the pledge of salvation, and the flesh lusteth against the spirit from the weakness of sickness. For neither were those other than members of the Church, unto whom he thus spake, \"Walk in the spirit, and fulfill not the lusts of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; for these are opposed the one to the other; that ye do not what we would.\"[fn-36-P3691_1742498:93-nf] These things were assuredly spoken unto the Church, which if it were not made subject unto Christ, the spirit would not in it lust against the flesh through continence. By reason of which they were indeed able not to perfect the lusts of the flesh, but through the flesh lusting against the Spirit they were not able to do the things which they would, that is, not even to have the very lusts of the flesh. Lastly, why should we not confess that in spiritual men the Church is subject unto Christ, but in carnal men yet lusteth against Christ? Did not they lust against Christ unto whom it was said, \"Is Christ divided?\"[fn-36-P3692_1743141:94-nf] and, \"I could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal. I have given unto yon milk to drink as unto babes in Christ, not meat, for ye were not as yet able; but not even now are ye able: for ye are still carnal. For whereas there is among you emulation, and strife, are ye not carnal?\"[fn-36-P3693_1743461:95-nf] Against whom doth emulation and strife lust, but against Christ? For these lusts of the flesh Christ healeth in His own, but loveth in none. Whence the holy Church, so long as it hath such members, is not yet without spot or wrinkle. To these are added those other sins also, for which the daily cry of the whole Church is, \"Forgive us our debts:\"[fn-36-P3694_1743835:96-nf] and, that we should not think spiritual persons exempt from these, not any one soever of carnal persons, nor any one soever of spiritual persons themselves, but he, who lay on the breast of the Lord,[fn-36-P3695_1744054:97-nf] and whom He loved before others, saith, \"If we shall say that we have not sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\"[fn-36-P3696_1744204:98-nf] But in every sin, more in what is greater, less in what is less, there is an act of lust against righteousness. And of Christ it is written: \"Who was made unto us by God, Wisdom, and Righteousness, and Sanctification, and Redemption.\"[fn-36-P3697_1744457:99-nf] In every sin therefore without doubt there is an act of lust against Christ. But when He, Who \"healeth all our sicknesses,\"[fn-36-P3698_1744601:100-nf] a shall have led His Church unto the promised healing of sickness, then in none of its members shall there be any, even the very least spot or wrinkle. Then in no way shall the flesh lust against the spirit, and therefore there shall be no cause why the spirit also lust against the flesh. Then all this conflict shall come to an end, then there shall be the highest concord of both substances; then to such a degree shall no one there be carnal, that even the flesh itself shall be spiritual.

But that continence which is true, coming from above, wills not to repress some evils by other evils, but to heal all evils by goods. And, briefly to comprehend its mode of action, it is the place of continence to keep watch to restrain and heal all delights whatsoever of lust, which are opposed to the delight of wisdom. Whence without doubtthey set it within too narrow bounds, who limit it to restraining the lusts of the body alone: certainly they speak better, who say that it pertains to Continence to rule in general lust or desire. Which desire is set down as a fault, nor is it only of the body, but also of the soul. For, if the desire of the body be in fornications and drunkennesses; hard enmities, strifes, emulations, lastly, hatreds, their exercise in the pleasure of the body, and not rather in the motion and troubled states of the soul? Yet the Apostle called all these \"works of the flesh,\" whether what pertained to the soul, or what pertained properly to the flesh, calling forsooth the man himself by the name of the flesh.[fn-37-P3708_1752055:107-nf] Forsooth they are the works of man, whatsoever are not called works of God; forasmuch as man, who does these, lives after himself, not after God, so far as he does these. But there are other works of man, which are rather to be called works of God. \"For it is God,\"[fn-37-P3709_1752348:108-nf] saith the Apostle, \"Who worketh in you both to will and to do, according to His good pleasure.\" Whence also is that, \"For as many as are led by the spirit of God, these are sons of God.\"[fn-37-P3710_1752557:109-nf] ","title":"On Continence.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_32_book_i","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"97","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"25. Those, on the other hand, who do this in a perverse spirit, make war upon their own body as if it were a natural enemy.

For as, after the resurrection, the body, having become wholly subject to the spirit, will live in perfect peace to all eternity; even in this life we must make it an object to have the carnal habit changed for the better, so that its inordinate affections may not war against the soul. And until this shall take place, \"the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh;\" the spirit struggling, not in hatred, but for the mastery, because it desires that what it loves should be subject to the higher principle; and the flesh struggling, not in hatred, but because of the bondage of habit which it has derived from its parent stock, and which has grown in upon it by a law of nature till it has become inveterate. The spirit, then, in subduing the flesh, is working as it were to destroy the ill-founded peace of an evil habit, and to bring about the real peace which springs out of a good habit. Nevertheless, not even those who, led astray by false notions, hate their bodies would be prepared to sacrifice one eye, even supposing they could do so without suffering any pain, and that they had as much sight left in one as they formerly had in two, unless some object was to be attained which would overbalance the loss. This and other indications of the same kind are sufficient to show those who candidly seek the truth how well-founded is the statement of the apostle when he says, \"No man ever yet hated his own flesh.\" He adds too, \"but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the Church.\"[fn-47-P4735_2585376:21-nf] ","title":"Book I","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"33","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Now, from whom comes this grace, but from Him who proclaimed the promise thereof?

Yes, rather than any other. Or if another destroyed them, he only helped on the purpose of the Creator, by removing what even He had condemned. But this is not the place to discuss the question why the Creator abolished His own laws. It is enough for us to have proved that He intended such an abolition, that so it may be affirmed that the apostle determined nothing to the prejudice of the Creator, since the abolition itself proceeds from the Creator. But as, in the case of thieves, something of the stolen goods is apt to drop by the way, as a clue to their detection; so, as it seems to me, it has happened to Marcion: the last mention of Abraham's name he has left untouched (in the epistle), although no passage required his erasure more than this, even his partial alteration of the text.[fn-73-P7312_2111763:159-nf] \"For (it is written) that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bond maid, the other by a free woman; but he who was of the bond maid was born after the flesh, but he of the free woman was by promise: which things are allegorized\"[fn-73-P7313_2112197:160-nf] (that is to say, they presaged something besides the literal history); \"for these are the two covenants,\" or the two exhibitions (of the divine plans),[fn-73-P7314_2112560:161-nf] as we have found the word interpreted,\" the one from the Mount Sinai,\" in relation to the synagogue of the Jews, according to the law, \"which gendereth to bondage\"-\"the other gendereth\" (to liberty, being raised) above all principality, and power, and dominion, and every name that is l named, not only in this world, but in that which is to come, \"which is the mother of us all,\" in which we have the promise of (Christ's) holy church; by reason of which he adds in conclusion: \"So then, brethren, we are not children of the bond woman, but of the free.\"[fn-73-P7315_2113158:162-nf] In this passage he has undoubtedly shown that Christianity had a noble birth, being sprung, as the mystery of the allegory indicates, from that son of Abraham who was born of the free woman; whereas from the son of the bond maid came the legal bondage of Judaism. Both dispensations, therefore, emanate from that same God by whom,[fn-73-P7316_2113516:163-nf] as we have found, they were both sketched out beforehand. When he speaks of \"the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free,\"[fn-73-P7317_2113660:164-nf] does not the very phrase indicate that He is the Liberator who was once the Master? For Galba himself never liberated slaves which were not his own, even when about to restore free men to their liberty.[fn-73-P7318_2113881:165-nf] By Him, therefore, will liberty be bestowed, at whose command lay the enslaving power of the law. And very properly.

Christ, therefore, is the Creator's Christ, as Christ's law is the Creator's law. \"Be not deceived,[fn-73-P7335_2118258:181-nf] God is not mocked.\"[fn-73-P7336_2118324:182-nf] But Marcion's god can be mocked; for he knows not how to be angry, or how to take vengeance. \"For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.\"[fn-73-P7337_2118492:183-nf] It is then the God of recompense and judgment who threatens[fn-73-P7338_2118571:184-nf] this. \"Let us not be weary in well-doing; \"[fn-73-P7339_2118632:185-nf] and \"as we have opportunity, let us do good.\"[fn-73-P7340_2118697:186-nf] Deny now that the Creator has given a commandment to do good, and then a diversity of precept may argue a difference of gods. If, however, He also announces recompense, then from the same God must come the harvest both of death[fn-73-P7341_2118945:187-nf] and of life. But \"in due time we shall reap; \"[fn-73-P7342_2119013:188-nf] because in Ecclesiastes it is said, \"For everything there will be a time.\"[fn-73-P7343_2119107:189-nf] Moreover, \"the world is crucified unto me,\" who am a servant of the Creator-\"the world,\" (I say, ) but not the God who made the world-\"and I unto the world,\"[fn-73-P7344_2119289:190-nf] not unto the God who made the world. The world, in the apostle's sense, here means life and conversation according to worldly principles; it is in renouncing these that we and they are mutually crucified and mutually slain. He calls them \"persecutors of Christ.\"[fn-73-P7345_2119572:191-nf] But when he adds, that \"he bare in his body the scars[fn-73-P7346_2119705:192-nf] of Christ\"-since scars, of course, are accidents of body[fn-73-P7347_2119870:193-nf] -he therefore expressed the truth, that the flesh of Christ is not putative, but real and substantial,[fn-73-P7348_2119992:194-nf] the scars of which he represents as borne upon his body.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":19,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Let us now return to the resurrection, to the defence of which against heretics of all sorts we have given indeed sufficient attention in another work of ours.[fn-76-P7609_2179677:435-nf] But we will not be wanting (in some defence of the doctrine) even here, in consideration of such persons as are ignorant of that little treatise. \"What,\" asks he, \"shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not? \"[fn-76-P7610_2179974:436-nf] Now, never mind[fn-76-P7611_2180012:437-nf] that practice, (whatever it may have been.)

His only aim in alluding to it was) that he might all the more firmly insist upon the resurrection of the body, in proportion as they who were vainly baptized for the dead resorted to the practice from their belief of such a resurrection. We have the apostle in another passage defining \"but one baptism.\"[fn-76-P7615_2182023:441-nf] To be \"baptized for the dead\" therefore means, in fact, to be baptized for the body;[fn-76-P7616_2182127:442-nf] for, as we have shown, it is the body which becomes dead. What, then, shall they do who are baptized for the body,[fn-76-P7617_2182266:443-nf] if the body[fn-76-P7618_2182297:444-nf] rises not again? We stand, then, on firm ground (when we say) that[fn-76-P7619_2182380:445-nf] the next question which the apostle has discussed equally relates to the body. But \"some man will say, `How are the dead raised up? With what body do they come? '\"[fn-76-P7620_2182592:446-nf] Having established the doctrine of the resurrection which was denied, it was natural[fn-76-P7621_2182699:447-nf] to discuss what would be the sort of body (in the resurrection), of which no one had an idea. On this point we have other opponents with whom to engage, For Marcion does not in any wise admit the resurrection of the flesh, and it is only the salvation of the soul which he promises; consequently the question which he raises is not concerning the sort of body, but the very substance thereof. Notwithstanding,[fn-76-P7622_2183133:448-nf] he is most plainly refuted even from what the apostle advances respecting the quality of the body, in answer to those who ask, \"How are the dead raised up? with what body do they come? \"For as he treated of the sort of body, he of course ipso facto proclaimed in the argument that it was a body which would rise again. Indeed, since he proposes as his examples \"wheat grain, or some other grain, to which God giveth a body, such as it hath pleased Him; \"[fn-76-P7623_2183602:449-nf] since also he says, that \"to every seed is its own body; \"[fn-76-P7624_2183687:450-nf] that, consequently,[fn-76-P7625_2183729:451-nf] \"there is one kind of flesh of men, whilst there is another of beasts, and (another) of birds; that there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial; and that there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars\"[fn-76-P7626_2183999:452-nf] -does he not therefore intimate that there is to be[fn-76-P7627_2184076:453-nf] a resurrection of the flesh or body, which he illustrates by fleshly and corporeal samples? Does he not also guarantee that the resurrection shall be accomplished by that God from whom proceed all the (creatures which have served him for) examples? \"So also,\" says he, \"is the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-76-P7628_2184398:454-nf] How? Just as the grain, which is sown a body, springs up a body. This sowing of the body he called the dissolving thereof in the ground, \"because it is sown in corruption,\" (but \"is raised) to honour and power.\"[fn-76-P7629_2184632:455-nf] Now, just as in the case of the grain, so here: to Him will belong the work in the revival of the body, who ordered the process in the dissolution thereof. If, however, you remove the body from the resurrection which you submitted to the dissolution, what becomes of the diversity in the issue? Likewise, \"although it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.\"[fn-76-P7630_2185032:456-nf] Now, although the natural principle of life[fn-76-P7631_2185098:457-nf] and the spirit have each a body proper to itself, so that the \"natural body\" may fairly be taken[fn-76-P7632_2185246:458-nf] to signify the soul,[fn-76-P7633_2185289:459-nf] and \"the spiritual body\" the spirit, yet that is no reason for supposing[fn-76-P7634_2185377:460-nf] the apostle to say that the soul is to become spirit in the resurrection, but that the body (which, as being born along with the soul, and as retaining its life by means of the soul,[fn-76-P7635_2185577:461-nf] admits of being called animal (or natural[fn-76-P7636_2185634:462-nf] ) will became spiritual, since it rises through the Spirit to an eternal life. In short, since it is not the soul, but the flesh which is \"sown in corruption,\" when it turns to decay in the ground, it follows that (after such dissolution) the soul is no longer the natural body, but the flesh, which was the natural body, (is the subject of the future change), forasmuch as of a natural body it is made a spiritual body, as he says further down, \"That was not first which is spiritual.\"[fn-76-P7637_2186391:463-nf] For to this effect he just before remarked of Christ Himself: \"The first man Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.\"[fn-76-P7638_2186564:464-nf] Our heretic, however, in the excess of his folly, being unwilling that the statement should remain in this shape, altered \"last Adam\" into \"last Lord; \"[fn-76-P7639_2186739:465-nf] because he feared, of course, that if he allowed the Lord to be the last (or second) Adam, we should contend that Christ, being the second Adam, must needs belong to that God who owned also the first Adam. But the falsification is transparent. For why is there a first Adam, unless it be that there is also a second Adam? For things are not classed together unless they be severally alike, and have an identity of either name, or substance, or origin.[fn-76-P7640_2187243:466-nf] Now, although among things which are even individually diverse, one must be first and another last, yet they must have one author. If, however, the author be a different one, he himself indeed may be called the last. But the thing which he introduces is the first, and that only can be the last, which is like this first in nature.[fn-76-P7641_2187597:467-nf] It is, however, not like the first in nature, when it is not the work of the same author. In like manner (the heretic) will be refuted also with the word \"man: \" \"The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.\"[fn-76-P7642_2187852:468-nf] Now, since the first was a man, how can there be a second, unless he is a man also? Or, else, if the second is \"Lord,\" was the first \"Lord\" also?[fn-76-P7643_2188020:469-nf] It is, however, quite enough for me, that in his Gospel he admits the Son of man to be both Christ and Man; so that he will not be able to deny Him (in this passage), in the \"Adam\" and the \"man\" (of the apostle). What follows will also be too much for him. For when the apostle says, \"As is the earthy,\" that is, man, \"such also are they that are earthy\"-men again, of course; \"therefore as is the heavenly,\" meaning the Man, from heaven, \"such are the men also that are heavenly.\"[fn-76-P7644_2188772:470-nf] For he could not possibly have opposed to earthly men any heavenly beings that were not men also; his object being the more accurately to distinguish their state and expectation by using this name in common for them both. For in respect of their present state and their future expectation he calls men earthly and heavenly, still reserving their parity of name, according as they are reckoned (as to their ultimate conditions[fn-76-P7645_2189328:471-nf] ) in Adam or in Christ. Therefore, when exhorting them to cherish the hope of heaven, he says: \"As we have borne the image of the earthy, so let us also bear the image of the heavenly,\"[fn-76-P7646_2189538:472-nf] -language which relates not to any condition of resurrection life, but to the rule of the present time. He says, Let us bear, as a precept; not We shall bear, in the sense of a promise-wishing us to walk even as he himself was walking, and to put off the likeness of the earthly, that is, of the old man, in the works of the flesh. For what are this next words? \"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-76-P7647_2190535:473-nf] He means the works of the flesh and blood, which, in his Epistle to the Galatians, deprive men of the kingdom of God.[fn-76-P7648_2190675:474-nf] In other passages also he is accustomed to put the natural condition instead of the works that are done therein, as when he says, that \"they who are in the flesh cannot please God.\"[fn-76-P7649_2190879:475-nf] Now, when shall we be able to please God except whilst we are in this flesh? There is, I imagine, no other time wherein a man can work. If, however, whilst we are even naturally living in the flesh, we yet eschew the deeds of the flesh, then we shall not be in the flesh; since, although we are not absent from the substance of the flesh, we are notwithstanding strangers to the sin thereof. Now, since in the word flesh we are enjoined to put off, not the substance, but the works of the flesh, therefore in the use of the same word the kingdom of God is denied to the works of the flesh, not to the substance thereof. For not that is condemned in which evil is done, but only the evil which is done in it. To administer poison is a crime, but the cup in which it is given is not guilty. So the body is the vessel of the works of the flesh, whilst the soul which is within it mixes the poison of a wicked act. How then is it, that the soul, which is the real author of the works of the flesh, shall attain to[fn-76-P7650_2191910:476-nf] the kingdom of God, after the deeds done in the body have been stoned for, whilst the body, which was nothing but (the soul's) ministering agent, must remain in condemnation? Is the cup to be punished, but the poisoner to escape? Not that we indeed claim the kingdom of God for the flesh: all we do is, to assert a resurrection for the substance thereof, as the gate of the kingdom through which it is entered. But the resurrection is one thing, and the kingdom is another. The resurrection is first, and afterwards the kingdom. We say, therefore, that the flesh rises again, but that when changed it obtains the kingdom. \"For the dead shall be raised incorruptible,\" even those who had been corruptible when their bodies fell into decay; \"and we shall be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.[fn-76-P7651_2192734:477-nf] For this corruptible\"-and as he spake, the apostle seemingly pointed to his own flesh-\"must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\"[fn-76-P7652_2192911:478-nf] in order, indeed, that it may be rendered a fit substance for the kingdom of God. \"For we shall be like the angels.\"[fn-76-P7653_2193050:479-nf] This will be the perfect change of our flesh-only after its resurrection.[fn-76-P7654_2193164:480-nf] Now if, on the contrary,[fn-76-P7655_2193214:481-nf] there is to be no flesh, how then shall it put on incorruption and immortality? Having then become something else by its change, it will obtain the kingdom of God, no longer the (old) flesh and blood, but the body which God shall have given it. Rightly then does the apostle declare, \"Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; \"[fn-76-P7656_2193567:482-nf] for this (honour) does he ascribe to the changed condition[fn-76-P7657_2193648:483-nf] which ensues on the resurrection. Since, therefore, shall then be accomplished the word which was written by the Creator, \"O death, where is thy victory\"-or thy struggle?[fn-76-P7658_2193839:484-nf] \"O death, where is thy sting? \"[fn-76-P7659_2193928:485-nf] -written, I say, by the Creator, for He wrote them by His prophet[fn-76-P7660_2194016:486-nf] -to Him will belong the gift, that is, the kingdom, who proclaimed the word which is to be accomplished in the kingdom. And to none other God does he tell us that \"thanks\" are due, for having enabled us to achieve \"the victory\" even over death, than to Him from whom he received the very expression[fn-76-P7661_2194366:487-nf] of the exulting and triumphant challenge to the mortal foe.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_32_book_xix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"19","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"17. Corresponding to this change in words is the change which naturally took place in the substitution of new sacraments instead of those of the Old Testament. In the case of the first Christians, who came to the faith as Jews, it was by degrees that they were brought to change their customs, and to have a clear perception of the truth; and permission was given them by the apostle to preserve their hereditary worship and belief, in which they had been born and brought up; and those who had to do with them were required to make allowance for this reluctance to accept new customs. So the apostle circumcised Timothy, the son of a Jewish mother and a Greek father, when they went among people of this kind; and he himself accommodated his practice to theirs, not hypocritically, but for a wise purpose. For these practices were harmless in the case of those born and brought up in them, though they were no longer required to prefigure things to come. It would have done more harm to condemn them as hurtful in the case of those to whose time it was intended that they should continue. Christ, who came to fulfill all these prophecies, found those people trained in their own religion. But in the case of those who had no such training, but were brought to Christ, the corner-stone, from the opposite wall of circumcision, there was no obligation to adopt Jewish customs. If, indeed, like Timothy, they chose to accommodate themselves to the views of those of the circumcision who were still wedded to their old sacraments, they were free to do so. But if they supposed that their hope and salvation depended on these works of the law, they were warned against them as a fatal danger. So the apostle says: \"Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing;\"[fn-18-P1862_1049308:35-nf] that is, if they were circumcised, as they were intending to be, in compliance with some corrupt teachers, who told them that without these works of the law they could not be saved. For when, chiefly through the preaching of the Apostle Paul, the Gentiles were coming to the faith of Christ, as it was proper that they should come, without being burdened with Jewish observances-for those who were grown up were deterred from the faith by fear of ceremonies to which they were not accustomed, especially of circumcision; and if they who had not been trained from their birth to such observances had been made proselytes in the usual way, it would have implied that the coming of Christ still required to be predicted as a future event;-when, then, the Gentiles were admitted without these ceremonies, those of the circumcision who believed, not understanding why the Gentiles were not required to adopt their customs, nor why they themselves were still allowed to retain them, began to disturb the Church with carnal contentions. because the Gentiles were admitted into the people of God without being made proselytes in the usual way by circumcision and the other legal observances. Some also of the converted Gentiles were bent on these ceremonies, from fear of the Jews among whom they lived. Against these Gentiles the Apostle Paul often wrote, and when Peter was carried away by their hypocrisy, he corrected him with a brotherly rebuke.[fn-18-P1863_1050767:36-nf] Afterwards, when the apostles met in council, decreed that these works of the law were not obligatory in the case of the Gentiles,[fn-18-P1864_1050916:37-nf] some Christians of the circumcision were displeased, because they failed to understand that these observances were permissible only in those who had been trained in them before the revelation of faith, to bring to a close the prophetic life in those who were engaged in it before the prophecy was fulfilled, lest by a compulsory abandonment it should seem to be condemned rather than closed; while to lay these things on the Gentiles would imply either that they were not instituted to prefigure Christ, or that Christ was still to be prefigured. The ancient people of God, before Christ came to fulfill the law and the prophets, were required to observe all these things by which Christ was prefigured. It was freedom to those who understood the meaning of the observance, but it was bondage to those who did not. But the people in those latter times who come to believe in Christ as having already come, and suffered, and risen, in the case of those whom this faith found trained to those sacraments, are neither required to observe them, nor prohibited from doing so; while there is a prohibition in the case of those who were not bound by the ties of custom, or by any necessity, to accommodate themselves to the practice of others, so that it might become manifest that these things were instituted to prefigure Christ, and that after His coming they were to cease, because the promises had been fulfilled. Some believers of the circumcision who did not understand this were displeased with this tolerant arrangement which the Holy Spirit effected through the apostles, and stubbornly insisted on the Gentiles becoming Jews. These are the people of whom Faustus speaks under the name of Symmachians or Nazareans. Their number is now very small, but the sect still continues.","title":"Book XIX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_32_book_xix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"18. The Manichaeans, therefore have no ground for saying, in disparagement of the law and the prophets, that Christ crime to destroy rather than to fulfill them, because Christians do not observe what is there enjoined: for the only things which they do not observe are those that prefigured Christ, and these are not observed because their fulfillment is in Christ, and what is fulfilled is no longer prefigured; the typical observances having properly come to a close in the time of those who, after being trained in such things, had come to believe in Christ as their fulfillment. Do not Christians observe the precept of Scripture \"Hear, O Israel; the Lord thy God is one God;\" \"Thou shalt not image,\" and so on? Do make Christians not observe the precept, \"Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain?\" Do Christians not observe the Sabbath, even in the sense of a true rest? Do Christians not honor their parents, according to the commandment? Do Christians not abstain from fornication, and murder. and theft, and false witness, from coveting their neighbor's wife, and from coveting his property,-all of which things are written in the law? These moral precepts are distinct from typical sacraments: the former are fulfilled by the aid of divine grace, the latter by the accomplishment of what they promise. Both are fulfilled in Christ, who has ever been the bestower of this grace, which is also now revealed in Him, and who now makes manifest the accomplishment of what He in former times promised; for \"the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.\"[fn-18-P1866_1054316:38-nf] Again, these things which concern the keeping of a good conscience are fulfilled in the faith which worketh by love;[fn-18-P1867_1054450:39-nf] while types of the future pass away when they are accomplished. But even the types are not destroyed, but fulfilled; for Christ, in bringing to light what the types signified, does not prove them vain or illusory.19. Faustus, therefore, is wrong in supposing that the Lord Jesus fulfilled some precepts of righteous men who lived before the law of Moses, such as, \"Thou shall not kill,\" which Christ did not oppose, but rather confirmed by His prohibition of anger and abuse; and that He destroyed some things apparently peculiar to the Hebrew law, such as, \"An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,\" which Christ. seems rather to abolish than to confirm, when He says, \"But I say unto you, that ye resist not evil; but if any one smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also,\"[fn-18-P1868_1055260:40-nf] and so on.

But, to explain the point in hand: If Christ, in adding the words, \"But I say unto you,\" to the quotations He makes of ancient sayings, neither fulfilled the law of primitive times by His additions, nor destroyed the law given to Moses by opposite precepts, but rather paid such deference to the Hebrew law in all the quotations He made from it, as to make His own remarks chiefly explanatory of what the law stated less distinctly, or a means of securing the design intended by the law, it follows that from the words, \"I came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it\" we are not to understand that Christ by His precepts filled up what was wanting in the law; but that what the literal command failed in doing from the pride and disobedience of men, is accomplished by grace in those who are brought to repentance and humility. The fulfillment is not in additional words, but in acts of obedience.

I have said this, lest haply married fruitfulness dare to vie with virgin chastity, and to set forth Mary herself, and to say unto the virgins of God, She had in her flesh two things worthy of honor, virginity and fruitfulness; inasmuch as she both continued a virgin, and bore: this happiness, since we could not bothhave the whole, we have divided, that ye be virgins, we be mothers: for what is wanting to you in children, let your virginity, that hath been preserved, be a consolation: for us, let the gain of children make up for our lost virginity. This speech of faithful women married, unto holy virgins, would any how be to be endured, if they gave birth to Christians in the flesh; that in this alone, save virginity, the fruitfulness of Mary in the flesh should be more excellent, that she gave birth to the Head Himself of these members, but they to the members of That Head: but now, although by this speech there vie such as on this one account wed and have intercourse with husbands, that they may have sons, and have no other thought of their sons, than to gain them for Christ, and do this so soon as they can: yet are not Christians born of their flesh, but made so afterwards: the Church giving them birth, through this, that in a spiritual manner she is the mother of the members of Christ, of Whom also after a spiritual manner she is the virgin.

There is, again, an ambiguity arising out of the doubtful sound of syllables; and this of course has relation to pronunciation. For example, in the passage, \"My bone [os meum] was not hid from Thee, which Thou didst make in secret,\"[fn-50-P5074_2724446:17-nf] it is not clear to the reunder whether he should take the word os as short or long. If he make it short, it is the singular of ossa [bones]; if he make it long, it is the singular of ora [mouths]. Now difficulties such as this are cleared up by looking into the original tongue, for in the Greek we find not sto/ma [mouth], but o9ste/ [bone]. And for this reason the vulgar idiom is frequently more useful in conveying the sense than the pure speech of the educated. For I would rather have the barbarism, non est absconditum a te assure meum,[fn-50-P5075_2725084:18-nf] than have the passage in better Latin, but the sense less clear. But sometimes when the sound of a syllable is doubtful, it is decided by a word near it belonging to the same sentence. As, for example, that saying of the apostle, \"Of the which I tell you before [praedico], as I have also told you in time past [proedixi], that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-50-P5076_2725513:19-nf] Now if he had only said, \"Of the which I tell you before [quoe praedico vobis],\" and had not added, \"as I have also told you in time past [sicut proedixi],\" we could not know without going back to the original whether in the word praedico the middle syllable should be pronounced long or short.

Take, for example, that saying of the apostle: \"But, after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; who will render to every man according to his deeds: to them who, by patient continuance in well-doing, seek for glory, and honor, and immortality, eternal life; but unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile.\"[fn-51-P5113_2740498:29-nf] But this is addressed to those who, being unwilling to subdue their lust, are themselves involved in the destruction of their lust.

For since it is certainly a fact that there is a something in the soul which is properly called \"spirit,\" while (this being left out of question) it is also designated with equal propriety \"soul,\" our present contention is not about the things themselves;[fn-49-P4982_1970115:54-nf] mainly because I on my side certainly admit, and you on your part say the same, that that is properly called spirit by which we reason and understand, and yet that these things are distinguishingly designated, as the apostle says \"your whole spirit, and soul, and body.\" This spirit, however, the same apostle appears also to describe as mind; as when he says, \"So then with the mind I serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.\"[fn-49-P4983_1970976:55-nf] Now the meaning of this is precisely what he expresses in another passage thus: \"For the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh.\"[fn-49-P4984_1971153:56-nf] What he designates mind in the former place, he must be understood to call spirit in the latter passage. Not as you interpret the statement, \"The whole mind is meant, which consists of soul and spirit,\"-a view which I know not where you obtained.

For in many ways and in divers senses the Holy Scriptures make mention of the spirit; but with respect to that we are now speaking of, by which we exercise reason, intelligence, and wisdom, we are both agreed that it is called (and indeed rightly called) \"spirit,\" in such a sense as not to include the entire soul, but a part of it. If, however, you contend that the soul is not the spirit, on the ground that the understanding is distinctly called \"spirit,\" you may as well deny that the whole seed of Jacob is called Israel, since, apart from Judah, the same appellation was distinctly and separately borne by the ten tribes which were then organized in Samaria.

We, however, have received no aid from human instruction; nay, whatever graces of character are esteemed of good report by those who have understanding, are entirely the gift of God. And I am able to oppose no feeble buckler against the deadly weapons of Satan's armory; I mean the knowledge I possess of those things which are pleasing to him: and of these I will select such as are appropriate to my present design, while I proceed to sing the praises of the Father of all. But do thou, O Christ, Saviour of mankind, be present to aid me in my hallowed task! Direct the words which celebrate thy virtues,[fn-82-P8204_3369033:51-nf] and instruct me worthily to sound thy praises. And now, let no one expect to listen to the graces of elegant language: for well I know that the nerveless eloquence of those who speak to charm the ear, and whose aim is rather applause than sound argument, is distasteful to hearers of sound judgment. It is asserted, then, by some profane and senseless persons, that Christ, whom we worship, was justly condemned to death, and that he who is the author of life to all, was himself deprived of life. That such an assertion should be made by those who have once dared to enter the paths of impiety, who have cast aside all fear, and all thought of concealing their own depravity, is not surprising. But it is beyond the bounds of folly itself that they should be able, as it seems, really to persuade themselves that the incorruptible God yielded to the violence of men, and not rather to that love alone which he bore to the human race: that they should fail to perceive that divine magnanimity and forbearance is changed by no insult, is moved from its intrinsic steadfastness by no revilings; but is ever the same, breaking down and repelling, by the spirit of wisdom and greatness of soul, the savage fierceness of those who assail it. The gracious kindness of God had determined to abolish iniquity, and to exalt order and justice. Accordingly, he gathered a company of the wisest among men,[fn-82-P8205_3370471:52-nf] and ordained that most noble and useful doctrine, which is calculated to lead the good and blessed of mankind to an imitation of his own providential care. And what higher blessing can we speak of than this, that God should prescribe the way of righteousness, and make those who are counted worthy of his instruction like himself; that goodness might be communicated to all classes of mankind, and eternal felicity be the result? This is the glorious victory: this the true power: this the mighty work, worthy of its author, the restoration of all people to soundness of mind: and the glory of this triumph we joyfully ascribe to thee, thou Saviour of all! But thou, vile and wretched blasphemy, whose glory is in lies and rumors and calumny; thy power is to deceive and prevail with the inexperience of youth, and with men who still retain the folly of youth. These thou seducest from the service of the true God, and settest up false idols as the objects of their worship and their prayers; and thus the reward of their folly awaits thy deluded victims: for they calumniate Christ, the author of every blessing, who is God, and the Son of God. Is not the worship of the best and wisest of the nations of this world worthily directed to that God, who, while possessing boundless power, remains immovably true to his own purpose, and retains undiminished his characteristic kindness and love to man? Away, then, ye impious, for still ye may while vengeance on your transgressions is yet withheld; begone to your sacrifices, your feasts, your scenes of revelry and drunkenness, wherein, under the semblance of religion, your hearts are devoted to profligate enjoyment, and pretending to perform sacrifices, yourselves are the willing slaves of your own pleasures. No knowledge have ye of any good, nor even of the first commandment of the mighty God, who both declares his will to man, and gives commission to his Son to direct the course of human life, that they who have passed a career of virtue and self-control may obtain, according to the judgment of that Son, a second, yea, a blessed and happy existence.[fn-82-P8206_3373376:53-nf] I have now declared the decree of God respecting the life which he prescribes to man, neither ignorantly, as many have done, nor resting on the ground of opinion or conjecture. But it may be that some will ask, Whence this title of Son? Whence this generation of which we speak, if God be indeed only One, and incapable of union with another? We are, however, to consider generation as of two kinds; one in the way of natural birth, which is known to all; the other, that which is the effect of an eternal cause, the mode of which is seen by the prescience of God, and by those among men whom he loves. For he who is wise will recognize the cause which regulates the harmony of creation. Since, then, nothing exists without a cause, of necessity the cause of existing substances preceded their existence. But since the world and all things that it contains exist, and are preserved,[fn-82-P8207_3374419:54-nf] their preserver must have had a prior existence; so that Christ is the cause of preservation, and the preservation of things is an effect:[fn-82-P8208_3374939:55-nf] even as the Father is the cause of the Son, and the Son the effect of that cause. Enough, then, has been said to prove his priority of existence. But how do we explain his descent to this earth, and to men? His motive in this,[fn-82-P8209_3375839:56-nf] as the prophets had foretold, originated in his watchful care for the interests of all: for it needs must be that the Creator should care for his own works. But when the time came for him to assume a terrestrial body, and to sojourn on this earth, the need requiring, he devised for himself a new mode[fn-82-P8210_3376345:57-nf] of birth. Conception was there, yet apart from marriage: childbirth, yet pure virginity: and a maiden became the mother of God! An eternal nature received a beginning of temporal existence: a sensible form of a spiritual essence, a material manifestation of incorporeal brightness,[fn-82-P8211_3376855:58-nf] appeared. Alike wondrous were the circumstances which attended this great event. A radiant dove, like that which flew from the ark of Noah,[fn-82-P8212_3377081:59-nf] alighted on the Virgin's bosom: and accordant with this impalpable union, purer than chastity, more guileless than innocence itself, were the results which followed. From infancy possessing the wisdom of God, received with reverential awe by the Jordan, in whose waters he was baptized, gifted with that royal unction, the spirit of universal intelligence; with knowledge and power to perform miracles, and to heal diseases beyond the reach of human art; he yielded a swift and unhindered assent to the prayers of men, to whose welfare, indeed, his whole life was devoted without reserve. His doctrines instilled, not prudence only,[fn-82-P8213_3378708:60-nf] but real wisdom: his hearers were instructed, not in the mere social virtues,[fn-82-P8214_3379381:61-nf] but in the ways which conduct to the spiritual world; and devoted themselves to the contemplation of immutable and eternal things, and the knowledge of the Supreme Father. The benefits which he bestowed were no common blessings: for blindness, the gift of sight; for helpless weakness, the vigor of health; in the place of death, restoration to life again. I dwell not on that abundant provision in the wilderness, whereby a scanty measure of food became a complete and enduring supply[fn-82-P8215_3379968:62-nf] for the wants of a mighty multitude?[fn-82-P8216_3380200:63-nf] Thus do we render thanks to thee, our God and Saviour, according to our feeble power; unto thee, O Christ, supreme Providence of the mighty Father, who both savest us from evil, and impartest to us thy most blessed doctrine: for I say these things, not to praise, but to give thanks. For what mortal is he who shall worthily declare thy praise, of whom we learn that thou didst from nothing call creation into being, and illumine it with thy light; that thou didst regulate the confusion of the elements by the laws of harmony and order? But chiefly we mark thy loving-kindness,[fn-82-P8217_3380883:64-nf] in that thou hast caused those whose hearts inclined to thee to desire earnestly a divine and blessed life, and hast provided that, like merchants of true blessings, they might impart to many others the wisdom and good fortune they had received; themselves, meanwhile, reaping the everlasting fruit of virtue. Freed from the trammels of vice, and imbued with the love of their fellow-men, they keep mercy ever before their eyes, and hoping for the promises of faith;[fn-82-P8218_3381585:65-nf] devoted to modesty, and all those virtues which the past career of human life had thrown aside [but which were now restored by him whose providence is over all].[fn-82-P8219_3381782:66-nf] No other power could be found to devise a remedy for such evils, and for that spirit of injustice which had heretofore asserted its dominion over the race of men. Providence, however, could reach the circumstances even here, and with ease restored whatever had been disordered by violence and the licentiousness of human passion. And this restoring power he exercised without concealment. For he knew that, though there were some whose thoughts were able to recognize and understand his power, others there were whose brutish and senseless nature led them to rely exclusively on the testimony of their own senses.

We, however, have received no aid from human instruction; nay, whatever graces of character are esteemed of good report by those who have understanding, are entirely the gift of God. And I am able to oppose no feeble buckler against the deadly weapons of Satan's armory; I mean the knowledge I possess of those things which are pleasing to him: and of these I will select such as are appropriate to my present design, while I proceed to sing the praises of the Father of all. But do thou, O Christ, Saviour of mankind, be present to aid me in my hallowed task! Direct the words which celebrate thy virtues,[fn-82-P8204_3369033:51-nf] and instruct me worthily to sound thy praises. And now, let no one expect to listen to the graces of elegant language: for well I know that the nerveless eloquence of those who speak to charm the ear, and whose aim is rather applause than sound argument, is distasteful to hearers of sound judgment. It is asserted, then, by some profane and senseless persons, that Christ, whom we worship, was justly condemned to death, and that he who is the author of life to all, was himself deprived of life. That such an assertion should be made by those who have once dared to enter the paths of impiety, who have cast aside all fear, and all thought of concealing their own depravity, is not surprising. But it is beyond the bounds of folly itself that they should be able, as it seems, really to persuade themselves that the incorruptible God yielded to the violence of men, and not rather to that love alone which he bore to the human race: that they should fail to perceive that divine magnanimity and forbearance is changed by no insult, is moved from its intrinsic steadfastness by no revilings; but is ever the same, breaking down and repelling, by the spirit of wisdom and greatness of soul, the savage fierceness of those who assail it. The gracious kindness of God had determined to abolish iniquity, and to exalt order and justice. Accordingly, he gathered a company of the wisest among men,[fn-82-P8205_3370471:52-nf] and ordained that most noble and useful doctrine, which is calculated to lead the good and blessed of mankind to an imitation of his own providential care. And what higher blessing can we speak of than this, that God should prescribe the way of righteousness, and make those who are counted worthy of his instruction like himself; that goodness might be communicated to all classes of mankind, and eternal felicity be the result? This is the glorious victory: this the true power: this the mighty work, worthy of its author, the restoration of all people to soundness of mind: and the glory of this triumph we joyfully ascribe to thee, thou Saviour of all! But thou, vile and wretched blasphemy, whose glory is in lies and rumors and calumny; thy power is to deceive and prevail with the inexperience of youth, and with men who still retain the folly of youth. These thou seducest from the service of the true God, and settest up false idols as the objects of their worship and their prayers; and thus the reward of their folly awaits thy deluded victims: for they calumniate Christ, the author of every blessing, who is God, and the Son of God. Is not the worship of the best and wisest of the nations of this world worthily directed to that God, who, while possessing boundless power, remains immovably true to his own purpose, and retains undiminished his characteristic kindness and love to man? Away, then, ye impious, for still ye may while vengeance on your transgressions is yet withheld; begone to your sacrifices, your feasts, your scenes of revelry and drunkenness, wherein, under the semblance of religion, your hearts are devoted to profligate enjoyment, and pretending to perform sacrifices, yourselves are the willing slaves of your own pleasures. No knowledge have ye of any good, nor even of the first commandment of the mighty God, who both declares his will to man, and gives commission to his Son to direct the course of human life, that they who have passed a career of virtue and self-control may obtain, according to the judgment of that Son, a second, yea, a blessed and happy existence.[fn-82-P8206_3373376:53-nf] I have now declared the decree of God respecting the life which he prescribes to man, neither ignorantly, as many have done, nor resting on the ground of opinion or conjecture. But it may be that some will ask, Whence this title of Son? Whence this generation of which we speak, if God be indeed only One, and incapable of union with another? We are, however, to consider generation as of two kinds; one in the way of natural birth, which is known to all; the other, that which is the effect of an eternal cause, the mode of which is seen by the prescience of God, and by those among men whom he loves. For he who is wise will recognize the cause which regulates the harmony of creation. Since, then, nothing exists without a cause, of necessity the cause of existing substances preceded their existence. But since the world and all things that it contains exist, and are preserved,[fn-82-P8207_3374419:54-nf] their preserver must have had a prior existence; so that Christ is the cause of preservation, and the preservation of things is an effect:[fn-82-P8208_3374939:55-nf] even as the Father is the cause of the Son, and the Son the effect of that cause. Enough, then, has been said to prove his priority of existence. But how do we explain his descent to this earth, and to men? His motive in this,[fn-82-P8209_3375839:56-nf] as the prophets had foretold, originated in his watchful care for the interests of all: for it needs must be that the Creator should care for his own works. But when the time came for him to assume a terrestrial body, and to sojourn on this earth, the need requiring, he devised for himself a new mode[fn-82-P8210_3376345:57-nf] of birth. Conception was there, yet apart from marriage: childbirth, yet pure virginity: and a maiden became the mother of God! An eternal nature received a beginning of temporal existence: a sensible form of a spiritual essence, a material manifestation of incorporeal brightness,[fn-82-P8211_3376855:58-nf] appeared. Alike wondrous were the circumstances which attended this great event. A radiant dove, like that which flew from the ark of Noah,[fn-82-P8212_3377081:59-nf] alighted on the Virgin's bosom: and accordant with this impalpable union, purer than chastity, more guileless than innocence itself, were the results which followed. From infancy possessing the wisdom of God, received with reverential awe by the Jordan, in whose waters he was baptized, gifted with that royal unction, the spirit of universal intelligence; with knowledge and power to perform miracles, and to heal diseases beyond the reach of human art; he yielded a swift and unhindered assent to the prayers of men, to whose welfare, indeed, his whole life was devoted without reserve. His doctrines instilled, not prudence only,[fn-82-P8213_3378708:60-nf] but real wisdom: his hearers were instructed, not in the mere social virtues,[fn-82-P8214_3379381:61-nf] but in the ways which conduct to the spiritual world; and devoted themselves to the contemplation of immutable and eternal things, and the knowledge of the Supreme Father. The benefits which he bestowed were no common blessings: for blindness, the gift of sight; for helpless weakness, the vigor of health; in the place of death, restoration to life again. I dwell not on that abundant provision in the wilderness, whereby a scanty measure of food became a complete and enduring supply[fn-82-P8215_3379968:62-nf] for the wants of a mighty multitude?[fn-82-P8216_3380200:63-nf] Thus do we render thanks to thee, our God and Saviour, according to our feeble power; unto thee, O Christ, supreme Providence of the mighty Father, who both savest us from evil, and impartest to us thy most blessed doctrine: for I say these things, not to praise, but to give thanks. For what mortal is he who shall worthily declare thy praise, of whom we learn that thou didst from nothing call creation into being, and illumine it with thy light; that thou didst regulate the confusion of the elements by the laws of harmony and order? But chiefly we mark thy loving-kindness,[fn-82-P8217_3380883:64-nf] in that thou hast caused those whose hearts inclined to thee to desire earnestly a divine and blessed life, and hast provided that, like merchants of true blessings, they might impart to many others the wisdom and good fortune they had received; themselves, meanwhile, reaping the everlasting fruit of virtue. Freed from the trammels of vice, and imbued with the love of their fellow-men, they keep mercy ever before their eyes, and hoping for the promises of faith;[fn-82-P8218_3381585:65-nf] devoted to modesty, and all those virtues which the past career of human life had thrown aside [but which were now restored by him whose providence is over all].[fn-82-P8219_3381782:66-nf] No other power could be found to devise a remedy for such evils, and for that spirit of injustice which had heretofore asserted its dominion over the race of men. Providence, however, could reach the circumstances even here, and with ease restored whatever had been disordered by violence and the licentiousness of human passion. And this restoring power he exercised without concealment. For he knew that, though there were some whose thoughts were able to recognize and understand his power, others there were whose brutish and senseless nature led them to rely exclusively on the testimony of their own senses. In open day, therefore, that no one, whether good or evil, might find room for doubt, he manifested his blessed and wondrous healing power; restoring the dead to life again, and renewing with a word the powers of those who had been bereft of bodily sense.[fn-82-P8220_3382826:67-nf] Can we, in short, suppose, that to render the sea firm as the solid ground, to still the raging of the storm, and finally to ascend to heaven, after turning the unbelief of men to steadfast faith by the performance of these wondrous acts, demanded less than almighty power, was less than the work of God?

For this reason, from the books of the New Testament, except the figurative pre-significations used by our Lord, if thou consider the life and manners of the Saints, their actions and sayings, nothing of the kind can be produced which should provoke to imitation of lying. For the simulation of Peter and Barnabas is not only recorded, but also reproved and corrected.[fn-42-P4269_2032239:9-nf] For it was not, as some suppose,[fn-42-P4270_2032292:10-nf] out of the same simulation that even Paul the Apostle either circumcised Timothy, or himself celebrated certain ceremonies[fn-42-P4271_2032468:11-nf] according to the Jewish rite; but he did so, out of that liberty of his mind whereby he preached that neither are the Gentiles the better for circumcision, nor the Jews the worse. Wherefore he judged that neither the former should be tied to the custom of the Jews, nor the Jews deterred from the custom of their fathers. Whence are those words of his: \"Is any man called being circumcised let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised. Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God. Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.\"[fn-42-P4272_2033135:12-nf] How can a man become uncircumcised after circumcision? but let him not do so, saith he: let him not so live as if he had become uncircumcised, that is, as if he had covered again with flesh the part that was bared, and ceased to be a Jew; as in another place he saith, \"Thy circumcision is become uncircumcision.\"[fn-42-P4273_2033473:13-nf] And this the Apostle said, not as though he would compel either those to remain in uncircumcision, or the Jews in the custom of their fathers: but that neither these nor those should be forced to the other custom; and, each should have power of abiding in his own custom, not necessity of so doing. For neither if the Jew should wish, where it would disturb no man, to recede from Jewish observances, would he be prohibited by the Apostle, since the object of his counselling to abide therein was that Jews might not by being troubled about superfluous things be hindered from coming to those things which are necessary to salvation. Neither would it be prohibited by him, if any of the Gentiles should wish to be circumcised for the purpose of showing that he does not detest the same as noxious, but holds it indifferently, as a seal,[fn-42-P4274_2034328:14-nf] the usefulness of which had already passed away with time; for it did not follow that, if there were now no salvation to be had from it, there was destruction to be dreaded therefrom. And for this reason, Timothy, having been called in uncircumcision, yet because his mother was a Jewess and he was bound, in order to gain his kindred, to show them that he had not learnt in the Christian discipline to abominate the sacraments of the old Law, was circumcised by the Apostle;[fn-42-P4275_2034822:15-nf] that in this way i they might prove to the Jews, that the reason why the Gentiles do not receive them, is notthat they are evil and were perniciously observed by the Fathers, but because they are no longer necessary to salvation after the advent of that so great Sacrament. which through so long times the whole of that ancient Scripture in its prophetical prefigurations did travail in birth withal. For he would circumcise Titus also, when the Jews urged this,[fn-42-P4276_2035305:16-nf] but that false brethren, privily brought in, wished it to be done to the intent they might have it to disseminate concerning Paul himself as a token that he had given place to the truth of their preaching, who said that the hope of Gospel salvation is in circumcision of the flesh and observances of that kind, and that without these Christ profiteth no man: whereas on the contrary Christ would nothing profit them, who should be circumcised because they thought that in it was salvation; whence that saying, \"Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.[fn-42-P4277_2035925:17-nf] Out of this liberty, therefore, did Paul keep the observances of his fathers, but with this one precaution and express declaration, that people should not suppose that without these was no Christian salvation. Peter, however, by his making as though salvation consisted in Judaism, was compelling the Gentiles to judaize; as is shown by Paul's words, where he says, \"Why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?[fn-42-P4278_2036365:18-nf] For they would be under no compulsion unless they saw that he observed them in such manner as if beside them could be no salvation. Peter's simulation therefore is not to be compared to Paul's liberty. And while we ought to love Peter for that he willingly received correction, we must not bolster up lying even by the authority of Paul, who both recalled Peter to the right path in the presence of them all, lest the Gentiles through him should be compelled to judaize; and bare witness to his own preaching, that whereas he was accounted hostile to the traditions of the fathers in that he would not impose them on the Gentiles, he did not despise to celebrate them himself according to the custom of his fathers, and therein sufficiently showed that this has remained in them at the Coming of Christ; that neither to the Jews they are pernicious, nor to the Gentiles necessary, nor henceforth to any of mankind means of salvation.[fn-42-P4279_2037318:19-nf] ","title":"On Lying.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_20_sermon_iii_liii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"11. Our faith then must be different from the faith of devils. For our faith purifies the heart; but their faith makes them guilty. For they do wickedly, and therefore say they to the Lord, \"What have we to do with Thee?\" When thou hearest the devils say this, thinkest thou that they do not acknowledge Him? \"We know,\" they say, \"who Thou art: Thou art the Son of God.\"[fn-32-P3201_1405998:32-nf] This Peter says, and is commended; the devil says it, and is condemned. Whence cometh this, but that though the words be the same, the heart is different? Let us then make a distinction in our faith, and not be content to believe. This is no such faith as purifieth the heart. \"Purifying their hearts,\" it is said, \"by faith.\"[fn-32-P3202_1406358:33-nf] But by what, and what kind of faith, save that which the Apostle Paul defines when he says, \"Faith which worketh by love.\"[fn-32-P3203_1406498:34-nf] That faith distinguishes us from the faith of devils, and from the infamous and abandoned conduct of men. \"Faith,\" he says. What faith? \"That which worketh by love,\" and which hopeth for what God doth promise. Nothing is more exact or perfect than this definition. There are then in faith these three things. He in whom that faith is which worketh by love, must necessarily hope for that which God doth promise. Hope therefore is the associate of faith. For hope is necessary as long as we see not what we believe, lest perhaps through not seeing, and by despairing to see, we fail. That we see not, doth make us sad; but that we hope we shall see, comforteth us. Hope than is here, and she is the associate of faith. And then charity also, by which we long, and strive to attain, and glow with desire, and hunger and thirst. This then is taken in also; and so there will be faith, hope, and charity. For how shall there not be charity there, since charity is nothing else but love? And this faith is itself defined as that \"which worketh by love.\" Take away faith, and all thou believest perisheth; take away charity, and all that thou dost perisheth. For it is the province of faith to believe, of charity to do. For if thou believest without love, thou dost not apply thyself to good works; or if thou dost, it is as a servant, not as a son, through fear of punishment, not through love of righteousness. Therefore Isay, that faith purifieth the heart, which worketh by love.","title":"Sermon III. [LIII.

The master of a private dwelling will not allow any untidiness or unseemliness to be seen in the house, such as a couch upset, or the table littered with rubbish, or vessels of price thrown away into dirty corners, while those which serve ignobler uses are thrust forward for entering guests to see. He has everything arranged neatly and in the proper place, where it stands to most advantage; and then he can welcome his guests, without any misgivings that he need be ashamed of opening the interior of his house to receive them. The same duty, I take it, is incumbent on that master of our \"tabernacle,\" the mind; it has to arrange everything within us, and to put each particular faculty of the soul, which the Creator has fashioned to be our implement or our vessel, to fitting and noble uses. We will now mention in detail the way in which any one might manage his life, with its present advantages, to his improvement, hoping that no one will accuse us of trifling[fn-28-P2818_1909802:117-nf] , or over-minuteness. We advise, then, that love's passion be placed in the soul's purest shrine, as a thing chosen to be the first fruits of all our gifts, and devoted[fn-28-P2819_1910017:118-nf] entirely to God; and when once this has been done, to keep it untouched and unsullied by any secular defilement. Then indignation, and anger, and hatred must be as watch-dogs to be roused only against attacking sins; they must follow their natural impulse only against the thief and the enemy who is creeping in to plunder the divine treasure-chamber, and who comes only for that, that he may steal, and mangle, and destroy. Courage and confidence are to be weapons in our hands to baffle any sudden surprise and attack of the wicked who advance. Hope and patience are to be the staffs to lean upon, whenever we are weary with the trials of the world. As for sorrow, we must have a stock of it ready to apply, if need should happen to arise for it, in the hour of repentance for our sins; believing at the same time that it is never useful, except to minister to that. Righteousness will be our rule of straightforwardness, guarding us from stumbling either in word or deed, and guiding us in the disposal of the faculties of our soul, as well as in the due consideration for every one we meet. The love of gain, which is a large, incalculably large, element in every soul, when once applied to the desire for God, will bless the man who has it; for he will be violent[fn-28-P2820_1911376:119-nf] where it is right to be violent. Wisdom and prudence will be our advisers as to our best interests; they will order our lives so as never to suffer from any thoughtless folly. But suppose a man does not apply the aforesaid faculties of the soul to their proper use, but reverses their intended purpose; suppose he wastes his love upon the basest objects, and stores up his hatred only for his own kinsmen; suppose he welcomes iniquity, plays the man only against his parents, is bold only in absurdities, fixes his hopes on emptiness, chases prudence and wisdom from his company, takes gluttony and folly for his mistresses, and uses all his other opportunities in the same fashion, he would indeed be a strange and unnatural character to a degree beyond any one's power to express. If we could imagine any one putting his armour on all the wrong way, reversing the helmet so as to cover his face while the plume nodded backward, putting his feet into the cuirass, and fitting the greaves on to his breast, changing to the right side all that ought to go on the left and vice versa, and how such a hoplite would be likely to fare in battle, then we should have an idea of the fate in life which is sure to await him whose confused judgment makes him reverse the proper uses of his soul's faculties. We must therefore provide this balance in all feeling; the true sobriety of mind is naturally able to supply it; and if one had to find an exact definition of this sobriety, one might declare absolutely, that it amounts to our ordered control, by dint of wisdom and prudence, over every emotion of the soul. Moreover, such a condition in the soul will be no longer in need of any laborious method to attain to the high and heavenly realities; it will accomplish with the greatest ease that which erewhile seemed so unattainable; it will grasp the object of its search as a natural consequence of rejecting the opposite attractions. A man who comes out of darkness is necessarily in the light; a man who is not dead is necessarily alive. Indeed, if a man is not to have received his soul to no purpose[fn-28-P2821_1913528:120-nf] , he will certainly be upon the path of truth; the prudence and the science employed to guard against error will be itself a sure guidance along the right road. Slaves who have been freed and cease to serve their former masters, the very moment they become their own masters, direct all their thoughts towards themselves so, I take it, the soul which has been freed from ministering to the body becomes at once cognizant of its own inherent energy. But this liberty consists, as we learn from the Apostle[fn-28-P2822_1914149:121-nf] , in not again being held in the yoke of slavery, and in not being bound again, like a runaway or a criminal, with the fetters of marriage. But I must return here to what I said at first; that the perfection of this liberty does not consist only in that one point of abstaining from marriage. Let no one suppose that the prize of virginity is so insignificant and so easily won as that; as if one little observance of the flesh could settle so vital a matter. But we have seen that every man who doeth a sin is the servant of sin[fn-28-P2823_1914697:122-nf] ; so that a declension towards vice in any act, or in any practice whatever, makes a slave, and still more, a branded slave, of the man, covering him through sin's lashes with bruises and seared spots. Therefore it behoves the man who grasps at the transcendent aim of all virginity to be true to himself in h every respect, and to manifest his purity equally in every relation of his life. If any of the inspired words are required to aid our pleading, the Truth[fn-28-P2824_1915186:123-nf] Itself will be sufficient to corroborate the truth when It inculcates this very kind of teaching in the veiled meaning of a Gospel Parable: the good and eatable fish are separated by the fishers' skill from the bad and poisonous fish, so that the enjoyment of the good should not be spoilt by any of the bad getting into the \"vessels\" with them. The work of true sobriety is the same; from all pursuits and habits to choose that which is pure and improving, rejecting in every case that which does not seem likely to be useful, and letting it go back into the universal and secular life, called \"the sea[fn-28-P2825_1915813:124-nf] ,\" in the imagery of the Parable. The Psalmist[fn-28-P2826_1915902:125-nf] also, when expounding the doctrine of a full confession[fn-28-P2827_1915978:126-nf] , calls this restless suffering tumultuous life, \"waters coming in even unto the soul,\" \"depths of waters,\" and a \"hurricane\"; in which sea indeed every rebellious thought sinks, as the Egyptian did, with a stone's weight into the deeps[fn-28-P2828_1916261:127-nf] . But all in us that is dear to God, and has a piercing insight into the truth (called \"Israel\" in the narrative), passes, but that alone, over that sea as if it were dry land, and is never reached by the bitterness and the brine of life's billows. Thus, typically, under the leadership of the Law (for Moses was a type of the Law that was coming) Israel passes unwetted over that sea, while the Egyptian who crosses in her track is overwhelmed. Each fares according to the disposition which he carries with him; one walks lightly enough, the other is dragged into the deep water. For virtue is a light and buoyant thing, and all who live in her way \"fly like clouds[fn-28-P2829_1916948:128-nf] ,\" as Isaiah says, \"and as doves with their young ones\"; but sin is a heavy affair, \"sitting,\" as another of the prophets says, \"upon a talent of lead[fn-28-P2830_1917155:129-nf] .\" If, however, this reading of the history appears to any forced and inapplicable, and the miracle at the Red Sea does not present itself to him as written for our profit, let him listen to the Apostle: \"Now all these things happened unto them for types, and they are written for our admonition[fn-28-P2831_1917684:130-nf] .\"","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_31_on_virginity","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"80","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":" It would therefore be to their profit, for the young to refrain from laying down[fn-28-P2897_1945236:176-nf] for themselves their future course in this profession; and indeed, examples of holy lives for them to follow are not wanting in the living generation[fn-28-P2898_1945457:177-nf] . Now, if ever before, saintliness abounds and penetrates our world; by gradual advances it has reached the highest mark of perfectness; and one who follows such footsteps in his daily rounds may catch this halo; one who tracks the scent of this preceding perfume may be drenched in the sweet odours of Christ Himself. As, when one torch has been fired, flame is transmitted to all the neighbouring candlesticks, without either the first light being lessened or blazing with unequal brilliance on the other points where it has been caught; so the saintliness of a life is transmitted from him who has achieved it, to those who come within his circle; for there is truth in the Prophet's saying[fn-28-P2899_1946733:178-nf] , that one who lives with a man who is \"holy\" and \"clean\" and \"elect,\" will become such himself. If you would wish to know the sure signs, which will secure you the real model, it is not hard to take a sketch from life. If you see a man so standing between death and life, as to select from each helps for the contemplative course, never letting death's stupor paralyze his zeal to keep all the commandments, nor yet placing both feet in the world of the living, since he has weaned himself from secular ambitions;-a man who remains more insensate than the dead themselves to everything that is found on examination to be living for the flesh, but instinct with life and energy and strength in the achievements of virtue, which are the sure marks of the spiritual life;-then look to that man for the rule of your life; let him be the leading light of your course of devotion, as the constellations that never set are to the pilot; imitate his youth and his gray hairs: or, rather, imitate the old man and the stripling who are joined in him; for even now in his declining years time has not blunted the keen activity of his soul, nor was his youth active in the sphere of youth's well-known employments; in both seasons of life he has shown a wonderful combination of opposites, or rather an exchange of the peculiar qualities of each; for in age he shows, in the direction of the good, a young man's energy, while, in the hours of youth, in the direction of evil, his passions were powerless. If you wish to know what were the passions of that glorious youth of his, you will have for your imitation the intensity and glow of his godlike love of wisdom, which grew with him from his childhood, and has continued with him into his old age. But if you cannot gaze upon him, as the weak-sighted cannot gaze upon the sun, at all events watch that band of holy men who are ranged beneath him, and who by the illumination of their lives are a model for this age. God has placed them as a beacon for us who live around; many among them have been young men there in their prime, and have grown gray in the unbroken practice of continence and temperance; they were old in reasonableness before their time, and in character outstripped their years. The only love they tasted was that of wisdom; not that their natural instincts were different from the rest; for in all alike \"the flesh lusteth against the spirit[fn-29-P2900_1949181:179-nf] ;\" but they listened to some purpose to him who said that Temperance \"is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her[fn-29-P2901_1949319:180-nf] ;\" and they sailed across the swelling billows of existence upon this tree of life, as upon a skiff; and anchored in the haven of the will of God; enviable now after so fair a voyage, they rest their souls in that sunny cloudless calm. They now ride safe themselves at the anchor of a good hope, far out of reach of the tumult of the billows; and for others who will follow they radiate the splendour of their lives as beacon-fires on some high watch-tower. We have indeed a mark to guide us safely over the ocean of temptations; and why make the too curious inquiry, whether some with such thoughts as these have not fallen nevertheless, and why therefore despair, as if the achievement was beyond your reach? Look on him who has succeeded, and boldly launch upon the voyage with confidence that it will be prosperous, and sail on under the breeze of the Holy Spirit with Christ your pilot and with the oarage of good cheer[fn-29-P2902_1950286:181-nf] . For those who \"go down to the sea in ships and occupy their business in great waters\" do not let the shipwreck that has befallen some one else prevent their being of good cheer; they rather shield their hearts in this very, confidence, and so sweep on to accomplish their successful feat. Surely it is the most absurd thing in the world to reprobate him who has slipped in a course which requires the greatest nicety, while one considers those who all their lives have been growing old in failures and in errors, to have chosen the better part. If one single approach to sin is such an awful thing that you deem it safer not to take in hand at all this loftier aim, how much more awful a thing it is to make sin the practice of a whole life, and to remain thereby absolutely ignorant of the purer course! How can you in your full life obey the Crucified? How can you, hale in sin, obey Him Who died to sin? How can you, who are not crucified to the world, and will not accept the mortification of the flesh, obey Him Who bids you follow after Him, and Who bore the Cross in His own body, as a trophy from the foe? How can you obey Paul when he exhorts you \"to present your body a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God[fn-29-P2903_1951546:182-nf] ,\" when you are \"conformed to this world,\" and not transformed by the renewing of your mind, when you are not \"walking\" in this \"newness of life,\" but still pursuing the routine of \"the old man\"? How can you be a priest unto God[fn-29-P2904_1951820:183-nf] , anointed though you are for this very office, to offer a gift to God; a gift in no way another's, no counterfeited gift from sources outside yourself, but a gift that is really your own, namely, \"the inner man[fn-29-P2905_1952128:184-nf] ,\" who must be perfect and blameless, as it is required of a lamb to be without spot or blemish? How can you offer this to God, when you do not listen to the law forbidding the unclean to offer sacrifices? If you long for God to manifest Himself to you, why do you not hear Moses, when he commands the people to be pure from the stains of marriage, that they may take in the vision of God[fn-29-P2906_1952539:185-nf] If this all seems little in your eyes, to be crucified with Christ, to present yourself a sacrifice to God, to become a priest unto the most high God, to make yourself worthy of the vision of the Almighty, what higher blessings than these can we imagine for you, if indeed you make light of the consequences of these as well? And the consequence of being crucified with Christ is that we shall live with Him, and be glorified with Him, and reign with Him; and the consequence of presenting ourselves to God is that we shall be changed from the rank of human nature and human dignity to that of Angels; for so speaks Daniel, that \"thousand thousands stood before him[fn-29-P2907_1953227:186-nf] .\" He too who has taken his share in the true priesthood and placed himself beside the Great High Priest remains altogether himself a priest for ever, prevented for eternity from remaining any more in death. To say, again, that one makes oneself worthy to see God, produces no less a result than this; that one is made worthy to see God. Indeed, the crown of every hope, and of every desire, of every blessing, and of every promise of God, and of all those unspeakable delights which we believe to exist beyond our perception and our knowledge,-the crowning result of them all, I say, is this. Moses longed earnestly to see it, and many prophets and kings have desired to see the same: but the only class deemed worthy of it are the pure in heart, those who are, and are named \"blessed,\" for this very reason, that \"they shall see God[fn-29-P2908_1954083:187-nf] .\" Wherefore we would that you too should become crucified with Christ, a holy priest standing before God, a pure offering in all chastity, preparing yourself by your own holiness for God's coming; that you also may have a pure heart in which to see God, according to the promise of God, and of our Saviour Jesus Christ, to Whom be gloryfor ever and ever. Amen.

And yet it is to it we may rightly understand the words of the apostle to be applicable, \"what is the breadth, and the length,and the height, and the depth.\"[fn-37-P3763_2072249:12-nf] For its breadth lies in the transverse beam, on which the hands of the Crucified are extended; and signifies good works in all the breadth of love: its length extends from the transverse beam to the ground, and is that whereto the back and feet are affixed; and signifies perseverance through the whole length of time to the end: its height is in the summit, which rises upwards above the transverse beam; and signifies the supernal goal, to which all works have reference, since all things that are done well and perseveringly, in respect of their breadth and length, are to be done also with due regard to the exalted character of the divine rewards: its depth is found in the part that is fixed into the ground; for there it is both concealed and invisible, and yet from thence spring up all those parts that are outstanding and evident to the senses; just as all that is good in us proceeds from the depths of the grace of God, which is beyond the reach of human comprehension and judgment.

And yet it does not this, unless the good spirit be lusting against the flesh, seeing that it was the opposing, or, in other words, the evil spirit that constructed the cross of Christ. And lastly, as every one knows, what else is the sign of Christ but the cross of Christ? For unless that sign be applied, whether it be to the foreheads of believers, or to the very water out of which they are regenerated, or to the oil with which they receive the anointing chrism, or to the sacrifice that nourishes them, none of them is properly administered.

In so many words[fn-98-P9899_2734914:151-nf] he says: \"Since ye are risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.\"[fn-99-P9900_2735119:152-nf] Accordingly, it is in our mind that he shows that we rise (with Christ), since it is by this alone that we are as yet able to reach to heavenly objects. These we should not \"seek,\" nor \"set our affection on,\" if we had them already in our possession. He also adds: \"For ye are dead\"-to your sins, he means, not to yourselves-\"and your life is hid with Christ in God.\"[fn-99-P9901_2735510:153-nf] Now that life is not yet apprehended which is hidden. In like manner John says: \"And it doth not yet appear what we shall be: we know, however, that when He shall be manifest, we shall be like Him.\"[fn-99-P9902_2735725:154-nf] We are far indeed from being already what we know not of; we should, of course, be sure to know it if we were already (like Him). It is therefore the contemplation of our blessed hope even in this life by faith (that he speaks of)-not its presence nor its possession, but only its expectation. Concerning this expectation and hope Paul writes to the Galatians: \"For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.\"[fn-99-P9903_2736181:155-nf] He says \"we wait for it,\" not we are in possession of it. By the righteousness of God, he means that judgment which we shall have to undergo as the recompense of our deeds. It is in expectation of this for himself that the apostle writes to the Philippians: \"If by any means,\" says he, \"I might attain to the resurrection of the dead. Not as though I had already attained, or were already perfect.\"[fn-99-P9904_2736598:156-nf] And yet he had believed, and had known all mysteries, as an elect vessel and the great teacher of the Gentiles; but for all that he goes on to say: \"I, however, follow on, if so be I may apprehend that for which I also am apprehended of Christ.\"[fn-99-P9905_2736870:157-nf] Nay, more: \"Brethren,\" (he adds), \"I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing (I do), forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of blamelessness,[fn-99-P9906_2737141:158-nf] whereby I may attain it; \"meaning the resurrection from the dead in its proper time.

Now, if you follow the order of the substances, the soul cannot be the new man because it comes the later of the two; nor can the flesh be the old man because it is the former. For what fraction of time was it that intervened between the creative hand of God and His afflatus? I will venture to say, that even if the soul was a good deal prior to the flesh, by the very circumstance that the soul had to wait to be itself completed, it made the other[fn-101-P10112_2818555:298-nf] really the former. For everything which gives the finishing stroke and perfection to a work, although it is subsequent in its mere order, yet has the priority in its effect. Much more is that prior, without which preceding things could have no existence. If the flesh be the old man, when did it become so? From the beginning? But Adam was wholly a new man, and of that new man there could be no part an old man. And from that time, ever since the blessing which was pronounced upon man's generation,[fn-101-P10113_2819074:299-nf] the flesh and the soul have had a simultaneous birth, without any calculable difference in time; so that the two have been even generated together in the womb, as we have shown in our Treatise on the Soul.[fn-101-P10114_2819299:300-nf] Contemporaneous in the womb, they are also temporally identical in their birth. The two are no doubt produced by human parents[fn-101-P10115_2819448:301-nf] of two substances, but not at two different periods; rather they are so entirely one, that neither is before the other in point of time. It is more correct (to say), that we are either entirely the old man or entirely the new, for we cannot tell how we can possibly be anything else. But the apostle mentions a very clear mark of the old man. For \"put off,\" says he, \"concerning the former conversation, the old man; \"[fn-101-P10116_2819924:302-nf] (he does) not say concerning the seniority of either substance. It is not indeed the flesh which he bids us to put off, but the works which he in another passage shows to be \"works of the flesh.\"[fn-101-P10117_2820140:303-nf] He brings no accusation against men's bodies, of which he even writes as follows: \"Putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbor: for we are members one of another. Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: neither give place to the devil. Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands (the thing which is good), that he may have to give to him that needeth. Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good for the edification of faith, that it may minister grace unto the hearers. And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil-speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: but be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ hath forgiven you.\"[fn-101-P10118_2821063:304-nf] Why, therefore, do not those who suppose the flesh to be the old man, hasten their own death, in order that by laying aside the old man they may satisfy the apostle's precepts? As for ourselves, we believe that the whole of faith is to be administered in the flesh, nay more, by the flesh, which has both a mouth for the utterance of all holy words, and a tongue to refrain from blasphemy, and a heart to avoid all irritation, and hands to labour and to give; while we also maintain that as well the old man as the new has relation to the difference of moral conduct, and not to any discrepancy of nature. And just as we acknowledge that that which according to its former conversation was \"the old man\" was also corrupt, and received its very name in accordance with \"its deceitful lusts,\" so also (do we hold) that it is \"the old man in reference to its former conversation,\"[fn-101-P10119_2821964:305-nf] and not in respect of the flesh through any permanent dissolution. Moreover, it is still unimpaired in the flesh, and identical in that nature, even when it has become \"the new man; \"since it is of its sinful course of life, and not of its corporeal substance, that it has been divested.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":21,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":51,"source_paragraph":"165","folder":"ANF-03","text":"We come now to the very gist[fn-101-P10181_2839825:355-nf] of the whole question: What are the substances, and of what nature are they, which the apostle has disinherited of the kingdom of God? The preceding statements give us a clue to this point also. He says: \"The first man is of the earth, earthy\"-that is, made of dust, that is, Adam; \"the second man is from heaven\"[fn-101-P10182_2840177:356-nf] -that is, the Word of God, which is Christ, in no other way, however, man (although \"from heaven \"), than as being Himself flesh and soul, just as a human being is, just as Adam was. Indeed, in a previous passage He is called \"the second Adam, \"[fn-101-P10183_2840445:357-nf] deriving the identity of His name from His participation in the substance, because not even Adam was flesh of human seed, in which Christ is also like Him.[fn-101-P10184_2840617:358-nf] \"As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.\"[fn-101-P10185_2840773:359-nf] Such (does he mean), in substance; or first of all in training, and afterwards in the dignity and worth which that training aimed at acquiring? Not in substance, however, by any means will the earthy and the heavenly be separated, designated as they have been by the apostle once for all, as men. For even if Christ were the only true \"heavenly,\" nay, super-celestial Being, He is still man, as composed of body and soul; and in no respect is He separated from the quality of \"earthiness,\" owing to that condition of His which makes Him a partaker of both substances. In like manner, those also who after Him are heavenly, are understood to have this celestial quality predicated of them not from their present nature, but from their future glory; because in a preceding sentence, which originated this distinction respecting difference of dignity, there was shown to be \"one glory in celestial bodies, and another in terrestrial ones,\"[fn-101-P10186_2841732:360-nf] -\"one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for even one star differeth from another star in glory, \"[fn-101-P10187_2841899:361-nf] although not in substance. Then, after having thus premised the difference in that worth or dignity which is even now to be aimed at, and then at last to be enjoyed, the apostle adds an exhortation, that we should both here in our training follow the example of Christ, and there attain His eminence in glory: \"As we have borne the image of the earthy, let us also bear the image of the heavenly.\"[fn-101-P10188_2842313:362-nf] We have indeed borne the image of the earthy, by our sharing in his transgression, by our participation in his death, by our banishment from Paradise. Now, although the image of Adam is here borne by is in the flesh, yet we are not exhorted to put off the flesh; but if not the flesh, it is the conversation, in order that we may then bear the image of the heavenly in ourselves,-no longer indeed the image of God, and no longer the image of a Being whose state is in heaven; but after the lineaments of Christ, by our walking here in holiness, righteousness, and truth. And so wholly intent on the inculcation of moral conduct is he throughout. this passage, that he tells us we ought to bear the image of Christ in this flesh of ours, and in this period of instruction and discipline. For when he says \"let us bear\" in the imperative mood, he suits his words to the present life, in which man exists in no other substance than as flesh and soul; or if it is another, even the heavenly, substance to which this faith (of ours) looks forward, yet the promise is made to that substance to which the injunction is given to labour earnestly to merit its reward. Since, therefore, he makes the image both of the earthy and the heavenly consist of moral conduct-the one to be abjured, and the other to be pursued-and then consistently adds, \"For this I say\" (on account, that is, of what I have already said, because the conjunction \"for\" connects what follows with the preceding words) \"that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God,\"[fn-101-P10189_2843870:363-nf] -he means the flesh and blood to be understood in no other sense than the before-mentioned \"image of the earthy; \"and since this is reckoned to consist in \"the old conversation,\"[fn-101-P10190_2844071:364-nf] which old conversation receives not the kingdom of God, therefore flesh and blood, by not receiving the kingdom of God, are reduced to the life of the old conversation. Of course, as the apostle has never put the substance for the works of man, he cannot use such a construction here. Since, however he has declared of men which are yet alive in the flesh, that they \"are not in the flesh,\"[fn-101-P10191_2844486:365-nf] meaning that they are not living in the works of the flesh, you ought not to subvert its form nor its substance, but only the works done in the substance (of the flesh), alienating us from the kingdom of God. It is after displaying to the Galatians these pernicious works that he professes to warn them beforehand, even as he had \"told them in time past, that they which do such things should not inherit the kingdom of God,\"[fn-101-P10192_2844933:366-nf] even because they bore not the image of the heavenly, as they had borne the image of the earthy; and so, in consequence of their old conversation, they were to be regarded as nothing else than flesh and blood. But even if the apostle had abruptly thrown out the sentence that flesh and blood must be excluded from the kingdom of God, without any previous intimation, of his meaning, would it not have been equally our duty to interpret these two substances as the old man abandoned to mere flesh and blood-in other words, to eating and drinking, one feature of which would be to speak against the faith of the resurrection: \"Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.\"[fn-101-P10193_2845622:367-nf] Now, when the apostle parenthetically inserted this, he censured flesh and blood because of their enjoyment in eating and drinking.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_33_oration_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"58","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"54.

Their own righteousness, indeed, he says, they wish to establish; and this righteousness is of the law,-not that the law was established by themselves, but that they had constituted their righteousness in the law which is of God, when they supposed themselves able to fulfil that law by their own strength, ignorant of God's righteousness,-not indeed that by which God is Himself righteous, but that which man has from God. And that you may know that he designated as theirs the righteousness which is of the law, and as God's that which man receives from God, hear what he says in another passage, when speaking of Christ: \"For whose sake I counted all things not only as loss, but I deemed them to be dung, that I might win Christ, and be found in Him-not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, which is of God.\"[fn-60-P6091_2362801:137-nf] Now what does he mean by \"not having my own righteousness, which is of the law,\" when the law is really not his at all, but God's,-except this, that he called it his own righteousness, although it was of the law, because he thought he could fulfil the law by his own will, without the aid of grace which is through faith in Christ?

For they were under the law, not under grace, and therefore sin had dominion over them, from which a man is not freed by the law, but by grace.

Love never faileth.\"[fn-61-P6178_2388565:194-nf] And a little afterwards he says, \"And now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.

My Hebrew master also used to say that those two seraphim in Isaiah, which are described as having each six wings, and calling to one another, and saying, \"Holy, holy, holy, is the Loan God of hosts,\"[fn-63-P6346_1161197:68-nf] were to be understood of the only-begotten Son of God and of the Holy Spirit. And we think that that expression also which occurs in the hymn of Habakkuk, \"In the midst either of the two living things, or of the two lives, Thou wilt be known,\"[fn-63-P6347_1161458:69-nf] ought to be understood of Christ and of the Holy Spirit. For all knowledge of the Father is obtained by revelation of the Son through the Holy Spirit, so that both of these beings which, according to the prophet, are called either \"living things\" or \"lives,\" exist as the ground of the knowledge of God the Father. For as it is said of the Son, that \"no one knoweth the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal Him,\"[fn-63-P6348_1161907:70-nf] the same also is said by the apostle of the Holy Spirit, when He declares, \"God hath revealed them to us by His Holy Spirit; for the Spirit searcheth all things, even the deep things of God; \"[fn-63-P6349_1162117:71-nf] and again in the Gospel, when the Saviour, speaking of the divine and profounder parts of His teaching, which His disciples were not yet able to receive, thus addresses them: \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now; but when the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, is come, He will teach you all things, and will bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\"[fn-63-P6350_1162543:72-nf] We must understand, therefore, that as the Son, who alone knows the Father, reveals Him to whom He will, so the Holy Spirit, who alone searches the deep things of God, reveals God to whom He will: \"For the Spirit bloweth where He listeth.\"[fn-63-P6351_1162823:73-nf] We are not, however, to suppose that the Spirit derives His knowledge through revelation from the Son. For if the Holy Spirit knows the Father through the Son's revelation, He passes from a state of ignorance into one of knowledge; but it is alike impious and foolish to confess the Holy Spirit, and yet to ascribe to Him ignorance. For even although something else existed before the Holy Spirit, it was not by progressive advancement that He came to be the Holy Spirit; as if any one should venture to say, that at the time when He was not yet the Holy Spirit He was ignorant of the Father, but that after He had received knowledge He was made the Holy Spirit. For if this were the case, the Holy Spirit would never be reckoned in the Unity of the Trinity, i.e., along with the unchangeable Father and His Son, unless He had always been the Holy Spirit. When we use, indeed, such terms as \"always\" or \"was,\" or any other designation of time, they are not to be taken absolutely, but with due allowance; for while the significations of these words relate to time, and those subjects of which we speak are spoken of by a stretch of language as existing in time, they nevertheless surpass in their real nature all conception of the finite understanding.","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":5,"verse":21,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_131_the_second_epistle","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"16","folder":"ANF-08","text":"Accordingly we have set these matters before you, in order that those who now know it not may know this; viz., that the priests, too, whom the Lord has taken to Himself from among all men, and has willed to be His own, are not to be dealt with lightly, nor injured, nor rashly accused or reprehended, save by their masters, seeing that the Lord has chosen to reserve their causes to Himself, and ministers vengeance according to His own judgment. For in these and other precepts of the Lord the faithful are distinguished, and the unfaithful at the same time disapproved. For these are rather to be borne with by the faithful than made subjects of reproach (exprobrandi); just as there is chaff with the wheat even to the last winnowing, and as there are bad fish with good even on to their separation, which is yet to be on the shore,-that is to say, at the end of the world. By no means, then, can that man be condemned by a human examination, whom God has reserved for His own judgment, that the purpose of God, according to which He has decreed to save what had perished, may be unalterable. And consequently, as His will suffers no change, let no man presume on matters which are not conceded to him. And herein is the meaning of that word which the apostle speaks: \"Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded? \"[fn-92-P9240_3009696:13-nf] To this, too, our Lord's word may refer: \"And if any man will take away thy coat, and sue thee at the law, let him have thy cloak also.\"[fn-92-P9241_3009852:14-nf] And in another place: \"Of him that taketh away thy goods, ask them not again.\"[fn-92-P9242_3009949:15-nf] Moreover, there are certain things which might be thought most trivial were they not shown in the Scriptures to be of more serious import. Who would ever consider the man who says to his brother \"Thou fool\" worthy of hell-fire, were it not that the Truth Himself told us so?[fn-92-P9243_3010242:16-nf] Those, furthermore, who commit those sins whereof the apostle says, \"They who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God,\"[fn-92-P9244_3010392:17-nf] are by all means to be guarded against, and are to be compelled to seek amendment if they do not choose it voluntarily, because they are marked with the stains of infamy, and go down into the pit, unless assistance is brought them by sacerdotal authority. Those also are to be dealt with in like manner of whom he says, \"With such persons, no, not to eat; \"[fn-92-P9245_3010767:18-nf] because such persons are branded with infamy until they are restored by sacerdotal authority, and reinstated in the bosom of our holy mother the Church; since those who are outside us cannot communicate with us. And it is manifest that these are outside us, and ought to be separated from us, with whom it is not lawful for us to eat or to take food. In like manner also, all persons who underlie the charge of any manner of turpitude and dishonour, are rendered infamous; and all who arm themselves against fathers are rendered infamous. \"Sand, and salt, and a mass of iron, is easier to bear than a man without understanding, and foolish and impious.\"[fn-92-P9246_3011440:19-nf] \"He that wanteth understanding thinks upon vain things; and a foolish and erring man imagineth follies.\"[fn-92-P9247_3011568:20-nf] For their suspicion has overthrown many, and their opinion hath held them in vanity. \"A stubborn heart shall fare evil at the last; and he that loveth danger shall perish therein. A heart that entereth two ways shall not have rest; and the evil heart in them shall be made to stumble. A wicked heart shall be laden with sorrows; and the sinner shall heap sin upon sin.\"[fn-92-P9248_3011960:21-nf] The holy apostles and their successors, having such things in mind, and foreseeing, as being filled with the Holy Spirit, the course of wicked men, and having regard to the simple, determined that the accusing of priests should be a matter undertaken with difficulty, or never undertaken, that they might not be ruined or displaced by wicked men. For if this were made an easy matter to secular and wicked men, there would remain no one, or but the scantiest few; seeing that it ever has been and still is the case-and (which is yet worse) that too in growing measure-that the wicked persecute the good, and that the carnal are hostile to the spiritual. For this reason, then, as has been already said, they decreed that such should not be accused at all; or if that could not be avoided, that the accusing of such should be made a matter of great difficulty. And they determined also, as has been stated above, by what persons that function should not be assumed; and they resolved further, that bishops should not be cast out from their own proper seats and churches. But if in any way the matter of accusation should be taken in hand before their rightful seat and all their property are restored by those laws, they should by no means be accused or criminated by any one, and should not answer any one on such charges, unless they choose to do so of their own accord. But after they have been reinstated, as has been before noted, and have had all their effects restored to them by those laws, when their affairs are arranged and set in order, they should then have a long period allowed them for the disposing of their case; and thereafter, if need be, they should be regularly summoned, and so come to the suit; and if the matter seem just, they should answer the propositions of their accusers with the help of their brethren. For so long as their effects, or their churches and property, are held by their adversaries, or by any person, no manner of reason allows that any charge ought to be preferred against them. And no one is at liberty by any means to bring any charge against them, whether superior or inferior, so long as they are dispossessed of their churches, effects, or powers. In like manner also it was decreed, and we too confirm the same statutes and hereby decree, that if any one among the clergy proves an enemy or traducer of his bishops, and seeks to criminate them, or conspires against them, at once, before the consideration of judicial investigation, he should be removed from the clerical order, and given over to the court (curioe), to which he shall devote himself zealously all the days of his life, and shall remain infamous without any hope of restoration. And let no one ever presume to be at once accuser, and judge, or witness; for in every judicial investigation there must always be four persons present: that is, the judges elected, and the accusers, and the defenders, and the witnesses. In like manner we decree and ordain by apostolic authority, that the flock should not dare to bring a charge against their pastor, to whose care they had been consigned, unless he falls into error in the faith; for the deeds of superiors are not to be smitten with the sword of the mouth; neither can the disciple be above the master, as the voice of Truth saith, \"The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.\"[fn-92-P9249_3015358:22-nf] ","title":"The Second Epistle","author":"The Decretals"},{"chapter":5,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_40_book_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"76","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"19. But what did they actually do? Consider what it was and ask yourself whether the crime is not unexampled? Recall the passage which says: \"But perhaps you will ask me my opinion as to the Only-begotten himself. Well, if I should say that even to him the nature of God is invisible, since it is its very nature to be invisible, do not dismiss my answer as if it were impious or absurd, for I will at once give you my reason for it.\" Well, in the place of the words which I had written, \"I will at once give you my reason for it\" they put the following words: \"Do not dismiss my, answer as if it were impious or absurd, for, as the Son does not see the Father, so the Holy Spirit also does not see the Son.\" If the man who did this, the man who was sent from their monastery[fn-86-P8674_2184179:36-nf] to Rome as the greatest expert in calumny, had been employed in the forum and had committed this forgery in some secular business every one knows what would be the consequence to him according to the public laws, when he was convicted of the crime. But now, since he has left the secular life, and has turned his back upon business and entered a monastery, and has connected himself with a renowned master, he has learned from him to leave his former self-restraint and to become a furious madman: he was quiet before, now he is a mover of sedition: he was peaceable, now he provokes war: instead of concord, he is the promoter of strife. For faith he has learnt perfidiousness, for truth forgery. He would, you may well think, have been the complete exemplar of wickedness and criminality of this kind, if you had not had before you the image of that woman Jezebel.[fn-86-P8675_2185217:37-nf] She is the same who made up the accusation against Naboth the Zezreelite for the sake of the vineyard, and sent word to the wicked eiders to urge against him a false indictment, saying that he had blessed, that is cursed, God and the king. I know not whether of the two is to be accounted the happier, she who sends the command or they who obey it in all its iniquity. These matters are serious; such a crime, as far as I know, is hitherto all but unheard of in the Church. Yet there is something more to be said. What is that you ask. It is this, that those who are guilty should become the judges, that those who plotted the accusation should also pronounce the sentence. It is, indeed, no new thing for a writer to make a mistake or a slip in his words, and in my opinion it is a venial fault, for the Scripture also says,[fn-86-P8676_2186123:38-nf] \"In many things we all stumble: if any stumbleth not in word the same is a perfect man.\" Is it thought that some word is wrong? Then let it he corrected or amended, or, if expediency so require, let it be taken out. But to insert in what another man has written things he never wrote, to put in false words for no other purpose than to defame your brother, to corrupt his writings in order to attach a mark of infamy to the author, and to insinuate your ideas into the ears of the multitude so as to throw confusion into the minds of the simple; and all this with the object of staining a maws reputation among his fellows; I ask you whose work this can be except that of him who was a liar from the beginning, and who, from accusing the brethren, received the name of Diabolus, which means accuser. For when he to whom I have alluded[fn-86-P8677_2186977:39-nf] recited at Milan one of these sentences which had been tampered with, and I cried out that what he was reading was falsified, he, being asked from whom he had received the copy of the work said that a certain woman named Marcella had given it him. As to her, I say nothing, whosoever she may be. I leave her to her own conscience and to God. I am content with God's own witness and with yours. When I say yours, I mean your own and that of Macarius himself, the saintly man for whom I was doing that work: for both of you read my papers themselves at the first, even before they had been completed, and you have by you the completely corrected copies. You can bear witness to what I say. The words \"as the Son does not see the Father, so also the Holy Spirit does not see the Son\" not only were never written by me, but on the contrary I can point out the forger by whom they were written. If any man says that as the Father does not see the Son, so the Son does not see the Father or that the Holy Spirit does not see the Father and the Son as the Father sees the Son and the Son and the Holy Spirit, let him be anathema. For he sees, and sees most truly; only, as God sees God and the Light sees the Light; not as flesh sees flesh, but as the Holy Spirit sees, not with the bodily senses, but by the powers of the Deity. I say, if any one denies this let him be anathema for all eternity.

But, since certain declarations of the Old Testament and of the New lead to the opposite conclusion-namely, that it does not depend on ourselves to keep the commandments and to be saved, or to transgress them and to be lost-let us adduce them one by one, and see the explanations of them, in order that from those which we adduce, any one selecting in a similar way all the passages that seem to nullify free-will, may consider what is said about them by way of explanation. And now, the statements regarding Pharaoh have troubled many, respecting whom God declared several times, \"I will harden Pharaoh's heart.\"[fn-68-P6858_1451150:70-nf] For if he is hardened by God, and commits sin in consequence of being hardened, he is not the cause of sin to himself; and if so, then neither does Pharaoh possess free-will. And some one will say that, in a similar way, they who perish have not free-will, and will not perish of themselves. The declaration also in Ezekiel, \"I will take away their stony hearts, and will put in them hearts of flesh, that they may walk in My precepts, and keep My commandments,\"[fn-68-P6859_1451642:71-nf] might lead one to think that it was God who gave the power to walk in His commandments, and to keep His precepts, by His withdrawing the hindrance-the stony heart, and implanting a better-a heart of flesh. And let us look also at the passage in the Gospel-the answer which the Saviour returns to those who inquired why He spake to the multitude in parables. His words are: \"That seeing they might not see; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest they should be converted, and their sins be forgiven them.\"[fn-68-P6860_1452183:72-nf] The passage also in Paul: \"It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy.\"[fn-68-P6861_1452338:73-nf] The declarations, too, in other places, that \"both to will and to do are of God; \"[fn-68-P6862_1452439:74-nf] \"that God hath mercy upon whom He will have mercy, and whom He will He hardeneth. Thou wilt say then, Why doth He yet find fault? For who hath resisted His will? \"\"The persuasion is of Him that calleth, and not of us.\"[fn-68-P6863_1452682:75-nf] \"Nay, O man, who art thou that repliest against God?

Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour? \"[fn-68-P6864_1452954:76-nf] Now these passages are sufficient of themselves to trouble the multitude, as if man were not possessed of free-will, but as if it were God who saves and destroys whom He will.","title":"Book III.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_47_book_iii_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"64","folder":"ANF-04","text":"3. That there are certain sins, however, which do not proceed from the opposing powers, but take their beginnings from the natural movements of the body, is manifestly declared by the Apostle Paul in the passage: \"The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other; so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.\"[fn-71-P7127_1566560:277-nf] If, then, the flesh lust against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh, we have occasionally to wrestle against flesh and blood, i.e., as being men, and walking according to the flesh, and not capable of being tempted by greater than human temptations; since it is said of us, \"There hath no temptation taken you, but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able.\"[fn-71-P7128_1567014:278-nf] For as the presidents of the public games do not allow the competitors to enter the lists indiscriminately or fortuitously, but after a careful examination, pairing in a most impartial consideration either of size or age, this individual with that-boys, e.g., with boys, men with men, who are nearly related to each other either in age or strength; so also must we understand the procedure of divine providence, which arranges on most impartial principles all who descend into the struggles of this human life, according to the nature of each individual's power, which is known only to Him who alone beholds the hearts of men: so that one individual fights against one temptation of the flesh,[fn-71-P7129_1567730:279-nf] another against a second; one is exposed to its influence for so long a period of time, another only for so long; one is tempted by the flesh to this or that indulgence, another to one of a different kind; one has to resist this or that hostile power, another has to combat two or three at the same time; or at one time this hostile influence, at another that; at some particular date having to resist one enemy, and at another a different one; being, after the performance of certain acts, exposed to one set of enemies, after others to a second. And observe whether some such state of things be not indicated by the language of the apostle: \"God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able,\"[fn-71-P7130_1568475:280-nf] i.e., each one is tempted in proportion to the amount of his strength or power of resistance.[fn-71-P7131_1568590:281-nf] Now, although we have said that it is by the just judgment of God that every one is tempted according to the amount of his strength, we are not therefore to suppose that he who is tempted ought by all means to prove victorious in the struggle; in like manner as he who contends in the lists, although paired with his adversary on a just principle of arrangement, will nevertheless not necessarily prove conqueror. But unless the powers of the combatants are equal, the prize of the victor will not be justly won; nor will blame justly attach to the vanquished, because He allows us indeed to be tempted, but not \"beyond what we are able: \"for it is in proportion to our strength that we are tempted; and it is not written that, in temptation, He will make also a way to escape so as that we should bear it, but a way to escape so as that we should be able to bear it.[fn-71-P7132_1569514:282-nf] But it depends upon ourselves to use either with energy or feebleness this power which He has given us. For there is no doubt that under every temptation we have a power of endurance, if we employ properly the strength that is granted us. But it is not the same thing to possess the power of conquering and to be victorious, as the apostle himself has shown in very cautious language, saying, \"God will make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it,\"[fn-71-P7133_1570089:283-nf] not that you will bear it. For many do not sustain temptation, but are overcome by it. Now God enables us not to sustain (temptation), (otherwise there would appear to be no struggle), but to have the power of sustaining it.[fn-71-P7134_1570335:284-nf] But this power which is given us to enable us to conquer may be used, according to our faculty of free-will, either in a diligent manner, and then we prove victorious, or in a slothful manner, and then we are defeated. For if such a power were wholly given us as that we must by all means prove victorious, and never be defeated, what further reason for a struggle could remain to him who cannot be overcome? Or what merit is there in a victory, where the power of successful resistance[fn-71-P7135_1570852:285-nf] is taken away? But if the possibility of conquering be equally conferred on us all, and if it be in our own power how to use this possibility, i.e., either diligently or slothfully, then will the vanquished be justly censured, and the victor be deservedly lauded. Now from these points which we have discussed to the best of our power, it is, I think, clearly evident that there are certain transgressions which we by no means commit under the pressure of malignant powers; while there are others, again, to which we are incited by instigation on their part to excessive and immoderate indulgence. Whence it follows that we have to inquire how those opposing powers produce these incitements within us.","title":"Book III.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_47_book_iii_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"79","folder":"ANF-04","text":"2.

And if this be the case, it is established that the will of the soul is something intermediate between the flesh add the spirit, undoubtedly obeying and serving that one of the two which it has elected to obey. And if it yield itself up to the pleasures of the flesh, it renders men carnal; but when it unites itself with the spirit, it produces men of the Spirit, and who on that account are termed spiritual. And this seems to be the meaning of the apostle in the words, \"But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit.\"[fn-72-P7225_1611138:358-nf] ","title":"Book III.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":5,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_44_a_treatise_on_the_gift_of_perseverance_being_the_second_book","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"116","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"And when Ambrose said this, he was speaking in that treatise which he wrote concerning Flight\nfrom the World, wherein he taught that this world was to be fled not by the body, but by the heart,\nwhich he argued could not be done except by God's help.

I might well reply as I have done even if it were a question of a promise made with full consciousness. But this is a new and shameless thing; he throws in my teeth a mere dream. How am I to answer? I have no time for thinking of anything outside my own sphere. I wish that I were not prevented from reading even the Holy Scriptures by the throngs that beset this place, and the gathering of Christians from all parts of the world. Still, when a man makes a dream into a crime, I can quote to him the words of the Prophets, who say that we are not to believe dreams; for even to dream of adultery does not condemn us to hell, and to dream of the crown of martyrdom does not raise us to heaven. Often I have seen myself in dreams dead and placed in the grave: often I have flown over the earth and been carried as if swimming through the air, over mountains and seas. My accuser might, therefore, demand that I should cease to live, or that I should have wings on my shoulders, because my mind has often been mocked in sleep by vague fancies of this kind. How many people are rich while asleep and wake to find themselves beggars! or are drinking water to cool their thirst, and wake up with their throats parched and burning! You exact from me the fulfilment of a promise given in a dream. I will meet you with a truer and closer question: Have you done all that you promised in your baptism? Have you or I fulfilled all that the profession of a monk demands? I beg you, think whether you are not looking at the mote in my eye through the beam in your own. I say this against my will; it is by sorrow that my reluctant tongue is forced into words. As to you, it is not enough for you to make up charges about my waking deeds, but you must accuse me for my dreams. You have such an interest in my actions that you must discuss what I have said or done in my sleep. I will not dwell on the way in which, in your zeal to speak against me, you have besmirched your own profession, and have done all you can by word and deed for the dishonouring of the whole body of Christians. But I give you fair warning, and will repeat it again and again. You are attacking a creature who has horns: and, if it were not that I lay to heart the words of the Apostle[fn-91-P9194_2471053:68-nf] \"The evil speakers[fn-91-P9195_2471092:69-nf] shall not inherit the kingdom of God,\" and[fn-91-P9196_2471160:70-nf] \"By hating one another you have been consumed one of another,\" I would make you feel what a vast discord you have stirred up after a slight and pretended reconciliation. What advantage is it to you to heap up slanders against me both among friends and strangers? Is it because I am not an Origenist, and do not believe that I sinned in heaven, that I am accused as a sinner upon earth? And was the result of our renewal of friendship to be, that I was not to speak against heretics for fear that my notice of them should be taken for an assault upon you? So long as I did not refuse to be belauded by you, you followed me as a master, you called me friend and brother, and acknowledged me as a catholic in every respect. But when I asked to be spared your praises, and judged myself unworthy to have such a great man for my trumpeter, you immediately ran your pen through what you had written, and began to abuse all that you had praised before, and to pour forth from the same mouth both sweet and bitter words. I wish you could understand what self-repression I am exerting in not suiting my words to the boiling heat of my breast; and how I pray, like the Psalmist:[fn-91-P9197_2472347:71-nf] \"Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, keep the door of my lips. Incline not my heart to the words of malice;\" and, as he says elsewhere:[fn-91-P9198_2472516:72-nf] \"While the wicked stood before me I was dumb and was humbled and kept silence even from good words;\" and again:[fn-91-P9199_2472661:73-nf] \"I became as a man that heareth not and in whose mouth are no reproofs.\" But for me the Lord the Avenger will reply, as he says through the Prophet:[fn-92-P9200_2472832:74-nf] \"Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord\": and in another place:[fn-92-P9201_2472927:75-nf] \"Thou satest and spakest against thy brother, and hast slandered thy mother's son.

For He was promised by Joel the prophet, but given by Christ. \"In the last days,\" says the prophet, \"I will pour out of my Spirit upon my servants and my handmaids.\"[fn-104-P10421_3281470:243-nf] And the Lord said, \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost: whose sins ye remit, they shall be remitted; and whose ye retain, they shall be retained.\"[fn-104-P10422_3281643:244-nf] But this Holy Spirit the Lord Christ calls at one time \"the Paraclete,\" at another pronounces to be the \"Spirit of truth.\"[fn-104-P10423_3281790:245-nf] And He is not new in the Gospel, nor yet even newly given; for it was He Himself who accused the people in the prophets, and in the apostles gave them the appeal to the Gentiles. For the former deserved to be accused, because they had contemned the law; and they of the Gentiles who believe deserve to be aided by the defence of the Spirit, because they earnestly desire to attain to the Gospel law. Assuredly in the Spirit there are different kinds of offices, because in the times there is a different order of occasions; and yet, on this account, He who discharges these offices is not different, nor is He another in so acting, but He is one and the same, distributing His offices according to the times, and the occasions and impulses of things. Moreover, the Apostle Paul says, \"Having the same Spirit; as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak.\"[fn-104-P10424_3282722:246-nf] He is therefore one and the same Spirit who was in the prophets and apostles, except that in the former He was occasional, in the latter always. But in the former not as being always in them, in the latter as abiding always in them; and in the former distributed with reserve, in the latter all poured out; in the former given sparingly, in the latter liberally bestowed; not yet manifested before the Lord's resurrection, but conferred after the resurrection. For, said He, \"I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Advocate, that He may be with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth.\"[fn-104-P10425_3283345:247-nf] And, \"When He, the Advocate, shall come, whom I shall send unto you from my Father, the Spirit of truth who proceedeth from my Father.\"[fn-104-P10426_3283506:248-nf] And, \"If I go not away, that Advocate shall not come to you; but if I go away, I will send Him to you.\"[fn-104-P10427_3283631:249-nf] And, \"When the Spirit of truth shall come, He will direct you into all the truth.\"[fn-104-P10428_3283735:250-nf] And because the Lord was about to depart to the heavens, He gave the Paraclete out of necessity to the disciples; so as not to leave them in any degree orphans,[fn-104-P10429_3283918:251-nf] which was little desirable, and forsake them without an advocate and some kind of protector. For this is He who strengthened their hearts and minds, who marked out the Gospel sacraments, who was in them the enlightener of divine things; and they being strengthened, feared, for the sake of the Lord's name, neither dungeons nor chains, nay, even trod under foot the very powers of the world and its tortures, since they were henceforth armed and strengthened by the same Spirit, having in themselves the gifts which this same Spirit distributes, and appropriates to the Church, the spouse of Christ, as her ornaments. This is He who places prophets in the Church, instructs teachers, directs tongues, gives powers and healings, does wonderful works, often discrimination of spirits, affords powers of government, suggests counsels, and orders and arranges whatever other gifts there are of charismata; and thus make the Lord's Church everywhere, and in all, perfected and completed. This is He who, after the manner of a dove, when our Lord was baptized, came and abode upon Him, dwelling in Christ full and entire, and not maimed in any measure or portion; but with His whole overflow copiously distributed and sent forth, so that from Him others might receive some enjoyment of His graces: the source of the entire Holy Spirit remaining in Christ, so that from Him might be drawn streams of gifts and works, while the Holy Spirit dwelt affluently in Christ. For truly Isaiah, prophesying this, said: \"And the Spirit of wisdom and understanding shall rest upon Him, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and piety; and the Spirit of the fear of the Lord shall fill Him.\"[fn-104-P10430_3285641:252-nf] This self-same thing also he said in the person of the Lord Himself, in another place, ' \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me; because He has anointed me, He has sent me to preach the Gospel to the poor.\"[fn-104-P10431_3285866:253-nf] Similarly David: \"Wherefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.\"[fn-104-P10432_3285998:254-nf] Of Him the Apostle Paul says: \"For he who hath not the Spirit of Christ is none of His.\"[fn-104-P10433_3286107:255-nf] \"And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.\"[fn-104-P10434_3286186:256-nf] He it is who effects with water the second birth as a certain seed of divine generation, and a consecration of a heavenly nativity, the pledge of a promised inheritance, and as it were a kind of handwriting of eternal salvation; who can make us God's temple, and fit us for His house; who solicits the divine hearing for us with groanings that cannot be uttered; filling the offices of advocacy, and manifesting the duties of our defence,-an inhabitant given for our bodies and an effector of their holiness. Who, working in us for eternity, can also produce our bodies at the resurrection of immortality, accustoming them to be associated in Himself with heavenly power, and to be allied with the divine eternity of the Holy Spirit. For our bodies are both trained in Him and by Him to advance to immortality, by learning to govern themselves with moderation according to His decrees.

There are great proofs of this existing on the part of the blessed martyr Cyprian, in his letters,-to come at last to him of whose authority they carnally flatter themselves they are possessed, whilst by his love they are spiritually overthrown. For at that time, before the consent of the whole Church had declared authoritatively, by the decree of a plenary Council,[fn-31-P3146_1837518:54-nf] what practice should be followed in this matter, it seemed to him, in common with about eighty of his fellow bishops of the African churches, that every man who had been baptized outside the communion of the Catholic Church should, on joining the Church, be baptized anew. And I take it, that the reason why the Lord did not reveal the error in this to a man of such eminence, was, that his pious humility and charity in guarding the peace and health of the Church might be made manifest, and might be noticed, so as to serve as an example of healing power, so to speak, not only to Christians of that age, but also to those who should come after. For when a bishop of so important a Church, himself a man of so great merit and virtue, endowed with such excellence of heart and power of eloquence, entertained an opinion about baptism different from that which was to be confirmed by a more diligent searching into the truth; though many of his colleagues held what was not yet made manifest by authority, but was sanctioned by the past custom of the Church, and afterwards embraced by the whole Catholic world; yet under these circumstances he did not sever himself, by refusal of communion, from the others who thought differently, and indeed never ceased to urge on the others that they should \"forbear one another in love, endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.\"[fn-31-P3147_1838935:55-nf] For so, while the framework of the body remained whole, if any infirmity occurred in certain of its members, it might rather regain its health from their general soundness, than be deprived of the chance of any healing care by their death in severance from the body. And if he had severed himself, how many were there to follow! what a name was he likely to make for himself among men! how much more widely would the name of Cyprianist have spread than that of Donatist! But he was not a son of perdition, one of those of whom it is said, \"Thou castedst them down while they were elevated;\"[fn-31-P3148_1839546:56-nf] but he was the son of the peace of the Church, who in the clear illumination of his mind failed to see one thing, only that through him another thing might be more excellently seen. \"And yet,\" says the apostle, \"show I unto you a more excellent way: though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.\"[fn-31-P3149_1839959:57-nf] He had therefore imperfect insight into the hidden mystery of the sacrament. But if he had known the mysteries of all sacraments, without having charity, it would have been nothing. But as he, with imperfect insight into the mystery, was careful to preserve charity with all courage and humility and faith, he deserved to come to the crown of martyrdom; so that, if any cloud had crept over the clearness of his intellect from his infirmity as man, it might be dispelled by the glorious brightness of his blood. For it was not in vain that our Lord Jesus Christ, when He declared Himself to be the vine, and His disciples, as it were, the branches in the vine, gave command that those which bare no fruit should be cut off, and removed from the vine as useless branches.[fn-31-P3150_1840760:58-nf] But what is really fruit, save that new offspring, of which He further says, \"A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another?\"[fn-31-P3151_1840919:59-nf] This is that very charity, without which the rest profiteth nothing. The apostle also says: \"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance;\"[fn-31-P3152_1841149:60-nf] which all begin with charity, and with the rest of the combination forms one unity in a kind of wondrous cluster.[fn-31-P3153_1841284:61-nf] Nor is it again in vain that our Lord added, \"And every branch that beareth fruit, my Father purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit,\"[fn-31-P3154_1841439:62-nf] but because those who are strong in the fruit of charity may yet have something which requires purging, which the Husbandman will not leave untended. Whilst then, that holy man entertained on the subject of baptism an opinion at variance with the true view, which was afterwards thoroughly examined and confirmed after most diligent consideration, his error was compensated by his remaining in catholic unity, and by the abundance of his charity; and finally it was cleared away by the pruning-hook of martyrdom.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":26,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_56_of_patience_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"40","folder":"ANF-03","text":"There is, too, another chief spur of impatience, the lust of revenge, dealing with the business either of glory or else of malice.

For the term \"for a little\" may mean either of the two things, i.e., it may refer to the shortness of the time, because bodily exercise cannot possibly last on with man both in this life and in the world to come: or it may refer to the smallness of the profit which results from exercising the flesh, because bodily austerities produce some sort of beginnings of progress, but not the actual perfection of love, which has the promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come: and therefore we deem that the practice of the aforesaid works is needful, because without them we cannot climb the heights of love.

As long then as this inequality lasts in this world, this sort of work will be needful and useful to the man that practises it, as it brings to a good purpose and pious will the reward of an eternal inheritance: but it will come to an end in the life to come, where equality will reign, when there will be no longer inequality, on account of which these things must be done, but all men will pass from these manifold practical works to the love of God, and contemplation of heavenly things in continual purity of heart: to which those men who are urgent in devoting themselves to knowledge and purifying the heart, have chosen to give themselves up with all their might and main, betaking themselves, while they are still in the flesh, to that duty, in which they are to continue, when they have laid aside corruption, and when they come to that promise of the Lord the Saviour, which says \"Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.\"[fn-35-P3525_1318808:12-nf] ","title":"I.

III, therefore, for themselves do some interpret, saying that by imposition of hands they receive the Holy Ghost, and are received into the Church, when it is manifest that they ought to be born again by both sacraments in the Catholic Church. For then indeed will they be able to become the sons of God, as the apostle says, `Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God.'[fn-39-P3916_2138057:34-nf] All this the Catholic Church asserts.

Nemesianus of Tubunae has advanced many passages of Scripture to prove his point; but he has in fact said much on behalf of the view of the Catholic Church, which we have undertaken to set forth and maintain. Unless, indeed, we must suppose that he does not \"trust in what is false\" who trusts in the hope of things temporal, as do all covetous men and robbers, and those \"who renounce the world in words but not in deeds,\" of whom Cyprian yet bears witness that such men not only baptize, but even are baptized within the Church.[fn-39-P3920_2140435:37-nf] For they themselves also \"follow flying birds,\"[fn-39-P3921_2140505:38-nf] since they do not attain to what they desire. But not only the heretic, but everyone who leads an evil life \"deserteth the ways of his own vineyard, and hath strayed from the paths of his own field. And he walketh through pathless and dry places, and a land destined to thirst; and he gathereth fruitless weeds in his hands;\" because all justice is fruitful, and all iniquity is barren. Those, again, who \"drink strange water out of a strange fountain,\" are found not only among heretics, but among all who do not live according to the teaching of God, and do live according to the teaching of the devil. For if he were speaking of baptism, he would not say, \"Do not drink of a strange fountain,\" but, do not wash thyself in a strange fountain. Again, I do not see at all what aid he gets towards proving his point from the words of our Lord, \"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\"[fn-39-P3922_2141468:39-nf] For it is one thing to say that every one who shall enter into the kingdom of heaven is first born again of water and the Spirit, because except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven, which is the Lord's saying, and is true; another thing to say that every one who is born of water and the Spirit shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, which is assuredly false. For Simon Magus also was born of water and of the Spirit,[fn-39-P3923_2141957:40-nf] and yet he did not enter into the kingdom of heaven; and this may possibly be the case with heretics as well. Or if only those are born of the Spirit who are changed with a true conversion, all \"who renounce the world in word and not in deed\" are assuredly not born of the Spirit, but of water only, and yet they are within the Church, according to the testimony of Cyprian. For we must perforce grant one of two things,-either those who renounce the world deceitfully are born of the Spirit, though it is to their destruction, not to salvation, and therefore heretics may be so born; or if what is written, that \"the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee deceit,\"[fn-39-P3924_2142640:41-nf] extends to proving as much as this, that those who renounce the world deceitfully are not born of the Spirit, then a man may be baptized with water, and not born of the Spirit, and Nemesianus says in vain that neither the Spirit can work without the water, nor the water without the Spirit. Indeed it has been already often shown how it is possible that men should have one baptism in common who have not one Church, as it is possible that in the body of the Church herself those who are sanctified by their righteousness, and those who are polluted through their covetousness, may not have the same one Spirit, and yet have the same one baptism. For it is said \"one body,\" that is, the Church, just as it is said \"one Spirit\" and \"one baptism.\" The other arguments which he has adduced rather favor our position. For he has brought forward a proof from the gospel, in the words, \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit; for the Spirit is God, and born of God;\"[fn-39-P3925_2143669:42-nf] and he has advanced the argument that therefore all things that are done by any heretic or schismatic are carnal, as the apostle says, \"The works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: fornication, uncleanness;\" and so he goes through the list which the apostle there enumerates, amongst which he has reckoned heresies, since \"they who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-39-P3926_2144082:43-nf] Then he goes on to add, that \"therefore the apostle condemns with all wicked men those also who cause division, that is, schismatics and heretics.\" And in this he does well, that when he enumerates the works of the flesh, among which are also heresies, he found and declared that the apostle condemns them all alike. Let him therefore question the holy Cyprian himself, and learn from him how many even within the Church live according to the evil works of the flesh, which the apostle condemns in common with the heresies, and yet these both baptize and are baptized.

And this commandment have we from Him, That he who loveth God, love his brother also.\"[fn-46-P4622_2490897:1-nf] Thus far we discoursed. Let us see then what comes next in order. \"Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God.\"[fn-46-P4623_2491048:2-nf] Who is he that believeth not that Jesus is the Christ? He that does not so live as Christ commanded. For many say, \"I believe:\" but faith without works saveth not. Now the work of faith is Love, as Paul the apostle saith, \"And faith which worketh by love.\"[fn-46-P4624_2491321:3-nf] Thy past works indeed, before thou didst believe, were either none, or if they seemed good, were nothing worth. For if they were none, thou wast as a man without feet, or with sore feet unableto walk: but if they seemed good, before thou didst believe, thou didst run indeed, but by running aside from the way thou wentest astray instead of coming to the goal. It is for us, then, both to run, and to run in the way. He that runs aside from the way, runs to no purpose, or rather runs but to toil. He goes the more astray, the more he runs aside from the way. What is the way by which we run? Christ hath told us, \"I am the Way.\"[fn-46-P4625_2491965:4-nf] What the home to which we run? \"I am the Truth.\" By Him thou runnest, to Him thou runnest, in Him thou restest. But, that we might run by Him, He reached even unto us: for we were afar off, foreigners in a far country. Not enough that we were in a far country, we were feeble also that we could not stir. A Physician, He came to the sick: a Way, He extended Himself to them that were in a far country. Let us be saved by Him, let us walk in Him. This it is to \"believe that Jesus is the Christ,\" as Christians believe, who are not Christians only in name, but in deeds and in life, not as the devils believe. For \"the devils also believe and tremble,\"[fn-46-P4626_2492633:5-nf] as the Scripture tells us. What more could the devils believe, than that they should say, \"We know who thou art, the Son of God?\"[fn-46-P4627_2492780:6-nf] What the devils said, the same said Peter also. When the Lord asked them who He was, and whom did men say that He was, the disciples made answer to Him, \"Some say that thou art John the Baptist; some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God.\"[fn-46-P4628_2493190:7-nf] And this he heard from the Lord: \"Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona; for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.\" See what praises follow this faith. \"Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church.\" What meaneth, \"Upon this rock I will build my Church\"? Upon this faith; upon this that has been said, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God. Upon this rock,\" saith He, \"I will build my Church.\" Mighty praise! So then, Peter saith, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God:\" the devils also say, \"We know who thou art, the Son of God, the Holy One of God.\" This Peter said, this also the devils: the words the same, the mind not the same. And how is it clear that Peter said this with love? Because a Christian's faith is with love, but a devil's without love. How without love? Peter said this, that he might embrace Christ; the devils said it, that Christ might depart from them. For before they said, \"We know who thou art, the Son of God, they said, \"What have we to do with thee? Why art thou come to destroy us before the time?\" It is one thing then to confess Christ that thou mayest hold Christ, another thing to confess Christ that thou mayest drive Christ from thee. So then ye see, that in the sense in which he here saith, \"Whoso believeth,\" it is a faith of one's own, not as one has a faith in common with many. Therefore, brethren, let none of the heretics say to you, \"We also believe.\" For to this end have I given you an instance from the case of devils, that ye may not rejoice in the words of believing, but search well the deeds of the life.","title":"Homily X.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_141_homily_x_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"2.

The Jews say that the circumcision performed on the eighth day is the principal circumcision, and that which is performed according to circumstances is different; and probably it was performed on account of the hostility of some angel towards the Jewish nation, who had the power to injure such of them as were not circumcised, but was powerless against those who had undergone the rite. This may be said to appear from what is written in the book of Exodus, where the angel before the circumcision of Eliezer[fn-100-P10082_2660378:161-nf] was able to work against[fn-100-P10083_2660490:162-nf] Moses, but could do nothing after his son was circumcised. And when Zipporah had learned this, she took a pebble and circumcised her child, and is recorded, according to the reading of the common copies, to have said, \"The blood of my child's circumcision is stayed,\" but according to the Hebrew text, \"A bloody husband art thou to me.\"[fn-100-P10084_2660862:163-nf] For she had known the story about a certain angel having power before the shedding of the blood, but who became powerless through the blood of circumcision.

I For this angel might have had power, I think, over those of the people who were not circumcised, and generally over all who worshipped only the Creator; and this power lasted so long as Jesus had not assumed a human body. But when He had done this, and had undergone the rite of circumcision in His own person, all the power of the angel over those who practise the same worship, but are not circumcised,[fn-100-P10085_2661800:164-nf] was abolished; for Jesus reduced it to nought by (the power of) His unspeakable divinity.

But now I think that it is fully time for me to bring to their due termination these books also on the subject of baptism, in which our Lord God has shown to us, through the words of the peaceful Bishop Cyprian and his brethren who agreed with him, how great is the love which should be felt for catholic unity; so that even where they were otherwise minded until God should reveal even this to them,[fn-45-P4568_2286691:160-nf] they should rather bear with those who thought differently from themselves, than sever themselves from them by a wicked schism; whereby the mouths of the Donatists are wholly closed, even if we say nothing of the followers of Maximian. For if the wicked pollute the good in unity, then even Cyprian himself already found no Church to which he could be joined. But if the wicked do not infect the good in unity, then the sacrilegious Donatist has no ground to set before himself for separation. But if baptism is both possessed and transferred by the multitude of others who work the works of the flesh, of which it is said, that \"they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God,\"[fn-45-P4569_2287409:161-nf] then it is possessed and transferred also by heretics, who are numbered among those works; because they could have transferred it had they remained, and did not lose it by their secession. But men of this kind confer it on their fellows as fruitlessly and uselessly as the others who resemble them, inasmuch as they shall not inherit the kingdom of God. And as, when those others are brought into the right path, it is not that baptism begins to be present, having been absent before, but that it begins to profit them, having been already in them; so is it the case with heretics as well. Whence Cyprian and those who thought with him could not impose limits on the Catholic Church, which they would not mutilate.

Any one might answer the charge that God is incapable of admonishing men; for He conveys His admonitions throughout the whole of Scripture, and by means of those persons who, through God's gracious appointment, are the instructors of His hearers. Unless, indeed, some peculiar meaning be understood to attach to the word \"admonish,\" as if it signified both to penetrate into the mind of the person admonished, and to make him hear the words of his[fn-106-P10652_2840292:289-nf] instructor, which is contrary to the usual meaning of the word. To the objection, \"How is he incapable of persuading? \"-which also might be brought against all who believe in providence,-we have to make the following remarks. Since the expression \"to be persuaded\" belongs to those words which are termed, so to speak, \"reciprocal\"[fn-106-P10653_2840725:290-nf] (compare the phrase \"to shave a man,\" when he makes an effort to submit himself to the barber[fn-106-P10654_2840879:291-nf] , there is for this reason needed not merely the effort of him who persuades, but also the submission, so to speak, which is to be yielded to the persuader, or the acceptance of what is said by him. And therefore it must not be said that it is because God is incapable of persuading men that they are not persuaded, but because they will not accept the faithful words of God. And if one were to apply this expression to men who are the \"artificers of persuasion,\"[fn-106-P10655_2841439:292-nf] he would not be wrong; for it is possible for a man who has thoroughly learned the principles of rhetoric, and who employs them properly, to do his utmost to persuade, and yet appear to fail, because he cannot overcome the will of him who ought to yield to his persuasive arts. Moreover, that persuasion does not come from God, although persuasive words may be uttered by him, is distinctly taught by Paul, when he says: \"This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.\"[fn-106-P10656_2841943:293-nf] Such also is the view indicated by these words: \"If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land; but if ye refuse and rebel, a sword shall devour you.\"[fn-106-P10657_2842135:294-nf] For that one may (really) desire what is addressed to him by one who admonishes, and may become deserving of those promises of God which he hears, it is necessary to secure the will of the hearer, and his inclination to what is addressed to him. And therefore it appears to me, that in the book of Deuteronomy the following words are uttered with peculiar emphasis: \"And now, O Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, and to walk in all His ways, and to love Him, and to keep His commandments? \"[fn-106-P10658_2842701:295-nf] ","title":"Book VI.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_52_iv_conference_of_abbot_daniel_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"45","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"This conflict too we read in the Apostle has for our good been placed in our members: \"For the flesh lusteth against the spirit: and the spirit against the flesh.

If, consequently, a self-restraint and righteousness, and whatever qualities are regarded as following them, is the virtue of the male, it belongs to the male alone to be virtuous, and to the woman to be licentious and unjust.

Since even the Spirits of the Prophets are subject to the prophets,[fn-54-P5454_1822413:7-nf] according to the order of the Spirit who regulates and divides all things well. And do not wonder that, while he rendered his account privately and to some, I do so publicly, and to all. For my need is greater than his, of being aided by the freedom of my censors, if I am proved to have failed in my duty, lest I should run, or have run, in vain.[fn-54-P5455_1822780:8-nf] And the only possible mode of self-defence is speech in the presence of men who know the facts.","title":"Oration XLII.","author":"Gregory Nazianzen"},{"chapter":5,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_53_v_conference_of_abbot_serapion_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"42","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"And to make this clearer not only by a short discussion to the best of my ability, but by Scripture proof as well, gluttony and fornication, though they exist in us naturally (for sometimes they spring up without any incitement from the mind, and simply at the motion and allurement of the flesh) yet if they are to be consummated, must find an external object, and thus take effect only through bodily acts. For \"every man is tempted of his own lust. Then lust when it has conceived beareth sin, and sin when it is consummated begets death.\"[fn-41-P4104_1511974:3-nf] For the first Adam could not have fallen a victim to gluttony unless he had had material food at hand, and had used it wrongly, nor could the second Adam be tempted without the enticement of some object, when it was said to Him: \"If Thou art the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.\"[fn-41-P4105_1512297:4-nf] And it is clear to everybody that fornication also is only completedby a bodily act, as God says of this spirit to the blessed Job: \"And his force is in his loins, and his strength in the navel of his belly.\"[fn-41-P4106_1512525:5-nf] And so these two faults in particular, which are carried into effect by the aid of the flesh, especially require bodily abstinence as well as spiritual care of the soul; since the determination of the mind is not in itself enough to resist their attacks (as is sometimes the case with anger or gloominess or the other passions, which an effort of the mind alone can overcome without any mortification of the flesh); but bodily chastisement must be used as well, and be carried out by means of fasting and vigils and acts of contrition; and to this must be added change of scene, because since these sins are the results of faults of both mind and body, so they can only be overcome by the united efforts of both. And although the blessed Apostle says generallythat all faults are carnal, since he enumerates enmities and anger and heresies among other works of the flesh,[fn-41-P4107_1513412:6-nf] yet in order to cure them and to discover their nature more exactly we make a twofold division of them: for we call some of them carnal, and some spiritual. And those we call carnal, which specially have to do with pampering the appetites of the flesh, and with which it is so charmed and satisfied, that sometimes it excites the mind when at rest and even drags it against its will to consent to its desire. Of which the blessed Apostle says: \"In which also we all walked in time past in the desires of our flesh, fulfilling the will of the flesh and of our thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath even as the rest.\"[fn-41-P4108_1514056:7-nf] But we call those spiritual which spring only from the impulse of the mind andnot merely contribute no pleasure to the flesh, but actually bring on it a weakness that is harmful to it, and only feed a diseased mind with the food of a most miserable pleasure. And therefore these need a single medicine for the heart: but those which are carnal can only be cured, as we said, by a double remedy. Whence it is extremely useful for those who aspire to purity, to begin by withdrawing from themselves the material which feeds these carnal passions, through which opportunity for or recollection of these same desires can arise in a soul that is still affected by the evil. For a complicated disease needs a complicated remedy. For from the body the object and material which would allure it must be withdrawn, for fear lest the lust should endeavour to break out into act; and before the mind we should no less carefully place diligent meditation on Scripture and watchful anxiety and the withdrawal into solitude, lest it should give birth to desire even in thought. But as regards other faults intercourse with our fellows is no obstacle, or rather it is of the greatest possible use, to those who truly desire to get rid of them, because in mixing with others they more often meet with rebuke, and while they are more frequently provoked the existence of the faults is made evident, and so they are cured with speedy remedies.","title":"V.

Augustin answered: We do not make a pretense of peace by wickedness, but we preach peace out of the gospel; and if you were at peace with it, you would be at peace also with us. The risen Lord, when presenting Himself to the disciples, not only that they should gaze on Him with their eyes, but also that they should handle Him with their hands, began His discourse to them with the words, \"Peace be unto you.\" And how this peace itself was to be maintained, He disclosed to them in the words which followed. For \"then opened He their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures, and said unto them, Thus is it written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day; and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.\"[fn-52-P5201_2524828:197-nf] If you will keep peace with these words, you will not be at variance with us. For if we seek unity by war, our war could not be praised in more glorious terms, seeing that it is written, \"Thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself.\"[fn-52-P5202_2525087:198-nf] And again it is written, \"No man ever yet hated his own flesh.\"[fn-52-P5203_2525174:199-nf] And yet the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh.[fn-52-P5204_2525273:200-nf] But if no man ever yet hated his own flesh, and yet a man lusteth against his own flesh, here you have unity sought by war, that the body, being subject to correction, may be brought under submission. But what the spirit does against the flesh, waging war with it, not in hatred but in love, this those who are spiritual do against those who are carnal, that they may do towards them what they do towards themselves, because they love their neighbors as neighbors indeed. But the war which the spiritual wage is that correction which is in love: their sword is the word of God. To such a war they are aroused by the trumpet of the apostle sounding with a mighty force: \"Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering and doctrine.\"[fn-52-P5205_2526081:201-nf] See then that we act not with the sword, but with the word.

Augustin answered: What you say is true. For that priesthood in the body of Christ had an anointing, and its salvation is secured by the bond of unity. For indeed Christ Himself derives His name from chrism, that is, from anointing. Him the Hebrews call the Messiah, which word is closely akin to the Phoenician language, as is the case with very many other Hebrew words, if not with almost all.[fn-54-P5489_2653937:328-nf] What then is meant by the head in that priesthood, what by the beard, what by the skirts of the garments? So far as the Lord enables me to understand, the head is none other than the Saviour of the body, of whom the apostle says, \"And He is the head of the body, the Church.\"[fn-54-P5490_2654709:329-nf] By the beard is not unsuitably understood fortitude. Therefore, on those who show themselves to be brave in His Church, and cling to the light of His countenance, to preach the truth without fear, there descends from Christ Himself, as from the head, a sacred ointment, that is to say, the sanctification of the Spirit. By the skirts of the garments we are here given to understand that which is at the top of the garments, through which the head of Him who gives the clothing enters. By this are signified those who are perfected in faith within the Church. For in the skirts is perfection. And I presume you must remember what was said to a certain rich man: \"If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shall have treasure in heaven; and come and follow me.\"[fn-54-P5491_2655530:330-nf] He indeed went away sorrowful, slighting what was perfect, choosing what was imperfect. But does it follow that there were wanting those who were so made perfect by such a surrender of earthly things, that the ointment of unity descended upon them, as from the head upon the skirts of the garments? For, putting aside the apostles, and those who were immediately associated with those leaders and teachers of the Church, whom we understand to be represented with greater dignity and more conspicuous fortitude in the beard, read in the Acts of the Apostles, and see those who \"brought the prices of the things that were sold, and laid them down at the apostles' feet. Neither said any of them that aught of the things which he possessed was his own: but they had all things common: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need. And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul.\"[fn-54-P5492_2656477:331-nf] I doubt not that you are aware that it is so written. Recognize, therefore, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity. Recognize the beard of Aaron; recognize the skirts of the spiritual garments. Search the Scriptures themselves, and see where those things began to be done; you will find that it was in Jerusalem. From this skirt of the garment is woven together the whole fabric of unity throughout all nations. By this the Head entered into the garment, that Christ should be clothed with all the variety of the several nations of the earth, because in this skirt of the garment appeared the actual variety of tongues. Why, therefore, is the Head itself, whence that ointment of unity descended, that is, the spiritual fragrance of brotherly love,-why, I say, is the Head itself exposed to your resistance, while it testifies and declares that \"repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem\"?[fn-54-P5493_2657487:332-nf] And by this ointment you wish the sacrament of chrism to be understood, which is indeed holy as among the class of visible signs, like baptism itself, but yet can exist even among the worst of men, wasting their life in the works of the flesh, and never destined to possess the kingdom of heaven, and having therefore nothing to do either with the beard of Aaron, or with the skirts of his garments, or with any fabric of priestly clothing. For where do you intend to place what the apostle enumerates as \"the manifest works of the flesh, which,\" he says, \"are these: fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, poisonings, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, heresies, envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God?\"[fn-54-P5494_2658386:333-nf] I put aside fornications, which are committed in secret; interpret uncleanness as you please, I am willing to put it aside as well. Let us put on one side also poisons, since no one is openly a compounder or giver of poisons. I put aside also heresies, since you will have it so. I am in doubt whether I ought to put aside idolatry, since the apostle classes with it covetousness, which is openly rife among you. However, setting aside all these, are there none among you lascivious, none covetous, none open in their indulgence of enmities, none fond of strife, or fond of emulation, wrathful, given to seditions, envious, drunken, wasting their time in revellings? Are none of such a character anointed among you? Do none die well known among you to be given to such things, or openly indulging in them? If you say there are none, I would have you consider whether you do not come under the description yourself, since you are manifestly telling lies in the desire for strife. But if you are yourself severed from men of this sort, not by bodily separation, but by dissimilarity of life, and if you behold with lamentation crowds like these around your altars, what shall we say, since they are anointed with holy oil, and yet, as the apostle assures us with the clearness of truth, shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Must we do such impious despite to the beard of Aaron and to the skirts of his garments, as to suppose that they are to be placed there? Far be that from us. Separate therefore the visible holy sacrament, which can exist both in the good and in the bad,-in the former for their reward, in the latter for judgment; separate it from the invisible unction of charity, which is the peculiar property of the good. Separate them, separate them, ay, and may God separate you from the party of Donatus, and call you back again into the Catholic Church, whence you were torn by them while yet a catechumen, to be bound by them in the bond of a deadly distinction. Now are ye not in the mountains of Zion, the dew of Hermon on the mountains of Zion, in whatever sense that be received by you; for you are not in the city upon a hill, which has this as its sure sign, that it cannot be hid.

Augustin answered: Against this error I have said much already, both in this work and elsewhere. But since you think that in this sentence you have so strong a confirmation of your vain opinions, that you deemed it right to end your epistle with these words, that they might remain as it were the fresher in the minds of your readers, I think it well to make a short reply. We recognize in heretics that baptism, which belongs not to the heretics but to Christ, in such sort as in fornicators, in unclean persons or effeminate, in idolaters, in poisoners, in those who retain enmity, in those who are fond of contention, in the credulous, in the proud, given to seditions, in the envious, in drunkards, in revellers; and in men like these we hold valid the baptism which is not theirs but Christ's. For of men like these, and among them are included heretics also, none, as the apostle says, shall inherit the kingdom of heaven.[fn-55-P5524_2670119:347-nf] Nor are they to be considered as being in the body of Christ, which is the Church, simply because they are materially partakers of the sacraments. For the sacraments indeed are holy, even in such men as these, and shall be of force in them to greater condemnation, because they handle and partake of them unworthily. But the men themselves are not within the constitution of the Church, which increases in the increase of God in its members through connection and contact with Christ. For that Church is founded on a rock, as the Lord says, \"Upon this rock I will build my Church.\"[fn-55-P5525_2670723:348-nf] But they build on the sand, as the same Lord says, \"Every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand.\"[fn-55-P5526_2670938:349-nf] But that you may not suppose that the Church which is upon a rock is in one part only of the earth, and does not extend even to its furthest boundaries, hear her voice groaning from the psalm, amid the evils of her pilgrimage. For she says, \"From the end of the earth have I cried unto Thee; when my heart was distressed Thou didst lift me up upon the rock; Thou hast led me, Thou, my hope, hast become a tower of courage from the face of the enemy.\"[fn-55-P5527_2671411:350-nf] See how she cries from the end of the earth. She is not therefore in Africa alone, nor only among the Africans, who send a bishop from Africa to, Rome to a few Montenses,[fn-55-P5528_2671604:351-nf] and into Spain to the house of one lady.[fn-55-P5529_2671957:352-nf] See how she is exalted on a rock. All, therefore, are not to be deemed to be in her which build upon the sand, that is, which hear the words of Christ and do them not, even though both among us and among you they have and transmit the sacrament of baptism. See how her hope is in God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost,-not in Peter or in Paul, still less in Donatus or Petilianus. What we fear, therefore, to destroy, is not yours, but Christ's; and it is holy of itself, even in sacrilegious hands. For we cannot receive those who come from you, unless we destroy in them whatsoever appertains to you. For we destroy the treachery of the deserter, not the stamp of the sovereign. Accordingly, do you yourself consider and annul what you said: \"I,\" say you, \"baptize their polluted ones; they, though may God never grant them such an opportunity, receive those who are made mine by baptism.\" For you do not baptize men who are infected, but you rebaptize them, so as to infect them with the fraud of your error. But we do not receive men who are made yours by baptism; but we destroy that error of yours whereby they are made yours, and we receive the baptism of Christ, by which they are baptized. Therefore it is not without significance that you introduce the words, \"Though may God never grant them such an opportunity.\" For you said, \"They, though may God never grant them such an opportunity, receive those who are made mine by baptism.\" For while you in your fear that we may receive your followers desire to be understood, \"may God never give them the opportunity of receiving such as are mine,\" I suppose that, without knowing what it meant, you said, \"May God never make them mine that you should receive them.\" For we pray that those may not be really yours who come over at the present moment to the Catholic Church. Nor do they come over so as to be ours by right of baptism, but by fellowship with us, and that with us they may belong to Christ, in virtue of their baptism.

The lesson of the Holy Gospel which has just been read, has given us an alarming warning, lest we have leaves only, and have no fruit. That is, in few words, lest words be present and deeds be wanting. Very terrible! Who does not fear when in this lesson he sees with the eyes of the heart the withered tree, withered at that word being spoken to it, \"Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever\"?[fn-47-P4780_2051162:1-nf] Let the fear work amendment, and the amendment bring forth fruit. For without doubt, the Lord Christ foresaw that a certain tree would deservedly become withered, because it would have leaves, and would have no fruit. That tree is the synagogue, not that which was called, but that which was reprobate. For out of it also was called the people of God, who in sincerity and truth waited in the Prophets for the salvation of God, Jesus Christ. And forasmuch as it waited infaith, it was thought worthy[fn-47-P4781_2051680:2-nf] to know Him when He was present. For out of it came the Apostles, out of it came the whole multitude of those who went before the ass of the Lord, and said, \"Hosanna to the Son of David, blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the Lord.\"[fn-47-P4782_2051930:3-nf] There was a great company then of believing Jews, a great company of those who believed in Christ before He shed His Blood for them. For it was not in vain that the Lord Himself had come to none \"but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\"[fn-47-P4783_2052190:4-nf] But in others, after He was crucified, and was now exalted into heaven, He found the fruit of repentance; and these He did not make to wither, but cultivated them in His field, and watered them with His word. Of this number were those four thousand Jews who believed, after that the disciples and those who were with them, filled with the Holy Ghost, spake with the tongues of all nations,[fn-47-P4784_2052597:5-nf] and in that diversity of tongues announced in a way beforehand, that the Church should be throughout all nations. They believed at that time, and \"they were the lost sheep of the house of Israel;\" but because \"the Son of Man had come to seek and to save that which was lost,\"[fn-47-P4785_2052888:6-nf] He found these also. But they lay hid here and there among thorns, as though wasted and dispersed by the wolves; and because they lay hid among thorns, He did not come to find them, save when torn by the thorns of His Passion; yet come He did, He found, He redeemed them. They had slain, not Him so much, as themselves. They were saved by Him who was slain for them. For, as the Apostles spake, they were pricked;[fn-47-P4786_2053320:7-nf] they were pricked in conscience, who had pricked Him with the spear; and being pricked they sought for counsel, received it when it was given, repented, found grace, and believing drunk that Blood which in their fury they had shed. But they who have remained in this bad and barren race, even unto this day, and shall remain unto the end, were figured in that tree. You come to them at this day, and find with them all the writings of the Prophets. But these are but leaves; Christ is an hungred, and He seeketh for fruit; but findeth no fruit among them, because He doth not find Himself among them. For He hath no fruit, who hath not Christ. And he hath not Christ, who holdeth not to Christ's unity, who hath not charity. And so by this chain he hath no fruit who hath not charity. Hear the Apostle, \"Now the fruit of the Spirit is charity;\" so setting forth the praise of this cluster, that is, of this fruit; \"The fruit of the Spirit,\" he says, \"is charity,[fn-47-P4787_2054299:8-nf] joy, peace, long-suffering.\" Do not wonder at what follows, when charity leads the way.","title":"Sermon XXXIX.

Because then, in order to understand the mystery[fn-49-P4915_2106527:15-nf] of God, how Christ is both man and God, the heart must be cleansed: and it is cleansed by a good conversation, by a pure life,[fn-49-P4916_2106672:16-nf] by chastity, and sanctity, and love, and by \"faith, which worketh by love\"[fn-49-P4917_2106758:17-nf] (now all this that I am speaking of, is, as it were, the tree which hath its root in the heart; for it is only from the root of the heart that actions proceed; in which if thou plant desire, thorns spring forth; if thou plant charity, good fruit): the Lord, after that question which He had proposed to the Jews, when they were not able to answer it, immediately went on to speak of good actions, that He might show why they were unworthy to understand what He asked them. For when those proud and wretched men were not able to answer, they ought of course to. have said, \"we do not know; Master, tell us.\" But no: they were speechless at the proposing of the question, and they opened not their mouth to seek instruction. And so the Lord in reference to their pride said immediately, \"Beware of the Scribes which love the chief seats in the synagogues, and the first rooms at feasts.\"[fn-49-P4918_2107661:18-nf] Not because they hold them, but because they love them. For in these words he accused their heart. Now none can accuse the heart, but He who can inspect it. For meet it is that to the servant of God, who holds some post of honour in the Church, the first place should be assigned; because if it were not given him, it were evil for him who refuses to give it; but yet it is no good to him to whom it is given. It is meet and right then that in the congregation of Christians their Prelates[fn-49-P4919_2108186:19-nf] should sit in eminent place, that by their very seat they may be distinguished, and that their office may be duly marked; yet not so that they should be puffed up for their seat; but that they should esteem it a burden, for which they are to render an account. But who knows whether they love this, or do not love it? This is a matter of the heart, it can have no other judge but God. Now the Lord Himself warned His disciples, that they should not fall into this leaven; as He calls it in another place, \"Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.\"[fn-49-P4920_2108779:20-nf] And when they supposed that He said this to them because they had brought no bread; He answered them, \"Have ye forgotten how many thousands were filled with the five loaves?

For the gain to the Apostle Paul from his strictness would not have counterbalanced the loss to all nations from his speedy death. And this would certainly have been then incurred by the whole Church unless this good and salutary hypocrisy had preserved him for the preaching of the Gospel. For then we may rightly and pardonably acquiesce in the wrong of a lie, when, as we said, a greater harm depends on telling the truth, and when the good which results to us from speaking the truth cannot counterbalance the harm which will be caused by it. And elsewhere the blessed Apostle testifies in other words that he himself always observed this disposition; for when he says: \"To the Jews I became as a Jew that I might gain the Jews; to those who were under the law as being under the law, though not myself under the law, that I might gain those who were under the law; to those who were without law, I became as without law, though I was not without the law of God but under the law of Christ, that I might gain those who were without law; to the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I became all things to all men, that I might save all;\"[fn-59-P5931_2099236:20-nf] what does he show but that according to the weakness and the capacity of those who were being instructed he always lowered himself and relaxed something of the vigour of perfection, and did not cling to what his own strict life might seem to demand, but rather preferred that which the good of the weak might require? And that we may trace these matters out more carefully and recount one by one the glories of the good deeds of the Apostles, some one may ask how the blessed Apostle can be proved to have suited himself to all men in all things. When did he to the Jews become as a Jew? Certainly in the case where, while he still kept in his inmost heart the opinion which he had maintained to the Galatians saying: \"Behold, I, Paul, say unto you that if ye be circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing,\"[fn-59-P5932_2100068:21-nf] yet by circumcising Timothy he adopted a shadow as it were of Jewish superstition. And again, where did he become to those under the law, as under the law? There certainly where James and all the Elders of the Church, fearing lest he might be attacked by the multitude of Jewish believers, or rather of Judaizing Christians, who had received the faith of Christ in such a way as still to be bound by the rites of legal ceremonies, came to his rescue in his difficulty with this counsel and advice, and said: \"Thou seest, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews, who have believed, and they are all zealots for the law. But they have heard of thee that thou teachest those Jews who are among the Gentiles to depart from Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children;\" and below: \"Do therefore this that we say unto thee: we have four men who have a vow on them. These take and sanctify thyself with them and bestow on them, that they may shave their heads; and all will know that the things which they have heard of thee are false, but that thou thyself also walkest keeping the law.\"[fn-59-P5933_2101198:22-nf] And so for the good of those who were under the law, he trode under foot for a while the strict view which he had expressed: \"For I through the law am dead unto the law that I may live unto God;\"[fn-59-P5934_2101416:23-nf] and was driven to shave his head, and be purified according to the law and pay his vows after the Mosaic rites in the Temple. Do you ask also where for the good of those who were utterly ignorant of the law of God, he himself became as if without law? Read the introduction to his sermon at Athens where heathen wickedness was flourishing: \"As I passed by,\" he says, \"I saw your idols and an altar on which was written: To the unknown God;\" and when he had thus started from their superstition, as if he himself also had been without law, under the cloke of that profane inscription he introduced the faith of Christ, saying: \"What therefore ye ignorantly worship, that declare I unto you.\" And after a little, as if he had known nothing whatever of the Divine law, he chose to bring forward a verse of a heathen poet rather than a saying of Moses or Christ, saying: \"As some also of your own poets have said: for we are also His offspring.\" And when he had thus approached them with their own authorities, which they could not reject, thus confirming the truth by things false, he added and said: \"Since then we are the offspring of God we ought not to think that the Godhead is like to gold or silver or stone sculptured by the art and device of man.\"[fn-59-P5935_2102689:24-nf] But to the weak he became weak, when, by way of permission, not of command, he allowed those who could not contain themselves to return together again,[fn-59-P5936_2102865:25-nf] or when he fed the Corinthians with milk and not with meat, and says that he was with them in weakness and fear and much trembling.[fn-59-P5937_2103021:26-nf] But he became all things to all men that he might save all, when he says: \"He that eateth let him not despise him that eateth not, and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth:\"and: \"He that giveth his virgin in marriage doeth well, and he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better;\" and elsewhere: \"Who,\" says he, \"is weak, and I am not weak? Who is offended, and I burn not?\" and in this way he fulfilled what he had commanded the Corinthians to do when he said: \"Be ye without offence to Jews and Greeks and the Church of Christ, as I also please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit but that of the many, that they may be saved.\"[fn-59-P5938_2103712:27-nf] For it had certainly been profitable not to circumcise Timothy, not to shave his head, not to undergo Jewish purification, not to practice going barefoot,[fn-59-P5939_2103935:28-nf] not to pay legal vows; but he did all these things because he did not seek his own profit but that of the many. And although this was done with the full consideration of God, yet it was not free from dissimulation. For one who through the law of Christ was dead to the law that he might live to God, and who had made and treated that righteousness of the law in which he had lived blameless, as dung, that he might gain Christ, could not with true fervour of heart offer what belonged to the law; nor is it right to believe that he who had said: \"For if I again rebuild what I have destroyed, I make myself a transgressor,\"[fn-59-P5940_2104934:29-nf] would himself fall into what he had condemned. And to such an extent is account taken, not so much of the actual thing which is done as of the disposition of the doer, that on the other hand truth is sometimes found to have injured some, and a lie to have done them good. For when Saul was grumbling to his servants about David's flight, and saying: \"Will the son of Jesse give you all fields and vineyards, and make you all tribunes and centurions: that all of you have conspired against me, and there is no one to inform me,\" did Doeg the Edomite say anything but the truth, when he told him: \"I saw the son of Jesse in Nob, with Abimelech the son of Ahitub the priest, who consulted the Lord for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him also the sword of Goliath the Philistine?\"[fn-59-P5941_2105735:30-nf] For which true story he deserved to be rooted up out of the land of the living, and it is said of him by the prophet: \"Wherefore God shall destroy thee forever, and pluck thee up and tear thee out of thy tabernacle, and thy root from the land of the living:\"[fn-59-P5942_2106018:31-nf] He then for showing the truth is forever plucked and rooted up out of that land in which the harlot Rahab with her family is planted for her lie: just as also we remember that Samson most injuriously betrayed to his wicked wife the truth which he had hidden for a long time by a lie, and therefore the truth so inconside-rately disclosed was the cause of his own deception, because he had neglected to keep the command of the prophet: \"Keep the doors of thy mouth from her that sleepeth in thy bosom.\"[fn-59-P5943_2106543:32-nf] ","title":"XVII.

To what purpose dost thou make ready teeth and stomach? Believe, and thou hast eaten already. Faith is indeed distinguished from works, even as the apostle says, \"that a man is justified by faith without the works of the law:\"[fn-12-P1240_780373:13-nf] there are works which appear good, without faith in Christ; but they are not good, because they are not referred to that end in which works are good; \"for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.\"[fn-12-P1241_780624:14-nf] For that reason, He willeth not to distinguish faith from work, but declared faith itself to be work. For it is that same faith that worketh by love.[fn-12-P1242_780790:15-nf] Nor did He say, This is your work; but, \"This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He has sent;\" so that he who glories, may glory in the Lord. And because He invited them to faith, they, on the other hand, were still asking for signs by which they might believe. See if the Jews do not ask for signs. \"They said therefore rate Him, What sign doest thou, that we may see and believe thee? what dost thou work?\" Was it a trifle that they were fed with five loaves? They knew this indeed, but they preferred manna from heaven to this food. But the Lord Jesus declared Himself to be such an one, that He was superior to Moses. For Moses dared not say of Himself that He gave, \"not the meat which perisheth, but that which endureth to eternal life.\" Jesus promised something greater than Moses gave. By Moses indeed was promised a kingdom, and a land flowing with milk and honey, temporal peace, abundance of children, health of body, and all other things, temporal goods indeed, yet in figure spiritual; because in the Old Testament they were promised to the old man. They considered therefore the things promised by Moses, and they considered the things promised by Christ. The former promised a full belly on the earth, but of the meat which perisheth; the latter promised, \"not the meat which perisheth, but that which endureth unto eternal life.\" They gave attention to Him that promised the more, but just as if they did not yet see Him do greater things. They considered therefore what sort of works Moses had done, and they wished yet some greater works to be done by Him who promised them such great things. What, say they, doest thou, that we may believe thee?

If we have understood this, thanks be to God; but if any has not sufficiently understood, man has done as far as he could: as for the rest, let him see whence he may hope to understand. As laborers outside, we can plant and water; but it is of God to give the increase. \"My doctrine,\" saith He, \"is not mine, but His that sent me.\" Let him who says he has not yet understood hear counsel. For since it was a great and profound matter that had been spoken, the Lord Christ Himself did certainly see that all would not understand this so profound a matter, and He gave counsel in the sequel. Dost thou wish to understand? Believe. For God has said by the prophet: \"Except ye believe, ye shall not understand.\"[fn-13-P1391_878774:2-nf] To the same purpose what the Lord here also added as He went on\"If any man is willing to do His will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak from myself.\" What is the meaning of this, \"If any man be willing to do His will\"? But I had said, if any man believe; and I gave this counsel: If thou hast not understood, said I, believe. For understanding is the reward of faith. Therefore do not seek to understand in order to believe, but believe that thou mayest understand; since, \"except ye believe, ye shall not understand.\" Therefore when I would counsel the obedience of believing toward the possibility of understanding, and say that our Lord Jesus Christ has added this very thing in the following sentence, we find Him to have said, \"If any man be willing to do His will, he shall know of the doctrine.\" What is \"he shall know\"? It is the same thing as \"he shall understand.\" But what is \"If any man be willing to do His will\"? It is the same thing as to believe. All men indeed perceive that \"shall know\" is the same thing as \"shall understand:\" but that the saying, \"If any man be willing to do His will,\" refers to believing, all do not perceive; to perceive this more accurately, we need the Lord Himself for expounder, to show us whether the doing of the Father's will does in reality refer to believing. But who does not know that this is to do the will of God, to work the work of God; that is, to work that work which is pleasing to Him? But the Lord Himself says openly in another place: \"This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He has sent.\"[fn-13-P1392_880401:3-nf] \"That ye believe on Him,\" not, that ye believe Him. But if ye believe on Him, ye believe Him; yet he that believes Him does not necessarily believe on Him. For even the devils believed Him, but they did not believe on Him. Again, moreover, of His apostles we can say, we believe Paul; but not, we believe on Paul: we believe Peter; but not, we believe on Peter. For, \"to him that believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted unto him for righteousness.\"[fn-13-P1393_880893:4-nf] What then is \"to believe on Him\"? By believing to love Him, by believing to esteem highly, by believing to go into Him and to be incorporated in His members. It is faith itself then that God exacts from us: and He finds not that which He exacts, unless He has bestowed what He may find. What faith, but that which the apostle has most amply defined in another place, saying, \"Neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith that worketh by love?\"[fn-13-P1394_881377:5-nf] Not any faith of what kind soever, but \"faith that worketh by love:\" let this faith be in thee, and thou shall understand concerning the doctrine.

That \"this doctrine is not mine, but His that sent me;\" that is, thou shall understand that Christ the Son of God, who is the doctrine of the Father, is not from Himself, but is the Son of the Father.","title":"Tractate XXIX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_75_xxiii_the_third_conference_of_abbot_theonas_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"72","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"This then is that body of death from which we cannot escape, pent in which those who are perfect, who have tasted \"how gracious the Lord is,\"[fn-66-P6633_2373692:51-nf] daily feel with the prophet \"how bad for himself and bitter it is for a man to depart from the Lord his God.\"[fn-66-P6634_2373831:52-nf] This is the body of death which restrains us from the heavenly vision and drags us back to earthly things, which causes men while singing Psalms and kneeling in prayer to have their thoughts filled with human figures, or conversations, or business, or unnecessary actions.

However, I suppose even they will be unwilling to proceed to such lengths, if they follow Asterius the sophist. For he, earnest as he is in his advocacy of the Arian heresy, and maintaining that the Unoriginate is one, runs counter to them in saying, that the Wisdom of God is unoriginate and without beginning also. The following is a passage out of his work[fn-55-P5503_2177479:180-nf] : `The Blessed Paul said not that he preached Christ the power of God or the wisdom of God, but, without the article, `God's power and God's wisdom[fn-55-P5504_2177661:181-nf] ;' thus preaching that the proper power of God Himself, which is natural to Him and co-existent with Him unoriginatedly, is something besides.' And again, soon after: `However, His eternal power and wisdom, which truth argues to be without beginning and unoriginate; this must surely be one.' For though, misunderstanding the Apostle's words, he considered that there were two wisdoms; yet, by speaking still of a wisdom coexistent with Him, he declares that the Unoriginate is not simply one, but that there is another Unoriginate with Him. For what is coexistent, coexists not with itself, but with another. If then they agree with Asterius, let them never ask again, `Is the Unoriginate one or two,' or they will have to contest the point with him; if, on the other hand, they differ even from him, let them not rely upon his treatise, lest, `biting one another, they be consumed one of another[fn-55-P5505_2178580:182-nf] .' So much on the point of their ignorance; but who can say enough on their crafty character? who but would justly hate them while possessed by such a madness? for when they were no longer allowed to say `out of nothing' and `He was not before His generation,' they hit upon this word `unoriginate,' that, by saying among the simple that the Son was `originate,' they might imply the very same phrases `out of nothing,' and `He once was not;' for in such phrases things originated and creatures are implied.","title":"Discourse I","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":5,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_76_xxiv_conference_of_abbot_abraham_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"32","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"This twenty-fourth Conference of Abbot Abraham[fn-66-P6675_2387789:1-nf] is by the favour of Christ produced, which concludes the traditions and decisions of all the Elders; and when by the aid of your prayers it has been finished, as the numbermystically corresponds to that of the four and twenty Elders who are said in the holy Apocalypse[fn-66-P6676_2388085:2-nf] to offer their crowns to the Lamb, we think that we shall have paid the debt of all our promises.

All this by faith, so long as we are absent from the Lord, dwelling in the body; but when we shall have traversed the way, and have reached the home itself, what shall be more joyful than we? What shall be more blessed than we? Because nothing more at peace than we; for there will be no rebelling against a man. But now, brethren, it is difficult for us to be without strife. We have indeed been called to concord, we are commanded to have peace among ourselves; to this we must give our endeavor, and strain with all our might, that we may come at last to the most perfect peace; but at present we are at strife, very often with those whose good we are seeking. There is one who goes astray, thou wishest to lead him to the way; he resists, thou strivest with him: the pagan resists thee, thou disputest against the errors of idols and devils; a heretic resists, thou disputest against other doctrines of devils; a bad catholic is not willing to live aright, thou rebukest even thy brother within; he dwells with thee in the house, and seeks the paths of ruin; thou art inflamed with eager passion to put him right, that thou mayest render to the Lord a good account of both concerning him. How many necessities of strife there are on every side! Very often one is overcome with weariness, and says to himself, \"What have I to do with bearing with gainsayers, bearing with those who render evil for good? I wish to benefit them, they are willing to perish; I wear out my life in strife; I have no peace; besides, I make enemies of those whom I ought to have as friends, if they regarded the good will of him that seeks their good: what business is it of mine to endure this?

Since, then, every one that committeth sin is the servant of sin, listen to what is our hope of liberty. \"And the servant,\" He says, \"abideth not in the house for ever.\" The church is the house, the servant is the sinner. Many sinners enter the church. Accordingly He has not said, \"The servant\" is not in the house, but \"abideth not in the house for ever.\" If, then, there shall be no servant there, who will be there? For \"when\" as the Scripture speaketh, \"the righteous king sitteth on the throne, who will boast of having a clean heart? or who will boast that he is pure from his sin?\"[fn-17-P1750_1109495:19-nf] He has greatly alarmed us, my brethren, by saying, \"The servant abideth not in the house for ever.\" But He further adds, \"But the Son abideth ever.\" Will Christ, then, be alone in His house? Will no people remain at His side? Whose head will He be, if there shall be no body? Or is the Son all this, both the head and the body? For it is not without cause that He has inspired both terror and hope: terror, in order that we should not love sin; and hope, that we should not be distrustful of the remission of sin. \"Every one,\" He says, \"that committeth sin is the servant of sin. And the servant abideth not in the house for ever.\" What hope, then, have we, who are not without sin? Listen to thy hope: \"The Son abideth for ever. If the Son, therefore, shall make you free, then shall ye be free indeed.\" Our hope is this, brethren, to be made free by the free One; and that, in setting us free, He may make us His servants. For we were the servants of lust; but being set free, we are made the servants of love. This also the apostle says: \"For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only Use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.\"[fn-17-P1751_1110691:20-nf] Let not then the Christian say, I am free; I have been called unto liberty: I was a slave, but have been redeemed, and by my very redemption have been made free, I shall do what I please: no one may balk me of my will, if I am free. But if thou committest sin with such a will, thou art the servant of sin. Do not then abuse your liberty for freedom in sinning, but use it for the purpose of sinning not. For only if thy will is pious, will it be free. Thou wilt be free, if thou art a servant still,-free from sin, the servant of righteousness : as the apostle says, \"When ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness. But now, being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.\"[fn-17-P1752_1111473:21-nf] Let us be striving after the latter, and be doing the other.","title":"Tractate XLI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_46_tractate_xli_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"10. The first stage of liberty, then, is to be free from crimes [sinful conduct]. And so the Apostle Paul, when he determined on the ordination of either elders or deacons, or whoever was to be ordained to the superintendence of the Church, says not, If any one is without sin; for had he said so, every one would be rejected as unfit, none would be ordained: but he says, \"If any one is without crime\" [E.V. blame],[fn-17-P1759_1114443:26-nf] such as, murder, adultery, any uncleanness of fornication, theft, fraud, sacrilege, and others of that sort. When a man has begun to be free from these (and every Christian man ought to be so), he begins to raise his head to liberty; but that is liberty begun, not completed. Why, says some one, is it not completed liberty?Because, \"I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind;\" \"for what I would,\" he says, \"that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.\"[fn-17-P1760_1114952:27-nf] \"The flesh,\" he says, \"lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; so that ye do not the things that ye would.\"[fn-17-P1761_1115105:28-nf] In part liberty, in part bondage: not yet entire, not yet pure, not yet full liberty, because not yet eternity. For we have still infirmity in part, in part we have attained to liberty. Whatever has been our sin, was previously wiped out in baptism. But because all our iniquity has been blotted out, has there remained no infirmity? If there had not, we should be living here without sin. Yet who would venture to say so, but the proud, but the man unworthy of the Deliverer's mercy, but he who wishes to be self-deceived, and who is destitute of the truth? Hence, from the fact that some infirmity remains, I venture to say that, in what measure we serve God, we are free; in what measure we serve the law of sin, we are still in bondage. Hence says the apostle, what we began to say, \"I delight in the law of God after the inward man. \"[fn-17-P1762_1115962:29-nf] Here then it is, wherein we are free, wherein we delight in the law of God; for liberty has joy. For as long as it is from fear that thou doest what is right, God is no delight to thee. Find thy delight in Him, and thou art free. Fear not punishment, but love righteousness.

But what is this, \"He shall go in and out, and find pasture\"? To enter indeed into the Church by Christ the door, is eminently good; but to go out of the Church, as this same John the evangelist saith in his epistle, \"They went out from us, but they were not of us,\"[fn-19-P1959_1221315:28-nf] is certainly otherwise than good. Such a going out could not then be commended by the good Shepherd, when He said, \"And he shall go in and out, and find pasture.\" There is therefore not only some sort of entrance, but some outgoing also that is good, by the good door, which is Christ. But what is that praiseworthy and blessed outgoing? I might say, indeed, that we enter when we engage in some inward exercise of thought; and go out, when we take to some active work without: and since, as the apostle saith, Christ dwelleth in our hearts by faith,[fn-19-P1960_1221887:29-nf] to enter by Christ is to give ourselves to thought in accordance with that faith; but to go out by Christ is, in accordance also with that same faith, to take to outside works, that is to say, in the presence of others. Hence, also, we read in a psalm, \"Man goeth forth to his work;\"[fn-19-P1961_1222191:30-nf] and the Lord Himself saith, \"Let your works shine before men.\"[fn-19-P1962_1222273:31-nf] But I am better pleased that the Truth Himself, like a good Shepherd, and therefore a good Teacher, hath in a certain measure reminded us how we ought to understand His words, \"He shall go in and out, and find pasture,\" when He added in the sequel, \"The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.\" For He seems to me to have meant, That they may have life in coming in, and have it more abundantly at their departure. For no one can pass out by the door-that is, by Christ-to that eternal life which shall be open to the sight, unless by the same door-that is, by the same Christ-he has entered His church, which is His fold, to the temporal life, which is lived in faith. Therefore, He saith, \"I am come that they may have life,\" that is, faith, which worketh by love;[fn-19-P1963_1223165:32-nf] by which faith they enter the fold that they may live, for the just liveth by faith:[fn-19-P1964_1223268:33-nf] \"and that they may have it more abundantly,\" who, enduring unto the end, pass out by this same door, that is, by the faith of Christ; for as true believers they die, and will have life more abundantly when they come whither the Shepherd hath preceded them, where they shall die no more. Although, therefore, there is no want of pasture even here in the fold,-for we may understand the words \"and shall find pasture\" as referring to both, that is, both to their going in and their going out,-yet there only will they find the true pasture. where they shall be filled who hunger and thirst after righteousness,[fn-19-P1965_1223893:34-nf] -such pasture as was found by him to whom it was said, \"To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.\"[fn-19-P1966_1224009:35-nf] But how He Himself is the door, and Himself the Shepherd, so that He also may in a certain respect be understood as going in and out by Himself, and who is the porter, it would be too long to inquire to-day, and, according to the grace given us by Himself, to unfold in the way of dissertation.

It is a worthy subject of inquiry how these words of the Lord are to be understood, \"But I have called you friends: for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.\" For who is there that dare affirm or believe that any man knoweth all things that the only-begotten Son hath heard of the Father; when there is no one that can comprehend even how He heareth any word of the Father, being as He is Himself the only Word of the Father? Nay more, is it not the case that a little afterwards, in this same discourse, which He delivered to the disciples between the Supper and His passion, He said, \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now\"?[fn-29-P2974_1694110:1-nf] How, then, are we to understand that He made known unto the disciples all that He had heard of the Father, when there are many things that He saith not, just because He knows that they cannot bear them now? Doubtless what He is yet to do He says that He has done as the same Being who hath made those things which are yet to be.[fn-29-P2975_1694457:2-nf] For as He says by the prophet, \"They pierced my hands and my feet,\"[fn-29-P2976_1694542:3-nf] and not, They will yet pierce; but speaking as it were of the past, and yet predicting what Was still in the future: so also in the passage before us He declares that He has made known to the disciples all, that He knows He will yet make known in that fullness of knowledge, whereof the apostle says, \"But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.\" For in the same place he adds: \"Now I know in part, but then shall I know, even as also I am known; and now through a glass in a riddle, but then face to face.\"[fn-29-P2977_1695111:4-nf] For the same apostle also says that we have been saved by the washing of regeneration,[fn-29-P2978_1695222:5-nf] and yet declares in another place, \"We are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is no hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.\"[fn-29-P2979_1695453:6-nf] To a similar purpose it is also said by his fellow-apostle Peter, \"In whom, though now seeing Him not, ye believe; and in whom, when ye see Him, ye shall rejoice with a joy unspeakable and glorious: receiving the reward of faith, even the salvation of your souls.\"[fn-29-P2980_1695740:7-nf] If, then, it is now the season of faith, and faith's reward is the salvation of our souls; who, in that faith which worketh by love,[fn-29-P2981_1695892:8-nf] can doubt that the day must come to an end, and at its close the reward be received; not only the redemption of our body, whereof the Apostle Paul speaketh,[fn-29-P2982_1696063:9-nf] but also the salvation of our souls, as we are told by the Apostle Peter? For the felicity springing from both is at this present time, and in the existing state of mortality, a matter rather of hope than of actual possession. But this it concerns us to remember, that our outward man, to wit the body, is still decaying; but the inward, that is, the soul, is being renewed day by day.[fn-29-P2983_1696468:10-nf] Accordingly, while we are waiting for the immortality of the flesh and salvation of our souls in the future, yet with the pledge we have received, it may be said that we are saved already; so that knowledge of all things which the Only-begotten hath heard of the Father we are to regard as a matter of hope still lying in the future, although declared by Christ as something He had already imparted.","title":"Tractate LXXXVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_92_tractate_lxxxvii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"1. In the Gospel lesson which precedes this one, the Lord had said: \"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and appointed you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and [that] your fruit should remain; that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, He may give it you.\" On these word you remember that we have already discoursed, as the Lord enabled us. But here, that is, in the succeeding lesson which you have heard read, He says: \"These things I command you, that ye love one another.\" And thereby we are to understand that this is our fruit, of which He had said, \"I have chosen you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and [that] your fruit should remain.\" And what He subjoined, \"That whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, He may give it you,\" He will certainly give us if we love one another; seeing that this very thing He has also given us, in choosing us when we had no fruit, because we had chosen Him not; and appointing us that we should bring forth fruit,-that is, that we should love one another,-a fruit that we cannot have apart from Him, just as the branches can do nothing apart from the vine. Our fruit, therefore, is charity, which the apostle explains to be, \"Out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned.\"[fn-29-P2998_1702227:1-nf] So love we one another, and so love we God. For it would be with no true love that we loved one another, if we loved not God. For every one loves his neighbor as himself if he loves God; and if he loves not God, he loves not himself. For on these two commandments of love hang all the law and the prophets:[fn-29-P2999_1702550:2-nf] this is our fruit. And it is in reference, therefore, to such fruit that He gives us commandment when He says, \"These things I command you, that ye love one another.\" In the same way also the Apostle Paul, when wishing to commend the fruit of the Spirit in opposition to the deeds of the flesh, posited this as his principle, saying, \"The fruit of the Spirit is love;\" and then, as if springing from and bound up in this principle, he wove the others together, which are \"joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.\"[fn-30-P3000_1703119:3-nf] For who can truly rejoice who loves not good as the source of his joy? Who can have true peace, if he have it not with one whom he truly loves? Who can be long-enduring through persevering continuance in good, save through fervent love? Who can be kind, if he love not the person he is aiding? Who can be good, if he is not made so by loving? Who can be sound in the faith, without that faith which worketh by love? Whose meekness can be beneficial in character, if not regulated by love? And who will abstain from that which is debasing, if he love not that which dignifies? Appropriately, therefore, does the good Master so frequently commend love, as the only thing needing to be commended, without which all other good things can be of no avail, and which cannot be possessed without bringing with it those other good things that make a man truly good.","title":"Tractate LXXXVII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_97_tractate_xcii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"1. The Lord Jesus, in the discourse which He addressed to His disciples after the supper, when Himself in immediate proximity to His passion, and, as it were, on the eve of departure, and of depriving them of His bodily presence while continuing His spiritual presence to all His disciples till the very end of the world, exhorted them to endure the persecutions of the wicked, whom He distinguished by the name of the world: and from which He also told them that He had chosen, the disciples themselves, that they might know it was by the grace of God they were what they were, and by their own vices they had been what they had been. And then His own persecutors and theirs He clearly signified to be the Jews, that it might be perfectly apparent that they also were included in the appellation of that damnable world that persecuteth the saints. And when He had said of them that they knew not Him that sent Him, and yet hated both the Son and the Father, that is, both Him who was sent and Him who sent Him,-of all which we have already treated in previous discourses,-He reached the place where it is said, \"This cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.\" And then He added, as if by way of consequence, the words whereon we have undertaken at present to discourse: \"But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, who proceedeth from the Father, He shall bear witness of me: and ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.\" But what connection has this with what He had just said, \"But now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father: but that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause\"? Was it that the Comforter, when He came, even the Spirit of truth, convicted those, who thus saw and hated, by a still clearer testimony? Yea, verily, some even of those who saw, and still hated, He did convert, by this manifestation of Himself, to the faith that worketh by love.[fn-30-P3097_1740767:1-nf] To make this view of the passage intelligible, we recall to your mind that so it actually befell. For when on the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit fell upon an assembly of one hundred and twenty men, among whom were all the apostles; and when they, filled therewith were speaking in the language of every nation; a goodly number of those who had hated, amazed at the magnitude of the miracle (especially when they perceived in Peter's address so great and divine a testimony borne in behalf of Christ, as that He, who was slain by them and accounted amongst the dead, was proved to have risen again, and to be now alive), were pricked in their hearts and converted; and so became aware of the beneficent character of that precious blood which had been so impiously and cruelly shed, because themselves redeemed by the very blood which they had shed.[fn-30-P3098_1741631:2-nf] For the blood of Christ was shed so efficaciously for the remission of all sins, that it could wipe out even the very sin of shedding it. With this therefore in His eye, the Lord said, \"They hated me without a cause: but when the Comforter is come, He shall bear witness of me;\" saying, as it were, They hated me, and slew me when I stood visibly before their eyes; but such shall be the testimony borne in my behalf by the Comforter, that He will bring them to believe in me when I am no longer visible to their sight.","title":"Tractate XCII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_251_letter_ccxxxiii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"I. I Know that I have myself heard of this, and I am aware of the constitution of mankind. What shall I say? The mind is a wonderful thing, and therein we possess that which is after the image of the Creator. And the operation of the mind is wonderful; in that, in its perpetual motion, it frequently forms imaginations about things non-existent as though they were existent, and is frequently carried straight to the truth. But there are in it two faculties; in accordance with the view of us who believe in God, the one evil, that of the daemons which draws us on to their own apostasy; and the divine and the good, which brings us to the likeness of God. When, therefor, the mind remains alone and unaided, it contemplates small things, commensurate with itself. When it yields to those who deceive it, it nullifies its proper judgment, and is concerned with monstrous fancies. Then it considers wood to be no longer wood, but a god; then it looks on gold no longer as money, but as an object of worship.[fn-54-P5446_1715055:2-nf] If on the other hand it assents to its diviner part, and accepts the boons of the Spirit, then, so fir as its nature admits, it becomes perceptive of the divine. There are, as it were, three conditions of life, and three operations of the mind. Our ways may be wicked, and the movements of our mind wicked; such as adulteries, thefts, idolatries, slanders, strife, passion, sedition, vain-glory, and all that the apostle Paul enumerates among the works of the flesh.[fn-54-P5447_1715746:3-nf] Or the soul's operation is, as it were, in a mean, and has nothing about it either damnable or laudable, as the perception of such mechanical crafts as we commonly speak of as indifferent, and, of their own character, inclining neither towards virtue nor towards vice. For what vice is there in the craft of the helmsman or the physician ? Neither are these operations in themselves virtues, but they incline in one direction or the other in accordance with the will of those who use them. But the mind which is impregnated with the Godhead of the Spirit is at once capable of viewing great objects; it beholds the divine beauty, though only so far as grace imparts and its nature receives.","title":"Letter CCXXXIII.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":5,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_83_letter_lxv","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"IF I continue to insist on the privileges to which my superior age entitles me, and wait for you to take the initiative in communication , and if you, my friend, wish to adhere more persistently to your evil counsel of inaction, what end will there be to our silence?
