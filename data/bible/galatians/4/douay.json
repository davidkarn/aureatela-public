{"verses":["As long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a\nservant, though he be lord of all,","But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the\nfather.","So we also, when we were children, were serving under the elements\nof the world.","But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent his Son, made\nof a woman, made under the law:","That he might redeem them who were under the law:  that we might\nreceive the adoption of sons.","And because you are sons, God hath sent the Spirit of his Son into\nyour hearts, crying:  Abba, Father.","Therefore, now he is not a servant, but a son.  And if a son, an\nheir also through God.","But then indeed, not knowing God, you served them who, by nature,\nare not gods.","But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known by\nGod:  how turn you again to the weak and needy elements which you desire\nto serve again?","You observe days and months and times, and years.","I am afraid of you, lest perhaps I have laboured in vain among\nyou.","Be ye as I, because I also am as you brethren, I beseech you.  You\nhave not injured me at all.","And you know how, through infirmity of the flesh, I preached the\ngospel to you heretofore:  and your temptation in my flesh","You despised not, nor rejected:  but received me as an angel of\nGod, even as Christ Jesus.","Where is then your blessedness?  For I bear you witness that, if\nit could be done, you would have plucked out your own eyes and would\nhave given them to me.","Am I then become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?","They are zealous in your regard not well:  but they would exclude\nyou, that you might be zealous for them.","But be zealous for that which is good in a good thing always:  and\nnot only when I am present with you.","My little children, of whom I am in labour again, until Christ be\nformed in you.","And I would willingly be present with you now and change my\nvoice:  because I am ashamed for you.","Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, have you not read\nthe law?","For it is written that Abraham had two sons:  the one by a\nbondwoman and the other by a free woman.","But he who was of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh:\nbut he of the free woman was by promise.","Which things are said by an allegory.  For these are the two\ntestaments.  The one from Mount Sina, engendering unto bondage, which is\nAgar.","For Sina is a mountain in Arabia, which hath affinity to that\nJerusalem which now is:  and is in bondage with her children.","But that Jerusalem which is above is free:  which is our mother.","For it is written:  Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not:  break\nforth and cry thou that travailest not:  for many are the children of\nthe desolate, more than of her that hath a husband.","Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.","But as then he that was born according to the flesh persecuted\nhim that was after the spirit:  so also it is now.","But what saith the scripture?  Cast out the bondwoman and her son:\nfor the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free\nwoman.","So then, brethren, we are not the children of the bondwoman but\nof the free:  by the freedom wherewith Christ has made us free."]}
