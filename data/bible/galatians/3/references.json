But, however, that it might be certain that He was sent by God, it was befitting that He should not be born as man is born, composed of a mortal on both sides;[fn-15-P1597_647252:335-nf] but that it might appear that He was heavenly even in the form of man, He was born without the office of a father. For He had a spiritual Father, God; and as God was the Father of His spirit without a mother, so a virgin was the mother of His body without a father. He was therefore both God and man, being placed in the middle between God and man. From which the Greeks call Him Mesites,[fn-15-P1598_647682:336-nf] that He might be able to lead man to God-that is, to immortality: for if He had been God only (as we have before said), He would not have been able to afford to man examples of goodness; if He had been man only, He would not have been able to compel men to righteousness, unless there had been added an authority and virtue greater than that of man.","title":"Book IV.

And in this way we defend the apostle when he calls the Galatians fools,[fn-3-P342_85272:83-nf] to whom he also gives, the name of brethren; for he does not do it without cause.

But it is rather that statement which the Lord Himself makes in another passage which is wont to disturb the minds of the little ones, who nevertheless earnestly desire to live now according to the precepts of Christ: \"If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.\"[fn-4-P417_115810:131-nf] For it may seem a contradiction to the less intelligent, that here He forbids the putting away of a wife saving for the cause of fornication, but that elsewhere He affirms that no one can be a disciple of His who does not hate his wife. But if He were speaking with reference to sexual intercourse, He would not place father, and mother, and brothers in the same category. But how true it is, that \"the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and they that use violence take it by force!\"[fn-4-P418_116318:132-nf] For how great violence is necessary, in order that a man may love his enemies, and hate his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers! For He commands both things who calls us to the kingdom of heaven. And how these things do not contradict each other, it is easy to show under His guidance; but after they have been understood, it is difficult to carry them out, although this too is very easy when He Himself assists us. For in that eternal kingdom to which He has vouchsafed to call His disciples, to whom He also gives the name of brothers, there are no temporal relationships of this sort. For \"there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female;\" \"but Christ is all, and in all.\"[fn-4-P419_117152:133-nf] And the Lord Himself says: \"For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage,[fn-4-P420_117289:134-nf] but are as the angels of God in heaven.\"[fn-4-P421_117371:135-nf] Hence it is necessary that whoever wishes here and now to aim after the life of that kingdom, should hate not the persons themselves, but those temporal relationships by which this life of ours, which is transitory and is comprised in being born and dying, is upheld; because he who does not hate them, does not yet love that life where there is no condition of being born and dying, which unites parties in earthly wedlock.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":27,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"277","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1.

We are told, for instance, that lamentation was made for Moses; yet when the funeral of Joshua is described[fn-12-P1241_266494:836-nf] no mention at all is made of weeping. The reason, of course, is that under Moses-that is under the old Law-all men were bound by the sentence passed on Adam's sin, and when they descended into hell[fn-12-P1242_266715:837-nf] were rightly accompanied with tears. For, as the apostle says, \"death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned.\"[fn-12-P1243_266898:838-nf] But under Jesus,[fn-12-P1244_266934:839-nf] that is, under the Gospel of Christ, who has unlocked for us the gate of paradise, death is accompanied, not with sorrow, but with joy. The Jews go on weeping to this day; they make bare their feet, they crouch in sackcloth, they roll in ashes. And to make their superstition complete, they follow a foolish custom of the Pharisees, and eat lentils,[fn-12-P1245_267341:840-nf] to show, it would seem, for what poor fare they have lost their birthright.[fn-12-P1246_267571:841-nf] Of course they are right to weep, for as they do not believe in the Lord's resurrection they are being made ready for the advent of antichrist. But we who have put on Christ[fn-12-P1247_267766:842-nf] and according to the apostle are a royal and priestly race,[fn-12-P1248_267847:843-nf] we ought not to grieve for the dead. \"Moses,\" the Scripture tells us, \"said unto Aaron and unto Eleazar, and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left: Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people.\"[fn-12-P1249_268122:844-nf] Rend not your clothes, he says, neither mourn as pagans, lest you die. For, for us sin is death. In this same book, Leviticus, there is a provision which may perhaps strike some as cruel, yet is necessary to faith: the high priest is forbidden to approach the dead bodies of his father and mother, of his brothers and of his children;[fn-12-P1250_268487:845-nf] to the end, that no grief may distract a soul engaged in offering sacrifice to God, and wholly devoted to the Divine mysteries. Are we not taught the same lesson in theGospel in other words? Is not the disciple forbidden to say farewell to his home or to bury his dead father?[fn-12-P1251_268788:846-nf] Of the high priest, again, it is said: \"He shall not go out of the sanctuary, and the sanctification of his God shall not be contaminated, for the anointing oil of his God is upon him.\"[fn-12-P1252_268997:847-nf] Certainly, now that we have believed in Christ, and bear Him within us, by reason of the oil of His anointing which we have received,[fn-12-P1253_269158:848-nf] we ought not to depart from His temple-that is, from our Christian profession-we ought not to go forth to mingle with the unbelieving Gentiles, but always to remain within, as servants obedient to the will of the Lord.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":3,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"683","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"5. Your third and last question relates to the passage in the same epistle where the apostle in discussing the resurrection, comes to the words: \"for he must reign, till he hath put all things under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith, all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him. And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be all in all.\"[fn-23-P2305_578271:1643-nf] I am surprised that you have resolved to question me about this passage when that reverend man, Hilary, bishop of Poictiers, has occupied the eleventh book of his treatise against the Arians with a full examination and explanation of it. Yet I may at least say a few words. The chief stumbling-block in the passage is that the Son is said to be subject to the Father. Now which is the more shameful and humiliating, to be subject to the Father (often a mark of loving devotion as in the psalm \"truly my soul is subject unto God\"[fn-23-P2306_578827:1644-nf] ) or to be crucified and made the curse of the cross? For \"cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree.\"[fn-23-P2307_578958:1645-nf] If Christ then for our sakes was made a curse that He might deliver us from the curse of the law, are you surprised that lie is also for our sakes subject to the Father to make us too subject to Him as He says in the gospel: \"No man cometh unto the Father but by me,\"[fn-23-P2308_579249:1646-nf] and \"I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.\"[fn-23-P2309_579341:1647-nf] Christ then is subject to the Father in the faithful; for all believers, nay the whole human race, are accounted members of His body. But in unbelievers, that is in Jews, heathens, and heretics, He is said to be not subject; for these members of His body are not subject to the faith. But in the end of the world when all His members shall see Christ, that is their own body, reigning, they also shall be made subject to Christ, that is to their own body, that the whole of Christ's body may be subject unto God and the Father, and that God may be all in all. He does not say \"that the Father may be all in all\" but that \"God\" may be, a title which properly belongs to the Trinity and may be referred not only to the Father but also to the Son and to the Holy Ghost. His meaning therefore is \"that humanity may be subject to the Godhead.\" By humanity we here intend not that gentleness and kindness which the Greeks call philanthropy but the whole human race. Moreover when he says \"that God may be all in all,\" it is to be taken in this sense. At present our Lord and Saviour is not all in all, but only a part in each of us. For instance He is wisdom in Solomon, generosity in David, patience in Job, knowledge of things to come in Daniel faith in Peter, zeal in Phinehas and Paul, virginity in John, and other virtues in others. But when the end of all things shall come, then shall He be all in all, for then the saints shall severally possess all the virtues and all will possess Christ in His entirety.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":3,"verse":66,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"757","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"And lastly cruel death doth claim his prey.[fn-26-P2614_675048:1873-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":3,"verse":28,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"868","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"2. Wherefore, though you are already running in the way, I urge a willing horse, as the saying goes, and implore you, while you regret in your Lucinius a true brother, to rejoice as well that he now reigns with Christ.

But why do we delay any longer to stop their mouths by another most clear and most weighty proof, where not an angel in the singular nor men in the plural are spoken of, but simply angels; by whom not any particular word was wrought, but the Law itself is most distinctly declared to be given; which certainly none of the faithful doubts that God gave to Moses for the control of the children of Israel, or yet, that it was given by angels. So Stephen speaks: \"Ye stiff-necked,\" he says, \"and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye. Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers: who have received the Law by the disposition of angels,[fn-7-P787_304747:79-nf] and have not kept it.\"[fn-7-P788_304797:80-nf] What is more evident than this? What more strong than such an authority? The Law, indeed, was given to that people by the disposition of angels; but the advent of our Lord Jesus Christ was by it prepared and pre-announced; and He Himself, as the Word of God, was in some wonderful and unspeakable manner in the angels, by whose disposition the Law itself was given. And hence He said in the Gospel, \"For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me.\"[fn-7-P789_305294:81-nf] Therefore then the Lord was speaking by the angels; and the son of God, who was to be the Mediator of God and men, from the seed of Abraham, was preparing His own advent by the angels, that He might find some by whom He would be received, confessing themselves guilty, whom the Law unfulfilled had made transgressors. And hence the apostle also says to the Galatians, \"Wherefore then serveth the Law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made, which [seed] was ordered[fn-7-P790_305833:82-nf] through angels in the hand of a mediator;\"[fn-7-P791_305893:83-nf] that is, ordered through angels in His own hand.

They were founded probably at a very early period, but were greatly enlarged and augmented by a devout man whose name was Ammoun. In his youth this person had an aversion to matrimony; but when some of his relatives urged him not to contemn marriage, but to take a wife to himself, he was prevailed upon and was married. On leading the bride with the customary ceremonies from the banquet-room to the nuptial couch, after their mutual friends had withdrawn, he took a book[fn-13-P1390_599387:50-nf] containing the epistles of the apostles and read to his wife Paul's Epistle to the Corinthians, explaining to her the apostle's admonitions to married persons.[fn-13-P1391_599873:51-nf] Adducing many external considerations besides, he descanted on the inconveniences and discomforts attending matrimonial intercourse, the pangs of child-bearing, and the trouble and anxiety connected with rearing a family. He contrasted with all this the advantages of chastity; described the liberty, and immaculate purity of a life of continence; and affirmed that virginity places persons in the nearest relation to the Deity. By these and other arguments of a similar kind, he persuaded his virgin bride to renounce with him a secular life, prior to their having any conjugal knowledge of each other. Having taken this resolution, they retired together to the mountain of Nitria, and in a hut there inhabited for a short time one common ascetic apartment, without regarding their difference of sex, being according to the apostles, `one in Christ.'[fn-13-P1392_600750:52-nf] But not long after, the recent and unpolluted bride thus addressed Ammoun: `It is unsuitable,' said she, `for you who practice chastity, to look upon a woman in so confined a dwelling; let us therefore, if it is agreeable to you, perform our exercise apart.' This agreement again was satisfactory to both, and so they separated, and spent the rest of their lives in abstinence from wine and oil, eating dry bread alone, sometimes passing over one day, at others fasting two, and sometimes more. Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, asserts in his Life of Anthony,[fn-13-P1393_601461:53-nf] that the subject of his memoir who was contemporary with this Ammoun, saw his soul taken up by angels after his decease. Accordingly, a great number of persons emulated Ammoun's manner of life, so that by degrees the mountains of Nitria and Scitis were filled with monks, an account of whose lives would require an express work. As, however, there were among them persons of eminent piety, distinguished for their strict discipline and apostolic lives, who said and did many things worthy of being recorded, I deem it useful to interweave with my history a few particulars selected out of the great number for the information of my readers. It is said that Ammoun never saw himself naked, being accustomed to say that `it became not a monk to see even his own person exposed.' And when once he wanted to pass a river, but was unwilling to undress, he besought God to enable him to cross without his being obliged to break his resolution; and immediately an angel transported him to the other side of the river. Another monk named Didymus[fn-13-P1394_602529:54-nf] lived entirely alone to the day of his death, although he had reached the age of ninety years. Arsenius, another of them, would not separate young delinquents from communion, but only those that were advanced in age: `for,' said he, `when a young person is excommunicated he becomes hardened; but an elderly one is soon sensible of the misery of excommunication.' Pior was accustomed to take his food as he walked along. As a certain one asked him, `Why do you eat thus?' `That I may not seem,' said he, `to make eating serious business but rather a thing done by the way.' To another putting the same question he replied, `Lest even in eating my mind should be sensible of corporeal enjoyment.' Isidore affirmed that he had not been conscious of sin even in thought for forty years; and that he had never consented either to lust or anger. Pambos being an illiterate man went to some one for the purpose of being taught a psalm; and having heard the first verse of the thirty-eighth psalm, `I said I will take heed to my ways, that I offend not with my tongue,'[fn-13-P1395_603612:55-nf] he departed without staying to hear the second verse, saying, `this one will suffice, if I can practically acquire it.' And when the person who had given him the verse reproved him because he had not seen him for the space of six months, he answered that he had not yet learnt to practice the verse of the psalm. After a considerable lapse of time, being asked by one of his friends whether he had made himself master of the verse, his answer was, `I have scarcely succeeded in accomplishing it during nineteen years.' A certain individual having placed gold in his hands for distribution to the poor, requested him to reckon what he had given him. `There is no need of counting,' said he, `but of integrity of mind.' This same Pambos, at the desire of Athanasius the bishop, came out of the desert to Alexandria and on beholding an actress there, he wept. When those present asked him why he wept, he replied, `Two causes have affected me: one is the destruction of this woman; the other is that I exert myself less to please my God than she does to please obscene characters.' Another said that `a monk who did not work ought to be regarded as on a level with the covetous man.' Piterus was well-informed in many branches of natural philosophy, and was accustomed frequently to enter into expositions of the principles sometimes of one and sometimes of another department of science, but he always commenced his expositions with prayer. There were also among the monks of that period, two of the same name, of great sanctity, each being called Macarius; one of whom was from Upper Egypt, the other from the city of Alexandria. Both were celebrated for their ascetic discipline, the purity of their life and conversation, and the miracles which were wrought by their hands. The Egyptian Macarius performed so many cures, and cast out so many devils, that it would require a distinct treatise to record all that the grace of God enabled him to do. His manner toward those who resorted to him was austere, yet at the same time calculated to inspire veneration. The Alexandrian Macarius, while in all respects resembling his Egyptian namesake, differed from him in this, that he was always cheerful to his visitors; and by the affability of his manners led many young men to asceticism. Evagrius[fn-13-P1396_605933:56-nf] became a disciple of these men, acquired from them the philosophy of deeds, whereas he had previously known that which consisted in words only. He was ordained deacon at Constantinople by Gregory of Nazianzus, and afterwards went with him into Egypt, where he became acquainted with these eminent persons, and emulated their course of conduct, and miracles were done by his hands as numerous and important as those of his preceptors. Books were also composed by him of very valuable nature, one of which is entitled The Monk, or, On Active Virtue; another The Gnostic,[fn-13-P1397_606654:57-nf] or, To him who is deemed worthy of Knowledge: this book is divided into fifty chapters. A third is designated Antirrheticus, and contains selections from the Holy Scriptures against tempting spirits, distributed into eight parts, according to the number of the arguments. He wrote moreover Six Hundred Prognostic Problems, and also two compositions in verse, one addressed To the Monks living in Communities, and the other To the Virgin. Whoever shall read these productions will be convinced of their excellence. It will not be out of place here, I conceive, to subjoin to what has been before stated, a few things mentioned by him respecting the monks. These are his words:[fn-13-P1398_607409:58-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Socrates Scholasticus"},{"chapter":3,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_13_book_iii_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"72","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But even in the passage to the Corinthians, where he had been treating fully of the resurrection, the apostle concludes his statement in such a way as not to permit us to doubt that the death of the body is the result of sin. Forafter he had said, \"This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality: so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal immortality, then,\" he added, \"shall be brought to pass the saying which is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?\" and at last he subjoined these words: \"The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.\"[fn-12-P1219_630773:43-nf] Now, because (as the apostle's words most plainly declare) death shall then be swallowed up in victory when this corruptible and mortal shall have put on incorruption and immortality,-that is, when \"God shall quicken even our mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in us,\"-it manifestly follows that the sting of the body of this death, which is the contrary of the resurrection of the body, is sin. The sting, however, is that by which death was made, and not that which death made, since it is by sin that we die, and not by death that we sin. It is therefore called \"the sting of death\" on the principle which originated the phrase \"the tree of life,\" -not because the life of man produced it, but because by it the life of man was made. In like manner \"the tree of knowledge\" was that whereby man's knowledge was made, not that which man made by his knowledge. So also \"the sting of death\" is that by which death was produced, not that which death made. We similarly use the expression \"the cup of death,\" since by it some one has died, or might die, -not meaning, of course, a cup made by a dying or dead man.[fn-12-P1220_631915:44-nf] The sting of death is therefore sin, because by the puncture of sin the human race has been slain. Why ask further: the deathof what, - whether of the soul, or of the body? Whether the first which we are all of us now dying, or the second which the wicked hereafter shall die? There is no occasion for plying the question so curiously; there is no room for subterfuge. The words in which the apostle expresses the case answer the questions: \"When this mortal,\" says he, \"shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying which is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting? The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law.\" He was treating of the resurrection of the body, wherein death shall be swallowed up in victory, when this mortal shall have put on immortality. Then over death itself shall be raised the shout of triumph, when at the resurrection of the body it shall be swallowed up in victory; then shall be said to it, \"O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?\" To the death ofthe body, therefore, is this said. For victorious immortality shall swallow it up, when this mortal shall put on immortality. I repeat it, to the death of the body shall it be said, \"Where is thy victory?\" - that victory in which thou didst conquer all, so that even the Son of God engaged in conflict with thee, and by not shrinking but grappling with thee overcame. In thesethat die thou hast conquered; but thou art thyself conquered in these that rise again. Thy victory was but temporal, in which thou didst swallow up the bodies of them that die. Our victory will abide eternal, in which thou art swallowed up in the bodies of them that rise again. \"Where is thy sting? \"-that is, the sin wherewithal we are punctured and poisoned, so that thou didst fix thyself in our very bodies, and for so long a time didst hold them in possession. \"The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law.\" We all sinned in one, so that we all die in one; we received the law, not by amendment according to its precepts to put an end to sin, but by transgression to increase it. For \"the law entered that sin might abound;\"[fn-12-P1221_634421:45-nf] and \"the Scripture hath concluded all under sin;\"[fn-12-P1222_634488:46-nf] but \"thanks be to God, who hath given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ,\"[fn-12-P1223_634592:47-nf] in order that \"where sin abounded, grace might much more abound; \"[fn-12-P1224_634679:48-nf] and \"that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe;\"[fn-12-P1225_634781:49-nf] and that we might overcome death by a deathless resurrection, and sin, \"the sting\" thereof, by a free justification.","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_13_book_iii_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"72","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But even in the passage to the Corinthians, where he had been treating fully of the resurrection, the apostle concludes his statement in such a way as not to permit us to doubt that the death of the body is the result of sin. Forafter he had said, \"This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality: so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal immortality, then,\" he added, \"shall be brought to pass the saying which is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.

O death, where is thy sting?\" and at last he subjoined these words: \"The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.\"[fn-12-P1219_630773:43-nf] Now, because (as the apostle's words most plainly declare) death shall then be swallowed up in victory when this corruptible and mortal shall have put on incorruption and immortality,-that is, when \"God shall quicken even our mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in us,\"-it manifestly follows that the sting of the body of this death, which is the contrary of the resurrection of the body, is sin. The sting, however, is that by which death was made, and not that which death made, since it is by sin that we die, and not by death that we sin. It is therefore called \"the sting of death\" on the principle which originated the phrase \"the tree of life,\" -not because the life of man produced it, but because by it the life of man was made. In like manner \"the tree of knowledge\" was that whereby man's knowledge was made, not that which man made by his knowledge. So also \"the sting of death\" is that by which death was produced, not that which death made. We similarly use the expression \"the cup of death,\" since by it some one has died, or might die, -not meaning, of course, a cup made by a dying or dead man.[fn-12-P1220_631915:44-nf] The sting of death is therefore sin, because by the puncture of sin the human race has been slain.

For the reason why He recalls that young man who was hastening to his father's obsequies,[fn-11-P1159_302592:61-nf] is that He may show that we are called priests by Him; (priests) whom the Law used to forbid to be present at the sepulture of parents:[fn-11-P1160_302770:62-nf] \"Over every dead soul,\" it says, \"the priest shall not enter, and over his own father and over his own mother he shall not be contaminated.\" \"Does it follow that we too are bound to observe this prohibition? \"No, of course.

Therefore a wife, when her husband is dead, will not marry; for if she marry, she will of course be marrying (his) brother: for \"all we are brethren.\"[fn-11-P1149_300212:51-nf] Again, the woman, if intending to marry, has to marry \"in the Lord; \"[fn-11-P1150_300303:52-nf] that is, not to an heathen, but to a brother, inasmuch as even the ancient law forbids[fn-11-P1151_300411:53-nf] marriage with members of another tribe. Since, moreover, even in Leviticus there is a caution, \"Whoever shall have taken (his) brother's wife, (it) is uncleanness-turpitude; without children shall (he) die; \"[fn-11-P1152_300702:54-nf] beyond doubt, while the man is prohibited from marrying a second time, the woman is prohibited too, having no one to marry except a brother. In what way, then, an agreement shall be established between the apostle and the Law (which he is not impugning in its entirety), shall be shown when we shall have come to his own epistle. Meantime, so far as pertains to the law, the lines of argument drawn from it are more suitable for us (than for our opponents). In short, the same (law) prohibits priests from marrying a second time. The daughter also of a priest it bids, if widowed or repudiated, if she have had no seed, to return into her father's home and be nourished from his bread.[fn-11-P1153_301425:55-nf] The reason why (it is said), \"If she have had no seed,\" is not that if she have she may marry again-for how much more will she abstain from marrying if she have sons?-but that, if she have, she may be \"nourished\" by her son rather than by her father; in order that the son, too, may carry out the precept of God, \"Honour father and mother.\"[fn-11-P1154_301870:56-nf] Us, moreover, Jesus, the Father's Highest and Great Priest,[fn-11-P1155_301956:57-nf] clothing us from His own store[fn-11-P1156_302153:58-nf] -inasmuch as they \"who are baptized in Christ[fn-11-P1157_302352:59-nf] have put on Christ\"-has made \"priests to God His Father,\"[fn-11-P1158_302463:60-nf] according to John. For the reason why He recalls that young man who was hastening to his father's obsequies,[fn-11-P1159_302592:61-nf] is that He may show that we are called priests by Him; (priests) whom the Law used to forbid to be present at the sepulture of parents:[fn-11-P1160_302770:62-nf] \"Over every dead soul,\" it says, \"the priest shall not enter, and over his own father and over his own mother he shall not be contaminated.\" \"Does it follow that we too are bound to observe this prohibition? \"No, of course. For our one Father, God, lives, and our mother, the Church; and neither are we dead who live to God, nor do we bury our dead, inasmuch as they too are living in Christ. At all events, priests we are called by Christ; debtors to monogamy, in accordance with the pristine Law of God, which prophesied at that time of us in its own priests.","title":"VI.

For how can it be that \"the law is good, if a man use it lawfully,\" if what follows is also true: \"Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man?\"[fn-13-P1363_675512:56-nf] For who but a righteous man lawfully uses the law? Yet it is not for him that it is made, but for the unrighteous. Must then the unrighteous man, in order that he may be justified,- that is, become a righteous man,- lawfully use the law, to lead him, as by the schoolmaster's hand,[fn-13-P1364_675812:57-nf] to that grace by which alone he can fulfil what the law commands? Now it is freely that he is justified thereby,-that is, on account of no antecedent merits of his own works; \"otherwise grace is no more grace,\"[fn-13-P1365_676042:58-nf] since it is bestowed on us, not because we have done good works, but that we may be able to do them,- in other words, not because we have fulfilled the law, but in order that we may be able to fulfil the law. Now He said, \"I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil it,\"[fn-13-P1366_676335:59-nf] of whom it was said, \"We have seen His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.\"[fn-13-P1367_676474:60-nf] This is the glory which is meant in the words, \"All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;\"[fn-13-P1368_676593:61-nf] and this the grace of which he speaks in the next verse, \"Being justified freely by His grace.\"[fn-13-P1369_676709:62-nf] The unrighteous man therefore lawfully uses the law, that he may become righteous; but when he has become so, he must no longer use it as a chariot, for he has arrived at his journey's end,- or rather (that I may employ the apostle's own simile, which has been already mentioned) as a schoolmaster, seeing that he is now fully learned. How then is the law not made for a righteous man, if it is necessary for the righteous man too, not that hemay be brought as an unrighteous man to the grace that justifies, but that he may use it lawfully, now that he is righteous? Does not the case perhaps stand thus, -nay, not perhaps, but rather certainly,- that the man who is become righteous thus lawfully uses the law, when he applies it to alarm the unrighteous, so that whenever the disease of some unusual desire begins in them, too, to be augmented by the incentive of the law's prohibition and an increased amount of transgression, they may in faith flee for refuge to the grace that justifies, and becoming delighted with the sweet pleasures of holiness, may escape the penalty of the law's menacing letter through the spirit's soothing gift? In this way the two statements will not be contrary, nor will they be repugnant to each other: even the righteous man may lawfully use a good law, and yet the law be not made for the righteous man; for it is not by the law that he becomes righteous, but by the law of faith, which led him to believe that no other resource was possible to his weakness for fulfilling the precepts which \"the law of works\"[fn-13-P1370_678276:63-nf] commanded, except to be assisted by the grace of God.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_14_on_the_spirit_and_the_letter","source_chapter":33,"source_paragraph":"133","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Now, since, as he says in another passage, \"the law was added because of transgression,\"[fn-14-P1481_711213:129-nf] meaning the law which is written externally to man, he therefore designates it both as \"the ministration of death,\"[fn-14-P1482_711350:130-nf] and \"the ministration of condemnation;\"[fn-14-P1483_711412:131-nf] but the other, that is, the law of the New Testament, he calls \"the ministration of the Spirit\"[fn-14-P1484_711530:132-nf] and \"the ministration of righteousness,\"[fn-14-P1485_711593:133-nf] because through the Spirit we work righteousness, and are delivered from the condemnation due to transgression. The one, therefore, vanishes away, the other abides; for the terrifying schoolmaster will be dispensed with, when love has succeeded to fear. Now \"where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.\"[fn-14-P1486_711926:134-nf] But that this ministration is vouchsafed to us, not on account of our deserving, but from His mercy, the apostle thus declares: \"Seeing then that we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, let us faint not; but let us renounce the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor adulterating the word of God with deceit.\"[fn-14-P1487_712290:135-nf] By this \"craftiness\" and \"deceitfulness\" he would have us understand the hypocrisy with which the arrogant would fain be supposed to be righteous. Whence in the psalm, which the apostle cites in testimony of this grace of God, it is said, \"Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin, and in whose mouth is no guile.\"[fn-14-P1488_712644:136-nf] This is the confession of lowly saints, who do not boast to be what they are not. Then, in a passage which follows not long after, the apostle writes thus: \"For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake. For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.\"[fn-14-P1489_713094:137-nf] This is the knowledge of His glory, whereby we know that He is the light which illumines our darkness.

But if they have not continency, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.\" Let us turn back to the chief point of the evidence: \"It is good,\" he says, \"for a man not to touch a woman.\" If it is good not to touch a woman, it is bad to touch one: for there is no opposite to goodness but badness. But if it be bad and the evil is pardoned, the reason for the concession is to prevent worse evil. But surely a thing which is only allowed because there may be something worse has only a slight degree of goodness. He would never have added \"let each man have his own wife,\" unless he had previously used the words \"but, because of fornications.\" Do away with fornication, and he will not say \"let each man have his own wife.\" Just as though one were to lay it down: \"It is good to feed on wheaten bread, and to eat the finest wheat flour,\" and yet to prevent a person pressed by hunger from devouring cow-dung, I may allow, him to eat barley. Does it follow that the wheat will not have its peculiar purity, because such an one prefers barley to excrement? That is naturally good which does not admit of comparison with what is bad, and is not eclipsed because something else is preferred. At the same time we must notice the Apostle's prudence. He did not say, it is good not to have a wife: but, it is good not to touch a woman: as though there were danger even in the touch: as though he who touched her, would not escape from her who \"hunteth for the precious life,\" who causeth the young man's understanding to fly away.[fn-61-P6178_1858076:38-nf] \"Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? Or can one walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?\" As then he who touches fire is instantly burned, so by the mere touch the peculiar nature of man and woman is perceived, and the difference of sex is understood, Heathen fables relate how[fn-61-P6179_1858426:39-nf] Mithras and[fn-61-P6180_1858584:40-nf] Ericthonius were begotten of the soil, in stone or earth, by raging lust. Hence it was that our Joseph, because the Egyptian woman wished to touch him, fled from her hands, and, as if he had been bitten by a mad dog and feared the spreading poison, threw away the cloak which she had touched. \"But, because of fornications let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.\" He did not say, because of fornication let each man marry a wife: otherwise by this excuse he would have thrown the reins to lust, and whenever a man's wife died, he would have to marry another to prevent fornication, but \"have his own wife.\" Let him he says have and use his own wife, whom he had before he became a believer, and whom it would have been good not to touch, and, when once he became a follower of Christ, to know only as a sister, not as a wife unless fornication should make it excusable to touch her. \"The wife hath not power over her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power over his own body, but the wife.\" The whole question here concerns those who are married men. Is it lawful for them to do what our Lord forbade in the Gospel, and to put away their wives? Whence it is that the Apostle says, \"It is good for a man not to touch a woman.\" But inasmuch as he who is once married has no power to abstain except by mutual consent, and may not reject an unoffending partner, let the husband render unto the wife her due. He bound himself voluntarily that he might be under compulsion to render it. \"Defraud ye not one the other, except it be by consent for a season, that ye may give yourselves unto prayer.\" What, I pray you, is the quality of that good thing which hinders prayer? which does not allow the body of Christ to be received? So long as I do the husband's part, I fail in continency. The same Apostle in another place commands us to pray always. If we are to pray always, it follows that we must never be in the bondage of wedlock, for as often as I render my wife her due, I cannot pray. The Apostle Peter had experience of the bonds of marriage. See how he fashions the Church, and what lesson he teaches Christians:[fn-61-P6181_1860965:41-nf] \"Ye husbands in like manner dwell with your wives according to knowledge, giving honour unto the woman, as unto the weaker vessel, as being also joint-heirs of the grace of life; to the end that your prayers be not hindered.\" Observe that, as S. Paul before, because in both cases the spirit is the same, so S. Peter now, says that prayers are hindered by the performance of marriage duty. When he says \"likewise,\" he challenges the husbands to imitate their wives, because he has already given them commandment:[fn-61-P6182_1861498:42-nf] \"beholding your chaste conversation coupled with fear. Whose adorning let it not be the outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on apparel: but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.\" You see what kind of wedlock he enjoins. Husbands and wives are to dwell together according to knowledge, so that they may know what God wishes and desires, and give honour to the weak vessel, woman. If we abstain from intercourse, we give honour to our wives: if we do not abstain, it is clear that insult is the opposite of honour. He also tells the wives to let their husbands \"see their chaste behaviour, and the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit.\" Words truly worthy of an apostle, and of Christ's rock! He lays down the law for husbands and wives, condemns outward ornament, while he praises continence, which is the ornament of the inner man, as seen in the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit. In effect he says this: Since your outer man is corrupt, and you have ceased to possess the blessing of incorruption characteristic of virgins, at least imitate the incorruption of the spirit by subsequent abstinence, and what you cannot show in the body exhibit in the mind. For these are the riches, and these the ornaments of your union, which Christ seeks.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":3,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_10_book_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"52","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"38.

And no nation to which the knowledge of it has already come, or may hereafter come, ought to demand, Why so soon? or, Why so late?-for the design of Him who sends it is impenetrable by human capacity. This was felt by Porphyry when he confined himself to saying that this gift of God was not yet received, and had not yet come to his knowledge. For though this was so, he did not on that account pronounce that the way itself had no existence. This, I say, is the universal way for the deliverance of believers, concerning which the faithful Abraham received the divine assurance, \"In thy seed shall all nations be blessed.\"[fn-17-P1768_1012750:71-nf] He, indeed, was by birth a Chaldaean; but, that he might receive these great promises, and that there might be propagated from him a seed \"disposed by angels in the hand of a Mediator,\"[fn-17-P1769_1012957:72-nf] in whom this universal way, thrown open to all nations for the deliverance of the soul, might be found, he was ordered to leave his country, and kindred, and father's house. Then was he himself, first of all, delivered from the Chaldaean superstitions, and by his obedience worshipped the one true God, whose promises he faithfully trusted. This is the universal way, of which it is said in holy prophecy, \"God be merciful unto us, and bless us, and cause His face to shine upon us; that Thy way may be known upon earth, Thy saving health among all nations.\"[fn-17-P1770_1013535:73-nf] And hence, when our Saviour, so long after, had taken flesh of the seed of Abraham, He says of Himself, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life.\"[fn-17-P1771_1013702:74-nf] This is the universal way, of which so long before it had been predicted, \"And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and He will teach us of His ways, and we will walk in His paths: for out of Sion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.\"[fn-17-P1772_1014271:75-nf] This way, therefore, is not the property of one, but of all nations. The law and the word of the Lord did not remain in Zion and Jerusalem, but issued thence to be universally diffused. And therefore the Mediator Himself, after His resurrection, says to His alarmed disciples, \"These are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me. Then opened He their understandings that they might understand the Scriptures, and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.\"[fn-17-P1773_1015083:76-nf] This is the universal way of the soul's deliverance, which the holy angels and the holy prophets formerly disclosed where they could among the few men who found the grace of God, and especially in the Hebrew nation, whose commonwealth was, as it were, consecrated to prefigure and fore-announce the city of God which was to be gathered from all nations, by their tabernacle, and temple, and priesthood, and sacrifices. In some explicit statements, and in many obscure foreshadowings, this way was declared; but latterly came the Mediator Himself in the flesh, and His blessed apostles, revealing how the grace of the New Testament more openly explained what had been obscurely hinted to preceding generations, in conformity with the relation of the ages of the human race, and as it pleased God in His wisdom to appoint, who also bore them witness with signs and miracles some of which I have cited above. For not only were there visions of angels, and words heard from those heavenly ministrants, but also men of God, armed with the word of simple piety, cast out unclean spirits from the bodies and senses of men, and healed deformities and sicknesses; the wild beasts of earth and sea, the birds of air, inanimate things, the elements, the stars, obeyed their divine commands; the powers of hell gave way before them, the dead were restored to life. I say nothing of the miracles peculiar and proper to the Saviour's own person, especially the nativity and the resurrection; in the one of which He wrought only the mystery of a virgin maternity, while in the other He furnished an instance of the resurrection which all shall at last experience. This way purifies the whole man, and prepares the mortal in all his parts for immortality. For, to prevent us from seeking for one purgation for the part which Porphyry calls intellectual, and another for the part he calls spiritual, and another for the body itself, our most mighty and truthful Purifier and Saviour assumed the whole human nature. Except by this way, which has been present among men both during the period of the promises and of the proclamation of their fulfillment, no man has been delivered, no man is delivered, no man shall be delivered.","title":"Book X","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":16,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_19_an_answer_to_the_jews_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"ANF-03","text":"For the occasion, indeed, of claiming Divine grace even for the Gentiles derived a pre-eminent fitness from this fact, that the man who set up to vindicate CoWs Law as his own was of the Gentiles, and not a Jew \"of the stock of the Israelites.\"[fn-20-P2029_693529:2-nf] For this fact-that Gentiles are admissible to God's Law-is enough to prevent Israel from priding himself on the notion that \"the Gentiles are accounted as a little drop of a bucket,\" or else as \"dust out of a threshing-floor: \"[fn-20-P2030_693780:3-nf] although we have God Himself as an adequate engager and faithful promiser, in that He promised to Abraham that \"in his seed should be blest all nations of the earth; \"[fn-20-P2031_694109:4-nf] and that[fn-20-P2032_694198:5-nf] out of the womb of Rebecca \"two peoples and two nations were about to proceed,\"[fn-20-P2033_694469:6-nf] -of course those of the Jews, that is, of Israel; and of the Gentiles, that is ours.

If he does here and there use some expressions favourable to devotion it is just held out as a bait to simple souls, to the end that the hook of impiety may be swallowed along with it. For after employing such language as a member of the Church might use, he subjoins, \"Obedient with regard to the creation and production of all things that are, obedient with regard to every ministration, not having by His obedience attained Sonship or Godhead, but, as a consequence of being Son and being generated as the Only-begotten God, showing Himself obedient in words, obedient in acts.\" Yet who of those who are conversant with the oracles of God does not know With regard to what point of time it was said of Him by the mighty Paul, (and that once for all), that He \"became obedient[fn-11-P1158_627368:159-nf] \"? For it was when He came in the form of a servant to accomplish the mystery of redemption by the cross, Who had emptied Himself, Who humbled Himself by assuming the likeness and fashion of a man, being found as man in man's lowly nature-then, I say, it was that He became obedient, even He Who \"took our infirmities and bare our sicknesses[fn-11-P1159_627729:160-nf] ,\" healing the disobedience of men by His own obedience, that by His stripes He might heal our wound, and by His own death do away with the common death of all men,-then it was that for our sakes He was made obedient, even as He became \"sin[fn-11-P1160_628000:161-nf] \" and \"a curse[fn-11-P1161_628036:162-nf] \" by reason of the dispensation on our behalf, not being so by nature, but becoming so in His love for man. But by what sacred utterance was He ever taught His list of so many obediences? Nay, on the contrary every inspired Scripture attests His independent and sovereign power, saying, \"He spake the word and they were made: He commanded and they were created[fn-11-P1162_628418:163-nf] \":-for it is plain that the Psalmist says this concerning Him Who upholds \"all things by the word of His power[fn-11-P1163_628552:164-nf] ,\" Whose authority, by the sole impulse of His will, framed every existence and nature, and all things in the creation apprehended by reason or by sight. Whence, then, was Eunomius moved to ascribe in such manifold wise to the King of the universe the attribute of obedience, speaking of Him as \"obedient with regard to all the work of creation, obedient with regard to every ministration, obedient in words and in acts\"? Yet it is plain to every one, that he alone is obedient to another in acts and words, who has not yet perfectly achieved in himself the condition of accurate working or unexceptionable speech, but keeping his eye ever on his teacher and guide, is trained by his suggestions to exact propriety in deed and word. But to think that Wisdom needs a master and teacher to guide aright. Its attempts at imitation, is the dream of Eunomius' fancy, and of his alone. And concerning the Father he says, that He is faithful in words and faithful in works, while of the Son he does not assert faithfulness in word and deed, but only obedience and not faithfulness, so that his profanity extends impartially through all his statements. But it is perhaps right to pass in silence over the inconsiderate folly of the assertion interposed between those last mentioned, lest some unreflecting persons should laugh at its absurdity when they ought rather to weep over the perdition of their souls, than laugh at the folly of their words. For this wise and wary theologian says that He did not attain to being a Son as the result of His obedience! Mark his penetration! with what cogent force does he lay it down for us that He was not first obedient and afterwards a Son, and that we ought not to think that His obedience was prior to His generation! Now if he had not added this defining clause, who without it would have been sufficiently silly and idiotic to fancy that His generation was bestowed on Him by His Father, as a reward of the obedience of Him Who before His generation had showed due subjection and obedience? But that no one may too readily extract matter for laughter from these remarks, let each consider that even the folly of the words has in it something worthy of tears. For what he intends to establish by these observations is something of this kind, that His obedience is part of His nature, so that not even if He willed it would it be possible for Him not to be obedient.","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":3,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"64","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Again, what is the manifold mediation which with wearying iteration he assigns to God, calling Him \"Mediator in doctrines, Mediator in the Law[fn-11-P1173_634603:170-nf] \"? It is not thus that we are taught by the lofty utterance of the Apostle, who says that having made void the law of commandments by His own doctrines, He is the mediator between God and man, declaring it by this saying, \"There is one God, and one mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus[fn-11-P1174_635014:171-nf] ;\" where by the distinction implied in the word \"mediator\" he reveals to us the whole aim of the mystery of godliness. Now the aim is this. Humanity once revolted through the malice of the enemy, and, brought into bondage to sin, was also alienated from the true Life. After this the Lord of the creature calls back to Him His own creature, and becomes Man while still remaining God, being both God and Man in the entirety of the two several natures, and thus humanity was indissolubly united to God, the Man that is in Christ conducting the work of mediation, to Whom, by the first-fruits assumed for us, all the lump is potentially united[fn-11-P1175_635681:172-nf] . Since, then, a mediator is not a mediator of one[fn-11-P1176_635756:173-nf] , and God is one, not divided among the Persons in Whom we have been taught to believe (for the Godhead in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost is one), the Lord, therefore, becomes a mediator once for all betwixt God and men, binding man to the Deity by Himself. But even by the idea of a mediator we are taught the godly doctrine enshrined in the Creed. For the Mediator between God and man entered as it were into fellowship with human nature, not by being merely deemed a man, but having truly become so: in like manner also, being very God, He has not, as Eunomius will have us consider, been honouredby the bare title of Godhead.","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":3,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_18_concerning_man_s_perfection_in_righteousness","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"77","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"XI. \"The next question which must be put,\" he says, \"is, in how many ways all sin is manifested? In two, if I mistake not: if either those things are done which are forbidden, or those things are not done which are commanded. Now, it is just as certain that all things which are forbidden are able to be avoided, as it is that all things which are commanded are able to be effected. For it is vain either to forbid or to enjoin that which cannot either be guarded against or accomplished. And how shall we deny the possibility of man's being without sin, when we are compelled to admit that he can as well avoid all those things which are forbidden, as do all those which are commanded?\" My answer is, that in the Holy Scriptures there are many divine precepts, to mention the whole of which would be too laborious; but the Lord, who on earth consummated and abridged[fn-24-P2457_997628:25-nf] His word, expressly declared that the law and the prophets hung on two commandments,[fn-24-P2458_997749:26-nf] that we might understand that whatever else has been enjoined on us by God ends in these two commandments, and must be referred to them: \"Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind;\"[fn-24-P2459_998008:27-nf] and \"Thou shall love thy neighbouras thyself.\"[fn-24-P2460_998076:28-nf] \"On these two commandments,\" says He, \"hang all the law and the prophets.\"[fn-24-P2461_998173:29-nf] Whatever, therefore, we are by God's law forbidden, and whatever we are bidden to do, we are forbidden and bidden with the direct object of fulfilling these two commandments. And perhaps the general prohibition is, \"Thou shalt not covet;\"[fn-24-P2462_998433:30-nf] and the general precept, \"Thou shall love.\"[fn-24-P2463_998494:31-nf] Accordingly the Apostle Paul, in a certain place, briefly embraced the two, expressing the prohibition in these words, \"Be not conformed to this world,\"[fn-24-P2464_998665:32-nf] and the command in these, \"But be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.\"[fn-24-P2465_998763:33-nf] The former falls under the negative precept, not to covet; the latter under the positive one, to love. The one has reference to continence, the other to righteousness. The one enjoins avoidance of evil; the other, pursuit of good. By eschewing covetousness we put off the old man, and by showing love we put on the new. But no, man can be continent unless God endow him with the gift;[fn-24-P2466_999166:34-nf] nor is God's love shed abroad in our hearts by our own selves, but by the Holy Ghost that is given to us.[fn-24-P2467_999293:35-nf] This, however, takes place day after day in those who advance by willing, believing, and praying, and who, \"forgetting those things which are behind, reach forth unto those things which are before.\"[fn-24-P2468_999508:36-nf] For the reason why the law inculcates all these precepts is, that when a man has failed in fulfilling them, he may not be swollen with pride, and so exalt himself, but may in very weariness betake himself to grace. Thus the law fulfils its office as\" schoolmaster,\" so terrifying the man as \"to lead him to Christ,\" to give Him his love.[fn-24-P2469_999866:37-nf] ","title":"Concerning Man's Perfection in Righteousness","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_18_concerning_man_s_perfection_in_righteousness","source_chapter":32,"source_paragraph":"139","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"He, however, thought he had discovered a great support for his cause in the prophet Isaiah; because by him God said: \"If ye be willing, and hearken unto me, ye shall eat the good of the land; but if ye be not willing, and hearken. not to me, the sword shall devour you: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken this.\"[fn-27-P2745_1068814:221-nf] As if the entire law were not full of conditions of this sort; or as if its commandments had been given to proud men for any other reason than that \"the law was added because of transgression, until the seed should come to whom the promise was made.\"[fn-27-P2746_1069088:222-nf] \"It entered, therefore, that the offence might abound; but where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.\"[fn-27-P2747_1069217:223-nf] In other words, That man might receive commandments, trusting as he did in his own resources, and that, failing in these and becoming a transgressor, he might ask for a deliverer and a saviour; and that the fear of the law might humble him, and bring him, as a schoolmaster, to faith and grace.

For any one who either does not recollect, or does not sufficiently weigh, the language of sacred Scripture, may, on first hearing what we have said, suppose that the Epicurean philosophers live after the flesh, because they place man's highest good in bodily pleasure; and that those others do so who have been of opinion that in some form or other bodily good is man's supreme good; and that the mass of men do so who, without dogmatizing or philosophizing on the subject, are so prone to lust that they cannot delight in any pleasure save such as they receive from bodily sensations: and he may suppose that the Stoics, who place the supreme good of men in the soul, live after the spirit; for what is man's soul, if not spirit? But in the sense of the divine Scripture both are proved to live after the flesh. For by flesh it means not only the body of a terrestrial and mortal animal, as when it says, \"All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, another of birds,\"[fn-22-P2283_1303716:2-nf] but it uses this word in many other significations; and among these various usages, a frequent one is to use flesh for man himself, the nature of man taking the part for the whole, as in the words, \"By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified;\"[fn-22-P2284_1303994:3-nf] for what does he mean here by \"no flesh\" but \"no man?\" And this, indeed, he shortly after says more plainly: \"No man shall be justified by the law;\"[fn-22-P2285_1304161:4-nf] and in the Epistle to the Galatians, \"Knowing that man is not justified by the works of the law.\" And so we understand the words, \"And the Word was made flesh,\"[fn-22-P2286_1304339:5-nf] -that is, man, which some not accepting in its right sense, have supposed that Christ had not a human soul.[fn-22-P2287_1304463:6-nf] For as the whole is used for the part in the words of Mary Magdalene in the Gospel, \"They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him,\"[fn-22-P2288_1304642:7-nf] by which she meant only the flesh of Christ, which she supposed had been taken from the tomb where it had been buried, so the part is used for the whole, flesh being named, while man is referred to, as in the quotations above cited.","title":"Book XIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_23_ix_de_fuga_in_persecutione_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"ANF-04","text":"12. So far, my brother, as the question proposed by you is concerned, you have our opinion in answer and encouragement. But he who inquires whether persecution ought to be shunned by us must now be prepared to consider the following question also: Whether, if we should not flee from it, we should at least buy ourselves off from it. Going further than you expected, therefore, I will also on this point give you my advice, distinctly affirming that persecution, from which it is evident we must not flee, must in like manner not even be bought off. The difference lies in the payment; but as flight is a buying off without money, so buying off is money-flight. Assuredly you have here too the counselling of fear. Because you fear, you buy yourself off; and so you flee. As regards your feet, you have stood; in respect of the money you have paid, you have run away. Why, in this very standing of yours there was a fleeing from persecution, in the release from persecution which you bought; but that you should ransom with money a man whom Christ has ransomed with His blood, how unworthy is it of God and His ways of acting, who spared not His own Son for you, that He might be made a curse for us, because cursed is he that hangeth on a tree,[fn-19-P1990_603475:47-nf] -Him who was led as a sheep to be a sacrifice, and just as a lamb before its shearer, so opened He not His mouth;[fn-19-P1991_603623:48-nf] but gave His back to the scourges, nay, His cheeks to the hands of the smiter, and turned not away His face from spitting, and, being numbered with the transgressors, was delivered up to death, nay, the death of the cross. All this took place that He might redeem us from our sins. The sun ceded to us the day of our redemption; hell re-transferred the right it had in us, and our covenant is in heaven; the everlasting gates were lifted up, that the King of Glory, the Lord of might, might enter in,[fn-19-P1992_604143:49-nf] after having redeemed man from earth, nay, from hell, that he might attain to heaven. What, now, are we to think of the man who strives against that glorious One, nay, slights and defiles His goods, obtained at so great a ransom-no less, in truth, than His most precious blood? It appears, then, that it is better to flee than to fall in value, if a man will not lay out for himself as much as he cost Christ. And the Lord indeed ransomed him from the angelic powers which rule the world-from the spirits of wickedness, from the darkness of this life, from eternal judgment, from everlasting death. But you bargain for him with an informer, or a soldier or some paltry thief of a ruler-under, as they say, the folds of the tunic-as if he were stolen goods whom Christ purchased in the face of the whole world, yes, and set at liberty. Will you value, then, this free man at any price, and possess him at any price, but the one, as we have said, it cost the Lord,-namely, His own blood? (And if not,) why then do you purchase Christ in the man in whom He dwells, as though He were some human property? No otherwise did Simon even try to do, when he offered the apostles money for the Spirit of Christ. Therefore this man also, who in buying himself has bought the Spirit of Christ, will hear that word, \"Your money perish with you, since you have thought that the grace of God is to be had at a price!\"[fn-19-P1993_605563:50-nf] Yet who will despise him for being (what he is), a denier? For what says that extorter? Give me money: assuredly that he may not deliver him up, since he tries to sell you nothing else than that which he is going to give you for money. When you put that into his hands, it is certainly your wish not to be delivered up. But not delivered up, had you to be held up to public ridicule? While, then, in being unwilling to be delivered up, you are not willing to be thus exposed; by this unwillingness of yours you have denied that you are what you have been unwilling to have it made public that you are. Nay, you say, While I am unwilling to be held up to the public as being what I am, I have acknowledged that I am what I am unwilling to be so held up as being, that is, a Christian. Can Christ, therefore, claim that you, as a witness for Him, have stedfastly shown Him forth? He who buys himself off does nothing in that way. Before one it might, I doubt not, be said, You have confessed Him; so also, on the account of your unwillingness to confess Him before many you have denied Him. A man's very safety will pronounce that he has fallen while getting out of persecution's way. He has fallen, therefore, whose desire has been to escape. The refusal of martyrdom is denial. A Christian is preserved by his wealth, and for this end has his treasures, that he may not suffer, while he will be rich toward God. But it is the case that Christ was rich in blood for him. Blessed therefore are the poor, because, He says, the kingdom of heaven is theirs who have the soul only treasured up.[fn-19-P1994_607173:51-nf] If we cannot serve God and mammon, can we be redeemed both by God and by mammon? For who will serve mammon more than the man whom mammon has ransomed? Finally, of what example do you avail yourself to warrant your averting by money the giving of you up? When did the apostles, dealing with the matter, in any time of persecution trouble, extricate themselves by money? And money they certainly had from the prices of lands which were laid down at their feet,[fn-19-P1995_607649:52-nf] there being, without a doubt, many of the rich among those who believed-men, and also women, who were wont, too, to minister to their comfort. When did Onesimus, or Aquila, or Stephen,[fn-19-P1996_607856:53-nf] give them aid of this kind when they were persecuted? Paul indeed, when Felix the governor hoped that he should receive money for him from the disciples,[fn-19-P1997_608052:54-nf] about which matter he also dealt with the apostle in private, certainly neither paid it himself, nor did the disciples for him. Those disciples, at any rate. who wept because he was equally persistent in his determination to go to Jerusalem, and neglectful of all means to secure himself from the persecutions which had been foretold as about to occur there, at last say, \"Let the will of the Lord be done.\" What was that will? No doubt that he should suffer for the name of the Lord, not that he should be bought off. For as Christ laid down His life for us, so, too, we should do for Him; and not only for the Lord Himself, nay, but likewise for our brethren on His account. This, too, is the teaching of John when he declares, not that we should pay for our brethren, but rather that we should die for them. It makes no difference whether the thing not to be done by you is to buy off a Christian, or to buy one. And so the will of God accords with this. Look at the condition-certainly of God's ordaining, in whose hand the king's heart is-of kingdoms and empires. For increasing the treasury there are daily provided so many appliances-registerings of property, taxes in kind benevolences, taxes in money; but never up to this time has ought of the kind been provided by bringing Christians under some purchase-money for the person and the sect, although enormous gains could be reaped from numbers too great for any to be ignorant of them. Bought with blood, paid for with blood, we owe no money for our head, because Christ is our Head. It is not fit that Christ should cost us money. How could martyrdoms, too, take place to the glory of the Lord, if by tribute we should pay for the liberty of our sect? And so he who stipulates to have it at a price, opposes the divine appointment. Since, therefore, Caesar has imposed nothing on us after this fashion of a tributary sect-in fact, such an imposition never can be made,-with Antichrist now close at hand, and gaping for the blood, not for the money of Christians-how can it be pointed out to me that there is the command, \"Render to Caesar the things which are Caesar's? \"[fn-19-P1998_610207:55-nf] A soldier, be he an informer or an enemy, extorts money from me by threats, exacting nothing on Caesar's behalf; nay, doing the very opposite, when for a bribe he lets me go-Christian as I am, and by the laws of man a criminal. Of another sort is the denarius which I owe to Caesar, a thing belonging to him, about which the question then was started, it being a tribute coin due indeed by those subject to tribute, not by children. Or how shall I render to God the things which are God's,-certainly, therefore, His own likeness and money inscribed with His name, that is, a Christian man? But what do I owe God, as I do Caesar the denarius, but the blood which His own Son shed for me? Now if I owe God, indeed, a human being and my own blood; but I am now in this juncture, that a demand is made upon me for the payment of that debt, I am undoubtedly guilty of cheating God if I do my best to withhold payment. I have well kept the commandment, if, rendering to Caesar the things which are Caesar's, I refuse to God the things which are God's!","title":"IX.

Therefore this man also, who in buying himself has bought the Spirit of Christ, will hear that word, \"Your money perish with you, since you have thought that the grace of God is to be had at a price!\"[fn-19-P1993_605563:50-nf] Yet who will despise him for being (what he is), a denier? For what says that extorter? Give me money: assuredly that he may not deliver him up, since he tries to sell you nothing else than that which he is going to give you for money. When you put that into his hands, it is certainly your wish not to be delivered up. But not delivered up, had you to be held up to public ridicule? While, then, in being unwilling to be delivered up, you are not willing to be thus exposed; by this unwillingness of yours you have denied that you are what you have been unwilling to have it made public that you are. Nay, you say, While I am unwilling to be held up to the public as being what I am, I have acknowledged that I am what I am unwilling to be so held up as being, that is, a Christian. Can Christ, therefore, claim that you, as a witness for Him, have stedfastly shown Him forth? He who buys himself off does nothing in that way. Before one it might, I doubt not, be said, You have confessed Him; so also, on the account of your unwillingness to confess Him before many you have denied Him. A man's very safety will pronounce that he has fallen while getting out of persecution's way. He has fallen, therefore, whose desire has been to escape. The refusal of martyrdom is denial. A Christian is preserved by his wealth, and for this end has his treasures, that he may not suffer, while he will be rich toward God. But it is the case that Christ was rich in blood for him. Blessed therefore are the poor, because, He says, the kingdom of heaven is theirs who have the soul only treasured up.[fn-19-P1994_607173:51-nf] If we cannot serve God and mammon, can we be redeemed both by God and by mammon? For who will serve mammon more than the man whom mammon has ransomed? Finally, of what example do you avail yourself to warrant your averting by money the giving of you up? When did the apostles, dealing with the matter, in any time of persecution trouble, extricate themselves by money? And money they certainly had from the prices of lands which were laid down at their feet,[fn-19-P1995_607649:52-nf] there being, without a doubt, many of the rich among those who believed-men, and also women, who were wont, too, to minister to their comfort. When did Onesimus, or Aquila, or Stephen,[fn-19-P1996_607856:53-nf] give them aid of this kind when they were persecuted? Paul indeed, when Felix the governor hoped that he should receive money for him from the disciples,[fn-19-P1997_608052:54-nf] about which matter he also dealt with the apostle in private, certainly neither paid it himself, nor did the disciples for him. Those disciples, at any rate. who wept because he was equally persistent in his determination to go to Jerusalem, and neglectful of all means to secure himself from the persecutions which had been foretold as about to occur there, at last say, \"Let the will of the Lord be done.\" What was that will? No doubt that he should suffer for the name of the Lord, not that he should be bought off. For as Christ laid down His life for us, so, too, we should do for Him; and not only for the Lord Himself, nay, but likewise for our brethren on His account. This, too, is the teaching of John when he declares, not that we should pay for our brethren, but rather that we should die for them. It makes no difference whether the thing not to be done by you is to buy off a Christian, or to buy one. And so the will of God accords with this. Look at the condition-certainly of God's ordaining, in whose hand the king's heart is-of kingdoms and empires. For increasing the treasury there are daily provided so many appliances-registerings of property, taxes in kind benevolences, taxes in money; but never up to this time has ought of the kind been provided by bringing Christians under some purchase-money for the person and the sect, although enormous gains could be reaped from numbers too great for any to be ignorant of them. Bought with blood, paid for with blood, we owe no money for our head, because Christ is our Head. It is not fit that Christ should cost us money. How could martyrdoms, too, take place to the glory of the Lord, if by tribute we should pay for the liberty of our sect? And so he who stipulates to have it at a price, opposes the divine appointment. Since, therefore, Caesar has imposed nothing on us after this fashion of a tributary sect-in fact, such an imposition never can be made,-with Antichrist now close at hand, and gaping for the blood, not for the money of Christians-how can it be pointed out to me that there is the command, \"Render to Caesar the things which are Caesar's? \"[fn-19-P1998_610207:55-nf] A soldier, be he an informer or an enemy, extorts money from me by threats, exacting nothing on Caesar's behalf; nay, doing the very opposite, when for a bribe he lets me go-Christian as I am, and by the laws of man a criminal. Of another sort is the denarius which I owe to Caesar, a thing belonging to him, about which the question then was started, it being a tribute coin due indeed by those subject to tribute, not by children. Or how shall I render to God the things which are God's,-certainly, therefore, His own likeness and money inscribed with His name, that is, a Christian man? But what do I owe God, as I do Caesar the denarius, but the blood which His own Son shed for me? Now if I owe God, indeed, a human being and my own blood; but I am now in this juncture, that a demand is made upon me for the payment of that debt, I am undoubtedly guilty of cheating God if I do my best to withhold payment. I have well kept the commandment, if, rendering to Caesar the things which are Caesar's, I refuse to God the things which are God's!","title":"IX.

Sumptuous and splend identertainers give frequent and constant entertainments, alike to display their own wealth, and to show goodwill to their acquaintance. So also the grace of the Spirit, affording us a proof of his own power, and displaying much good-will towards the friends of God, sets before us successively and constantly the tables of the martyrs. Lately, for instance, a maiden quite young, and unmarried, the blessed martyr Pelagia, entertained us, with much joy. To-day again, this blessed and noble martyr Ignatius has succeeded to her feast. The persons are different: The table is one. The wrestlings are varied: The crown is one. The contests are manifold: The prize is the same. For in the case of the heathen contests, since the tasks are bodily, men alone are, with reason, admitted. But here, since the contest is wholly concerning the soul, the lists are open to each sex, for each kind the theatre is arranged. Neither do men alone disrobe, in order that the women may not take refuge in the weakness of their nature, and seem to have a plausible excuse, nor have women only quitted themselves like men, lest the race of men be put to shame; but on this side and on that many are proclaimed conquerors, and are crowned, in order that thou mayest learn by means of the exploits themselves that in Christ Jesus neither male nor female,[fn-7-P775_505088:2-nf] neither sex, nor weakness of body, nor age, nor any such thing could be a hindrance to those who run in the course of religion; if there be a noble readiness, and an eager mind, and a fear of God, fervent and kindling, be established in our souls. On this account both maidens and women, and men, both young and old, and slaves, and freemen, and every rank, and every age, and each sex, disrobe for those contests, and in no respect suffer harm, since they have brought a noble purpose to these wrestlings. The season then already calls us to discourse of the mighty works of this saint. But our reckoning is disturbed and confused, not knowing what to say first, what second, what third, so great a multitude of things calling for eulogy surrounds us, on every side; and we experience the same thing as if any one went into a meadow, and seeing many a rosebush and many a violet, and an abundance of lilies, and other spring flowers manifold and varied, should be in doubt what he should look at first, what second, since each of those he saw invites him to bestow his glances on itself. For we too, coming to this spiritual meadow of the mighty works of Ignatius, and beholding not the flowers of spring, but the manifold and varied fruit of the spirit in the soul of this man, are confused and in perplexity, not knowing to which we are first to give our consideration, as each of the things we see draws us away from its neighbours, and entices the eye of the soul to the sight of its own beauty. For see, he presided over the Church among us nobly, and with such carefulness as Christ desires. For that which Christ declared to be the highest standard and rule of the Episcopal office, did this man display by his deeds.

For as air is not retained in water when it is dragged down by some weighty body and left in the depth of the water, but rises quickly to its kindred element, while the water is often raised up together with the air in its upward rush, being moulded by the circle of air into a convex shape with a slight and membrane-like surface, so too, when the true Life that underlay the flesh sped up, after the Passion, to Itself, the flesh also was raised up with It, being forced upwards from corruption to incorruptibility by the Divine immortality. And as fire that lies in wood hidden below the surface is often unobserved by the senses of those who see, or even touch it, but is manifest when it blazes up, so too, at His death (which He brought about at His will, Who separated His soul from His Body, Who said to His own Father \"Into Thy hands I commend My Spirit[fn-16-P1650_955589:54-nf] ,\" Who, as He says, \"had power to lay it down and had power to take it again[fn-16-P1651_955690:55-nf] \"), He Who, because He is the Lord of glory, despised that which is shame among men, having concealed, as it were, the flame of His life in His bodily Nature, by the dispensation of His death[fn-16-P1652_955902:56-nf] , kindled and inflamed it once more by the power of His own Godhead, fostering into life that which had been brought to death, having infused with the infinity of His Divine power that humble first-fruits of our nature, made it also to be that which He Himself was-making the servile form to be Lord, and the Man born of Mary to be Christ, and Him Who was crucified through weakness to be Life and power, and making all that is piously conceived to be in God the Word to be also in that which the Word assumed, so that these attributes no longer seem to be in either Nature by way of division, but that the perishable Nature being, by its commixture with the Divine, made anew in conformity with the Nature that overwhelms it, participates in the power of the Godhead, as if one were to say that mixture makes a drop of vinegar mingled in the deep to be sea, by reason that the natural quality of Ibis liquid does not continue in the infinity of that which overwhelms it[fn-16-P1653_957000:57-nf] .

Not that this people was to be in that servitude under the oppressive Egyptians for 400 years, but it is foretold that this should take place in the course of those 400 years.

Some there were who said, \"I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me;\"[fn-36-P3643_1397870:42-nf] and, \"There is no rest in my bones, by reason of my sins;\"[fn-36-P3644_1397945:43-nf] and, \"Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit in my inward parts;\"[fn-36-P3645_1398053:44-nf] and, \"Stablish me with Thy directing Spirit;\"[fn-36-P3646_1398116:45-nf] and, \"Take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.\"[fn-36-P3647_1398174:46-nf] There were some, again, who said: \"I believed, therefore have I spoken.\"[fn-36-P3648_1398264:47-nf] For they too were cleansed with the self-same faith with which we ourselves are. Whence the apostle also says: \"We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believe, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak.\"[fn-36-P3649_1398538:48-nf] Out of very faith was it said, \"Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel,\"[fn-36-P3650_1398678:49-nf] \"which is, being interpreted, God with us.\"[fn-36-P3651_1398741:50-nf] Out of very faith too was it said concerning Him: \"As a bridegroom He cometh out of His chamber; as a giant did He exult to run His course. His going forth is from the extremity of heaven, and His circuit runs to the other end of heaven; and no one is hidden from His heat.\"[fn-36-P3652_1399034:51-nf] Out of very faith, again, was it said to Him: \"Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of Thy kingdom.

They, indeed, who were able in faithful love to foretell these things to us were not themselves partakers of them. The Apostle Peter says, \"Why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.\"[fn-36-P3654_1399849:53-nf] Now on what principle does he make this statement, if it be not because even they were saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and not the law of Moses, from which comes not the cure, but only the knowledge of sin?[fn-36-P3655_1400097:54-nf] Now, however, the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets.[fn-36-P3656_1400231:55-nf] If, therefore, it is now manifested, it even then existed, but it was hidden. This concealment was symbolized by the veil of the temple. When Christ was dying, this veil was rent asunder,[fn-36-P3657_1400438:56-nf] to signify the full revelation of Him. Even of old, therefore there existed amongst the people of God this grace of the one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; but like the rain in the fleece which God sets apart for His inheritance,[fn-36-P3658_1400710:57-nf] not of debt, but of His own will, it was latently present, but is now patently visible amongst all nations as its \"floor,\" the fleece being dry,-in other Words, the Jewish people having become reprobate.[fn-36-P3659_1400934:58-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_23_book_ii_","source_chapter":39,"source_paragraph":"130","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"There was a change of the sacramental ordinances made after the coming of Him whose advent they prefigured; but there was no change in the Mediator's help, who, even previous to His coming in the flesh, all along delivered the ancient members of His body by their faith in His incarnation; and in respect of ourselves too, though we were dead in sins and in the uncircumcision of our flesh, we are quickenedtogether in Christ, in whom we are circumcised with the circumcision not made with the hand,[fn-37-P3708_1414064:83-nf] but such as was prefigured by the old manual circumcision, that the body of sin might be done away[fn-37-P3709_1414185:84-nf] which was born with us from Adam.

One would think they might be satisfied with the authority of the apostles, who declare that what we read in the writings of the Hebrew prophets was fulfilled in Christ, or with that of Christ Himself, who says that these things were written of Him. Whoever is unable to point out the passages should lay the blame on his own ignorance; for the apostles and Christ and the sacred Scriptures are not chargeable with falsehood. However, one instance out of many may be adduced. The apostle, in the verses following the passage quoted above, says: \"The word of God cannot fail. For they are not all Israel which are of Israel; neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called: that is, they which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God; but the children of promise are counted for the seed.\"[fn-13-P1399_743934:17-nf] What can our opponent says against this, in view of the declaration made to Abraham: \"In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed?\" At the time when the apostle gave the following exposition of this promise, \"To Abraham and to his seed were the promises made. He saith not, To seed, as of many, but as of one, To thy seed, which is Christ,\"[fn-14-P1400_744308:18-nf] a doubt on this point might then have been less inexcusable, for at that time all nations had not yet believed on Christ, who is preached as of the seed of Abraham. But now that we see the fulfillment of what we read in the ancient prophecy,-now that all nations are actually blessed in the seed of Abraham, to whom it was said thousands of years ago, \"In thy seed shall all nations be blessed,\"-it is mere obstinate folly to try to bring in another Christ, not of the seed of Abraham, or to hold that there are no predictions of Christ in the prophetical books of the children of Abraham.","title":"Book XII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_25_book_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"11. Then God says to Cain: \"Thou art cursed from the earth, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother's blood at thy hand. For thou shalt till the earth, and it shall no longer yield unto thee its strength. A mourner and an abject shalt thou be on the earth.\" It is not, Cursed is the earth, but, Cursed art thou from the earth, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother's blood at thy hand. So the unbelieving people of the Jews is cursed from the earth, that is, from the Church, which in the confession of sins has opened its mouth to receive the blood shed for the remission of sins by the hand of the people that would not be under grace, but under the law. And this murderer is cursed by the Church; that is, the Church admits and avows the curse pronounced by the apostle: \"Whoever are of the works of the law are under the curse of the law.\"[fn-14-P1416_752904:29-nf] Then, after saying, Cursed art thou from the earth, which has opened its mouth to receive thy brother's blood at thy hand, what follows is not, For thou shalt till it, but, Thou shalt till the earth, and it shall not yield to thee its strength. The earth he is to till is not necessarily the same as that which opened its mouth to receive his brother's blood at his hand. From this earth he is cursed, and so he tills an earth which shall no longer yield to him its strength. That is, the Church admits and avows the Jewish people to be cursed, because after killing Christ they continue to till the ground of an earthly circumcision, an earthly Sabbath, an earthly passover, while the hidden strength or virtue of making known Christ, which this tilling contains, is not yielded to the Jews while they continue in impiety and unbelief, for it is revealed in the New Testament. While they will not turn to God, the veil which is on their minds in reading the Old Testament is not taken away. This veil is taken away only by Christ, who does not do away with the reading of the Old Testament, but with the covering which hides its virtue. So, at the crucifixion of Christ, the veil was rent in twain, that by the passion of Christ hidden mysteries might be revealed to believers who turn to Him with a mouth opened in confession to drink His blood. In this way the Jewish people, like Cain, continue tilling the ground, in the carnal observance of the law, which does not yield to them its strength, because they do not perceive in it the grace of Christ. So too, the flesh of Christ was the ground from which by crucifying Him the Jews produced our salvation, for He died for our offences. But this ground did not yield to them its strength, for they were not justified by the virtue of His resurrection, for He arose again for our justification. As the apostle says: \"He was crucified in weakness, but He liveth by the power of God.\"[fn-14-P1417_754858:30-nf] This is the power of that ground which is unknown to the ungodly and unbelieving. When Christ rose, He did not appear to those who had crucified Him. So Cain was not allowed to see the strength of the ground which he tilled to sow his seed in it; as God said, \"Thou shalt till the ground, and it shall no longer yield unto thee its strength.\"","title":"Book XII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_25_book_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"47. But, it is said, if the prophets foretold Christ, they did not live in a way becoming their office. How can you tell whether they did or not? You are bad judges of what it is to live well or ill, whose justice consists in giving relief to an inanimate melon by eating it, instead of giving food to the starving beggar. It is enough for the babes in the Catholic Church, who do not yet know the perfect justice of the human soul, and the difference between the justice aimed at and that actually attained, to think of those men according to the wholesome doctrine of the apostles, that the just lives by faith. \"Abraham believed God, and it was counted to himfor righteousness. For the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thy seed shall all nations be blessed.\"[fn-15-P1506_812552:82-nf] These are the words of the apostle. If you would, at his clear well-known voice, wake up from your unprofitable dreams, you would follow in the footsteps of our father Abraham, and would be blessed, along with all nations, in his seed. For, as the apostle says, \"He received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had, yet being uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all that believe in un-circumcision; that he might be the father of circumcision not only to those who are of the circumcision, but also to those who follow the footsteps of the faith of our father Abraham in uncircumcision.\"[fn-15-P1507_813212:83-nf] Since the righteousness of Abraham's faith is thus set forth as an example to us, that we too, being justified by faith, may have peace with God, we ought to understand his manner of life, without finding fault with it; lest, by a premature separation from mother-Church, we prove abortions, instead of being brought forth in due time, when the conception has arrived at completeness.","title":"Book XII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":20,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_29_the_epistle_of_ignatius_to_the_antiochians","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"25","folder":"ANF-01","text":"The Evangelists, too, when they declared that the one Father was \"the only true God,\"[fn-27-P2713_443723:15-nf] did not omit what concerned our Lord, but wrote: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

For after saying, \"And for their sakes I sanctify myself,\" to let us understand that He thereby meant that He would sanctify them in Himself, He immediately added, \"That they also may be sanctified in the truth.\" And what else is this but in me, in accordance with the fact that the truth is that Word in the beginning which is God?

And yet the Gentiles also had been driven out: for that is why he mentions this: \"Whom God drave out,\" he says, \"before the face of our fathers. Whom He drave out,\" he says: and even then, no Temple! And so many wonders, and no mention of a Temple! So that, although first there is a Tabernacle, yet nowhere a Temple. \"Until the days of David,\" he says: even David, and no Temple! \"And he sought to find favor before God\" (v. 46): and built not:-so far was the Temple from being a great matter! \"But Solomon built Him an house.\" (v. 47.) They thought Solomon was great: but that he was not better than his father, nay not even equal to him, is manifest. \"Howbeit the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet, Heaven is My throne, and earth is My footstool.\" (v. 48, 49.) Nay, not even these are worthy of God, forasmuch as they are made, seeing they are creatures, the works of His hand.

I must, however, remind you that you ought to look into the contexts[fn-49-P4963_1567280:162-nf] of the two passages. For there is immediately added the interpretation of Emmanuel, \"God with us; \"so that you have to consider not merely the name as it is uttered, but also its meaning. The utterance is Hebrew, Emmanuel, of the prophet's own nation; but the meaning of the word, God with us, is by the interpretation made common property.

Else if you are so foolish, that, because with you He gets the designation God-with-us, not Emmanuel, you therefore are unwilling to grant that He is come whose property it is to be called Emmanuel, as if this were not the same name as God-with-us, you will find among the Hebrew Christians, and amongst Marcionites too, that they name Him Emmanuel when they mean Him to be called God-with-us; just indeed as every nation, by whatever word they would express God-with-us, has called Him Emmanuel, completing the sound in its sense. Now since Emmanuel is God-with-us, and God-with-us is Christ, who is in us (for \"as many of you as are baptized into Christ, have put on Christ\"[fn-49-P4965_1568627:164-nf] ), Christ is as properly implied in the meaning of the name, which is God-with-us, as He is in the pronunciation of the name, which is Emmanuel.

First, I shall offer a full explanation[fn-50-P5077_1595510:257-nf] of the types. And no doubt it was proper that this mystery should be prophetically set forth by types, and indeed chiefly by that method: for in proportion to its incredibility would it be a stumbling-block, if it were set forth in bare prophecy; and in proportion too, to its grandeur, was the need of obscuring it in shadow,[fn-50-P5078_1595853:258-nf] that the difficulty of understanding it might lead to prayer for the grace of God. First, then, Isaac, when he was given up by his father as an offering, himself carried the wood for his own death. By this act he even then was setting forth the death of Christ, who was destined by His Father as a sacrifice, and carried the cross whereon He suffered. Joseph likewise was a type of Christ, not indeed on this ground (that I may not delay my course[fn-50-P5079_1596327:259-nf] ), that he suffered persecution for the cause of God from his brethren, as Christ did from His brethren after the flesh, the Jews; but when he is blessed by his father in these words: \"His glory is that of a bullock; his horns are the horns of a unicorn; with them shall he push the nations to the very ends of the earth,\"[fn-50-P5080_1596966:260-nf] -he was not, of course, designated as a mere unicorn with its one horn, or a minotaur with two; but Christ was indicated in him-a bullock in respect of both His characteristics: to some as severe as a Judge, to others gentle as a Saviour, whose horns were the extremities of His cross. For of the antenna, which is a part of a cross, the ends are called horns; while the midway stake of the whole frame is the unicorn. By this virtue, then, of His cross, and in this manner \"horned,\" He is both now pushing all nations through faith, bearing them away from earth to heaven; and will then push them through judgment, casting them down from heaven to earth. He will also, according to another passage in the same scripture, be a bullock, when He is spiritually interpreted to be Jacob against Simeon and Levi, which means against the scribes and the Pharisees; for it was from them that these last derived their origin.[fn-50-P5081_1597909:261-nf] Like Simeon and Levi, they consummated their wickedness by their heresy, with which they persecuted Christ. \"Into their counsel let not my soul enter; to their assembly let not my heart be united: for in their anger they slew men,\" that is, the prophets; \"and in their self-will they hacked the sinews of a bullock,\"[fn-50-P5082_1598241:262-nf] that is, of Christ. For against Him did they wreak their fury after they had slain His prophets, even by affixing Him with nails to the cross. Otherwise, it is an idle thing[fn-50-P5083_1598484:263-nf] when, after slaying men, he inveighs against them for the torture of a bullock! Again, in the case of Moses, wherefore did he at that moment particularly, when Joshua was fighting Amalek, pray in a sitting posture with outstretched hands, when in such a conflict it would surely have been more seemly to have bent the knee, and smitten the breast, and to have fallen on the face to the ground, and in such prostration to have offered prayer? Wherefore, but because in a battle fought in the name of that Lord who was one day to fight against the devil, the shape was necessary of that very cross through which Jesus was to win the victory? Why, once more, did the same Moses, after prohibiting the likeness of everything, set up the golden serpent on the pole; and as it hung there, propose it as an object to be looked at for a cure?[fn-50-P5084_1599333:264-nf] Did he not here also intend to show the power of our Lord's cross, whereby that old serpent the devil was vanquished,-whereby also to every man who was bitten by spiritual serpents, but who yet turned with an eye of faith to it, was proclaimed a cure from the bite of sin, and health for evermore?","title":"Book III.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":3,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_27_book_xiv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"1. Faustus said: If you ask why we do not believe Moses, it is on account of our love and reverence for Christ. The most reckless man cannot regard with pleasure a person who has cursed his father. So we abhor Moses, not so much for his blasphemy of everything human and divine, as for the awful curse he has pronounced upon Christ the Son of God, who for our salvation hung on the tree. Whether Moses did this intentionally or not is your concern. Either way, he cannot be excused, or considered worthy of belief. His words are, \"Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.\"[fn-15-P1578_856455:1-nf] You tell me to believe this-man, though, if he was inspired, he must have cursed Christ knowingly and intentionally; and if he did it in ignorance, he cannot have been divine. Take either alternative. Moses was no prophet, and while cursing in his usual manner, he fell ignorantly into the sin of blasphemy against God. Or he was indeed divine, and foresaw the future; and from ill-will to our salvation, he directs the venom of his malediction against Him who was to accomplish that salvation on a tree. He who thus injures the Son cannot surely have seen or known the Father. He who knew nothing of the final ascension of the Son, cannot surely have foretold His advent. Moreover, the extent of the injury inflicted by this curse is to be considered. For it denounces all the righteous men and martyrs, and sufferers of every kind, who have died in this way, as Peter and Andrew, and the rest. Such a cruel denunciation could never have come from Moses if he had been a prophet, unless he was a bitter enemy of these sufferers. For he pronounces them cursed not only of men but of God. What hope, then, of blessing remains to Christ, or his apostles, or to us if we happen to be crucified for Christ's sake? It indicates great thoughtlessness in Moses, and the want of all divine inspiration, that he overlooked the fact that men are hung on a tree for very different reasons, some for their crimes, and others who suffer in the cause of God and of righteousness. In this thoughtless way lie heaps all together without distinction under the same curse; whereas if he had had any sense, not to say inspiration, if he wished to single out the punishment of the cross from all others as specially detestable, he would have said, Cursed is every guilty and impious person that hangeth on a tree. This would have made a distinction between the guilty and the innocent. And yet even this would have been incorrect, for Christ took the malefactor from the cross along with himself into the Paradise of his Father. What becomes of the curse on every one that hangeth on a tree? Was Barabbas, the notorious robber, who certainly was not hung on a tree, but was set free from prison at the request of the Jews, more blessed than the thief who accompanied Christ from the cross to heaven? Again, there is a curse on the man that worships the sun or the moon. Now if under a heathen monarch I am forced to worship the sun, and if from fear of this curse I refuse, shall I incur this other curse by suffering the punishment of crucifixion? Perhaps Moses was in the habit of cursing everything good. We think no more of his denunciation than of an old wife's scolding. So we find him pronouncing a curse on all youths of both sexes, when he says: \"Cursed is every one that raiseth not up a seed in Israel.\"[fn-15-P1579_859269:2-nf] This is aimed directly at Jesus, who, according to you, was born among the Jews, and raised up no seed to continue his family. It points too at his disciples, some of whom he took from the wives they had married, and some who were unmarried he forbade to take wives. We have good reason, you see, for expressing our abhorrence of the daring style in which Moses hurls his maledictions against Christ, against light, against chastity, against everything divine. You cannot make much of the distinction between hanging on a tree and being crucified, as you often try to do by way of apology; for Paul repudiates such a distinction when he says, \"Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us; as it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.\"[fn-15-P1580_860074:3-nf] ","title":"Book XIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":20,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_30_5_five_books_in_reply_to_marcion_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1158","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Chiding)-Paul-written that such zeal hath he.[fn-47-P4721_756872:217-nf] ","title":"5.

And I know too how the divine Apostle often appealed to the testimony of his conscience, for \"our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience\"[fn-59-P5933_1472480:221-nf] and again \"I say the truth in Christ I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-59-P5934_1472609:222-nf] Know then, O holy and godly sir, that no one has ever at any time heard us preaching two sons; in fact this doctrine seems to the abominable and impious, for there is one Lord Jesus Christ through whom are all things.

Even the daemons are so called by the Lord \"He shall take unto him seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they shall enter in, and the last state of that man shall be worse than the first.\"[fn-64-P6411_1643864:491-nf] But even this application of the name does not offend the pious reader, for the Father and His only begotten Son and His Holy Spirit are one God by nature; and the divine Word made man, our Lord Jesus Christ, is by nature one Son, only begotten of the Father; and the Comforter who completes the number of the Trinity is one Holy Ghost. Thus though many are named fathers, we worship one Father, the Father before the ages, who Himself gave this title to men, as the Apostle says, \"For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom every fatherhood in heaven and earth is named.\"[fn-64-P6412_1644552:492-nf] Let us not then, because others are called christs, rob ourselves of the worship of our Lord Jesus Christ. For just as though many are called gods and fathers, there is one God and Father over all and before the ages;and though many are called sons, there is one real and natural Son; and though many are styled spirits there is one Holy Ghost; just so though many are called christs there is one Lord Jesus Christ by Whom are all things. And very properly does the Church cling to this name; for she has heard Paul, escorter of the Bride, exclaiming \"I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ,\"[fn-64-P6413_1645336:493-nf] and again \"Husbands love your wives as Christ also loved the Church,\"[fn-64-P6414_1645429:494-nf] and again \"For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.

But the restitution of motion to the maimed, the resurrection of the dead, the supply of loaves, and all the other miracles we believe to be works of the divine power. In this sense I say that the same Lord Christ both suffers and destroys suffering; suffers, that is, as touching the visible, and destroys suffering as touching the ineffably indwelling Godhead. This is proved beyond question by the narrative of the holy evangelists, from whom we learn that when lying in a manger and wrapped in swaddling clothes, He was announced by a star, worshipped by magi and hymned by angels. Thus we reverent discern that the swaddling bands and the want of a bed and all the poverty belonged to the manhood; while the journey of the magi and the guiding of the star and the company of the angels proclaim the Godhead of the unseen. In like manner He makes His escape into Egypt and avoids the fury of Herod by flight,[fn-65-P6538_1688697:576-nf] for He was man; but as the Prophet says \"He shakes the idols of Egypt,\"[fn-65-P6539_1688799:577-nf] for He was by nature God. He is circumcised; He keeps the law; and offers offerings of purification, because He sprang from the root of Jesse. And, as man, He was under the law; and afterwards did away with the law and gave the new covenant, because He was a lawgiver and had promised by the prophets that He Himself would give it. He was baptized by John; and this shews His sharing what is ours. He is testified to by the Father from on high and is pointed out by the Spirit; this proclaims Him eternal. He hungered; but He fed many thousands with five loaves; the latter is divine, the former human. He thirsted and He asked for water; but He was the well of life; the former of His human weakness, the latter of His divine power. He fell asleep in the boat, but he put the tempest of the sea to sleep; the former of His human nature, the latter of His efficient and creative power which has gifted all things with their being. He was weary as he walked; but He healed the halt and raised dead men from their tombs; the former of human weakness, the latter of a power passing that of this world. He feared death and He destroyed death; the former shows that He was mortal, the latter that He was immortal or rather giver of life. \"He was crucified,\" as the blessed Paul says \"through weakness.\"[fn-65-P6540_1690119:578-nf] But as the same Paul says \"Yet He liveth by the power of God.\"[fn-65-P6541_1690207:579-nf] Let that word \"weakness\" teach us that He was not nailed to the tree as the Almighty, the Uncircumscribed, the Immutable and Invariable, but that the nature quickened by the power of God, was according to the Apostle's teaching dead and buried, both death and burial being proper to the form of the servant. \"He broke the gates of brass and cut the bars of iron in sunder\"[fn-65-P6542_1690605:580-nf] and destroyed the power of death and in three days raised His own temple. These are proofs of the form of God in accordance with the Lord's words \"Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.\"[fn-65-P6543_1690834:581-nf] Thus in the one Christ through the sufferings we contemplate the manhood and through the miracles we apprehend the Godhead. We do not divide the two natures into two Christs, and we know that of the Father God the Word was begotten and that of the seed of Abraham and David our nature was assumed. Wherefore also the blessed Paul says when discoursing of Abraham \"He saith not and to seeds as of many; but as of one, and to thy seed which is Christ,\"[fn-65-P6544_1691305:582-nf] and writing to Timothy he says \"Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel.\"[fn-65-P6545_1691456:583-nf] And to the Romans he writes \"Concerning His son Jesus Christ ...which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh.\"[fn-65-P6546_1691602:584-nf] And again \"Whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came.\"[fn-65-P6547_1691705:585-nf] And the Evangelist writes \"The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham,\"[fn-65-P6548_1691836:586-nf] and the blessed Peter in the Acts says David \"being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins, He would raise up Christ to sit on his throne, he seeing this before spake of his resurrection,\"[fn-65-P6549_1692098:587-nf] and God says to Abraham \"In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed,\"[fn-65-P6550_1692204:588-nf] and Isaiah \"There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse and a branch shall grow out of His roots; and there shall rest upon Him[fn-65-P6551_1692364:589-nf] the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of piety and the spirit of the fear of the Lord shall fill Him.\"[fn-65-P6552_1692772:590-nf] And a little further on \"And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek; and His rest shall be glorious.\"[fn-65-P6553_1693018:591-nf] ","title":"Letters of the Blessed Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":3,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_28_book_xv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"8. The true bride of Christ, whom thou hast the audacity to taunt with the stone tablets, knows the difference between the letter and the spirit, or in other words, between law and grace; and serving God no longer in the oldness of the letter, but in newness of spirit, she is not under the law, but under grace. She is not blinded by a spirit of controversy, but learns meekly from the apostle what is this law which we are not to be under; for \"it was given, \"he says, \"on account of transgression, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made.\"[fn-16-P1636_906298:18-nf] And again: \"It entered, that the offence might abound; but where sin abounded, grace has much more abounded.\"[fn-16-P1637_906427:19-nf] Not that the law is sin, though it cannot give life without grace, but rather increases the guilt; for \"where there is no law, there is no transgression.\"[fn-16-P1638_906599:20-nf] The letter without the spirit, the law without grace, can only condemn. So the apostle explains his meaning, in case any should not understand: \"What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. For I had not known sin but by the law. For I had not known lust unless the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. But sin, taking occasion by the command-merit, deceived me, and by it slew me. Therefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, wrought death in me by that which is good.\"[fn-16-P1639_907217:21-nf] She at whom thou scoffest knows what this means; for she asks earnestly, and seeks humbly, and knocks meekly. She sees that no fault is found with the law, when it is said, \"The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life,\" any more than with knowledge, when it is said, \"Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.\"[fn-16-P1640_907551:22-nf] The passage runs thus: \"We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.\" The apostle certainly had no desire to be puffed up; but he had knowledge, because knowledge joined with love not only does not puff up, but strengthens. So the letter when joined with the spirit, and the law when joined with grace, is no longer the letter and the law in the same sense as when by itself it kills by abounding sin. In this sense the law is even called the strength of sin, because its strict prohibitions increase the fatal pleasure of sin. Even thus, however, the law is not evil; but \"sin. that it may appear sin, works death by that which is good.\" So things that are not evil may often be hurtful to certain people. The Manichaeans, when they have sore eyes, will shut out their god the sun. The bride of Christ, then, is dead to the law, that is, to sin, which abounds more from the prohibition of the law; for the law apart from grace commands, but does not enable. Being dead to the law in this sense, that she may be married to another who rose from the dead, she makes this distinction without any reproach to the law, which would be blasphemy against its author. This is thy crime; for though the apostle tells thee that the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good, thou dost not acknowledge it as the production of a good being. Its author thou makest to be one of the princes of darkness. Here the truth confronts thee. They are the words of the Apostle Paul: \"The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.\" Such is the law given by Him who appointed for a great symbolical use the tablets which thou foolishly deridest. The same law which was given by Moses becomes through Jesus Christ grace and truth; for the spirit is joined to the letter, that the righteousness of the law might begin to be fulfilled, which when unfulfilled only added the guilt of transgression. The law which is holy, and just, and good, is the same law by which sin works death, and to which we must die, that we may be married to another who rose from the dead. Hear what the apostle adds: \"But sin, that it might appear sin, wrought death in me by that which is good, that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.\" Deaf and blind, dost thou not now hear and see? \"Sin wrought death in me,\" he says, \"by that which is good.\" The law is always good: whether it hurts those who are destitute of grace, or benefits those who are filled with grace, itself is always good; as the sun is always good, for every creature of God is good, whether it hurts weak eyes or gladdens the sight of the healthy. Grace fits the mind for keeping the law, as health fits the eyes for seeing the sun. And as healthy eyes die not to the pleasure of seeing the sun, but to that painful effect of the rays which beat upon the eye so as to increase the darkness; so the mind, healed by the love of the spirit, dies not to the justice of the law, but to the guilt and transgression which followed on the law in the absence of grace. So it is said \"The law is good, if used lawfully;\" and immediately after of the same law, \"Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man.\" The man who delights in righteousness itself, does not require the restraint of the letter.","title":"Book XV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":28,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_115_tractate_cx_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"2. But then after saying, \"That they also may be one in us,\" He added, \"That the world may believe that Thou hast sent me.\" What does He mean by this? Is it that the world will then be brought to the faith, when we shall all be one in the Father and Son? Is not such a state the everlasting peace, and the reward of faith, rather than faith itself? For we shall be one not in order to our believing, but because we have believed. But although in this life, because of the common faith itself, all who believe in one are one according to the words of the apostle, \"For ye are all one in Christ Jesus ;\"[fn-35-P3540_1961183:2-nf] even thus we are one, not in order to our believing, but because we do believe. What, then, is meant by the words, \"That they all may be one, that the world may believe\"? This, doubtless, that the \"all\" are themselves the believing world. For those who shall be one are not of one class, and the world that is thereafter to believe on this very ground that these shall be one, of another; since it is perfectly certain that He says, \"That they all may be one,\" of those of whom He had said before, \"Neither pray I for these alone, but for those also who shall believe on me through their word,\" immediately adding as He does, \"That they all may be one.\" And this \"all,\" what is it but the world; not certainly that which is hostile, but that which is believing? For you see here that He who had said, \"I pray not for the world,\" now prayeth for the world that it may believe. For there is a world whereof it is written, \"That we might not be condemned with this world.\"[fn-35-P3541_1962170:3-nf] For that world He prayeth not, for He is fully aware to what it is predestinated. And there is a world whereof it is written, \"For the Son of man came not to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved ;\"[fn-35-P3542_1962414:4-nf] and hence the apostle also says, \"God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself.\"[fn-35-P3543_1962522:5-nf] For this world it is that He prayeth, in saying, \"That the world may believe that Thou hast sent me.\" For through this faith the world is reconciled unto God when it believes in the Christ whom God has sent. How, then, are we to understand Him when He says, \"That they also may be one in us, that the world may believe that Thou hast sent me,\" but just in this way, that He did not assign the cause of the world believing to the fact that those others are one, as if it believed on the ground that it saw them to be one; for the world itself here consisteth of all who by their own believing become one; but in His prayer He said, \"That the world may believe,\" just as in His prayer He also said, \"That they all may be one;\" and still further in the same prayer, \"That they also may be one in us.\" For the words, \"they all may be one,\" are equivalent to \"the world may believe,\" since it is by believing that they become one, perfectly one; that is, those who, although one by nature, had ceased to be so by their mutual dissensions. In fine, if the verb which He uses, \"I pray,\" be understood in the third clause, or rather, to make the whole fuller, be everywhere supplied, the explanation of this sentence will be all the clearer: I pray \"that they all may be one; as Thou, Father, in me, and I in Thee ;\" I pray \"that they also may be one in us ;\" I pray \"that the world may believe that Thou hast sent me.\" And, mark, He added the words \"in us\" in order that we may know that our being made one in that love of unchanging faithfulness is to be attributed to the grace of God, and not to ourselves: just as the apostle, after saying, \"For ye were at one time darkness, but now are ye light,\" that none might attribute the doing of this to themselves, added, \"in the Lord.\"[fn-35-P3544_1964316:6-nf] ","title":"Tractate CX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_28_book_ii_","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"114","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But let him inform us how it was that his[fn-42-P4215_1591457:54-nf] soul would be cut off from his people if he had not been circumcised on the eighth day. How could he have so sinned, how so offended God, as to be punished for the neglect of others towards him with so severe a sentence, had there been no original sin in the case? For thus ran the commandment of God concerning the circumcision of infants: \"The uncircumcised man-child, whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised on the eighth day, his soul shall be cut off from his people; because he hath broken my covenant.\"[fn-42-P4216_1591994:55-nf] Let him tell us, if he can, how that child broke God's covenant,-an innocent babe, so far as he was personally concerned, of eight days' age; and yet there is by no means any falsehood uttered here by God or Holy Scripture. The fact is, the covenant of God which he then broke was not this which commanded circumcision, but that which forbade the tree; when \"by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for in him all have sinned.\"[fn-42-P4217_1592493:56-nf] And in his case the expiation of this was signified by the circumcision of the eighth day, that is, by the sacrament of the Mediator who was to be incarnate. For it was through this same faith in Christ, who was to come in the flesh, and was to die for us, and on the third day (which coming after the seventh or Sabbath day, was to be the eighth) to rise again, that even holy men were saved of old. For \"He was delivered for our offences, and raised again for our justification.\"[fn-42-P4218_1592992:57-nf] Ever since circumcision was instituted amongst the people of God, which was at that time the sign of the righteousness of faith, it availed also to signify the cleansing even in infants of the original and primitive sin, just as baptism in like manner from the time of its institution began to be of avail for the renewal of man. Not that there was no justification by faith before circumcision; for even when he was still in uncircumcision, Abraham was himself justified by faith, being the father of those nations which should also imitate his faith.[fn-42-P4219_1593563:58-nf] In former times, however, the sacramental mystery of justification by faith lay concealed in every mode. Still it was the self-same faith in the Mediator which saved the saints of old, both small and great-not the old covenant, \"which gendereth to bondage;\"[fn-42-P4220_1593843:59-nf] not the law, which was not so given as to be able to give life;[fn-42-P4221_1593925:60-nf] but the grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord.[fn-42-P4222_1593996:61-nf] For as we believe that Christ has come in the flesh, so they believed that He was to come; as, again, we believe that He has died, so they believed that He would die; and as we believe that He has risen from the dead, so they believed that He would rise again; whilst both we and they believe alike, that He will hereafter come to judge the quick and the dead.

Itself is Grace, that is free gift,[fn-34-P3427_1577342:25-nf] which they understand not to have come to them from God, who still desire to be under the bonds of the Law. Whom Paul deservedly rebukes as unbelievers, because they do not believe that now through our Lord Jesus they have been set free from that bondage, under which they were placed for a certain time by the most just appointment of God. Hence is that saying of the same Apostle, \"For the Law was our schoolmaster in Christ.\"[fn-34-P3428_1577789:26-nf] He therefore gave to men a schoolmaster to fear, Who after gave a Master to love. And yet in these precepts and commands of the Law, which now it is not allowed Christians to use, such as either the Sabbath, or Circumcision, or Sacrifices, and if there be any thing of this kind, so great mysteries are contained, as that every pious person may understand, there is nothing more deadly than that whatever is there be understood to the letter, that is, to the word:[fn-34-P3429_1578286:27-nf] and nothing more healthful than that it be unveiled in the Spirit.

Forasmuch as the same Apostle straightway adds, \"But when thou shalt have passed over to Christ, the veil shall be taken away.\"[fn-34-P3432_1579306:30-nf] For he saith not, the Law shall be taken away, or, the Old Testament.

In this manner all they are dealt with, who earnestly and piously, not disorderly and shamelessly, seek the sense of those Scriptures, and they are carefully shown both the order of events, and the causes of deeds and words, and so great agreement of the Old Testament with the New, that there is left no jot[fn-34-P3433_1579881:31-nf] that agrees not; and so great secrets of figures, that all the things that are drawn forth by interpretation force them to confess that they are wretched, who will to condemn these before they learn them.","title":"On the Profit of Believing.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_29_book_xvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"24. We have already said as much as appeared desirable of the curse pronounced on every one that hangs on a tree. Enough has been said to show that the command to kill any prophet or prince who tried to turn away the children of Israel from their God, or to break any commandment, is not directed against Christ. The more we consider the words and actions of our Lord Jesus Christ, the more clearly will this appear; for Christ never tried to turn away any of the Israelites from their God. The God whom Moses taught the people to love and serve, is the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, whom the Lord Jesus Christ speaks of by this name, using the name in refutation of the Sadducees, who denied the resurrection of the dead. He says, \"Of the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read what God said from the bush to Moses, I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living; for all live unto Him.\"[fn-17-P1723_966801:44-nf] In the same words with which Christ answered the Sadducees we may answer the Manichaeans, for they too deny the resurrection, though in a different way. Again, when Christ said, in praise of the centurion's faith, \"Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel,\" He added, \"And I say unto you, that many shall come from the east and from the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven; but the children of the kingdom shall go into outer darkness.\"[fn-17-P1724_967367:45-nf] If, then, as Faustus must admit, the God of whom Moses spoke was the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, of whom Christ also spoke, as these passages prove, it follows that Christ did not try to turn away the people from their God. On the contrary, He warned them that they would go into outer darkness, because He saw that they were turned away from their God, in whose kingdom He says the Gentiles called from the whole world will sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; implying that they would believe in the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob. So the apostle also says: \"The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, In thy seed shall all nations be blessed.\"[fn-17-P1725_968148:46-nf] It is implied that those who are blessed in the seed of Abraham shall imitate the faith of Abraham. Christ, then, did not try to turn away the Israelites from their God, but rather charged them with being turned away. The idea that Christ broke one of the commandments given by Moses is not a new one, for the Jews thought so; but it is a mistake, for the Jews were in the wrong. Let Faustus mention the commandment which he supposes the Lord to have broken, and we will point out his mistake, as we have done already, when it was required. Meanwhile it is enough to say, that if the Lord had broken any commandment, He could not have found fault with the Jews for doing so. For when the Jews blamed His disciples for eating with unwashen hands, in which they transgressed not a commandment of God, but the traditions of the elders, Christ said, \"Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God, that ye may observe your traditions?\" He then quotes a commandment of God, which we know to have been given by Moses. \"For God said,\" He adds, \"Honor thy father and mother, and he that curseth father or mother shall die the death. But ye say, Whoever shall say to his father or mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me, is not obliged to honor his father. So ye make the word of God of none effect by your traditions.\"[fn-17-P1726_969509:47-nf] From this several things maybe learned: that Christ did not turn away the Jews from their God; that He not only did not Himself break God's commandments, but found fault with those who did so; and that it was God Himself who gave these commandments by Moses.","title":"Book XVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_23_psalm_liii_liv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"17","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"13. For next there follows: I will sacrifice unto Thee freely. The sacrifices of the Law, which consisted of whole burnt-offerings and oblations of goats and of bulls, did not involve an expression of free will, because the sentence of a curse was pronounced on all who broke the Law. Whoever failed to sacrifice laid himself open to the curse. And it was always necessary to go through the whole sacrificial action because the addition of a curse to the commandment forbad any trifling with the obligation of offering. It was from this curse that our Lord Jesus Christ redeemed us, when, as the Apostle says: Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made curse for us, for it is written: cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree[fn-25-P2519_1602698:12-nf] . Thus He offered Himself to the death of the accursed that He might break the curse of the Law, offering Himself voluntarily a victim to God the Father, in order that by means of a voluntary victim the curse which attended the discontinuance of the regular victim might be removed. Now of this sacrifice mention is made in another passage of the Psalms: Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared for Me[fn-25-P2520_1603151:13-nf] ; that is, by offering to God the Father, Who refused the legal sacrifices, the acceptable offering of the body which He received.

These things being thus demonstrated, it is superfluous to touch upon the other points, or to enter upon any discussion relating to them, since the body in which the Word was is not coessential with the Godhead, but was truly born of Mary, while the Word Himself was not, changed into bones and flesh, but came in the flesh. For what John said, `The Word was made flesh[fn-100-P10058_3600290:26-nf] ,' has this meaning, as we may see by a similar passage; for it is written in Paul:`Christ has become a curse for us[fn-100-P10059_3600424:27-nf] .' And just as He has not Himself become a curse, but is said to have done so because He took upon Him the curse on our behalf, so also He has become flesh not by being changed into flesh, but because He assumed on our behalf living flesh, and has become Man. For to say `the Word became flesh,' is equivalent to saying `the Word has become man;' according to what is said in Joel: `I will pour forth of My Spirit upon all flesh[fn-100-P10060_3600871:28-nf] ;' for the promise did not extend to the irrational animals, but is for men, on whose account the Lord is become Man. As then this is the sense of the above text, they all will reasonably condemn themselves who have thought that the flesh derived from Mary existed before her, and that the Word, prior to her, had a human soul, and existed in it always even before His coming. And they too will cease who have said that the Flesh was not accessible to death, but belonged to the immortal Nature. For if it did not die, how could Paul deliver to the Corinthians `that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures[fn-100-P10061_3601510:29-nf] ,' or how did He rise at all if He did not also die? Again, they will blush deeply who have even entertained the possibility of a Tetrad instead of a Triad resulting, if it were said that the Body was derived from Mary. For if (they argue) we say the Body is of one Essence with the Word, the Triad remains a Triad; for then the Word imports no foreign element into it; but if we admit that the Body derived from Mary is human, it follows, since the Body is foreign in Essence, and the Word is in it, that the addition of the Body causes a Tetrad instead of a Triad.","title":"Letter LIX.

He brings forward once more some of the Master's words, to this effect: \"And it is in precisely the same manner that we are taught by Holy Scripture the employment of a conception. Our Lord Jesus Christ, when declaring to men the nature of His Godhead, explains it by certain special characteristics, calling Himself the Door, the Bread, the Way, the Vine, the Shepherd, the Light.\" Now I think it seemly to pass over his insolent remarks on these words (for it is thus that his rhetorical training has taught him to contend with his opponents), nor will I suffer myself to be disturbed by his ebullitions of childish folly. Let us, however, examine one pungent and \"irresistible\" argument which he puts forward for our refutation. Which of the sacred writers, he asks, gives evidence that these names were attributed to our Lord by a conception? But which of them, I reply, forbids it, deeming it a blasphemy to regard such names as the result of a conception? For if he maintains that its not being mentioned is a proof that it is forbidden, by a parity of reasoning he must admit that its not being forbidden is an argument that it is permitted. Is our Lord called by these names, or does Eunomius deny this also? If he does deny that these names are spoken of Christ, we have conquered without a battle. For what more signal victory could there be, than to prove our adversary to be fighting against God, by robbing the sacred words of the Gospel of their meaning? But if he admits that it is true that Christ is named by these names, let him say in what manner they may be applied without irreverence to the Only-begotten Son of God. Does he take \"the stone\" as indicative of His nature? Does he understand His essence under the figure of the Axe (not to encumber our argument by enumerating the rest)? None of these names represents the nature of the Only-begotten, or His Godhead, or the peculiar character of His essence. Nevertheless He is called by these names, and each appellation has its own special fitness. For we cannot, without irreverence, suppose anything in the words of God to be idle and unmeaning. Let him say, then, if he disallows these names as the result of a conception, how do they apply to Christ? For we on our part say this, that as our Lord provided for human life in various forms, each variety of His beneficence is suitably distinguished by His several names, His provident care and working on our behalf passing over into the mould of a name. And such a name is said by us to be arrived at by a conception. But if this is not agreeable to our opponents, let it be as each of them pleases. In his ignorance, however, of the figures of Scripture, our opponent contradicts what is said. For if he had learned the Divine names, he must have known that our Lord is called a Curse and Sin[fn-22-P2289_1487760:72-nf] , and a Heifer[fn-22-P2290_1487794:73-nf] , and a lion's Whelp[fn-22-P2291_1487833:74-nf] , and a Bear bereaved of her whelps[fn-22-P2292_1487888:75-nf] , and a Leopard[fn-22-P2293_1487924:76-nf] and such-like names, according to various modes of conception, by Holy Scripture, the sacred and inspired writers by such names, as by well-directed shafts, indicating the central point of the idea they had in view; even though these words, when taken in their literal and obvious signification, seem not above suspicion, but each single one of them, unless we allow it to be predicated of God by some process of conception, will not escape the taint of a blasphemous suggestion. But it would be a lengthy task to bring them forward, and elucidate in every case how, in the general idea, these words have been perverted[fn-22-P2294_1488565:77-nf] out of their obvious meanings, and how it is only in connection with the conceptive faculty that the names of God can be reconciled with that reverence which is His due.","title":"Answer to Eunomius' Second Book","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":3,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_24_book_ii_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"135","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"93.

I regret still to have to contend about the law-after I have so often proved that its replacement (by the gospel)[fn-77-P7778_2219605:595-nf] affords no argument for another god, predicted as it was indeed in Christ, and in the Creator's own plans[fn-77-P7779_2219732:596-nf] ordained for His Christ. (But I must revert to that discussion) so far as (the apostle leads me, for) this very epistle looks very much as if it abrogated[fn-77-P7780_2219910:597-nf] the law. We have, however, often shown before now that God is declared by the apostle to be a Judge; and that in the Judge is implied an Avenger; area in the Avenger, the Creator. And so in the passage where he says: \"I am not ashamed of the gospel (of Christ): for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that beheveth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek; for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith,\"[fn-77-P7781_2220372:598-nf] he undoubtedly ascribes both the gospel and salvation to Him whom (in accordance with our heretic's own distinction) I have called the just God, not the good one. It is He who removes (men) from confidence in the law to faith in the gospel-that is to say,[fn-77-P7782_2220651:599-nf] His own law and His own gospel. When, again, he declares that \"the wrath (of God) is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness,\"[fn-77-P7783_2220864:600-nf] (I ask) the wrath of what God? Of the Creator certainly. The truth, therefore, will be His, whose is also the wrath, which has to be revealed to avenge the truth. Likewise, when adding, \"We are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth,\"[fn-77-P7784_2221131:601-nf] he both vindicated that wrath from which comes this judgment for the truth, and at the same time afforded another proof that the truth emanates from the same God whose wrath he attested, by witnessing to His judgment. Marcion's averment is quite a different matter, that[fn-77-P7785_2221421:602-nf] the Creator in anger avenges Himself on the truth of the rival god which had been detained in unrighteousness. But what serious gaps Marcion has made in this epistle especially, by withdrawing whole passages at his will, will be clear from the unmutilated text of our own copy.[fn-77-P7786_2221720:603-nf] It is enough for my purpose to accept in evidence of its truth what he has seen fit to leave unerased, strange instances as they are also of his negligence and blindness. If, then, God will judge the secrets of men-both of those who have sinned in the law, and of those who have sinned without law (inasmuch as they who know not the law yet do by nature the things contained in the law)[fn-77-P7787_2222134:604-nf] -surely the God who shall judge is He to whom belong both the law, and that nature which is the rule[fn-77-P7788_2222258:605-nf] to them who know not the law. But how will He conduct this judgment? \"According to my gospel,\" says (the apostle), \"by (Jesus) Christ.\"[fn-77-P7789_2222457:606-nf] So that both the gospel and Christ must be His, to whom appertain the law and the nature which are to be vindicated by the gospel and Christ-even at that judgment of God which, as he previously said, was to be according to truth.[fn-77-P7790_2222707:607-nf] The wrath, therefore, which is to vindicate truth, can only be revealed from heaven by the God of wrath;[fn-77-P7791_2222831:608-nf] so that this sentence, which is quite in accordance with that previous one wherein the judgment is declared to be the Creator's,[fn-77-P7792_2222979:609-nf] cannot possibly be ascribed to another god who is not a judge, and is incapable of wrath. It is only consistent in Him amongst whose attributes are found the judgment and the wrath of which I am speaking, and to whom of necessity must also appertain the media whereby these attributes are to be carried into effect. even the gospel and Christ. Hence his invective against the transgressors of the law, who teach that men should not steal, and yet practise theft themselves.[fn-77-P7793_2223503:610-nf] (This invective he utters) in perfect homage[fn-77-P7794_2223568:611-nf] to the law of God, not as if he meant to ten sure the Creator Himself with having commanded[fn-77-P7795_2223676:612-nf] a fraud to be practised against the Egyptians to get their gold and silver at the very time when He was forbidding men to steal,[fn-77-P7796_2223825:613-nf] -adopting such methods as they are apt (shamelessly) to charge upon Him in other particulars also. Are we then to suppose[fn-77-P7797_2224006:614-nf] that the apostle abstained through fear from openly calumniating God, from whom notwithstanding He did not hesitate to withdraw men? Well, but he had gone so far in his censure of the Jews, as to point against them the denunciation of the prophet, \"Through you the name of God is blasphemed (among the Gentiles).\"[fn-77-P7798_2224347:615-nf] But how absurd, that he should himself blaspheme Him for blaspheming whom he upbraids them as evil-doers! He prefers even circumcision of heart to neglect of it in the flesh. Now it is quite within the purpose of the God of the law that circumcision should be that of the heart, not in the flesh; in the spirit, and not in the letter.[fn-77-P7799_2224703:616-nf] Since this is the circumcision recommended by Jeremiah: \"Circumcise (yourselves to the Lord, and take away) the foreskins of your heart; \"[fn-78-P7800_2224862:617-nf] and even of Moses: \"Circumcise, therefore, the hardness of your heart,\"[fn-78-P7801_2224953:618-nf] -the Spirit which circumcises the heart will proceed from Him who prescribed the letter also which clips[fn-78-P7802_2225086:619-nf] the flesh; and \"the Jew which is one inwardly\" will be a subject of the self-same God as he also is who is \"a Jew outwardly; \"[fn-78-P7803_2225228:620-nf] because the apostle would have preferred not to have mentioned a Jew at all, unless he were a servant of the God of the Jews. It was once[fn-78-P7804_2225386:621-nf] the law; now it is \"the righteousness of God which is by the faith of (Jesus) Christ.\"[fn-78-P7805_2225486:622-nf] What means this distinction? Has your god been subserving the interests of the Creator's dispensation, by affording time to Him and to His law? Is the \"Now\" in the hands of Him to whom belonged the \"Then\"? Surely, then, the law was His, whose is now the righteousness of God. It is a distinction of dispensations, not of gods. He enjoins those who are justified by faith in Christ and not by the law to have peace with God.[fn-78-P7806_2225935:623-nf] With what God? Him whose enemies we have never, in any dispensation,[fn-78-P7807_2227095:624-nf] been? Or Him against whom we have rebelled, both in relation to His written law and His law of nature? Now, as peace is only possible towards Him with whom there once was war, we shall be both justified by Him, and to Him also will belong the Christ, in whom we are justified by faith, and through whom alone God's[fn-78-P7808_2227426:625-nf] enemies can ever be reduced to peace. \"Moreover,\" says he, \"the law entered, that the offence might abound.\"[fn-78-P7809_2227548:626-nf] And wherefore this? \"In order,\" he says, \"that (where sin abounded), grace might much more abound.\"[fn-78-P7810_2227667:627-nf] Whose grace, if not of that God from whom also came the law? Unless it be, forsooth, that[fn-78-P7811_2227776:628-nf] the Creator intercalated His law for the mere purpose of[fn-78-P7812_2227871:629-nf] producing some employment for the grace of a rival god, an enemy to Himself (I had almost said, a god unknown to Him), \"that as sin had\" in His own dispensation[fn-78-P7813_2228048:630-nf] \"reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto (eternal) life by Jesus Christ,\"[fn-78-P7814_2228174:631-nf] His own antagonist! For this (I suppose it was, that) the law of the Creator had \"concluded all under sin,\"[fn-78-P7815_2228301:632-nf] and had brought in \"all the world as guilty (before God),\" and had \"stopped every mouth,\"[fn-78-P7816_2228412:633-nf] so that none could glory through it, in order that grace might be maintained to the glory of the Christ, not of the Creator, but of Marcion! I may here anticipate a remark about the substance of Christ, in the prospect of a question which will now turn up. For he says that \"we are dead to the law.\"[fn-78-P7817_2228733:634-nf] It may be contended that Christ's body is indeed a body, but not exactly[fn-78-P7818_2229130:635-nf] flesh. Now, whatever may be the substance, since he mentions \"the body of Christ,\"[fn-78-P7819_2229298:636-nf] whom he immediately after states to have been \"raised from the dead,\"[fn-78-P7820_2229381:637-nf] none other body can be understood than that of the flesh,[fn-78-P7821_2229459:638-nf] in respect of which the law was called (the law) of death.[fn-78-P7822_2229894:639-nf] But, behold, he bears testimony to the law, and excuses it on the ground of sin: \"What shall we say, therefore? Is the law sin? God forbid.\"[fn-78-P7823_2230110:640-nf] Fie on you, Marcion. \"God forbid!\" (See how) the apostle recoils from all impeachment of the law. I, however, have no acquaintance with sin except through the law.[fn-78-P7824_2230294:641-nf] But how high an encomium of the law (do we obtain) from this fact, that by it there comes to light the latent presence of sin![fn-78-P7825_2230560:642-nf] It was not the law, therefore, which led me astray, but \"sin, taking occasion by the commandment.\"[fn-78-P7826_2230776:643-nf] Why then do you, (O Marcion, ) impute to the God of the law what His apostle dares not impute even to the law itself? Nay, he adds a climax: \"The law is holy, and its commandment just and good.\"[fn-78-P7827_2230991:644-nf] Now if he thus reverences the Creator's law, I am at a loss to know how he can destroy the Creator Himself. Who can draw a distinction, and say that there are two gods, one just and the other good, when He ought to be believed to be both one and the other, whose commandment is both \"just and good? \"Then, again, when affirming the law to be \"spiritual\"[fn-78-P7828_2231366:645-nf] he thereby implies that it is prophetic, and that it is figurative. Now from even this circumstance I am bound to conclude that Christ was predicted by the law but figuratively, so that indeed He could not be recognised by all the Jews.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":3,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_32_book_xix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"7.

So the same apostle says: \"For before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which was afterwards revealed.

And although they paid attention to the signs of spiritual realities in place of the realities themselves, not knowing to what the signs referred, still they had this conviction rooted in their minds, that in subjecting themselves to such a bondage they were doing the pleasure of the one invisible God of all.

But those who did believe, from among whom the first Church at Jerusalem was formed, showed clearly how great an advantage it had been to be so guided by the schoolmaster that signs, which had been for a season imposed on the obedient, fixed the thoughts of those who observed them on the worship of the One God who made heaven and earth. These men, because they had been very near to spiritual things (for even in the temporal and carnal offerings and types, though they did not clearly apprehend their spiritual meaning, they had learnt to adore the One Eternal God,) were filled with such a measure of the Holy Spirit that they sold all their goods, and laid their price at the apostles' feet to be distributed among the needy,[fn-50-P5090_2731031:24-nf] and consecrated themselves wholly to God as a new temple, of which the old temple they were serving was but the earthly type.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":29,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_34_book_iii","source_chapter":33,"source_paragraph":"120","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"44.

As regards the prophet Hosea, it is unnecessary for me to explain the meaning of the command, or of the prophet's conduct, when God said to him, \"Go and take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and produce children of whoredoms,\" for the Scripture itself informs us of the origin and purpose of this direction. It proceeds thus: \"For the land hath committed great whoredom, departing from the Lord. So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son. And the Lord said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Judah, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel. And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel. And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said unto him, Call her name No-mercy: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away. But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the Lord their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen. Now when she had weaned No-mercy, she conceived, and bare a son. Then said God, Call his name Not-my-people: for ye are not my people, and I will not be your God. Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured for multitude; and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God. Then shall the children of Israel and the children of Judah be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel. Say ye unto your brethren, My people; and to your sister, She hath found mercy.\"[fn-22-P2281_1375111:174-nf] Since the typical meaning of the command and of the prophet's conduct is thus explained in the same book by the Lord Himself, and since the writings of the apostles declare the fulfillment of this prophecy in the preaching of the New Testament, every one must accept the explanation thus given of the command and of the action of the prophet as the true explanation. Thus it is said by the Apostle Paul, \"That He might make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, which He had afore prepared unto glory, even us, whom He hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles. As He saith also in Hosea, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved. And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there shall they be called the children of the living God.\"[fn-22-P2282_1376010:175-nf] Here Paul applies the prophecy to the Gentiles. So also Peter, writing to the Gentiles, without naming the prophet, borrows his expressions when he says, \"But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye might show forth the praises of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvellous light; which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.\"[fn-22-P2283_1376509:176-nf] From this it is plain that the words of the prophet, \"And the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured for multitude,\" and the words immediately following, \"And it shall be that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there they shall be called the children of the living God,\" do not apply to that Israel which is after the flesh, but to that of which the apostle says to the Gentiles, \"Ye therefore are the seed of Abraham, and heirs according to the promise.\"[fn-22-P2284_1377071:177-nf] But, as many Jews who were of the Israel after the flesh have believed, and will yet believe; for of these were the apostles, and all the thousands in Jerusalem of the company of the apostles, as also the churches of which Paul speaks, when he says to the Galatians, \"I was unknown by face to the churches of Judaea which were in Christ;\"[fn-22-P2285_1377431:178-nf] and again, he explains the passage in the Psalms, where the Lord is called the cornerstone,[fn-22-P2286_1377542:179-nf] as referring to His uniting in Himself the two walls of circumcision and uncircumcision, \"that He might make in Himself of twain one new man, so making peace; and that He might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby: and that He might come and preach peace to them that are far off, and to them that are nigh,\" that is, to the Gentiles and to the Jews; \"for He is our peace, who hath made of both one;\"[fn-22-P2287_1378011:180-nf] to the same purpose we find the prophet speaking of the Jews as the children of Judah, and of the Gentiles as children of Israel, where he says, \"The children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together, and shall make to themselves one head, and shall go up from the land.\" Therefore, to speak against a prophecy thus confirmed by actual events, is to speak against the writings of the apostles as well as those of the prophets; and not only to speak against writings, but to impugn in the most reckless manner the evidence clear as noonday of established facts. In the case of the narrative of Judah, it is perhaps not so easy to recognize, under the disguise of the woman called Tamar, the harlot representing the Church gathered from among the corruption of Gentile superstition; but here, where Scripture explains itself, and where the explanation is confirmed by the writings of the apostles, instead of dwelling longer on this, we may proceed at once to inquire into the meaning of the very things to which Faustus objects in Moses the servant of God.","title":"Book XXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_39_on_the_flesh_of_christ_","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"73","folder":"ANF-03","text":"They may, then, obliterate the testimony of the devils which proclaimed Jesus the son of David; but whatever unworthiness there be in this testimony, that of the apostles they will never be able to efface, There is, first of all, Matthew, that most faithful chronicler[fn-96-P9611_2637295:305-nf] of the Gospel, because the companion of the Lord; for no other reason in the world than to show us clearly the fleshly original[fn-96-P9612_2637443:306-nf] of Christ, he thus begins his Gospel: \"The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.\"[fn-96-P9613_2637622:307-nf] With a nature issuing from such fountal sources, and an order gradually descending to the birth of Christ, what else have we here described than the very flesh of Abraham and of David conveying itself down, step after step, to the very virgin, and at last introducing Christ,-nay, producing Christ Himself of the virgin? Then, again, there is Paul, who was at once both a disciple, and a master, and a witness of the selfsame Gospel; as an apostle of the same Christ, also, he affirms that Christ \"was made of the seed of David, according to the flesh,\"[fn-96-P9614_2638195:308-nf] -which, therefore, was His own likewise. Christ's flesh, then, is of David's seed. Since He is of the seed of David in consequence of Mary's flesh, He is therefore of Mary's flesh because of the seed of David. In what way so ever you torture the statement, He is either of the flesh of Mary because of the seed of David, or He is of the seed of David because of the flesh of Mary. The whole discussion is terminated by the same apostle, when he declares Christ to be \"the seed of Abraham.\" And if of Abraham, how much more, to be sure, of David, as a more recent progenitor! For, unfolding the promised blessing upon all nations in the person[fn-96-P9615_2638870:309-nf] of Abraham, \"And in thy seed shall all nations of the earth be blessed,\" he adds, \"He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.\"[fn-96-P9616_2639084:310-nf] When we read and believe these things, what sort of flesh ought we, and can we, acknowledge in Christ? Surely none other than Abraham's, since Christ is \"the seed of Abraham; \"none other than Jesse's, since Christ is the blossom of \"the stem of Jesse; \"none other than David's, since Christ is \"the fruit of David's loins; \"none other than Mary's, since Christ came from Mary's womb; and, higher still, none other than Adam's, since Christ is \"the second Adam.\" The consequence, therefore, is that they must either maintain, that those (ancestors) had a spiritual flesh, that so there might be derived to Christ the same condition of substance, or else allow that the flesh of Christ was not a spiritual one, since it is not traced from the origin[fn-96-P9617_2639856:311-nf] of a spiritual stock.

Just so, there are these two marriages for our choice, the one effected in the flesh, the other in the spirit; and preoccupation? the one must cause of necessity alienation from the other. No more is the eye able to look at two objects at once; but it must concentrate its special attention on one at a time; no more can the tongue effect utterances in two different languages, so as to pronounce, for instance, a Hebrew word and a Greek word in the same moment: no more can the ear take in at one and the same time a narrative of facts, and a hortatory discourse; if each special tone is heard separately, it will impress its ideas upon the hearers' minds; but if they are combined and so poured into the ear, an inextricable confusion of ideas will be the result, one meaning being mutually lost in the other: and no more, by analogy, do our emotional powers possess a nature which can at once pursue the pleasures of sense and court the spiritual union; nor, besides, can both those ends be gained by the same courses of life; continence, mortification of the passions, scorn of fleshly needs, are the agents of the oneunion; but all that are the reverse of these are the agents of bodily habitation. As, when two masters are before us to choose between, and we cannot be subject to both, for \"no man can serve two masters[fn-28-P2849_1923509:142-nf] ,\" he who is wise will choose the one most useful to himself, so, when two marriages are before us to choose between, and we cannot contract both, for \"he that is unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, but he that is married careth for the things of the world[fn-28-P2850_1923799:143-nf] ,\" I repeat that it would be the aim of a sound mind not to miss choosing the more profitable one; and not to be ignorant either of the way which will lead it to this, a way which cannot be learnt but by some such comparison as the following. In the case of a marriage of this world a man who is anxious to avoid appearing altogether insignificant pays the greatest attention both to physical health, and becoming adornment, and amplitude of means and the security from any disgraceful revelations as to his antecedents or his parentage; for so he thinks things will be most likely to turn out as he wishes.

As for family distinction, he will not vaunt that which comes by the mere routine of devolution even to numbers of the worthless, but that which is gained by the successful efforts of his own zeal and labours; a distinction which only those can boast of who are \"sons of the light\" and children of God, and are styled \"nobles from the sunrise[fn-28-P2852_1925172:145-nf] \" because of their splendid deeds. Strength and health he will not try to gain by bodily training and feeding, but by all that is the contrary of this, perfecting the spirit's strength in the body's weakness. I could tell also of the suitor's gifts to the bride in such a wedding[fn-28-P2853_1925611:146-nf] ; they are not procured by the money that perishes, but are contributed out of the wealth peculiar to the soul.

He mentions much else that is priceless in it, and adds, \"in chastity[fn-28-P2855_1926213:148-nf] \"; and besides this all the recognized fruits of the spirit from any quarter whatever are gifts of this marriage. If a man is going to carry out the advice of Solomon and take for helpmate and life-companion that true Wisdom of which he says, \"Love her, and she shall keep thee,\" \"honour her, that she may embrace thee[fn-28-P2856_1926553:149-nf] ,\" then he will prepare himself in a manner worthy of such a love, so as to feast with all the joyous wedding guests in spotless raiment, and not be cast forth, while claiming to sit at that feast, for not having put on the wedding garment. It is plain moreover that the argument applies equally to men and women, to move them towards such a marriage. \"There is neither male nor female[fn-28-P2857_1926959:150-nf] ,\" the Apostle says; \"Christ is all, and in all[fn-28-P2858_1927028:151-nf] \"; and so it is equally reasonable that he who is enamoured of wisdom should hold the Object of his passionate desire, Who is the True Wisdom; and that the soul which cleaves to the undying Bridegroom should have the fruition of her love for the true Wisdom, which is God. We have now sufficiently revealed the nature of the spiritual union, and the Object of the pure and heavenly Love.","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":3,"verse":29,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_122_tractate_cxvii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"5. \"Then said the chief priests of the Jews unto Pilate Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.\" Oh the ineffable power of the working of God, even in the hearts of the ignorant! Was there not some hidden voice that sounded through Pilate's inner man with a kind, if one may so say, of loud-toned silence, the words that had been prophesied so long before in the very letter of the Psalms, \"Corrupt not the inscription of the title\"?[fn-37-P3733_2060170:11-nf] Here, then, you see, he corrupted it not; what he has written he has written. But the high priests, who wished it to be corrupted, what did they say? \"Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.\" What is it, madmen, that you say? Why do you oppose the doing of that which you are utterly unable to alter? Will it by any such means become the less true that Jesus said, \"I am King of the Jews\"? If that cannot be tampered with which Pilate has written, can that be tampered with which the truth has uttered? But is Christ king only of the Jews, or of the Gentiles also? Yes, of the Gentiles also. For when He said in prophecy, \"I am set king by Him upon His holy hill of Zion, declaring the decree of the Lord,\" that no one might say, because of the hill of Zion, that He was set king over the Jews alone, He immediately added, \"The Lord said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten Thee. Ask of me, and I will give Thee the Gentiles for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy poossession.\"[fn-37-P3734_2061249:12-nf] Whence He Himself, speaking now with His own lips among the Jews, said, \"Other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice, and there shall be one flock and one Shepherd.\"[fn-37-P3735_2061489:13-nf] Why then would we have some great mystery[fn-37-P3736_2061549:14-nf] to be understood in this superscription, wherein it was written, \"King of the Jews,\" if Christ is king also of the Gentiles? For this reason, because it was the wild olive tree that was made partaker of the fatness of the olive tree, and not the olive tree that was made partaker of the bitterness of the wild olive tree.[fn-37-P3737_2061889:15-nf] For inasmuch as the title, \"King of the Jews,\" was truthfully written regarding Christ, who are they that are to be understood as the Jews but the seed of Abraham, the children of the promise, who are also the children of God? For \"they,\" saith the apostle, \"who are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God; but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.\"[fn-37-P3738_2062295:16-nf] And the Gentiles were those to whom he said, \"But if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.\"[fn-37-P3739_2062449:17-nf] Christ therefore is king of the Jews, but of those who are Jews by the circumcision of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God;[fn-37-P3740_2062645:18-nf] who belong to the Jerusalem thatis free, our eternal mother in heaven, the spiritual Sarah, who casteth out the bond maid and her children from the house of liberty.[fn-37-P3741_2062829:19-nf] And therefore what Pilate wrote he wrote, because what the Lord said He said.","title":"Tractate CXVII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":27,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_37_book_xxiv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"1. Faustus said: We are asked the reason But we do not assert that man is in no sense for our denial that man is made by God. made by God; we only ask in what sense, and when, and how. For, according to the apostle, there are two men, one of whom he calls sometimes the outer man, generally the earthy, sometimes, too, the old man: the other he calls the inner or heavenly or new man.[fn-23-P2341_1416225:1-nf] The question is, Which of these is made by God? For there are likewise two times of our nativity; one when nature brought us forth into this light, binding us in the bonds of flesh; and the other, when the truth regenerated us on our conversion from error and our entrance into the faith. It is this second birth of which Jesus speaks in the Gospel, when He says, \"Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\"[fn-23-P2342_1416726:2-nf] Nicodemus, not knowing what Christ meant, was at a loss, and inquired how this could be, for an old man could not enter into his mother's womb and be born a second time. Jesus said in reply, \"Except a man be born of water and of the Holy Spirit, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\" Then He adds, \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.\" Hence, as the birth in which our bodies originate is not the only birth, but there is another in which we are born again in spirit, an important question arises from this distinction as to which of those births it is in which God makes us. The manner of birth also is twofold. In the humiliating process of ordinary generation, we spring from the heat of animal passion; but when we are brought into the faith, we are formed under good instruction in honor and purity in Jesus Christ, by the Holy Spirit. For this reason, in all religion, and especially in the Christian religion, young children are invited to membership. This is hinted at in the words of His apostle: \"My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you.\"[fn-23-P2343_1417885:3-nf] The question, then, is not whether God makes man, but what man He makes, and when, and how. For if it is when we are fashioned in the womb that God forms us after His own image, which is the common belief of Gentiles and Jews, and which is also your belief, then God makes the old man, and produces us by means of sensual passion, which does not seem suitable to His divine nature. But if it is when we are converted and brought to a better life that we are formed by God, which is the general doctrine of Christ and His apostles, and which is also our doctrine, in this case God makes us new men, and produces us in honor and purity, which would agree perfectly with His sacred and adorable majesty. If you do not reject Paul's authority, we will prove to you from him what man God makes, and when, and how. He says to the Ephesians, \"That ye put off according to your former conversation the old man, which is corrupt through deceitful lusts; and be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and holiness of truth.\"[fn-23-P2344_1418981:4-nf] This shows that in the creation of man after the image of God, it is another man that is spoken of, and another birth, and another manner of birth. The putting off and putting on of which he speaks, point to the time of the reception of the truth; and the assertion that the new man is created by God implies that the old man is created neither by God nor after God. And when he adds, that this new man is made in holiness and righteousness and truth, he thus points to another manner of birth of which this is the character, and which, as I have said, differs widely from the manner in which bodily generation is effected. And as he declares that only the former is of God, it follows that the latter is not. Again, writing to the Colossians, he uses words to the same effect: \"Put off the old man with his deeds, and put on the new man, which is renewed in the knowledge of God according to the image of Him who created Him in you.\" Here he not only shows that it is the new man that God makes, but he declares the time and manner of the formation, for the words in the knowledge of God point to the time of believing. Then he adds, according to the image of Him who created him, to make it clear that the old man is not the image of God, nor formed by God. Moreover, the following words, \"Where there is neither male nor female, Jew nor Greek, Barbarian nor Scythian,\"[fn-23-P2345_1420372:5-nf] show more plainly still that the birth by which we are made male and female, Greeks and Jews, Scythians and Barbarians, is not the birth in which God effects the formation of man; but that the birth with which God has to do is that in which we lose the difference of nation and sex and condition, and become one like Him who is one, that is, Christ. So the same apostle says again, \"As many as have been baptized in Christ have put on Christ: there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither male nor female, there is neither bond nor free; but all are one in Christ.\"[fn-23-P2346_1420960:6-nf] Man, then, is made by God, not when from one he is divided into many, but when from many he becomes one. The division is in the first birth, or that of the body; union comes by the second, which is immaterial and divine. This affords sufficient ground for our opinion, that the birth of the body should be ascribed to nature, and the second birth to the Supernal Majesty. So the same apostle says again to the Corinthians, \"I have begotten you in Christ Jesus by the gospel;\"[fn-23-P2347_1421459:7-nf] and, speaking of himself, to the Galatians, \"When it pleased Him, who separated me from my mother's womb, to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood.\"[fn-23-P2348_1421703:8-nf] It is plain that everywhere he speaks of the second or spiritual birth as that in which we are made by God, as distinct from the indecency of the first birth, in which we are on a level with other animals as regards dignity and purity, as we are conceived in the maternal womb, and are formed, and brought forth. You may observe that in this matter the dispute between us is not so much about a question of doctrine as of interpretation. For you think that it is the old or outer or earthy man that is said to have been made by God; while we apply this to the heavenly man, giving the superiority to the inner or new man. And our opinion is not rash or groundless, for we have learned it from Christ and His apostles, who are proved to have been the first in the world who thus taught.","title":"Book XXIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_38_book_iii_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"This is what we say; this is that about which they object to us that we say \"that the law was so given as to be a cause of greater sin.\" They do not hear the apostle saying, \"For the law worketh wrath; for where no law is, there is no transgression;\"[fn-53-P5397_2116975:9-nf] and, \"The law was added for the sake of transgression until the seed should come to whom the promise was made;\"[fn-53-P5398_2117104:10-nf] and, \"If there had been a law given which could have given life, righteousness should altogether have been by the law; but the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.\"[fn-53-P5399_2117370:11-nf] Hence it is that the Old Testament, from the Mount Sinai, where the law was given, gendereth to bondage, which is Agar. \"Now we,\" says he, \"are not children of the bondmaid but of the freewoman.\"[fn-54-P5400_2117589:12-nf] Therefore they are not children of the freewoman who have accepted the law of the letter, whereby they can be shown to be not only sinners, but moreover transgressors; but they who have received the Spirit of grace, whereby the law itself, holy and just and good, may be fulfilled.

And what he says in the former testimony, \"What then is the law?\" and answered, \"It was added for the sake of transgression,\" this he instantly added in the latter testimony, \"For the law worketh wrath: for where there is no law, there is no transgression.\"","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_38_book_iii_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But some one will say, \"In what way is that called the old which was given by Moses four hundred and thirty years after; and that called the new which was given so many years before to Abraham?\" Let him who on this subject is disturbed, not litigiously but earnestly, first understand that when from its earlier time one is called \"old,\" and from its posterior time the other \"new,\" it is the revelation of them that is considered in their names, not their institution. Because the old testament was revealed through Moses, by whom the holy and just and good law was given, whereby should be brought about not the doing away but the knowledge of sin,-by which the proud might be convicted who were desirous of establishing their own righteousness, as if they had no need of divine help, and being made guilty of the letter, might flee to the Spirit of grace, not to be justified by their own righteousness, but by that of God-that is, by the righteousness which was given to them of God. For as the same apostle says, \"By the law is the knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and by the prophets.\"[fn-54-P5471_2143467:53-nf] Because the law, by the very fact that in it no man is justified, affords a witness to the righteousness of God. For that in the law no man is justified before God is manifest, because \"the just by faith lives.\"[fn-54-P5472_2143702:54-nf] Thus, therefore, although the law does not justify the wicked when he is convicted of transgression, it sends to the God who justifieth, and thus affords a testimony to the righteousness of God. Moreover, the prophets offer testimony to God's righteousness by fore-announcing Christ, \"who is made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: that, as it is written, he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.\"[fn-54-P5473_2144168:55-nf] But that law was kept hidden from the beginning, when nature itself convicted wicked men, who did to others what they would not have done to themselves. But the revelation of the new testament in Christ was made when He was manifested in the flesh, wherein appeared the righteousness of God -that is, the righteousness which is to men from God. For hence he says, \"But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested.\"[fn-54-P5474_2144621:56-nf] This is the reason why the former is called the old testament, because it was revealed in the earlier time; and the latter the new, because it was revealed in the later time. In a word, it is because the old testament pertains to the old man, from which it is necessary that a man should make a beginning; but the new to the new man, by which a than ought to pass from his old state. Thus, in the former are earthly promises, in the latter heavenly promises; because this pertained to God's mercy, that no one should think that even earthly felicity of any kind whatever could be conferred on anybody, save from the Lord, who is the Creator of all things. But if God is worshipped for the sake of that earthly happiness, the worship is that of a slave, belonging to the children of the bondmaid; but if for the sake of God Himself, so that in the life eternal God may be all things in all, it is a free service belonging to the children of the freewoman, who is our mother eternal in the heavens-who first seemed, as it were, barren, when she had not any children manifest; but now we see what was prophesied concerning her: \"Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for there are many children of the desolate more than of her who has an husband,\"[fn-54-P5475_2145935:57-nf] -that is, more than of that Jerusalem, who in a certain manner is married in the bond of the law, and is in bondage with her children. In the time, then, of the old testament, we say that the Holy Spirit, in those who even then were the children of promise according to Isaac, was not only an assistant, which these men think is sufficient for their opinion, but also a bestower of virtue; and this they deny, attributing it rather to their free will, in contradiction to those fathers who knew how to cry unto God with truthful piety, \"I will love Thee, O Lord, my strength.\"[fn-54-P5476_2146530:58-nf] ","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_38_book_iii_","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"76","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"When, then, the Pelagians are pressed with these and such like testimonies and words of truth, not to deny original sin; not to say that the grace of God whereby we are justified is not given freely, but according to our merits; nor to say that in mortal man, however holy and well doing, there is so great righteousness that even after the washing of regeneration, until he finishes this life of his, forgiveness of sins is not necessary to him,-therefore when they are pressed not to make these three assertions, and by their means alienate men who believe them from the grace of the Saviour, and persuade the lifted-up unto pride to go headlong unto the judgment of the devil: they introduce the clouds of other questions in which their impiety-in the sight of men more simpleminded, whether that they are more slow or less instructed in the sacred writings-may be concealed. These are the misty questions of the praise of the creature, of the praise of marriage, of the praise of the law, of the praise of free will, of the praise of the saints; as if any one of our people were in the habit of disparaging those things, and not rather of announcing all things with due praises to the honour of the Creator and Saviour. But even the creature does not desire in such wise to be praised as to be unwilling to be healed. And the more marriage is to be praised, the less is to be attributed to it the shameful concupiscence of the flesh, which is not of the Father, but of the world; and which assuredly marriage found and did not make in men; because, moreover, it is actually in very many without marriage, and if nobody had sinned marriage itself might be without it. And the law, holy and just and good, is neither grace itself, nor is anything rightly done by it without grace; because the law is not given that it may give life, but it was added because of transgression, that it might conclude all persons convicted under sin, and that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.[fn-55-P5547_2179308:96-nf] And the free will taken captive does not avail, except for sin; but for righteousness, unless divinely set free and aided, it does not avail. And thus, also, all the saints, whether from that ancient Abel to John the Baptist, or from the apostles themselves up to this time, and henceforth even to the end of the world, are to be praised in the Lord, not in themselves.

And we might seasonably apply the saying to those who, along with the Christian way of life, prefer to live as the Jews, materially, for these do not see nor beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees, but, contrary to the will of Jesus who forbade it, eat the bread of the Pharisees. Yea and also all, who do not wish to understand that the law is spiritual, and has a shadow of the good things to come,[fn-78-P7860_1665903:38-nf] and is a shadow of the things to come,[fn-78-P7861_1665958:39-nf] neither inquire of what good thing about to be each of the laws is a shadow, nor do they see nor beware of the leaven of the Pharisees; and they also who reject the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead are not on their guard against the leaven of the Sadducees. And there are many among the heterodox who, because of their unbelief in regard to the resurrection of the dead, are imbued with the leaven of the Sadducees.

My Hebrew master also used to say that those two seraphim in Isaiah, which are described as having each six wings, and calling to one another, and saying, \"Holy, holy, holy, is the Loan God of hosts,\"[fn-63-P6346_1161197:68-nf] were to be understood of the only-begotten Son of God and of the Holy Spirit.

For all knowledge of the Father is obtained by revelation of the Son through the Holy Spirit, so that both of these beings which, according to the prophet, are called either \"living things\" or \"lives,\" exist as the ground of the knowledge of God the Father. For as it is said of the Son, that \"no one knoweth the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal Him,\"[fn-63-P6348_1161907:70-nf] the same also is said by the apostle of the Holy Spirit, when He declares, \"God hath revealed them to us by His Holy Spirit; for the Spirit searcheth all things, even the deep things of God; \"[fn-63-P6349_1162117:71-nf] and again in the Gospel, when the Saviour, speaking of the divine and profounder parts of His teaching, which His disciples were not yet able to receive, thus addresses them: \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now; but when the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, is come, He will teach you all things, and will bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\"[fn-63-P6350_1162543:72-nf] We must understand, therefore, that as the Son, who alone knows the Father, reveals Him to whom He will, so the Holy Spirit, who alone searches the deep things of God, reveals God to whom He will: \"For the Spirit bloweth where He listeth.\"[fn-63-P6351_1162823:73-nf] We are not, however, to suppose that the Spirit derives His knowledge through revelation from the Son. For if the Holy Spirit knows the Father through the Son's revelation, He passes from a state of ignorance into one of knowledge; but it is alike impious and foolish to confess the Holy Spirit, and yet to ascribe to Him ignorance. For even although something else existed before the Holy Spirit, it was not by progressive advancement that He came to be the Holy Spirit; as if any one should venture to say, that at the time when He was not yet the Holy Spirit He was ignorant of the Father, but that after He had received knowledge He was made the Holy Spirit. For if this were the case, the Holy Spirit would never be reckoned in the Unity of the Trinity, i.e., along with the unchangeable Father and His Son, unless He had always been the Holy Spirit.

For when he had said, \"For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, that ye may not be wise in yourselves, that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in, and so all Israel should be saved; as it is written, There shall come out of Sion one who shall deliver, and turn away impiety from Jacob: and this is the covenant to them from me, when I shall take away their sins;\"[fn-68-P6857_2620641:104-nf] he immediately added, what is to be very carefully understood, \"As concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sakes: but as concerning the election, they are beloved for their fathers' sake.\"[fn-68-P6858_2620869:105-nf] What is the meaning of, \"as concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sake,\" but that their enmity wherewith they put Christ to death was, without doubt, as we see, an advantage to the gospel? And he shows that this came about by God's ordering, who knew how to make a good use even of evil things; not that the vessels of wrath might be of advantage to Him, but that by His own good use of them they might be of advantage to the vessels of mercy. For what could be said more plainly than what is actually said, \"As concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sakes\"? It is, therefore, in the power of the wicked to sin; but that in sinning they should do this or that by that wickedness is not in their power, but in God's, who divides the darkness and regulates it; so that hence even what they do contrary to God's will is not fulfilled except it be God's will. We read in the Acts of the Apostles that when the apostles had been sent away by the Jews, and had come to their own friends, and shown them what great things the priests and elders said to them, they all with one consent lifted up their voices to the Lord and said, \"Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein; who, by the mouth of our father David, thy holy servant, hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the peoples imagine vain things? The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes were gathered together against the Lord, and against His Christ. For in truth, there have assembled together in this city against Thy holy child Jesus, whom Thou hast anointed, Herod and Pilate, and the people of Israel, to do whatever Thy hand and counsel predestinated to be done.\"[fn-68-P6859_2622614:106-nf] See what is said: \"As concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sakes.\" Because God's hand and counsel predestinated such things to be done by the hostile Jews as were necessary for the gospel, for our sakes. But what is it that follows? \"But as concerning the election, they are beloved for their fathers' sakes.\" For are those enemies who perished in their enmity and those of the same people who still perish in their opposition to Christ,-are those chosen and beloved? Away with the thought! Who is so utterly foolish as to say this? But both expressions, although contrary to one another-that is, \"enemies\" and \"beloved\"-are appropriate, though not to the same men, yet to the same Jewish people, and to the same carnal seed of lsrael, of whom some belonged to the falling away, and some to the blessing of Israel himself. For the apostle previously explained this meaning more dearly when he said, \"That which lsrael wrought for, he hath not obtained; but the election hath obtained in and the rest were blinded?[fn-68-P6860_2623671:107-nf] Yet in both cases it was the very same Israel. Where, therefore, we hear, \"lsrael hath not obtained,\" or, \"The rest were blinded,\" there are to be understood the enemies for our sakes; but where we hear, \"that the election hath obtained it,\" there are to be understood the beloved for their father's sakes, to which fathers those things were assuredly promised; because \"the promises were made to Abraham and his seed,\"[fn-68-P6861_2624110:108-nf] whence also in that olive-tree is grafted the wild olive-tree of the Gentiles. Now subsequently we certainly ought to fall in with the election, of which he says that it is according to grace, not according to debt, because \"there was made a remnant by the election of grace\"[fn-68-P6862_2624407:109-nf] This election obtained it, the rest bring blinded. As concerning this election, the Israelites were beloved for the sake of their fathers. For they were not called with that calling of which it is said, \"Many are called,\" but with that whereby the chosen are called. Whence also after he had said, \"But as concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes,\" he went on to add those words whence this discussion arose: \"For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance,\"-that is, they are firmly established without change. Those who belong to this calling are alI teachable by God; nor can any of them say, \"I believed in order to bring thus called,\" because the mercy of God anticipated him, because he was so called in order that he might believe.

If we are asked why we do not worship God as the Hebrew fathers of the Old Testament worshipped Him, we reply that God has taught us differently by the New Testament fathers, and yet in no opposition to the Old Testament, but as that Testament itself predicted. For it is thus foretold by the prophet: \"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah; not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt.\"[fn-24-P2486_1505446:12-nf] Thus it was foretold that that covenant would not continue, but that there would be a new one. And to the objection that we do not belong to the house of Israel or to the house of Judah, we answer according to the teaching of the apostle, who calls Christ the seed of Abraham, and says to us, as belonging to Christ's body, \"Therefore ye are Abraham's seed.\"[fn-24-P2487_1505829:13-nf] Again, if we are asked why we regard that Testament as authoritative when we do not observe its ordinances, we find the answer to this also in the apostolic writings; for the apostle says, \"Let no man judge you in meat or drink, or in respect of a holiday, or a new moon, or of Sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come.\"[fn-24-P2488_1506175:14-nf] Here we learn both that we ought to read of these observances, and ackowledge them to be of divine institution, in order to preserve the memory of the prophecy, for they were shadows of things to come; and also that we need pay no regard to those who would judge us for not continuing the outward observance; as the apostle says elsewhere to the same purpose, \"These things happened to them for an example; and they are written for our admonition, on whom the end of the ages are come.\"[fn-24-P2489_1506684:15-nf] So, when we read anything in the books of the Old Testament which we are not required to observe in the New Testament, or which is even forbidden, instead of finding fault with it, we should ask what it means; for the very discontinuance of the observance proves it to be, not condemned, but fulfilled.

The first man, when in Paradise, sported free, because he was the child of God; but when he succumbed to pleasure (for the serpent allegorically signifies pleasure crawling on its belly, earthly wickedness nourished for fuel to the flames), was as a child seduced by lusts, and grew old in disobedience; and by disobeying his Father, dishonoured God. Such was the influence of pleasure. Man, that had been free by reason of simplicity, was found fettered to sins. The Lord then wished to release him from his bonds, and clothing Himself with flesh-O divine mystery!-vanquished the serpent, and enslaved the tyrant death; and, most marvellous of all, man that had been deceived by pleasure, and bound fast by corruption, had his hands unloosed, and was set free. O mystic wonder! The Lord was laid low, and man rose up; and he that fell from Paradise receives as the reward of obedience something greater [than Paradise]-namely, heaven itself. Wherefore, since the Word Himself has come to us from heaven, we need not, I reckon, go any more in search of human learning to Athens and the rest of Greece, and to Ionia.

This is the eternal adjustment of the vision, which is able to see the eternal light, since like loves like; and that which is holy, loves that from which holiness proceeds, which has appropriately been termed light. \"Once ye were darkness, now are ye light in the Lord.\"[fn-33-P3386_1015287:56-nf] Hence I am of opinion man was called by the ancientsfw/j.[fn-33-P3387_1015361:57-nf] But he has not yet received, say they, the perfect gift. I also assent to this; but he is in the light, and the darkness comprehendeth him not. There is nothing intermediate between light and darkness. But the end is reserved till the resurrection of those who believe; and it is not the reception of some other thing, but the obtaining of the promise previously made. For we do not say that both take place together at the same time-both the arrival at the end, and the anticipation of that arrival. For eternity and time are not the same, neither is the attempt and the final result; but both have reference to the same thing, and one and the same person is concerned in both. Faith, so to speak, is the attempt generated in time; the final result is the attainment of the promise, secured for eternity. Now the Lord Himself has most clearly revealed the equality of salvation, when He said: \"For this is the will of my Father, that every one that seeth the Son, and believeth on Him, should have everlasting life; and I will raise him up in the last day.\"[fn-33-P3388_1016450:58-nf] As far as possible in this world, which is what he means by the last day, and which is preserved till the time that it shall end, we believe that we are made perfect. Wherefore He says, \"He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life.\"[fn-33-P3389_1016708:59-nf] If, then, those who have believed have life, what remains beyond the possession of eternal life? Nothing is wanting to faith, as it is perfect and complete in itself. If aught is wanting to it, it is not wholly perfect. But faith is not lame in any respect; nor after our departure from this world does it make us who have believed, and received without distinction the earnest of future good, wait; but having in anticipation grasped by faith that which is future, after the resurrection we receive it as present, in order that that may be fulfilled which was spoken, \"Be it according to thy faith.\"[fn-33-P3390_1017328:60-nf] And where faith is, there is the promise; and the consummation of the promise is rest. So that in illumination what we receive is knowledge, and the end of knowledge is rest-the last thing conceived as the object of aspiration. As, then, inexperience comes to an end by experience, and perplexity by finding a clear outlet, so by illumination must darkness disappear. The darkness is ignorance, through which we fall into sins, purblind as to the truth. Knowledge, then, is the illumination we receive, which makes ignorance disappear, and endows us with clear vision. Further, the abandonment of what is bad is the adopting[fn-33-P3391_1017972:61-nf] of what is better. For what ignorance has bound ill, is by knowledge loosed well; those bonds are with all speed slackened by human faith and divine grace, our transgressions being taken away by one Poeonian[fn-33-P3392_1018257:62-nf] medicine, the baptism of the Word. We are washed from all our sins, and are no longer entangled in evil. This is the one grace of illumination, that our characters are not the same as before our washing. And since knowledge springs up with illumination, shedding its beams around the mind, the moment we hear, we who were untaught become disciples. Does this, I ask, take place on the advent of this instruction? You cannot tell the time. For instruction leads to faith, and faith with baptism is trained by the Holy Spirit. For that faith is the one universal salvation of humanity, and that there is the same equality before the righteous and loving God, and the same fellowship between Him and all, the apostle most clearly showed, speaking to the following effect: \"Before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed, so that the law became our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith; but after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.\"[fn-33-P3393_1019327:63-nf] Do you not hear that we are no longer under that law which was accompanied with fear, but under the Word, the master of free choice? Then he subjoined the utterance, clear of all partiality: \"For ye are all the children of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\"[fn-33-P3394_1020084:64-nf] There are not, then, in the same Word some \"illuminated (gnostics); and some animal (or natural) men; \"but all who have abandoned the desires of the flesh are equal and spiritual before the Lord. And again he writes in another place: \"For by one spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free, and we have all drunk of one cup.\"[fn-33-P3395_1020475:65-nf] Nor were it absurd to employ the expressions of those who call the reminiscence of better things the filtration of the spirit, understanding by filtration the separation of what is baser, that results from the reminiscence of what is better. There follows of necessity, in him who has come to the recollection of what is better, repentance for what is worse. Accordingly, they confess that the spirit in repentance retraces its steps. In the same way, therefore, we also, repenting of our sins, renouncing our iniquities, purified by baptism, speed back to the eternal light, children to the Father. Jesus therefore, rejoicing in the spirit, said: \"I thank Thee, O Father, God of heaven and earth, that Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes; \"[fn-33-P3396_1021288:66-nf] the Master and Teacher applying the name babes to us, who are readier to embrace salvation than the wise in the world, who, thinking themselves wise, are inflated with pride. And He exclaims in exultation and exceeding joy, as if lisping with the children, \"Even so, Father; for so it seemed good in Thy sight.\"[fn-33-P3397_1021617:67-nf] Wherefore those things which have been concealed from the wise and prudent of this present world have been revealed to babes. Truly, then, are we the children of God, who have put aside the old man, and stripped off the garment of wickedness, and put on the immortality of Christ; that we may become a new, holy people by regeneration, and may keep the man undefiled. And a babe, as God's little one,[fn-33-P3398_1022035:68-nf] is cleansed from fornication and wickedness. With the greatest clearness the blessed Paul has solved for us this question in his First Epistle to the Corinthians, writing thus: \"Brethren, be not children in understanding; howbeit in malice be children, but in understanding be men.\"[fn-33-P3399_1022507:69-nf] And the expression, \"When I was a child, I thought as a child, I spoke as a child,\"[fn-34-P3400_1022612:70-nf] points out his mode of life according to the law, according to which, thinking childish things, he persecuted, and speaking childish things he blasphemed the Word, not as having yet attained to the simplicity of childhood, but as being in its folly; for the wordnh/pion has two meanings.[fn-34-P3401_1022993:71-nf] \"When I became a man,\" again Paul says, \"I put away childish things.\"[fn-34-P3402_1023129:72-nf] It is not incomplete size of stature, nor a definite measure of time, nor additional secret teachings in things that are manly and more perfect, that the apostle, who himself professes to be a preacher of childishness, alludes to when he sends it, as it were, into banishment; but he applies the name \"children\" to those who are under the law, who are terrified by fear as children are by bugbears; and \"men\" to us who are obedient to the Word and masters of ourselves, who have believed, and are saved by voluntary choice, and are rationally, not irrationally, frightened by terror. Of this the apostle himself shall testify, calling as he does the Jews heirs according to the first covenant, and us heirs according to promise: Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; but is under tutors and governors, till the time appointed by the father. So also we, when we were children, were in bondage under the rudiments of the world: but when the fulness of the time was came, God sent forth His Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons \"[fn-34-P3403_1024335:73-nf] by Him. See how He has admitted those to be children who are under fear and sins; but has conferred manhood on those who are under faith, by calling them sons, in contradistinction from the children that are under the law: \"For thou art no more a servant,\" he says, \"but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.\"[fn-34-P3404_1024673:74-nf] What, then, is lacking to the son after inheritance? Wherefore the expression, \"When I was a child,\" may be elegantly expounded thus: that is, when I was a Jew (for he was a Hebrew by extraction) I thought as a child, when I followed the law; but after becoming a man, I no longer entertain the sentiments of a child, that is, of the law, but of a man, that is, of Christ, whom alone the Scripture calls man, as we have said before. \"I put away childish things.\" But the childhood which is in Christ is maturity, as compared with the law. Having reached this point, we must defend our childhood. And we have still to explain what is said by the apostle: \"I have fed you with milk (as children in Christ), not with meat; for ye were not able, neither yet are ye now able.\"[fn-34-P3405_1025462:75-nf] For it does not appear to me that the expression is to be taken in a Jewish sense; for I shall oppose to it also that Scripture, \"I will bring you into that good land which flows with milk and honey.\"[fn-34-P3406_1025683:76-nf] A very great difficulty arises in reference to the comparison of these Scriptures, when we consider. For if the infancy which is characterized by the milk is the beginning of faith in Christ, then it is disparaged as childish and imperfect. How is the rest that comes after the meat, the rest of the man who is perfect and endowed with knowledge, again distinguished by infant milk? Does not this, as explaining a parable, mean something like this, and is not the expression to be read somewhat to the following effect: \"I have fed you with milk in Christ; \"and after a slight stop, let us add, \"as children,\" that by separating the words in reading we may make out some such sense as this: I have instructed you in Christ with simple, true, and natural nourishment,-namely, that which is spiritual: for such is the nourishing substance of milk swelling out from breasts of love. So that the whole matter may be conceived thus: As nurses nourish new-born children on milk, so do I also by the Word, the milk of Christ, instilling into you spiritual nutriment.","title":"Book I","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":3,"verse":24,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_52_book_i","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"138","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Accordingly, of old He instructed by Moses, and then by the prophets.

Take, in the next place, the subjection by which you subject the Son to the Father. What, you say, is He not now subject, or must He, if He is God, be subject to God?[fn-45-P4505_1418366:20-nf] You are fashioning your argument as if it concerned some robber, or some hostile deity. But look at it in this manner: that as for my sake He was called a curse,[fn-45-P4506_1418782:21-nf] Who destroyed my curse; and sin,[fn-45-P4507_1418834:22-nf] who taketh away the sin of the world; and became a new Adam[fn-45-P4508_1418913:23-nf] to take the place of the old, just so He makes my disobedience His own as Head of the whole body. As long then as I am disobedient and rebellious, both by denial of God and by my passions, so long Christ also is called disobedient on my account. But when all things shall be subdued unto Him on the one hand by acknowledgment of Him, and on the other by a reformation, then He Himself also will have fulfilled His submission, bringing me whom He has saved to God. For this, according to my view, is the subjection of Christ; namely, the fulfilling of the Father's Will. But as the Son subjects all to the Father, so does the Father to the Son; the One by His Work, the Other by His good pleasure, as we have already said. And thus He Who subjects presents to God that which he has subjected, making our condition His own. Of the same kind, it appears to me, is the expression, \"My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?\"[fn-45-P4509_1419855:24-nf] It was not He who was forsaken either by the Father, or by His own Godhead, as some have thought, as if It were afraid of the Passion, and therefore withdrew Itself from Him in His Sufferings (for who compelled Him either to be born on earth at all, or to be lifted up on the Cross?) But as I said, He was in His own Person representing us. For we were the forsaken and despised before, but now by the Sufferings of Him Who could not suffer, we were taken up and saved.

To these we reply, following the Scriptures, by asking them to answers themselveswhat they ask of us. For I beg them to tell us whether there is any remission of sins where there is not charity; for sins are the darkness of the soul.

If, therefore, we say that sins are not remitted there, how is he regenerate who is baptized among them? And what is regeneration in baptism, except the being renovated from the corruption of the old man? And how can he be so renovated whose past sins are not remitted? But if he be not regenerate, neither does he put on Christ; from which it seems to follow that he ought to be baptized again. For the apostle says, \"For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ;\"[fn-31-P3105_1816493:39-nf] and if he has not so put on Christ, neither should he be considered to have been baptized in Christ.

For divine things must be divinely received, and must assuredly be maintained as holy. But a grave fault is branded on those who attach earthly and human doctrine to sacred and spiritual words; and this we must beware of doing. Moreover, we may beware, if any things enjoined by God be so treated as if they were assumed to diminish His authority, test, in calling some things impure and unclean, their institution should dishonour their ordainer. For in reprobating what He has made, He will appear to have condemned His own works, which He had approved as good; and He will be designated as seeming capricious in both cases, as the heretics indeed would have it; either in having blessed things which were not clean, or in subsequently reprobating as not good, creatures which He had blessed as both clean and good. And of this the enormity and contradiction will remain for ever if that Jewish doctrine is persisted in, which must be got rid of with all our ability; so that whatever is irregularly delivered by them, may be taken away by us, and a suitable arrangement of His works, and an appropriate and spiritual application of the divine law, may be restored. But to begin from the beginning of things, whence it behoves me to begin; the only food for the first men was fruit and the produce of the trees. For afterwards, man's sin transferred his need from the fruit-trees to the produce of the earth, when the very attitude of his body attested the condition of his conscience. For although innocency raised men up towards the heavens to pluck their food from the trees so long as they had a good conscience, yet sin, when committed, bent men down to the earth and to the ground to gather its grain. Moreover, afterwards the use of flesh was added, the divine favour supplying for human necessities the kinds of meats generally fitting for suitable occasions. For while a more tender meat was needed to nourish men who were both tender and unskilled, it was still a food not prepared without toil, doubtless for their advantage, lest they should again find a pleasure in sinning, if the labour imposed upon sin did not exhort innocence. And since now it was no more a paradise to be tended, but a whole world to be cultivated, the more robust food of flesh is offered to men, that for the advantage of culture something more might be added to the vigour of the human body. All these things, as I have said, were by grace and by divine arrangement: so that either the most vigorous food should not be given in too small quantity for men's support, and they should be enfeebled for labour; or that the more tender meat should not be too abundant, so that, oppressed beyond the measure of their strength, they should not be able to bear it.[fn-105-P10500_3312354:11-nf] But the law which followed subsequently ordained[fn-105-P10501_3312530:12-nf] the flesh foods with distinction: for some animals it gave and granted for use,[fn-105-P10502_3312816:13-nf] as being clean; some it interdicted as not clean, and conveying pollution to those that eat them. Moreover, it gave this character to those that were clean, that those which chew the cud and divide the hoofs are clean; those are unclean which do neither one nor other of these things. So, in fishes also, the law said that those indeed were clean which were covered with scales and supplied with fins, but that those which were otherwise were not clean. Moreover, it established a distinction among the fowls, and laid down what was to be judged either an abomination, or clean. Thus the law ordained the exercise of very great subtlety in making a separation among those animals which the ancient appointment had gathered together into one form of blessing. What, then, are we to say? Are the animals therefore unclean? But what else is it to say that they are not clean, than that the law has separated them from the uses of food? And what, moreover, is that that we have just now said? Then God is the ordainer of things which are not clean; and the blame attached to things which are made will recoil upon their Maker, who did not produce them clean; to say which is certainly characteristic of extreme and excessive folly: it is to accuse God as having created unclean things, and to charge upon the divine majesty the guilt of having made things which are abomination, especially when they were both pronounced \"very good,\"[fn-105-P10503_3314317:14-nf] and as being good have obtained the blessing from God Himself \"that they should increase and multiply.\" Moreover also they were reserved by the command of the Creator in Noah's ark for the sake of their offspring, that so being kept they might be proved to be needful; and being needful, they might be proved to be good, although even in that case also there is a distinction appended. But still, even then, the creation of those very creatures that were not clean might have been utterly abolished, if it had needed to be abolished on account of its own pollution.","title":"On the Jewish Meats.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":3,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_56_of_patience_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"32","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Accordingly it is patience which is both subsequent and antecedent to faith.

I will add (somewhat) touching the pleasure of patience. For every injury, whether inflicted by tongue or hand, when it has lighted upon patience, will be dismissed[fn-123-P12310_3442335:94-nf] with the same fate as, some weapon launched against and blunted on a rock of most stedfast hardness. For it will wholly fall then and there with bootless and fruitless labour; and sometimes will recoil and spend its rage on him who sent it out, with retorted impetus. No doubt the reason why any one hurts you is that you may be pained; because the hurter's enjoyment consists in the pain of the hurt. When, then, you have upset his enjoyment by not being pained, he must needs he pained by the loss of his enjoyment. Then you not only go unhurt away, which even alone is enough for you; but gratified, into the bargain, by your adversary's disappointment, and revenged by his pain. This is the utility and the pleasure of patience.","title":"Of Patience.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":3,"verse":24,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_57_book_i","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"84","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Accordingly, before the advent of the Lord, philosophy was necessary to the Greeks for righteousness.[fn-49-P4946_1481465:55-nf] And now it becomes conducive to piety; being a kind of preparatory training to those who attain to faith through demonstration. \"For thy foot,\" it is said, \"will not stumble, if thou refer what is good, whether belonging to the Greeks or to us, to Providence.\"[fn-49-P4947_1481783:56-nf] For God is the cause of all good things; but of some primarily, as of the Old and the New Testament; and of others by consequence, as philosophy.

But the law given to us enjoins us to shun what are in reality bad things-adultery, uncleanness, paederasty, ignorance, wickedness, soul-disease, death (not that which severs the soul from the body, but that which severs the soul from truth). For these are vices in reality, and the workings that proceed from them are dreadful and terrible. \"For not unjustly,\" say the divine oracles, \"are the nets spread for birds; for they who are accomplices in blood treasure up evils to themselves.\"[fn-57-P5742_1742017:75-nf] How, then, is the law still said to be not good by certain heresies that clamorously appeal to the apostle, who says, \"For by the law is the knowledge of sin? \"[fn-57-P5743_1742300:76-nf] To whom we say, The law did not cause, but showed sin.

And again, in the Second to the Thessalonians, speaking of Antichrist, he says, \"And then shall that wicked be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus Christ[fn-73-P7391_1974723:54-nf] shall slay with the Spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy him[fn-73-P7392_1974878:55-nf] with the presence of his coming; [even him] whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders.\"[fn-73-P7393_1975105:56-nf] Now in these [sentences] the order of the words is this: \"And then shall be revealed that wicked, whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders, whom the Lord Jesus shall slay with the Spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the presence of His coming.\" For he does not mean that the coming of the Lord is after the working of Satan; but the coming of the wicked one, whom we also call Antichrist.

In conclusion, the Testament is said to have been given to the flames by certain men in the time of persecution. Now let its lessons be read, from whatever source it has been brought to light. Certainly in the beginning of the promises of the Testator this is found to have been said to Abraham: \"In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;\"[fn-46-P4690_2330091:40-nf] and this saying is truthfully interpreted by the apostle: \"To thy seed,\" he says, \"which is Christ.\"[fn-46-P4691_2330212:41-nf] No betrayal on the part of any man has made the promises of God of none effect.

But if you will not do so, which party is the rather to be believed to have insisted on the burning of the Testament, save that which will not assent to its teaching when it is brought to light? For how much more certainly, without any sacrilegious rashness, can he be held to have joined the company of traditors who now persecutes with his tongue the Testament which they are said to have persecuted with the flames! You charge us with the persecution: the true wheat of the Lord answers you, \"Either it was done justly, or it was done by the chaff that was among us.\" What have you to say to this? You object that we have no baptism: the same true wheat of the Lord answers you, that the form of the sacrament even within the Church fails to profit some, as it did no good to Simon Magus when he was baptized, much more it fails to profit those who are without. Yet that baptism remains in them when they depart, is proved from this, that it is not restored to them when they return. Never, therefore, except by the greatest shamelessness, will you be able to cry out against that wheat, or to call them false prophets clad in sheep's clothing, whilst inwardly they are ravening wolves; since either they do not know the wicked in the unity of the Catholic Church, or for the sake of unity bear with those whom they know.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":29,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_61_book_ii_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"135","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"20. Among the many other expressions in your invective, you said: \"If you were to burn with fire the testament of a dead man, would you not be punished as the falsifier of a will? What therefore is likely to become of you who have burned the most holy law of our God and Judge?\" In these words you have paid no attention to what certainlyought to have moved you, to the question of how it might be that we should burn the testament, and yet stand fast in the inheritance which was described in that testament; but it is marvellous that you have preserved the testament and lost the inheritance. Is it not written in that testament, \"Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession\"?[fn-47-P4780_2359067:23-nf] Take part in this inheritance, and you may bring what charges you will against me about the testament. For what madness is it, that while you shrank from committing the testament to the flames, you should yet strive against the words of the testator! We, on the other hand, though we hold in our hands the records of the Church and of the State, in which we read that those who ordained a rival bishop[fn-47-P4781_2359485:24-nf] in opposition to Caecilianus were rather the betrayers of the sacred books, yet do not on this account insult you, or pursue you with invectives, or mourn over the ashes of the sacred pages in your hands, or contrast the burning torments of the Maccabees with the sacrilege of your fear, saying, \"You should deliver your own limbs to the flames rather than the utterances of God.\" For we are unwilling to be so absurd as to excite an empty uproar against you on account of the deeds of others, which you either know nothing of, or else repudiate. But in that we see you separated from the communion of the whole world (a sin both of the greatest magnitude, and manifest to all mankind, and common to you all), if I were desirous of exaggerating, I should find time failing me sooner than words. And if you should seek to defend yourself on this charge, it could only be by bringing accusations against the whole world, of such a kind that, if they could be maintained, you would simply be furnishing matter for further accusation against yourself; if they could not be maintained, there is in them no defence for you. Why therefore do you puff yourself up against me about the betrayal of the sacred books, which concerns neither you nor me if we abide by the agreement not to charge each other with the sins of other men: and which, if that agreement does not stand, affects you rather than me? And, yet, even without any violation of that agreement, I think I may say with perfect justice that he should be deemed a partner with him who delivered up Christ who has not delivered himself up to Christ in company with the whole world. \"Then,\" says the apostle, \"then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.\"[fn-47-P4782_2361273:25-nf] And again he says, \"Heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ.\"[fn-47-P4783_2361356:26-nf] And the same apostle shows that the seed of Abraham belongs to all nations from the promise which was given to Abraham, \"In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.\"[fn-47-P4784_2361557:27-nf] Wherefore I consider that I am only making a fair demand in asking that we should for a moment consider the testament of God, which has already long been opened, and that we should consider every one to be himself an heir of the traitor whom we do not find to be a joint-heir with Him whom he betrayed; that every one should belong to him who sold Christ who denies that Christ has bought the whole world. For when He showed Himself after His resurrection to His disciples, and gave His limbs to those who doubted, that they should handle them, He says this to them, \"For thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead the third day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.\"[fn-47-P4785_2362371:28-nf] See from what an inheritance you estrange yourselves! see what an Heir you resist! Can it really be that a man would spare Christ if He were walking here on earth who speaks against Him while He sits in heaven? Do you not yet understand that whatever you allege against us you allege against His words? A Christian world is promised and believed in: the promise is fulfilled, and it is denied. Consider, I entreat of you, what you ought to suffer for such impiety. And yet, if I know not what you have suffered,-if I have not seen it, have not wrought it,-then do you to-day, who do not suffer the violence of my persecution, render to me an account of your separation.

But the passages which I have advanced to assert the truth of the Catholic Church,, are the following: As regards the question of baptism, that our being born again, cleansed, justified by the grace of God, should not be ascribed to the man who administered the sacrament, I quoted these: \"It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man:\"[fn-58-P5810_2808447:115-nf] and \"Cursed be every one that trusteth in man;\"[fn-58-P5811_2808517:116-nf] and that, \"Salvation belongeth unto the Lord;\"[fn-58-P5812_2808585:117-nf] and that, \"Vain is the help of man;\"[fn-58-P5813_2808641:118-nf] and that, \"Neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase;\"[fn-58-P5814_2808770:119-nf] and that He in whom men believe justifieth the ungodly, that his faith may be counted to him for righteousness.[fn-58-P5815_2808904:120-nf] But in behalf of the unity of the Church itself, which is spread abroad throughout all the world, with which you do not hold communion, I urged that the following passages were prophesied of Christ: that \"He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth;\"[fn-58-P5816_2809221:121-nf] and, \"I shall give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession;\"[fn-58-P5817_2809359:122-nf] and that the covenant of God made with Abraham may be quoted in behalf of our, that is, of the Catholic communion, in which it is written, \"In thy seed shall all nations of the earth be blessed;\"[fn-58-P5818_2809573:123-nf] which seed the apostle interprets, saying, \"And to thy seed, which is Christ.\"[fn-58-P5819_2809674:124-nf] Whence it is evident that in Christ not only Africans or Africa, but all the nations through which the Catholic Church is spread abroad, should receive the blessing which was promised so long before. And that the chaff is to be with the wheat even to the time of the last winnowing, that no one may excuse the sacrilege of his own separation from the Church by calumnious accusations of other men's offenses, if he shall have left or deserted the communion of all nations; and to show that the society of Christians may not be divided on account of evil ministers, that is, evil rulers in the Church, I further quoted the passage, \"All whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works; for they say and do not.\"[fn-58-P5820_2810444:125-nf] With regard to these passages of holy Scripture which I advanced to prove my points, he neither showed how they ought to be otherwise interpreted, so as to prove that they neither made for us nor against you, nor was he willing to touch them in any way.

We cannot possibly believe that spiritual existences can have carnal intercourse with women. But if this could ever have literally happened how is it that it does not now also sometimes take place, and that we do not see some in the same way born of women by the agency of demons without intercourse with men? especially when it is clear that they delight in the pollution of lust, which they would certainly prefer to bring about through their own agency rather than through that of men, if they could possibly manage it, as Ecclesiastes declares: \"What is it that hath been? The same that is. And what is it that hath been done? The same that is done. And there is nothing new that can be said under the sun, so that a man can say: Behold this is new; for it hath already been in the ages which were before us.\"[fn-47-P4734_1718548:36-nf] But the question raised may be resolved in this way. After the death of righteous Abel, in order that the whole human race might not spring from a wicked fratricide, Seth was born in the place of his brother who was slain, to take the place of his brother not only as regards posterity, but also as regards justice and goodness. And his offspring, following the example of their father's goodness, always remained separate from intercourse with and the society of their kindred descended from the wicked Cain, as the difference of the genealogy very clearly tells us, where it says: \"Adam begat Seth, Seth begat Enos, Enos begat Cainan, but Cainan begat Mahalaleel, but Mahalaleel begat Jared, Jared begat Enoch, Enoch begat Methuselah, Methuselah begat Lamech, Lamech begat Noah.\"[fn-47-P4735_1719363:37-nf] And the genealogy of Cain is given separately as follows: \"Cain begat Enoch, Enoch begat Cainan, Cainan begat Mahalaleel, Mahalaleel begat Methuselah, Methuselah begat Lamech, Lamech begat Jabal and Jubal.\"[fn-47-P4736_1719592:38-nf] And so the line which sprang from the seed of righteous Seth always mixed with its own kith and kin, and continued for a long while in the holiness of its fathers and ancestors, untouched by the blasphemies and the wickedness of an evil offspring, which had implanted in it a seed of sin as it were transmitted by its ancestors. As long then as there continued that separation of the lines between them, the seed of Seth, as it sprang from an excellent root, was by reason of its sanctity termed \"angels of God,\" or as some copies have it \"sons of God;\"[fn-47-P4737_1720203:39-nf] and on the contrary the others by reason of their own and their fathers' wickedness and their earthly deeds were termed \"children of men.\" Though then there was up to this time that holy and salutary separation between them, yet after this the sons of Seth who were the sons of God saw the daughters of those who were born of the line of Cain, and inflamed with the desire for their beauty took to themselves from them wives who taught their husbands the wickedness of their fathers, and at once led them astray from their innate holiness and the single-mindedness of their forefathers. To whom this saying applies with sufficient accuracy: \"I have said: Ye are Gods, and ye are all the children of the Most High. But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes;\"[fn-47-P4738_1721005:40-nf] who fell away from that true study of natural philosophy, handed down to them by their ancestors, which the first man who forthwith traced out the study of all nature, could clearly attain to, and transmit to his descendants on sure grounds, inasmuch as he had seen the infancy of this world, while still as it were tender and throbbing and unorganized; and as there was in him not only such fulness of wisdom, but also the grace of prophecy given by the Divine inspiration, so that while he was still an untaught inhabitant of this world he gave names to all living creatures, and not only knew about the fury and poison of all kinds of beasts and serpents, but also distinguished between the virtues of plants and trees and the natures of stones, and the changes of seasons of which he had as vet no experience, so that he could well say: \"The Lord hath given me the true knowledge of the things that are, to know the disposition of the whole world, and the virtues of the elements, the beginning and the ending and the midst of times, the alterations of their courses and the changes of their seasons, the revolutions of the year and the disposition of the stars, the natures of living creatures and the rage of wild beasts, the force of winds, and the reasonings of men, the diversities of plants and the virtues of roots, and all such things as are hid and open I have learnt.\"[fn-47-P4739_1722411:41-nf] This knowledge then of all nature the seed of Seth received through successive generations, handed down from the fathers, so long as it remained separate from the wicked line, and as it had received it in holiness, so it made use of it to promote the glory of God and the needs of everyday life. But when it had been mingled with the evil generation, it drew aside at the suggestion of devils to profane and harmful uses what it had innocently learnt, and audaciously taught by it the curious arts of wizards and enchantments and magical superstitions, teaching its posterity to forsake the holy worship of the Divinity and to honour and worship either the elements or fire or the demons of the air. How it was then that this knowledge of curious arts of which we have spoken, did not perish in the deluge, but became known to the ages that followed, should, I think, be briefly explained, as the occasion of this discussion suggests, although the answer to the question raised scarcely requires it. And so, as ancient traditions tell us, Ham the son of Noah, who had been taught these superstitions and wicked and profane arts, as he knew that he could not possibly bring any handbook on these subjects into the ark, into which he was to enter with his good father and holy brothers, inscribed these nefarious arts and profane devices on plates of various metals which could not be destroyed by the flood of waters, and on hard rocks, and when the flood was over he hunted for them with the same inquisitiveness with which he had concealed them, and so transmitted to his descendants a seed-bed of profanity and perpetual sin. In this way then that common notion, according to which men believe that angels delivered to men enchantments and diverse arts, is in truth fulfilled. From these sons of Seth then and daughters of Cain, as we have said, there were I born still worse children who became mighty, hunters, violent and most fierce men who were termed giants by reason of the size of their bodies and their cruelty and wickedness. For these first began to harass their neighbours and to practise pillaging among men, getting their living rather by rapine than by being contented with the sweat and labour of toil, and their wickedness increased to such a pitch that the world could only be purified by the flood and deluge. So then when the sons of Seth at the instigation of their lust had transgressed that command which had been for a long while kept by a natural instinct from the beginning of the world, it was needful that it should afterwards be restored by the letter of the law: \"Thou shalt not give thy daughter to his son to wife, nor shalt thou take a wife of his daughters to thy son; for they shall seduce your hearts to depart from your God, and to follow their gods and serve them.\"[fn-47-P4740_1725234:42-nf] ","title":"VIII.

For wherefore art thou disturbed? Thine heart is disturbed by the pressing troubles of the world, as that ship was, in which Christ was asleep. Lo! what is the cause, stout-hearted man, that thy heart is disturbed? That ship in which Christ is asleep,[fn-44-P4415_1877391:28-nf] is the heart in which faith is asleep. For what new thing, what new thing, I ask, is told thee, Christian? \"In Christian times is the world laid waste, the world is failing.\" Did not thy Lord tell thee, the world shall be laid waste? Did not thy Lord tell thee, the world shall fail? Why when the promise was made, didst thou believe, and art disturbed now, when it is being completed? So then the tempest beats furiously against thine heart; beware of shipwreck, awake up Christ. The Apostle says, \"that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.\"[fn-44-P4416_1877960:29-nf] Christ dwelleth in thee by faith.

Arise and stir thyself; say, \"Lord, we perish.\" See what the Heathen say to us; and what is, worse, what evil Christians say! Awake up, O Lord, we perish. Let thy faith awake, and Christ begins to speak to thee. \"`Why art thou troubled?' I told thee beforehand of all these things. I foretold them, that when evils came, thou mightest hope for good things, that thou mightest not faint in the evil.\" Wonderest thou that the world is failing? Wonder that the world is grown old. It is as a man who is born, and grows up, and waxes old. There are many complaints in old age; the cough, the rheum, the weakness of the eyes, fretfulness, and weariness. So then as when a man is old; he is full of complaints; so is the world old; and is full of troubles. Is it a little thing that God hath done for thee, in that in the world's old age, He hath sent Christ unto thee, that He may renewthee then, when all is failing? Dost thou not I know that He notified this in the seed of Abraham? \"The seed of Abraham,\" says the Apostle, \"which is Christ.

He came when all things were growing old, and made them new. As a made, created, perishing thing, the world was now declining to its fall. It could not but be that it should abound in troubles; He came both to console thee in the midst of present troubles, and to promise thee everlasting rest. Choose not then to cleave to this aged world, and to be unwilling to grow young in Christ, who telleth thee, \"The world is perishing, the world is waxing old, the world is failing; is distressed by the heavy breathing of old age. But do not fear, \"Thy youth shall be renewed as the eagle's.\"[fn-44-P4419_1879977:32-nf] ","title":"Sermon XXXI. [LXXXI.

Of this pool, which was surrounded with five porches, in which lay a great multitude of sick folk, I remember that I have very often treated; and most of you will with me recollect what I am about to say, rather than gain the knowledge of it for the first time. But it is by no means unprofitable to go back upon matters already known, that both they who know not may be instructed, and they who do know may be confirmed. Therefore, as being already known, these things must be touched upon briefly, not leisurely inculcated. That pool and that water seem to me to have signified the Jewish people. For that peoples are signified under the name of waters the Apocalypse of John clearly indicates to us, where, after he had been shown many waters, and he had asked what they were, was answered that they were peoples.[fn-9-P929_519960:1-nf] That water, then-namely, that people-was shut in by the five books of Moses, as by five porches. But those books brought forth the sick, not healed them. For the law convicted, not acquitted sinners. Accordingly the letter, without grace, made men guilty, whom on confessing grace delivered. For this is what the apostle saith: \"For if a law had been given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.\" Why, then, was the law given?

Because, \"if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.\" Why, then, did the porches contain those whom they did not heal?

For since the being saved, yet with shame, had somewhat of dejection in it, he next takes away this suspicion too. And indeed he has hinted at the same already, by calling it not barely salvation, but \"righteousness. Therein\" (he says) \"is the righteousness of God revealed.\" (Rom. i. 17.) For he that is saved as a righteous man has a confidence accompanying his salvation. And he calls it not \"righteousness\" only, but also the setting forth of the righteousness of God.

And this was quite a vantage ground to insist upon (periousia nikhj pollhj). For for a person who had no works, to be justified by faith, was nothing unlikely. But for a person richly adorned with good deeds, not to be made just from hence, but from faith, this is the thing to cause wonder, and to set the power of faith in a strong light.

Wherefore also he sets him up very high by calling him \"forefather,\" and putting a constraint upon them to comply with him in all points. For, Tell me not, he would say, about the Jews, nor bring this man or that before me. For I will go up to the very head of all, and the source whence circumcision took its rise.

For there are two \"gloryings,\" one of works, and one of faith. After saying then, \"if he was justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God;\" he points out that he might have whereof to glory from faith also,[fn-22-P2274_2224615:4-nf] yea and much greater reason for it. For the great power of Paul is especially displayed in this, that he turns what is objected to the other side, and shows that what seemed rather to be on the side of salvation by works, viz. glorying or boldness of claim (parrhsiazesqai) belonged much more truly to that by faith. For he that glorieth in his works has his own labors to put forward: but he that finds his honor in having faith in God, has a much greater ground for glorying to show, in that it is God that he glorifieth and magnifieth. For those things which the nature of the visible world tells him not of, in receiving these by faith in Him, he at once displays sincere love towards Him, and heralds His power clearly forth. Now this is the character of the noblest soul, and the philosophic[fn-22-P2275_2225482:5-nf] spirit, and lofty mind. For to abstain from stealing and murdering is trifling sort of acquirement, but to believe that it is possible for God to do things impossible requires a soul of no mean stature, and earnestly affected towards Him; for this is a sign of sincere love. For he indeed honors God, who fulfils the commandments, but he doth so in a much greater degree who thus followeth wisdom (filosofwn) by his faith. The former obeys Him, but the latter receives that opinion of Him which is fitting, and glorifies Him, and feels wonder at Him more than that evinced by works. For that glorying pertains to him that does aright, but this glorifieth God, and lieth wholly in Him. For he glorieth at conceiving great things concerning Him, which redound to His glory. And this is why he speaks of having whereof to glory before God. And not for this only, but also for another reason: for he who is a believer glorieth again, not only because he loveth God in sincerity, but also because he hath enjoyed great honor and love from him. For as be shows his love to Him by having great thoughts about Him, (for this is a proof of love), so doth God also love him, though deserving to suffer for countless sins, not in freeing him from punishment only, but even by making him righteous. He then hath whereof to glory, as having been counted worthy of mighty love.","title":"Homily VIII.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":3,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_72_homily_viii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"He had said (5 mss. eipen), that the world had become guilty before God, and that all had sinned, and that boasting was excluded and that it was impossible to be saved otherwise than by faith.

For the great power of Paul is especially displayed in this, that he turns what is objected to the other side, and shows that what seemed rather to be on the side of salvation by works, viz. glorying or boldness of claim (parrhsiazesqai) belonged much more truly to that by faith. For he that glorieth in his works has his own labors to put forward: but he that finds his honor in having faith in God, has a much greater ground for glorying to show, in that it is God that he glorifieth and magnifieth. For those things which the nature of the visible world tells him not of, in receiving these by faith in Him, he at once displays sincere love towards Him, and heralds His power clearly forth. Now this is the character of the noblest soul, and the philosophic[fn-22-P2275_2225482:5-nf] spirit, and lofty mind. For to abstain from stealing and murdering is trifling sort of acquirement, but to believe that it is possible for God to do things impossible requires a soul of no mean stature, and earnestly affected towards Him; for this is a sign of sincere love.

For that glorying pertains to him that does aright, but this glorifieth God, and lieth wholly in Him. For he glorieth at conceiving great things concerning Him, which redound to His glory.

Wherefore also he sets him up very high by calling him \"forefather,\" and putting a constraint upon them to comply with him in all points. For, Tell me not, he would say, about the Jews, nor bring this man or that before me. For I will go up to the very head of all, and the source whence circumcision took its rise. For \"if Abraham,\" he says, \"was justified by works, he hath whereof to glory: but not before God.\"[fn-22-P2273_2223939:3-nf] What is here said is not plain, and so one must make it plainer. For there are two \"gloryings,\" one of works, and one of faith. After saying then, \"if he was justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God;\" he points out that he might have whereof to glory from faith also,[fn-22-P2274_2224615:4-nf] yea and much greater reason for it. For the great power of Paul is especially displayed in this, that he turns what is objected to the other side, and shows that what seemed rather to be on the side of salvation by works, viz. glorying or boldness of claim (parrhsiazesqai) belonged much more truly to that by faith. For he that glorieth in his works has his own labors to put forward: but he that finds his honor in having faith in God, has a much greater ground for glorying to show, in that it is God that he glorifieth and magnifieth. For those things which the nature of the visible world tells him not of, in receiving these by faith in Him, he at once displays sincere love towards Him, and heralds His power clearly forth. Now this is the character of the noblest soul, and the philosophic[fn-22-P2275_2225482:5-nf] spirit, and lofty mind. For to abstain from stealing and murdering is trifling sort of acquirement, but to believe that it is possible for God to do things impossible requires a soul of no mean stature, and earnestly affected towards Him; for this is a sign of sincere love. For he indeed honors God, who fulfils the commandments, but he doth so in a much greater degree who thus followeth wisdom (filosofwn) by his faith. The former obeys Him, but the latter receives that opinion of Him which is fitting, and glorifies Him, and feels wonder at Him more than that evinced by works. For that glorying pertains to him that does aright, but this glorifieth God, and lieth wholly in Him. For he glorieth at conceiving great things concerning Him, which redound to His glory. And this is why he speaks of having whereof to glory before God. And not for this only, but also for another reason: for he who is a believer glorieth again, not only because he loveth God in sincerity, but also because he hath enjoyed great honor and love from him. For as be shows his love to Him by having great thoughts about Him, (for this is a proof of love), so doth God also love him, though deserving to suffer for countless sins, not in freeing him from punishment only, but even by making him righteous. He then hath whereof to glory, as having been counted worthy of mighty love.","title":"Homily VIII.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":3,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_72_homily_viii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"He had said (5 mss. eipen), that the world had become guilty before God, and that all had sinned, and that boasting was excluded and that it was impossible to be saved otherwise than by faith. He is now intent upon showing that this salvation, so far from being matter of shame, was even the cause of a bright glory, and a greater than that through works. For since the being saved, yet with shame, had somewhat of dejection in it, he next takes away this suspicion too. And indeed he has hinted at the same already, by calling it not barely salvation, but \"righteousness. Therein\" (he says) \"is the righteousness of God revealed.\" (Rom. i. 17.) For he that is saved as a righteous man has a confidence accompanying his salvation. And he calls it not \"righteousness\" only, but also the setting forth of the righteousness of God. But God is set forth in things which are glorious and shining, and great. However, he nevertheless draws support for this from what he is at present upon, and carries his discourse forward by the method of question. And this he is always in the habit of doing both for clearness sake, and for the sake of confidence in what is said. Above, for instance, he did it, where he says, \"What advantage then hath the Jew?\" (ib. iii. 1.) and, \"What then have we more than they?\"[fn-22-P2271_2221576:1-nf] (ib. 9) and again, \"where then is boasting? it is excluded\" (Rom. iii. 27): and here, \"what then shall we say that Abraham our father?\" etc. Now since the Jews kept turning over and over the fact, that the Patriarch, and friend of God, was the first to receive circumcision, he wishes to show, that it was by faith that he too was justified. And this was quite a vantage ground to insist upon (periousia nikhj pollhj). For for a person who had no works, to be justified by faith, was nothing unlikely. But for a person richly adorned with good deeds, not to be made just from hence, but from faith, this is the thing to cause wonder, and to set the power of faith in a strong light. And this is why he passes by all the others, and leads his discourse back to this man. And he calls him \"father, as pertaining to the flesh,\" to throw them out of the genuine relationship (suggeneiaj gnhsiaj) to him, and to pave the Gentiles' way to kinsmanship[fn-22-P2272_2222683:2-nf] with him.

At his suggestion then ye have maintained and ye think, that `there was once when the Son was not;' this is the first cloke of your views of doctrine which has to be stripped off Say then what was once when the Son was not, O slanderous and irreligious men[fn-53-P5347_2095608:61-nf] ? If ye say the Father, your blasphemy is but greater; for it is impious to say that He was `once,' or to signify Him by the word `once.' For He is ever, and is now, and as the Son is, so is He, and is Himself He that is, and Father of the Son. But if ye say that the Son was once, when He Himself was not, the answer is foolish and unmeaning. For how could He both be and not be? In this difficulty, you can but answer, that there was a time when the Word was not; for your very adverb `once' naturally signifies this. And your other, `The Son was not before His generation,' is equivalent to saying, `There was once when He was not,' for both the one and the other signify that there is a time before the Word. Whence then this your discovery? Why do ye, as `the heathen, rage, and imagine vain phrases against the Lord[fn-53-P5348_2097288:62-nf] and against His Christ?' for no holy Scripture has used such language of the Saviour, but rather `always' and `eternal' and `coexistent always with the Father.'

Surely in these words he does not designate the Father, as ye often whisper one to another, affirming that the Father is `His eternal power.' This is not so; for he says not, `God Himself is the power,' but `His is the power.' Very plain is it to all that `His' is not `He;' yet not something alien but rather proper to Him.

Listen to the apostle: \"To Abraham and to his seed were the promises made. He saith not,\" he adds, \"And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.\"[fn-17-P1787_1128007:3-nf] We then have become Abraham's seed by the grace of God.

The five porches in which the infirm folk lay signify the Law, which was first given to the Jews and to the people of Israel by Moses the servant of God. For this Moses the minister of the Law wrote five books. In relation therefore to the number of the books which he wrote, the five porches figured the Law. But because the Law was not given to heal the infirm, but to discover and to manifest them; for so saith the Apostle, \"For if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the Law; But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe;\"[fn-59-P5945_2516913:2-nf] therefore in those porches the sick folk lay, but were not cured. For what saith he? \"If there had been a law given which could have given life.\" Therefore those porches which figured the Law could not cure the sick. Some one will say to me, \"Why then was it given?\" The Apostle Paul hath himself explained: \"Scripture,\" saith he, \"hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.\" For these folk who were sick, thought themselves to be whole. They received the Law, which they were not able to fulfil; they learnt in what disease they were, and they implored the Physician's aid; they wished to be cured because they came to know they were in distress, which they would not have known if they had not been unable to fulfil the Law which had been given. For man thought himself innocent, and from this very pride of false innocence became more mad. To tame this pride then and to lay it bare, the Law was given; not to deliver the sick, but to convince the proud. Attend then, Beloved; to this end was the Law given, to discover diseases, not to take them away. And so then those sick folk who might have been sick in their own houses with greater privacy, if those five porches had not existed, were in those porches set forth to the eyes of all men, but were not by the porches cured. The Law therefore was useful to discover sins, because that man being made more abundantly guilty by the transgression of the Law, might, having tamed his pride, implore the help of Him That pitieth. Attend to the Apostle; \"The Law entered that sin might abound; but where sin abounded, grace hath much more abounded.\"[fn-59-P5946_2518600:3-nf] What is, \"The Law entered that sin might abound \"? As in another place he saith, \"For where there is no law, there is no transgression.\"[fn-59-P5947_2518752:4-nf] Man may be called a sinner before the Law, a transgressor he cannot. But when he hath sinned, after that he hath received the Law, he is found not only a sinner, but a transgressor. Forasmuch then as to sin is added transgression, therefore \"hath sin abounded.\" And when sin abounds, human pride learns at length to submit itself, and to confess to God, and to say \"I am weak\" To say to those words of the Psalm which none but the humbled soul saith, \"I said, Lord, be merciful unto me; heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.\"[fn-59-P5948_2519302:5-nf] Let the weak soul then say this that is at least convinced by transgression, and not cured, but manifested by the Law. Hear too Paul himself showing thee, both that the Law is good, and yet that nothing but the grace of Christ delivereth from sin. For the Law can prohibit and command; apply the medicine, that that which doth not allow a man to fulfil the Law, may be cured, it cannot, but grace only doeth that. For the Apostle saith, \"For I delight in the Law of Godafter the inner man.\"[fn-59-P5949_2519808:6-nf] That is, I see now that what the Law blames is evil, and what the Law commands is good. \"For I delight in the Law of God after the inner man. I see another law in my members resisting the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity in the law of sin.\" This derived from the punishment of sin, from the propagation of death, from the condemnation of Adam, \"resists the law of the mind, and brings it into captivity in the law of sin which is in the members.\" He was convinced; he received the Law, that he might be convinced: see now what profit it was to him that he was convinced. Hear the following words,\" \"Wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?

For actions not done lawfully and piously, are not of advantage, though they may be reputed to be so, but they rather argue hypocrisy in those who venture upon them.

The prophet, therefore, cried against them, saying, `Falsehood and faithlessness have prevailed among them.' The Lord also therefore said concerning them, `The strange children have dealt falsely with Me; the strange children have waxen old[fn-95-P9559_3444139:13-nf] .' But how gently does He reprove them, saying, `Had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed Me, for he wrote of Me[fn-95-P9560_3444274:14-nf] .' But being faithless, they went on to deal falsely with the law, affirming things after their own pleasure, but not understanding the Scripture; and, further, as they had hypocritically made a pretence of the plain text of Scripture, and had confidence in this, He is angry with them, saying by Isaiah, `Who hath required these of your hands[fn-95-P9561_3444634:15-nf] ?' And by Jeremiah, since they were very bold, he threatens, `Gather together your whole burnt-offerings with your sacrifices, and eat flesh, for I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices[fn-95-P9562_3444968:16-nf] .' For they did not act as was right, neither was their zeal according to law, but they rather sought their own pleasure in such days, as the prophet accuses them, beating clown their bondsmen, and gathering themselves together for strifes and quarrels, and they smote the lowly with the fist, and did all things that tended to their own gratification. For this cause, they continue without a feast until the end, although they make a display now of eating flesh, out of place and out of season. For, instead of the legally-appointed lamb, they have learned to sacrifice to Baal; instead of the true unleavened bread, `they collect the wood, and their fathers kindle the fire, and their wives prepare the dough, that they may make cakes to the host of heaven, and pour out libations to strange gods, that they may provoke Me to anger, saith the Lord[fn-95-P9563_3445836:17-nf] .'

He is Man and God; the One Christ is Man and God; as one man is soul and body: but God and Man are not two Persons. In Christ indeed there are two substances, God and Man; but one Person, that the Trinity may remain, and that there be not a quaternity introduced by the addition of the human[fn-62-P6248_2645237:10-nf] nature. How then can it be that God should not have mercy upon us, for whose sake God was made Man? Much is that which He hath done already; more wonderful is that which He hath done, than what He hath promised; and by that which He hath done, ought we to believe what He hath promised. For that which He hath done, we should scarcely believe, unless we also saw it. Where do we see it? In the peoples that believe, in the multitude that has been brought unto Him. For that hath been fulfilled which was promised to Abraham;[fn-62-P6249_2645822:11-nf] and from these things which we see, we believe what we do not see. Abraham was one single man, and to him was it said, \"In thy seed shall all nations be blessed.\" If he had looked to himself, when would he have believed? He was one single man, and was now old; and he had a barren wife, and one who was so far advanced in age, that she could not conceive, even though she had not been barren. There was nothing at all from which any hope could be drawn. But he looked to Him That gave the promise, and believed what he did not see. Lo, what he believed, we see. Therefore from these things which we see, we ought to believe what we see not. He begat Isaac, we saw it not; and Isaac begat Jacob, and this we did not see; and Jacob begat twelve sons, and them we saw not; and his twelve sons begat the people of Israel; this great people we see. I have now begun to mention those things which we do see. Of the people of Israel was born the Virgin Mary, and she gave birth to Christ; and, lo, in Christ all nations are blessed. What more true? more certain? more plain? Together with me,long after the world to come, ye who have beengathered together out of the nations. In this world hath God fulfilled His promise concerning the seed of Abraham. How shall He not give us His eternal promises, whom He hath made to be Abraham's seed?

Thus, to take an example, after God had made the world, and all things that are in it, in the space of six days, He rested on the seventh day from all His works by which statement I do not mean to affirm that He rested because He was fatigued, but that He did so as having brought to its perfection every creature which He had resolved to introduce. And yet in the sequel it, the new law, says: \"My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.\"[fn-35-P3547_973554:278-nf] Does that mean, then, that He is still making heaven, or sun, or man, or animals, or trees, or any such thing? Nay; but the meaning is, that when these visible objects were perfectly finished, He rested from that kind of work; while, however, He still continues to work at objects invisible with an inward mode of action,[fn-35-P3548_973895:279-nf] and saves men. In like manner, then, the legislator desires also that every individual amongst us should be devoted unceasingly to this kind of work, even as God Himself is; and he enjoins us consequently to rest continuously from secular things, and to engage in no worldly sort of work whatsoever; and this is called our Sabbath. This also he added in the law, that nothing senseless[fn-35-P3549_974390:280-nf] should be done but that we should be careful and direct our life in accordance with what is just and righteous. Now this law was suspended over men, discharging most sharply its curse against those who might transgress it. But because its subjects, too, were but men, and because, as happens also frequently I with us, controversies arose and injuries were inflicted, the law likewise at once, and with the severest equity, made any wrong that was done return upon the head of the wrong-doer;[fn-35-P3550_974964:281-nf] so that, for instance, if a poor man was minded to gather a bundle of wood upon the Sabbath, he was placed under the curse of the law, and exposed to the penality of instant death.[fn-35-P3551_975286:282-nf] The men, therefore, who had been brought up with the Egyptians were thus severely pressed by the restrictive power of the law, and they were unable to bear the penalties and the curses of the law. But, again, He who is ever the Saviour, our Lord Jesus Christ, came and delivered those men from these pains and curses of the law, forgiving them their offences. And He indeed did not deal with them as Moses did, putting the severities of the law in force, and granting indulgence to no man for any offence; but He declared that if any man suffered an injury at the hands of his neighbour, he was to forgive him not once only, nor even twice or thrice, nor only seven times, but even unto seventy times seven;[fn-35-P3552_976014:283-nf] but that, on the other hand, if after all this the offender still continued to do such wrong, he ought then, as the last resource, to be brought under the law of Moses, and that no further pardon should be granted to the man who would thus persist in wrong-doing, even after having been forgiven unto seventy times seven. And He bestowed His forgiveness not only on a transgressor of such a character as that, but even on one who did offence to the Son of man. But if a man dealt thus with the Holy Spirit, He made him subject to two curses,-namely, to that of the law of Moses, and to that of His own law; to the law of Moses in truth in this present life, but to His own law at the time of the judgment: for His word is this: \"It shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.\"[fn-35-P3553_976851:284-nf] There is the law of Moses, thus, that in this world gives pardon to no such person; and there is the law of Christ that punishes in the future world. From this, therefore, mark how He confirms the law, not only not destroying it, but fulfilling it. Thus, then, He redeemed them from that curse of the law which belongs to the present life; and from this fact has come the appellation \"the curse of the law.\" This is the whole account which needs be given of that mode of speech. But, again, why the law is called the \"strength of sin, we shall at once explain in brief to the best of our ability. Now it is written that \"the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners.\"[fn-35-P3554_977606:285-nf] In these times, then, before Moses, there was no written law for transgressors; whence also Pharaoh, not knowing the strength of sin, transgressed in the way of afflicting the children of Israel with unrighteous burdens, and despised the Godhead, not only himself, but also all who were with him. But, not to make any roundabout statement, I shall explain the matter briefly as follows. There were certain persons of the Egyptian race mingling with the people of Moses, when that people was under his rule in the desert; and when Moses had taken his position on the mount, with the purpose of receiving the law, the impatient people, I do not mean those who were the true Israel, but those who had been intermixed with the Egyptians,[fn-35-P3555_978360:286-nf] set up a calf as their god, in accordance with their ancient custom of worshipping idols, with the notion that by such means they might secure themselves against ever having to pay the proper penalties for their iniquities.[fn-35-P3556_979141:287-nf] Thus were they altogether ignorant of the strength of their sin. But when Moses returned (from the mount) and found that out, he issued orders that those men should be put to death with the sword. From that occasion a beginning was made ill the correct perception of the strength of sin on the part of these persons through the instrumentality of the law of Moses, and for that reason the law has been called the \"strength of sin.\"","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":3,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"60","folder":"ANF-06","text":"49. But in addition to all that has been said already, I wish to adduce still further proof, so that all may understand what impiety is contained in this assertion of yours. For if your allegation is true, that He was not born, then it will follow undoubtedly that He did not suffer; for it is not possible for one to suffer who was not also born. But if He did not suffer, then the name of the cross is done away with. And if the cross was not endured, then Jesus did not rise from the dead. And if Jesus rose not from the dead, then no other person will rise again. And if no one shall rise again, then there will be no judgment. For it is certain that, if I am not to rise again, I cannot be judged. But if there is to be no judgment, then the keeping of God's commandments will be to no purpose, and there will be no occasion for abstinence: nay, we may say, \"Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we shall die.\"[fn-38-P3885_1105023:596-nf] For all these consequences follow when you deny that He was born of Mary. But if you acknowledge that He was born of Mary, then His passion will necessarily follow, and His resurrection will be consequent on His passion, and the judgment on His resurrection: and thus the injunctions of Scripture will have their proper value[fn-38-P3886_1105371:597-nf] for us. This is not therefore an idle question, but there are the mightiest issues involved in this word. For just as all the law and the prophets are summed up in two words, so also all our hope is made to depend on the birth by the blessed Mary. Give me therefore an answer to these several questions which I shall address to you. How shall we get rid of these many words of the apostle, so important and so precise, which are expressed in terms like the following: \"But when the good pleasure of God was with us, He sent His Son, made of a woman; \"[fn-38-P3887_1105938:598-nf] and again, \"Christ our passover is sacrificed for us; \"[fn-38-P3888_1106264:599-nf] and once more, \"God hath both raised up the Lord, and will raise up us together with Him by His own power? \"[fn-38-P3889_1106393:600-nf] And there are many other passages of a similar import; as, for example, this which follows: \"How say some among you,[fn-38-P3890_1106855:601-nf] that there is no resurrection of the dead? For if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is not Christ risen: and if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain. Yea, and we shall be found false witnesses of God; who have testified against God that He raised up Christ: whom He raised not up. For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ risen: and if Christ be not raised, your[fn-38-P3891_1107328:602-nf] faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins: Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are more miserable than all men. But now is Christ risen from the dead, the beginning[fn-38-P3892_1107639:603-nf] of them that sleep; \"[fn-38-P3893_1107677:604-nf] and so on. Who, then, I ask, can be found so rash and audacious as not to make his faith fit in with these sacred words, in which there is no qualification[fn-38-P3894_1107858:605-nf] nor any dubiety? Who, I ask you, O foolish Galatian, has bewitched you, as those were bewitched \"before whose eyes Jesus Christ was evidently set forth, crucified? \"[fn-38-P3895_1108043:606-nf] From all this I think that these testimonies should suffice in proof of the judgment, and the resurrection, and the passion; and the birth by Mary is also shown to be involved naturally and at once in these facts. And what matters it though you refuse to acquiesce in this, when the Scripture proclaims the fact most unmistakeably? Nevertheless I shall again put a question to you, and let it please you to give me an answer. When Jesus gave His testimony concerning John, and said, \"Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding, he that is less[fn-38-P3896_1108777:607-nf] in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he,\"[fn-38-P3897_1108837:608-nf] tell me what is meant by there being a greater than he in the kingdom of heaven. Was Jesus less in the kingdom of heaven than John? I say, God forbid! Tell me, then, how this is to be explained, and you will certainly surpass yourself. Without doubt the meaning is, that Jesus was less than John among those that are born of woman; but in the kingdom of heaven He is greater than he.[fn-38-P3898_1109242:609-nf] Wherefore tell me this too, O Manichaeus: If you say that Christ was not born of Mary, but that He only appeared like a man, while yet He was not really a man, the appearance being effected and produced by the power that is in Him, tell me, I repeat, on whom then was it that the Spirit descended like a dove? Who is this that was baptized by John? If He was perfect, if He was the Son, if He was the Power, the Spirit could not have entered into Him;[fn-38-P3899_1109977:610-nf] just as a kingdom cannot enter within a kingdom. And whose, too, was that voice which was sent forth out of heaven, and which gave Him this testimony, \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased? \"[fn-39-P3900_1110992:611-nf] Come, tell me; make no delay; who is this that acquires[fn-39-P3901_1111070:612-nf] all these things, that does all these things?

For if Abraham believed in God, and it was accounted unto him for righteousness, assuredly whosoever believes in God and lives in faith is found righteous, and already is blessed in faithful Abraham, and is set forth as justified; as the blessed Apostle Paul proves, when he says, \"Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.

For though the Holy Spirit imparted fertility to the Virgin, yet a real body was received from her body; and, \"Wisdom building her a house[fn-10-P1091_255618:21-nf] ,\" \"the Word became flesh and dwelt in us[fn-10-P1092_255677:22-nf] ,\" that is, in that flesh which he took from man and which he quickened with the breath of a higher life[fn-10-P1093_255935:23-nf] .

Let them tell me in what sense Paul says, \"Now we know in part\";[fn-54-P5475_1725560:4-nf] do we know His essence in part, as knowing parts of His essence? No. This is absurd; for God is without parts. But do we know the whole essence? How then \"When that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.\"[fn-54-P5476_1725818:5-nf] Why are idolaters found fault with? Is it not because they knew God and did not honour Him as God? Why are the \"foolish Galatians\"[fn-54-P5477_1725969:6-nf] reproached by Paul in the words, \"After that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements?\"[fn-54-P5478_1726131:7-nf] How was God known in Jewry? Was it because in Jewry it was known what His essence is? \"The ox,\" it is said, \"knoweth his owner.\"[fn-54-P5479_1726275:8-nf] According to your argument the ox knows his lord's essence. \"And the ass his master's crib.\"[fn-54-P5480_1726381:9-nf] So the ass knows the essence of the crib, but \"Israel doth not know me.\" So, according to you, Israel is found fault with for not knowing what the essence of God is. \"Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee,\"[fn-54-P5481_1726625:10-nf] that is, who have not comprehended thy essence. But, I repeat, knowledge is manifold-it involves perception of our Creator, recognition of His wonderful works, observance of His commandments and intimate communion with Him. All this they thrust on one side and force knowledge into one single meaning, the contemplation of God's essence. Thou shall put them, it is said, before the testimony and I shall be known of thee thence.[fn-54-P5482_1727073:11-nf] Is the term, \"I shall be known of thee,\" instead of, \"I will reveal my essence\"? \"The Lord knoweth them that are his.\"[fn-54-P5483_1727305:12-nf] Does He know the essence of them that are His, but is ignorant of the essence of those who disobey Him ? \"Adam knew his wife.\"[fn-54-P5484_1727452:13-nf] Did he know her essence? It is said of Rebekah \"She was a virgin, neither had any man known her,\"[fn-54-P5485_1727567:14-nf] and \"How shall this be seeing I know not a man?\"[fn-54-P5486_1727636:15-nf] Did no man know Rebekah's essence ? Does Mary mean \"I do not know the essence of any man\" ? Is it not the custom of Scripture to use the word \"know\" of nuptial embraces? The statement that God shall he known from the mercy seat means that He will be known to His worshippers. And the Lord knoweth them that are His, means that on account of their good works He receives them into intimate communion with Him.","title":"Letter CCXXXV.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":3,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_279_letter_cclxi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"I Have received the letter which you, right honourable brethren, have sent me concerning the circumstances in which you are placed.
