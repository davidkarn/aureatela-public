{"verses":["King Nabuchodonosor made a statue of gold, of sixty cubits high,\nand six cubits broad, and he set it up in the plain of Dura, of the\nprovince of Babylon.","Then Nabuchodonosor, the king, sent to call together the nobles,\nthe magistrates, and the judges, the captains, the rulers, and\ngovernors, and all the chief men of the provinces, to come to the\ndedication of the statue which king Nabuchodonosor had set up.","Then the nobles, the magistrates, and the judges, the captains,\nand rulers, and the great men that were placed in authority, and all\nthe princes of the provinces, were gathered together to come to the\ndedication of the statue, which king Nabuchodonosor had set up.  And\nthey stood before the statue which king Nabuchodonosor had set up.","Then a herald cried with a strong voice:  To you it is commanded, O\nnations, tribes and languages:","That in the hour that you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, and\nof the flute, and of the harp, of the sackbut, and of the psaltery, and\nof the symphony, and of all kind of music, ye fall down and adore the\ngolden statue which king Nabuchodonosor hath set up.","But if any man shall not fall down and adore, he shall the same\nhour be cast into a furnace of burning fire.","Upon this, therefore, at the time when all the people heard the\nsound of the trumpet, the flute, and the harp, of the sackbut, and the\npsaltery, of the symphony, and of all kind of music, all the nations,\ntribes, and languages fell down and adored the golden statue which king\nNabuchodonosor had set up.","And presently at that very time some Chaldeans came and accused\nthe Jews,","And said to king Nabuchodonosor:  O king, live for ever:","Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear\nthe sound of the trumpet, the flute, and the harp, of the sackbut, and\nthe psaltery, of the symphony, and of all kind of music, shall\nprostrate himself, and adore the golden statue:","And that if any man shall not fall down and adore, he should be\ncast into a furnace of burning fire.","Now there are certain Jews, whom thou hast set over the works of\nthe province of Babylon, Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago:  these men, O\nking, have slighted thy decree:  they worship not thy gods, nor do they\nadore the golden statue which thou hast set up.","Then Nabuchodonosor in fury, and in wrath, commanded that\nSidrach, Misach, and Abdenago should be brought:  who immediately were\nbrought before the king.","And Nabuchodonosor, the king, spoke to them, and said:  Is it\ntrue, O Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, that you do not worship my gods,\nnor adore the golden statue that I have set up?","Now, therefore, if you be ready, at what hour soever, you shall\nhear the sound of the trumpet, flute, harp, sackbut, and psaltery, and\nsymphony, and of all kind of music, prostrate yourselves, and adore the\nstatue which I have made:  but if you do not adore, you shall be cast\nthe same hour into the furnace of burning fire:  and who is the God that\nshall deliver you out of my hand?","Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, answered, and said to king\nNabuchodonosor:  We have no occasion to answer thee concerning this\nmatter.","For behold our God, whom we worship, is able to save us from the\nfurnace of burning fire, and to deliver us out of thy hands, O king.","But if he will not, be it known to thee, O king, that we will not\nworship thy gods, nor adore the golden statue which thou hast set up.","Then was Nabuchodonosor filled with fury:  and the countenance of\nhis face was changed against Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, and he\ncommanded that the furnace should be heated seven times more than it\nhad been accustomed to be heated.","And he commanded the strongest men that were in his army, to bind\nthe feet of Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, and to cast them into the\nfurnace of burning fire.","And immediately these men were bound, and were cast into the\nfurnace of burning fire, with their coats, and their caps, and their\nshoes, and their garments.","For the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace was heated\nexceedingly.  And the flame of the fire slew those men that had cast in\nSidrach, Misach, and Abdenago.","But these three men, that is, Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, fell\ndown bound in the midst of the furnace of burning fire.","And they walked in the midst of the flame, praising God, and\nblessing the Lord.","Then Azarias standing up, prayed in this manner, and opening his\nmouth in the midst of the fire, he said:","Blessed art thou, O Lord, the God of our fathers, and thy name is\nworthy of praise, and glorious for ever:","For thou art just in all that thou hast done to us, and all thy\nworks are true, and thy ways right, and all thy judgments true.","For thou hast executed true judgments in all the things that thou\nhast brought upon us, and upon Jerusalem, the holy city of our fathers:\nfor according to truth and judgment, thou hast brought all these things\nupon us for our sins.","For we have sinned, and committed iniquity, departing from thee:\nand we have trespassed in all things:","And we have not hearkened to thy commandments, nor have we\nobserved nor done as thou hadst commanded us, that it might go well\nwith us.","Wherefore, all that thou hast brought upon us, and every thing\nthat thou hast done to us, thou hast done in true judgment:","And thou hast delivered us into the hands of our enemies that are\nunjust, and most wicked, and prevaricators, and to a king unjust, and\nmost wicked beyond all that are upon the earth.","And now we cannot open our mouths:  we are become a shame, and a\nreproach to thy servants, and to them that worship thee.","Deliver us not up for ever, we beseech thee, for thy name's sake,\nand abolish not thy covenant.","And take not away thy mercy from us, for the sake of Abraham, thy\nbeloved, and Isaac, thy servant, and Israel, thy holy one:","To whom thou hast spoken, promising that thou wouldst multiply\ntheir seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is on the sea\nshore.","For we, O Lord, are diminished more than any nation, and are\nbrought low in all the earth this day for our sins.","Neither is there at this time prince, or leader, or prophet, or\nholocaust, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place of first\nfruits before thee,","That we may find thy mercy:  nevertheless, in a contrite heart and\nhumble spirit let us be accepted.","As in holocausts of rams, and bullocks, and as in thousands of\nfat lambs:  so let our sacrifice be made in thy sight this day, that it\nmay please thee:  for there is no confusion to them that trust in thee.","And now we follow thee with all our heart, and we fear thee, and\nseek thy face.","Put us not to confusion, but deal with us according to thy\nmeekness, and according to the multitude of thy mercies.","And deliver us, according to thy wonderful works, and give glory\nto thy name, O Lord:","And let all them be confounded that shew evils to thy servants,\nlet them be confounded in all thy might, and let their strength be\nbroken:","And let them know that thou art the Lord, the only God, and\nglorious over all the world.","Now the king's servants that had cast them in, ceased not to heat\nthe furnace with brimstone and tow, and pitch, and dry sticks,","And the flame mounted up above the furnace nine and forty cubits:","And it broke forth, and burnt such of the Chaldeans as it found\nnear the furnace.","But the angel of the Lord went down with Azarias and his\ncompanions into the furnace:  and he drove the flame of the fire out of\nthe furnace,","And made the midst of the furnace like the blowing of a wind\nbringing dew, and the fire touched them not at all, nor troubled them,\nnor did them any harm.","Then these three, as with one mouth, praised and glorified and\nblessed God, in the furnace, saying:","Blessed art thou, O Lord, the God of our fathers; and worthy to\nbe praised, and glorified, and exalted above all for ever:  and blessed\nis the holy name of thy glory:  and worthy to be praised and exalted\nabove all, in all ages.","Blessed art thou in the holy temple of thy glory:  and exceedingly\nto be praised and exalted above all for ever.","Blessed art thou that beholdest the depths, and sittest upon the\ncherubims:  and worthy to be praised and exalted above all for ever.","Blessed art thou in the firmament of heaven:  and worthy of\npraise, and glorious for ever.","All ye works of the Lord, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him\nabove all for ever.","O ye angels of the Lord, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him\nabove all for ever.","O ye heavens, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all for\never.","O all ye waters that are above the heavens, bless the Lord:\npraise and exalt him above all for ever.","O all ye powers of the Lord, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him\nabove all for ever.","O ye sun and moon, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all\nfor ever.","O ye stars of heaven, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above\nall for ever.","O every shower and dew, bless ye the Lord:  praise and exalt him\nabove all for ever.","O all ye spirits of God, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him\nabove all for ever.","O ye fire and heat, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above\nall for ever.","O ye cold and heat, bless the Lord, praise and exalt him above\nall for ever.","O ye dews and hoar frost, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him\nabove all for ever.","O ye frost and cold, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above\nall for ever.","O ye ice and snow, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all\nfor ever.","O ye nights and days, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above\nall for ever.","O ye light and darkness, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him\nabove all for ever.","O ye lightnings and clouds, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him\nabove all for ever.","O let the earth bless the Lord:  let it praise and exalt him above\nall for ever.","O all ye things that spring up in the earth, bless the Lord:\npraise and exalt him above all for ever.","O ye fountains, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all\nfor ever.","O ye seas and rivers, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above\nall for ever.","O ye whales, and all that move in the waters, bless the Lord:\npraise and exalt him above all for ever.","O all ye fowls of the air, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him\nabove all for ever.","O all ye beasts and cattle, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him\nabove all for ever.","O ye sons of men, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him above all\nfor ever.","O let Israel bless the Lord:  let them praise and exalt him above\nall for ever.","O ye priests of the Lord, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him\nabove all for ever.","O ye servants of the Lord, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt him\nabove all for ever.","O ye spirits and souls of the just, bless the Lord:  praise and\nexalt him above all for ever.","O ye holy and humble of heart, bless the Lord:  praise and exalt\nhim above all for ever.","O Ananias, Azarias, Misael, bless ye the Lord:  praise and exalt\nhim above all for ever.  For he hath delivered us from hell, and saved us\nout of the hand of death, and delivered us out of the midst of the\nburning flame, and saved us out of the midst of the fire.","O give thanks to the Lord, because he is good:  because his mercy\nendureth for ever and ever.","O all ye religious, bless the Lord, the God of gods:  praise him,\nand give him thanks, because his mercy endureth for ever and ever.","Then Nabuchodonosor, the king, was astonished, and rose up in\nhaste, and said to his nobles:  Did we not cast three men bound into the\nmidst of the fire?  They answered the king, and said:  True, O king.","He answered, and said:  Behold, I see four men loose, and walking\nin the midst of the fire, and there is no hurt in them, and the form of\nthe fourth is like the son of God.","Then Nabuchodonosor came to the door of the burning fiery\nfurnace, and said:  Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, ye servants of the\nmost high God, go ye forth, and come.  And immediately Sidrach, Misach,\nand Abdenago, went out from the midst of the fire.","And the nobles, and the magistrates, and the judges, and the\ngreat men of the king, being gathered together, considered these men,\nthat the fire had no power on their bodies, and that not a hair of\ntheir head had been singed, nor their garments altered, nor the smell\nof the fire had passed on them.","Then Nabuchodonosor breaking forth, said:  Blessed be the God of\nthem, to wit, of Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, who hath sent his\nangel, and delivered his servants that believed in him:  and they\nchanged the king's word, and delivered up their bodies, that they might\nnot serve nor adore any god except their own God.","By me, therefore, this decree is made:  That every people, tribe,\nand tongue, which shall speak blasphemy against the God of Sidrach,\nMisach, and Abdenago, shall be destroyed, and their houses laid waste:\nfor there is no other God that can save in this manner.","Then the king promoted Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, in the\nprovince of Babylon.","Nabuchodonosor, the king, to all peoples, nations, and tongues,\nthat dwell in all the earth, peace be multiplied unto you.","The most high God hath wrought signs and wonders towards me.  It\nhath seemed good to me, therefore, to publish","His signs, because they are great:  and his wonders, because they\nare mighty:  and his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his power to\nall generations."]}
