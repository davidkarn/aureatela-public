{"verses":["In the second year of the reign of Nabuchodonosor, Nabuchodonosor\nhad a dream, and his spirit was terrified, and his dream went out of\nhis mind.","Then the king commanded to call together the diviners and the wise\nmen, and the magicians, and the Chaldeans:  to declare to the king his\ndreams:  so they came and stood before the king.","And the king said to them:  I saw a dream:  and being troubled in\nmind I know not what I saw.","And the Chaldeans answered the king in Syriac:  O king, live for\never:  tell to thy servants thy dream, and we will declare the\ninterpretation thereof.","And the king, answering, said to the Chaldeans:  The thing is gone\nout of my mind:  unless you tell me the dream, and the meaning thereof,\nyou shall be put to death, and your houses shall be confiscated.","but if you tell the dream, and the meaning of it, you shall\nreceive of me rewards, and gifts, and great honour:  therefore, tell me\nthe dream, and the interpretation thereof.","They answered again and said:  Let the king tell his servants the\ndream, and we will declare the interpretation of it.","The king answered and said:  I know for certain, that you seek to\ngain time, since you know that the thing is gone from me.","If, therefore, you tell me not the dream, there is one sentence\nconcerning you, that you have also framed a lying interpretation, and\nfull of deceit, to speak before me till the time pass away.  Tell me,\ntherefore, the dream, that I may know that you also give a true\ninterpretation thereof.","Then the Chaldeans answered before the king, and said:  There is\nno man upon earth, that can accomplish thy word, O king; neither doth\nany king, though great and mighty, ask such a thing of any diviner, or\nwise man, or Chaldean.","For the thing that thou asketh, O king, is difficult:  nor can any\none be found that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose\nconversation is not with men.","Upon hearing this, the king in fury, and in great wrath,\ncommanded that all the wise men of Babylon should be put to death.","And the decree being gone forth, the wise men were slain:  and\nDaniel and his companions were sought for, to be put to death.","Then Daniel inquired concerning the law and the sentence, of\nArioch, the general of the king's army, who was gone forth to kill the\nwise men of Babylon.","And he asked him that had received the orders of the king, why so\ncruel a sentence was gone forth from the face of the king.  And when\nArioch had told the matter to Daniel,","Daniel went in, and desired of the king, that he would give him\ntime to resolve the question, and declare it to the king.","And he went into his house, and told the matter to Ananias, and\nMisael, and Azarias, his companions:","To the end that they should ask mercy at the face of the God of\nheaven, concerning this secret, and that Daniel and his companions\nmight not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.","Then was the mystery revealed to Daniel by a vision in the night:\nand Daniel blessed the God of heaven,","And speaking, he said:  Blessed be the name of the Lord from\neternity and for evermore:  for wisdom and fortitude are his.","And he changeth times and ages:  taketh away kingdoms, and\nestablisheth them:  giveth wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to them\nthat have understanding:","He revealeth deep and hidden things, and knoweth what is in\ndarkness:  and light is with him.","To thee, O God of our fathers, I give thanks, and I praise thee:\nbecause thou hast given me wisdom and strength:  and now thou hast shewn\nme what we desired of thee, for thou hast made known to us the king's\ndiscourse.","After this Daniel went in to Arioch, to whom the king had given\norders to destroy the wise men of Babylon, and he spoke thus to him:\nDestroy not the wise men of Babylon:  bring me in before the king, and I\nwill tell the solution to the king.","Then Arioch in haste brought in Daniel to the king, and said to\nhim:  I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Juda, that\nwill resolve the question to the king.","The king answered, and said to Daniel, whose name was Baltassar:\nThinkest thou indeed that thou canst tell me the dream that I saw, and\nthe interpretation thereof?","And Daniel made answer before the king, and said:  The secret that\nthe king desireth to know, none of the wise men, or the philosophers,\nor the diviners, or the soothsayers, can declare to the king.","But there is a God in heaven that revealeth mysteries, who hath\nshewn to thee, O king Nabuchodonosor, what is to come to pass in the\nlatter times.  Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are\nthese:","Thou, O king, didst begin to think in thy bed, what should come\nto pass hereafter:  and he that revealeth mysteries shewed thee what\nshall come to pass.","To me also this secret is revealed, not by any wisdom that I have\nmore than all men alive:  but that the interpretation might be made\nmanifest to the king, and thou mightest know the thought of thy mind.","Thou, O king, sawest, and behold there was as it were a great\nstatue:  this statue, which was great and high, tall of stature, stood\nbefore thee, and the look thereof was terrible.","The head of this statue was of fine gold, but the breast and the\narms of silver, and the belly and the thighs of brass.","And the legs of iron, the feet part of iron and part of clay.","Thus thou sawest, till a stone was cut out of a mountain without\nhands:  and it struck the statue upon the feet thereof that were of iron\nand clay, and broke them in pieces.","Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold\nbroken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of a summer's\nthreshing floor, and they were carried away by the wind:  and there was\nno place found for them:  but the stone that struck the statue became a\ngreat mountain, and filled the whole earth.","This is the dream:  we will also tell the interpretation thereof\nbefore thee, O king.","Thou art a king of kings:  and the God of heaven hath given thee a\nkingdom, and strength, and power, and glory:","And all places wherein the children of men, and the beasts of the\nfield do dwell:  he hath also given the birds of the air into thy hand,\nand hath put all things under thy power:  thou, therefore, art the head\nof gold.","And after thee shall rise up another kingdom, inferior to thee,\nof silver:  and another third kingdom of brass, which shall rule over\nall the world.","And the fourth kingdom shall be as iron.  As iron breaketh into\npieces, and subdueth all things, so shall that break, and destroy all\nthese.","And whereas thou sawest the feet, and the toes, part of potter's\nclay, and part of iron:  the kingdom shall be divided, but yet it shall\ntake its origin from the iron, according as thou sawest the iron mixed\nwith the miry clay.","And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay:\nthe kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.","And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall\nbe mingled indeed together with the seed of man, but they shall not\nstick fast one to another, as iron cannot be mixed with clay.","But in the days of those kingdoms, the God of heaven will set up\na kingdom that shall never by destroyed, and his kingdom shall not be\ndelivered up to another people:  and it shall break in pieces, and shall\nconsume all these kingdoms:  and itself shall stand for ever.","According as thou sawest, that the stone was cut out of the\nmountain without hands, and broke in pieces the clay and the iron, and\nthe brass, and the silver, and the gold, the great God hath shewn the\nking what shall come to pass hereafter, and the dream is true, and the\ninterpretation thereof is faithful.","Then king Nabuchodonosor fell on his face, and worshipped Daniel,\nand commanded that they should offer in sacrifice to him victims and\nincense.","And the king spoke to Daniel, and said:  Verily, your God is the\nGod of gods, and Lord of kings, and a revealer of hidden things:  seeing\nthou couldst discover this secret.","Then the king advanced Daniel to a high station, and gave him\nmany and great gifts:  and he made him governor over all the provinces\nof Babylon:  and chief of the magistrates over all the wise men of\nBabylon.","And Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Sidrach,\nMisach, and Abdenago, over the works of the province of Babylon:  but\nDaniel himself was in the king's palace."]}
