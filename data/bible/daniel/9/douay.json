{"verses":["In the first year of Darius, the son of Assuerus, of the seed of\nthe Medes, who reigned over the kingdom of the Chaldeans:","The first year of his reign I, Daniel, understood by books the\nnumber of the years, concerning which the word of the Lord came to\nJeremias, the prophet, that seventy years should be accomplished of the\ndesolation of Jerusalem.","And I set my face to the Lord, my God, to pray and make\nsupplication with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes.","And I prayed to the Lord, my God, and I made my confession, and\nsaid:  I beseech thee, O Lord God, great and terrible, who keepest the\ncovenant, and mercy to them that love thee, and keep thy commandments.","We have sinned, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly,\nand have revolted:  and we have gone aside from thy commandments, and\nthy judgments.","We have not hearkened to thy servants, the prophets, that have\nspoken in thy name to our kings, to our princes, to our fathers, and to\nall the people of the land.","To thee, O Lord, justice:  but to us confusion of face, as at this\nday to the men of Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all\nIsrael, to them that are near, and to them that are far off, in all the\ncountries whither thou hast driven them, for their iniquities, by which\nthey have sinned against thee.","O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our princes, and to\nour fathers, that have sinned.","But to thee, the Lord our God, mercy and forgiveness, for we have\ndeparted from thee:","And we have not hearkened to the voice of the Lord, our God, to\nwalk in his law, which he set before us by his servants, the prophets.","And all Israel have transgressed thy law, and have turned away\nfrom hearing thy voice, and the malediction, and the curse, which is\nwritten in the book of Moses, the servant of God, is fallen upon us,\nbecause we have sinned against him.","And he hath confirmed his words which he spoke against us, and\nagainst our princes that judged us, that he would bring in upon us a\ngreat evil, such as never was under all the heaven, according to that\nwhich hath been done in Jerusalem.","As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon\nus:  and we entreated not thy face, O Lord our God, that we might turn\nfrom our iniquities, and think on thy truth.","And the Lord hath watched upon the evil, and hath brought it upon\nus:  the Lord, our God, is just in all his works which he hath done:  for\nwe have not hearkened to his voice.","And now, O Lord, our God, who hast brought forth thy people out\nof the land of Egypt, with a strong hand, and hast made thee a name as\nat this day:  we have sinned, we have committed iniquity,","O Lord, against all thy justice:  let thy wrath and thy\nindignation be turned away, I beseech thee, from thy city, Jerusalem,\nand from thy holy mountain.  For by reason of our sins, and the\niniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem, and thy people, are a reproach to\nall that are round about us.","Now, therefore, O our God, hear the supplication of thy servant,\nand his prayers:  and shew thy face upon thy sanctuary, which is\ndesolate, for thy own sake.","Incline, O my God, thy ear, and hear:  open thy eyes, and see our\ndesolation, and the city upon which thy name is called:  for it is not\nfor our justifications that we present our prayers before thy face, but\nfor the multitude of thy tender mercies.","O Lord, hear:  O Lord, be appeased:  hearken, and do:  delay not,\nfor thy own sake, O my God:  because thy name is invocated upon thy\ncity, and upon thy people.","Now while I was yet speaking, and praying, and confessing my\nsins, and the sins of my people of Israel, and presenting my\nsupplications in the sight of my God, for the holy mountain of my God:","As I was yet speaking in prayer, behold the man, Gabriel, whom I\nhad seen in the vision at the beginning, flying swiftly, touched me at\nthe time of the evening sacrifice.","And he instructed me, and spoke to me, and said:  O Daniel, I am\nnow come forth to teach thee, and that thou mightest understand.","From the beginning of thy prayers the word came forth:  and I am\ncome to shew it to thee, because thou art a man of desires:  therefore,\ndo thou mark the word, and understand the vision.","Seventy weeks are shortened upon thy people, and upon thy holy\ncity, that transgression may be finished, and sin may have an end, and\niniquity may be abolished; and everlasting justice may be brought; and\nvision and prophecy may be fulfilled; and the Saint of saints may be\nanointed.","Know thou, therefore, and take notice:  that from the going forth\nof the word, to build up Jerusalem again, unto Christ, the prince,\nthere shall be seven weeks, and sixty-two weeks:  and the street shall\nbe built again, and the walls, in straitness of times.","And after sixty-two weeks Christ shall be slain:  and the people\nthat shall deny him shall not be his.  And a people, with their leader,\nthat shall come, shall destroy the city, and the sanctuary:  and the end\nthereof shall be waste, and after the end of the war the appointed\ndesolation.","And he shall confirm the covenant with many, in one week:  and in\nthe half of the week the victim and the sacrifice shall fail:  and there\nshall be in the temple the abomination of desolation:  and the\ndesolation shall continue even to the consummation, and to the end."]}
