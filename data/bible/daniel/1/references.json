Some persons who aspire to the life of chastity fall midway in their journey from supposing that they need only abstain from flesh. They load their stomachs with vegetables which are only harmless when taken sparingly and in moderation. If I am to say what I think, there is nothing which so much heats the body and inflames the passions as undigested food and breathing broken with hiccoughs. As for you, my daughter, I would rather wound your modesty than endanger my case by understatement. Regard everything as poison which bears within it the seeds of sensual pleasure. A meagre diet which leaves the appetite always unsatisfied is to be preferred to fasts three days long.

As to the seasons of the year, dreams are calmer in spring, since summer relaxes, and winter somehow hardens, the soul; while autumn, which in other respects is trying to health, is apt to enervate the soul by the lusciousness of its fruits. Then, again, as regards the position of one's body during sleep, one ought not to lie on his back, nor on his right side, nor so as to wrench[fn-29-P2999_1074075:287-nf] his intestines, as if their cavity were reversely stretched: a palpitation of the heart would ensue, or else a pressure on the liver would produce a painful disturbance of the mind. But however this be, I take it that it all amounts to ingenious conjecture rather than certain proof (although the author of the conjecture be no less a man than Plato);[fn-30-P3000_1074450:288-nf] and possibly all may be no other than the result of chance. But, generally speaking, dreams will be under control of a man's will, if they be capable of direction at all; for we must not examine what opinion on the one hand, and superstition on the other, have to prescribe for the treatment of dreams, in the matter of distinguishing and modifying different sorts of food. As for the superstition, we have an instance when fasting is prescribed for such persons as mean to submit to the sleep which is necessary for receiving the oracle, in order that such abstinence may produce the required purity; while we find an instance of the opinion when the disciples of Pythagoras, in order to attain the same end, reject the bean as an aliment which would load the stomach, and produce indigestion. But the three brethren, who were the companions of Daniel, being content with pulse alone, to escape the contamination of the royal dishes,[fn-30-P3001_1075426:289-nf] received from God, besides other wisdom, the gift especially of penetrating and explaining the sense of dreams. For my own part, I hardly know whether fasting would not simply make me dream so profoundly, that I should not be aware whether I had in fact dreamt at all. Well, then, you ask, has not sobriety something to do in this matter? certainly it is as much concerned in this as it is in the entire subject: if it contributes some good service to superstition, much more does it to religion. For even demons require such discipline from their dreamers as a gratification to their divinity, because they know that it is acceptable to God, since Daniel (to quote him again) \"ate no pleasant bread\" for the space of three weeks.[fn-30-P3002_1076178:290-nf] This abstinence, however, he used in order to please God by humiliation, and not for the purpose of producing a sensibility and wisdom for his soul previous to receiving communication by dreams and visions, as if it were not rather to effect such action in an ecstatic state. This sobriety, then, (in which our question arises, ) will have nothing to do with exciting ecstasy, but will rather serve to recommend its being wrought by God.","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_17_book_x","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"49","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"46.

The consciousness of faith takes away the weakness of nature, transforms the bodily senses that they feel no pain, and so the body is strengthened by the fixed purpose of the soul, and feels nothing except the impulse of its enthusiasm. The suffering which the mind despises in its desire of glory, the body does not feel, so long as the soul invigorates it. It is, then, a natural effect in man, that the zeal of the soul glowing for glory should make him unconscious of suffering, heedless of wounds, and regardless of death.

For it would follow that Moses and the prophets were not only influenced by devils in making so much in their laws of the distinctions in food, but also that they themselves were impure and defiled in their mind and conscience, so that the following words also might properly be applied to them: \"They profess to know God, but in works deny Him.\"[fn-24-P2453_1485531:1-nf] This is applicable to no one more than to Moses and the prophets, who are known to have lived very differently from what was becoming in men knowing God.

How, then, can you persist in thinking that the vision of the divine majesty can have been bestowed on such men, when it is written that only the pure in heart can see God? Even supposing that they had been pure from unlawful crimes, this superstitious abstinence from certain kinds of food, if it defiles the mind, is enough to debar them from the sight of deity. Gone for ever, too, is the boast of Daniel, and of the three youths, who, till now that we are told that nothing is unclean, have been regarded among the Jews as persons of great purity and excellence of character, because, in observance of hereditary customs, they carefully avoided defiling themselves with Gentile food, especially that of sacrifices.[fn-24-P2454_1486670:2-nf] Now it appears that they were defiled in mind and conscience most of all when they were closing their mouth against blood and idol-feasts.","title":"Book XXXI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_45_oration_xxx_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"III.

Quod si usurpent vocem Domini, qui dicit Philippo: \"Sine mortuos sepelire mortuos suos, tu autem sequere me: \"[fn-62-P6240_1900416:17-nf] at illud considerent, quod similem cam is formationem fert quoque Philippus, non habens cadaver pollutum. Quomodo ergo cum carhem haberet, non habuit cadaver? Quoniam surrexit ex monumento, Domino ejus vitia morte afficiente, vixit autem Christo. Meminimus autem nefariae quoque ex Carpocratis sententia mulierum communionis. Cum autem de dicto Nicolai loqueremur, illud prae termisimus: Cum formosam, aiunt, haberet uxorem, et post Servatoris assumptionem ei fuisset ab apostolis exprobrata zelotypia, in medium adducta muliere, permisit cui vellet eam nubere. Aiunt enim hanc actionem illi voci consentaneam, quae dicit, quod \"carne abuti oporteat.\" Proinde ejus factum et dictum absolute et inconsiderate sequentes, qui ejus haeresim persequuntur, impudenter effuseque fornicantur. Ego autem audio Nicolaum quidem nulla unquam alia, quam ea, quae ei nupserat, uxore usum esse; et ex illius liberis, filias quidem consenuisse virgines, filium autem permansisse incorruptum. Quae cum ita se habeant, vitii erat depulsio atque expurgatio, in medium apostolorum circumactio uxoris, cujus dicebatur laborare zelotypia: et continentia a voluptatibus, quae magno studio parari solent, docebat illud, \"abuti carne,\" hoc est, exercere carnem. Neque enim, ut existimo, volebant, convenienter Domini praecepto, \"duobus dominis servire,\"[fn-62-P6241_1901779:18-nf] voluptati et Deo. Dicunt itaque Matthiam[fn-62-P6242_1901853:19-nf] quoque sic docuisse: \"Cum carne quidem pugnare, et ea uti, nihil ei impudicum largiendo ad voluptatem; augere autem animam per fidem et cognitionem.\" Sunt autem, qui etiam publicam venerem pronuntiant mysticam communionem; et sic ipsum nomen contumelia afficiunt. Sicut enim operari eum dicimus, tum qui malum aliquod facit, tum etiam qui bonum, idem nomen utrique tribuentes; haud aliter \"communio\" usurpari solet; nam bona quidem est in communicatione tum peeuniae, tum nutrimenti et yestitus: illi autem quamlibet veneream conjunctionem impie vocaverunt \"communionem.\" Dicunt itaque ex iis quemdam, cum ad hostram virginem vultu formosam accessisset, dixisse: Scriptum est: \"Da omni te petenti: \"[fn-62-P6243_1902576:20-nf] illam autem honeste admodum respondisse, ut quse non intelligeret hominis petulantiam: At tu matrem conveni de matrimonio. O impietatem! etiam voces Domini ementiuntur isti intemperantiae communicatores, fratresque libidinis, non solum probrum philosophiae, sed etiam totius vitae; qui veritatem, quantum in eis situm est, adulterant ac corrumpunt, vel potius defodiunt; homines infelicissimi carnalem concubitus communionem consecrant, et hanc ipsos putant ad regnum Dei perducere. Ad lupanaria ergo deducit haec communio, et cure eis communicaverint sues et hirci, maximaque apud illos in spe fuerint meretrices, quae in prostibulis praesto sunt, et volentes omnes admittunt. \"Vos autem non sic Christum didicistis, siquidem ipsum audiistis, et in eo docti estis, quemadmodum est veritas in Christo Jesu, ut deponatis quae sunt secundum veterem conversationem, veterem hominem, qui corrumpitur secundum desideria deceptionis.

Atque adeo afferam dictionem, quae mater eorum intemperantiae et origo est: et sive ipsi hujus libri scriptores se fateantur, en eorum recordiam, licet Deo eum falso ascribant libidinis intemperantia ducti: sive ab aliis, eos perverse audientes, hoc praeclarum dogma acceperint, sic porto se habent ejus verba: \"Unum erant omnia: postquam autem ejus unitati visum est non esse solam, exiit ab eo inspiratio, et cum ea iniit communionem, et fecit dilectum. Exhinc autem egressa est ab ipso inspiratio, cum qua cure communionem iniisset, fecit porestates, quae nec possunt videri nec audiri,\" usque ad illud, \"unamquamque in nomine proprio.\" Si enim hi quoque, sicut Valentiniani, spiritales posuissent communiones, suscepisset forte aliquis eorum opinionem: carnalis autem libidinis communionem ad sanctam inducere prophetiam, est ejus qui desperat salutem. Talia etiam statuunt Prodici quoque asseclae, qui seipsos falso nomine vocant Gnosticos: seipsos quidem dicentes esse natura filios primi Dei; ea vero nobilitate et libertate abutentes, vivunt ut volunt; volunt autem libidinose; se nulla re teneri arbitrati, ut \"domini sabbati,\" et qui sint quovis genere superiores, filii regales. Regi autem, inquiunt, lex scripta non est. Primum quidem, quod non faciant omnia quae volunt: multa enim cos prohibebunt, etsi cupiant et conentur. Quinetiam quae faciunt, non faciunt ut reges, sed ut mastigiae: clanculum enim commitrunt adulteria, timerites ne deprehendantur, et vitantes ne condemntur, et metuentes ne supplicio afficiantur. Quomodo etiam res est libera, intemperantia et turpis sermo? \"Omnis enim, qui peccat, est servus,\" inquit Apostolus.[fn-62-P6247_1905945:24-nf] Sed quomodo vitiam ex Deo instituit, qui seipsum prae buit dedititium cuivis concupiscentiae? cum dixerit Dominus: \"Ego autem dico: Ne concupiscas.\" Vultne autem aliquis sua sponte peccare, et decernere adulteria esse committenda, voluptatibusque et deliciis se explendum, et aliorum violanda matrimonia, cum aliorum etiam, qui inviti peccant, misereamur? Quod si in externum mundum venerint, qui in alieno non fuerint fideles, verum non babebunt. Afficit autem hospes aliquis elves contumelia, et eis injuriam facit; et non potius ut peregrinus, utens necessariis, vivit, cives non offendens? Quomodo autem, cum eadem faciant, ac ii, quos gentes odio habent, quod legibus obtemperare nolint, nempe iniqui, et incontinentes, et avari, et adulteri, dicunt se solos Deum nosse? Oporteret enim eos, cum in alienis adsunt, recte vivere, ut revera regiam indolem ostenderent. Jam vero et humanos legislatores, et divinam legera habent sibi infensam, cum inique et praeter leges vivere instituerint. Is certe, qui scortatorein \"confodit,\" a Deo plus esse ostenditur in Numeris. \"Et si dixerimus,\" inquit Joannes in epistola, \"quod societatem habemus cum eo,\" nempe Deo, \"et in tenebris ambulamus, mentitour, et veritatem non facimus. Si autem in luce ambulamus, sicut et ipse est in luce, societatem habemus cum ipso, et sanguis Jesu filii ejus emundat nos a peccato.\"[fn-62-P6248_1907326:25-nf] Quomodo ergo sunt hi hujus mundi hominibus meliores, qui haec faciunt, et vel pessimis hujus mundi sunt similes? sunt enim, ut arbitror, similes natura, qui sunt factis similes. Quibus autem se esse censent nobilitate superiores, eos debent etiam superare moribus, ut vitent ne includantur in carcere. Revera enim, ut dixit Dominus: \"Nisi abundavetit justitia vestra plus quam scribarum et Pharisaeorum, non intrabitis in regnum Dei.\"[fn-62-P6249_1907795:26-nf] De abstinentia autem a cibis ostenditur a Daniele.[fn-62-P6250_1907864:27-nf] Ut semel autem dicam, de obedientia dicit psallens David: \"In quo diriget junior viam suam? \"[fn-62-P6251_1907974:28-nf] Et statim audit: \"In custodiendo sermones tuos in toto corde.\" Et dicit Jeremias: \"Haec autem dicit Dominus: Per vias gentium ne ambulaveritis.\"[fn-62-P6252_1908139:29-nf] Hinc moti aliqui alii, pusilli et nullius pretii, dicunt formatum fuisse hominem a diversis potestatibus: et quae sunt quidem usque ad umbilicum esse artis divinioris; quae autem subter, minoris; qua de causa coitum quoque appetere.

They were selected by Divine Providence to receive the Divine Spirit, and to be the depositaries of His holy oracles, on the ground of their leading a life of almost unapproachable excellence, intrepid, noble, unmoved by danger or death. For reason teaches that such ought to be the character of the prophets of the Most High, in comparison with which the firmness of Antisthenes, Crates, and Diogenes will seem but as child's play. It was therefore for their firm adherence to truth, and their faithfulness in the reproof of the wicked, that \"they were stoned; they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword; they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; they wandered in deserts and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth, of whom the world was not worthy: \"[fn-108-P10871_2911049:6-nf] for they looked always to God and to His blessings, which, being invisible, and not to be perceived by the senses, are eternal.

We therefore for this reason set at nought the oracles of the Pythian priestess, or those delivered at Dodona, at Clarus, at Branchidae, at the temple of Jupiter Ammon, or by a multitude of other so-called prophets; whilst we regard with reverent awe the Jewish prophets: for we see that the noble, earnest, and devout lives of these men were worthy of the inspiration of the Divine Spirit, whose wonderful effects were widely different from the divination of demons.","title":"Book VII.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_15_xi_the_testament_of_joseph_concerning_sobriety_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"ANF-08","text":"3.
