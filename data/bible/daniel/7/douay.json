{"verses":["In the first year of Baltasar, king of Babylon, Daniel saw a\ndream:  and the vision of his head was upon his bed:  and writing the\ndream, he comprehended it in a few words:  and relating the sum of it in\nshort, he said:","I saw in my vision by night, and behold the four winds of the\nheavens strove upon the great sea.","And four great beasts, different one from another, came up out of\nthe sea.","The first was like a lioness, and had the wings of an eagle:  I\nbeheld till her wings were plucked off, and she was lifted up from the\nearth, and stood upon her feet as a man, and the heart of a man was\ngiven to her.","And behold another beast, like a bear, stood up on one side:  and\nthere were three rows in the mouth thereof, and in the teeth thereof,\nand thus they said to it:  Arise, devour much flesh.","After this I beheld, and lo, another like a leopard, and it had\nupon it four wings, as of a fowl, and the beast had four heads, and\npower was given to it.","After this I beheld in the vision of the night, and lo, a fourth\nbeast, terrible and wonderful, and exceeding strong, it had great iron\nteeth, eating and breaking in pieces, and treading down the rest with\nhis feet:  and it was unlike to the other beasts which I had seen before\nit, and had ten horns.","I considered the horns, and behold another little horn sprung out\nof the midst of them:  and three of the first horns were plucked up at\nthe presence thereof:  and behold eyes like the eyes of a man were in\nthis horn, and a mouth speaking great things.","I beheld till thrones were placed, and the ancient of days sat:\nhis garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like clean\nwool:  his throne like flames of fire:  the wheels of it like a burning\nfire.","A swift stream of fire issued forth from before him:  thousands of\nthousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times a hundred thousand\nstood before him:  the judgment sat, and the books were opened.","I beheld, because of the voice of the great words which that horn\nspoke:  and I saw that the beast was slain, and the body thereof was\ndestroyed, and given to the fire to be burnt:","And that the power of the other beasts was taken away:  and that\ntimes of life were appointed them for a time, and a time.","I beheld, therefore, in the vision of the night, and lo, one like\nthe Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and he came even to the\nancient of days:  and they presented him before him.","And he gave him power, and glory, and a kingdom:  and all peoples,\ntribes, and tongues shall serve him:  his power is an everlasting power\nthat shall not be taken away:  and his kingdom that shall not be\ndestroyed.","My spirit trembled; I, Daniel, was affrighted at these things,\nand the visions of my head troubled me.","I went near to one of them that stood by, and asked the truth of\nhim concerning all these things, and he told me the interpretation of\nthe words, and instructed me:","These four great beasts, are four kingdoms, which shall arise out\nof the earth.","But the saints of the most high God shall take the kingdom:  and\nthey shall possess the kingdom for ever and ever.","After this I would diligently learn concerning the fourth beast,\nwhich was very different from all, and exceeding terrible:  his teeth\nand claws were of iron:  he devoured and broke in pieces, and the rest\nhe stamped upon with his feet:","And concerning the ten horns that he had on his head:  and\nconcerning the other that came up, before which three horns fell:  and\nof that horn that had eyes, and a mouth speaking great things, and was\ngreater than the rest.","I beheld, and lo, that horn made war against the saints, and\nprevailed over them,","Till the ancient of days came and gave judgment to the saints of\nthe most High, and the time came, and the saints obtained the kingdom.","And thus he said:  The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom\nupon earth, which shall be greater than all the kingdoms, and shall\ndevour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in\npieces.","And the ten horns of the same kingdom, shall be ten kings:  and\nanother shall rise up after them, and he shall be mightier than the\nformer, and he shall bring down three kings.","And he shall speak words against the High One, and shall crush\nthe saints of the most High:  and he shall think himself able to change\ntimes and laws, and they shall be delivered into his hand until a time,\nand times, and half a time.","And a judgment shall sit, that his power may be taken away, and\nbe broken in pieces, and perish even to the end.","And that the kingdom, and power, and the greatness of the\nkingdom, under the whole heaven, may be given to the people of the\nsaints of the most High:  whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and\nall kings shall serve him, and shall obey him.","Hitherto is the end of the word.  I, Daniel, was much troubled\nwith my thoughts, and my countenance was changed in me:  but I kept the\nword in my heart."]}
