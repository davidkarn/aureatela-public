But if it is known to all that certain animals are accustomed to conceive[fn-12-P1279_553932:107-nf] by the wind and the breeze, why should any one think it wonderful when we say that a virgin was made fruitful by the Spirit of God, to whom whatever He may wish is easy? And this might have appeared incredible, had not the prophets many ages previously foretold its occurrence. Thus Solomon speaks:[fn-12-P1280_554415:108-nf] \"The womb of a virgin was strengthened, and conceived; and a virgin was made fruitful, and became a mother in great pity.\" Likewise the prophet Isaiah,[fn-12-P1281_554760:109-nf] whose words are these: \"Therefore God Himself shall give you a sign: Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son; and ye shall call His name Emmanuel.\" What can be more manifest than this? This was read by the Jews, who denied Him. If any one thinks that these things are invented by us, let him inquire of them, let him take especially from them: the testimony is sufficiently strong to prove the truth, when it is alleged by enemies themselves, But He was never called Emmanuel, but Jesus, who in Latin is called Saving, or Saviour,[fn-12-P1282_555320:110-nf] because He comes bringing salvation to all nations. But by this name the prophet declared that God incarnate was about to come to men. For Emmanuel signifies God with us; because when He was born of a virgin, men ought to confess that God was with them, that is, on the earth and in mortal flesh. Whence David[fn-12-P1283_555663:111-nf] says in the eighty-fourth Psalm, \"Truth has sprung out of the earth; \"because God, in whom is truth, hath taken a body of earth, that He might open a way of salvation to those of the earth. In like manner Isaiah also:[fn-12-P1284_555932:112-nf] \"But they disbelieved, and vexed His Holy Spirit; and He was turned to be their enemy. And He Himself fought against them, and He remembered the days of old,[fn-12-P1285_556114:113-nf] who raised up from the earth a shepherd of the sheep.\" But who this shepherd was about to be, he declared in another place,[fn-12-P1286_556419:114-nf] saying: \"Let the heavens rejoice, and let the clouds put on righteousness; let the earth open, and put forth a Saviour. For I the Lord have begotten Him.\" But the Saviour is, as we have said before, Jesus. But in another place the same prophet also thus proclaimed:[fn-12-P1287_556733:115-nf] \"Behold, unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given, whose dominion is upon His shoulders, and His name is called Messenger of great counsel.\" For on this account He was sent by God the Father, that He might reveal to all the nations which are under heaven the sacred mystery of the only true God, which was taken away from the perfidious people, who ofttimes sinned against God. Daniel also foretold similar things:[fn-12-P1288_557195:116-nf] \"I saw,\" he said, \"in a vision of the night, and, behold, one like the Son of man coming with the clouds of heaven, and He came even to the Ancient of days. And they who stood by brought Him near[fn-12-P1289_557416:117-nf] before Him. And there was given unto Him a kingdom, and glory, and dominion; and all people, tribes, and languages shall serve Him: and His dominion is everlasting, which shall never pass away, and His kingdom shall not be destroyed.\" How then do the Jews both confess and expect the Christ of God? who rejected Him on this account, because He was born of man. For since it is so arranged by God that the same Christ should twice come to the earth, once to announce to the nations the one God, then again to reign, why do they who did not believe in His first advent believe in the second?","title":"Book IV.

But He also opened to them all things which were about to happen, which Peter and Paul preached at Rome; and this preaching being written for the sake of remembrance,[fn-15-P1557_630721:308-nf] became permanent, in which they both declared other wonderful things, and also said that it was about to come to pass, that after a short time God would send against them a king who would subdue[fn-15-P1558_631009:309-nf] the Jews, and level their cities to the ground, and besiege the people themselves, worn out with hunger and thirst. Then it should come to pass that they should feed on the bodies of their own children, and consume one another.

Or if he shall wish to follow the justice of God, yet, being ignorant of the divine law, he embraces the laws of his own country as true justice, though they were clearly devised not by justice, but by utility. For why is it that there are different and various laws amongst all people, but that each nation has enacted for itself that which it deemed useful for its own affairs? But how greatly utility differs from justice the Roman people themselves teach, who, by proclaiming war through the Fecials, and by inflicting injuries according to legal forms, by always desiring and carrying off the property of other, have gained for themselves the possession of the whole world.[fn-21-P2194_887838:65-nf] But these persons think themselves just if they do nothing against their own laws; which may be even ascribed to fear, if they abstain from crimes through dread of present punishment.

Will they therefore be just, because they obey the institutions of men, who may themselves have erred, or have been unjust?-as it was with the framers of the twelve tables, who certainly promoted the public advantage according to the condition of the times.

He therefore, as an Aeons so great, and (as) offspring of the entire Pleroma, caused the passions to depart from her, and he made these substantially-existent essences.[fn-15-P1576_469592:73-nf] He altered fear into animal desire,[fn-15-P1577_469707:74-nf] and (made) grief material, and (rendered) perplexity (the passion) of demons.

There is, however, he says, a twofold power of the fire; for fire is all-consuming, (and) cannot he quenched.

Moreover, from the things created at the beginning may be learnt the fellowship of the Spirit with the Father and the Son. The pure, intelligent, and supermundane powers are and are styled holy, because they have their holiness of the grace given by the Holy Spirit. Accordingly the mode of the creation of the heavenly powers is passed over in Silence, for the historian of the cosmogony has revealed to us only the creation of things perceptible by sense. But do thou, who hast power from the things that are seen to form an analogy of the unseen, glorify the Maker by whom all things were made, visible and invisible, principalities and powers, authorities, thrones, and dominions, and all other reasonable natures whom we cannot name.[fn-15-P1559_383788:327-nf] And in the creation bethink thee first, I pray thee, of the original cause of all things that are made, the Father; of the creative cause, the Son; of the perfecting cause, the Spirit; so that the ministering spirits subsist by the will of the Father, are brought into being by the operation of the Son, and perfected by the presence of the Spirit. Moreover, the perfection of angels is sanctification and continuance in it. And let no one imagine me either to affirm that there are three original hypostases[fn-15-P1560_384325:328-nf] or to allege the operation of the Son to be imperfect. For the first principle of existing things is One, creating through the Son and perfecting through the Spirit.[fn-15-P1561_384514:329-nf] The operation of the Father who worketh all in all is not imperfect, neither is the creating work of the Son incomplete if not perfected by the Spirit. The Father, who creates by His sole will, could not stand in any need of the Son, but nevertheless He wills through the Son; nor could the Son, who works according to the likeness of the Father, need co-operation, but the Son too wills to make perfect through the Spirit. \"For by the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath [the Spirit] of His mouth.\"[fn-15-P1562_385080:330-nf] The Word then is not a mere significant impression on the air, borne by the organs of speech; nor is the Spirit of His mouth a vapour, emitted by the organs of respiration; but the Word is He who \"was with God in the beginning\" and \"was God,\"[fn-15-P1563_385462:331-nf] and the Spirit of the mouth of God is \"the Spirit of truth which proceedeth from the Father.\"[fn-15-P1564_385668:332-nf] You are therefore to perceive three, the Lord who gives the order, the Word who creates,and the Spirit who confirms.[fn-15-P1565_385807:333-nf] And what other thing could confirmation be than the perfecting according to holiness? This perfectingexpresses the confirmation's firmness,unchangeableness,and fixity in good. But there is no sanctification without the Spirit. The powers of the heavens are not holy by nature; were it so there would in this respect be no difference between them and the Holy Spirit. It is in proportion to their relative excellence that they have their meed of holiness from the Spirit. The branding-iron is conceived of together with the fire; and yet the material and the fire are distinct. Thus too in the case of the heavenly powers; their substance is, peradventure, an aerial spirit, or an immaterial fire, as it is written, \"Who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire;\"[fn-15-P1566_386607:334-nf] wherefore they exist in space and become visible, and appear in their proper bodily form to them that are worthy. But their sanctification, being external to their substance, superinduces their perfection through the communion of the Spirit. They keep their rank by their abiding in the good and true, and while they retain their freedom of will, never fall away from their patient attendance on Him who is truly good. It results that, if by your argument you do away with the Spirit, the hosts of the angels are disbanded, the dominions of archangels are destroyed, all is thrown into confusion, and their life loses law, order, and distinctness. For how are angels to cry \"Glory to God in the highest\"[fn-15-P1567_387331:335-nf] without being empowered by the Spirit? For \"No man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost, and no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed;\"[fn-15-P1568_387931:336-nf] as might be said by wicked and hostile spirits, whose fall establishes our statement of the freedom of the will of the invisible powers; being, as they are, in a condition of equipoise between virtue and vice, and on this account needing the succour of the Spirit. I indeed maintain that even Gabriel[fn-15-P1569_388251:337-nf] in no other way foretells events to come than by the foreknowledge of the Spirit, by reason of the fact that one of the boons distributed by the Spirit is prophecy. And whence did he who was ordained to announce the mysteries of the vision to the Man of Desires[fn-15-P1570_388533:338-nf] derive the wisdom whereby he was enabled to teach hidden things, if not from the Holy Spirit? The revelation of mysteries is indeed the peculiar function of the Spirit, as it is written, \"God hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit.\"[fn-15-P1571_388790:339-nf] And how could \"thrones, dominions, principalities and powers\"[fn-15-P1572_388871:340-nf] live their blessed life, did they not \"behold the face of the Father which is in heaven\"?[fn-15-P1573_389017:341-nf] But to behold it is impossible without the Spirit! Just as at night, if you withdraw the light from the house, the eyes fall blind and their faculties become inactive, and the worth of objects cannot be discerned, and gold is trodden on in ignorance as though it were iron, so in the order of the intellectual world it is impossible for the high life of Law to abide without the Spirit. For it so to abide were as likely as that an army should maintain its discipline in the absence of its commander, or a chorus its harmony without the guidance of the coryphaeus. How could the Seraphim cry\"Holy, Holy, Holy,\"[fn-15-P1574_389650:342-nf] were they not taught by the Spirit how often true religion requires them to lift their voice in this ascription of glory? Do \"all His angels\" and \"all His hosts\"[fn-15-P1575_389831:343-nf] praise God? It is through the co-operation of the Spirit. Do \"thousand thousand\" of angels stand before Him, and\"ten thousand times ten thouSand\" ministering spirits?[fn-15-P1576_390022:344-nf] They are blamelessly doing their proper work by the power of the Spirit. All the glorious and unspeakable harmony[fn-15-P1577_390154:345-nf] of the highest heavens both in the service of God, and in the mutual concord of the celestial powers, can therefore only be preserved by the direction of the Spirit.

A pair, on the one hand, and consimilar (they were), because of the identity of the Lord's general appearance, inasmuch as He is not to come in some other form, seeing that He has to be recognised by those by whom He was once hurt. But the one of them, begirt with scarlet, amid cursing and universal spitting, and tearing, and piercing, was cast away by the People outside the city into perdition, marked with manifest tokens of Christ's passion; who, after being begirt with scarlet garment, and subjected to universal spitting, and afflicted with all contumelies, was crucified outside the city.[fn-24-P2498_812247:343-nf] The other, however: offered for sins, and given as food to the priests merely of the temple,[fn-24-P2499_812479:344-nf] gave signal evidences of the second appearance; in so far as, after the expiation of all sins, the priests of the spiritual temple, that is, of the church, were to enjoy[fn-25-P2500_812702:345-nf] a spiritual public distribution (as it were) of the Lord's grace, while all others are fasting from salvation.","title":"An Answer to the Jews.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":7,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_20_on_the_proceedings_of_pelagius_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"103","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"After the judges had accorded their approbation to this answer of Pelagius, another passage which he had written in his book was read aloud: \"The kingdom of heaven was promised even in the Old Testament.\" Upon this, Pelagius remarked in vindication: \"This can be proved by the Scriptures: but heretics, in order to disparage the Old Testament, deny this.

Certainly not. The fact is, that the phrase Old Testament is constantly employed in two different ways,-in one, following the authority of the Holy Scriptures; in the other, following the most common custom of speech. For the Apostle Paul says, in his Epistle to the Galatians: \"Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? For it is written that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bond-maid, the other by a free woman. . . . Which things are an allegory: for these are the two testaments; the one which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar. For this is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and is conjoined with the Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children; whereas the Jerusalem which is above is free, and is the mother of us all.\"[fn-28-P2879_1112705:36-nf] Now, inasmuch as the Old Testament belongs to bondage, whence it is written, \"Cast out the bond-woman and her son, for the son of the bond-woman shall not be heir with my son Isaac,\"[fn-28-P2880_1112909:37-nf] but the kingdom of heaven to liberty; what has the kingdom of heaven to do with the Old Testament? Since, however, as I have already remarked, we are accustomed, in our ordinary use of words, to designate all those Scriptures of the law and the prophets which were given previous to the Lord's incarnation, and are embraced together by canonical authority, under the name and title of the Old Testament, what man who is ever so moderately informed in ecclesiastical lore can be ignorant that the kingdom of heaven could be quite as well promised in those early Scriptures as even the New Testament itself, to which the kingdom of heaven belongs? At all events, in those ancient Scriptures it is most distinctly written: \"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will consummate a new testament with the house of Israel and with the house of Jacob; not according to the testament that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand, to lead them out of the land of Egypt.\"[fn-28-P2881_1113925:38-nf] This was done on Mount Sinai. But then there had not yet risen the prophet Daniel to say: \"The saints shall receive the kingdom of the Most High.\"[fn-28-P2882_1114096:39-nf] For by these words he foretold the merit not of the Old, but of the New Testament. In the same manner did the same prophets foretell that Christ Himself would come, in whose blood the New Testament was consecrated. Of this Testament also the apostles became the ministers, as the most blessed Paul declares: \"He hath made us able ministers of the New Testament; not in its letter, but in spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.\"[fn-28-P2883_1114564:40-nf] In that testament, however, which is properly calledthe Old, and was given on Mount Sinai, only earthly happiness is expressly promised. Accordingly that land, into which the nation, after being led through the wilderness, was conducted, is called the land of promise, wherein peace and royal power, and the gaining of victories over enemies, and an abundance of children and of fruits of the ground, and gifts of a similar kind are the promises of the Old Testament. And these, indeed, are figures of the spiritual blessings which appertain to the New Testament; but yet the man who lives under God's law with those earthly blessings for his sanction, is precisely the heir of the Old Testament, for just such rewards are promised and given to him, according to the terms of the Old Testament, as are the objects of his desire according to the condition of the old man. But whatever blessings are there figuratively set forth as appertaining to the New Testament require the new man to give them effect. And no doubt the great apostle understood perfectly well what he was saying, when he described the two testaments as capable of the allegorical distinction of thebond-woman and the free,-attributing the children of the flesh to the Old, and to the New the children of the promise: \"They,\" says he, \"which are the children of the flesh, are not the children of God; but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.\"[fn-28-P2884_1116013:41-nf] The children of the flesh, then, belong to the earthly Jerusalem, which is in bondage with her children; whereas the children of the promise belong to the Jerusalemabove, the free, the mother of us all, eternal inthe heavens.[fn-28-P2885_1116256:42-nf] Whence we can easily see who they are thai appertain to the earthly, and who to the heavenly kingdom.But then the happy persons, who even in that early age were by the grace of God taught to understand the distinction now set forth, were thereby made the children of promise, and were accounted in the secret purpose of God as heirs of the New Testament; although they continued with perfect fitness to administer the Old Testament to the ancient people of God, because it was divinely appropriated to that people in God's distribution of the times and seasons.","title":"On the Proceedings of Pelagius,","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":7,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_20_on_the_proceedings_of_pelagius_","source_chapter":65,"source_paragraph":"204","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"After this heresy had deceived a great many persons, and was disturbing the brethren whom it had failed to deceive, one Coelestius, who entertained these sentiments, was brought up for trial before the Church of Carthage, and was condemned by a sentence of the bishops.[fn-31-P3148_1226552:157-nf] Then, a few years afterwards, Pelagius, who was said to have been this man's instructor, having been accused of holding his heresy, found also his way before an episcopal tribunal.[fn-31-P3149_1226973:158-nf] The indictment was prepared against him by the Gallican bishops, Heros and Lazarus, who were, however, not present at the proceedings, and were excused from attendance owing to the illness of one of them. After all the charges were duly recited, and Pelagius had met them by his answers, the fourteen bishops of the province of Palestine pronounced him, in accordance with his answers, free from the perversity of this heresy; while yet without hesitation condemning the heresy itself. They approved indeed of his answer to the objections, that \"a man is assisted by a knowledge of the law, towards not sinning; even as it is written, `He hath given them a law for a help;'\"[fn-31-P3150_1227726:159-nf] but yet they disapproved of this knowledge of the law being that grace of God concerning which the Scripture says: \"Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?

Man, however, when sinning, is himself in fault, as being under the direction of his free will.\"[fn-31-P3152_1228356:161-nf] They approved, moreover, of his statement, that\"in the day of judgment no forbearance will be shown to the ungodly and sinners, but they will be punished in everlasting fires;\" because in his defence he said, \"that he had made such an assertion in accordance with the gospel, in which it is written concerning sinners, `These shall go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into life eternal.'\"[fn-31-P3153_1228781:162-nf] But he did not say, all sinners are reserved for eternal punishment, for then he would evidently have run counter to the apostle, who distinctly states that some of them will be saved, \"yet so as by fire.\"[fn-31-P3154_1229023:163-nf] When also Pelagius said that \"the kingdom of heaven was promised even in the Old Testament,\" they approved of the statement, on the ground that he supported himself by the testimony of the prophet Daniel, who thus wrote: \"The saints shall take the kingdom of the Most High.\"[fn-31-P3155_1229321:164-nf] They understood him, in this statement of his, to mean by the term \"Old Testament,\" not simply the Testament which was made on Mount Sinai, but the entire body of the canonical Scriptures which had been given previous to the coming of the Lord. His allegation, however, that \"a man is able to be without sin, if he wishes,\" was not approved by the bishops in the sense which he had evidently meant it to bear in his book[fn-31-P3156_1229778:165-nf] -as if this was solely in a man's power by free will (for it was contended that he must have meant no less than this by his saying: \"if he wishes\"),-but only in the sense which he actually gave to the passage on the present occasion in his answer; in the very sense, indeed, in which the episcopal judges mentioned the subject in their own interlocution with especial brevity and clearness, that a man is able to be without sin with the help and grace of God. But still it was left undetermined when the saints were to attain to this state of perfection,-whether in the body of this death, or when death shall be swallowed up in victory.","title":"On the Proceedings of Pelagius,","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":7,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_24_book_xviii","source_chapter":36,"source_paragraph":"169","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Daniel and Ezekiel, other two of the greater prophets, also first prophesied in the very captivity of Babylon.

The same Saviour is spoken of in Daniel, where the Son of man appears before the Ancient of days, and receives a kingdom without end, that all nations may serve Him.[fn-14-P1497_805869:76-nf] In the passage quoted from Daniel by the Lord Himself, \"When ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place, let him that readeth understand,\"[fn-14-P1498_806092:77-nf] the number of weeks points not only to Christ, but to the very time of His advent. With the Jews, who look to Christ for salvation as we do, but deny that He has come and suffered, we can argue from actual events. Besides the conversion of the heathen, now so universal, as prophesied of Christ in their own Scriptures, there are the events in the history of the Jews themselves. Their holy place is thrown down, the sacrifice has ceased, and the priest, and the ancient anointing; which was all clearly foretold by Daniel when he prophesied of the anointing of the Most Holy.[fn-14-P1499_806690:78-nf] Now, that all these things have taken place, we ask the Jews for the anointed Most Holy, and they have no answer to give. But it is from the Old Testament that the Jews derive all the knowledge they have of Christ and His advent. Why do they ask John whether he is Christ? Why do they say to the Lord, \"How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou art the Christ, tell us plainly.\" Why do Peter and Andrew and Philip say to Nathanael, \"We have found Messias, which is interpreted Christ,\" but because this name was known to them from the prophecies of their Scriptures? In no other nation were the kings and priests anointed, and called Anointed or Christs. Nor could this symbolical anointing be discontinued till the coming of Him who was thus prefigured. For among all their anointed ones the Jews looked for one who was to save them. But in the mysterious justice of God they were blinded; and thinking only of the power of the Messiah, they did not understand His weakness, in which He died for us. In the book of Wisdom it is prophesied of the Jews: \"Let us condemn him to an ignominious death; for he will be proved in his words. If he is truly the Son of God, He will aid him; and deliver him from the hand of his enemies. Thus they thought, and erred; for their wickedness blinded them.\"[fn-15-P1500_808009:79-nf] These words apply also to those who, in spite of all these evidences, in spite of such a series of prophecies, and of their fulfillment, still deny that Christ is foretold in the Scriptures. As often as they repeat this denial, we can produce fresh proofs, with the help of Him who has made such provision against human perversity, that proofs already given need not be repeated.","title":"Book XII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":7,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_26_book_xx","source_chapter":25,"source_paragraph":"101","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Daniel prophesies of the last judgment in such a way as to indicate that Antichrist shall first come, and to carry on his description to the eternal reign of the saints. For when in prophetic vision he had seen four beasts, signifying four kingdoms, and the fourth conquered by a certain king, who is recognized as Antichrist, and after this the eternal kingdom of the Son of man, that is to say, of Christ, he says, \"My spirit was terrified, I Daniel in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me,\"[fn-39-P3983_2187815:123-nf] etc. Some have interpreted these four kingdoms as signifying those of the Assyrians, Persians, Macedonians, and Romans. They who desire to understand the fitness of this interpretation may read Jerome's book on Daniel, which is written with a sufficiency of care and erudition. But he who reads this passage, even half asleep, cannot fail to see that the kingdom of Antichrist shall fiercely, though for a short time, assail the Church before the last judgment of God shall introduce the eternal reign of the saints. For it is patent from the context that the time, times, and half a time, means a year, and two years, and half a year, that is to say, three years and a half. Sometimes in Scripture the same thing is indicated by months. For though the word times seems to be used here in the Latin indefinitely, that is only because the Latins have no dual, as the Greeks have, and as the Hebrews also are said to have. Times, therefore, is used for two times. As for theten kings, whom, as it seems, Antichrist is to find in the person of ten individuals when he comes, I own I am afraid we may be deceived in this, and that he may come unexpectedly while there are not ten kings living in the Roman world. For what if this number ten signifies the whole number of kings who are to precede his coming, as totality is frequently symbolized by a thousand, or a hundred, or seven, or other numbers, which it is not necessary to recount?","title":"Book XX","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":7,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_20_lecture_xv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"17","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"12.

Great indeed is the multitude; but yet it is little, for the Angels are many more. They are the ninety and nine sheep, but mankind is the single one[fn-21-P2157_607245:125-nf] . For according to the extent of universal space, must we reckon the number of its inhabitants. The whole earth is but as a point in the midst of the one heaven, and yet contains so great a multitude; what a multitude must the heaven which encircles it contain? And must not the heaven of heavens contain unimaginable numbers[fn-21-P2158_607592:126-nf] ? And it is written, Thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him[fn-21-P2159_607730:127-nf] ; not that the multitude is only so great, but because the Prophet could not express more than these. So there will be present at the judgment in that day, God, the Father of all, Jesus Christ being seated with Him, and the Holy Ghost present with Them; and an angel's trumpet shall summon us all to bring our deeds with us. Ought we not then from this time forth to be sore troubled? Think it not a slight doom, O man, even apart from punishment, to be condemned in the presence of so many.

Since, however, the blind leads the blind, they fall into the ditch together. We affirm that, as there are two conditions demonstrated by the prophets to belong to Christ, so these presignified the same number of advents; one, and that the first, was to be in lowliness,[fn-48-P4876_1543459:90-nf] when He had to be led as a sheep to be slain as a victim, and to be as a lamb dumb before the shearer, not opening His mouth, and not fair to look upon.[fn-48-P4877_1543629:91-nf] For, says (the prophet), we have announced concerning Him: \"He is like a tender plant,[fn-48-P4878_1543779:92-nf] like a root out of a thirsty ground; He hath no form nor comeliness; and we beheld Him, and He was without beauty: His form was disfigured; \"[fn-48-P4879_1543984:93-nf] \"marred more than the sons of men; a man stricken with sorrows, and knowing how to bear our infirmity; \"[fn-48-P4880_1544140:94-nf] \"placed by the Father as a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence; \"[fn-48-P4881_1544246:95-nf] \"made by Him a little lower than the angels; \"[fn-48-P4882_1544312:96-nf] declaring Himself to be \"a worm and not a man, a reproach of men, and despised of the people.\"[fn-48-P4883_1544425:97-nf] Now these signs of degradation quite suit His first coming, just as the tokens of His majesty do His second advent, when He shall no longer remain \"a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence,\" but after His rejection become \"the chief corner-stone,\" accepted and elevated to the top place[fn-48-P4884_1544732:98-nf] of the temple, even His church, being that very stone in Daniel, cut out of the mountain, which was to smite and crush the image of the secular kingdom.[fn-48-P4885_1544934:99-nf] Of this advent the same prophet says: \"Behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days; and they brought Him before Him, and there was given Him dominion and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages should serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away; and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.\"[fn-48-P4886_1545363:100-nf] Then indeed He shall have both a glorious form, and an unsullied beauty above the sons of men. \"Thou art fairer,\" says (the Psalmist), \"than the children of men; grace is poured into Thy lips; therefore God hath blessed Thee for ever. Gird Thy sword upon Thy thigh, O most mighty, with Thy glory and Thy majesty.\"[fn-48-P4887_1545702:101-nf] For the Father, after making Him a little lower than the angels, \"will crown Him with glory and honour, and put all things under His feet.\"[fn-48-P4888_1545864:102-nf] \"Then shall they look on Him whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for Him, tribe after tribe; \"[fn-48-P4889_1545992:103-nf] because, no doubt, they once refused to acknowledge Him in the lowliness of His human condition. He is even a man says Jeremiah, and who shall recognise Him Therefore, asks Isaiah, \"who shall declare His generation? \"[fn-48-P4890_1546236:104-nf] So also in Zechariah, Christ Jesus, the true High Priest of the Father, in the person of Joshua, nay, in the very mystery of His name,[fn-48-P4891_1546392:105-nf] is portrayed in a twofold dress with reference to both His advents. At first He is clad in sordid garments, that is to say, in the lowliness of suffering and mortal flesh: then the devil resisted Him, as the instigator of the traitor Judas, not to mention his tempting Him after His baptism: afterwards He was stripped of His first filthy raiment, and adorned with the priestly robe[fn-48-P4892_1546803:106-nf] and mitre, and a pure diadem;[fn-48-P4893_1546848:107-nf] in other words, with the glory and honour of His second advent.[fn-48-P4894_1546933:108-nf] If I may offer, moreover, an interpretation of the two goats which were presented on \"the great day of atonement,\"[fn-48-P4895_1547070:109-nf] do they not also figure the two natures of Christ? They were of like size, and very similar in appearance, owing to the Lord's identity of aspect; because He is not to come in any other form, having to be recognised by those by whom He was also wounded and pierced. One of these goats was bound[fn-48-P4896_1547406:110-nf] with scarlet,[fn-48-P4897_1547440:111-nf] and driven by the people out of the camp[fn-48-P4898_1547525:112-nf] into the wilderness,[fn-48-P4899_1547572:113-nf] amid cursing, and spitting, and pulling, and piercing,[fn-49-P4900_1547650:114-nf] being thus marked with all the signs of the Lord's own passion; while the other, by being offered up for sins, and given to the priests of the temple for meat, afforded proofs of His second appearance, when (after all sins have been expiated) the priests of the spiritual temple, that is, the church, are to enjoy the flesh, as it were,[fn-49-P4901_1548842:115-nf] of the Lord's own grace, whilst the residue go away from salvation without tasting it.[fn-49-P4902_1548996:116-nf] Since, therefore, the first advent was prophetically declared both as most obscure in its types, and as deformed with every kind of indignity, but the second as glorious and altogether worthy of God, they would on this very account, while confining their regards to that which they were easily able both to understand and to believe, even the second advent, be not undeservedly deceived respecting the more obscure, and, at any rate, the more lowly first coming. Accordingly, to this day they deny that their Christ has come, because He has not appeared in majesty, while they ignore the fact that He was to come also in lowliness.","title":"Book III.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":7,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_30_book_iii_","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"75","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Yes, certainly,[fn-51-P5182_1626437:344-nf] you say, I do hope from Him that which amounts in itself to a proof of the diversity (of Christs), God's kingdom in an everlasting and heavenly possession. Besides, your Christ promises to the Jews their primitive condition, with the recovery of their country; and after this life's course is over, repose in Hades[fn-51-P5183_1626765:345-nf] in Abraham's bosom. Oh, most excellent God, when He restores in amnesty[fn-51-P5184_1626858:346-nf] what He took away in wrath! Oh, what a God is yours, who both wounds and heals, creates evil and makes peace! Oh, what a God, that is merciful even down to Hades! I shall have something to say about Abraham's bosom in the proper place.[fn-51-P5185_1627111:347-nf] As for the restoration of Judµa, however, which even the Jews themselves, induced by the names of places and countries, hope for just as it is described,[fn-51-P5186_1627305:348-nf] it would be tedious to state at length[fn-51-P5187_1627399:349-nf] how the figurative[fn-51-P5188_1627435:350-nf] interpretation is spiritually applicable to Christ and His church, and to the character and fruits thereof; besides, the subject has been regularly treated[fn-51-P5189_1627610:351-nf] in another work, which we entitle De Spe Fidelium.[fn-51-P5190_1627678:352-nf] At present, too, it would be superfluous[fn-51-P5191_1628057:353-nf] for this reason, that our inquiry relates to what is promised in heaven, not on earth. But we do confess that a kingdom is promised to us upon the earth, although before heaven, only in another state of existence; inasmuch as it will be after the resurrection for a thousand years in the divinely-built city of Jerusalem,[fn-51-P5192_1628394:354-nf] \"let down from heaven,\"[fn-51-P5193_1628465:355-nf] which the apostle also calls \"our mother from above; \"[fn-51-P5194_1628540:356-nf] and, while declaring that our poli/teuma, or citizenship, is in heaven,[fn-51-P5195_1628632:357-nf] he predicates of it[fn-51-P5196_1628699:358-nf] that it is really a city in heaven. This both Ezekiel had knowledge of[fn-51-P5197_1628786:359-nf] and the Apostle John beheld.[fn-51-P5198_1628843:360-nf] And the word of the new prophecy which is a part of our belief,[fn-51-P5199_1628931:361-nf] attests how it foretold that there would be for a sign a picture of this very city exhibited. to view previous to its manifestation. This prophecy, indeed, has been very lately fulfilled in an expedition to the East.[fn-52-P5200_1629283:362-nf] For it is evident from the testimony of even heathen witnesses, that in Judµa there was suspended in the sky a city early every morning for forty days. As the day advanced, the entire figure of its walls would wane gradually,[fn-52-P5201_1629622:363-nf] and sometimes it would vanish instantly.[fn-52-P5202_1629683:364-nf] We say that this city has been provided by God for receiving the saints on their resurrection, and refreshing them with the abundance of all really spiritual blessings, as a recompense for those which in the world we have either despised or lost; since it is both just and God-worthy that His servants should have their joy in the place where they have also suffered affliction for His name's sake. Of the heavenly kingdom this is the process.[fn-52-P5203_1630210:365-nf] After its thousand years are over, within which period is completed the resurrection of the saints, who rise sooner or later according to their deserts there will ensue the destruction of the world and the conflagration of all things at the judgment: we shall then be changed in a moment into the substance of angels, even by the investiture of an incorruptible nature, and so be removed to that kingdom in heaven of which we have now been treating, just as if it had not been predicted by the Creator, and as if it were proving Christ to belong to the other god and as if he were the first and sole revealer of it. But now learn that it has been, in fact, predicted by the Creator, and that even without prediction it has a claim upon our faith in respect of[fn-52-P5204_1630984:366-nf] the Creator. What appears to be probable to you, when Abraham's seed, after the primal promise of being like the sand of the sea for multitude, is destined likewise. to an equality with the stars of heaven-are not these the indications both of an earthly and a heavenly dispensation?[fn-52-P5205_1631313:367-nf] When Isaac, in blessing his son Jacob, says, \"God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth,\"[fn-52-P5206_1631448:368-nf] are there not in his words examples of both kinds of blessing? Indeed, the very form of the blessing is in this instance worthy of notice. For in relation to Jacob, who is the type of the later and more excellent people, that is to say ourselves,[fn-52-P5207_1631718:369-nf] first comes the promise of the heavenly dew, and afterwards that about the fatness of the earth. So are we first invited to heavenly blessings when we are separated from the world, and afterwards we thus find ourselves in the way of obtaining also earthly blessings. And your own gospel likewise has it in this wise: \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and these things shall be added unto you.\"[fn-52-P5208_1632177:370-nf] But to Esau the blessing promised is an earthly one, which he supplements with a heavenly, after the fatness of the earth, saying, \"Thy dwelling shall be also of the dew of heaven.\"[fn-52-P5209_1632380:371-nf] For the dispensation of the Jews (who were in Esau, the prior of the sons in birth, but the later in affection[fn-52-P5210_1632514:372-nf] ) at first was imbued with earthly blessings through the law, and afterwards brought round to heavenly ones through the gospel by faith. When Jacob sees in his dream the steps of a ladder set upon the earth, and reaching to heaven, with angels ascending and descending thereon, and the Lord standing above, we shall without hesitation venture to suppose,[fn-52-P5211_1633233:373-nf] that by this ladder the Lord has in judgment appointed that the way to heaven is shown to men, whereby some may attain to it, and others fall therefrom. For why, as soon as he awoke out of his sleep, and shook through a dread of the spot, does he fall to an interpretation of his dream? He exclaims, \"How terrible is this place!\" And then adds, \"This is none other than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven!\"[fn-52-P5212_1633692:374-nf] For he had seen Christ the Lord, the temple of God, and also the gate by whom heaven is entered. Now surely he would not have mentioned the gate of heaven, if heaven is not entered in the dispensation of the[fn-52-P5213_1633927:375-nf] Creator. But there is now a gate provided by Christ, which admits and conducts to glory. Of this Amos says: \"He buildeth His ascensions into heaven; \"[fn-52-P5214_1634091:376-nf] certainly not for Himself alone, but for His people also, who will be with Him. \"And Thou shall bind them about Thee,\" says he, \"like the adornment of a bride.\"[fn-52-P5215_1634272:377-nf] Accordingly the Spirit, admiring such as soar up to the celestial realms by these ascensions, says, \"They fly, as if they were kites; they fly as clouds, and as young doves, unto me\"[fn-52-P5216_1634477:378-nf] -that is, simply like a dove.[fn-52-P5217_1634526:379-nf] For we shall, according to the apostle, be caught up into the clouds to meet the Lord (even the Son of man, who shall come in the clouds, according to Daniel[fn-52-P5218_1634763:380-nf] ) and so shall we ever be with the Lord,[fn-52-P5219_1634824:381-nf] so long as He remains both on the earth and in heaven, who, against such as are thankless for both one promise and the other, calls the elements themselves to witness: \"Hear, O heaven, and give ear, O earth.\"[fn-52-P5220_1635058:382-nf] Now, for my own part indeed, even though Scripture held out no hand of heavenly hope to me (as, in fact, it so often does), I should still possess a sufficient presumption[fn-52-P5221_1635248:383-nf] of even this promise, in my present enjoyment of the earthly gift; and I should look out for something also of the heavenly, from Him who is the God of heaven as well as of earth. I should thus believe that the Christ who promises the higher blessings is (the Son) of Him who had also promised the lower ones; who had, moreover, afforded proofs of greater gifts by smaller ones; who had reserved for His Christ alone this revelation[fn-52-P5222_1635702:384-nf] of a (perhaps[fn-52-P5223_1635735:385-nf] ) unheard of kingdom, so that, while the earthly glory was announced by His servants, the heavenly might have God Himself for its messenger. You, however, argue for another Christ, from the very circumstance that He proclaims a new kingdom. You ought first to bring forward some example of His beneficence,[fn-52-P5224_1636059:386-nf] that I may have no good reason for doubting the credibility of the great promise, which you say ought to be hoped for; nay, it is before all things necessary that you should prove that a heaven belongs to Him, whom you declare to be a promiser of heavenly things. As it is, you invite us to dinner, but do not point out your house; you assert a kingdom, but show us no royal state.[fn-52-P5225_1636461:387-nf] Can it be that your Christ promises a kingdom of heaven, without having a heaven; as He displayed Himself man, without having flesh?

For, says Isaiah, \"they shall see the glory of the Lord, and the excellency of our God.\"[fn-55-P5546_1703335:282-nf] What glory, and what excellency? \"Be strong, ye weak hands, and ye feeble knees: \"[fn-55-P5547_1703439:283-nf] this refers to the palsy. \"Be strong; fear not.\"[fn-55-P5548_1703528:284-nf] Be strong is not vainly repeated, nor is fear not vainly added; because with the renewal of the limbs there was to be, according to the promise, a restoration also of bodily energies: \"Arise, and take up thy couch; \"and likewise moral courage[fn-55-P5549_1703793:285-nf] not to be afraid of those who should say, \"Who can forgive sins, but God alone? \"So that you have here not only the fulfilment of the prophecy which promised a particular kind of healing, but also of the symptoms which followed the cure. In like manner, you should also recognise Christ in the same prophet as the forgiver of sins. \"For,\" he says, \"He shall remit to many their sins, and shall Himself take away our sins.\"[fn-55-P5550_1704238:286-nf] For in an earlier passage, speaking in the person of the Lord himself, he had said: \"Even though your sins be as scarlet, I will make them as white as snow; even though they be like crimson, I will whiten them as wool.\"[fn-55-P5551_1704510:287-nf] In the scarlet colour He indicates the blood of the prophets; in the crimson, that of the Lord, as the brighter. Concerning the forgiveness of sins, Micah also says: \"Who is a God like unto Thee? pardoning iniquity, and passing by the transgressions of the remnant of Thine heritage. He retaineth not His anger as a testimony against them, because He delighteth in mercy. He will turn again, and will have compassion upon us; He wipeth away our iniquities, and casteth our sins into the depths of the sea.\"[fn-55-P5552_1705036:288-nf] Now, if nothing of this sort had been predicted of Christ, I should find in the Creator examples of such a benignity as would hold out to me the promise of similar affections also in the Son of whom He is the Father. I see how the Ninevites obtained forgiveness of their sins from the Creator[fn-55-P5553_1705354:289-nf] -not to say from Christ, even then, because from the beginning He acted in the Father's name. I read, too, how that, when David acknowledged his sin against Uriah, the prophet Nathan said unto him, \"The Lord hath cancelled[fn-55-P5554_1705599:290-nf] thy sin, and thou shalt not die; \"[fn-55-P5555_1705654:291-nf] how king Ahab in like manner, the husband of Jezebel, guilty of idolatry and of the blood of Naboth, obtained pardon because of his repentance;[fn-55-P5556_1705821:292-nf] and how Jonathan the son of Saul blotted out by his deprecation the guilt of a violated fast.[fn-55-P5557_1705939:293-nf] Why should I recount the frequent restoration of the nation itself after the forgiveness of their sins?-by that God, indeed, who will have mercy rather than sacrifice, and a sinner's repentance rather than his death.[fn-55-P5558_1706205:294-nf] You will first have to deny that the Creator ever forgave sins; then you must in reason show[fn-55-P5559_1706323:295-nf] that He never ordained any such prerogative for His Christ; and so you will prove how novel is that boasted[fn-55-P5560_1706466:296-nf] benevolence of the, of course, novel Christ when you shall have proved that it is neither compatible with[fn-55-P5561_1706586:297-nf] the Creator nor predicted by the Creator. But whether to remit sins can appertain to one who is said to be unable to retain them, and whether to absolve can belong to him who is incompetent even to condemn, and whether to forgive is suitable to him against whom no offence can be committed, are questions which we have encountered elsewhere,[fn-55-P5562_1706942:298-nf] when we preferred to drop suggestions[fn-55-P5563_1707019:299-nf] rather than treat them anew.[fn-55-P5564_1707065:300-nf] Concerning the Son of man our rule[fn-55-P5565_1707151:301-nf] is a twofold one: that Christ cannot lie, so as to declare Himself the Son of man, if He be not truly so; nor can He be constituted the Son of man, unless He be born of a human parent, either father or mother. And then the discussion will turn on the point, of which human parent He ought to be accounted the son-of the father or the mother? Since He is (begotten) of God the Father, He is not, of course, (the son) of a human father. If He is not of a human father, it follows that He must be (the son) of a human mother. If of a human mother, it is evident that she must be a virgin. For to whom a human father is not ascribed, to his mother a husband will not be reckoned; and then to what mother a husband is not reckoned, the condition of virginity belongs.[fn-55-P5566_1707935:302-nf] But if His mother be not a virgin, two fathers will have to be reckoned to Him-a divine and a human one. For she must have a husband, not to be a virgin; and by having a husband, she would cause two fathers-one divine, the other human-to accrue to Him, who would thus be Son both of God and of a man. Such a nativity (if one may call it so)[fn-55-P5567_1708398:303-nf] the mythic stories assign to Castor or to Hercules. Now, if this distinction be observed, that is to say, if He be Son of man as born of His mother, because not begotten of a father, and His mother be a virgin, because His father is not human-He will be that Christ whom Isaiah foretold that a virgin should conceive,[fn-55-P5568_1708733:304-nf] On what principle you, Marcion, can admit Him Son of man, I cannot possibly see. If through a human father, then you deny him to be Son of God; if through a divine one also,[fn-55-P5569_1708929:305-nf] then you make Christ the Hercules of fable; if through a human mother only, then you concede my point; if not through a human father also,[fn-55-P5570_1709086:306-nf] then He is not the son of any man,[fn-55-P5571_1709145:307-nf] and He must have been guilty of a lie for having declared Himself to be what He was not. One thing alone can help you in your difficulty: boldness on your part either to surname your God as actually the human father of Christ, as Valentinus did[fn-55-P5572_1709445:308-nf] with his ¦on; or else to deny that the Virgin was human, which even Valentinus did not do. What now, if Christ be described[fn-55-P5573_1709634:309-nf] in Daniel by this very title of \"Son of man? \"Is not this enough to prove that He is the Christ of prophecy? For if He gives Himself that appellation which was provided in the prophecy for the Christ of the Creator, He undoubtedly offers Himself to be understood as Him to whom (the appellation) was assigned by the prophet. But perhaps[fn-55-P5574_1709989:310-nf] it can be regarded as a simple identity of names;[fn-55-P5575_1710056:311-nf] and yet we have maintained[fn-55-P5576_1710116:312-nf] that neither Christ nor Jesus ought to have been called by these names, if they possessed any condition of diversity. But as regards the appellation \"Son of man,\" in as far as it Occurs by accident,[fn-55-P5577_1710370:313-nf] in so far there is a difficulty in its occurrence along with[fn-55-P5578_1710461:314-nf] a casual identity of names. For it is of pure[fn-55-P5579_1710521:315-nf] accident, especially when the same cause does not appear[fn-55-P5580_1710594:316-nf] whereby the identity may be occasioned. And therefore, if Marcion's Christ be also said to be born of man, then he too would receive an identical appellation, and there would be two Sons of man, as also two Christs and two Jesuses. Therefore, since the appellation is the sole right of Him in whom it has a suitable reason,[fn-55-P5581_1710939:317-nf] if it be claimed for another in whom there is an identity of name, but not of appellation,[fn-55-P5582_1711045:318-nf] then the identity of name even looks suspicious in him for whom is claimed without reason the identity of appellation. And it follows that He must be believed to be One and the Same, who is found to be the more fit to receive both the name and the appellation; while the other is excluded, who has no right to the appellation, because he has no reason to show for it. Nor will any other be better entitled to both than He who is the earlier, and has had allotted to Him the name of Christ and the appellation of Son of man, even the Jesus of the Creator. It was He who was seen by the king of Babylon in the furnace with His martyrs: \"the fourth, who was like the Son of man.\"[fn-55-P5583_1711884:319-nf] He also was revealed to Daniel himself expressly as \"the Son of man, coming in the clouds of heaven\" as a Judge, as also the Scripture shows.[fn-55-P5584_1712047:320-nf] What I have advanced might have been sufficient concerning the designation in prophecy of the Son of man. But the Scripture offers me further information, even in the interpretation of the Lord Himself. For when the Jews, who looked at Him as merely man, and were not yet sure that He was God also, as being likewise the Son of God, rightly enough said that a man could not forgive sins, but God alone, why did He not, following up their point[fn-55-P5585_1712512:321-nf] about man, answer them, that He[fn-55-P5586_1712579:322-nf] had power to remit sins; inasmuch as, when He mentioned the Son of man, He also named a human being? except it were because He wanted, by help of the very designation \"Son of man\" from the book of Daniel, so to induce them to reflect[fn-55-P5587_1712839:323-nf] as to show them that He who remitted sins was God and man-that only Son of man, indeed, in the prophecy of Daniel, who had obtained the power of judging, and thereby, of course, of forgiving sins likewise (for He who judges also absolves); so that, when once that objection of theirs[fn-55-P5588_1713143:324-nf] was shattered to pieces by their recollection of Scripture, they might the more easily acknowledge Him to be the Son of man Himself by His own actual forgiveness of sins. I make one more observation,[fn-55-P5589_1713365:325-nf] how that He has nowhere as yet professed Himself to be the Son of God-but for the first time in this passage, in which for the first time He has remitted sins; that is, in which for the first time He has used His function of judgment, by the absolution. All that the opposite side has to allege in argument against these things, (I beg you) carefully weigh[fn-55-P5590_1713738:326-nf] what it amounts to. For it must needs strain itself to such a pitch of infatuation as, on the one hand, to maintain that (their Christ) is also Son of man, in order to save Him from the charge of falsehood; and, on the other hand, to deny that He was born of woman, lest they grant that He was the Virgin's son. Since, however, the divine authority and the nature of the case, and common sense, do not admit this insane position of the heretics, we have here the opportunity of putting in a veto[fn-55-P5591_1714251:327-nf] in the briefest possible terms, on the substance of Christ's body, against Marcion's phantoms. Since He is born of man, being the Son of man. He is body derived from body.[fn-55-P5592_1714445:328-nf] You may, I assure you,[fn-55-P5593_1714494:329-nf] more easily find a man born without a heart or without brains, like Marcion himself, than without a body, like Marcion's Christ. And let this be the limit to your examination of the heart, or, at any rate, the brains of the heretic of Pontus.[fn-55-P5594_1714780:330-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":7,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":41,"source_paragraph":"129","folder":"ANF-03","text":"That \"the very powers also of heaven have to be shaken,\"[fn-69-P6913_2011131:1559-nf] you may find in Joel: \"And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth-blood and fire, and pillars of smoke; the sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come.\"[fn-69-P6914_2011388:1560-nf] In Habakkuk also you have this statement: \"With rivers shall the earth be cleaved; the nations shall see thee, and be in pangs.

But what does the Lord say afterwards? \"And then shall they see the Son of man coming from the heavens with very great power. And when these things shall come to pass, ye shall look up, and raise your heads; for your redemption hath come near,\" that is, at the time of the kingdom, of which the parable itself treats.[fn-69-P6917_2012481:1563-nf] \"So likewise ye, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.\"[fn-69-P6918_2012620:1564-nf] This will be the great day of the Lord, and of the glorious coming of the Son of man from heaven, of which Daniel wrote: \"Behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven,\"[fn-69-P6919_2012830:1565-nf] etc. \"And there was given unto Him the kingly power,\"[fn-69-P6920_2012907:1566-nf] which (in the parable) \"He went away into a far country to receive for Himself,\" leaving money to His servants wherewithal to trade and get increase[fn-69-P6921_2013079:1567-nf] -even (that universal kingdom of) all nations, which in the Psalm the Father had promised to give to Him: Ask of me, and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance.\"[fn-69-P6922_2013285:1568-nf] \"And all that glory shall serve Him; His dominion shall be an everlasting one, which shall not be taker from Him, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed,\"[fn-69-P6923_2013471:1569-nf] because in it \"men shall not die, neither shall they marry, but be like the angels.\"[fn-69-P6924_2013579:1570-nf] It is about the same advent of the Son of man and the benefits thereof that we read in Habakkuk: \"Thou wentest forth for the salvation of Thy people, even to save Thine anointed ones,[fn-69-P6925_2013789:1571-nf] -in other words, those who shall look up and lift their heads, being redeemed in the time of His kingdom. Since, therefore, these descriptions of the promises, on the one hand, agree together, as do also those of the great catastrophes, on the other-both in the predictions of the prophets and the declarations of the Lord, it will be impossible for you to interpose any distinction between them, as if the catastrophes could be referred to the Creator, as the terrible God, being such as the good god (of Marcion) ought not to permit, much less expect-whilst the promises should be ascribed to the good god, being such as the Creator, in His ignorance of the said god, could not have predicted. If, however, He did predict these promises as His own, since they differ in no respect from the promises of Christ, He will be a match in the freeness of His gifts with the good god himself; and evidently no more will have been promised by your Christ than by my Son of man. (If you examine) the whole passage of this Gospel Scripture, from the inquiry of the disciples[fn-69-P6926_2014878:1572-nf] down to the parable of the fig-tree[fn-69-P6927_2014939:1573-nf] you will find the sense in its connection suit in every point the Son of man, so that it consistently ascribes to Him both the sorrows and the joys, and the catastrophes and the promises; nor can you separate them from Him in either respect. For as much, then, as there is but one Son of man whose advent is placed between the two issues of catastrophe and promise, it must needs follow that to that one Son of man belong both the judgments upon the nations, and the prayers of the saints. He who thus comes in midway so as to be common to both issues, will terminate one of them by inflicting judgment on the nations at His coming; and will at the same time commence the other by fulfilling the prayers of His saints: so that if (on the one hand) you grant that the coming of the Son of man is (the advent) of my Christ, then, when you ascribe to Him the infliction of the judgments which precede His appearance, you are compelled also to assign to Him the blessings which issue from the same. If (on the other hand) you will have it that it is the coming of your Christ, then, when you ascribe to him the blessings which are to be the result of his advent, you are obliged to impute to him likewise the infliction of the evils which precede his appearance. For the evils which precede, and the blessings which immediately follow, the coming of the Son of man, are both alike indissolubly connected with that event. Consider, therefore, which of the two Christs you choose to place in the person of the Son of man, to whom you may refer the execution of the two dispensations. You make either the Creator a most beneficent God, or else your own god terrible in his nature! Reflect, in short, on the picture presented in the parable: \"Behold the fig-tree, and all the trees; when they produce their fruit, men know that summer is at hand. So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is very near.\"[fn-69-P6928_2016904:1574-nf] Now, if the fructification of the common trees[fn-69-P6929_2016977:1575-nf] be an antecedent sign of the approach of summer, so in like manner do the great conflicts of the world indicate the arrival of that kingdom which they precede. But every sign is His, to whom belong the thing of which it is the sign; and to everything is appointed its sign by Him to whom the thing belongs. If, therefore, these tribulations are the signs of the kingdom, just as the maturity of the trees is of the summer, it follows that the kingdom is the Creator's to whom are ascribed the tribulations which are the signs of the kingdom. Since the beneficent Deity had premised that these things must needs come to pass, although so terrible and dreadful, as they had been predicted by the law and the prophets, therefore He did not destroy the law and the prophets, when He affirmed that what had been foretold therein must be certainly fulfilled. He further declares, \"that heaven and earth shall not pass away till all things be fulfilled.\"[fn-69-P6930_2017948:1576-nf] What things, pray, are these? Are they the things which the Creator made? Then the elements will tractably endure the accomplishment of their Maker's dispensation. If, however, they emanate from your excellent god, I much doubt whether[fn-69-P6931_2018207:1577-nf] the heaven and earth will peaceably allow the completion of things which their Creator's enemy has determined! If the Creator quietly submits to this, then He is no \"jealous God.\" But let heaven and earth pass away, since their Lord has so determined; only let His word remain for evermore! And so Isaiah predicted that it should.[fn-69-P6932_2018558:1578-nf] Let the disciples also be warned, \"lest their hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and cares of this world; and so that day come upon them unawares, like a snare \"[fn-69-P6933_2018761:1579-nf] -if indeed they should forget God amidst the abundance and occupation of the world. Like this will be found the admonition of Moses,-so that He who delivers from \"the snare\" of that day is none other than He who so long before addressed to men the same admonition[fn-69-P6934_2019117:1580-nf] Some places there were in Jerusalem where to teach; other places outside Jerusalem whither to retire[fn-69-P6935_2019252:1581-nf] -\"in the day-time He was teaching in the temple; \"just as He had foretold by Hosea: \"In my house did they find me, and there did I speak with them.\"[fn-69-P6936_2019424:1582-nf] \"But at night He went out to the Mount of Olives.\" For thus had Zechariah pointed out: \"And His feet shall stand in that day on the Mount of Olives.\"[fn-69-P6937_2019658:1583-nf] Fit hours for an audience there also were. \"Early in the morning\"[fn-69-P6938_2019747:1584-nf] must they resort to Him, who (having said by Isaiah, \"The Lord giveth me the tongue of the learned\") added, \"He hath appointed me the morning, and hath also given me an ear to hear.\"[fn-69-P6939_2019953:1585-nf] Now if this is to destroy the prophets,[fn-69-P6940_2020013:1586-nf] what will it be to fulfil them?","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":7,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":41,"source_paragraph":"129","folder":"ANF-03","text":"That \"the very powers also of heaven have to be shaken,\"[fn-69-P6913_2011131:1559-nf] you may find in Joel: \"And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth-blood and fire, and pillars of smoke; the sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come.\"[fn-69-P6914_2011388:1560-nf] In Habakkuk also you have this statement: \"With rivers shall the earth be cleaved; the nations shall see thee, and be in pangs.

Consider, therefore, which of the two Christs you choose to place in the person of the Son of man, to whom you may refer the execution of the two dispensations. You make either the Creator a most beneficent God, or else your own god terrible in his nature! Reflect, in short, on the picture presented in the parable: \"Behold the fig-tree, and all the trees; when they produce their fruit, men know that summer is at hand. So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is very near.\"[fn-69-P6928_2016904:1574-nf] Now, if the fructification of the common trees[fn-69-P6929_2016977:1575-nf] be an antecedent sign of the approach of summer, so in like manner do the great conflicts of the world indicate the arrival of that kingdom which they precede. But every sign is His, to whom belong the thing of which it is the sign; and to everything is appointed its sign by Him to whom the thing belongs. If, therefore, these tribulations are the signs of the kingdom, just as the maturity of the trees is of the summer, it follows that the kingdom is the Creator's to whom are ascribed the tribulations which are the signs of the kingdom. Since the beneficent Deity had premised that these things must needs come to pass, although so terrible and dreadful, as they had been predicted by the law and the prophets, therefore He did not destroy the law and the prophets, when He affirmed that what had been foretold therein must be certainly fulfilled. He further declares, \"that heaven and earth shall not pass away till all things be fulfilled.\"[fn-69-P6930_2017948:1576-nf] What things, pray, are these? Are they the things which the Creator made? Then the elements will tractably endure the accomplishment of their Maker's dispensation. If, however, they emanate from your excellent god, I much doubt whether[fn-69-P6931_2018207:1577-nf] the heaven and earth will peaceably allow the completion of things which their Creator's enemy has determined! If the Creator quietly submits to this, then He is no \"jealous God.\" But let heaven and earth pass away, since their Lord has so determined; only let His word remain for evermore! And so Isaiah predicted that it should.[fn-69-P6932_2018558:1578-nf] Let the disciples also be warned, \"lest their hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and cares of this world; and so that day come upon them unawares, like a snare \"[fn-69-P6933_2018761:1579-nf] -if indeed they should forget God amidst the abundance and occupation of the world. Like this will be found the admonition of Moses,-so that He who delivers from \"the snare\" of that day is none other than He who so long before addressed to men the same admonition[fn-69-P6934_2019117:1580-nf] Some places there were in Jerusalem where to teach; other places outside Jerusalem whither to retire[fn-69-P6935_2019252:1581-nf] -\"in the day-time He was teaching in the temple; \"just as He had foretold by Hosea: \"In my house did they find me, and there did I speak with them.\"[fn-69-P6936_2019424:1582-nf] \"But at night He went out to the Mount of Olives.\" For thus had Zechariah pointed out: \"And His feet shall stand in that day on the Mount of Olives.\"[fn-69-P6937_2019658:1583-nf] Fit hours for an audience there also were. \"Early in the morning\"[fn-69-P6938_2019747:1584-nf] must they resort to Him, who (having said by Isaiah, \"The Lord giveth me the tongue of the learned\") added, \"He hath appointed me the morning, and hath also given me an ear to hear.\"[fn-69-P6939_2019953:1585-nf] Now if this is to destroy the prophets,[fn-69-P6940_2020013:1586-nf] what will it be to fulfil them?","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":7,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":41,"source_paragraph":"129","folder":"ANF-03","text":"That \"the very powers also of heaven have to be shaken,\"[fn-69-P6913_2011131:1559-nf] you may find in Joel: \"And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth-blood and fire, and pillars of smoke; the sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come.\"[fn-69-P6914_2011388:1560-nf] In Habakkuk also you have this statement: \"With rivers shall the earth be cleaved; the nations shall see thee, and be in pangs. Thou shalt disperse the waters with thy step; the deep uttered its voice; the height of its fear was raised;[fn-69-P6915_2011652:1561-nf] the sun and the moon stood still in their course; into light shall thy coruscations go; and thy shield shall be (like) the glittering of the lightning's flash; in thine anger thou shalt grind the earth, and shalt thresh the nations in thy wrath.\"[fn-69-P6916_2011954:1562-nf] There is thus an agreement, I apprehend, between the sayings of the Lord and of the prophets touching the shaking of the earth, and the elements, and the nations thereof. But what does the Lord say afterwards? \"And then shall they see the Son of man coming from the heavens with very great power. And when these things shall come to pass, ye shall look up, and raise your heads; for your redemption hath come near,\" that is, at the time of the kingdom, of which the parable itself treats.[fn-69-P6917_2012481:1563-nf] \"So likewise ye, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.\"[fn-69-P6918_2012620:1564-nf] This will be the great day of the Lord, and of the glorious coming of the Son of man from heaven, of which Daniel wrote: \"Behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven,\"[fn-69-P6919_2012830:1565-nf] etc. \"And there was given unto Him the kingly power,\"[fn-69-P6920_2012907:1566-nf] which (in the parable) \"He went away into a far country to receive for Himself,\" leaving money to His servants wherewithal to trade and get increase[fn-69-P6921_2013079:1567-nf] -even (that universal kingdom of) all nations, which in the Psalm the Father had promised to give to Him: Ask of me, and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance.\"[fn-69-P6922_2013285:1568-nf] \"And all that glory shall serve Him; His dominion shall be an everlasting one, which shall not be taker from Him, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed,\"[fn-69-P6923_2013471:1569-nf] because in it \"men shall not die, neither shall they marry, but be like the angels.\"[fn-69-P6924_2013579:1570-nf] It is about the same advent of the Son of man and the benefits thereof that we read in Habakkuk: \"Thou wentest forth for the salvation of Thy people, even to save Thine anointed ones,[fn-69-P6925_2013789:1571-nf] -in other words, those who shall look up and lift their heads, being redeemed in the time of His kingdom. Since, therefore, these descriptions of the promises, on the one hand, agree together, as do also those of the great catastrophes, on the other-both in the predictions of the prophets and the declarations of the Lord, it will be impossible for you to interpose any distinction between them, as if the catastrophes could be referred to the Creator, as the terrible God, being such as the good god (of Marcion) ought not to permit, much less expect-whilst the promises should be ascribed to the good god, being such as the Creator, in His ignorance of the said god, could not have predicted. If, however, He did predict these promises as His own, since they differ in no respect from the promises of Christ, He will be a match in the freeness of His gifts with the good god himself; and evidently no more will have been promised by your Christ than by my Son of man. (If you examine) the whole passage of this Gospel Scripture, from the inquiry of the disciples[fn-69-P6926_2014878:1572-nf] down to the parable of the fig-tree[fn-69-P6927_2014939:1573-nf] you will find the sense in its connection suit in every point the Son of man, so that it consistently ascribes to Him both the sorrows and the joys, and the catastrophes and the promises; nor can you separate them from Him in either respect. For as much, then, as there is but one Son of man whose advent is placed between the two issues of catastrophe and promise, it must needs follow that to that one Son of man belong both the judgments upon the nations, and the prayers of the saints. He who thus comes in midway so as to be common to both issues, will terminate one of them by inflicting judgment on the nations at His coming; and will at the same time commence the other by fulfilling the prayers of His saints: so that if (on the one hand) you grant that the coming of the Son of man is (the advent) of my Christ, then, when you ascribe to Him the infliction of the judgments which precede His appearance, you are compelled also to assign to Him the blessings which issue from the same. If (on the other hand) you will have it that it is the coming of your Christ, then, when you ascribe to him the blessings which are to be the result of his advent, you are obliged to impute to him likewise the infliction of the evils which precede his appearance. For the evils which precede, and the blessings which immediately follow, the coming of the Son of man, are both alike indissolubly connected with that event. Consider, therefore, which of the two Christs you choose to place in the person of the Son of man, to whom you may refer the execution of the two dispensations. You make either the Creator a most beneficent God, or else your own god terrible in his nature! Reflect, in short, on the picture presented in the parable: \"Behold the fig-tree, and all the trees; when they produce their fruit, men know that summer is at hand.

If he were meant to escape with impunity, the \"woe\" was an idle word; if not, he was of course to be punished by Him against whom he had committed the sin of treachery. Now, if He knowingly permitted the man, whom He[fn-69-P6972_2028545:1612-nf] deliberately elected to be one of His companions, to plunge into so great a crime, you must no longer use an argument against the Creator in Adam's case, which may now recoil on your own God:[fn-69-P6973_2028752:1613-nf] either that he was ignorant, and had no foresight to hinder the future sinner;[fn-69-P6974_2028966:1614-nf] or that he was unable to hinder him, even if he was ignorant;[fn-69-P6975_2029057:1615-nf] or else that he was unwilling, even if he had the foreknowledge and the ability; and so deserved the stigma of maliciousness, in having permitted the man of his own choice to perish in his sin. I advise you therefore (willingly) to acknowledge the Creator in that god of yours, rather than against your will to be assimilating your excellent god to Him. For in the case of Peter,[fn-69-P6976_2029560:1616-nf] too, he gives you proof that he is a jealous God, when he destined the apostle, after his presumptuous protestations of zeal, to a flat denial of him, rather than prevent his fall.[fn-69-P6977_2029901:1617-nf] The Christ of the prophets was destined, moreover, to be betrayed with a kiss,[fn-69-P6978_2030014:1618-nf] for He was the Son indeed of Him who was \"honoured with the lips\" by the people.[fn-69-P6979_2030122:1619-nf] When led before the council, He is asked whether He is the Christ.[fn-69-P6980_2030213:1620-nf] Of what Christ could the Jews have inquired[fn-69-P6981_2030285:1621-nf] but their own? Why, therefore, did He not, even at that moment, declare to them the rival (Christ)? You reply, In order that He might be able to suffer. In other words, that this most excellent god might plunge men into crime, whom he was still keeping in ignorance. But even if he had told them, he would yet have to suffer. For he said, \"If I tell you, ye will not believe.\"[fn-69-P6982_2030795:1622-nf] And refusing to believe, they would have continued to insist on his death. And would he not even more probably still have had to suffer, if had announced himself as sent by the rival god, and as being, therefore, the enemy of the Creator? It was not, then, in order that He might suffer, that He at that critical moment refrained from proclaiming[fn-69-P6983_2031166:1623-nf] Himself the other Christ, but because they wanted to extort a confession from His mouth, which they did not mean to believe even if He had given it to them, whereas it was their bounden duty to have acknowledged Him in consequence of His works, which were fulfilling their Scriptures. It was thus plainly His course to keep Himself at that moment unrevealed,[fn-69-P6984_2031556:1624-nf] because a spontaneous recognition was due to Him. But yet for all this, He with a solemn gesture[fn-69-P6985_2031773:1625-nf] says, \"Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.\"[fn-69-P6986_2031927:1626-nf] For it was on the authority of the prophecy of Daniel that He intimated to them that He was \"the Son of man,\"[fn-69-P6987_2032061:1627-nf] and of David's Psalm, that He would \"sit at the right hand of God.\"[fn-69-P6988_2032152:1628-nf] Accordingly, after He had said this, and so suggested a comparison of the Scripture, a ray of light did seem to show them whom He would have them understand Him to be; for they say: \"Art thou then the Son of God? \"[fn-69-P6989_2032387:1629-nf] Of what God, but of Him whom alone they knew? Of what God but of Him whom they remembered in the Psalm as having said to His Son, \"Sit Thou on my right hand? \"Then He answered, \"Ye say that I am; \"[fn-69-P6990_2032610:1630-nf] as if He meant: It is ye who say this-not I. But at the same time He allowed Himself to be all that they had said, in this their second question.[fn-69-P6991_2032780:1631-nf] By what means, however, are you going to prove to us that they pronounced the sentence \"Ergo tu filius Dei es\" interrogatively, and not affirmatively?[fn-69-P6992_2033045:1632-nf] Just as, (on the one hand, ) because He had shown them in an indirect manner,[fn-69-P6993_2033189:1633-nf] by passages of Scripture, that they ought to regard Him as the Son of God, they therefore meant their own words, \"Thou art then the Son of God,\" to be taken in a like (indirect) sense,[fn-69-P6994_2033392:1634-nf] as much as to say, \"You do not wish to say this of yourself plainly,[fn-69-P6995_2033494:1635-nf] so, (on the other hand, ) He likewise answered them, \"Ye say that I am,\" in a sense equally free from doubt, even affirmatively;[fn-69-P6996_2033640:1636-nf] and so completely was His statement to this effect, that they insisted on accepting that sense which His statement indicated.[fn-69-P6997_2033817:1637-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":7,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"171","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In Daniel: \"I saw in a vision by night, and behold as it were the Son of man, coming in the clouds of heaven, came even to the Ancient of days, and stood in His sight.

For, as I have read in some writer of Valentinus' wretched faction,[fn-95-P9505_2608542:220-nf] they refuse at the outset to believe that a human and earthly substance was created[fn-95-P9506_2608646:221-nf] for Christ, lest the Lord should be regarded as inferior to the angels, who are not formed of earthly flesh; whence, too, it would be necessary that, if His flesh were like ours, it should be similarly born, not of the Spirit, nor of God, but of the will of man. Why, moreover, should it be born, not of corruptible [seed], but of incorruptible? Why, again, since His flesh has both risen and returned to heaven, is not ours, being like His, also taken up at once? Or else, why does not His flesh, since it is like ours, return in like manner to the ground, and suffer dissolution? Such objections even the heathen used constantly to bandy about.[fn-95-P9507_2609313:222-nf] Was the Son of God reduced to such a depth of degradation Again, if He rose again as a precedent for our hope, how is it that nothing like it has been thought desirable (to happen) to ourselves?[fn-95-P9508_2609551:223-nf] Such views are not improper for heathens and they are fit and natural for the heretics too. For, indeed, what difference is there between them, except it be that the heathen, in not believing, do believe; while the heretics, in believing, do not believe? Then, again, they read: \"Thou madest Him a little less than angels; \"[fn-95-P9509_2609971:224-nf] and they deny the lower nature of that Christ who declares Himself to be, \"not a man, but a worm; \"[fn-95-P9510_2610097:225-nf] who also had \"no form nor comeliness, but His form was ignoble, despised more than all men, a man in suffering, and acquainted with the bearing of weakness.\"[fn-95-P9511_2610275:226-nf] Here they discover a human being mingled with a divine one and so they deny the manhood.

Christ has not yet subdued His enemies, so as to be able to triumph over them in company with His friends.","title":"On the Flesh of Christ.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":7,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_31_on_virginity","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"80","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":" It would therefore be to their profit, for the young to refrain from laying down[fn-28-P2897_1945236:176-nf] for themselves their future course in this profession; and indeed, examples of holy lives for them to follow are not wanting in the living generation[fn-28-P2898_1945457:177-nf] . Now, if ever before, saintliness abounds and penetrates our world; by gradual advances it has reached the highest mark of perfectness; and one who follows such footsteps in his daily rounds may catch this halo; one who tracks the scent of this preceding perfume may be drenched in the sweet odours of Christ Himself. As, when one torch has been fired, flame is transmitted to all the neighbouring candlesticks, without either the first light being lessened or blazing with unequal brilliance on the other points where it has been caught; so the saintliness of a life is transmitted from him who has achieved it, to those who come within his circle; for there is truth in the Prophet's saying[fn-28-P2899_1946733:178-nf] , that one who lives with a man who is \"holy\" and \"clean\" and \"elect,\" will become such himself. If you would wish to know the sure signs, which will secure you the real model, it is not hard to take a sketch from life. If you see a man so standing between death and life, as to select from each helps for the contemplative course, never letting death's stupor paralyze his zeal to keep all the commandments, nor yet placing both feet in the world of the living, since he has weaned himself from secular ambitions;-a man who remains more insensate than the dead themselves to everything that is found on examination to be living for the flesh, but instinct with life and energy and strength in the achievements of virtue, which are the sure marks of the spiritual life;-then look to that man for the rule of your life; let him be the leading light of your course of devotion, as the constellations that never set are to the pilot; imitate his youth and his gray hairs: or, rather, imitate the old man and the stripling who are joined in him; for even now in his declining years time has not blunted the keen activity of his soul, nor was his youth active in the sphere of youth's well-known employments; in both seasons of life he has shown a wonderful combination of opposites, or rather an exchange of the peculiar qualities of each; for in age he shows, in the direction of the good, a young man's energy, while, in the hours of youth, in the direction of evil, his passions were powerless. If you wish to know what were the passions of that glorious youth of his, you will have for your imitation the intensity and glow of his godlike love of wisdom, which grew with him from his childhood, and has continued with him into his old age. But if you cannot gaze upon him, as the weak-sighted cannot gaze upon the sun, at all events watch that band of holy men who are ranged beneath him, and who by the illumination of their lives are a model for this age. God has placed them as a beacon for us who live around; many among them have been young men there in their prime, and have grown gray in the unbroken practice of continence and temperance; they were old in reasonableness before their time, and in character outstripped their years. The only love they tasted was that of wisdom; not that their natural instincts were different from the rest; for in all alike \"the flesh lusteth against the spirit[fn-29-P2900_1949181:179-nf] ;\" but they listened to some purpose to him who said that Temperance \"is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her[fn-29-P2901_1949319:180-nf] ;\" and they sailed across the swelling billows of existence upon this tree of life, as upon a skiff; and anchored in the haven of the will of God; enviable now after so fair a voyage, they rest their souls in that sunny cloudless calm. They now ride safe themselves at the anchor of a good hope, far out of reach of the tumult of the billows; and for others who will follow they radiate the splendour of their lives as beacon-fires on some high watch-tower. We have indeed a mark to guide us safely over the ocean of temptations; and why make the too curious inquiry, whether some with such thoughts as these have not fallen nevertheless, and why therefore despair, as if the achievement was beyond your reach? Look on him who has succeeded, and boldly launch upon the voyage with confidence that it will be prosperous, and sail on under the breeze of the Holy Spirit with Christ your pilot and with the oarage of good cheer[fn-29-P2902_1950286:181-nf] . For those who \"go down to the sea in ships and occupy their business in great waters\" do not let the shipwreck that has befallen some one else prevent their being of good cheer; they rather shield their hearts in this very, confidence, and so sweep on to accomplish their successful feat. Surely it is the most absurd thing in the world to reprobate him who has slipped in a course which requires the greatest nicety, while one considers those who all their lives have been growing old in failures and in errors, to have chosen the better part. If one single approach to sin is such an awful thing that you deem it safer not to take in hand at all this loftier aim, how much more awful a thing it is to make sin the practice of a whole life, and to remain thereby absolutely ignorant of the purer course! How can you in your full life obey the Crucified? How can you, hale in sin, obey Him Who died to sin? How can you, who are not crucified to the world, and will not accept the mortification of the flesh, obey Him Who bids you follow after Him, and Who bore the Cross in His own body, as a trophy from the foe? How can you obey Paul when he exhorts you \"to present your body a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God[fn-29-P2903_1951546:182-nf] ,\" when you are \"conformed to this world,\" and not transformed by the renewing of your mind, when you are not \"walking\" in this \"newness of life,\" but still pursuing the routine of \"the old man\"? How can you be a priest unto God[fn-29-P2904_1951820:183-nf] , anointed though you are for this very office, to offer a gift to God; a gift in no way another's, no counterfeited gift from sources outside yourself, but a gift that is really your own, namely, \"the inner man[fn-29-P2905_1952128:184-nf] ,\" who must be perfect and blameless, as it is required of a lamb to be without spot or blemish? How can you offer this to God, when you do not listen to the law forbidding the unclean to offer sacrifices? If you long for God to manifest Himself to you, why do you not hear Moses, when he commands the people to be pure from the stains of marriage, that they may take in the vision of God[fn-29-P2906_1952539:185-nf] If this all seems little in your eyes, to be crucified with Christ, to present yourself a sacrifice to God, to become a priest unto the most high God, to make yourself worthy of the vision of the Almighty, what higher blessings than these can we imagine for you, if indeed you make light of the consequences of these as well? And the consequence of being crucified with Christ is that we shall live with Him, and be glorified with Him, and reign with Him; and the consequence of presenting ourselves to God is that we shall be changed from the rank of human nature and human dignity to that of Angels; for so speaks Daniel, that \"thousand thousands stood before him[fn-29-P2907_1953227:186-nf] .\" He too who has taken his share in the true priesthood and placed himself beside the Great High Priest remains altogether himself a priest for ever, prevented for eternity from remaining any more in death. To say, again, that one makes oneself worthy to see God, produces no less a result than this; that one is made worthy to see God. Indeed, the crown of every hope, and of every desire, of every blessing, and of every promise of God, and of all those unspeakable delights which we believe to exist beyond our perception and our knowledge,-the crowning result of them all, I say, is this. Moses longed earnestly to see it, and many prophets and kings have desired to see the same: but the only class deemed worthy of it are the pure in heart, those who are, and are named \"blessed,\" for this very reason, that \"they shall see God[fn-29-P2908_1954083:187-nf] .\" Wherefore we would that you too should become crucified with Christ, a holy priest standing before God, a pure offering in all chastity, preparing yourself by your own holiness for God's coming; that you also may have a pure heart in which to see God, according to the promise of God, and of our Saviour Jesus Christ, to Whom be gloryfor ever and ever. Amen.

I feel myself growing dizzy with all this, and wonder whether, in obeying you, I have not been obeying God, nor walking in the footsteps of the saints, unless it be that my too great love to you, and my unwillingness to cause you any pain, has led me astray and caused me to think of all these excuses. We started from the words of the preacher, where he says: \"My son, beware of making many books.\" With this I compare a saying from the Proverbs of the same Solomon,[fn-66-P6671_1166477:10-nf] \"In the multitude of words thou shall not escape sin; but in sparing thy lips thou shalt be wise.\" Here I ask whether speaking many words of whatever kind is a multitude of words (in the sense of the preacher), even if the many words a man speaks are sacred and connected with salvation. If this be the case, and if he who makes use of many salutary words is guilty of \"multitude of words,\" then Solomon himself did not escape this sin, for \"he spoke[fn-66-P6672_1166940:11-nf] three thousand proverbs, and five thousand songs, and he spoke of trees from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall, he spoke also of beasts and of fowl, and of creeping things and of fishes.\" How, I may ask, can any one give any course of instruction, without a multitude of words, using the phrase in its simplest sense? Does not Wisdom herself say to those who are perishing,[fn-66-P6673_1167382:12-nf] \"I stretched out my words, and ye heeded not\"? Do we not find Paul, too, extending his discourse from morning to midnight,[fn-66-P6674_1167523:13-nf] when Eutychus was borne down with sleep and fell down, to the dismay of the hearers. who thought he was killed? If, then, the words are true, \"In much speaking thou wilt not escape sin,\" and if Solomon was yet not guilty of great sin when he discoursed on the subjects above mentioned, nor Paul when he prolonged his discourse till midnight, then the question arises, What is that much speaking which is referred to? and then we may pass on to consider what are the many books. Now the entire Word of God, who was in the beginning with God, is not much speaking, is not words; for the Word is one, being composed of the many speculations (theoremata), each of which is a part of the Word in its entirety. Whatever words there be outside of this one, which promise to give any description and exposition, even though they be words about truth, none of these, to put it in a somewhat paradoxical way, is Word or Reason, they are all words or reasons. They are not the monad, far from it; they are not that which agrees and is one in itself, by their inner divisions and conflicts unity has departed from them, they have become numbers, perhaps infinite numbers. We are obliged, therefore, to say that whoever speaks that which is foreign to religion is using many words, while he who speaks the words of truth, even should he go over the whole field and omit nothing, is always speaking the one word. Nor are the saints guilty of much speaking, since they always have the aim in view which is connected with the one word. It appears, then, that the much speaking which is condemned is judged to be so rather from the nature of the views propounded, than from the number of the words pronounced. Let us see if we cannot conclude in the same way that all the sacred books are one book, but that those outside are the \"many books\" of the preacher. The proof of this must be drawn from Holy Scripture, and it will be most satisfactorily established if I am able to show that it is not only one book, taking the word now in its commoner meaning, that we find to be written about Christ. Christ is written about even in the Pentateuch; He is spoken of in each of the Prophets, and in the Psalms, and, in a word, as the Saviour Himself says, in all the Scriptures. He refers us to them all, when He says:[fn-66-P6675_1169838:14-nf] \"Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and these are they which testify of Me.\" And if He refers us to the Scriptures as testifying of Him, it is not to one that He sends us, to the exclusion of another, but to all that speak of Him, those which, in the Psalms, He calls the chapter of the book, saying,[fn-66-P6676_1170187:15-nf] \"In the chapter of the book it is written of Me.\" If any one proposes to take these words, \"In the chapter of the book it is written of Me,\" literally, and to apply them to this or that special passage where Christ is spoken of, let him tell us on what principle he warrants his preference for one book over another. If any one supposes that we are doing something of this kind ourselves. and applying the words in question to the book of Psalms, we deny that we do so, and we would urge that in that case the words should have been, \"In this book it is written of Me.\" But He speaks of all the books as one chapter, thus sum-ruing up in one all that is spoken of Christ for our instruction. In fact the book was seen by John,[fn-66-P6677_1170927:16-nf] \"written within and without, and sealed; and no one could open it to read it, and to loose the seals thereof, but the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, who has the key of David,[fn-66-P6678_1171137:17-nf] he that openeth and none shall shut, and that shutteth and none shall open.\" For the book here spoken of means the whole of Scripture; and it is written within (lit. in front), on account of the meaning which is obvious, and on the back, on account of its remoter and spiritual sense. Observe, in addition to this, if a proof that the sacred writings are one book, and those of an opposite character many. may not be found in the fact that there is one book of the living from which those who have proved unworthy to be in it are blotted out, as it is written:[fn-66-P6679_1171717:18-nf] \"Let them be blotter out of the book of the living,\" while of those who are to undergo the judgment, there are books in the plural, as Daniel says:[fn-66-P6680_1171884:19-nf] \"The judgment was set, and the books were opened.\" But Moses also bears witness to the unity of the sacred book, when he says:[fn-66-P6681_1172030:20-nf] \"If Thou forgive the people their sins, forgive, but if not, then wipe me out of the book which Thou hast written.\" The passage in Isaiah,[fn-66-P6682_1172191:21-nf] too, I read in the same way. It is not peculiar to his prophecy that the words of the book should be sealed, and should neither be read by him who does not know letters, because he is ignorant of letters, nor by him who is learned, because the book is sealed. This is true of every writing, for every written work needs the reason (Logos) which closed it to open it. \"He shall shut, and none shall open,\"[fn-66-P6683_1172615:22-nf] and when He opens no one can cast doubt on the interpretation He brings. Hence it is said that He shall open and no man shall shut. I infer a similar lesson from the book spoken of in Ezekiel,[fn-66-P6684_1172828:23-nf] in which was written lamentation, and a song, and woe. For the whole book is full of the woe of the lost, and the song of the saved, and the lamentation of those between these two. And John, too, when he speaks of his eating the one roll,[fn-66-P6685_1173079:24-nf] in which both front and back were written on, means the whole of Scripture, one book which is, at first, most sweet when one begins, as it were, to chew it, but bitter in the revelation of himself which it makes to the conscience of each one who knows it. I will add to the proof of this an apostolic saying which has been quite misunderstood by the disciples of Marcion, who, therefore, set the Gospels at naught. The Apostle says:[fn-66-P6686_1173533:25-nf] \"According to my Gospel in Christ Jesus; \"he does not speak of Gospels in the plural, and, hence, they argue that as the Apostle only speaks of one Gospel in the singular, there was only one in existence. But they fail to see that, as He is one of whom all the evangelists write, so the Gospel, though written by several hands, is, in effect, one. And, in fact, the Gospel, though written by four, is one. From these considerations, then, we learn what the one book is, and what the many books, and what I am now concerned about is, not the quantity I may write, but the effect of what I say, lest, if I fail in this point, and set forth anything against the truth itself, even in one of my writings, I should prove to have transgressed the commandment, and to be a writer of \"many books.\" Yet I see the heterodox assailing the holy Church of God in these days, under the pretence of higher wisdom, and bringing forward works in many volumes in which they offer expositions of the evangelical and apostolic writings, and I fear that if I should be silent and should not put before our members the saving and true doctrines, these teachers might get a hold of curious souls, which, in the absence of wholesome nourishment, might go after food that is forbidden, and, in fact, unclean and horrible. It appears to me, therefore, to be necessary that one who is able to represent in a genuine manner the doctrine of the Church, and to refute those dealers in knowledge, falsely so-called, should take his stand against historical fictions, and oppose to them the true and lofty evangelical message in which the agreement of the doctrines, found both in the so-called Old Testament and in the so-called New, appears so plainly and fully. You yourself felt at one time the lack of good representatives of the better cause, and were impatient of a faith which was at issue with reason and absurd, and you then, for the love you bore to the Lord, gave yourself to composition from which, however, in the exercise of the judgment with which you are endowed, you afterwards desisted. This is the defence which I think admits of being made for those who have the faculty of speaking and writing. But I am also pleading my own cause, as I now devote myself with what boldness I may to the work of exposition; for it may be that I am not endowed with that habit and disposition which he ought to have who is fitted by God to be a minister of the New Covenant, not of the letter but of the spirit.","title":"From the Fifth Book.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":7,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"42","folder":"ANF-03","text":"The simple, indeed, (I will not call them unwise and unlearned, ) who always constitute the majority of believers, are startled at the dispensation[fn-104-P10411_2916749:25-nf] (of the Three in One), on the ground that their very rule of faith withdraws them from the world's plurality of gods to the one only true God; not understanding that, although He is the one only God, He must yet be believed in with His own oi0konomi/a. The numerical order and distribution of the Trinity they assume to be a division of the Unity; whereas the Unity which derives the Trinity out of its own self is so far from being destroyed, that it is actually supported by it. They are constantly throwing out against us that we are preachers of two gods and three gods, while they take to themselves pre-eminently the credit of being worshippers of the One God; just as if the Unity itself with irrational deductions did not produce heresy, and the Trinity rationally considered constitute the truth. We, say they, maintain the Monarchy (or, sole government of God).[fn-104-P10412_2917639:26-nf] And so, as far as the sound goes, do even Latins (and ignorant ones too) pronounce the word in such a way that you would suppose their understanding of the monarxi/a (or Monarchy) was as complete as their pronunciation of the term. Well, then Latins take pains to pronounce the monarxi/a (or Monarchy), while Greeks actually refuse to understand the oi0konomi/a, or Dispensation (of the Three in One). As for myself, however, if I have gleaned any knowledge of either language, I am sure that monarxi/a (or Monarchy) has no other meaning than single and individual[fn-104-P10413_2918245:27-nf] rule; but for all that, this monarchy does not, because it is the government of one, preclude him whose government it is, either from having a son, or from having made himself actually a son to himself,[fn-104-P10414_2918461:28-nf] or from ministering his own monarchy by whatever agents he will. Nay more, I contend that no dominion so belongs to one only, as his own, or is in such a sense singular, or is in such a sense a monarchy, as not also to be administered through other persons most closely connected with it, and whom it has itself provided as officials to itself. If, moreover, there be a son belonging to him whose monarchy it is, it does not forthwith become divided and cease to be a monarchy, if the son also be taken as a sharer in it; but it is as to its origin equally his, by whom it is communicated to the son; and being his, it is quite as much a monarchy (or sole empire), since it is held together by two who are so inseparable.[fn-104-P10415_2919229:29-nf] Therefore, inasmuch as the Divine Monarchy also is administered by so many legions and hosts of angels, according as it is written, \"Thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him; \"[fn-104-P10416_2919475:30-nf] and since it has not from this circumstance ceased to be the rule of one (so as no longer to be a monarchy), because it is administered by so many thousands of powers; how comes it to pass that God should be thought to suffer division and severance in the Son and in the Holy Ghost, who have the second and the third places assigned to them, and who are so closely joined with the Father in His substance, when He suffers no such (division and severance) in the multitude of so many angels? Do you really suppose that Those, who are naturally members of the Father's own substance, pledges of His love,[fn-104-P10417_2920097:31-nf] instruments of His might, nay, His power itself and the entire system of His monarchy, are the overthrow and destruction thereof? You are not right in so thinking. I prefer your exercising yourself on the meaning of the thing rather than on the sound of the word. Now you must understand the overthrow of a monarchy to be this, when another dominion, which has a framework and a state peculiar to itself (and is therefore a rival), is brought in over and above it: when, e.g., some other god is introduced in opposition to the Creator, as in the opinions of Marcion; or when many gods are introduced, according to your Valentinuses and your Prodicuses. Then it amounts to an overthrow of the Monarchy, since it involves the destruction of the Creator.[fn-104-P10418_2920913:32-nf] ","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":7,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_46_the_first_apology_of_justin","source_chapter":53,"source_paragraph":"176","folder":"ANF-01","text":"And that the Spirit of prophecy might signify to us that He who suffers these things has an ineffable origin, and rules His enemies, He spake thus: \"His generation who shall declare? because His life is cut off from the earth: for their transgressions He comes to death.

Because, when\nDaniel saw the vision of the four beasts, he saw first the children of Ham, the seed of Nimrod, which\nthe Babylonians are; and secondly, the Persians and Medes, who are the children of Japhet; and\nthirdly, the Greeks, the brethren of the Medes; and fourthly, the children of Shem, which the\nchildren of Esau are. For a confederacy was formed between the children of Japhet and the children of\nShem. Then the government was taken away from the children of Japhet, the younger, and was given to\nShem, the elder; and to this day it continues, and will continue for ever. But when the time of the\nconsummation of the dominion of the children of Shem shall have come, the Ruler, who came forth from\nthe children of Judah, shall receive the kingdom, when He shall come in His second Advent.","title":"Letter of an Inquirer.","author":"Aphrahat"},{"chapter":7,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_38_letter_of_an_inquirer_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"41","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"§15.

For lo! every covenant of God is freed from the burden of kings\nand princes.[fn-41-P4151_1379202:90-nf] For even if a man has\nserved the heathen, as soon as ever he draws nigh unto the covenant of God, he is set free.

And\nlo! the children of the Kingdom are sealed, and they have received their emancipation from this\nworld. For since it exists now, it will not be willing to be subjected to the power of the King, Who\nshall come and take to Himself His Kingdom.

For when He, Whose\nis the Kingdom,[fn-41-P4153_1380168:92-nf] shall come in His\nsecond coming, He will take to Himself whatever He has given. And He Himself will be King for ever\nand ever.

The divine word says that our God is \"a consuming fire,\"[fn-90-P9064_2329391:47-nf] and that \"He draws rivers of fire before Him; \"[fn-90-P9065_2329469:48-nf] nay, that He even entereth in as \"a refiner's fire, and as a fuller's herb,\"[fn-90-P9066_2329569:49-nf] to purify His own people.

And we assert that they are wickedness, and the works which result from it, and which, being figuratively called \"wood, hay, stubble,\"[fn-90-P9067_2329874:50-nf] God consumes as a fire. The wicked man, accordingly, is said to build up on the previously-laid foundation of reason, \"wood, and hay, and stubble.\" If, then, any one can show that these words were differently understood by the writer, and can prove that the wicked man literally[fn-90-P9068_2330178:51-nf] builds up \"wood, or hay, or stubble,\" it is evident that the fire must be understood to be material, and an object of sense. But if, on the contrary, the works of the wicked man are spoken of figuratively under the names of \"wood, or hay, or stubble,\" why does it not at once occur (to inquire) in what sense the word \"fire\" is to be taken, so that \"wood\" of such a kind should be consumed? for (the Scripture) says: \"The fire will try each man's work of what sort it is. If any man's work abide. which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.

And, being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks; and in the midst of the candlesticks One like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment reaching to the feet, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle; and His head and His hairs were white, as white as wool, and as snow; and His eyes were as a flame of fire; and His feet like unto fine brass, as if He burned in a furnace. And His voice [was] as the voice of waters; and He had in His right hand seven stars; and out of His mouth went a sharp two-edged sword; and His countenance was as the sun shining in his strength.\"[fn-84-P8416_2357715:304-nf] For in these words He sets forth something of the glory [which He has received] from His Father, as [where He makes mention of] the head; something in reference to the priestly office also, as in the case of the long garment reaching to the feet. And this was the reason why Moses vested the high priest after this fashion. Something also alludes to the end [of all things], as [where He speaks of] the fine brass burning in the fire, which denotes the power of faith, and the continuing instant in prayer, because of the consuming fire which is to come at the end of time. But when John could not endure the sight (for he says, \"I fell at his feet as dead; \"[fn-84-P8417_2358394:305-nf] that what was written might come to pass: \"No man sees God, and shall live\"[fn-84-P8418_2358489:306-nf] ), and the Word reviving him, and reminding him that it was He upon whose bosom he had leaned at supper, when he put the question as to who should betray Him, declared: \"I am the first and the last, and He who liveth, and was dead, and behold I am alive for evermore, and have the keys of death and of hell.\" And after these things, seeing the same Lord in a second vision, he says: \"For I saw in the midst of the throne, and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.\"[fn-84-P8419_2359142:307-nf] And again, he says, speaking of this very same Lamb: \"And behold a white horse; and He that sat upon him was called Faithful and True; and in righteousness doth He judge and make war. And His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns; having a name written, that no man knoweth but Himself: and He was girded around with a vesture sprinkled with blood: and His name is called The Word of God.

If, then, neither Moses, nor Elias, nor Ezekiel, who had all many celestial visions, did see God; but if what they did see were similitudes of the splendour of the Lord, And prophecies of things to come; it is manifest that the Father is indeed invisible, of whom also the Lord said, \"No man hath seen God at any time.\"[fn-84-P8411_2355272:299-nf] But His Word, as He Himself willed it, and for the benefit of those who beheld, did show the Father's brightness, and explained His purposes (as also the Lord said: \"The only-begotten God,[fn-84-P8412_2355480:300-nf] which is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared [Him]; \"and He does Himself also interpret the Word of the Father as being rich and great); not in one figure, nor in one character, did He appear to those seeing Him, but according to the reasons and effects aimed at in His dispensations, as it is written in Daniel. For at one time He was seen with those who were around Ananias, Azarias, Misael, as present with them in the furnace of fire, in the burning, and preserving them from [the effects of] fire: \"And the appearance of the fourth,\" it is said, \"was like to the Son of God.\"[fn-84-P8413_2356410:301-nf] At another time [He is represented as] \"a stone cut out of the mountain without hands,\"[fn-84-P8414_2356519:302-nf] and as smiting all temporal kingdoms, and as blowing them away (ventilans ea), and as Himself filling all the earth. Then, too, is this same individual beheld as the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven, and drawing near to the Ancient of Days, and receiving from Him all power and glory, and a kingdom. \"His dominion,\" it is said, \"is an everlasting dominion, and His kingdom shall not perish.\"[fn-84-P8415_2356945:303-nf] John also, the Lord's disciple, when beholding the sacerdotal and glorious advent of His kingdom, says in the Apocalypse: \"I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And, being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks; and in the midst of the candlesticks One like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment reaching to the feet, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle; and His head and His hairs were white, as white as wool, and as snow; and His eyes were as a flame of fire; and His feet like unto fine brass, as if He burned in a furnace. And His voice [was] as the voice of waters; and He had in His right hand seven stars; and out of His mouth went a sharp two-edged sword; and His countenance was as the sun shining in his strength.\"[fn-84-P8416_2357715:304-nf] For in these words He sets forth something of the glory [which He has received] from His Father, as [where He makes mention of] the head; something in reference to the priestly office also, as in the case of the long garment reaching to the feet. And this was the reason why Moses vested the high priest after this fashion. Something also alludes to the end [of all things], as [where He speaks of] the fine brass burning in the fire, which denotes the power of faith, and the continuing instant in prayer, because of the consuming fire which is to come at the end of time. But when John could not endure the sight (for he says, \"I fell at his feet as dead; \"[fn-84-P8417_2358394:305-nf] that what was written might come to pass: \"No man sees God, and shall live\"[fn-84-P8418_2358489:306-nf] ), and the Word reviving him, and reminding him that it was He upon whose bosom he had leaned at supper, when he put the question as to who should betray Him, declared: \"I am the first and the last, and He who liveth, and was dead, and behold I am alive for evermore, and have the keys of death and of hell.\" And after these things, seeing the same Lord in a second vision, he says: \"For I saw in the midst of the throne, and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.\"[fn-84-P8419_2359142:307-nf] And again, he says, speaking of this very same Lamb: \"And behold a white horse; and He that sat upon him was called Faithful and True; and in righteousness doth He judge and make war. And His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns; having a name written, that no man knoweth but Himself: and He was girded around with a vesture sprinkled with blood: and His name is called The Word of God.

And if, again, they choose to allege the fact that Philip inquired about the Father, saying, \"Show us the Father, and it sufficeth us,\" to whom the Lord made answer in these terms: \"Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.

He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.\" By which He means, If thou hast seen me, thou mayest know the Father through me.

Shall he turn away and not return?\"[fn-32-P3293_1078718:36-nf] Why did the virgin turn shamefully away, though she bad heard Christ her bridegroom saying through the mouth of Jeremiah, \"And I said, after she had done all these things (committed all these fornications, LXX.), turn thou unto me, but she returned not?\"[fn-32-P3294_1078992:37-nf] \"Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? Why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?\"[fn-32-P3295_1079136:38-nf] You might indeed find many remedies for evil in Scripture, many medicines to save from destruction and lead to health; the mysteries of death and resurrection, the sentences of terrible judgment and everlasting punishment; the doctrines of repentance and of remission of sins; all the countless illustrations of conversion, the piece of money, the sheep, the son who wasted his substance with harlots, who was lost and was found, who was dead and alive again. Let us not use these remedies for ill; by these means let us heal our soul. Bethink you of your last day, for you will surely not, unlike all other women, live for ever. The distress, the gasping for breath, the hour of death, the imminent sentence of God, the angels hastening on their way, the soul fearfully dismayed, and lashed to agony by the consciousness of sin, turning itself piteously to things of this life and to the inevitable necessity of that long life to be lived elsewhere. Picture to me, as it rises in your imagination, the conclusion of all human life, when the Son of God shall come in His glory with His angels, \"For he shall come anti shall not keep silence;\"[fn-32-P3296_1080299:39-nf] when He shall come to judge the quick and dead, to render to every one according to his work; when that terrible trumpet with its mighty voice shall wake those that have slept through the ages, and they that have done good shall come forth unto the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation.[fn-32-P3297_1080650:40-nf] Remember the vision of Daniel, and bow he brings the judgment before us: \"I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of His head likethe pure wool; ... and His wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth before Him; thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened,\"[fn-32-P3298_1081126:41-nf] clearly disclosing in the hearing of all, angels and men, things good and evil, things done openly and in secret, deeds, words, and thoughts all at once. What then must those men be who have lived wicked lives? Where then shall that soul hide which in the sight of all these spectators shall suddenly be revealed in its fulness of shame? With what kind of body shall it sustain those endless and unbearable pangs in the place of fire unquenched, and of the worm that perishes and never dies, and of depth of Hades, dark and horrible; bitter wailings, loud lamenting, weeping and gnashing of teeth and anguish without end? From all these woes there is no release after death; no device, no means of coming forth from the chastisement of pain.","title":"Letter XLVI","author":"St. Basil"}]
