And he slew the false priests, as the corrupters and deceivers of men, and not the worshippers of the Deity. Wherefore youth is not to be despised when it is devoted to God. But he is to be despised who is of a wicked mind, although he be old, and full of wicked days.[fn-14-P1441_254988:22-nf] Timothy the Christ-bearer was young, but hear what his teacher writes to him: \"Let no man despise thy youth, but be thou an example of the believers in word and in conduct.\"[fn-14-P1442_255190:23-nf] It is becoming, therefore, that ye also should be obedient to your bishop, and contradict him in nothing; for it is a fearful thing to contradict any such person. For no one does [by such conduct] deceive him that is visible, but does [in reality] seek to mock Him that is invisible, who, however, cannot be mocked by any one. And every such act has respect not to man, but to God. For God says to Samuel, \"They have not mocked thee, but Me.\"[fn-14-P1443_255653:24-nf] And Moses declares, \"For their murmuring is not against us, but against the Lord God.\"[fn-14-P1444_255761:25-nf] No one of those has, [in fact, ] remained unpunished, who rose up against their superiors. For Dathan and Abiram did not speak against the law, but against Moses,[fn-14-P1445_255941:26-nf] and were cast down alive into Hades. Korah also,[fn-14-P1446_256008:27-nf] and the two hundred and fifty who conspired with him against Aaron, were destroyed by fire. Absalom, again,[fn-14-P1447_256135:28-nf] who had slain his brother, became suspended on a tree, and had his evil-designing heart thrust through with darts. In like manner was Abeddadan[fn-14-P1448_256302:29-nf] beheaded for the same reason. Uzziah,[fn-14-P1449_256402:30-nf] when he presumed to oppose the priests and the priesthood, was smitten with leprosy. Saul also was dishonoured,[fn-14-P1450_256538:31-nf] because he did not wait for Samuel the high priest. It behoves you, therefore, also to reverence your superiors.","title":"The Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians","author":"Ignatius"},{"chapter":13,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_41_tractate_xxxvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"14","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"12. Let it not by any means surprise any one that He says, \"My judgment is true; because I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me;\" whilst He has said in another place, \"The Father judgeth not any man, but all judgment hath He given to the Son.\" We have already discoursed on these same words of the evangelist, and we remind you now that this was not said because the Father will not be with the Son when He comes to judge, but because the Son alone will be apparent to the good and the bad in the judgment, in that form in which He suffered, and rose again, and ascended into heaven. For at that moment, indeed, as they were beholding Him ascending, the angelic voice sounded in the ears of His disciples, \"So shah He come in like manner as ye have seen Him going into heaven;\"[fn-15-P1598_1016295:12-nf] that is, in the form of man in which He was judged, will He judge, in order that also that prophetic utterance may be fulfilled, \"They shall look upon Him whom they pierced.\"[fn-15-P1599_1016516:13-nf] But when the righteous go into eternal life, we shall see Him as He is; that will not be the judgment of the living and the dead, but only the reward of the living.","title":"Tractate XXXVI.","author":"Augustine"}]
