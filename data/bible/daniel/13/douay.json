{"verses":["Now there was a man that dwelt in Babylon, and his name was\nJoakim:","And he took a wife, whose name was Susanna, the daughter of\nHelcias, a very beautiful woman, and one that feared God.","For her parents being just, had instructed their daughter\naccording to the law of Moses.","Now Joakim was very rich, and had an orchard near his house:  and\nthe Jews resorted to him, because he was the most honourable of them\nall.","And there were two of the ancients of the people appointed judges\nthat year, of whom the Lord said:  That iniquity came out from Babylon,\nfrom the ancient judges, that seemed to govern the people.","These men frequented the house of Joakim, and all that hand any\nmatters of judgment came to them.","And when the people departed away at noon, Susanna went in, and\nwalked in her husband's orchard.","And the old men saw her going in every day, and walking:  and they\nwere inflamed with lust towards her:","And they perverted their own mind, and turned away their eyes,\nthat they might not look unto heaven, nor remember just judgments.","So they were both wounded with the love of her, yet they did not\nmake known their grief one to the other.","For they were ashamed to declare to one another their lust,\nbeing desirous to have to do with her:","And they watched carefully every day to see her.  And one said to\nthe other:","Let us now go home, for it is dinner time.  So going out, they\ndeparted one from another.","And turning back again, they came both to the same place:  and\nasking one another the cause, they acknowledged their lust:  and then\nthey agreed together upon a time, when they might find her alone.","And it fell out, as they watched a fit day, she went in on a\ntime, as yesterday and the day before, with two maids only, and was\ndesirous to wash herself in the orchard:  for it was hot weather.","And there was nobody there, but the two old men that had hid\nthemselves, and were beholding her.","So she said to the maids:  Bring me oil, and washing balls, and\nshut the doors of the orchard, that I may wash me.","And they did as she bade them:  and they shut the doors of the\norchard, and went out by a back door to fetch what she had commanded\nthem, and they knew not that the elders were hid within.","Now when the maids were gone forth, the two elders arose, and\nran to her, and said:","Behold the doors of the orchard are shut, and nobody seeth us,\nand we are in love with thee:  wherefore consent to us, and lie with us.","But if thou wilt not, we will bear witness against thee, that a\nyoung man was with thee, and therefore thou didst send away thy maids\nform thee.","Susanna sighed, and said:  I am straitened on every side:  for if\nI do this thing, it is death to me:  and if I do it not, I shall not\nescape your hands.","But it is better for me to fall into your hands without doing\nit, than to sin in the sight of the Lord.","With that Susanna cried out with a loud voice:  and the elders\nalso cried out against her.","And one of them ran to the door of the orchard, and opened it.","So when the servants of the house heard the cry in the orchard,\nthey rushed in by the back door, to see what was the matter.","But after the old men had spoken, the servants were greatly\nashamed:  for never had there been any such word said of Susanna.  And on\nthe next day,","When the people were come to Joakim, her husband, the two elders\nalso came full of wicked device against Susanna, to put her to death.","And they said before the people:  Send to Susanna, daughter of\nHelcias, the wife of Joakim.  And presently they sent.","And she came with her parents, and children and all her kindred.","Now Susanna was exceeding delicate, and beautiful to behold.","But those wicked men commanded that her face should be\nuncovered, (for she was covered) that so at least they might be\nsatisfied with her beauty.","Therefore her friends, and all her acquaintance wept.","But the two elders rising up in the midst of the people, laid\ntheir hands upon her head.","And she weeping, looked up to heaven, for her heart had\nconfidence in the Lord.","And the elders said:  As we walked in the orchard alone, this\nwoman came in with two maids, and shut the doors of the orchard, ans\nsent away the maids from her.","Then a young man that was there hid came to her, and lay with\nher.","But we that were in a corner of the orchard, seeing this\nwickedness, ran up to them, and we saw them lie together.","And him indeed we could not take, because he was stronger than\nus, and opening the doors, he leaped out:","But having taken this woman, we asked who the young man was, but\nshe would not tell us:  of this thing we are witnesses.","The multitude believed them, as being the elders, and the judges\nof the people, and they condemned her to death.","Then Susanna cried out with a loud voice, and said:  O eternal\nGod, who knowest hidden things, who knowest all things before they come\nto pass,","Thou knowest that they have borne false witness against me:  and\nbehold I must die, whereas I have done none of these things, which\nthese men have maliciously forged against me.","And the Lord heard her voice.","And when she was led to be put to death, the Lord raised up the\nholy spirit of a young boy, whose name was Daniel:","And he cried out with a loud voice:  I am clear from the blood of\nthis woman.","Then all the people turning themselves towards him, said:  What\nmeaneth this word that thou hast spoken?","But he standing in the midst of them, said:  Are ye so foolish,\nye children of Israel, that without examination or knowledge of the\ntruth, you have condemned a daughter of Israel?","Return to judgment, for they have borne false witness against\nher.","So all the people turned again in haste, and the old men said to\nhim:  Come, and sit thou down among us, and shew it us:  seeing God hath\ngiven thee the honour of old age.","And Daniel said to the people:  Separate these two far from one\nanother, and I will examine them.","So when they were put asunder one from the other, he called one\nof them, and said to him:  O thou that art grown old in evil days, now\nare thy sins come out, which thou hast committed before:","In judging unjust judgments, oppressing the innocent, and\nletting the guilty to go free, whereas the Lord saith:  The innocent and\nthe just thou shalt not kill.","Now then if thou sawest her, tell me under what tree thou sawest\nthem conversing together:  He said:  Under a mastic tree.","And Daniel said:  Well hast thou lied against thy own head:  for\nbehold the angel of God having received the sentence of him, shall cut\nthee in two.","And having put him aside, he commanded that the other should\ncome, and he said to him:  O thou seed of Chanaan, and not of Juda,\nbeauty hath deceived tee, and lust hath perverted thy heart:","Thus did you do to the daughters of Israel, and they for fear\nconversed with you:  but a daughter of Juda would not abide your\nwickedness.","Now, therefore, tell me, under what tree didst thou take them\nconversing together.  And he answered:  Under a holm tree.","And Daniel said to him:  Well hast thou also lied against thy own\nhead:  for the angel of the Lord waiteth with a sword to cut thee in\ntwo, and to destroy you.","With that all the assembly cried out with a loud voice, and they\nblessed God, who saveth them that trust in him.","And they rose up against the two elders, (for Daniel had\nconvicted them of false witness by their own mouth) and they did to\nthem as they had maliciously dealt against their neighbour,","To fulfil the law of Moses:  and they put them to death, and\ninnocent blood was saved in that day.","But Helcias, and his wife, praised God, for their daughter,\nSusanna, with Joakim, her husband, and all her kindred, because there\nwas no dishonesty found in her.","And Daniel became great in the sight of the people from that\nday, and thence forward.","And king Astyages was gathered to his fathers; and Cyrus, the\nPersian, received his kingdom."]}
