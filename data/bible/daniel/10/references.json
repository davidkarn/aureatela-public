Moreover, from the things created at the beginning may be learnt the fellowship of the Spirit with the Father and the Son. The pure, intelligent, and supermundane powers are and are styled holy, because they have their holiness of the grace given by the Holy Spirit. Accordingly the mode of the creation of the heavenly powers is passed over in Silence, for the historian of the cosmogony has revealed to us only the creation of things perceptible by sense. But do thou, who hast power from the things that are seen to form an analogy of the unseen, glorify the Maker by whom all things were made, visible and invisible, principalities and powers, authorities, thrones, and dominions, and all other reasonable natures whom we cannot name.[fn-15-P1559_383788:327-nf] And in the creation bethink thee first, I pray thee, of the original cause of all things that are made, the Father; of the creative cause, the Son; of the perfecting cause, the Spirit; so that the ministering spirits subsist by the will of the Father, are brought into being by the operation of the Son, and perfected by the presence of the Spirit. Moreover, the perfection of angels is sanctification and continuance in it. And let no one imagine me either to affirm that there are three original hypostases[fn-15-P1560_384325:328-nf] or to allege the operation of the Son to be imperfect. For the first principle of existing things is One, creating through the Son and perfecting through the Spirit.[fn-15-P1561_384514:329-nf] The operation of the Father who worketh all in all is not imperfect, neither is the creating work of the Son incomplete if not perfected by the Spirit. The Father, who creates by His sole will, could not stand in any need of the Son, but nevertheless He wills through the Son; nor could the Son, who works according to the likeness of the Father, need co-operation, but the Son too wills to make perfect through the Spirit. \"For by the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath [the Spirit] of His mouth.\"[fn-15-P1562_385080:330-nf] The Word then is not a mere significant impression on the air, borne by the organs of speech; nor is the Spirit of His mouth a vapour, emitted by the organs of respiration; but the Word is He who \"was with God in the beginning\" and \"was God,\"[fn-15-P1563_385462:331-nf] and the Spirit of the mouth of God is \"the Spirit of truth which proceedeth from the Father.\"[fn-15-P1564_385668:332-nf] You are therefore to perceive three, the Lord who gives the order, the Word who creates,and the Spirit who confirms.[fn-15-P1565_385807:333-nf] And what other thing could confirmation be than the perfecting according to holiness? This perfectingexpresses the confirmation's firmness,unchangeableness,and fixity in good. But there is no sanctification without the Spirit. The powers of the heavens are not holy by nature; were it so there would in this respect be no difference between them and the Holy Spirit. It is in proportion to their relative excellence that they have their meed of holiness from the Spirit. The branding-iron is conceived of together with the fire; and yet the material and the fire are distinct. Thus too in the case of the heavenly powers; their substance is, peradventure, an aerial spirit, or an immaterial fire, as it is written, \"Who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire;\"[fn-15-P1566_386607:334-nf] wherefore they exist in space and become visible, and appear in their proper bodily form to them that are worthy. But their sanctification, being external to their substance, superinduces their perfection through the communion of the Spirit. They keep their rank by their abiding in the good and true, and while they retain their freedom of will, never fall away from their patient attendance on Him who is truly good. It results that, if by your argument you do away with the Spirit, the hosts of the angels are disbanded, the dominions of archangels are destroyed, all is thrown into confusion, and their life loses law, order, and distinctness. For how are angels to cry \"Glory to God in the highest\"[fn-15-P1567_387331:335-nf] without being empowered by the Spirit? For \"No man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost, and no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed;\"[fn-15-P1568_387931:336-nf] as might be said by wicked and hostile spirits, whose fall establishes our statement of the freedom of the will of the invisible powers; being, as they are, in a condition of equipoise between virtue and vice, and on this account needing the succour of the Spirit. I indeed maintain that even Gabriel[fn-15-P1569_388251:337-nf] in no other way foretells events to come than by the foreknowledge of the Spirit, by reason of the fact that one of the boons distributed by the Spirit is prophecy. And whence did he who was ordained to announce the mysteries of the vision to the Man of Desires[fn-15-P1570_388533:338-nf] derive the wisdom whereby he was enabled to teach hidden things, if not from the Holy Spirit? The revelation of mysteries is indeed the peculiar function of the Spirit, as it is written, \"God hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit.\"[fn-15-P1571_388790:339-nf] And how could \"thrones, dominions, principalities and powers\"[fn-15-P1572_388871:340-nf] live their blessed life, did they not \"behold the face of the Father which is in heaven\"?[fn-15-P1573_389017:341-nf] But to behold it is impossible without the Spirit! Just as at night, if you withdraw the light from the house, the eyes fall blind and their faculties become inactive, and the worth of objects cannot be discerned, and gold is trodden on in ignorance as though it were iron, so in the order of the intellectual world it is impossible for the high life of Law to abide without the Spirit. For it so to abide were as likely as that an army should maintain its discipline in the absence of its commander, or a chorus its harmony without the guidance of the coryphaeus. How could the Seraphim cry\"Holy, Holy, Holy,\"[fn-15-P1574_389650:342-nf] were they not taught by the Spirit how often true religion requires them to lift their voice in this ascription of glory? Do \"all His angels\" and \"all His hosts\"[fn-15-P1575_389831:343-nf] praise God? It is through the co-operation of the Spirit. Do \"thousand thousand\" of angels stand before Him, and\"ten thousand times ten thouSand\" ministering spirits?[fn-15-P1576_390022:344-nf] They are blamelessly doing their proper work by the power of the Spirit. All the glorious and unspeakable harmony[fn-15-P1577_390154:345-nf] of the highest heavens both in the service of God, and in the mutual concord of the celestial powers, can therefore only be preserved by the direction of the Spirit. Thus with those beings who are not gradually perfected by increase and advance,[fn-15-P1578_390423:346-nf] butare perfect from the moment of the creation, there is in creation the presence of the Holy Spirit, who confers on them the grace that flows from Him for the completion and perfection of their essence.[fn-15-P1579_390648:347-nf] ","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":10,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_08_counter_statements_of_theodoret_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Against I.-But all we who follow the words of the evangelists state that God the Word was not made flesh by nature, nor yet was changed into flesh; for the Divine is immutable and invariable. Wherefore also the prophet David says, \"Thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.\"[fn-8-P862_140100:174-nf] And this the great Paul, the herald of the truth, in his Epistle to the Hebrews, states to have been spoken of the Son.[fn-8-P863_140270:175-nf] And in another place God says through the Prophet, \"I am the Lord: I change not.\"[fn-8-P864_140515:176-nf] If then the Divine is immutable and invariable, it is incapable of change or alteration. And if the immutable cannot be changed, then God the Word was not made flesh by mutation, but took flesh and tabernacled in us, according to the word of the evangelist. This the divine Paul expresses clearly in his Epistle to the Philippians in the words, \"Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus: who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made Himself of no reputation and took upon Him the form of a servant.\"[fn-8-P865_141138:177-nf] Now it is plain from these words that the form of God was not changed into the form of a servant, but, remaining what it was, took the form of the servant. So God the Word was not made flesh, but assumed living and reasonable flesh. He Himself is not naturally conceived of the Virgin, fashioned, formed, and deriving beginning of existence from her; He who is before the ages, God, and with God, being with the Father and with the Father both known and worshipped; but He fashioned for Himself a temple in the Virgin's womb, and was with that which was formed and begotten. Wherefore also we style that holy Virgin qeotokoj, not because she gave birth in natural manner to God, but to man united to the God that had fashioned Him. Moreover if He that was fashioned in the Virgin's womb was not man but God the Word Who is before the ages, then God the Word is a creature of the Holy Ghost. For that which was conceived in her, says Gabriel, is of the Holy Ghost.[fn-8-P866_142121:178-nf] But if the only begotten Word of God is uncreate and of one substance and co-eternal with the Father it is no longer a formation or creation of the Spirit. And if the Holy Ghost did not fashion God the Word in the Virgin's womb, it follows that we understand the form of the servant to have been fashioned, formed, conceived, and generated. But since the form was not stripped of the form of God, but was a Temple containing God the Word dwelling in it, according to the words of Paul \"For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell\" \"bodily,\"[fn-8-P867_142703:179-nf] we call the Virgin not mother of man (anqrwpotokoj) but mother of God (qeotokoj), applying the former title to the fashioning and conception, but the latter to the union. For this cause the child who was born is called Emmanuel, neither God separated from human nature nor man stripped of Godhead. For Emmanuel is interpreted to mean \"God with us\", according to the words of the Gospels; and the expression \"God with us\" at once manifests Him Who for our sakes was assumed out of us, and proclaims God the Word Who assumed. Therefore the child is called Emmanuel on account of God Who assumed, and the Virgin qeotokoj on account of the union of the form of God with the conceived form of a servant. For God the Word was not changed into flesh, but the form of God took the form of a servant.","title":"Counter-Statements of Theodoret.","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":10,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_09_npnf1_09_13_letter_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF1-09","text":"14. I know that thou art now admiring the grace of Hermione, and thou judgest that there is nothing in the world to be compared to her comeliness; but if you choose, O friend, you shall yourself exceed her in comeliness and gracefulness, as much as golden statues surpass those which are made of clay. For if beauty, when occurs in the body, so fascinates and excites the minds of most men, when the soul is refulgent with it what can match beauty and grace of this kind? For the groundwork of this corporeal beauty is nothing else but phlegm, and blood, and humor, and bile, and the fluid of masticated food. For by these things both eyes and cheeks, and all the other features, are supplied with moisture; and if they do not receive that moisture, daily skin becoming unduly withered, and the eyes sunken, the whole grace of the countenance forthwith vanishes; so that if you consider what is stored up inside those beautiful eyes, and that straight nose, and the mouth and the cheeks, you will affirm the well-shaped body to be nothing else than a whited sepulchre; the parts within are full of so much uncleanness. Morever when you see a rag with any of these things on it, such as phlegm, or spittle you cannot bear to touch it with even the tips of your fingers, nay you cannot even endure looking at it; and yet are you in a flutter of excitement about the storehouses and depositories of these things? But thy beauty was not of this kind, but excelled it as heaven is superior to earth; or rather it was much better and more brilliant than this For no one has anywhere seen a soul by itself, stripped of the body; but yet even so I will endeavour to present to you the beauty of this soul from another source. I mean from the case of the greater powers Hear at least how the beauty of these struck the man greatly beloved; for wishing to set forth their beauty and being unable to find a body of the same character, he had recourse to metallic substances, and he was not satisfied even with these, but took the brilliancy of lightning for his illustration.[fn-6-P677_397209:57-nf] Now if those powers, even when they did not disclose their essential nature pure and bare, but only in a very dim and shadowy way, nevertheless shone so brightly, what must naturally be their appearance, when set free froth every veil? Now we ought to form some such image of the beauty of the soul. \"For they shall be,\" we read \"equal unto the angels.\"[fn-6-P678_397582:58-nf] Now in the case of bodies the fighter and finer kinds, and those which have retreated to the path which tend towards the incorporeal, are very much better and more wonderful than the others. The sky at least is more beautiful than the earth, and fire than water, and the stars than precious stones; and we admire the rainbow far more than violets and roses, and all other flowers which are upon the earth. And in short if it were possible with the bodily eyes to behold the beauty of the soul you would laugh to scorn these corporeal illustrations, so feebly have they presented to us the gracefulness of the soul. Let us not then neglect such a possession, nor such great happiness, and especially when the approach to that kind of beauty becomes easy to us by our hopes of the things to come. \"For our light affliction?\" we read, \"which is but for the moment, worketh for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory, while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.\"[fn-6-P679_398709:59-nf] Now if the blessed Paul called such afflictions as thou wottest of light and easy, because he did not look at the things which are seen, much more tolerable is it merely to cease from wantonness. For we are not calling thee to those dangers which he underwent, nor to those deaths which he incurred daily,[fn-6-P680_399037:60-nf] the constant beatings and scourgings, the bonds, the enmity of the whole world, the hatred of his own people, the frequent vigils, the long journies, the shipwrecks, the attacks of robbers, the plots of his own kinsfolk, the distresses on account of his friends, the hunger, the cold, the nakedness, the burning, the despondency on account both of those who belonged to him, and those who did not belong to him. None of these things do we now demand of thee; all that we ask for is that you would release yourself from your accursed bondage, and return to your former freedom, having considered both the punishment arising from your wantonness, and the honor belonging to your former manner of life. For that unbelievers should be but languidly affected by the thought of the resurrection and never be in fear of this kind, is nothing wonderful; but that we who are more firmly persuaded concerning the things of the other world than those of the present, should spend our life in this miserable and deplorable way and be nowise affected by the memory of those things, but sink into a state of extreme insensibility-this is irrational in the highest degree. For when we who believe do the deeds of unbelievers, or rather are in a more miserable plight than they (for there are some among them who have been eminent for the virtue of their life), what consolation, what excuse will be left for us? And many merchants indeed who have incurred shipwreck have not given way, but have pursued the same journey, and this when the loss which has befallen them was not owing to their own carelessness, but to the force of the winds; and shall we who have reason to be confident concerning the end, and know certainly that if we do not wish it, neither shipwreck nor accident of any kind will bring us damage, not lay hold of the work again, and carry on our business as we did aforetime, but lie in idleness and keep our hands to ourselves? And would that we kept them merely to ourselves and did not use them against ourselves which is a token of stark madness. For if any pugilist, leaving his antagonist were to turn his hands against his own head, and deal blows to his own face, should we not, I ask, rank him among madmen? For the devil has upset us and cast us down; therefore we ought to get up, and not to be dragged down again and precipitate ourselves, and add blows dealt by ourselves to the blows dealt by him. For the blessed David also had a fall like that which has now happened to you; and not this only but another also which followed it. I mean that of murder. What then? did he remain prostrate? Did he not immediately rise up again with energy and place himself in portion to fight the enemy? In fact he wrestled with him so bravely, that even after his death he was the protector of his offspring. For when Solomon had perpetrated great inquity, and had deserved countless deaths, God said that He would leave him the kingdom intact, thus speaking \"I will surely rend the kingdom out of thine hand and will give it to thy servant. Nevertheless I will not do this in thy days.\" Wherefore? \"For David thy father's sake, I will take it out of the hand of thy son.\"[fn-6-P681_402256:61-nf] And again when Hezekiah was about to run the greatest possible risk, although he was a righteous man, God said that He would succour him for the sake of this saint. \"For I will cast my shield\" He saith, \"over this city to save it for my own sake, and for my servant: David's sake.\"[fn-6-P682_402560:62-nf] So great is the force of repentance. But if he had determined with himself, as you do now, that henceforth it was impossible to propitiate God, and if he had said within himself: \"God has honoured me with great honour, and has given me a place among among the prophets, and has entrusted me with the government of my countrymen, and rescued me out of countless perils, how then, whenhave offended against Him after such great benefits, and have perpetrated the worst crimes, shall I be able to recover his favour?\" If he had thought thus, not only would he not have done the things which he afterwards his former evils.","title":"Letter I.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":10,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_21_viii_on_fasting_in_opposition_to_the_psychics_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"47","folder":"ANF-04","text":"This principal species in the category of dietary restriction may already afford a prejudgment concerning the inferior operations of abstinence also, as being themselves too, in proportion to their measure, useful or necessary.

I return to Daniel and his brethren, preferring as they did a diet of vegetables and the beverage of water to the royal dishes and decanters, and being found as they were therefore \"more handsome\" (lest any be apprehensive on the score of his paltry body, to boot!), sides being spiritually cultured into the bargain.[fn-18-P1803_527474:67-nf] For God gave to the young men knowledge and understanding in every kind of literature, and to Daniel in every word, and in dreams, and in every kind of wisdom; which (wisdom) was to make him wise in this very thing also,-namely, by what means the recognition of mysteries was to be obtained from God. Finally, in the third year of Cyrus king of the Persians, when he had fallen into careful and repeated meditation on a vision, he provided another form of humiliation. \"In those days,\" he says, \"I Daniel was mourning during three weeks: pleasant bread I ate not; flesh and wine entered not into my mouth; with oil I was not anointed; until three weeks were consummated: \"which being elapsed, an angel was sent out (from God), addressing him on this wise: \"Daniel, thou art a man pitiable; fear not: since, from the first day on which thou gavest thy soul to recogitation and to humiliation before God, thy word hath been heard, and I am entered at thy word.\"[fn-18-P1804_528447:68-nf] Thus the \"pitiable\" spectacle and the humiliation of xerophagies expel fear, and attract the ears of God, and make men masters of secrets.","title":"VIII.

As to the seasons of the year, dreams are calmer in spring, since summer relaxes, and winter somehow hardens, the soul; while autumn, which in other respects is trying to health, is apt to enervate the soul by the lusciousness of its fruits. Then, again, as regards the position of one's body during sleep, one ought not to lie on his back, nor on his right side, nor so as to wrench[fn-29-P2999_1074075:287-nf] his intestines, as if their cavity were reversely stretched: a palpitation of the heart would ensue, or else a pressure on the liver would produce a painful disturbance of the mind. But however this be, I take it that it all amounts to ingenious conjecture rather than certain proof (although the author of the conjecture be no less a man than Plato);[fn-30-P3000_1074450:288-nf] and possibly all may be no other than the result of chance. But, generally speaking, dreams will be under control of a man's will, if they be capable of direction at all; for we must not examine what opinion on the one hand, and superstition on the other, have to prescribe for the treatment of dreams, in the matter of distinguishing and modifying different sorts of food. As for the superstition, we have an instance when fasting is prescribed for such persons as mean to submit to the sleep which is necessary for receiving the oracle, in order that such abstinence may produce the required purity; while we find an instance of the opinion when the disciples of Pythagoras, in order to attain the same end, reject the bean as an aliment which would load the stomach, and produce indigestion. But the three brethren, who were the companions of Daniel, being content with pulse alone, to escape the contamination of the royal dishes,[fn-30-P3001_1075426:289-nf] received from God, besides other wisdom, the gift especially of penetrating and explaining the sense of dreams. For my own part, I hardly know whether fasting would not simply make me dream so profoundly, that I should not be aware whether I had in fact dreamt at all. Well, then, you ask, has not sobriety something to do in this matter? certainly it is as much concerned in this as it is in the entire subject: if it contributes some good service to superstition, much more does it to religion. For even demons require such discipline from their dreamers as a gratification to their divinity, because they know that it is acceptable to God, since Daniel (to quote him again) \"ate no pleasant bread\" for the space of three weeks.[fn-30-P3002_1076178:290-nf] This abstinence, however, he used in order to please God by humiliation, and not for the purpose of producing a sensibility and wisdom for his soul previous to receiving communication by dreams and visions, as if it were not rather to effect such action in an ecstatic state. This sobriety, then, (in which our question arises, ) will have nothing to do with exciting ecstasy, but will rather serve to recommend its being wrought by God.","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":10,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_14_lecture_ix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"1.

It is true that it is not my opinion about him that you have asked for, but that of the holy martyr Pamphilus; and you have requested to have the book which he is said to have written in his defence in Greek translated for you into Latin: nevertheless I do not doubt that there will be some who will think themselves aggrieved if I say anything in his defence even in the words of another man. I beg them to do nothing in the spirit of presumption and of prejudice; and, since we must all stand before the judgment seat of Christ, not to refuse to hear the truth spoken, lest haply they should do wrong through ignorance. Let them consider that to wound the consciences of their weaker brethren by false accusations is to sin against Christ; and therefore let them not lend their ears to the accusers, nor seek an account of another man's faith from a third party, especially when an opportunity is given them for gaining personal and direct knowledge, and the substance and quality of each man's faith is to be known by his own confession. For so the Scripture says:[fn-84-P8446_2067059:2-nf] \"With the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation\": and:[fn-84-P8447_2067184:3-nf] \"By his words shall each man be justified, and by his word shall he be condemned.\" The opinions of Origen in the various parts of Scripture are clearly set forth in the present work: as to the cause of our finding certain places in which he contradicts himself, an explanation will be offered in the short document subjoined.[fn-84-P8448_2067528:4-nf] But as for myself, I hold that which has been handed down to us from the holy fathers, namely, that the Holy Trinity is coeternal, and of a single nature, virtue and substance; that the Son of God in these last times has been made man, has suffered for our transgressions and rose again from the dead in the very flesh in which he suffered, and thereby imparted the hope of the resurrection to the whole race of mankind. When we speak of the resurrection of the flesh, we do so, not with any subterfuges, as is slanderously reported by certain perons; we believe that it is this very flesh in which we are now living which will rise again, not one kind of flesh instead of another, nor another body than the body of this flesh. When we speak of the body rising we do so in the words of the apostle; for he himself made use of this word: and when we speak of the flesh, our confession is that of the Creed. It is an absurd invention of maliciousness to think that the human body is different from the flesh. However, whether we speak of that which is to rise, according to the common faith, as the flesh, or, according to the Apostle, as the body, this we must believe, that according to the clear statement of the Apostle, that which shall rise shall rise in power and in glory; it will rise an incorruptible and a spiritual body: for \"corruption cannot inherit incorruption.\" We must maintain this preëminence of the body, or flesh, which is to be: but, with this proviso, we must hold that the resurrection of the flesh is perfect and entire; we must on the one hand maintain the identity of the flesh, while on the other we must not detract from the dignity and glory of the incorruptible and spiritual body. For so the Scripture speaks. This is what is preached by the reverend Bishop John at Jerusalem; this we with him both confess and hold. If any one either believes or teaches otherwise, or insinuates that we believe differently from the exposition of our faith, let him be anathema. Let this then be taken as a record of our belief by any who desire to know it. Whatever we read and whatever we do is in accordance with this account of our faith; we follow the words of the Apostle,[fn-84-P8449_2069751:5-nf] \"proving all things holding fast that which is good, avoiding every form of evil.\"[fn-84-P8450_2069857:6-nf] \"And as many as walk by this rule, peace be upon them and upon the Israel of God.\"","title":"Translation of Pamphilus' Defence of Origen.","author":"Rufinus"},{"chapter":10,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_33_on_our_lord_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"30","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"27. For I saw a light from heaven that excelled the sun, and its light shone upon me.[fn-37-P3769_1215938:29-nf] So then mighty rays streamed forth without moderation, and were poured upon feeble eyes, which moderate rays refresh. For, lo! the sun also in measure assists the eyes, but beyond measure and out of measure it injures the eyes. And it is not by way of vengeance in wrath that it smites them. For lo! it is the friend of the eyes and beloved of the eyeballs. And this is a marvel; while with its gentle lustre it befriends and assists the eyes; yet by its vehement rays itis hostile to and injures the eyeballs. But if the sun which is here below, and of kindred nature with the eyes that are here below, yet injures them, in vehemence and not in anger, in its proper force and not in wrath; how much more should the light that is from above, akin to the things that are above, by its vehemence injure a man here below who has suddenly gazed upon that which is not akin to his nature? For since Paul might have been injured by the vehemence of this sun to which he was accustomed, if he gazed upon it not according to custom, how much more should he be injured by the glory of that light to which his eyes never had been accustomed?

Eusebius (or, if you please, Pamphilus) says in that book that the Son is the Servant of the Father, the Holy Spirit is not of the same substance with the Father and the Son; that the souls of men have fallen from heaven; and, inasmuch as we have been changed from the state of Angels, that in the restitution of all things angels and devils and men will all be equal; and many other things so impious and atrocious that it would be a crime even to repeat them. The champion of Origen and translator of Pamphilus is in a strange position.

All of which things the gospel saying, which uses this figure, shows us that we ought also to observe spiritually; first that whatever has found an entrance into our hearts, and whatever doctrine has been received by us, should be most carefully examined to see whether it has been purified by the divine and heavenly fire of the Holy Ghost, or whether it belongs to Jewish superstition, or whether it comes from the pride of a worldly philosophy and only externally makes a show of religion. And this we can do, if we carry out the Apostle's advice, \"Believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits whether they are of God.\"[fn-36-P3616_1344863:64-nf] But by this kind those men also are deceived, who after having been professed as monks are enticed by the grace of style, and certain doctrines of philosophers, which at the first blush, owing to some pious meanings not out of harmony with religion, deceive as with the glitter of gold their hearers, whom they have superficially attracted, but render them poor and miserable for ever, like men deceived by false money made of copper: either bringing them back to the bustle of this world, or enticing them into the errors of heretics, and bombastic conceits: a thing which we read of as happening to Achan in the book of Joshua the son of Nun,[fn-36-P3617_1345527:65-nf] when he coveted a golden weight from the camp of the Philistines, and stole it, and was smitten with a curse and condemned to eternal death. In the second place we should be careful to see that no wrong interpretation fixed on to the pure gold of Scripture deceives us as to the value of the metal: by which means the devil in his craft tried to impose upon our Lord and Saviour as if He was a mere man, when by his malevolent interpretation he perverted what ought to be understood generally of all good men, and tried to fasten it specially on to Him, who had no need of the care of the angels: saying, \"For He shall give His angels charge concerning Thee, to keep Thee in all Thy ways: and in their hands they shall bear Thee up, lest at any time Thou dash Thy foot against a stone,\"[fn-36-P3618_1346334:66-nf] by a skilful assumption on his part giving a turn to the precious sayings of Scripture and twisting them into a dangerous sense, the very opposite of their true meaning, so as to offer to us the image and face of an usurper under cover of the gold colour which may deceive us. Or whether he tries to cheat us with counterfeits, for instance by urging that some work of piety should be taken up which as it does come from the true minds of the fathers, leads under the form of virtue to vice; and, deceiving us either by immoderate or impossible fasts, or by too long vigils, or inordinate prayers, or unsuitable reading, brings us to a bad end. Or, when he persuades us to give ourselves up to mixing in the affairs of others, and to pious visits, by which he may drive us away from the spiritual cloisters of the monastery, and the secrecy of its friendly peacefulness, and suggests that we take on our shoulders the anxieties and cares of religious women who are in want, that when a monk is inextricably entangled in snares of this sort he may distract him with most injurious occupations and cares. Or else when he incites a man to desire the holy office of the clergy under the pretext of edifying many people, and the love of spiritual gain, by which to draw us away from the humility and strictness of our life. All of which things, although they are opposed to our salvation and to our profession, yet when covered with a sort of veil of compassion and religion, easily deceive those who are lacking in skill and care. For they imitate the coins of the true king, because they seem at first full of piety, but are not stamped by those who have the right to coin, i.e., the approved Catholic fathers, nor do they proceed from the head public office for receiving them, but are made by stealth and by the fraud of the devil, and palmed off upon the unskilful and ignorant not without serious harm.

For you have the fruits of an answer pointed out by our Lord's words in the case of the agreement of two persons; as it is said: \"If two of you shall agree upon earth touching anything for which they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.\"[fn-49-P4971_1790561:49-nf] You have another in the fulness of faith, which is compared to a grain of mustard-seed. \"For,\" He says, \"if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain: Be thou removed, and it shall be removed; and nothing shall be impossible to you.\"[fn-49-P4972_1790850:50-nf] You have it in continuance in prayer, which the Lord's words call, by reason of unwearied perseverance in petitioning, importunity: \"For, verily, I say unto you that if not because of his friendship, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as much as he needs.\"[fn-49-P4973_1791154:51-nf] You have it in the fruits of almsgiving: \"Shut up alms in the heart of the poor and it shall pray for thee in the time of tribulation.\"[fn-49-P4974_1791316:52-nf] You have it in the purifying of life and in works of mercy, as it is said: \"Loose the bands of wickedness, undo the bundles that oppress;\" and after a few words in which the barrenness of an unfruitful fast is rebuked, \"then,\" he says, \"thou shall call and the Lord shall hear thee; thou shalt cry, and He shall say, Here am I.\"[fn-49-P4975_1791669:53-nf] Sometimes also excess of trouble causes it to be heard, as it is said: \"When I was in trouble I called unto the Lord, and He heard me;\"[fn-49-P4976_1791838:54-nf] and again: \"Afflict not the stranger for if he crieth unto Me, I will hear him, for I am merciful.\"[fn-49-P4977_1791961:55-nf] You see then in how many ways the gift of an answer may be obtained, so that no one need be crushed by the despair of his conscience for securing those things which are salutary and eternal. For if in contemplating our wretchedness I admit that we are utterly destitute of all those virtues which we mentioned above, and that we have neither that laudable agreement of two persons, nor that faith which is compared to a grain of mustard seed, nor those works of piety which the prophet describes, surely we cannot be without that importunity which He supplies to all who desire it, owing to which alone the Lord promises that He will give whatever He has been prayed to give. And therefore we ought without unbelieving hesitation to persevere, and not to have the least doubt that by continuing in them we shall obtain all those things which we have asked according to the mind of God. For the Lord, in His desire to grant what is heavenly and eternal, urges us to constrain Him as it were by our importunity, as He not only does not despise or reject the importunate, but actually welcomes and praises them, and most graciously promises to grant whatever they have perseveringly hoped for; saying, \"Ask and ye shall receive: seek and ye shall find: knock and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it shall be opened;\"[fn-49-P4978_1793384:56-nf] and again: \"All things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive, and nothing shall be impossible to you.\"[fn-49-P4979_1793529:57-nf] And therefore even if all the grounds for being heard which we have mentioned are altogether wanting, at any rate the earnestness of importunity may animate us, as this is placed in the power of any one who wills without the difficulties of any merits or labours. But let not any suppliant doubt that he certainly will not be heard, so long as he doubts whether he is heard. But that this also shall be sought from the Lord unweariedly, we are taught by the example of the blessed Daniel, as, though he was heard from the first day on which he began to pray, he only obtained the result of his petition after one and twenty days.[fn-49-P4980_1794179:58-nf] Wherefore we also ought not to grow slack in the earnestness of the prayers we have begun, if we fancy that the answer comes but slowly, for fear lest perhaps the gift of the answer be in God's providence delayed, or the angel, who was to bring the Divine blessing to us, may when he comes forth from the Presence of the Almighty be hindered by the resistance of the devil, as it is certain that he cannot transmit and bring to us the desired boon, if he finds that we slack off from the earnestness of the petition made. And this would certainly have happened to the above mentioned prophet unless he had with incomparable steadfastness prolonged and persevered in his prayers until the twenty-first day. Let us then not be at all cast down by despair from the confidence of this faith of ours, even when we fancy that we are far from having obtained what we prayed for, and let us not have any doubts about the Lord's promise where He says: \"All things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing, ye shall receive.\"[fn-49-P4981_1795222:59-nf] For it is well for us to consider this saying of the blessed Evangelist John, by which the ambiguity of this question is clearly solved: \"This is,\" he says, \"the confidence which we have in Him, that whatsoever we ask according to His will, He heareth us.\"[fn-49-P4982_1795789:60-nf] He bids us then have a full and undoubting confidence of the answer only in those things which are not for our own advantage or for temporal comforts, but are in conformity to the Lord's will. And we are also taught to put this into our prayers by the Lord's Prayer, where we say \"Thy will be done,\"-Thine not ours. For if we also remember these words of the Apostle that \"we know not what to pray for as we ought\"[fn-49-P4983_1796228:61-nf] we shall see that we sometimes ask for things opposed to our salvation and that we are most providentially refused our requests by Him who sees what is good for us with greater right and truth than we can. And it is clear that this also happened to the teacher of the Gentiles when he prayed that the messenger of Satan who had been for his good allowed by the Lord's will to buffet him, might be removed, saying: \"For which I besought the Lord thrice that he might depart from me. And He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee, for strength is made perfect in weakness.\"[fn-49-P4984_1796840:62-nf] And this feeling even our Lord expressed when He prayed in the character[fn-49-P4985_1796933:63-nf] of man which He had taken, that He might give us a form of prayer as other things also by His example; saying thus: \"Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt,\"[fn-49-P4986_1797176:64-nf] though certainly His will was not discordant with His Father's will, \"For He had come to save what was lost and to give His life a ransom for many;\"[fn-49-P4987_1797346:65-nf] as He Himself says: \"No man taketh my life from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again.\"[fn-49-P4988_1797507:66-nf] In which character there is in the thirty-ninth Psalm the following sung by the blessed David, of the Unity of will which He ever maintained with the Father: \"To do Thy will: O My God, I am willing.\"[fn-49-P4989_1797727:67-nf] For even if we read of the Father: \"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son,\"[fn-49-P4990_1797852:68-nf] we find none the less of the Son: \"Who gave Himself for our sins.\"[fn-49-P4991_1797935:69-nf] And as it is said of the One: \"Who spared not His own Son, but gave Him for all of us,\"[fn-49-P4992_1798044:70-nf] so it is written of the other: \"He was offered because He Himself willed it.\"[fn-49-P4993_1798146:71-nf] And it is shown that the will of the Father and of the Son is in all things one, so that even in the actual mystery of the Lord's resurrection we are taught that there was no discord of operation. For just as the blessed Apostle declares that the Father brought about the resurrection of His body, saying: \"And God the Father, who raised Him from the dead,\"[fn-49-P4994_1798569:72-nf] so also the Son testifies that He Himself will raise again the Temple of His body, saying: \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again.\"[fn-49-P4995_1798808:73-nf] And therefore we being instructed by all these examples of our Lord which have been enumerated ought to end our supplications also with the same prayer, and always to subjoin this clause to all our petitions: \"Nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt.\"[fn-49-P4996_1799084:74-nf] But it is clear enough that one who does not[fn-49-P4997_1799204:75-nf] pray with attention of mind cannot observe that threefold reverence[fn-49-P4998_1800699:76-nf] which is usually practised in the assemblies of the brethren at the close of service.","title":"IX.
