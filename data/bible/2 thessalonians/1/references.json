But I cannot forbear to remark that \"the wise hearer\" will find sufficient proof of the proposition before him by following the method of contraries.

But the folly of the obliteration is clearly seen. For as the apostle declares that the Lord will come \"to take vengeance on them that know not God and that obey not the gospel, who,\" he says, \"shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power\"[fn-79-P7924_2257398:732-nf] -it follows that, as He comes to inflict punishment, He must require \"the flaming fire.\" Thus on this consideration too we must, notwithstanding Marcion's opposition, conclude that Christ belongs to a God who kindles the flames[fn-79-P7925_2257651:733-nf] (of vengeance), and therefore to the Creator, inasmuch as He takes vengeance on such as know not the Lord, that is, on the heathen. For he has mentioned separately \"those who obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ,\"[fn-79-P7926_2257896:734-nf] whether they be sinners among Christians or among Jews. Now, to inflict punishment on the heathen, who very likely have never heard of the Gospel, is not the function of that God who is naturally unknown, and who is revealed nowhere else than in the Gospel, and therefore cannot be known by all men.[fn-79-P7927_2258218:735-nf] The Creator, however, ought to be known even by (the light of) nature, for He may be understood from His works, and may thereby become the object of a more widely spread knowledge. To Him, therefore, does it appertain to punish such as know not God, for none ought to be ignorant of Him. In the (apostle's) phrase, \"From the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power,\"[fn-79-P7928_2258628:736-nf] he uses the words of Isaiah who for the express reason makes the self-same Lord \"arise to shake terribly the earth.\"[fn-79-P7929_2258767:737-nf] Well, but who is the man of sin, the son of perdition,\" who must first be revealed before the Lord comes; \"who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; who is to sit in the temple of God, and boast himself as being God? \"[fn-79-P7930_2259085:738-nf] According indeed to our view, he is Antichrist; as it is taught us in both the ancient and the new prophecies,[fn-79-P7931_2259222:739-nf] and especially by the Apostle John, who says that \"already many false prophets are gone out into the world,\" the fore-runners of Antichrist, who deny that Christ is come in the flesh,[fn-79-P7932_2259460:740-nf] and do not acknowledge[fn-79-P7933_2259506:741-nf] Jesus (to be the Christ), meaning in God the Creator. According, however, to Marcion's view, it is really hard to know whether He might not be (after all) the Creator's Christ; because according to him He is not yet come. But whichsoever of the two it is, I want to know why he comes \"in all power, and with lying signs and wonders? \"[fn-79-P7934_2260736:742-nf] \"Because,\" he says, \"they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved; for which cause God shall send them an instinct of delusion[fn-79-P7935_2260907:743-nf] (to believe a lie), that they all might be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.\"[fn-79-P7936_2261052:744-nf] If therefore he be Antichrist, (as we hold), and comes according to the Creator's purpose, it must be God the Creator who sends him to fasten in their error those who did not believe the truth, that they might be saved; His likewise must be the truth and the salvation, who avenges (the contempt of) them by sending error as their substitute[fn-79-P7937_2261421:745-nf] -that is, the Creator, to whom that very wrath is a fitting attribute, which deceives with a lie those who are not captivated with truth. If, however, he is not Antichrist, as we suppose (him to be) then He is the Christ of the Creator, as Marcion will have it. In this case how happens it that he[fn-79-P7938_2261744:746-nf] can suborn the Creator's Christ to avenge his truth? But should he after all agree with us, that Antichrist is here meant, I must then likewise ask how it is that he finds Satan, an angel of the Creator, necessary to his purpose? Why, too, should Antichrist be slain by Him, whilst commissioned by the Creator to execute the function[fn-79-P7939_2262255:747-nf] of inspiring men with their love of untruth? In short, it is incontestable that the emissary,[fn-79-P7940_2262379:748-nf] and the truth, and the salvation belong to Him to whom also appertain the wrath, and the jealousy,[fn-79-P7941_2262530:749-nf] and \"the sending of the strong delusion,\"[fn-79-P7942_2262590:750-nf] on those who despise and mock, as well as upon those who are ignorant of Him; and therefore even Marcion will now have to come down a step, and concede to us that his god is \"a jealous god.\" (This being then an unquestionable position, I ask) which God has the greater fight to be angry?

Lastly, as regards Faustus' crafty insinuation, that the Old Testament misrepresents God as threatening to come with a sword which will spare neither the righteous nor the wicked, if the words were explained to the Pagan, he would perhaps disagree neither with the Old Testament nor with the New; and he might see the beauty of the parable in the Gospel, which people who pretend to be Christians either misunderstand from their blindness, or reject from their perversity. The great husbandman of the vine uses his pruning-hook differently in the fruitful and in the unfruitful branches; yet he spares neither good nor bad, pruning one and cutting off the other.[fn-20-P2079_1220162:41-nf] There is no man so just as not to require to be tried by affliction to advance, or to establish, or to prove his virtue. Do the Manichaeans not reckon Paul as righteous, who, while confessing humbly and honestly his past sins, still gives thanks for being justified by faith in Jesus Christ? Was Paul then spared by Him whom fools misunderstand, when He says, \"I will spare neither the righteous nor the sinner\"? Hear the apostle himself: \"Lest I should be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelation, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me. For this I besought the Lord thrice, that He would remove it from me; and He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for strength is perfected in weakness.\"[fn-20-P2080_1220937:42-nf] Here a just man is not spared that his strength might be perfected in weakness by Him who had given him an angel of Satan to buffet him. If you say that the devil gave this angel, it follows that the devil sought to prevent Paul's being exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelation, and to perfect his strength. This is impossible. Therefore He who gave up this righteous man to be buffeted by the messenger of Satan, is the same as He who, through Paul, gave up to Satan himself the wicked persons of whom Paul says: \"I have delivered them to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.\"[fn-20-P2081_1221561:43-nf] Do you see now how the Most High spares neither the righteous nor the wicked? Or is it the sword that frightens you? For to be buffeted is not so bad as to be put to death. But did not the thousands of martyrs suffer death in various forms? And could their persecutors have had this power against them except it had been given them by God, who thus spared neither the righteous nor the wicked? For the Lord Himself, the chief martyr, says expressly to Pilate: \"Thou couldst have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above.\"[fn-20-P2082_1222126:44-nf] Paul also, besides recording his own experience, says that the afflictions and persecutions of the righteous exhibit the judgment of God.[fn-20-P2083_1222283:45-nf] This truth is set forth at length by the Apostle Peter in the passage already quoted, where he says: \"It is time that judgment should begin at the house of the Lord. And if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of those that believe not the gospel of God? And if the righteous scarcely are saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?\"[fn-20-P2084_1222654:46-nf] Peter also explains how the wicked are not spared, for they are branches broken off to be burnt; while the righteous are not spared, because their purification is to be brought to perfection. He ascribes these things to the will of Him who says in the Old Testament, I will spare neither the righteous nor the wicked; for he says: \"It is better, if the will of the Spirit of God be so, that we suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing.\"[fn-20-P2085_1223116:47-nf] So, when by the will of the Spirit of God men suffer for well-doing, the righteous are not spared; when they suffer for evil-doing, the wicked are not spared. In both cases it is according to the will of Him who says: I will spare neither the righteous nor the wicked; correcting the one as a son, and punishing the other as a transgressor.","title":"Book XXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_40_a_treatise_on_grace_and_free_will_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"65","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"The excuse such as men are in the habit of alleging from ignorance is taken away from those persons who know God's commandments. But neither will those be without punishment who know not the law of God. \"For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law; and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law.\"[fn-59-P5935_2319280:38-nf] Now the apostle does not appear to me to have said this as if he meant that they would have to suffer something worse who in their sins are ignorant of the law than they who know it. [III.] It is seemingly worse, no doubt, \"to perish\" than \"to be judged;\" but inasmuch as he was speaking of the Gentiles and of the Jews when he used these words, because the former were without the law, but the latter had received the law, who can venture to say that the Jews who sin in the law will not perish, since they refused to believe in Christ, when it was of them that the apostle said, \"They shall be judged by the law\"? For without faith in Christ no man can be delivered; and therefore they will be so judged that they perish. If, indeed, the condition of those who are ignorant of the law of God is worse than the condition of those who know it, how can that be true which the Lord says in the gospel: \"The servant who knows not his lord's will, and commits things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes; whereas the servant who knows his lord's will, and commits things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with many stripes \"?[fn-59-P5936_2320437:39-nf] Observe how clearly He here shows that it is a graver matter for a man to sin with knowledge than in ignorance. And yet we must not on this account betake ourselves for refuge to the shades of ignorance, with the view of finding our excuse therein. It is one thing to be ignorant, and another thing to be unwilling to know. For the will is at fault in the case of the man of whom it is said, \"He is not inclined to understand, so as to do good.\"[fn-59-P5937_2320906:40-nf] But even the ignorance, which is not theirs who refuse to know, but theirs who are, as it were, simply ignorant, does not so far excuse any one as to exempt him from the punishment of eternal fire, though his failure to believe has been the result of his not having at all heard what he should believe; but probably only so far as to mitigate his punishment. For it was not said without reason: \"Pour out Thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known Thee;\"[fn-59-P5938_2321384:41-nf] nor again according to what the apostle says: \"When He shall come from heaven in a flame of fire to take vengeance on them that know not God.\"[fn-59-P5939_2321545:42-nf] But yet in order that we may have that knowledge that will prevent our saying, each one of us, \"I did not know,\" \"I did not hear,\" \"I did not understand;\" the human will is summoned, in such words as these: \"Wish not to be as the horse or as the mule, which have no understanding;\"[fn-59-P5940_2321850:43-nf] although it may show itself even worse, of which it is written, \"A stubborn servant will not be reproved by words; for even if he understand, yet he will not obey.\"[fn-59-P5941_2322034:44-nf] But when a man says, \"I cannot do what I am commanded, because I am mastered by my concupiscence,\" he has no longer any excuse to plead from ignorance, nor reason to blame God in his heart, but he recognises and laments his own evil in himself; and still to such an one the apostle says: \"Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good;\"[fn-59-P5942_2322399:45-nf] and of course the very fact that the injunction, \"Consent not to be overcome,\" is addressed to him, undoubtedly summons the determination of his will.

And nothing else than this is shown us by the words of our Lord when He says to His disciples, Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you.\"[fn-62-P6216_2395703:220-nf] For if we first loved Him, in order that by this merit He might love us, then we first chose Him that we might deserve to be chosen by Him. He, however, who is the Truth says otherwise, and flatly contradicts this vain conceit of men. \"You have not chosen me,\" He says. If, therefore, you have not chosen me, undoubtedly you have not loved me (for how could they choose one whom they did not love?). \"But I,\" says He, \"have chosen you.\" And then could they possibly help choosing Him afterwards, and preferring Him to all the blessings of this world? But it was because they had been chosen, that they chose Him; not because they chose Him that they were chosen. There could be no merit in men's choice of Christ, if it were not that God's grace was prevenient in His choosing them. Whence the Apostle Paul pronounces in the Thessalonians this benediction: \"The Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men.\"[fn-62-P6217_2396672:221-nf] This benediction to love one another He gave us, who had also given us a law that we should love each other. Then, in another passage addressed to the same church, seeing that there now existed in some of its members the disposition which he had wished them to cultivate, he says, \"We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth.\"[fn-62-P6218_2397161:222-nf] This he said lest they should make a boast of the great good which they were enjoying from God, as if they had it of their own mere selves. Because, then, your faith has so great a growth (this is the purport of his words), and the love of every one of you all toward each other so greatly abounds, we ought to thank God concerning you, but not to praise you, as if you possessed these gifts of yourselves.","title":"A Treatise on Grace and Free Will.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_33_on_our_lord_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"25","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"22. But why instead of a stern reproof did our Lord speak a parable of persuasion to that Pharisee? He spoke the parable to him tenderly, that he, though froward, might unawares be enticed to correct his perversities. For the waters that are congealed by the force of a cold wind, the heat of the sun gently dissolves. So our Lord did not at once oppose him harshly, that he might not give occasion to the rebellious to rebel again. But by blandishment Hebrought him under the yoke, that when he had been yoked, He might work with him, though rebellious, according to His will. Now, because Simon was proudly minded, our Lord began humbly with him, that He might not be to him a teacher according to his folly. For if that Pharisee retained the Pharisees' pride, how could our Lord cause him to acquire humility, when the treasure of humility was not under his hand? But since our Lord was teaching humility to all men, He showed that His treasury was free from every form of pride. But this was for our sakes, that He might teach us, that whatever treasuries pride enters into, it is by boastfulness that it gains access to them. On this account let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth.[fn-37-P3757_1209264:22-nf] Our Lord then did not employ harsh reproof, because His coming was of grace: He did not refrain from reproof, because His later coming will be of retribution. For He put men to fear in His coming of humility; because it is a fearful thing to fall into His hands[fn-37-P3758_1209543:23-nf] when He shall come in flaming fire.[fn-37-P3759_1209597:24-nf] But our Lord bestowed the most part of His helps rather by persuasion than by reproof. For the gentle shower softens the earth and penetrates all through it: but violent rain binds and hardens the face of the earth, so that it does not receive it. For a harsh word excites wrath, and with it are bound up wrongs.

For I reckon that the sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.\"[fn-110-P11093_3149485:95-nf] And therefore he afterward says: \"Who shall separate us from the love of God? Shall tribulation, or distress, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? (As it is written: For Thy sake we are killed all the day long; we have been counted as sheep for the slaughter, ) Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors, through Him who loved us. For we are persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor power, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\"[fn-110-P11094_3150053:96-nf] But further, in recounting his own sufferings to the Corinthians, he certainly decided that suffering must be borne: \"In labours, (he says, ) more abundant, in prisons very frequent, in deaths oft. Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes, save one; thrice was I beaten with rods; once was I stoned,\"[fn-110-P11095_3150381:97-nf] and the rest. And if these severities will seem to be more grievous than martyrdoms, yet once more he says: \"Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake.\"[fn-110-P11096_3150634:98-nf] He also says, in verses occurring in a previous part of the epistle: \"Our condition is such, that we are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; and are in need, but not in utter want; since we are harassed by persecutions, but not forsaken; it is such that we are east down, but not destroyed; always bearing about in our body the dying of Christ.\"[fn-110-P11097_3151009:99-nf] \"But though,\" says he, \"our outward man perisheth\"-the flesh doubtless, by the violence of persecutions-\"yet the inward man is renewed day by day\"-the soul, doubtless, by hope in the promises. \"For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal\"-he is speaking of troubles; \"but the things which are not seen are eternal\"-he is promising rewards. But writing in bonds to the Thessalonians,[fn-110-P11098_3151615:100-nf] he certainly affirmed that they were blessed, since to them it had been given not only to believe on Christ, but also to suffer for His sake. \"Having,\" says he, \"the same conflier which ye both saw in me, and now hear to be in me.\"[fn-110-P11099_3151899:101-nf] \"For though I are offered upon the sacrifice, I joy and rejoice with you all; in like manner do ye also joy and rejoice with me.\" You see what he decides the bliss of martyrdom to be, in honour of which he is providing a festival of mutual joy. When at length he had come to be very near the attainment of his desire, greatly rejoicing in what he saw before him, he writes in these terms to Timothy: \"For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought the good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith; there is laid up for me the crown which the Lord will give me on that day\"[fn-111-P11100_3152549:102-nf] -doubtless of his suffering. Admonition enough did he for his part also give in preceding passages: \"It is a faithful saying: For if we are dead with Christ, we shall also live with Him; if we suffer, we shall also reign with Him; if we deny Him, He also will deny us; if we believe not, yet He is faithful: He cannot deny Himself.\"[fn-111-P11101_3152903:103-nf] \"Be not thou, therefore, ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner; \"[fn-111-P11102_3153013:104-nf] for he had said before: \"For God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.\"[fn-111-P11103_3153153:105-nf] For we suffer with power from love toward God, and with a sound mind, when we suffer for our blamelessness.

Since therefore, beyond all doubt and contradiction, the apostle shows that there is one and the same God, who did both enter into judgment with these former things, and who does inquire into those of the present time, and points out why these things have been committed to writing; all these men are found to be unlearned and presumptuous, nay, even destitute of common sense, who, because of the transgressions of them of old time, and because of the disobedience of a vast number of them, do allege that there was indeed one God of these men, and that He was the maker of the world, and existed in a state of degeneracy; but that there was another Father declared by Christ, and that this Being is He who has been conceived by the mind of each of them; not understanding that as, in the former case, God showed Himself not well pleased in many stances towards those who sinned, so also in the latter, \"many are called, but few are chosen.\"[fn-85-P8539_2406789:391-nf] As then the unrighteous, the idolaters, and fornicators perished, so also is it now: for both the Lord declares, that such persons are sent into eternal fire;[fn-85-P8540_2406969:392-nf] and the apostle says, \"Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, not effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-85-P8541_2407319:393-nf] And as it was not to those who are without that he said these things, but to us. lest we should be cast forth from the kingdom of God, by doing any such thing, he proceeds to say, \"And such indeed were ye; but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by the Spirit of our God.\" And just as then, those who led vicious lives, and put other people astray, were condemned and cast out, so also even now the offending eye is plucked out, and the foot and the hand, lest the rest of the body perish in like manner.[fn-85-P8542_2407892:394-nf] And we have the precept: \"If any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with such an one no not to eat.\"[fn-85-P8543_2408106:395-nf] And again does the apostle say, \"Let no man deceive you with vain words; for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of mistrust. Be not ye therefore par-takers with them.\"[fn-85-P8544_2408322:396-nf] And as then the condemnation of sinners extended to others who approved of them, and joined in their society; so also is it the case at present, that \"a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.\"[fn-85-P8545_2408537:397-nf] And as the wrath of God did then descend upon the unrighteous, here also does the apostle likewise say: \"For the wrath of God shall be revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of those men who hold back the truth in unrighteousness.\"[fn-85-P8546_2408815:398-nf] And as, in those times, vengeance came from God upon the Egyptians who were subjecting Israel to unjust punishment, so is it now, the Lord truly declaring, \"And shall not God avenge His own elect, which cry day and night unto Him? I tell you, that He will avenge them speedily.\"[fn-85-P8547_2409113:399-nf] So says the apostle, in like manner, in the Epistle to the Thessalonians: \"Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you; and to you who are troubled rest with us, at the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ from heaven with His mighty angels, and in a flame of fire, to take vengeance upon those who know not God, and upon those that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: who shall also be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power; when He shall come to be glorified in His saints, and to be admired in all them who have believed in Him.\"[fn-85-P8548_2409791:400-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":1,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_62_book_iv_","source_chapter":35,"source_paragraph":"216","folder":"ANF-01","text":"11.
