This I have done in the present book, with perhaps a fuller statement than is necessary, although I seem to myself to have said too little against the opponents of the grace of God. And I am never so much delighted in my treatment of a subject as when Scripture comes most copiously to my aid; and when the question to be discussed requires that \"he that glorieth should glory in the Lord;\"[fn-18-P1818_796284:370-nf] and that we should in all things lift up our hearts and give thanks to the Lord our God, from whom, \"as the Father of lights, every good and every perfect gift cometh down.\"[fn-18-P1819_796479:371-nf] Now if a gift is not God's gift, because it is wrought by us, or because we act by His gift, then it is not a work of God that \"a mountain should be removed into the sea,\" inasmuch as, according to the Lord's statement, it is by the faith of men that this is possible. Moreover, He attributes the deed to their actual operation: \"If ye have faith in yourselves as a grain of mustard-seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, \"Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and it shall be done, and nothing shall be impossible to you.\"[fn-18-P1820_797033:372-nf] Observe how He said \"to you,\" not \"to Me\" or \"to the Father;\" and yet it is certain that no man does such a thing without God's gift and operation. See how an instance of perfect righteousness is unexampled among men, and yet is not impossible. For it might be achieved if there were only applied so much of will as suffices for so great a thing. There would, however, be so much will, if there were hidden from us none of those conditions which pertain to righteousness; and at the same time these so delighted our mind, that whatever hindrance of pleasure or pain might else occur, this delight in holiness would prevail over every rival affection. And that this is not realized, is not owing to any intrinsic impossibility, but to God's judicial act. For who can be ignorant, that what he should know is not in man's power; nor does it follow that what he has discovered to be a desirable object is actually desired, unless he also feel a delight in that object, commensurate with its claims on his affection? For this belongs to health of soul.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_10_lecture_v_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"11.

It may perhaps be said, `We find Him giving way to weeping, to hunger and thirst: must we not suppose Him liable to all the other affections of human nature?' But if we do not understand the mystery of His tears, hunger, and thirst, let us remember that He Who wept also raised the dead to life: that He did not weep for the death of Lazarus, but rejoiced[fn-20-P2009_1311346:34-nf] ; that He Who thirsted, gave from Himself rivers of living water[fn-20-P2010_1311541:35-nf] . He could not be parched with thirst, if He was able to give the thirsty drink. Again, He Who hungered could condemn the tree which offered no fruit for His hunger[fn-20-P2011_1311729:36-nf] : but how could His nature be overcome by hunger if He could strike the green tree barren by His word? And if, beside the mystery of weeping, hunger and thirst, the flesh He assumed, that is His entire manhood, was exposed to our weaknesses: even then it was not left to suffer from their indignities. His weeping was not for Himself; His thirst needed no water to quench it; His hunger no food to stay it. It is never said that the Lord ate or drank or wept when He was hungry, or thirsty, or sorrowful. He conformed to the habits of the body to prove the reality of His own body, to satisfy the custom of human bodies by doing as our nature does. When He ate and drank, it was a concession, not to His own necessities, but to our habits.","title":"Book X","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":11,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_18_lecture_xiii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"19","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"18.

At the time of the sin, they clothed themselves with fig-leaves; for this cause Jesus also made the fig-tree the last of His signs. For when about to go to His passion, He curses the fig-tree, not every fig-tree, but that one alone, for the sake of the figure; saying, No more let any man eat fruit of thee[fn-17-P1701_470195:82-nf] ; let the doom be cancelled. And because they aforetime clothed themselves with fig-leaves, He came at a season when food was not wont to be found on the fig-tree.

Matthew goes on with his narrative in the following terms: \"And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the Mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples, saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her;\" and so on, down to the words, \"Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.\"[fn-20-P2075_852639:472-nf] Mark also records this occurrence, and inserts it in the same order.[fn-20-P2076_852731:473-nf] Luke, on the other hand, tarries a space by Jericho, recounting certain matters which these others have omitted,-namely, the story of Zacchaeus, the chief of the publicans, and some sayings which are couched in parabolic form. After instancing these things, however, this evangelist again joins company with the others in the narrative relating to the ass on which Jesus sat.[fn-20-P2077_853129:474-nf] And let not the circumstance stagger us, that Matthew speaks both of an ass and of the colt of an ass, while the others say nothing of the ass. For here again we must bear in mind the rule which we have already introduced in dealing with the statements about the seating of the people by fifties and by hundreds on the occasion on which the multitudes were fed with the five loaves.[fn-20-P2078_853535:475-nf] Now, after this principle has been brought into application, the reader should not feel any serious difficulty in the present case. Indeed, even had Matthew said nothing about the colt, just as his fellow-historians have taken no notice of the ass, the fact should not have created any such perplexity as to induce the idea of an insuperable contradiction between the two statements, when the one writer speaks only of the ass, and the others only of the colt of the ass. But how much less cause then for any disquietude ought there to be, when we see that the one writer has mentioned the ass to which the others have omitted to refer, in such a manner as at the same time not to leave unnoticed also the colt of which the rest have spoken! In fine, where it is possible to suppose both objects to have been included in the occurrence, there is no real antagonism, although the one writer may specify only the one thing, and another only the other.

For first of all, the fact which is related by Matthew, namely, that Jesus went into the temple, and cast out those who sold and bought there, is not mentioned at that point by Mark. On the other hand, Mark tells us that He looked round about upon all things, and, when the eventide was now come, went out into Bethany with the twelve. Next he informs us that on another day,[fn-20-P2094_862114:483-nf] when they were coming from Bethany, He was hungry, and cursed the fig-tree, as Matthew also intimates. Then the said Mark subjoins the statement that He came into Jerusalem, and that, on going into the temple, He cast out those who sold and bought there, as if that incident took place not on the first day specified, but on a different day.[fn-20-P2095_862473:484-nf] But inasmuch as Matthew puts the connection in these terms, \"And He left them, and went out of the city into Bethany,\"[fn-20-P2096_862615:485-nf] and tells us that it was when returning in the morning into the city that He cursed the tree, it is more reasonable to suppose that he, rather than Mark, has preserved the strict order of time so far as regards the incident of the expulsion of the sellers and buyers from the temple. For when he uses the phrase, \"And He left them, and went out,\" who can be understood by those parties whom He is thus said to have left, but those with whom He was previously speaking,-namely, the persons who were so sore displeased because the children cried out, \"Hosanna to the Son of David\"? It follows, then, that Mark has omitted what took place on the first day, when He went into the temple; and in mentioning that He found nothing on the fig-tree but leaves, he has introduced what He called to mind only there, but what really occurred on the second day, as both evangelists testify. Then, further, his account bears that the astonishment which the disciples expressed at finding how the fig-tree had withered away, and the reply which the Lord made to them on the subject of faith, and the casting of the mountain into the sea, belonged not to this same second day on which He said to the tree, \"No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever,\" but to a third day. For in connection with the second day, the said Mark has recorded the incident of the casting of the sellers out of the temple, which he had omitted to notice as belonging to the first day. Accordingly, it is in connection with this second day that he tells us how Jesus went out of the city, when even was come, and how, when they passed by in the morning, the disciples saw the fig-tree dried up from the roots, and how Peter, calling to remembrance, said unto Him, \"Master, behold the fig-tree which Thou cursedst is withered away.\"[fn-20-P2097_864430:486-nf] Then, too, he informs us that He gave the answer relating to the power of faith. On the other hand, Matthew recounts these matters in a manner importing that they all took place on this second day; that is to say, both the word addressed to the tree, \"Let no fruit grow on thee from henceforward for ever,\" and the withering that ensued so speedily in the tree, and the reply which He made on the subject of the power of faith to His disciples when they observed that withering and marvelled at it. Fromthis we are to understand that Mark, on his side, has recorded in connection with the second day what he had omitted to notice as occurring really on the first,-namely, the incident of the expulsion of the sellers and buyers from the temple. On the other hand, Matthew, after mentioningwhat was done on the second day,- namely, the cursing of the fig-tree as He was returning in the morning from Bethany into the city,-has omitted certain facts which Mark has inserted, namely, His coming into the city, andHis going out of it in the evening, and the astonishment which the disciples expressed at finding the tree dried up as they passed by in the morning; and then to what had taken place on the second day, which was the day on which the tree was cursed, he has attached what really took place on the third day, -namely, the amazement of the disciples at seeing the tree's withered condition, and the declaration which they heard froth the Lord on the subject of the power of faith.[fn-20-P2098_865944:487-nf] These several facts Matthew has connected together in such a manner that, were we not compelled to turn our attention to the matter by Mark's narrative, we should be unable to recognise either at what point or with regard to what circumstances the former writer has left anything unrecorded in his narrative. The case therefore stands thus: Matthew first presents the facts conveyed in these words, \"And He left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and He lodged there. Now in the morning, as He returned into the city, He hungered; and when He saw a single fig-tree in the way, He came to it, and found nothing thereon but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever; and presently the fig-tree withered away.\" Then, omitting the other matters which belonged to that same day, he has immediately subjoined this statement, \"And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is it withered away!\" although it was on another day that they saw this sight, and on another day that they thus marvelled. But it is understood that the tree did not wither at the precise time when they saw it, but presently when it was cursed. For what they saw was not the tree in the process of drying up, but the tree already dried completely up; and thus they learned that it had withered away immediately on the Lord's sentence.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":70,"source_paragraph":"285","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"131.

Fromthis we are to understand that Mark, on his side, has recorded in connection with the second day what he had omitted to notice as occurring really on the first,-namely, the incident of the expulsion of the sellers and buyers from the temple. On the other hand, Matthew, after mentioningwhat was done on the second day,- namely, the cursing of the fig-tree as He was returning in the morning from Bethany into the city,-has omitted certain facts which Mark has inserted, namely, His coming into the city, andHis going out of it in the evening, and the astonishment which the disciples expressed at finding the tree dried up as they passed by in the morning; and then to what had taken place on the second day, which was the day on which the tree was cursed, he has attached what really took place on the third day, -namely, the amazement of the disciples at seeing the tree's withered condition, and the declaration which they heard froth the Lord on the subject of the power of faith.[fn-20-P2098_865944:487-nf] These several facts Matthew has connected together in such a manner that, were we not compelled to turn our attention to the matter by Mark's narrative, we should be unable to recognise either at what point or with regard to what circumstances the former writer has left anything unrecorded in his narrative. The case therefore stands thus: Matthew first presents the facts conveyed in these words, \"And He left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and He lodged there. Now in the morning, as He returned into the city, He hungered; and when He saw a single fig-tree in the way, He came to it, and found nothing thereon but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever; and presently the fig-tree withered away.\" Then, omitting the other matters which belonged to that same day, he has immediately subjoined this statement, \"And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is it withered away!\" although it was on another day that they saw this sight, and on another day that they thus marvelled. But it is understood that the tree did not wither at the precise time when they saw it, but presently when it was cursed. For what they saw was not the tree in the process of drying up, but the tree already dried completely up; and thus they learned that it had withered away immediately on the Lord's sentence.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":27,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":71,"source_paragraph":"287","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"132.

My tears have been my meat day and night,\"[fn-49-P4943_1785188:41-nf] declaring with daily crying and lamentation: \"Woe is me that my sojourning is prolonged;\" and: \"Too long hath my soul been a sojourner.\"[fn-49-P4944_1785349:42-nf] In another way do the tears flow forth, which without any conscience of deadly sin, yet still proceed from the fear of hell and the recollection of It hat terrible judgment, with the terror of which the prophet was smitten and prayed to God, saying: \"Enter not into judgment with Thy servant, for in Thy sight shall no man living be justified.\"[fn-49-P4945_1785714:43-nf] There is too another kind of tears, which are caused not by knowledge of one's self but by the hardness and sins of others; whereby Samuel is described as having wept for Saul, and both the Lord in the gospel and Jeremiah in former days for the city of Jerusalem, the latter thus saying: \"Oh, that my head were water and mine eyes a fountain of tears!

Now that in order to convey this truth the Lord acted prophetically, I mean that, as concerning this tree, it was not His will merely to exhibit a miracle, but that by the miracle He conveyed the intimation of something to come, there are many things which teach and persuade us, yea even against our wills force us to believe. In the first place, what fault in the tree was it that it had no fruit, when even if it had no fruit at the proper season, that is, the season of its fruit, it would not assuredly be any fault in the tree; for the tree as being without sense and reason could not be to blame. But to this is added, that as we read it in the narrative of the other Evangelist who expressly mentions this, \"it was not the time for that fruit.\"[fn-47-P4797_2058203:16-nf] For that was the time when the fig-tree shoots forth its tender leaves, which come, we know, before the fruit; and this we prove, because the day of the Lord's Passion was at hand, and we know at what time He suffered; and if we did not know it, we ought of course to give credit to the Evangelist who says, \"The time of figs was not yet.\" So then if it was only a miracle that was to have been set forth, and not something to be prophetically figured, it would have been much more worthy of the clemency and mercy of the Lord, to have made green again any tree He might find withered; as He healed the sick, as He cleansed the lepers, as He raised the dead. But then contrariwise, as though against the ordinary rule of His clemency, He found a green tree, not yet bearing fruit out of its proper season, but still not refusing the hope of fruit to its dresser, and He withered it away; as though He would say to us, \"I have no delight in the withering away of this tree, but thus I would convey to you, that I have not designed to do this without any cause for it, but only because I desired thereby to convey to you a lesson you might the more regard.

Now we find that three dead persons were raised by the Lord \"visibly,\" thousands \"invisibly.\" Nay, who knows even how many dead He raised visibly? For all the things that He did are not written. John tells us this, \"Many other things Jesus did, the which if they should be written, I suppose that the whole world could not contain the books.\"[fn-51-P5142_2185092:6-nf] So then there were without doubt many others raised: but it is not without a meaning that the three are expressly recorded. For our Lord Jesus Christ would that those things which He did on the body should be also spiritually understood. For He did not merely do miracles for the miracles' sake; but in order that the things which He did should inspire wonder in those who saw them, and convey truth to them who understand. As he who sees letters in an excellently written manuscript, and knows not how to read, praises indeed the transcriber's[fn-51-P5143_2185654:7-nf] hand, and admires the beauty of the characters;[fn-51-P5144_2185717:8-nf] but what those characters mean or signify he does not know; and by the sight of his eyes he is a praiser of the work, but in his mind has no comprehension of it; whereas another man both praises the work, and is capable of understanding it; such an one, I mean, who is not only able to see what is common to all, but who can read also; which he who has never learned cannot. So they who saw Christ's miracles, and understood not what they meant, and what they in a manner conveyed to those who had understanding, wondered only at the miracles themselves; whereas others both wondered at the miracles, and attained to the meaning of them. Such ought we to be in the school of Christ. For he who says that Christ only worked miracles, for the miracles' sake, may say too that He was ignorant that it was not the thee for fruit, when He sought figs upon the figtree.[fn-51-P5145_2186592:9-nf] For it was not the time for that fruit, as the Evangelist testifies; and yet being hungry He sought for fruit upon the tree. Did not Christ know, what any peasant knew? What the dresser of the tree knew, did not the tree's Creator know? So then when being hungry He sought fruit on the tree, He signified that He was hungry, and seeking after something else than this; and He found that tree without fruit, but full of leaves, and He cursed it, and it withered away. What had the tree done in not bearing fruit? What fault of the tree was its fruitlessness? No; but there are those who through their own will are not able to yield fruit. Andbarrenness is \"their\" fault, whose fruitfulness is their will. The Jews then who had the words of the Law, and had not the deeds, were full of leaves, and bare no fruit. This have I said to persuade you, that our Lord Jesus Christ performed miracles with this view, that by those miracles He might signify something further, that besides that they were wonderful and great, and divine in themselves, we might learn also something from them.","title":"Sermon XLVIII.
