{"verses":["And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalen and Mary the mother\nof James and Salome bought sweet spices, that coming, they might anoint\nJesus.","And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they\ncome to the sepulchre, the sun being now risen.","And they said one to another:  Who shall roll us back the stone\nfrom the door of the sepulchre?","And looking, they saw the stone rolled back.  For it was very\ngreat.","And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on\nthe right side, clothed with a white robe:  and they were astonished.","Who saith to them:  Be not affrighted.  you seek Jesus of Nazareth,\nwho was crucified.  He is risen:  he is not here.  Behold the place where\nthey laid him.","But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you\ninto Galilee.  There you shall see him, as he told you.","But they going out, fled from the sepulchre:  for a trembling and\nfear had seized them.  And they said nothing to any man:  for they were\nafraid.","But he rising early the first day of the week, appeared first to\nMary Magdalen; out of whom he had cast seven devils.","She went and told them that had been with him, who were mourning\nand weeping.","And they hearing that he was alive and had been seen by her, did\nnot believe.","And after that he appeared in another shape to two of them\nwalking, as they were going into the country.","And they going told it to the rest:  neither did they believe\nthem.","At length he appeared to the eleven as they were at table:  and\nhe upbraided them with their incredulity and hardness of heart, because\nthey did not believe them who had seen him after he was risen again.","And he said to them:  Go ye into the whole world and preach the\ngospel to every creature.","He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved:  but he that\nbelieveth not shall he condemned.","And these signs shall follow them that believe:  In my name they\nshall cast out devils.  They shall speak with new tongues.","They shall take up serpents:  and if they shall drink any deadly\nthing, it shall not hurt them.  They shall lay their hand upon the sick:\nand they shall recover.","And the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up\ninto heaven and sitteth on the right hand of God.","But they going forth preached every where:  the Lord working\nwithal, and confirming the word with signs that followed."]}
