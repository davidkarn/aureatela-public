For these, for the most part, are the sources whence, from some ignorance or simplicity, custom finds its beginning; and then it is successionally confirmed into an usage, and thus is maintained in opposition to truth. But our Lord Christ has surnamed Himself Truth,[fn-5-P551_114823:2-nf] not Custom. If Christ is always, and prior to all, equally truth is a thing sempiternal and ancient. Let those therefore look to themselves, to whom that is new which is intrinsically old. It is not so much novelty as truth which convicts heresies. Whatever savours of opposition to truth, this will be heresy, even (if it be an) ancient custom. On the other hand, if any is ignorant of anything, the ignorance proceeds from his own defect. Moreover, whatever is matter of ignorance ought to have been as carefully inquired into as whatever is matter of acknowledgment received. The rule of faith, indeed, is altogether one, alone immoveable and irreformable; the rule, to wit, of believing in one only God omnipotent, the Creator of the universe, and His Son Jesus Christ, born of the Virgin Mary, crucified under Pontius Pilate, raised again the third day from the dead, received in the heavens, sitting now at the right (hand) of the Father, destined to come to judge quick and dead through the resurrection of the flesh as well (as of the spirit). This law of faith being constant, the other succeeding points of discipline and conversation admit the \"novelty\" of correction; the grace of God, to wit, operating and advancing even to the end. For what kind of (supposition) is it, that, while the devil is always operating and adding daily to the ingenuities of iniquity, the work of God should either have ceased, or else have desisted from advancing? whereas the reason why the Lord sent the Paraclete was, that, since human mediocrity was unable to take in all things at once, discipline should, little by little, be directed, and ordained, and carried on to perfection, by that Vicar of the Lord, the Holy Spirit. \"Still,\" He said, \"I have many things to say to you, but ye are not yet able to bear them: when that Spirit of truth shall have come, He will conduct you into all truth, and will report to you the supervening (things).\"[fn-5-P552_116781:3-nf] But above, withal, He made a declaration concerning this His work.[fn-5-P553_116891:4-nf] What, then, is the Paraclete's administrative office but this: the direction of discipline, the revelation of the Scriptures, the reformation of the intellect, the advancement toward the \"better things? \"[fn-5-P554_117117:5-nf] Nothing is without stages of growth: all things await their season. In short, the preacher says, \"A time to everything.\"[fn-5-P555_117269:6-nf] Look how creation itself advances little by little to fructification. First comes the grain, and from the grain arises the shoot, and from the shoot struggles out the shrub: thereafter boughs and leaves gather strength, and the whole that we call a tree expands: then follows the swelling of the germen, and from the germen bursts the flower, and from the flower the fruit opens: that fruit itself, rude for a while, and unshapely, little by little, keeping the straight course of its development, is trained to the mellowness of its flavour.[fn-5-P556_117841:7-nf] So, too, righteousness-for the God of righteousness and of creation is the same-was first in a rudimentary state, having a natural fear of God: from that stage it advanced, through the Law and the Prophets, to infancy; from that stage it passed, through the Gospel, to the fervour of youth: now, through the Paraclete, it is settling into maturity. He will be, after Christ, the only one to be called and revered as Master;[fn-5-P557_118287:8-nf] for He speaks not from Himself, but what is commanded by Christ.[fn-5-P558_118377:9-nf] He is the only prelate, because He alone succeeds Christ.

For the oneness of a work depends not on the number of its authors, but on the agreement or contra-dictoriness of its contents. Whence it is clear that the four Gospels are one Gospel; for, as the four say the same thing, its oneness is preserved by the harmony of the contents, and not impaired by the difference of persons. And Paul is not now speaking of the number but of the discrepancy of the things spoken.

Accordingly, after one of these had been struck off, He commanded the eleven others, on His departure to the Father, to \"go and teach all nations, who were to be baptized into the Father, and into the Son, and into the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-33-P3392_1179945:203-nf] Immediately, therefore, so did the apostles, whom this designation indicates as \"the sent.\" Having, on the authority of a prophecy, which occurs in a psalm of David,[fn-33-P3393_1180136:204-nf] chosen Matthias by lot as the twelfth, into the place of Judas, they obtained the promised power of the Holy Ghost for the gift of miracles and of utterance; and after first bearing witness to the faith in Jesus Christ throughout Judµa, and rounding churches (there), they next went forth into the world and preached the same doctrine of the same faith to the nations. They then in like manner rounded churches in every city, from which all the other churches, one after another, derived the tradition of the faith,[fn-33-P3394_1180697:205-nf] and the seeds of doctrine, and are every day deriving them,[fn-33-P3395_1180780:206-nf] that they may become churches.

The high priest then asked Jesus of His disciples, and of His doctrine. Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I always taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither all the Jews resort, and in secret have I said nothing. Why askest thou me? ask those who heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.\" A question occurs that ought not to be passed over, how it is that the Lord Jesus said, \"I spake openly to the world;\" and in particular that which He afterwards added, \"In secret have I said nothing.\" Did He not, even in that latest discourse which He delivered to the disciples after supper, say to them, \"These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs; but the hour cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall show you plainly of my Father?\"[fn-36-P3634_2011883:9-nf] If, then, He spake not openly even to the more intimate company of His disciples, but gave the promise of a time when He would speak openly, how was it that He spake openly to the world? And still further, as is also testified on the authority of the other evangelists, to those who were truly His own, in comparison with others who were not His disciples, He certainly spake with much greater plainness when He was alone with them at a distance from the multitudes; for then He unfolded to them the parables, which He had uttered in obscure terms to others. What then is the meaning of the words, \"In secret have I said nothing\"? It is in this way we are to understand His saying, \"I spake openly to the world;\" as if He had said, There were many that heard me. And that word \"openly\" was in a certain sense openly and in another sense not openly. It was openly, because many heard Him; and again it was not openly, because they did not understand Him. And even what He spake to His disciples apart, He certainly spake not in secret. For who speaketh in secret, that speaketh before so many persons; as it is written, \"At tim mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established:\"[fn-36-P3635_2013095:10-nf] especially if that be spoken to a few which he wisheth to become known to many through them; as the Lord Himself said to the few whom He had as yet, \"What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light; and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the house-tops\"?[fn-36-P3636_2013384:11-nf] And accordingly the very thing that seemed to be spoken by Himself in secret, was in a certain sense not spoken in secret; for it was not so spoken to remain unuttered by those to whom it was spoken; but rather so in order to be preached in every possible direction. A thing therefore may be uttered at once openly, and not openly; or at the same time in secret, and yet not in secret, as it is said, \"That seeing, they may see, and not see.\"[fn-36-P3637_2013845:12-nf] For how \"may they see,\" save only because it is openly, and not in secret; and again, how is it that the same parties \"may not see,\" save that it is not openly, but in secret? Howbeit the very things which they had heard without understanding, were such as could not with justice or truth be turned into a criminal charge against Him: and as often as they tried by their questions to find something whereof to accuse Him, He gave them such replies as utterly discomfited all their plots, and left no ground for the calumnies they devised.

Those expressions, accordingly, make an impression on very many, which are used by God in speaking of Pharaoh, as when He frequently says, \"I will harden Pharaoh's heart.\"[fn-68-P6849_1448195:62-nf] For if he is hardened by God, and commits sin in consequence of being so hardened, the cause of his sin is not himself. And if so, it will appear that Pharaoh does not possess freedom of will; and it will be maintained, as a consequence, that, agreeably to this illustration, neither do others who perish owe the cause of their destruction to the freedom of their own will. That expression, also, in Ezekiel, when he says, \"I will take away their stony hearts, and will give them hearts of flesh, that they may walk in My precepts, and keep My ways,\"[fn-68-P6850_1448768:63-nf] may impress some, inasmuch as it seems to be a gift of God, either to walk in His ways or to keep His precepts,[fn-68-P6851_1448903:64-nf] if He take away that stony heart which is an obstacle to the keeping of His commandments, and bestow and implant a better and more impressible heart, which is called now[fn-68-P6852_1449095:65-nf] a heart of flesh. Consider also the nature of the answer given in the Gospel by our Lord and Saviour to those who inquired of Him why He spoke to the multitude in parables. His words are: \"That seeing they may not see; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest they should be converted, and their sins be forgiven them.\"[fn-68-P6853_1449546:66-nf] The words, moreover, used by the Apostle Paul, that \"it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy; \"[fn-68-P6854_1449706:67-nf] in another passage also, \"that to will and to do are of God: \"[fn-68-P6855_1449787:68-nf] and again, elsewhere, \"Therefore hath He mercy upon whom He will, and whom He will He hardeneth.

And now, the statements regarding Pharaoh have troubled many, respecting whom God declared several times, \"I will harden Pharaoh's heart.\"[fn-68-P6858_1451150:70-nf] For if he is hardened by God, and commits sin in consequence of being hardened, he is not the cause of sin to himself; and if so, then neither does Pharaoh possess free-will. And some one will say that, in a similar way, they who perish have not free-will, and will not perish of themselves. The declaration also in Ezekiel, \"I will take away their stony hearts, and will put in them hearts of flesh, that they may walk in My precepts, and keep My commandments,\"[fn-68-P6859_1451642:71-nf] might lead one to think that it was God who gave the power to walk in His commandments, and to keep His precepts, by His withdrawing the hindrance-the stony heart, and implanting a better-a heart of flesh. And let us look also at the passage in the Gospel-the answer which the Saviour returns to those who inquired why He spake to the multitude in parables. His words are: \"That seeing they might not see; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest they should be converted, and their sins be forgiven them.\"[fn-68-P6860_1452183:72-nf] The passage also in Paul: \"It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy.\"[fn-68-P6861_1452338:73-nf] The declarations, too, in other places, that \"both to will and to do are of God; \"[fn-68-P6862_1452439:74-nf] \"that God hath mercy upon whom He will have mercy, and whom He will He hardeneth.

Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour? \"[fn-68-P6864_1452954:76-nf] Now these passages are sufficient of themselves to trouble the multitude, as if man were not possessed of free-will, but as if it were God who saves and destroys whom He will.","title":"Book III.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":4,"verse":12,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_47_book_iii_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"ANF-04","text":"16.

And if this be so, then we have no free-will either as regards salvation or destruction.\" Now were it not for the words that are added, \"Lest perhaps they should be converted, and their sins be forgiven them,\" we might be more inclined to return the answer, that the Saviour was unwilling that those individuals whom He foresaw would not become good, should understand the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, and that therefore He spoke to them in parables; but as that addition follows, \"Lest perhaps they should be converted, and their sins be forgiven them,\" the explanation is rendered more difficult. And, in the first place, we have to notice what defence this passage furnishes against those heretics who are accustomed to hunt out of the Old Testament any expressions which seem, according to their view, to predicate severity and cruelty of God the Creator, as when He is described as being affected with the feeling of vengeance or punishment, or by any of those emotions, however named, from which they deny the existence of goodness in the Creator; for they do not judge of the Gospels with the same mind and feelings, and do not observe whether any such statements are found in them as they condemn and censure in the Old Testament. For manifestly, in the passage referred to, the Saviour is shown, as they themselves admit, not to speak distinctly, for this very reason, that men may not be converted, and when converted, receive the remission of sins. Now, if the words be understood according to the letter merely, nothing less, certainly, will be contained in them than in those passages which they find fault with in the Old Testament. And if they are of opinion that any expressions occurring in such a connection in the New Testament stand in need of explanation, it will necessarily follow that those also occurring in the Old Testament, which are the subject of censure, may be freed from aspersion by an explanation of a similar kind, so that by such means the passages found in both Testaments may be shown to proceed from one and the same God.

In the first place, then, we must notice the passage in its bearing on the heretics, who hunt out those portions from the Old Testament where is exhibited, as they themselves daringly assert, the cruelty[fn-69-P6975_1503941:160-nf] of the Creator of the world[fn-69-P6976_1503984:161-nf] in His purpose of avenging and punishing the wicked,[fn-69-P6977_1504057:162-nf] or by whatever other name they wish to designate such a quality, so speaking only that they may say that goodness does not exist in the Creator; and who do not deal with the New Testament in a similar manner, nor in a spirit of candour,[fn-69-P6978_1504354:163-nf] but pass by places similar to those which they consider censurable in the Old Testament. For manifestly, and according to the Gospel, is the Saviour shown, as they assert, by His former words, not to speak distinctly for this reason, that men might not be converted, and, being converted, might become deserving of the remission of sins: which statement of itself is nothing inferior[fn-69-P6979_1504757:164-nf] to those passages from the Old Testament which are objected to. And if they seek to defend the Gospel, we must ask them whether they are not acting in a blameworthy manner in dealing differently with the same questions; and, while not stumbling against the New Testament, but seeking to defend it, they nevertheless bring a charge against the Old regarding similar points, whereas they ought to offer a defence in the same way of the passages from the New. And therefore we shall force them, on account of the resemblances, to regard all as the writings of one God. Come, then, and let us, to the best of our ability, furnish an answer to the question submitted to us.","title":"Book III.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":4,"verse":30,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_46_book_x_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"ANF-10","text":"\"Again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid.\"[fn-73-P7306_1481384:19-nf] The former parables He spoke to the multitudes; but this and the two which follow it, which are not parables but similitudes in relation to the kingdom of heaven, He seems to have spoken to the disciples when in the house. In regard to this and the next two, let him who \"gives heed to reading\"[fn-73-P7307_1481700:20-nf] inquire whether they are parables at all. In the case of the latter the Scripture does not hesitate to attach in each case the name of parable; but in the present case it has not done so; and that naturally. For if He spoke to the multitudes in parables, and \"spake all these things in parables, and without a parable spake nothing to them,\"[fn-73-P7308_1482062:21-nf] but on going to the house He discourses not to the multitudes but to the disciples who came to Him there, manifestly the things spoken in the house were not parables: for, to them that are without. even to those to whom \"it is not given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven,\"[fn-73-P7309_1482369:22-nf] He speaks in parables. Some one will then say, If they are not really parables, what are they? Shall we then say in keeping with the diction of the Scripture that they are similitudes (comparisons)? Now a similitude differs from a parable; for it is written in Mark, \"To what shall we compare the kingdom of God, or in what parable shall we set it forth? \"[fn-73-P7310_1482748:23-nf] From this it is plain that there is a difference between a similitude and a parable. The similitude seems to be generic, and the parable specific. And perhaps also as the similitude, which is the highest genus of the parable, contains the parable as one of its species, so it contains that particular form of similitude which has the same name as the genus. This is the case with other words as those skilled in the giving of many names have observed; who say that \"impulse\"[fn-73-P7311_1483241:24-nf] is the highest genus of many species, as, for example, of \"disinclination\"[fn-73-P7312_1483349:25-nf] and \"inclination.\" and say that, in the case of the species which has the same name as the genus, \"inclination\" is taken in opposition to and in distinction from \"disinclination.\"","title":"Book X.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":4,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_38_letter_of_an_inquirer_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"§10.

Wherefore, in the departure from Egypt, He forbade the multitude to touch the mountain, where God was appointing them the law, because they were not of this character.

Therefore the blessed Paul, when desirous that the grace of the Spirit given to us should not grow cold, exhorts, saying, `Quench not the Spirit[fn-89-P8943_3275256:23-nf] .' For so shall we remain partakers of Christ[fn-89-P8944_3275323:24-nf] , if we hold fast to the end the Spirit given at the beginning. For he said, `Quench not;' not because the Spirit is placed in the power of men, and is able to suffer anything from them; but because bad and unthankful men are such as manifestly wish to quench it, since they, like the impure, persecute the Spirit with unholy deeds. `For the holy Spirit of discipline will flee deceit, nor dwell in a body that is subject unto sin; but will remove from thoughts that are without understanding[fn-89-P8945_3275929:25-nf] .'

Thus, for instance, those who were with Cleopas[fn-89-P8951_3276939:31-nf] , although infirm at first from lack of knowledge, yet afterwards were inflamed with the words of the Saviour, and brought forth the fruits of the knowledge of Him.
