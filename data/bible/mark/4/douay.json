{"verses":["And again he began to teach by the sea side; and a great multitude\nwas gathered together unto him, so that he went up into a ship and sat\nin the sea:  and all the multitude was upon the land by the sea side.","And he taught them many things in parables, and said unto them in\nhis doctrine:","Hear ye:  Behold, the sower went out to sow.","And whilst he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the birds of\nthe air came and ate it up.","And other some fell upon stony ground, where it had not much\nearth; and it shot up immediately, because it had no depth of earth.","And when the sun was risen, it was scorched; and because it had no\nroot, it withered away.","And some fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up, and choked it,\nand it yielded no fruit.","And some fell upon good ground; and brought forth fruit that grew\nup, and increased and yielded, one thirty, another sixty, and another a\nhundred.","And he said:  He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.","And when he was alone, the twelve that were with him asked him\nthe parable.","And he said to them:  To you it is given to know the mystery of\nthe kingdom of God:  but to them that are without, all things are done\nin parables:","That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may\nhear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted,\nand their sins should be forgiven them.","And he saith to them:  Are you ignorant of this, parable?  and how\nshall you know all parables?","He that soweth, soweth the word.","And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown, and\nas soon as they have heard, immediately Satan cometh and taketh away\nthe word that was sown in their hearts.","And these likewise are they that are sown on the stony ground:\nwho when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy.","And they have no root in themselves, but are only for a time:  and\nthen when tribulation and persecution ariseth for the word they are\npresently scandalized.","And others there are who are sown among thorns:  these are they\nthat hear the word,","And the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and\nthe lusts after other things entering in choke the word, and it is made\nfruitless.","And these are they who are sown upon the good ground, who hear\nthe word, and receive it, and yield fruit, the one thirty, another\nsixty, and another a hundred.","And he said to them:  Doth a candle come in to be put under a\nbushel, or under a bed?  and not to be set on a candlestick?","For there is nothing hid, which shall not be made manifest:\nneither was it made secret, but that it may come abroad.","If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.","And he said to them:  Take heed what you hear.  In what measure you\nshall mete, it shall be measured to you again, and more shall be given\nto you.","For he that hath, to him shall be given:  and he that hath not,\nthat also which he hath shall be taken away from him.","And he said:  So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast\nseed into the earth,","And should sleep, and rise, night and day, and the seed should\nspring, and grow up whilst he knoweth not.","For the earth of itself bringeth forth fruit, first the blade,\nthen the ear, afterwards the full corn in the ear.","And when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in\nthe sickle, because the harvest is come.","And he said:  To what shall we liken the kingdom of God?  or to\nwhat parable shall we compare it?","It is as a grain of mustard seed:  which when it is sown in the\nearth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth:","And when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all\nherbs, and shooteth out great branches, so that the birds of the air\nmay dwell under the shadow thereof.","And with many such parables, he spoke to them the word, according\nas they were able to hear.","And without parable he did not speak unto them; but apart, he\nexplained all things to his disciples.","And he saith to them that day, when evening was come:  Let us pass\nover to the other side.","And sending away the multitude, they take him even as he was in\nthe ship:  and there were other ships with him.","And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into\nthe ship, so that the ship was filled.","And he was in the hinder part of the ship, sleeping upon a\npillow; and they awake him, and say to him:  Master, doth, it not\nconcern thee that we perish?","And rising up, he rebuked the wind, and said to the sea:  Peace,\nbe still.  And the wind ceased:  and there was made a great calm.","And he said to them:  Why are you fearful?  have you not faith yet?\nAnd they feared exceedingly:  and they said one to another:  Who is this\n(thinkest thou) that both wind and sea obey him?"]}
