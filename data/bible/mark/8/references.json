The old law had a different ideal of blessedness, for therein it is said: \"Blessed is he who hath seed in Zion and a family in Jerusalem:\"[fn-7-P758_151979:480-nf] and \"Cursed is the barren who beareth not:\"[fn-7-P759_152049:481-nf] and \"Thy children shall be like olive-plants round about thy table.\"[fn-7-P760_152147:482-nf] Riches too are promised to the faithful and we are told that \"there was not one feeble person among their tribes.\"[fn-7-P761_152285:483-nf] But now even to eunuchs it is said, \"Say not, behold I am a dry tree,\"[fn-7-P762_152375:484-nf] for instead of sons and daughters you have a place forever in heaven. Now the poor are blessed, now Lazarus is set before Dives in his purple.[fn-7-P763_152538:485-nf] Now he who is weak is counted strong. But in those days the world was still unpeopled: accordingly, to pass over instances of childlessness meant only to serve as types, those only were considered happy who could boast of children. It was for this reason that Abraham in his old age married Keturah;[fn-7-P764_152867:486-nf] that Leah hired Jacob with her son's mandrakes,[fn-7-P765_152935:487-nf] and that fair Rachel-a type of the church-complained of the closing of her womb.[fn-7-P766_153040:488-nf] But gradually the crop grew up and then the reaper was sent forth with his sickle. Elijah lived a virgin life, so also did Elisha and many of the sons of the prophets. To Jeremiah the command came: \"Thou shall not take thee a wife.\"[fn-7-P767_153306:489-nf] He had been sanctified in his mother's womb,[fn-7-P768_153371:490-nf] and now he was forbidden to take a wife because the captivity was near. The apostle gives the same counsel in different words. \"I think, therefore, that this is good by reason of the present distress, namely that it is good for a man to be as he is.\"[fn-7-P769_153640:491-nf] What is this distress which does away with the joys of wedlock? The apostle tells us, in a later verse: \"The time is short: it remaineth that those who have wives be as though they had none.\"[fn-7-P770_153860:492-nf] Nebuchadnezzar is hard at hand. The lion is bestirring himself from his lair. What good will marriage be to me if it is to end in slavery to the haughtiest of kings? What good will little ones be to me if their lot is to be that which the prophet sadly describes: \"The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst; the young children ask for bread and no man breaketh it unto them\"?[fn-7-P771_154294:493-nf] In those days, as I have said, the virtue of continence was found only in men: Eve still continued to travail with children. But now that a virgin has conceived[fn-7-P772_154474:494-nf] in the womb and has borne to us a child of which the prophet says that \"Government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called the mighty God, the everlasting Father,\"[fn-7-P773_154676:495-nf] now the chain of the curse is broken. Death came through Eve, but life has come through Mary. And thus the gift of virginity has been bestowed most richly upon women, seeing that it has had its beginning from a woman. As soon as the Son of God set foot upon the earth, He formed for Himself a new household there; that, as He was adored by angels in heaven, angels might serve Him also on earth. Then chaste Judith once more cut off the head of Holofernes.[fn-7-P774_155152:496-nf] Then Haman-whose name means iniquity-was once more burned in fire of his own kindling.[fn-7-P775_155260:497-nf] Then James and John forsook father and net and ship and followed the Saviour: neither kinship nor the world's ties, nor the care of their home could hold them back. Then were the words heard: \"Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.\"[fn-7-P776_155565:498-nf] For no soldier goes with a wife to battle. Even when a disciple would have buried his father, the Lord forbade him, and said: \"Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man hath not where to lay His head.\"[fn-7-P777_155820:499-nf] So you must not complain if you have but scanty house-room.

For if he uses such expressions with reference to vain idols and to the erroneous conceptions of those who worship them (even as Paul assures us that there is no agreement between Christ and Belial, and no fellowship between the temple of God and idols[fn-10-P1017_548895:49-nf] ) we agree with him. But if by these assertions he means to sever the Only-begotten God from the Godhead of the Father, let him be informed that he is providing us with a dilemma that may be turned against himself to refute his own impiety. For either he denies the Only-begotten God to be God at all, that he may preserve for the Father those prerogatives of deity which (according to him) are incapable of being shared with the Son, and thus is convicted as a transgressor by denying the God Whom Christians worship, or if he were to grant that the Son also is God, yet not agreeing in nature with the true God, he would be necessarily obliged to acknowledge that he maintains Gods sundered from one another by the difference of their natures. Let him choose which of these he will,-either to deny the Godhead of the Son, or to introduce into his creed a plurality of Gods. For whichever of these he chooses, it is all one as regards impiety: for we who are initiated intothe mystery of godliness by the Divinely inspired words of the Scripture do not see between the Father and the Son a partnership of Godhead, but unity, inasmuch as the Lord hath taught us this by His own words, when He saith, \"I and the Father are one[fn-10-P1018_550159:50-nf] ,\" and \"he that hath seen Me hath seen the Father[fn-10-P1019_550229:51-nf] .\" For if He were not of the same nature as the Father, how could He either have had in Himself that which was different[fn-10-P1020_550371:52-nf] ? or how could He have shown in Himself that which was unlike, if the foreign and alien nature did not receive the stamp of that which was of a different kind from itself? But he says, \"nor has He a divider of His glory.\" Herein he speaks in accordance with the fact, even though he does not know what he is saying: for the Son does not divide the glory with the Father, but has the glory of the Father in its entirety, even as the Father has all the glory of the Son. For thus He spake to the Father \"All Mine are Thine and Thine are Mine[fn-10-P1021_550934:53-nf] .\" Wherefore also He says that He will appear on the Judgment Day \"in the glory of the Father[fn-10-P1022_551051:54-nf] ,\" when He will render to every man according to his works. And by this phrase He shows the unity of nature that subsists between them. For as \"there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon[fn-10-P1023_551278:55-nf] ,\" because of the difference between the natures of those luminaries (since if both had the same glory there would not be deemed to be any difference in their nature), so He Who foretold of Himself that He would appear in the glory of the Father indicated by the identity of glory their community of nature.","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":8,"verse":38,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"57","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Why should I pursue this part of the subject in more detail? For the words preceding also are tainted with the same profanity-\"receiving glory from the Father, not sharing glory with the Father, for the glory of the Almighty God is incommunicable.\" For my own part, even had his words referred to Moses who was glorified in the ministration of the Law,-not even then should I have tolerated such a statement, even if it be conceded that Moses, having no glory from within, appeared completely glorious to the Israelites by the favour bestowed on him from God. For the very glory that was bestowed on the lawgiver was the glory of none other but of God Himself, which glory the Lord in the Gospel bids all to seek, when He blames those who value human glory highly and seek not the glory that cometh from God only[fn-11-P1136_615427:142-nf] . For by the fact that He commanded them to seek the glory that cometh from the only God, He declared the possibility of their obtaining what they sought. How then is the glory of the Almighty incommunicable, if it is even our duty to ask for the glory that cometh from the only God, and if, according to our Lord's word, \"every one that asketh receiveth[fn-11-P1137_615808:143-nf] ?\" But one who says concerning the Brightness of the Father's glory, that He has the glory by having received it, says in effect that the Brightness of the glory is in Itself devoid of glory, and needs, in order to become Himself at last the Lord of some glory, to receive glory from another. How then are we to dispose of the utterances of the Truth,-one which tells us that He shall be seen in the glory of the Father[fn-11-P1138_616252:144-nf] , and another which says, \"All things that the Father hath are Mine[fn-11-P1139_616345:145-nf] \"? To whom ought the hearer to give ear? To him who says, \"He that is, as the Apostle says, the `heir of all things[fn-11-P1140_616485:146-nf] ' that are in the Father, is without part or lot in His Father's glory\"; or to Him Who declares that all things that the Father hath, He Himself hath also? Now among the \"all things,\" glory surely is included. Yet Eunomius says that the glory of the Almighty is incommunicable. This view Joel does not attest, nor yet the mighty Peter, who adopted, in his speech to the Jews, the language of the prophet. For both the prophet and the apostle say, in the person of God,-\"I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh[fn-11-P1141_617017:147-nf] .\" He then Who did not grudge the partaking in His own Spirit to all flesh,-how can it be that He does not impart His own glory to the only-begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, Who has all things that the Father has? Perhaps one should say that Eunomius is here speaking the truth, though not intending it. For the term \"impart\" is strictly used in the case of one who has not his glory from within, whose possession of it is an accession from without, and not part of his own nature: but where one and the same nature is observed in both Persons, He Who is as regards nature all that the Father is believed to be stands in no need of one to impart to Him each several attribute. This it will be well to explain more clearly and precisely.

Note that He did not place first His Father's divine majesty, and then, in the second place, His own and the angels', lest He should seem to have made out a sort of descending order, from the highest to lower natures. He placed His own majesty first, and then spoke of His Father's, and the majesty of the angels (because the Father could not appear lower than they), in order that He might not, by placing mention of Himself between that of His Father and that of the angels, seem to have made out some ascending scale, leading from angels to the Father through increase of His own dignity; nor, again, be believed to have, contrariwise, shown a descent from the Father to angels, entailing diminution of that dignity.

We have said above that He might possibly have undergone the unreal mockeries[fn-93-P9321_2558783:66-nf] of an imaginary birth and infancy. But answer me at once, you that murder truth: Was not God really crucified? And, having been really crucified, did He not really die? And, having indeed really died, did He not really rise again? Falsely did Paul[fn-93-P9322_2559052:67-nf] \"determine to know nothing amongst us but Jesus and Him crucified; \"[fn-93-P9323_2559175:68-nf] falsely has he impressed upon us that He was buried; falsely inculcated that He rose again. False, therefore, is our faith also. And all that we hope for from Christ will be a phantom. O thou most infamous of men, who acquittest of all guilt[fn-93-P9324_2559436:69-nf] the murderers of God! For nothing did Christ suffer from them, if He really suffered nothing at all. Spare the whole world's one only hope, thou who art destroying the indispensable dishonour of our faith[fn-93-P9325_2559655:70-nf] Whatsoever is unworthy of God, is of gain to me.

And the Son of God died; it is by all means to be believed, because it is absurd.[fn-93-P9327_2560280:72-nf] And He was buried, and rose again; the fact is certain, because it is impossible. But how will all this be true in Him, if He was not Himself true-if He really had not in Himself that which might be crucified, might die, might be buried, and might rise again? I mean this flesh suffused with blood, built up with bones, interwoven with nerves, entwined with veins, a flesh which knew how to be born, and how to die, human without doubt, as born of a human being. It will therefore be mortal in Christ, because Christ is man and the Son of man. Else why is Christ man and the Son of man, if he has nothing of man, and nothing from man? Unless it be either that man is anything else than flesh, or man's flesh comes from any other source than man, or Mary is anything else than a human being, or Marcion's man is as Marcion's god.[fn-93-P9328_2561123:73-nf] Otherwise Christ could not be described as being man without flesh, nor the Son of man without any human parent; just as He is not God without the Spirit of God, nor the Son of God without having God for His father. Thus the nature[fn-93-P9329_2561391:74-nf] of the two substances displayed Him as man and God,-in one respect born, in the other unborn; l in one respect fleshly in the other spiritual; in one sense weak in the other exceeding strong; in on sense dying, in the other living. This property of the two states-the divine and the human-is distinctly asserted[fn-93-P9330_2561730:75-nf] with equal truth of both natures alike, with the same belief both in respect of the Spirit[fn-93-P9331_2561841:76-nf] and of the flesh. The powers of the Spirit,[fn-93-P9332_2562045:77-nf] proved Him to be God, His sufferings attested the flesh of man. If His powers were not without the Spirit[fn-93-P9333_2562311:78-nf] in like manner, were not His sufferings without the flesh. if His flesh with its sufferings was fictitious, for the same reason was the Spirit false with all its powers. Wherefore halve[fn-93-P9334_2562657:79-nf] Christ with a lie? He was wholly the truth. Believe me, He chose rather to be born, than in any part to pretend-and that indeed to His own detriment-that He was bearing about a flesh hardened without bones, solid without muscles, bloody without blood, clothed without the tunic of skin,[fn-93-P9335_2562960:80-nf] hungry without appetite, eating without teeth, speaking without a tongue, so that His word was a phantom to the ears through an imaginary voice. A phantom, too, it was of course after the resurrection, when, showing His hands and His feet for the disciples to examine, He said, \"Behold and see that it is I myself, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have; \"[fn-93-P9336_2563373:81-nf] without doubt, hands, and feet, and bones are not what a spirit possesses, but only the flesh.

But for the majority, I take it, who live all their lives with such obtuse faculties of thinking, it is a difficult thing to perform this feat of mental analysis and of discriminating the material vehicle from the immanent beauty, and thereby of grasping the actual nature of the Beautiful; and if any one wants to know the exact source of all the false and pernicious conceptions of it, he would find it in nothing else but this, viz. the absence, in the soul's faculties of feeling, of that exact training which would enable them to distinguish between true Beauty and the reverse. Owing to this men give up all search after the true Beauty. Some slide into mere sensuality. Others incline in their desires to dead metallic coin. Others limit their imagination of the beautiful to worldly honours, fame, and power. There is another class which is enthusiastic about art and science.

But he who turns from all grosser thoughts and all passionate longings after what is seeming, and explores the nature of the beauty which is simple, immaterial, formless, would never make a mistake like that when he has to choose between all the objects of desire; he would never be so misled by these attractions as not to see the transient character of their pleasures and not to win his way to an utter contempt for every one of them. This, then, is the path to lead us to the discovery of the Beautiful. All other objects that attract men's love, be they never so fashionable, be they prized never so much and embraced never so eagerly, must be left below us, as too low, too fleeting, to employ the powers of loving which we possess; not indeed that those powers are to be locked up within us unused and motionless; but only that they must first be cleansed from all lower longings; then we must lift them to that height to which sense can never reach. Admiration even of the beauty of the heavens, and of the dazzling sunbeams, and, indeed, of any fair phenomenon, will then cease. The beauty noticed there will be but as the hand to lead us to the love of the supernal Beauty whose glory the heavens and the firmament declare, and whose secret the whole creation sings. The climbing soul, leaving all that she has grasped already as too narrow for her needs, will thus grasp the idea of that magnificence which is exalted far above the heavens. But how can any one reach to this, whose ambitions creep below? How can any one fly up into the heavens, who has not the wings of heaven and is not already buoyant and lofty-minded by reason of a heavenly calling?

He therefore who keeps away from all bitterness and all the noisome effluvia of the flesh, and raises himself on the aforesaid wings above all low earthly ambitions, or, more than that, above the whole universe itself, will be the man to find that which is alone worth loving, and to become himself as beautiful as the Beauty which he has touched and entered, and to be made bright and luminous himself in the communion of the real Light. We are told by those who have studied the subject, that those gleams which follow each other so fast through the air at night and which some call shooting stars[fn-27-P2741_1870214:61-nf] , are nothing but the air itself streaming into the upper regions of the sky under stress of some particular blasts.

Did He then wish them when they were already discharging the function of Apostles to proclaim that He was the Christ? For, if He wished it, it is fitting to inquire why He now at all commands the disciples that they should not say that He was the Christ? Or if He did not wish it, how can the things concerning the apostleship be safely maintained? And these things also one may inquire at this place,-whether, when He sent away the Twelve, He did not send them away with the understanding that He was the Christ? But if the Twelve had such understanding, manifestly Peter had it also; how, then, is he now pronounced blessed? For the expression here plainly indicates that now for the first time Peter confessed that Christ was the Son of the living God, Matthew then, according to some of the manuscripts, has written, \"Then He commanded His disciples that they should tell no man that He was the Christ,\" but[fn-79-P7963_1697047:111-nf] Mark says, \"He charged them that they should tell no man of Him; \"[fn-79-P7964_1697136:112-nf] and Luke, \"He charged them and commanded them to tell this to no man.\"[fn-79-P7965_1697229:113-nf] But what is the \"this\"? Was it that also according to him, Peter answered and said to the question, \"Who say ye that I am.\"-\"The Christ, the Son of the living God? \"[fn-79-P7966_1697415:114-nf] You must know, however, that some manuscripts of the Gospel according to Matthew have, \"He charged.\"[fn-79-P7967_1697542:115-nf] The difficulty thus started seems to me a very real difficulty; but let a solution which cannot be impugned be sought out, and let the finder of it bring it forward before all, if it be more credible than that which shall be advanced by us as a fairly temperate view.[fn-79-P7968_1697832:116-nf] Consider, then, if you can say, that the belief that Jesus is the Christ is inferior to the knowledge of that which is believed. And perhaps also there is a difference in the knowledge of Jesus as the Christ, as every one who knows does not know Him alike. From the words in John, \"If ye abide in My word, ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free,\"[fn-79-P7969_1698243:117-nf] it is plain that belief without knowledge is inferior to knowing; but that there is a difference in the knowledge of Jesus as the Christ, as all who know Him do not know Him equally, is a fact self-evident to any one who gives even a very little consideration to the matter. For who would not acknowledge, for example, that Timothy, though he knew that Jesus was the Christ, had not been enlightened to such an extent in the knowledge of Him as the Apostle had been enlightened? And who would not also admit this-that though many, speaking the truth, say about God, \"He has given to me a true knowledge of things that are,\" yet they will not say this with equal insight and apprehension of the things known, nor as knowing the same number of things? But it is not only in respect of the difference of knowing that those who know do not know alike, bat also according to that which is the source of the knowledge; so that according to this he who knows the Son by the revelation of the Father,[fn-79-P7970_1699263:118-nf] as Peter is testified to have known, has the highest beatitude. Now, if these views of ours are sound, you will consider whether the Twelve formerly believed but did not know; but, after believing, they gained also the rudiments of knowledge and knew a few things about Him; and afterwards they continued to advance in knowledge so that they were able to receive the knowledge from the Father who reveals the Son; in which position Peter was, when he was pronounced blessed; for also he is pronounced blessed not merely because he said, \"Thou art the Christ,\" but with the addition, \"the Son of the living God.\" Accordingly Mark and Luke who have recorded that Peter answered and said, \"Thou art the Christ,\" but have not given the addition found in Matthew, have not recorded that he was declared blessed for what had been said, nor the blessing which followed the declaration of blessedness, \"Thou art Peter,\"[fn-79-P7971_1700197:119-nf] etc.","title":"Book XII."},{"chapter":8,"verse":31,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_60_book_iii_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"118","folder":"ANF-01","text":"5.

If, then, the veil is taken away which is put on in that reading of theirs, they will understand the true virtue of the circumcision; and they will also discover that the generation of Him whom we preach, and His cross, and all the things that have happened in the history of our Lord, are those very matters which had been predicted of that Prophet. And I could wish, indeed, to examine every such passage of Scripture by itself, and to point out its import, as it is meet that it should be understood.[fn-38-P3801_1069948:517-nf] But as it is another subject that is now urgent, these passages shall be discussed by us at some season of leisure. For at present, what I have already said may be sufficient for the purpose of showing, that it is not without reason that the veil is (said to be) put upon the heart of certain persons in the reading of the Old Testament. But those who turn to the Lordsh all have the veil taken away from them. What precise force all these things, however, may possess, I leave to the apprehension of those who have sound intelligence. Let us come now again to that word of Moses, in which he says: \"The Lord your God shall raise up a Prophet unto you, of your brethren, like unto me.\" In this saying I perceive a great prophecy delivered by the servant Moses, as by one cognizant[fn-38-P3802_1070879:518-nf] that He who is to come is indeed to be possessed of greater authority than himself, and nevertheless is to suffer like things with him, and to show like signs and wonders.

There, Moses smote down with the sword those who had set up the calf;[fn-38-P3818_1073338:534-nf] and here, the Lord Jesus said, \"I came to send a sword upon the earth, and to set a man at variance with his neighbour,\"[fn-38-P3819_1073477:535-nf] and so on. There, Moses went without fear into the darkness of the clouds that carry water;[fn-38-P3820_1073589:536-nf] and here, the Lord Jesus walked with all power upon the waters.[fn-38-P3821_1073674:537-nf] There, Moses gave his commands to the sea;[fn-38-P3822_1073739:538-nf] and here, the Lord Jesus, when he was on the sea,[fn-38-P3823_1073805:539-nf] rose and gave His commands to the winds and the sea.[fn-38-P3824_1073933:540-nf] There, Moses, when he was assailed, stretched forth his hands and fought against Amalek;[fn-38-P3825_1074045:541-nf] and here, the Lord Jesus, when we were assailed and were perishing by the violence of that erring spirit who works now hi the just,[fn-38-P3826_1074194:542-nf] stretched forth His hands upon the cross, and gave us salvation.
