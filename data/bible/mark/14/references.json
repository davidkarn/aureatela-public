The same truths are also confirmed by him in the epistle to the Hebrews[fn-17-P1701_731004:96-nf] in these words: `For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.' Neither the apostles, therefore, nor the Gospels,[fn-17-P1702_731178:97-nf] have anywhere imposed the `yoke of servitude'[fn-17-P1703_731406:98-nf] on those who have embraced the truth; but have left Easter and every other feast to be honored by the gratitude of the recipients of grace. Wherefore, inasmuch as men love festivals, because they afford them cessation from labor: each individual in every place, according to his own pleasure, has by a prevalent custom celebrated the memory of the saving passion. The Saviour and his apostles have enjoined us by no law to keep this feast: nor do the Gospels and apostles threaten us with any penalty, punishment, or curse for the neglect of it, as the Mosaic law does the Jews.

So also the feast of Easter came to be observed in each place according to the individual peculiarities of the peoples inasmuch as none of the apostles legislated on the matter. And that the observance originated not by legislation, but as a custom the facts themselves indicate. In Asia Minor most people kept the fourteenth day of the moon, disregarding the sabbath: yet they never separated from those who did otherwise, until Victor, bishop of Rome, influenced by too ardent a zeal, fulminated a sentence of excommunication against the Quartodecimans[fn-17-P1705_733067:100-nf] in Asia. Wherefore also Irenaeus, bishop of Lyons in France, severely censured Victor by letter for his immoderate heat;[fn-17-P1706_733504:101-nf] telling him that although the ancients differed in their celebration of Easter, they did not desist from intercommunion. Also that Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna, who afterwards suffered martyrdom under Gordian,[fn-17-P1707_733746:102-nf] continued to communicate with Anicetus bishop of Rome, although he himself, according to the usage of his native Smyrna, kept Easter on the fourteenth day of the moon, as Eusebius attests in the fifth book of his Ecclesiastical History.[fn-17-P1708_734474:103-nf] While therefore some in Asia Minor observed the day above-mentioned, others in the East kept that feast on the sabbath indeed, but differed as regards the month. The former thought the Jews should be followed, though they were not exact: the latter kept Easter after the equinox, refusing to celebrate with the Jews; `for,' said they, `it ought to be celebrated when the sun is in Aries, in the month called Xanthicus by the Antiochians, and April by the Romans.' In this practice, they averred, they conformed not to the modern Jews, who are mistaken in almost everything, but to the ancients, and to Josephus according to what he has written in the third book of his Jewish Antiquities.[fn-17-P1709_735184:104-nf] Thus these people were at issue among themselves.

In Asia Minor most people kept the fourteenth day of the moon, disregarding the sabbath: yet they never separated from those who did otherwise, until Victor, bishop of Rome, influenced by too ardent a zeal, fulminated a sentence of excommunication against the Quartodecimans[fn-17-P1705_733067:100-nf] in Asia. Wherefore also Irenaeus, bishop of Lyons in France, severely censured Victor by letter for his immoderate heat;[fn-17-P1706_733504:101-nf] telling him that although the ancients differed in their celebration of Easter, they did not desist from intercommunion. Also that Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna, who afterwards suffered martyrdom under Gordian,[fn-17-P1707_733746:102-nf] continued to communicate with Anicetus bishop of Rome, although he himself, according to the usage of his native Smyrna, kept Easter on the fourteenth day of the moon, as Eusebius attests in the fifth book of his Ecclesiastical History.[fn-17-P1708_734474:103-nf] While therefore some in Asia Minor observed the day above-mentioned, others in the East kept that feast on the sabbath indeed, but differed as regards the month. The former thought the Jews should be followed, though they were not exact: the latter kept Easter after the equinox, refusing to celebrate with the Jews; `for,' said they, `it ought to be celebrated when the sun is in Aries, in the month called Xanthicus by the Antiochians, and April by the Romans.' In this practice, they averred, they conformed not to the modern Jews, who are mistaken in almost everything, but to the ancients, and to Josephus according to what he has written in the third book of his Jewish Antiquities.[fn-17-P1709_735184:104-nf] Thus these people were at issue among themselves. But all other Christians in the Western parts, and as far as the ocean itself, are found to have celebrated Easter after the equinox, from a very ancient tradition. And in fact these acting in this manner have never disagreed on this subject. It is not true, as some have pretended, that the Synod under Constantine altered this festival:[fn-17-P1710_736069:105-nf] for Constantine himself, writing to those who differed respecting it, recommended that as they were few in number, they could agree with the majority of their brethren. His letter will be found at length in the third book of the Life of Constantine by Eusebius; but the passage in it relative to Easter runs thus:[fn-17-P1711_736472:106-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Socrates Scholasticus"},{"chapter":14,"verse":31,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_10_lecture_v_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"14","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"7.

If you will not learn Who Christ is from those that know Him, learn it at least from those that know Him not. So shall the confession, which their ignorance is forced to make, rebuke your blasphemy. The Jews did not recognise Christ, come in the body, though they knew that the true Christ must be the Son of God. And so, when they were employing false witnesses, without one word of truth in their testimony, against Him, their priest asked Him, Art Thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed[fn-15-P1506_954605:68-nf] ? They knew not that in Him the mystery was fulfilled; they knew that the Divine nature was the condition of its fulfilment. They did not ask whether Christ be the Son of God; they asked whether He were Christ, the Son of God. They were wrong as to the Person, not as to the Sonship, of Christ. They did not doubt that Christ is the Son of God; and thus, while they asked whether He were the Christ, they asked without denying that the Christ is the Son of God. What, then, of your faith, which leads you to deny what even they, in their blindness, confessed? The perfect knowledge is this, to be assured that Christ, the Son of God, Who existed before the worlds, was also born of the Virgin. Even they, who know nothing of His birth from Mary, know that He is the Son of God. Mark the fellowship with Jewish wickedness in which your denial of the Divine Sonship has involved you! For they have put on record the reason of their condemnation:-And by our Law He ought to die, because He made Himself the Son of God[fn-15-P1507_955643:69-nf] . Is not this the same charge which you are blasphemously bringing against Him, that, while you pronounce Him a creature, He calls Himself the Son? He confesses Himself the Son, and they declare Him guilty of death: you too deny that He is the Son of God. What sentence do you pass upon Him? You have the same repugnance to His claim as had the Jews. You agree with their verdict; I want to know whether you will quarrel about the sentence. Your offence, in denying that He is the Son of God, is exactly the same as theirs, though their guilt is less, for they sinned in ignorance. They knew not that Christ was born of Mary, yet they never doubted that Christ must be the Son of God. You are perfectly aware of the fact that Christ was born of Mary, yet you refuse Him the name of Son of God. If they come to the faith, there awaits them an un-imperilled salvation, because of their past ignorance. Every gate of safety is shut to you, because you persist in denying a truth which is obvious to you. For you are not ignorant that He is the Son of God; you know it so well that you allow Him the name as a title of adoption, and feign that He is a creature adorned, like others, with the right to call Himself a Son. You rob Him, as far as you can, of the Divine nature; if you could, you would rob Him of the Divine name as well. But, because you cannot, you divorce the name from the nature; He is called a Son, but He shall not be the true Son of God.","title":"Book VI.","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":14,"verse":21,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_24_the_prescription_against_heretics_","source_chapter":32,"source_paragraph":"109","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Where was Marcion then, that shipmaster of Pontus, the zealous student of Stoicism? Where was Valentinus then, the disciple of Platonism? For it is evident that those men lived not so long ago,-in the reign of Antoninus for the most part,[fn-35-P3526_1204752:307-nf] -and that they at first were believers in the doctrine of the Catholic Church, in the church of Rome under the episcopate of the blessed Eleutherus,[fn-35-P3527_1204914:308-nf] until on account of their ever restless curiosity, with which they even infected the brethren, they were more than once expelled. Marcion, indeed, [went] with the two hundred sesterces which which he had brought into the church, and,[fn-35-P3528_1205171:309-nf] when banished at last to a permanent excommunication, they scattered abroad the poisons of their doctrines. Afterwards, it is true, Marcion professed repentance, and agreed to the conditions granted to him-that he should receive reconciliation if he restored to the church all the others whom he had been training for perdition: he was prevented, however, by death. It was indeed[fn-35-P3529_1205589:310-nf] necessary that there should be heresies;[fn-35-P3530_1205662:311-nf] and yet it does not follow from that necessity, that heresies are a good thing. As if it has not been necessary also that there should be evil! It was even necessary that the Lord should be betrayed; but woe to the traitor![fn-35-P3531_1205908:312-nf] So that no man may from this defend heresies. If we must likewise touch the descent[fn-35-P3532_1206014:313-nf] of Apelles, he is far from being\" one of the old school,\"[fn-35-P3533_1206162:314-nf] like his instructor and moulder, Marcion; he rather forsook the continence of Marcion, by resorting to the company of a woman, and withdrew to Alexandria, out of sight of his most abstemious[fn-35-P3534_1206367:315-nf] master. Returning therefrom, after some years, unimproved, except that he was no longer a Marcionite, he clave[fn-35-P3535_1206569:316-nf] to another woman, the maiden Philumene (whom we have already[fn-35-P3536_1206646:317-nf] mentioned), who herself afterwards became an enormous prostitute. Having been imposed on by her vigorous spirit,[fn-35-P3537_1206793:318-nf] he committed to writing the revelations which he had learned of her. Persons are still living who remember them,-their own actual disciples and successors,-who cannot therefore deny the lateness of their date. But, in fact, by their own works they are convicted, even as the Lord said.[fn-35-P3538_1207211:319-nf] For since Marcion separated the New Testament from the Old, he is (necessarily) subsequent to that which he separated, inasmuch as it was only in his power to separate what was (previously) united. Having then been united previous to its separation, the fact of its subsequent separation proves the subsequence also of the man who effected the separation. In like manner Valentinus, by his different expositions and acknowledged[fn-35-P3539_1207662:320-nf] emendations, makes these changes on the express ground of previous faultiness, and therefore demonstrates the difference[fn-35-P3540_1207802:321-nf] of the documents. These corrupters of the truth we mention as being more notorious and more public[fn-35-P3541_1208007:322-nf] than others. There is, however, a certain man[fn-35-P3542_1208075:323-nf] named Nigidius, and Hermogenes, and several others, who still pursue the course[fn-35-P3543_1208174:324-nf] of perverting the ways of the Lord. Let them show me by what authority they come! If it be some other God they preach, how comes it that they employ the things and he writings and the names of that God against whom they preach? If it be the same God, why treat Him in some other way? Let them prove themselves to be new apostles![fn-35-P3544_1208521:325-nf] Let them maintain that Christ has come down a second time, taught in person a second time, has been twice crucified, twice dead, twice raised! For thus has the apostle described (the order of events in the life of Christ); for thus, too, is He[fn-35-P3545_1208825:326-nf] accustomed to make His apostles-to give them, (that is), power besides of working the same miracles which He worked Himself.[fn-35-P3546_1208975:327-nf] I would therefore have their mighty deeds also brought forward; except that I allow their mightiest deed to be that by which they perversely vie with the apostles.

For the word of the Scripture says that in regard to one person two things were wrought,-by the Jews, the Passion, and by God, honour; not as though one person had suffered and another had been honoured by exaltation: and he further explains this yet more clearly by his words in what follows, \"being exalted by the right hand of God.\" Who then was \"exalted\"? He that was lowly, or He that was the Highest? and what else is the lowly, but the Humanity? what else is the Highest, but the Divinity? Surely, God needs not to be exalted, seeing that He is the Highest. It follows, then, that the Apostle's meaning is that the Humanity was exalted: and its exaltation was effected by its becoming Lord and Christ. And this took place after the Passion.[fn-16-P1625_935230:38-nf] It is not therefore the pre-temporal existence of the Lord which the Apostle indicates by the word \"made,\" but that change of the lowly to the lofty which was effected \"by the right hand of God.\" Even by this phrase is declared the mystery of godliness; for he who says \"exalted by the right hand of God\" manifestly reveals the unspeakable dispensation of this mystery, that the Right. Hand of God, that made all things that are, (which is the Lord, by Whom all things were made, and without Whom nothing that is subsists,) Itself raised to Its own height the Man united with It, making Him also to be what It is by nature. Now It is Lord and King: Christ is the King's name: these things It made Him too. For as He was highly exalted by being in the Highest, so too He became all else,-Immortal in the Immortal, Light in the Light, Incorruptible in the Incorruptible, Invisible in the Invisible, Christ in the Christ, Lord in the Lord. For even in physical combinations. when one of the combined parts exceeds the other in a great degree, the inferior is wont to change completely to that which ismore potent. And this we are plainly taught by the voice of the Apostle Peter in his mystic discourse, that the lowly nature of Him Who was crucified through weakness, (and weakness, as we have heard from the Lord, marks the flesh[fn-16-P1626_937297:39-nf] ,) that lowly nature, I say, by virtue of its combination with the infinite and boundless element of good, remained no longer in its own measures and properties, but was by the Right Hand of God raised up together with Itself, and became Lord instead of servant, Christ a King instead of a subject, Highest instead of Lowly, God instead of man. What handle then against the saints did he who pretends to give warning against us in defence of the Apostles find in the material of our writings? Let us pass over this charge also in silence; for I think it a mean and unworthy thing to stand up against charges that are false and unfounded. Let us pass on to the more pressing part of his accusation.","title":"Book V","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":14,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_16_book_ix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"74","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"72. Far be it from us to imagine vicissitudes of bodily change in the Father and Son, as though the Father sometimes spoke to the Son, and sometimes was silent.

But the divine nature can dispense with the various combinations necessary for human functions, the motion of the tongue, the adjustment of the mouth, the forcing of the breath, and the vibration of the air. God is a simple Being: we must understand Him by devotion, and confess Him by reverence. He is to be worshipped, not pursued by our senses, for a conditioned and weak nature cannot grasp with the guesses of its imagination the mystery of an infinite and omnipotent nature. In God is no variability, no parts, as of a composite divinity, that in Him will should follow inaction, speech silence, or work rest, or that He should not will, without passing from some other mental state to volition, or speak, without breaking the silence with His voice, or act, without going forth to labour. He is not subject to the laws of nature, for nature has received its law from Him: He never suffers weakness or change when He acts, for His power is boundless, as the Lord said, Father, all things are possible unto Thee[fn-19-P1935_1270220:129-nf] . He can do more than human sense can conceive. The Lord does not deprive even Himself of the quality of omnipotence, for He says, What things soever the Father doeht, these the Son also doeth in like manner[fn-19-P1936_1270453:130-nf] .

That we may understand what was the cause of His sadness, let us see what precedes and follows this confession of sadness: for in the Passover supper our Lord completely signified the whole mystery of His Passion and our faith. After He had said that they should all be offended in Him[fn-20-P2044_1327532:54-nf] , but promised that He would go before them into Galilee[fn-20-P2045_1327654:55-nf] , Peter protested that though all the rest should be offended, he would remain faithful and not be offended[fn-20-P2046_1327817:56-nf] . But the Lord knowing by His Divine Nature what should come to pass, answered that Peter would deny Him thrice: that we might know from Peter how the others were offended, since even he lapsed into so great peril to his faith by the triple denial. After that, He took Peter, James and John, chosen, the first two to be His martyrs, John to be strengthened for the proclamation of the Gospel, and declared that He was sorrowful unto death. Then He went before, and prayed, saying, My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet, not as I will, but as Thou wilt[fn-20-P2047_1328417:57-nf] . He prays that the cup may pass from Him, when it was certainly already before Him: for even then was being fulfilled that pouting forth of His blood of the New Testament for the sins of many. He does not pray that it may not be with Him; but that it may pass away from Him. Then He prays that His wilt may not be done, and wills that what He wishes to be effected, may not be granted Him. For He says, Yet not as I will, but as Thou wilt: signifying by His spontaneous prayer for the cup's removal His fellowship with human anxiety, yet associating Himself with the decree of the Will which He shares inseparably with the Father. To shew, moreover, that He does not pray for Himself, and that He seeks only a conditional fulfilment of what He desires and prays for, He prefaces the whole of this request with the words, My Father, if it is possible. Is there anything for the Father the possibility of which is uncertain? But if nothing is impossible to the Father, we can see on what depends this condition, if it is possible[fn-20-P2048_1329508:58-nf] : for this prayer is immediately followed by the words, And He came to His disciples and findeth sleeping, and saith to Peter, Could ye not watch one hour with Me?

But to those who look into the matter without sufficient care, there may seem to be a contradiction involved in the fact that Matthew and Mark, after stating that the passover was to be after two days, have at once informed us how Jesus was in Bethany on that occasion, on which the account of the precious ointment comes before us; whereas John, when he is about to give us the same narrative concerning the ointment, begins by telling us that Jesus came to Bethany six days before the passover.[fn-21-P2195_920106:542-nf] Now, the question is, how the passover could be spoken of by those two evangelists as about to be celebrated two days after, seeing that we find them, immediately after they have made this statement, in company with John, giving us an account of the scene with the ointment in Bethany; while in that connection the last-named writer informs us, that the feast of the passover was to take place six days after. Nevertheless, those who are perplexed by this difficulty simply fail to perceive that Matthew and Mark have brought in their account of the scene which was enacted in Bethany really in the form of a recapitulation, not as if the time of its occurrence was actually subsequent to the [time indicated in the] announcement made by them on the subject of the two days' space, but as an event which had already taken place at a date when there was still a period of six days preceding the passover. For neither of them has appended his account of what took place at Bethany to his statement regarding the celebration of the passover after two days' space in any such terms as these: \"After these things, when He was in Bethany.\" But Matthew's phrase is this: \"Now when Jesus was in Bethany.\" And Mark's version is simply this: \"And being in Bethany,\" etc.; which is a method of expression that may certainly be taken to refer to a period antecedent to the utterance of what was said two days before the passover. The case, therefore, stands thus: As we gather from the narrative of John, Jesus came to Bethany six days before the passover; there the supper took place, in connection with which we get the account of the precious ointment; leaving this place, He came next to Jerusalem, sitting upon an ass; and thereafter happened those things which they relate to have occurred after this arrival of His in Jerusalem. Consequently, even although the evangelists do not mention the fact, we understand that between the day on which He came to Bethany, and which witnessed the scene with the ointment, and the day to which all these deeds and words which are at present before us belonged, there elapsed a period of four days, so that at this point might come in the day which the two evangelists have defined by their statement as to the celebration of the passover two days after. Further, when Luke says, \"Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh,\" he does not indeed make any express mention of a two days' space; but still, the nearness which he has instanced ought to be accepted as made good by this very space of two days. Again, when John makes the statement that \"the Jews' passover was nigh at hand,\"[fn-21-P2196_922745:543-nf] he does not intend a two days' space to be understood thereby, but means that there was a period of six days before the passover. Thus it is that, on recording certain matters immediately after this affirmation, with the intention of specifying what measure of nearness he had in view when he spoke of the passover as nigh at hand, he next proceeds in the following strain: \"Then Jesus, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus had died, whom Jesus raised from the dead;[fn-21-P2197_923256:544-nf] and there they made Him a supper.\"[fn-21-P2198_923348:545-nf] This is the incident which Matthew and Mark introduce in the form of a recapitulation, after the statement that after two days would be the passover. In their recapitulation they thus come back upon the day in Bethany, which was yet a six days' space off from the passover, and give us the account which John also gives of the supper and the ointment. Subsequently to that scene, we are to suppose Him to come to Jerusalem, and then, after the occurrence of the other things recorded, to reach this day, which was still a two days' space from the passover, and from which these evangelists have made this digression, with the object of giving a recapitulatory notice of the incident with the ointment in Bethany. And after the completion of that narrative, they return once more to the point from which they made the digression; that is to say, they now proceed to record the words spoken by the Lord two days before the passover. For if we remove the notice of the incident at Bethany, which they have introduced as a digression from the literal order, and have given in the form of a recollection and recapitulation inserted at a point subsequent to its actual historical position, and if we then set the narrative in its regular connection, the recital will go on as follows;-according to Matthew, the Lord's words coming in thus: \"Ye know that after two days shall be the feast of the passover, and the Son of man shall be betrayed to be crucified. Then assembled together the chief priests and the elders of the people unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, and consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill Him. But they said, Not on the feast-day, lest there be an uproar among the people. Then one of the twelve, called Judas Scarioth, went unto the chief priests,\"[fn-21-P2199_925180:546-nf] etc. For between the place where it is said, \"lest there be an uproar among the people,\" and the passage where we read, \"then one of the disciples, called Judas, went,\" etc., that notice of the scene at Bethany intervenes, which they have introduced by way of recapitulation. Consequently, by leaving it out, we have established such a connection in the narrative as may make our conclusion satisfactory, that there is no contradiction here in the matter of the order of times. Again, if we deal with Mark's Gospel in like manner, and omit the account of the same supper at Bethany, which he also has brought in as a recapitulation, his narrative will proceed in the following order: \"Now after two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take Him by craft, and put Him to death. For they said,[fn-22-P2200_926090:547-nf] Not on the feast-day, lest there be an uproar of the people. And Judas Scariothes, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray Him.\"[fn-22-P2201_926259:548-nf] Here, again, the incident at Bethany which these evangelists have inserted, by way of recapitulation, is placed between the clause, \"lest there be an uproar of the people,\" and the verse which we have attached immediately to that, namely, \"And Judas Scariothes, one of the twelve.\" Luke, on the other hand, has simply omitted the said occurrence at Bethany. This is the explanation which we give in reference to the six days before the passover, which is the space mentioned by John when narrating what took place at Bethany, and in reference to the two days before the passover, which is the period specified by Matthew and Mark when presenting their account, in direct sequence upon the statement thus made, of that same scene in Bethany which has been recorded also by John.[fn-22-P2202_927064:549-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":14,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":81,"source_paragraph":"319","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"154. Matthew, then, continuing his narrative from the point up to which we had concluded its examination, proceeds in the following terms: \"Then assembled together the chief priests and the elders of the people unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, and consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty and kill Him: but they said, Not on the feast-day, lest there be an uproar among the people.

For although Luke records an incident resembling this, and although the name which he assigns to the person in whose house the Lord was supping might also suggest an identity between the two narratives (for Luke likewise names the host \"Simon\"), still, since there is nothing either in nature or in the customs of men to make the case an incredible one, that as one man may have two names, two men may with all the greater likelihood have one and the same name, it is more reasonable to believe that the Simon in whose house [it is thus supposed, according to Luke's version, that] this scene at Bethany took place, was a different person from the Simon [named by Matthew]. For Luke, again, does not specify Bethany as the place where the incident which he records happened. And although it is true that he in no way particularizes the town or village in which that occurrence took place, still his narrative does not seem to deal with the same locality. Consequently, my opinion is, that there is but one interpretation to be put upon the matter. That is not, however, to suppose that the woman who appears in Matthew was an entirely different person from the woman who approached the feet of Jesus on that occasion in the character of a sinner, and kissed them, and washed them with her tears, and wiped them with her hair, and anointed them with ointment, in reference to whose case Jesus also made use of the parable of the two debtors, and said that her sins, which were many, were forgiven her because she loved much. But my theory is, that it was the same Mary who did this deed on two separate occasions, the one being that which Luke has put on record, when she approached Him first of all in that remarkable humility, and with those tears, and obtained the forgiveness of her sins.[fn-22-P2207_930173:551-nf] For John, too, although he has not given the kind of recital which Luke has left us of the circumstances connected with that incident, has at least mentioned the fact, in commending the same Mary to our notice, when he has just begun to tell the story of the raising of Lazarus, and before his narrative brings the Lord to Bethany itself.

And Matthew has expressed this by simply bringing in the phrase, \"to such a man,\" as a brief explanation introduced by himself with the view of succinctly giving us to understand who the person referred to was. For if he had said that the Lord addressed them in words like these: \"Go into the city, and say unto him [or \"it \"],[fn-22-P2223_937955:562-nf] The Master saith, My time is at hand, I will keep the passover at thy house,\" it might have been supposed that the terms were intended to be directed to the city itself. For this reason, therefore, Matthew has inserted the statement, that the Lord bade them go \"to such a man,\" not, however, as a statement made by the Lord, whose instructions he was recording, but simply as one volunteered by himself, with the view of avoiding the necessity of narrating the whole at length, when it seemed to him that this was all that required to be mentioned in order to bring out with sufficient accuracy what was really meant by the person who gave the order. For who can fail to see that no one naturally speaks to others in such an indefinite fashion as this, \"Go ye to such a man\"? If, again, the words had been, \"Go ye to any one whatsoever,\" or \"to any one you please,\"[fn-22-P2224_939021:563-nf] the mode of expression might have been correct enough, but the person to whom the disciples were sent would have been left uncertain: whereas Mark and Luke present him as a certain definitely indicated individual, although they pass over his name in silence. The Lord Himself, we may be sure, knew to what person it was that He despatched them. And in order that those also whom He was thus sending might be able to discover the individual meant, He gave them, before they set out, a particular sign which they were to follow,-namely, the appearance of a man bearing a pitcher or a vessel of water,-and told them, that if they went after him, they would reach the house which He intended. Hence, seeing that it was not competent here to employ the phraseology,\" Go to any one you please,\" which is indeed legitimate enough, so far as the demands of linguistic propriety are concerned, but which an accurate statement of the matter dealt with here renders inadmissible in this passage, with how much less warrant could an expression like this have been used here (by the speaker Himself), \"Go to such a man,\" which the usage of correct language can never admit at all? But it is manifest that the disciples were sent by the Lord, plainly, not to any man they pleased, but to \"such a man,\" that is to say, to a certain definite individual. And that is a thing which the evangelist, speaking in his own person, could quite rightly have related to us, by putting it in this way: \"He sent them to such a man,[fn-22-P2225_940564:564-nf] in order to say to him, I will keep the passover at thy house.\" He might also have expressed it thus: \"He sent them to such a man, saying, Go, say to him, I will keep the passover at thy house.\" And thus it is that, after giving us the words actually spoken by the Lord Himself, namely, \"Go into the city,\" he has introduced this addition of his own, \"to such a man,\" which he does, however, not as if the Lord had thus expressed Himself, but simply with the view of giving us to understand, although the name is left unrecorded, that there was a particular person in the city to whom the Lord's disciples were sent, in order to make ready the passover. Thus, too, after the two [or three] words brought in that manner as an explanation of his own, he takes up again the order of the words as they were uttered by the Lord Himself, namely, \"And say unto him, The Master saith.\" And if you ask now \"to whom\" they were to say this, the correct reply is given [at once] in these terms, To that particular man to whom the evangelist has given us to understand that the Lord sent them, when, speaking in His own person, he introduced the clause, \"to such a man.\" The clause thus inserted may indeed contain a rather unusual mode of expression, but still it is a perfectly legitimate phraseology when it is thus understood. Or it may be, that in the Hebrew language, in which Matthew is reported to have written, there is some peculiar usage which might make it entirely accordant with the laws of correct expression, even were the whole taken to have been spoken by the Lord Himself. Whether that is the case, those who understand that tongue may decide. Even in the Latin language itself, indeed, this kind of expression might also be used, in terms like these: \"Go into the city to such a man as may be indicated by a person who shall meet you carrying a pitcher of water.\" If the instructions were conveyed in such words as these, they could be acted upon without any ambiguity. Or again, if the terms were anything like these, \"Go into the city to such a man, who resides in this or the other place, in such and such a house,\" then the note thus given of the place and the designation of the house would make it quite possible to understand the commission delivered, and to execute it. But when these instructions, and all others of a similar order, are left entirely untold, the person who in such circumstances uses this kind of address, \"Go to such a man, and say unto him,\" cannot possibly be listened to intelligently for this obvious reason, that when he employs the terms, \"to such a man,\" he intends a certain particular individual to be understood by them, and yet offers us no hint by which he may be identified. But if we are to suppose that the clause referred to is one introduced as an explanation by the evangelist himself, [we may find that] the requirements of brevity will render the expression somewhat obscure, without, however, making it incorrect. Moreover, as to the fact, that where Mark speaks of a pitcher[fn-22-P2226_943615:565-nf] of water, Luke mentions a vessel,[fn-22-P2227_943673:566-nf] the simple explanation is, that the one has used a word indicative of the kind of vessel, and the other a term indicative of its capacity, while both evangelists have nevertheless preserved the real meaning actually intended.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":14,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":82,"source_paragraph":"323","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"157.

And surely there is nothing incredible in supposing that Peter was moved to such an act of presumption on several occasions, separated from each other by certain intervals of time, as he was actually instigated to deny Him repeatedly. Neither should it seem unreasonable to fancy that the Lord gave him a reply in similar terms at three successive periods, especially when [we see that] in immediate connection with each other, and without the interposition of anything else either in fact or word, Christ addressed the question to him three several times whether he loved Him, and that, when Peter returned the same answer thrice over, He also gave him thrice over the self-same charge to feed His sheep.[fn-22-P2267_957238:19-nf] That it is the more reasonable thing to suppose that Peter displayed his presumption on three different occasions, and that thrice over he received from the Lord a warning with respect to his triple denial, is further proved, as we may see, by the very terms employed by the evangelists, which record sayings uttered by the Lord in diverse form and of diverse import. Let us here call attention again to that passage which I introduced a little ago from the Gospel of John. There we certainly find that He had expressed Himself in this way \"Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you. A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another. Simon Peter saith unto Him, Lord, whither goest Thou?\"[fn-22-P2268_958198:20-nf] Now, surely it is evident here that what moved Peter to utter this question, \"Lord, whither goest Thou?\" was the words which the Lord Himself had spoken. For he had heard Him say, \"Whither I go, ye cannot come.\" Then Jesus made this reply to the said Peter: \"Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now, but thou shall follow me afterwards.\" Thereupon Peter expressed himself thus: \"Lord, why cannot I follow Thee now? I will lay down my life for Thy sake.\"[fn-22-P2269_958678:21-nf] And to this presumptuous declaration the Lord responded by predicting his denial. Luke, again, first mentions how the Lord said, \"Simon, behold Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not; and, when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren:\" next he proceeds immediately to tell us how Peter replied to this effect: \"Lord, I am ready to go with Thee, both unto prison and to death;\" and then he continues thus: \"And He said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.\"[fn-22-P2270_959309:22-nf] Now, who can fail to perceive that this is an occasion by itself, and that the incident in connection with which Peter was incited to make the presumptuous declaration already referred to is an entirely different one? But, once more, Matthew presents us with the following passage: \"And when they had sung an hymn,\" he says, \"they went out into the Mount of Olives. Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.\"[fn-22-P2271_959941:23-nf] The same passage is given in precisely the same form by Mark.[fn-22-P2272_960027:24-nf] What similarity is there, however, in these words, or in the ideas expressed by them, either to the terms in which John represents Peter to have made his presumptuous declaration, or to those in which Luke exhibits him as uttering such an asseveration? And so we find that in Matthew's narrative the connection proceeds immediately thus: \"Peter answered and said unto Him, Though all men shall be offended because of Thee, yet will I never be offended. Jesus saith unto him, Verily, I say unto thee, that this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. Peter saith unto him, Though I should die with Thee, yet will I not deny Thee. Likewise also said all His disciples.\"[fn-22-P2273_960734:25-nf] ","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":14,"verse":32,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"43","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"10. Matthew then proceeds with his narrative in the same connection as follows: \"Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane.\"[fn-22-P2294_974789:38-nf] This is mentioned also by Mark.[fn-22-P2295_974845:39-nf] Luke, too, refers to it, although he does not notice the piece of ground by name. For he says: \"And He came out, and went, as was His wont, to the Mount of Olives; and His disciples also followed Him. And when He was at the place, He said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.\"[fn-22-P2296_975158:40-nf] That is the place which the other two have instanced under the name of Gethsemane. There, we understand, was the garden which John brings into notice when he gives the following narration: \"When Jesus had spoken these words, He went forth with His disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which He entered, and His disciples.\"[fn-22-P2297_975529:41-nf] Then taking Matthew's record, we get this statement next in order: \"He said unto His disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.[fn-22-P2298_975686:42-nf] And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. Then saith He unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me. And He went a little farther, and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt. And He cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What! could ye not watch with me one hour? Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me except I drink it, Thy will be done. And He came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy. And He left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. Then cometh He to His disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that shall betray me.\"[fn-22-P2299_977077:43-nf] ","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":14,"verse":43,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"49","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"15.

They answered Him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am He. And Judas also, which betrayed Him, stood with them.

And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Master; and kissed Him.\"[fn-23-P2313_986864:50-nf] First of all, however, as we gather from Luke's statement, He said to the traitor, \"Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?\"[fn-23-P2314_987040:51-nf] Next, as we learn from Matthew, He spoke thus: \"Friend, wherefore art thou come?\" Thereafter He added certain words which are found in John's narrative, which runs in the following strain: \"Whom seek ye? They answered Him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am He. And Judas also, which betrayed Him, stood with them. As soon then as He had said unto them, I am He, they went backward, and fell to the ground. Then asked He them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus answered, I have told you that I am He: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way; that the saying might be fulfilled which He spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none.\"[fn-23-P2315_987746:52-nf] ","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":14,"verse":52,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"52","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"18.

But it was not when he was outside at the gate that he denied the Lord the second time. That took place after he had come back to the fire-place. There was no need, however, to mention the precise time at which he did thus return. Consequently Mark goes on with his narrative of the incident in these terms: \"And he went out into the porch, and the cock crew. And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them. And he denied it again.\"[fn-23-P2354_1002030:81-nf] This is not the same maid, however, as the former one, but another, as Matthew tells us. Nay, we gather further that on the occasion of the second denial he was addressed by two parties, namely, by the maid who is mentioned by Matthew and Mark, and also by another person who is noticed by Luke. For Luke's account runs in this style: \"And Peter followed afar off. And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were sat down together, Peter sat down among them. But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him. And he denied Him, saying, Woman, I know Him not. And after a little while, another saw him, and said, \"Thou art also of them.\"[fn-23-P2355_1002781:82-nf] Now the clause, \"And after a little while,\" which Luke introduces, covers the period during which [we may suppose that] Peter went out and the first cock crew. By this time, however, he had come in again; and thus we can understand the consistency of John's narrative, which informs us that he denied the Lord the second time as he stood by the fire. For in his version of Peter's first denial, John not only says nothing about the first crowing of the cock (which holds good of the other evangelists, too, with the exception of Mark), but also leaves unnoticed the fact that it was as he sat by the fire that the maid recognised him. For all that John says there is this, \"Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.\"[fn-23-P2356_1003599:83-nf] Then he brings in the statement which he deemed it right to make on the subject of what took place with Jesus in that same house. His record of this is to the following effect: \"And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals, for it was cold. And they warmed themselves; and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.\"[fn-23-P2357_1003964:84-nf] Here, therefore, we may suppose Peter to have gone out, and by this time to have come in again. For at first he was sitting by the fire; and after a space, as we gather, he had returned, and commenced to stand [by the hearth].","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":14,"verse":69,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"59","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"24. It may be, however, that some one will say to us: Peter had not actually gone out as yet, but had only risen with the purpose of going out. This may be the allegation of one who is of opinion that the second interrogation and denial took place when Peter was outside at the door. Let us therefore look at what follows in John's narrative. It is to this effect: \"The high priest then asked Jesus of His disciples, and of His doctrine. Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in thesynagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing. Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said. And when He had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so? Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why smitest thou me? And Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.\"[fn-23-P2359_1005224:85-nf] This certainly shows us that Annas was high priest. For Jesus had not been sent to Caiaphas as yet, when the question was thus put to Him, \"Answerest thou the high priest so?\" Mention is also made of Annas and Caiaphas as high priests by Luke at the beginning of his Gospel.[fn-23-P2360_1005523:86-nf] After these statements, John reverts to the account which he had previously begun of Peter's denial. Thus he brings us back to the house in which the incidents took place which he has recorded, and from which Jesus was sent away to Caiaphas, to whom He was being conducted at the commencement of this scene, as Matthew has informed us.[fn-23-P2361_1005877:87-nf] Moreover, it is in the way of a recapitulation that John records the matters regarding Peter which he has introduced at this point. Falling back upon his narration of that incident with the view of making up a complete account of the threefold denial, he proceeds thus: \"And Simon stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.\"[fn-23-P2362_1006724:88-nf] Here, therefore, we find that Peter's second denial occurred, not when he was at the door,but as he was standing by the fire. This, however, could not have been the case, had he notreturned by this time after having gone outside.For it is not that by this second occasion he had actually gone out, and that the other maid who is referred to saw him there outside; but the matter is put as if it was on his going out that she saw him; or, in other words, it was when he rose to go out that she observed him, and said to those who were there,-that is, to those who were gathered by the fire inside, within the court,-\"This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.\" Then we are to suppose that the man who had thus gone outside, on hearing thisassertion, came in again, and swore to those whowere now inimically disposed, \"I do not know the man.\"[fn-23-P2363_1007588:89-nf] In like manner, Mark also says of this same maid, that \"she began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.\"[fn-23-P2364_1007729:90-nf] For this damsel was speaking not to Peter, but to those who had remained there when he went out. At the same time, she spoke in such a manner that he heard her words; whereupon he came back and stood again by the fire, and met their words with a negative. Then we have the statement made by John in these terms: \"They said, Art not thou also one of his disciples?\" We understand this question to have been addressed to him on his return as he stood there; and we also recognise the harmony in which this stands with the position that on this occasion Peter had to do not only with that other maid who is mentioned by Matthew and Mark in connection with this second denial, but also with that other person who is introduced by Luke. This is the reason why John uses the plural, \"They said.\" The explanation then may be, that when the maid said to those who were with her in the court as he went out, \"This is one of them,\" he heard her words and returned with the purpose of clearing himself, as it were, by a denial. Or, in accordance with the more probable theory, we may suppose that he did not catch what was said about him as he went out, and that on his return the maid and the other person who is introduced by Luke addressed him thus, \"Art not thou also one of his disciples?\" that he met them with a denial, \"and said, I am not;\" and further, that when this other person of whom Luke speaks insisted more pertinaciously, and said, \"Surely thou art one of them,\" Peter answered thus, \"Man, I am not.\" Still, when we compare together all the statements made by the several evangelists on this subject, we come clearly to the conclusion, that Peter's second denial took place, not when he was at the door, but when he was within, by the fire in the court. It becomes evident, therefore, that Matthew and Mark, who have told us how he went without, have left the fact of his return unnoticed simply with a view to brevity.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":14,"verse":70,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"60","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"25. Accordingly, let us next examine into the consistency of the evangelists so far as the third denial is concerned, which we have previously instanced in the statement given by Matthew only. Mark then goes on with his version in these terms: \"And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them; for thou art a Galilaean. But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak. And immediately the second time the cock crew.\"[fn-23-P2366_1010164:91-nf] Luke, again, continues his narrative, relating the same incident in this fashion: \"And about the space of one hour after, another confidently affirmed, Of a truth this fellow also was with him; for he is a Galilaean. And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately while he yet spake the cock crew.\"[fn-23-P2367_1010504:92-nf] John follows with his account of Peter's third denial, which is thus given: \"One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him? Peter then denied again; and immediately the cock crew.\"[fn-23-P2368_1010796:93-nf] Now what precise period of time is meant under the phrase, \"a little after,\" which is employed by Matthew and Mark, is made clear by Luke, when he says, \"And about the space of one hour after.\" John, however, conveys no intimation of this space of time. Again, with respect to the circumstance that Matthew and Mark use the plural number instead of the singular, and speak of the persons who were engaged with Peter, while Luke mentions only a single individual, and John, too, specifies but one, particularizing him further as kinsman to him whose ear Peter cut off; we may easily explain it either by understanding Matthew and Mark to have adopted a familiar method of speech here in employing the plural number simply instead of the singular, or by supposing that one of the persons present-one who knew Peter and had seen him-took the lead in making the declaration, and that the rest, imitating his confidence, joined him in pressing the assertion upon Peter. If this is the case, then two of the evangelists have given the general statement, using simply the plural number; while the other two have preferred to particularize only the one special individual who played the chief part in the transaction. But, once more, Matthew affirms that the words, \"Surely thou also art one of them, for thy speech bewrayeth thee,\" were spoken to Peter himself. In like manner, John tells us that the question, \"Did not I see thee in the garden with him?\" was addressed directly to Peter. But Mark, on the other hand, gives us to understand that the sentence, \"Surely he is one of them, for he is also a Galilaean,\" was what those who stood by said to each other about Peter. And, in the same way, Luke indicates that the declaration uttered by the other person, who said, \"Of a truth, this fellow also was with him, for he is a Galilaean,\" was not addressed to Peter, but was made regarding Peter. These variations, however, may be explained either by understanding the evangelists, who speak of Peter as the person directly addressed, to have fairly reproduced the general sense, inasmuch as what was spoken about the man in his own presence was much the same as if it had been spoken immediately to him; or by supposing that both these methods of address were actually practised, and that the one has been noticed by the former evangelists, and the other by the latter. Moreover, we take the second cockcrowing to have occurred after the third denial, as Mark has expressly informed us.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":14,"verse":66,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"61","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"26. Matthew then proceeds with his narrative in these terms: \"And Peter remembered the word of Jesus which He had said unto him, Before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out and wept bitterly.\"[fn-23-P2370_1013516:94-nf] Mark, again, gives it thus: \"And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus had said unto him, Before the cock crow twice thou shall deny me thrice. And he began to weep.\"[fn-23-P2371_1013707:95-nf] Luke's version is as follows: \"And the Lord turned and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said unto him, Before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice. And Peter went out and wept bitterly.\"[fn-23-P2372_1014223:96-nf] John says nothing about Peter's recollection and weeping. Now, the statement made here by Luke, to the effect that \"the Lord turned and looked upon Peter,\" is one which requires more careful consideration, with a view to its correct acceptance. For although there are also inner halls (or courts), so named, it was in the outer court (or hall) that Peter appeared on this occasion among the servants, who were warming themselves along with him at the fire. And it is not a credible supposition that Jesus was heard by the Jews in this place, so that we might also understand the look referred to have been a look with the bodily eye. For Matthew presents us first with this narrative: \"Then did they spit in His face and buffeted Him; and others smote Him with the palms of their hands, saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, who is he that smote thee?\"[fn-23-P2373_1015101:97-nf] And then he follows this up immediately with the paragraph about Peter: \"Now Peter sat without in the palace.\"[fn-23-P2374_1015237:98-nf] He would not, however, have used this latter expression, had it not been the case that the things previously alluded to were done to the Lord inside the house. And, indeed, as we gather from Mark's version, these things took place not simply in the interior, but also in the upper parts of the house. For, after recording the said circumstances, Mark goes on thus: \"And as Peter was beneath in the palace.\"[fn-23-P2375_1015790:99-nf] Thus, as Matthew's words, \"Now Peter sat without in the palace,\" show us that the things previously mentioned took place inside the house, so Mark's words, \"And as Peter was beneath in the palace,\" indicate that they were done not only in the interior, but in the upper parts of the house. But if this is the case, how could the Lord have looked on Peter with the actual glance of the bodily eye? These considerations bring me to the conclusion, that the look in question was one cast upon Peter from Heaven, the effect of which was to bring up before his mind the number of times he had now denied [his Master], and the declaration which the Lord had made to him prophetically, and in this way (the Lord thus looking mercifully upon him[fn-23-P2376_1016549:100-nf] ), to lead him to repent, and to weep salutary tears. The expression, therefore, will be a parallel to other modes of speech which we employ daily, as when we thus pray, \"Lord, look upon me;\" or as when, in reference to one who has been delivered by the divine mercy from some danger or trouble, we say that the \"Lord looked upon him.\" In the Scriptures, also, we find such words as these: \"Look upon me and hear me;[fn-23-P2377_1017005:101-nf] and \"Return,[fn-23-P2378_1017038:102-nf] O Lord, and deliver my soul.\"[fn-23-P2379_1017085:103-nf] And, according to my judgment, a similar view is to be taken of the expression adopted here, when it is said that \"the Lord turned and looked upon Peter; and Peter remembered the word of the Lord.\" Finally, we have to notice how, while it is the more usual practice with the evangelists to employ the name \"Jesus\" in preference to the word \"Lord\" in their narratives, Luke has used the latter term exclusively in the said sentence, saying expressly, \"The `Lord' turned and looked upon Peter; and Peter remembered the word of the `Lord:'\" whereas Matthew and Mark have passed over this \"look\" in silence, and consequently have said that Peter remembered not the word of the \"Lord,\" but the word of \"Jesus.\" From this, therefore, we may gather that the \"look\" thus proceeding from Jesus was not one with the eyes of the human body, but a look cast from Heaven.[fn-23-P2380_1017962:104-nf] ","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":14,"verse":55,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"63","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"27.

At the same time, however, there are not wanting persons who would have the time of the preparation-which is referred to by John, when he says, \"And it was the preparation of the passover, about the sixth hour\"-understood under this third hour of the day, which was also the period at which Pilate sat down upon the judgment-seat. In this way the completion of the said third hour would appear to be the time when He was crucified, and when He was now hanging on the tree. Other three hours must then be supposed to have passed, at the end of which He gave up the ghost. According to this idea, too, the darkness would have commenced with the hour at which He died-that is to say, the sixth hour of the day-and have lasted until the ninth. For these persons affirm that the preparation of the passover of the Jews was indeed on the day which was followed by the day of the Sabbath, because the days of unleavened bread began with the said Sabbath; but that, nevertheless, the true passover, which was being realized in the Lord's passion, the passover not of the Jews, but of the Christians, began to be prepared-that is, to have its parasceue-from the ninth hour of the night onwards, inasmuch as the Lord was then being prepared for being put to death by the Jews.

Again, if we suppose it was at the time when He was delivered up to Pilate, we have in the plainest terms the statement of Scripture, to the effect that by this time it was morning. Consequently, it only remains for us to understand that this parasceue of the passover-that is to say, the preparation for the death of the Lord-commenced at the period when all the chief priests, in whose presence He was first heard, answered and said, \"He is guilty of death,\" an utterance which we find reported both by Matthew and by Mark;[fn-25-P2505_1090958:191-nf] so that they are taken to have introduced, in the form of a recapitulation, at a later stage, facts relating to the denial of Peter, which in point of historical order had taken place at an earlier point. And it is nothing unreasonable to conjecture, that the time at which, as I have said, they pronounced Him guilty of death, may very well have been the ninth hour of the night, between which time and the hour at which Pilate sat down on the judgment-seat there came in this sixth hour, as it is called-not, however, the sixth hour of the day, but that of the parasceue-that is to say, the preparation for the sacrifice of the Lord, which is the true passover. And, on this theory, the Lord was suspended on the tree when the sixth hour of the same parasceue was completed, which occurred at the completion of the third hour of the day.[fn-25-P2506_1091835:192-nf] We may make our choice, therefore, between this view and the other, which supposes Mark to have introduced the third hour by way of reminiscence, and to have had it especially in view, in mentioning the hour there, to suggest the fact of the condemnation brought upon the Jews in the matter of the Lord's crucifixion, in so far as they are understood to have been in a position to raise the clamour for His crucifixion to such an effect that we may hold them to have been the persons who actually crucified Him, rather than the men by whose hands He was suspended on the tree; just as the centurion, already referred to, approached the Lord in a more genuine sense than could be said of those friends whom He sent [on the matter-of-fact mission].[fn-25-P2507_1092762:193-nf] But whichever of these two views we adopt, unquestionably a solution is found for this problem on the subject of the hour of the Lord's passion, which is most remarkably apt at once to excite the impudence of the contentious and I to agitate the inexperience of the weak.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":14,"verse":64,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"92","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"50.

And, on this theory, the Lord was suspended on the tree when the sixth hour of the same parasceue was completed, which occurred at the completion of the third hour of the day.[fn-25-P2506_1091835:192-nf] We may make our choice, therefore, between this view and the other, which supposes Mark to have introduced the third hour by way of reminiscence, and to have had it especially in view, in mentioning the hour there, to suggest the fact of the condemnation brought upon the Jews in the matter of the Lord's crucifixion, in so far as they are understood to have been in a position to raise the clamour for His crucifixion to such an effect that we may hold them to have been the persons who actually crucified Him, rather than the men by whose hands He was suspended on the tree; just as the centurion, already referred to, approached the Lord in a more genuine sense than could be said of those friends whom He sent [on the matter-of-fact mission].[fn-25-P2507_1092762:193-nf] But whichever of these two views we adopt, unquestionably a solution is found for this problem on the subject of the hour of the Lord's passion, which is most remarkably apt at once to excite the impudence of the contentious and I to agitate the inexperience of the weak.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":14,"verse":35,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_24_book_ii_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"72","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"42.

For who resists God that He may not dowhat He wills? But, since we are hindered by the devil from obeying God with our thought and deed in all things, we pray and ask that God's will may be done in us. And that it may be done in us, we have need of God's will, that is, of His help and protection; since no one is strong in his own strength, but he is safe by the indulgence and mercy of God.\"[fn-57-P5721_2247615:80-nf] In another place also: \"Moreover, we ask that the will of God may be done both in heaven and in earth, each of which things pertains to the fulfilment of our safety and salvation. For since we possess the body from the earth, and the spirit from heaven, we are ourselves earth and heaven; and in both, that is, both in body and in spirit, we pray that God's will be done. For between the flesh and the spirit there is a struggle, and there is a daily strife as they disagree one with the other; so that we cannot do the very things that we would, in that the spirit seeks heavenly and divine things, while the flesh lusts after earthly and temporal things. And, therefore, we ask that, by the help and assistance of God, agreement may be made between these two natures; so that while the will of God is done both in the spirit and in the flesh, the soul which is newborn by Him may be preserved. And this the Apostle Paul openly and manifestly declares by his words. `The flesh,' says he, `lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other, so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.'\"[fn-57-P5722_2248825:81-nf] And a little after he says: \"And it may be thus understood, most beloved brethren, that since the Lord commands and teaches us even to love our enemies, and to pray even for those who persecute us, we should ask even for those who are still earth, and have not yet begun to be heavenly, that even in respect of these God's will may be done, which Christ accomplished in preserving and renewing humanity.\"[fn-57-P5723_2249319:82-nf] And again, in another place he says: \"But we ask that this bread should be given to us daily, that we who are in Christ, and daily receive the Eucharist for the food of salvation, may not, by the interposition of some more heinous sin,-by being prevented, as those abstaining and not communicating, from partaking of the heavenly bread,-be separated from Christ's body.\"[fn-57-P5724_2249730:83-nf] And a little afterwards, in the same treatise he says: \"But when we ask that we may not come into temptation, we are reminded of our infirmity and weakness, while we so ask as that no one should insolently vaunt himself; that none should proudly and arrogantly assume anything to himself; that none should take to himself the glory either of confession or of suffering as his own, when the Lord Himself teaching humility said, `Watch and pray, that ye come not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak;'[fn-57-P5725_2250295:84-nf] so that while a humble and submissive confession comes first, and all is attributed to God, whatever is sought for suppliantly, with fear and honour of God, may be granted by His own loving-kindness.\"[fn-57-P5726_2250534:85-nf] Moreover, in his treatise addressed to Quirinus, in respect to which work Pelagius wishes himself to appear as his imitator, he says in the Third Book \"that we must boast in nothing, since nothing is our own.\"[fn-57-P5727_2250823:86-nf] And subjoining the divine testimonies to this proposition, he added among others that apostolic word with which especially the mouths of such as these must be closed: \"For what hast thou, which thou hast not received? But if thou hast received it, why boastest thou as if thou hadst not received it?\" Also in the epistle concerning Patience he says: \"For we have this virtue in common with God.

These Holy ones have drawn to themselves one of like conversation; those athletes a fellow athlete; those crowned ones another crowned like them; the pure in heart one chaste in soul: those ministers of the Word another herald of that Word. Most blessed, indeed, is our Father for this his joining the Apostolic band and his departure to Christ. Most pitiable we! for the unseasonableness of our orphaned condition does not permit us to congratulate ourselves on our Father's happy lot. For him, indeed, better it was by his departure hence to be with Christ, but it was a grievous thing for us to be severed from his fatherly guidance. Behold, it is a time of need for counsel; and our counsellor is silent. War, the war of heresy, encompasses us, and our Leader is no more. The general body of the Church labours under disease, and we find not the physician. See in what a strait we are. Oh! that it were possible I could nerve my weakness, and rising to the full proportions of our loss, burst out with a voice of lamentation adequate to the greatness of the distress, as these excellent preachers of yours have done, who have bewailed with loud voice the misfortune that has befallen them in this loss of their father. But what can I do? How can I force my tongue to the service of the theme, thus heavily weighted, and shackled, as it were, by this calamity? How shall I open my mouth thus subdued to speechlessness? How shall I give free utterance to a voice now habitually sinking to the pathetic tone of lamentations? How can I lift up the eyes of my soul, veiled as I am with this darkness of misfortune? Who will pierce for me this deep dark cloud of grief, and light up again, as out of a clear sky, the bright ray of peace? From what quarter will that ray shine forth, now that our star has set? Oh! evil moonless night that gives no hope of any star! With what an opposite meaning, as compared with those of late, are our words uttered in this place now! Then we rejoiced with the song of marriage, now we give way to piteous lamentation for the sorrow that has befallen us! Then we chanted an epithalamium, but now a funeral dirge! You remember the day when we entertained you at the feast of that spiritual marriage, and brought home the virgin bride to the house of her noble bridegroom; when to the best of our ability we proffered the wedding gifts of our praises, both giving and receiving joy in turn[fn-40-P4093_2715617:1-nf] . But now our delight has been changed to lamentation, and our festal garb become sackcloth. It were better, maybe, to suppress our woe, and to hide our grief in silent seclusion, so as not to disturb the children of the bride-chamber, divested as we are of the bright marriage garment, and clothed instead with the black robe of the preacher. For since that noble bridegroom has been taken from us, sorrow has all at once clothed us in the garb of black; nor is it possible for us to indulge in the usual cheerfulness of our conversation, since Envy[fn-40-P4094_2716349:2-nf] has stripped us of our proper and be- coming dress. Rich in blessings we came to you; now we leave you bare and poor. The lamp we held right above our head, shining with the rich fulness of light, we now carry away quenched, its bright flame all dissolved into smoke and dust. We held our great treasure in an earthen vessel. Vanished is the treasure, and the earthen vessel, emptied of its wealth, is restored to them who gave it[fn-40-P4095_2717437:3-nf] . What shall we say who have consigned it? What answer will they make by whom it is demanded back? Oh! miserable shipwreck! How, even with the harbour around us, have we gone to pieces with our hopes! How has the vessel, fraught with a thousand bales of goods, sunk with all its cargo, and left us destitute who were once so rich! Where is that bright sail which was ever filled by the Holy Ghost? Where is that safe helm of our souls which steered us while we sailed unhurt over the swelling waves of heresy? Where that immovable anchor of intelligence which held us in absolute security and repose after our toils? Where that excellent pilot[fn-40-P4096_2718198:4-nf] who steered our bark to its heavenly goal? Is, then, what has happened of small moment, and is my passionate grief unreasoning? Is it not rather that I reach not the full extent of our loss, though I exceed in the loudness of my expression of grief? Lend me, oh lend me, my brethren, the tear of sympathy. When you were glad we shared your gladness. Repay us, therefore, this sad recompense. \"Rejoice with them that do rejoice[fn-40-P4097_2718667:5-nf] .\" This we have done. It is for you to return it by \"weeping with them that weep.\" It happened once that a strange people bewailed the loss of the patriarch Jacob, and made the misfortune of another people their own, when his united family transported their father out of Egypt, and lamented in another land the loss that had befallen them. They all prolonged their mourning over him for thirty days and as many nights[fn-40-P4098_2719103:6-nf] . Ye, therefore, that are brethren, and of the same kindred, do as they who were of another kindred did. On that occasion the tear of strangers was shed in common with that of countrymen; be it shed in common now, for common is the grief. Behold these your patriarchs. All these are children of our Jacob. All these are children of the free-woman[fn-40-P4099_2719705:7-nf] . No one is base born, no one supposititious. Nor indeed would it have become that Saint to introduce into the nobility of the family of Faith a bond-woman's kindred. Therefore is he our father because he was the father of our father[fn-41-P4100_2719955:8-nf] . Ye have just heard what and how great things an Ephraim and a Manasses[fn-41-P4101_2720110:9-nf] related of their father, and how the wonders of the story surpassed description. Give me also leave to speak on them. For this beatification of him from henceforth incurs no risk. Neither fear I Envy; for what worse evil can it do me? Know, then, what the man was; one of the nobility of the East, blameless, just, genuine, devout, innocent of any evil deed. Indeed the great Job will not be jealous if he who imitated him be decked with the like testimonials of praise. But Envy, that has an eye for all things fair, cast a bitter glance upon our blessedness; and one who stalks up and down the world also stalked in our midst, and broadly stamped the foot-mark of affliction on our happy state. It is not herds of oxen or sheep[fn-41-P4102_2721016:10-nf] that he has maltreated, unless in a mystical sense one transfers the idea of a flock to the Church. It is not in these that we have received injury from Envy; it is not in asses or camels that he has wrought us loss, neither has he excruciated our bodily feelings by a wound in the flesh; no, but he has robbed us of our very head. And with that head have gone away from us the precious organs of our senses. That eye which beheld the things of heaven is no longer ours, nor that ear which listened to the Divine voice, nor that tongue with its pure devotion to truth[fn-41-P4103_2721612:11-nf] . Where is that sweet serenity of his eyes? Where that bright smile upon his lips? Where that courteous right hand with fingers outstretched to accompany the benediction of the mouth. I feel an impulse, as if I were on the stage, to shout aloud for our calamity. Oh! Church, I pity you. To you, the city of Antioch, I address my words. I pity you for this sudden reversal. How has your beauty been despoiled! How have you been robbed of your ornaments! How suddenly has the flower faded! \"Verily the grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth away[fn-41-P4104_2722200:12-nf] .\" What evil eye, what witchery of drunken malice has intruded on that distant Church? What is there to compensate her loss? The fountain has failed. The stream has dried up. Again has water been turned into blood[fn-41-P4105_2722444:13-nf] . Oh! the sad tidings which tell the Church of her calamity! Who shall say to the children that they have no more a father? Who shall tell the Bride she is a widow? Alas for their woes! What did they send out? What do they receive back? They sent forth an ark, they receive back a coffin. The ark, my brethren, was that man of God; an ark containing in itself the Divine and mystic things. There was the golden vessel full of Divine manna, that celestial food[fn-41-P4106_2722925:14-nf] . In it were the Tables of the Covenant written on the tablets of the heart, not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God[fn-41-P4107_2723201:15-nf] . For on that pure heart no gloomy or inky thought was imprinted. In it, too, were the pillars, the steps, the chapters, the lamps, the mercy-seat, the baths, the veils of the entrances. In it was the rod of the priesthood, which budded in the hands of our Saint; and whatever else we have heard the Ark contained[fn-41-P4108_2723547:16-nf] was all held in the soul of that man. But in their stead what is there now? Let description cease. Cloths of pure white linen scarves of silk, abundance of perfumes and spices; the loving munificence of a modest and beautiful lady[fn-41-P4109_2724035:17-nf] . For it must be told, so as to be for a memorial of her[fn-41-P4110_2724143:18-nf] , what she did for that Priest when, without stint, she poured the alabaster box of ointment on his head. But the treasure preserved within, what is it? Bones, now dead, and which even before dissolution had rehearsed their dying, the sad memorials of our affliction. Oh! what a cry like that of old will be heard in Rama, Rachel weeping[fn-41-P4111_2724521:19-nf] , not for her children but for a husband, and admitting not of consolation. Let alone, ye that would console; let alone; force not on us your consolation[fn-41-P4112_2724695:20-nf] . Let the widow indulge the deepness of her grief. Let her feel the loss that has been inflicted on her. Yet she is not without previous practice in separation. In those contests in which our athlete was engaged she had before been trained to bear to be left. Certainly you must remember how a previous sermon to ours related to you the contests of the man; how throughout, even in the very number of his contests, he had maintained the glory of the Holy Trinity, which he ever glorified; for there were three trying attacks that he had to repel. You have heard the whole series of his labours, what he was in the first, what in the middle, and what in the last. I deem it superfluous to repeat what has been so well described. Yet it may not be out of place to add just so much as this. When that Church, so sound in the faith, at the first beheld the man, she saw features truly formed[fn-41-P4113_2725801:21-nf] after the image of God, she saw love welling forth, she saw grace poured around his lips, a consummate perfection of humility beyond which it is impossible to conceive any thing further, a gentleness like that of David, the understanding of Solomon, a goodness like that of Moses, a strictness as of Samuel, a chastity as of Joseph, the skill of a Daniel, a zeal for the faith such as was in the great Elijah, a purity of body like that of the lofty-minded John[fn-41-P4114_2726354:22-nf] , an unsurpassable love as of Paul. She saw the concurrence of so many excellences in one soul, and, thrilled with a blessed affection, she loved him, her own bridegroom, with a pure and virtuous passion. But ere she could accomplish her desire, ere she could satisfy her longing, while still in the fervour of her passion, she was left desolate, when those trying times called the athlete to his contests. While, then, he was engaged in these toilsome struggles for religion, she remained chaste and kept the marriage vow. A long time intervened, during which one, with adulterous intent[fn-41-P4115_2727242:23-nf] , made an attempt upon the immaculate bridal-chamber. But the Bride remained undefiled; and again there was a return, and again an exile. And thus it happened thrice, until the Lord dispelled the gloom of that heresy, and sending forth a ray of peace gave us the hope of some respite from these lengthened troubles[fn-41-P4116_2727652:24-nf] . But when at length they had seen each other, when there was a renewal of those chaste joys and spiritual desires, when the flame of love had again been lit, all at once his last departure breaks off the enjoyment. He came to adorn you as his bride, he failed not in the eagerness of his zeal, he placed on this fair union the chaplets of blessing, in imitation of his Master. As did the Lord at Cana of Galilee[fn-41-P4117_2728473:25-nf] , so here did this imitator of Christ. The Jewish waterpots, which were filled with the water of heresy, he filled with genuine wine, changing its nature by the power of his faith. How often did he set before you a chalice, but not of wine, when with that sweet voice he poured out in rich abundance the wine of Grace, and presented to you the full and varied feast of reason! He went first with the blessing of his words, and then his illustrious disciples were employed in distributing his teaching to the multitude.","title":"Funeral Oration on Meletius","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":14,"verse":31,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_51_on_prayer_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"ANF-03","text":"For the completeness of so brief a prayer He added-in order that we should supplicate not touching the remitting merely, but touching the entire averting, of acts of guilt\" Lead us not into temptation: \"that is, suffer us not to be led into it, by him (of course) who tempts; but far be the thought that the Lord should seem to tempt,[fn-118-P11842_3317931:57-nf] as if He either were ignorant of the faith of any, or else were eager to overthrow it.

But if they say that Judas in perishing was the image of her Enthymesis, neither in this way will the image bear any analogy to that truth which [by hypothesis] corresponds to it. For the Enthymesis having been separated from the Aeon, and itself afterwards receiving a shape from Christ,[fn-69-P6990_1795939:119-nf] then being made a partaker of intelligence by the Saviour, and having formed all things which are outside of the Pleroma, after the image of those which are within the Pleroma, is said at last to have been received by them into the Pleroma, and, according to [the principle of] conjunction, to have been united to that Saviour who was formed out of all. But Judas having been once for all cast away, never returns into the number of the disciples; otherwise a different person would not have been chosen to fill his place.

And this also,-looking at it from the opposite side of this discussion,-those disciples of our Lord themselves attained, upon whom, being previously baptized, the Holy Spirit at length came down on the day of Pentecost, descending from heaven indeed by the will of God, not of His own accord, but effused for this very office, and moreover upon each one of them. Although these were already righteous, and, as we have said, had been baptized by the Lord's baptism even as the apostles themselves, who nevertheless are found on the night on which He was apprehended to have all deserted Him. And even Peter himself, who boasted that he would persevere in his faith, and most obstinately resisted the prediction of the Lord Himself, yet at last denied Him, that by this means it might be shown to us, that whatever sins they bad contracted in the meantime and in any manner, these same sins, by the faith in them subsequently attested as sincere, were without doubt put away by the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Nor, as I think, was it for any other reason that the apostles had charged those whom they addressed in the Holy Spirit, that they should be baptized in the name of Christ Jesus, except that the power of the name of Jesus invoked upon any man by baptism might afford to him who should be baptized no slight advantage for the attainment of salvation, as Peter relates in the Acts of the Apostles, saying: \"For there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.\"[fn-107-P10741_3391413:15-nf] As also the Apostle Paul unfolds, showing that God hath exalted our Lord Jesus, and \"given Him a name, that it may be above every name, that in the name of Jesus all should bow the knee, of things heavenly and earthly, and under the earth, and every. tongue should confess that Jesus is Lord in the glory of God the Father.\" And he on whom, when he should be baptized, invocation should be made in the name of Jesus, although he might obtain baptism under some error, still would not be hindered from knowing the truth at some time or another, and correcting his error, and coming to the Church and to the bishop, and sincerely confessing our Jesus before men; so that then, when hands were laid upon him by the bishop, he might also receive the Holy Spirit, and he would not lose that former invocation of the name of Jesus. Which none of us may disallow, although this invocation, if it be standing bare and by itself, could not suffice for affording salvation, lest on this principle we should believe that even Gentiles and heretics, who abuse the name of Jesus, could attain unto salvation without the true and entire thing. Yet it is extremely useful to believe that this invocation of the name of Jesus, together with the correction of error and the acknowledgment of the belief of the truth, and with the putting away of all stain of past conversation, if rightly performed with the mystery of God among men of this kind, obtains a place which it would not have had, and finally, in the true faith and for the maintenance of the integrity of the sign, is no hindrance, when its supplement which had been wanting is added; and that it is consistent with good reason, with the authority of so many years, and so many churches and apostles and bishops; even as it is the very greatest disadvantage and damage to our most holy mother Church, now for the first time suddenly and without reason to rebel against former decisions after so long a series of so many ages. For not for any other reason Peter-who had already been baptized and had been asked what he thought of the Lord by the Lord Himself, and the truth of the revelation of the Father in heaven being bestowed on him bad confessed that Christ was not only our Lord, but was the Son of the living God-was shown subsequently to have withstood the same Christ when He made announcement of His passion, and therefore was set forth as being called Satan. For no other reason except because it would come to pass that some, although varying in their own judgment, and somewhat halting in faith and doctrine, although they were baptized in the name of Jesus, yet, if they had been able to rescind their error in some interval of time, were not on that account cut off from salvation; but at any time that they had come to the right mind, obtained by repentance a sound hope of salvation, especially when they received the Holy Spirit, to be baptized by Whom is the duty of every man, they would have intended some such thing. Even as we do not apprehend that Peter in the Gospel suffered this alone, but all the disciples, to whom, though already baptized, the Lord afterwards says, that \"all ye shall be offended in me,\"[fn-107-P10742_3394612:16-nf] all of whom, as we observe, having amended their faith, were baptized after the Lord's resurrection with the Holy Spirit. So that not without reason we also in the present day may believe that men, amended from their former error, may be baptized in the Holy Spirit, who, although they were baptized with water in the name of the Lord, might have had a faith somewhat imperfect. Because it is of great importance whether a man is not baptized at all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, or indeed whether in some respect he halts when he is baptized with the baptism of water, which is of less account provided that afterwards a sincere faith in the truth is evident in the baptism of the Spirit, which undoubtedly is of greater account.","title":"A Treatise on Re-Baptism by an Anonymous Writer.","author":"Appendix"},{"chapter":14,"verse":27,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_148_a_treatise_on_re_baptism_by_an_anonymous_writer_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"ANF-05","text":"7.

But to what effect are those words of Christ, who said that He would deny, and not know, those who should say to Him in the day of judgment,\" Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy name, and in Thy name cast out demons, and in Thy name done many wonderful works,\" when He answered them, even with emphasis,[fn-107-P10745_3396305:18-nf] \"I never knew you; depart from me, ye who work iniquity,\"[fn-107-P10746_3396383:19-nf] unless that it should be shown to us, that even by those who work iniquity might these good works also be done, by the superfluous[fn-107-P10747_3396533:20-nf] energy of the name of Christ? Therefore ought this invocation of the name of Jesus to be received as a certain beginning of the mystery of the Lord common to us and to all others, which may afterwards be filled up with the remaining things. Otherwise such an invocation would not avail if it should remain alone, because after the death of a man in this position there cannot be added to him anything at all, nor supplemented, nor can, in anything, avail him in the day of judgment, when they shall begin to be reproached by our Lord with those things which we have above mentioned, none of whom notwithstanding in this present time may by any man be so hardly and cruelly prohibited from aiding themselves in those ways which we have above shown.","title":"A Treatise on Re-Baptism by an Anonymous Writer.","author":"Appendix"},{"chapter":14,"verse":62,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_74_i_from_the_latin_translation_of_cassiodorus_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"37","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Now, in the Gospel according to Mark, the Lord being interrogated by the chief of the priests if He was the Christ, the Son of the blessed God, answering, said, \"I am;[fn-100-P10096_2841191:69-nf] and ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power.[fn-100-P10097_2841391:70-nf] But powers[fn-100-P10098_2841417:71-nf] mean the holy angels.

This word, however, \"Let the cup pass,\" does not mean, Let it not come near me, or approach me.[fn-19-P1981_566212:2-nf] For what can \"pass from Him,\" certainly must first come nigh Him; and what does pass thus from Him, must be by Him. For if it does not reach Him, it cannot pass from Him. For He takes to Himself the person of man, as having been made man. Wherefore also on this occasion He deprecates the doing of the inferior, which is His own, and begs that the superior should be done, which is His Father's, to wit, the divine will; which again, however, in respect of the divinity, is one and the same will in Himself and in the Father. For it was the Father's will that He should pass through every trial (temptation); and the Father Himself in a marvellous manner brought Him on this course, not indeed with the trial itself as His goal, nor in order simply that He might enter into that, but in order that He might prove Himself to be above the trial, and also beyond it.[fn-19-P1982_567147:3-nf] And surely it is the fact, that the Saviour asks neither what is impossible, nor what is impracticable, nor what is contrary to the will of the Father. It is something possible; for I Mark makes mention of His saying, \"Abba, Father, all things are possible unto Thee.\"[fn-19-P1983_567481:4-nf] And they are possible if He wills them; for Luke tells us that He said, \"Father, if Thou be willing, remove[fn-19-P1984_567606:5-nf] this cup from me.\" The Holy Spirit, therefore, apportioned among the evangelists, makes up the full account of our Saviour's whole disposition by the expressions of these several narrators together. He does not, then, ask of the Father what the Father wills not. For the words, \"If Thou be willing,\" were demonstrative of subjection and docility,[fn-19-P1985_567967:6-nf] not of ignorance or hesitancy. For this reason, the other scripture says, \"All things are possible unto Thee.\" And Matthew again admirably describes the submission and humility[fn-19-P1986_568161:7-nf] when he says, \"If it be possible.\" For unless I adapt the sense in this way,[fn-19-P1987_568412:8-nf] some will perhaps assign an impious signification to this expression, \"If it be possible; \"as if there were anything impossible for God to do, except that only which He does not will to do.

For John, who has given us the record of the sublimest and divinest of the Saviour's words and deeds, heard Him speak thus: \"And the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it? \"[fn-19-P1989_569115:10-nf] Now, to drink the cup was to discharge the ministry and the whole economy of trial with fortitude, to follow and fulfil the Father's determination, and to surmount all apprehensions. And the exclamation, \"Why hast Thou forsaken me? \"was in due accordance with the requests He had previously made: Why is it that death has been in conjunction with me all along up till now, and that I bear not yet the cup?
