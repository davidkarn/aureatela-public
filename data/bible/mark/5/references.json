Hence, just as we arrive at sin by three steps,-suggestion, pleasure, consent,-so of sin itself there are three varieties,-in heart, in deed, in habit,-as it were, three deaths: one, as it were, in the house, i.e. when we consent to lust in the heart; a second now, as it were, brought forth outside the gate, when assent goes forward into action; a third, when the mind is pressed down by the force of bad habit, as if by a mound of earth, and is now, as it were, rotting in the sepulchre. And whoever reads the Gospel perceives that our Lord raised to life these three varieties of the dead. And perhaps he reflects what differences may be found in the very word of Him who raises them, when He says on one occasion, \"Damsel, arise;\"[fn-3-P387_106452:112-nf] on another, \"Young man,[fn-3-P388_106495:113-nf] I say unto thee, Arise ;\"[fn-3-P389_106558:114-nf] and when on another occasion He groaned in the spirit, and wept, and again groaned, and then afterwards \"cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.\"[fn-3-P390_106731:115-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":39,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"445","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"6. Spare yourself, I beseech you, spare Blaesilla, who now reigns with Christ; at least spare Eustochium, whose tender years and inexperience depend on you for guidance and instruction. Now does the devil rage and complain that he is set at naught, because he sees one of your children exalted in triumph. The victory which he failed to win over her that is gone he hopes to obtain over her who still remains. Too great affection towards one's children is disaffection towards God. Abraham gladly prepares to slay his only son, and do you complain if one child out of several has received her crown? I cannot say what I am going to say without a groan. When you were carried fainting out of the funeral procession, whispers such as these were audible in the crowd. \"Is not this what we have often said. She weeps for her daughter, killed with fasting. She wanted her to marry again, that she might have grandchildren. How long must we refrain from driving these detestable monks out of Rome? Why do we not stone them or hurl them into the Tiber? They have misled this unhappy lady; that she is not a nun from choice is clear. No heathen mother ever wept for her children as she does for Blaesilla.\" What sorrow, think you, must not Christ have endured when He listened to such words as these! And how triumphantly must Satan have exulted, eager as he is to snatch your soul! Luring you with the claims of a grief which seems natural and right, and always keeping before you the image of Blaesilla, his aim is to slay the mother of the victress, and then to fall upon her forsaken sister. I do not speak thus to terrify you. The Lord is my witness that I address you now as though I were standing at His judgment seat. Tears which have no meaning are an object of abhorrence. Yours are detestable tears, sacrilegious tears, unbelieving tears; for they know no limits, and bring you to the verge of death. You shriek and cry out as though on fire within, and do your best to put an end to yourself. But to you and others like you Jesus comes in His mercy and says: \"Why weepest thou? the damsel is not dead but sleepeth.\"[fn-12-P1261_275187:853-nf] The bystanders may laugh him to scorn; such unbelief is worthy of the Jews. If you prostrate yourself in grief at your daughter's tomb you too will hear the chiding of the angel, \"Why seek ye the living among the dead?\"[fn-12-P1262_275426:854-nf] It was because Mary Magdalene had done this that when she recognized the Lord's voice calling her and fell at His feet, He said to her: \"Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father;\"[fn-12-P1263_275639:855-nf] that is to say, you are not worthy to touch, as risen, one whom you suppose still in the tomb.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":5,"verse":41,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"698","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"7. That secular and church writers should have adopted this line need not surprise us when we consider that the translators of the Septuagint,[fn-23-P2351_597144:1672-nf] the evangelists, and the apostles, have done the same in dealing with the sacred writings. We read in Mark[fn-23-P2352_597290:1673-nf] of the Lord saying Talitha cumi and it is immediately added \"which is interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.\" The evangelist may he charged with falsehood for having added the words \"I say unto thee\" for the Hebrew is only \"Damsel arise.\" To emphasize this and to give the impression of one calling and commanding he has added \"I say unto thee.\" Again in Matthew[fn-23-P2353_597680:1674-nf] when the thirty pieces of silver are returned by the traitor Judas and the potter's field is purchased with them, it is written:-\"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken of by Jeremy the prophet, saying, \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him that was valued which[fn-23-P2354_598013:1675-nf] they of the children of Israel did value, and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.\" This passage is not found in Jeremiah at all but in Zechariah, in quite different words and an altogether different order. In fact the Vulgate renders it as follows:-\"And I will say unto them, If it is good in your sight, give ye me a price or refuse it: So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver. And the Lord said unto me, Put them into the melting furnace and consider if it is tried as I have been tried by them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver and cast them into the house of the Lord.\"[fn-23-P2355_598663:1676-nf] It is evident that the rendering of the Septuagint differs widely from the quotation of the evangelist. In the Hebrew also, though the sense is the same, the words are quite different and differently arranged. It says: \"And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and, if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver. And the Lord said unto me, Cast it unto the potter;[fn-23-P2356_599102:1677-nf] a goodly price that I was priced at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver and cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord.\"[fn-23-P2357_599262:1678-nf] They may accuse the apostle of falsifying his version seeing that it agrees neither with the Hebrew nor with the translators of the Septuagint: and worse than this, they may say that he has mistaken the author's name putting down Jeremiah when it should be Zechariah. Far be it from us to speak thus of a follower[fn-23-P2358_599617:1679-nf] of Christ, who made it his care to formulate dogmas rather than to hunt for words and syllables. To take another instance from Zechariah, the evangelist John quotes from the Hebrew, \"They shall look on him whom they pierced,\"[fn-23-P2359_599865:1680-nf] for which we read in the Septuagint, \"And they shall look upon me because they have mocked me,\" and in the Latin version, \"And they shall look upon me for the things which they have mocked or insulted.\" Here the evangelist, the Septuagint, and our own version[fn-23-P2360_600163:1681-nf] all differ; yet the divergence of language is atoned by oneness of spirit. In Matthew again we read of the Lord preaching flight to the apostles and confirming His counsel with a passage from Zechariah. \"It is written,\" he says, \"I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.\"[fn-23-P2361_600583:1682-nf] But in the Septuagint and in the Hebrew it reads differently, for it is not God who speaks, as the evangelist makes out, but the prophet who appeals to God the Father saying:-\"Smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.\" In this instance according to my judgment-and I have some careful critics with me-the evangelist is guilty of a fault in presuming to ascribe to God what are the words of the prophet. Again the same evangelist writes that at the warning of an angel Joseph took the young child and his mother and went into Egypt and remained there till the death of Herod; \"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.\"[fn-23-P2362_601326:1683-nf] The Latin manuscripts do not so give the passage, but in Hosea[fn-23-P2363_601415:1684-nf] the true Hebrew text has the following:-\"When Israel was a child then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.\" Which the Septuagint renders thus:-\"When Israel was a child then I loved him, and called his sons out of Egypt.\" Are they[fn-23-P2364_601674:1685-nf] altogether to be rejected because they have given another turn to a passage which refers primarily to the mystery of Christ? Or should we not rather pardon the shortcomings of the translators on the score of their human frailty according to the saying of James, \"In many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word the same is a perfect man and able also to bridle the whole body.\"[fn-23-P2365_602116:1686-nf] Once more it is written in the pages of the same evangelist, \"And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.\"[fn-23-P2366_602343:1687-nf] Let these word fanciers and nice critics of all composition tell us where they have read the words; and if they cannot, let me tell them that they are in Isaiah.[fn-23-P2367_602529:1688-nf] For in the place where we read and translate, \"There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots,\"[fn-23-P2368_602695:1689-nf] in the Hebrew idiom it is written thus, \"There shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse and a Nazarene shall grow from his root.\" How can the Septuagint leave out the word `Nazarene,' if it is unlawful to substitute one word for another? It is sacrilege either to conceal or to set at naught a mystery.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":5,"verse":39,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"739","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"2. What shall I do then? Shall I join my tears to yours? The apostle forbids me for he speaks of dead Christians as \"them which are asleep.\"[fn-25-P2527_647792:1804-nf] So too in the gospel the Lord says, \"the damsel is not dead but sleepeth,\"[fn-25-P2528_647893:1805-nf] and Lazarus when he is raised from the dead is said to have been asleep.[fn-25-P2529_647987:1806-nf] No, I will be glad and rejoice that \"speedily he was taken away lest that wickedness should alter his understanding\" for \"his soul pleased the Lord.\"[fn-25-P2530_648159:1807-nf] But though I am loth to give way and combat my feelings, tears flow down my cheeks, and in spite of the teachings of virtue and the hope of the resurrection a passion of regret crushes my too yielding mind.

Thou didst carry Him as one dead, that the world's storm might be stilled and our Nineveh saved by His preaching. He, yes He, conquered thee, He slew thee, that fugitive prophet who left His home, gave up His inheritance and surrendered his dear life into the hands of those who sought it. He it was who of old threatened thee in Hoses: \"O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction.\"[fn-25-P2532_649158:1809-nf] By His death thou art dead; by His death we live.

And now do you in your turn answer me these questions. How do you explain the fact that Thomas felt the hands of the risen Lord and beheld His side pierced by the spear?[fn-41-P4127_1112589:2977-nf] And the fact that Peter saw the Lord standing on the shore[fn-41-P4128_1112670:2978-nf] and eating a piece of a roasted fish and a honeycomb.[fn-41-P4129_1112764:2979-nf] If He stood, He must certainly have had feet. If He pointed to His wounded side He must have also had chest and belly for to these the sides are attached and without them they cannot be. If He spoke, He must have used a tongue and palate and teeth. For as the bow strikes the strings, so to produce vocal sound does the tongue come in contact with the teeth. If His hands were felt, it follows that He must have had arms as well. Since therefore it is admitted that He had all the members which go to make up the body, He must have also had the whole body formed of them, and that not a woman's but a man's; that is to say, He rose again in the sex in which He died. And if you cavil farther and say: We shall eat then, I suppose, after the resurrection; or How can a solid and material body enter in contrary to its nature through closed doors? you shall receive from me this reply. Do not for this matter of food find fault with belief in the resurrection: for our Lord after raising the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue commanded food to be given her.[fn-41-P4130_1113846:2980-nf] And Lazarus who had been dead four days is described as sitting at meat with Him,[fn-41-P4131_1113950:2981-nf] the object in both cases being to shew that the resurrection was real and not merely apparent. And if from our Lord's entering in through closed doors[fn-41-P4132_1114123:2982-nf] you strive to prove that His body was spiritual and aerial, He must have had this spiritual body even before He suffered; since-contrary to the nature of heavy bodies-He was able to walk upon the sea.[fn-41-P4133_1114348:2983-nf] The apostle Peter also must be believed to have had a spiritual body for he also walked upon the waters with buoyant step.[fn-41-P4134_1114495:2984-nf] The true explanation is that when anything is done against nature, it is a manifestation of God's might and power. And to shew plainly that in these great signs our attention is asked not to a change in nature but to the almighty power of God, he who by faith had walked on water began to sink for the want of it and would have done so had not the Lord lifted him up with the reproving words, \"O thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt?\"[fn-41-P4135_1114965:2985-nf] I wonder that you can display such effrontery when the Lord Himself said, \"reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless but believing.\"[fn-41-P4136_1115199:2986-nf] and in another place, \"behold my hands and my feet that it is I myself: handle me and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have. And when he had thus spoken he shewed them his hands and his feet.\"[fn-41-P4137_1115454:2987-nf] You hear Him speak of bones and flesh, of feet and hands; and yet you want to palm off on me the bubbles and airy nothings of which the stoics rave![fn-41-P4138_1115662:2988-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":5,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"60","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"And again in the Epistle to the Colossians, to them that have not the knowledge of the Only Begotten, there is mention of him that holdeth \"the head,\" that is, Christ, \"from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered increaseth with the increase of God.\"[fn-12-P1205_285115:48-nf] And that Christ is the head of the Church we have learned in another passage, when the apostle says \"gave him to be the head over all things to the Church,\"[fn-12-P1206_285294:49-nf] and \"of his fulness have all we received.\"[fn-12-P1207_285355:50-nf] And the Lord Himself says \"He shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.\"[fn-12-P1208_285451:51-nf] In a word, the diligent reader will perceive that \"of whom\" is used in diverse manners.[fn-12-P1209_285556:52-nf] For instance, the Lord says, \"I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.\"[fn-12-P1210_285647:53-nf] Similarly we have frequently observed \"of whom\" used of the Spirit. \"He that soweth to the spirit,\" it is said, \"shall of the spirit reap life ever!asting.\"[fn-12-P1211_285859:54-nf] John too writes, \"Hereby we know that he abideth in ns by(e0k) the spirit which he hath given us.\"[fn-12-P1212_286189:55-nf] \"That which is conceived in her,\" says the angel, \"is of the Holy Ghost,\"[fn-12-P1213_286280:56-nf] and the Lord says \"that which is born of the spirit is spirit.\"[fn-12-P1214_286365:57-nf] Such then is the case so far.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":5,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_19_vii_on_modesty_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Now we must proceed, in the case of the prodigal son, to consider first that which is more useful; for no adjustment of examples, albeit in the most nicely-poised balance, shall be admitted if it shall prove to be most hurtful to salvation.

But the whole system of salvation, as it is comprised in the maintenance of discipline, we see is being subverted by that interpretation which is affected by the opposite side. For if it is a Christian who, after wandering far from his Father, squanders, by living heathenishly, the \"substance\" received from God his Father,-(the substance), of course, of baptism-(the substance), of course, of the Holy Spirit, and (in consequence) of eternal hope; if, stripped of his mental \"goods,\" he has even handed his service over to the prince of the world[fn-14-P1416_398528:103-nf] -who else but the devil?-and by him being appointed over the business of \"feeding swine\"-of tending unclean spirits, to wit-has recovered his senses so as to return to his Father,-the result will be, that, not adulterers and fornicators, but idolaters, and blasphemers, and renegades, and every class of apostates, will by this parable make satisfaction to the Father; and in this way (it may) rather (be said that) the whole \"substance\" of the sacrament is most truly wasted away. For who will fear to squander what he has the power of afterwards recovering? Who will be careful to preserve to perpetuity what he will be able to lose not to perpetuity? Security in sin is likewise an appetite for it. Therefore the apostate withal will recover his former \"garment,\" the robe of the Holy Spirit; and a renewal of the \"ring,\" the sign and seal of baptism; and Christ will again be \"slaughtered; \"[fn-14-P1417_399474:104-nf] and he will recline on that couch from which such as are unworthily clad are wont to be lifted by the torturers, and cast away into darkness,[fn-14-P1418_399701:105-nf] -much more such as have been stripped. It is therefore a further step if it is not expedient, (any more than reasonable), that the story of the prodigal son should apply to a Christian. Wherefore, if the image of a \"son\" is not entirely suitable to a Jew either, our interpretation shall be simply governed with an eye to the object the Lord had in view. The Lord had come, of course, to save that which \"had perished; \"[fn-14-P1419_400152:106-nf] \"a Physician.\" necessary to \"the sick\" \"more than to the whole.\"[fn-14-P1420_400245:107-nf] This fact He was in the habit both of typifying in parables and preaching in direct statements. Who among men \"perishes,\" who falls from health, but he who knows not the Lord? Who is \"safe and sound,\" but he who knows the Lord? These two classes-\"brothers\" by birth-this parable also will signify. See whether the heathen have in God the Father the \"substance\" of origin, and wisdom, and natural power of Godward recognition; by means of which power the apostle withal notes that \"in the wisdom of God, the world through wisdom knew not God,\"[fn-14-P1421_400834:108-nf] -(wisdom) which, of course, it had received originally from God. This (\"substance\"), accordingly, he \"squandered; \"having been cast by his moral habits far from the Lord, amid the errors and allurements and appetites of the world,[fn-14-P1422_401086:109-nf] where, compelled by hunger after truth,[fn-14-P1423_401142:110-nf] he handed himself over to the prince of this age. He set him over \"swine,\" to feed that flock familiar to demons,[fn-14-P1424_401278:111-nf] where he would not be master of a supply of vital food, and at the same time would see others (engaged) in a divine work, having abundance of heavenly bread. He remembers his Father, God; he returns to Him when he has been satisfied; he receives again the pristine \"garment,\"-the condition, to wit, which Adam by transgression had lost. The \"ring\" also he is then Wont to receive for the first time, wherewith, after being interrogated,[fn-14-P1425_401779:112-nf] he publicly seals the agreement of faith, and thus thenceforward feeds upon the \"fatness\" of the Lord's body,-the Eucharist, to wit. This will be the prodigal son, who never in days bygone was thrifty; who was from the first prodigal, because not from the first a Christian. Him withal, returning from the world to the Father's embraces, the Pharisees mourned over, in the persons of the \"publicans and sinners.\" And accordingly to this point alone the elder brother's envy is adapted: not because the Jews were innocent, and obedient to God, but because they envied the nation salvation; being plainly they who ought to have been \"ever with\" the Father. And of course it is immediately over the first calling of the Christian that the Jew groans, not over his second restoration: for the former reflects its rap even upon the heathen; but the latter, which takes place in the churches, is not known even to the Jews.

My opponent has dared to maintain that our Lord was called by the Pharisees a wine-bibber and a glutton: and from the fact of His going to marriage feasts and from His not despising the banquets of sinners, I am to infer His wishes respecting ourselves.

For whenever He raised anyone from the dead He[fn-67-P6786_2143957:175-nf] ordered that food should be given him to eat, lest the resurrection should be thought a delusion. And this is why Lazarus after his resurrection is[fn-67-P6787_2144263:176-nf] described as being at the feast with our Lord. We do not deny that fish and other kinds of flesh, if we choose, may be taken as food; but as we prefer virginity to marriage, so do we esteem fasting and spirituality above meats and full-bloodedness. And if Peter[fn-67-P6788_2144548:177-nf] before dinner went to the supper chamber at the sixth hour, a chance fit of hunger does not prejudice fasting. For, if this were so, because our Lord[fn-67-P6789_2144748:178-nf] at the sixth hour sat weary on the well of Samaria and wished to drink, all must of necessity, whether they so desire or not, drink at that time. Possibly it was the Sabbath, or the Lord's day, and he hungered at the sixth hour after two or three days' fasting; for I could never believe that the Apostle, if he had eaten a dinner only one day previous and had been blown out with a great meal, would have been hungry by noon next day. But if he did dine the day previous, and was hungry next day before luncheon, I do not think that a man who was so soon hungry ate until he was satisfied. Again, God by the mouth of Isaiah says what fast He did not choose:[fn-67-P6790_2145430:179-nf] \"In the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and afflict the lowly: ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness. it is not such a fast that I have chosen, saith the Lord.\" What kind He has chosen He thus teaches: \"Deal thy bread to the hungry, and bring the houseless poor into thy house. When thou seest the naked cover him, and hide not thyself from thine own flesh.\" He did not therefore reject fasting, but showed what He would have it to be: for that bodily hunger is not pleasing to God which is made null and void by strife, and plunder, and lust. If God does not desire fasting, how is it that in[fn-67-P6791_2146086:180-nf] Leviticus He commands the whole people in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, to fast until the evening, and threatens that he who does not afflict his soul shall die and be cut off from his people? How is it that the[fn-67-P6792_2146334:181-nf] graves of lust where the people fell in their devotion to flesh remain even to this day in the wilderness? Do we not read that the stupid people gorged themselves with quails until the wrath of God came upon them? Why was the man of God at whose prophecy the hand of King Jeroboam withered, and who ate contrary to the command of God,[fn-67-P6793_2146738:182-nf] immediately smitten? Strange that the lion which left the ass safe and sound should not spare the prophet just risen from his meal!He who, while he was fasting, had wrought miracles, no sooner ate a meal than he paid the penalty for the gratification. Joel also cries aloud:[fn-67-P6794_2147038:183-nf] \"Sanctify a fast, proclaim a time of healing,\" that it might appear that a fast is sanctified by other works, and that a holy fast avails for the cure of sin. Moreover, just as true virginity is not prejudiced by the counterfeit professions of the virgins of the devil, so neither is true fasting by the periodic fast and perpetual abstinence from certain kinds of food on the part of the worshippers of Isis and Cybele, particularly when a fast from bread is made up for by feasting on flesh. And just as the signs of Moses were imitated by the signs of the Egyptians which were in reality no signs at all, for the rod of Moses swallowed up the rods of the magicians: so when the devil tries to be the rival of God this does not prove that our religion is superstitious, but that we are negligent, since we refuse to do what even men of the world see clearly to be good.","title":"Book II.","author":false},{"chapter":5,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_23_ix_de_fuga_in_persecutione_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"ANF-04","text":"2. If, because injustice is not from God, but from the devil, and persecution consists of injustice (for what more unjust than that the bishops of the true God, that all the followers of the truth, should be dealt with after the manner o the vilest criminals?), persecution therefore seems to proceed from the devil, by whom the injustice which constitutes persecution is perpetrated, we ought to know, as you have neither persecution without the injustice of the devil, nor the trial of faith without persecution, that the injustice necessary for the trial of faith does not give a warrant for persecution, but supplies an agency; that in reality, in reference to the trial of faith, which is the reason of persecution, the will of God goes first, but that as the instrument of persecution, which is the way of trial, the injustice of the devil follows. For in other respects, too, injustice in proportion to the enmity it displays against righteousness affords occasion for attestations of that to which it is opposed as an enemy, that so righteousness may be perfected in injustice, as strength is perfected in weakness.[fn-19-P1936_571808:4-nf] For the weak things of the world have been chosen by God to confound the strong, and the foolish things of the world to confound its wisdom.[fn-19-P1937_571967:5-nf] Thus even injustice is employed, that righteousness may be approved in putting unrighteousness to shame. Therefore, since the service is not of free-will, but of subjection (for persecution is the appointment of the Lord for the trial of faith, but its ministry is the injustice of the devil, supplied that persecution may be got up), we believe that persecution comes to pass, no question, by the devil's agency, but not by the devil's origination. Satan will not be at liberty to do anything against the servants of the living God unless the Lord grant leave, either that He may overthrow Satan himself by the faith of the elect which proves victorious in the trial, or in the face of the world show that apostatizers to the devil's cause have been in reality His servants. You have the case of Job, whom the devil, unless he had received authority from God, could not have visited with trial, not even, in fact, in his property, unless the Lord had said, \"Behold, all that he has I put at your disposal; but do not stretch out your hand against himself.\"[fn-19-P1938_573046:6-nf] In short, he would not even have stretched it out, unless afterwards, at his request, the Lord had granted him this permission also, saying, \"Behold, I deliver him to you; only preserve his life.\" So he asked in the case of the apostles likewise an opportunity to tempt them, having it only by special allowance, since the Lord in the Gospel says to Peter, \"Behold, Satan asked that he might sift you as grain; but I have prayed for you that your faith fail not; \"[fn-19-P1939_573525:7-nf] that is, that the devil should not have power granted him sufficient to endanger his faith. Whence it is manifest that both things belong to God shaking of faith as well as the shielding of it, when both are sought from Him-the shaking by the devil, the shielding by the Son. And certainly, when the Son of God has faith's protection absolutely committed to Him, beseeching it of the Father, from whom He receives all power in heaven and on earth, how entirely out of the question is it that the devil should have the assailing of it in his own power! But in the prayer prescribed to us, when we say to our Father, \"Lead us not into temptation \"[fn-19-P1940_574193:8-nf] (now what greater temptation is there than persecution?), we acknowledge that that comes to pass by His will whom we beseech to exempt us from it. For this is what follows, \"But deliver us from the wicked one,\" that is, do not lead us into temptation by giving us up to the wicked one, for then are we delivered from the power of the devil, when we are not handed over to him to be tempted. Nor would the devil's legion have had power over the herd of swine[fn-19-P1941_574668:9-nf] unless they had got it from God; so far are they from having power over the sheep of God. I may say that the bristles of the swine, too, were then counted by God, not to speak of the hairs of holy men. The devil, it must be owned, seems indeed to have power-in this case really his own-over those who do not belong to God, the nations being once for all counted by God as a drop of the bucket, and as the dust of the threshing-floor, and as the spittle of the mouth, and so thrown open to the devil as, in a sense, a free possession. But against those who belong to the household of God he may not do ought as by any right of his own, because the cases marked out in Scripture show when-that is, for what reasons-he may touch them. For either, with a view to their being approved, the power of trial is granted to him, challenged or challenging, as in the instances already referred to, or, to secure an opposite result, the sinner is handed over to him, as though he were an executioner to whom belonged the inflicting of punishment, as in the case of Saul. \"And the Spirit of the Lord,\" says Scripture, \"departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled and stifled him; \"[fn-19-P1942_575871:10-nf] or the design is to humble, as the apostle tells us, that there was given him a stake, the messenger of Satan, to buffet him;[fn-19-P1943_576019:11-nf] and even this son of thing is not permitted in the case of holy men, unless it be that at the same time strength of endurance may be perfected in weakness. For the apostle likewise delivered Phygellus and Hermogenes over to Satan that by chastening they might be taught not to blaspheme.[fn-19-P1944_576327:12-nf] You see, then, that the devil receives more suitably power even from the servants of God; so far is he from having it by any fight of his own.","title":"IX.

Still keeping by the order of time, Matthew next continues to the following effect: \"While He spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped Him, saying, My daughter is even now dead; but come and lay Thy hand upon her, and she shall live;\" and so on, until we come to the words, \"and the maid arose. And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.\"[fn-17-P1748_714071:284-nf] The other two, namely, Mark and Luke, in like manner give this same account, only they do not keep by the same order now. For they bring up this narrative in a different place, and insert it in another connection; to wit, at the point where He crosses the take and returns from the country of the Gerasenes, after casting out the devils and permitting them to go into the swine. Thus Mark introduces it, after he has related what took place among the Gerasenes, in the following manner: \"And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto Him: and He was nigh unto the sea. And there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw Him, he fell at His feet,\" etc.[fn-17-P1749_714827:285-nf] By this, then, we are certainly to understand that the occurrence in connection with the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue did take place after Jesus had passed across the lake again in the ship.[fn-17-P1750_715050:286-nf] It does not, however, appear from the words themselves how long after that passage this thing happened. But that some time did elapse is clear. For had there not been an interval, no period would be left within which those circumstances might fall which Matthew has just related in the matter of the feast in his house. These, indeed, he has told after the fashion of the evangelists, as if they were the story of another person's doings. But they are the story really of what took place in his own case, and at his own house. And after that narrative, what follows in the immediate context is nothing else than this notice of the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue. For he has constructed the whole recital in such a manner, that the mode of transition from one thing to the other has itself indicated with sufficient clearness that the words immediately, following give the narrative of what actually took place in immediate consecution. For after mentioning, in connection with the former incident, those words which Jesus spake with respect to the new cloth and the new wine, he has subjoined these other words, without any interruption in the narrative, namely, \"While He spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler.\" And this shows that, if the person approached Him while He was speaking these things, nothing else either done or said by Him could have intervened. In Mark's account, on the other hand, the place is quite apparent, as we have already pointed out, where other things [left unrecorded by him] might very well have come in. The case is much the same also with Luke, who, when he proceeds to follow up his version of the story of the miracle wrought among the Gerasenes, by giving his account of the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue, does not pass on to that in any such way as to place it in antagonism with Matthew's version, who, by his words, \"While He yet spake these things,\" gives us plainly to understand that the occurrence took place after those parables about the cloth and the wine. For when he has concluded his statement of what happened among the Gerasenes, Luke passes to the next subject in the following manner; \"And it came to pass that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received Him; for they were all waiting for Him. And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue, and he fell down at Jesus' feet,\" and so on.[fn-17-P1751_717695:287-nf] Thus we are given to understand that the crowd did indeed receive Jesus forthwith on the said occasion: for He was the person for whose return they, were waiting. But what is conveyed in the words which are directly added, \"And, behold, there came a man whose name was Jairus,\" is not to be taken to have occurred literally in immediate succession. On the contrary, the feast with the publicans, as Matthew records it, took place before that. For Matthew connects this present incident with that feast in such a way as to make it impossible for us to suppose that any other sequence of events can be the correct order.[fn-17-P1752_718339:288-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":67,"source_paragraph":"276","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"125. Matthew continues thus: \"And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed Him.

Consequently there can be little doubt that this Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, had fallen from some position of great prosperity, and was now regarded as an object of the most notorious and the most remarkable wretchedness, because, in addition to being blind, he had also to sit begging. And this is also the reason, then, why Mark has chosen to mention only the one whose restoration to sight acquired for the miracle a fame as widespread as was the notoriety which the man's misfortune itself had gained.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_15_book_iv_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"5.

The rest of the contents of this section we have already discussed. Mark continues in these terms: \"And He said unto them, Come ye apart into a desert place, and rest a while;\" and so on, down to the words, \"But the more He charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it; and were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: He maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.\"[fn-27-P2764_1222155:13-nf] In all this there is nothing which presents the appearance of any want of harmony between Mark and Luke; and the whole of the above we have already considered, when we were comparing these evangelists with Matthew. At the same time, we must make sure that no one shall suppose that the last statement, which I have cited here from Mark's Gospel, is in antagonism with the entire body of the evangelists, who, in reporting most of His other deeds and words, make it plain that He knew what went on in men; that is to say, that their thoughts and desires could not be concealed from Him. Thus John puts it very clearly in the following passage: \"But Jesus did not commit Himself unto them, because He knew all men, and needed not that any should testify of man; for He knew what was in man.\"[fn-27-P2765_1222971:14-nf] But what wonder is it that He should discern the present thoughts of men, if He announced beforehand to Peter the thought which he was to entertain in the future,[fn-27-P2766_1223156:15-nf] but which he certainly had not then, at the very time when he was boldly declaring himself ready to die for Him, or with Him?[fn-27-P2767_1223434:16-nf] This being the case, then, how can it fail to appear as if this knowledge and foreknowledge, which He possessed in so supreme a measure, is contradicted by Mark's statement, \"He charged them that they should tell no man: but the more He charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it\"? For if He, as one who held in His own knowledge all the intentions of men, both present and future was aware that they would publish it all the more the more He charged them not to publish it, what purpose could He have in giving them such a charge?

Now, Bethany, as the same evangelist tells us,[fn-68-P6878_1281319:116-nf] was the town of Lazarus, and of Martha and Mary; it is fifteen stadia from Jerusalem, anti the river Jordan is about a hundred and eighty stadia distant from it. Nor is there any other place of the same name in the neighbourhood of the Jordan, but they say that Bethabara is pointed out on the banks of the Jordan, and that John is said to have baptized there. The etymology of the name, too, corresponds with the baptism of him who made ready for the Lord a people prepared for Him; for it yields the meaning \"House of preparation,\" while Bethany means \"House of obedience.\" Where else was it fitting that he should baptize, who was sent as a messenger before the face of the Christ, to prepare His way before Him, but at the House of preparation? And what more fitting home for Mary, who chose the good part,[fn-68-P6879_1282154:117-nf] which was not taken away from her, and for Martha, who was cumbered for the reception of Jesus, and for their brother, who is called the friend of the Saviour, than Bethany, the House of obedience?

But Gergesa, from which the name Gergesenes is taken, is an old town in the neighbourhood of the lake now called Tiberias, and on the edge of it there is a steep place abutting on the lake, from which it is pointed out that the swine were cast down by the demons. Now, the meaning of Gergesa is \"dwelling of the casters-out,\" and it contains a prophetic reference to the conduct towards the Saviour of the citizens of those places, who \"besought Him to depart out of their coasts.\" The same inaccuracy with regard to proper names is also to be observed in many passages of the law and the prophets, as we have been at pains to learn from the Hebrews, comparing our own copies with theirs which have the confirmation of the versions, never subjected to corruption, of Aquila and Theodotion and Symmachus. We add a few instances to encourage students to pay more attention to such points. One of the sons of Levi,[fn-68-P6881_1284318:119-nf] the first, is called Geson in most copies, instead of Gerson.

Only those who live purely being true priests of God. Wherefore, of all the circumcised tribes, those anointed to be high priests, and kings, and prophets, were reckoned more holy. Whence He commands them not to touch dead bodies, or approach the dead; not that the body was polluted, but that sin and disobedience were incarnate, and embodied, and dead, and therefore abominable. It was only, then, when a father and mother, a son and daughter died, that the priest was allowed to enter, because these were related only by flesh and seed, to whom the priest was indebted for the immediate cause of his entrance into life. And they purify themselves seven days, the period in which Creation was consummated. For on the seventh day the rest is celebrated; and on the eighth he brings a propitiation, as is written in Ezekiel, according to which propitiation the promise is to be received.[fn-70-P7084_2168258:232-nf] And the perfect propitiation, I take it, is that propitious faith in the Gospel which is by the law and the prophets, and the purity which shows itself in universal obedience, with the abandonment of the things of the world; in order to that grateful surrender of the tabernacle, which results from the enjoyment of the soul. Whether, then, the time be that which through the seven periods enumerated returns to the chiefest rest,[fn-70-P7085_2168712:233-nf] or the seven heavens, which some reckon one above the other; or whether also the fixed sphere which borders on the intellectual world be called the eighth, the expression denotes that the Gnostic ought to rise out of the sphere of creation and of sin. After these seven days, sacrifices are offered for sins. For there is still fear of change, and it touches the seventh circle. The righteous Job says: \"Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return there; \"[fn-70-P7086_2169228:234-nf] not naked of possessions, for that were a trivial and common thing; but, as a just man, he departs naked of evil and sin, and of the unsightly shape which follows those who have led bad lives. For this was what was said, \"Unless ye be converted, and become as children,\"[fn-70-P7087_2169517:235-nf] pure in flesh, holy in soul by abstinence from evil deeds; showing that He would have us to be such as also He generated us from our mother-the water.[fn-70-P7088_2169691:236-nf] For the intent of one generation succeeding another is to immortalize by progress. \"But the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.\"[fn-70-P7089_2169843:237-nf] That purity in body and soul which the Gnostic partakes of, the all-wise Moses indicated, by employing repetition in describing the incorruptibility of body and of soul in the person of Rebecca, thus: \"Now the virgin was fair, and man had not known her.\"[fn-70-P7090_2170137:238-nf] And Rebecca, interpreted, means \"glory of God; \"and the glory of God is immortality.[fn-70-P7091_2170244:239-nf] This is in reality righteousness, not to desire other things, but to be entirely the consecrated temple of the Lord.

But those who are unacquainted with their habits think that they only kill themselves now that all the mass of the people are freed from the fearful madness of their usurped dominion, in virtue of the laws which have been passed for the preservation of unity. But those who know what they were accustomed to do before the passing of the laws, do not wonder at their deaths, but call to mind their character; and especially how vast crowds of them used to come in procession to the most frequented ceremonies of the pagans, while the worship of idols still continued,-not with the view of breaking the idols, but that they might be put to death by those who worshipped them. For if they had sought to break the idols under the sanction of legitimate authority, they might, in case of anything happening to them, have had some shadow of a claim to be considered martyrs; but their only object in coming was, that while the idols remained uninjured, they themselves might meet with death. For it was the general custom of the strongest youths among the worshippers of idols, for each of them to offer in sacrifice to the idols themselves any victims that he might have slain. Some went so far as to offer themselves for slaughter to any travellers whom they met with arms, using violent threats that they would murder them if they failed to meet with death at their hands. Sometimes, too, they extorted with violence from any passing judge that they should be put to death by the executioners, or by the officer of his court. And hence we have a story, that a certain judge played a trick upon them, by ordering them to be bound and led away, as though for execution, and so escaped their violence, without injury to himself or them. Again, it was their daily sport to kill themselves, by throwing themselves over precipices, or into the water, or into the fire. For the devil taught them these three modes of suicide, so that, when they wished to die, and could not find any one whom they could terrify into slaying them with his sword, they threw themselves over the rocks, or committed themselves to the fire or the eddying pool. But who can be thought to have taught them this, having gained possession of their hearts, but he who actually suggested to our Saviour Himself as a duty sanctioned by the law, that He should throw Himself down from a pinnacle of the temple?[fn-59-P5923_2864650:30-nf] And his suggestion they would surely have thrust far from them, had they carried Christ, as their Master, in their hearts.

And as He is going, it is announced that she is dead; and as though He would now be only wearying Himself in vain, word was brought to her father, \"Thy daughter is dead, why weariest thou the Master any further?\"[fn-51-P5147_2188192:10-nf] But He went on, and said to the father of the damsel, \"Be not afraid, only believe.\"[fn-51-P5148_2188294:11-nf] He comes to the house, and finds the customary funeral obsequies already prepared, and He says to them, \"Weep not, for the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.\"[fn-51-P5149_2188469:12-nf] He spake the truth; she was asleep; asleep, that is, in respect of Him, by whom she could be awakened. So awakening her, He restored her alive to her parents. So again He awakened that young man, the widow's son,[fn-51-P5150_2188699:13-nf] by whose case I have been now reminded to speak with you, Beloved, on this subject, as He Himself shall vouchsafe to give me power. Ye have just heard how he was awakened. The Lord \"came nigh to the city; and behold there was a dead man being carried out\" already beyond the gate. Moved with compassion, for that the mother, a widow and bereaved of her only son, was weeping, He did what ye have heard, saying, \"Young man, I say unto thee, Arise. He that was dead arose, and began to speak, and He restored him to his mother.\"[fn-51-P5151_2189245:14-nf] He awakened Lazarus likewise from the tomb. And in that case when the disciples with whom He was speaking knew that he was sick, He said (now \"Jesus loved him\"), \"Our friend Lazarus sleepeth.\" They thinking of the sick man's healthful sleep; say, \"Lord, if he sleep he is well.\" \"Then said Jesus,\" speaking now more plainly, I tell you, \"our friend Lazarus is dead.\"[fn-51-P5152_2189635:15-nf] And in both He said the truth; \"He is dead in respect of you, he is asleep in respect of Me.\"","title":"Sermon XLVIII.

If, then, the Lord in the greatness of His grace and mercy raiseth our souls to life, that we may not die for ever, we may well understand that those three dead persons whom He raised in the body, have some figurative significance of that resurrection of the soul which is effected by faith: He raised up the ruler of the synagogue's daughter, while still lying in the house;[fn-21-P2107_1300290:4-nf] He raised up the widow's young son, while being carried outside the gates of the city;[fn-21-P2108_1300396:5-nf] and He raised up Lazarus, when four days in the grave. Let each one give heed to his own soul: in sinning he dies: sin is the death of the soul. But sometimes sin is committed only in thought. Thou hast felt delight in what is evil, thou hast assented to its commission thou hast sinned; that assent has slain thee but the death is internal, because the evil thought had not yet ripened into action. The Lord intimated that He would raise such a soul to life, in raising that girl, who had not yet been carried forth to the burial, but was lying dead in the house, as if sin still lay concealed. But if thou hast not only harbored a feeling of delight in evil, but hast also done the evil thing, thou hast, so to speak, carried the dead outside the gate: thou art already without, and being carried to the tomb. Yet such an one also the Lord raised to life. and restored to his widowed mother. If thou hast sinned, repent, and the Lord will raise thee up, and restore thee to thy mother Church. The third example of death is Lazarus. A grievous kind of death it is, and is distinguished as a habit of wickedness. For it is one thing to fall into sin, another to form the habit of sinning. He who falls into sin, and straightway submits to correction, will be speedily restored to life; for he is not yet entangled in the habit, he is not yet laid in the tomb. But he who has become habituated to sin, is buried, and has it properly said of him, \"he stinketh;\" for his character, like some horrible smell, begins to be of the worst repute. Such are all who are habituated to crime, abandoned in morals. Thou sayest to such an one, Do not so. But when wilt thou be listened to by one on whom the earth is thus heaped, who is breeding corruption, and pressed down with the weight of habit? And yet the power of Christ was not unequal to the task of restoring such an one to life. We know, we have seen, we see every day men changing the very worst of habits, and adopting a better manner of life than that of those who blamed them. Thou detestedst such a man: look at the sister of Lazarus herself (if, indeed, it was she who anointed the Lord's feet with ointment, and wiped with her hair what she had washed with her tears), who had a better resurrection than her brother; she was delivered from the mighty burden of a sinful character. For she was a notorious sinner; and had it said of her, \"Her many sins are forgiven her, for she has loved much.\"[fn-21-P2109_1302867:6-nf] We see many such, we know many: let none despair, but let none presume in himself. Both the one and the other are sinful. Let thine unwillingness to despair take such a turn as to lead thee to make choice of Him in whom alone thou mayest well presume.","title":"Tractate XLIX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":35,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_95_sermon_lxxviii_cxxviii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"16","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"14.

But the Lord raised also the young man, the widow's son, when he was being carried out dead beyond the gate of the city.[fn-61-P6176_2622757:36-nf] So then I venture to say, Thou hast determined in thine heart, if thou call thyself back from thy deed, thou wilt be cured before thou put it into action.
