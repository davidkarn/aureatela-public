{"verses":["And they came over the strait of the sea, into the country of the\nGerasens.","And as he went out of the ship, immediately there met him out of\nthe monuments a man with an unclean spirit,","Who had his dwelling in the tombs, and no man now could bind him,\nnot even with chains.","For having been often bound with fetters and chains, he had burst\nthe chains, and broken the fetters in pieces, and no one could tame\nhim.","And he was always day and night in the monuments and in the\nmountains, crying and cutting himself with stones.","And seeing Jesus afar off, he ran and adored him.","And crying with a loud voice, he said:  What have I to do with\nthee, Jesus the Son of the most high God?  I adjure thee by God that\nthou torment me not.","For he said unto him:  Go out of the man, thou unclean spirit.","And he asked him:  What is thy name?  And he saith to him:  My name\nis Legion, for we are many.","And he besought him much, that he would not drive him away out of\nthe country.","And there was there near the mountain a great herd of swine,\nfeeding.","And the spirits besought him, saying:  Send us into the swine,\nthat we may enter into them.","And Jesus immediately gave them leave.  And the unclean spirits\ngoing out, entered into the swine:  and the herd with great violence was\ncarried headlong into the sea, being about two thousand, were stifled\nin the sea.","And they that fed them fled, and told it in the city and in the\nfields.  And they went out to see what was done:","And they came to Jesus, and they see him that was troubled with\nthe devil, sitting, clothed, and well in his wits, and they were\nafraid.","And they that had seen it, told them, in what manner he had been\ndealt with who had the devil; and concerning the swine.","And they began to pray him that he would depart from their\ncoasts.","And when he went up into the ship, he that had been troubled with\nthe devil, began to beseech him that he might be with him.","And he admitted him not, but saith him:  Go into thy house to thy\nfriends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee,\nand hath had mercy thee.","And he went his way, and began to publish in Decapolis how great\nthings Jesus had done for him:  and all men wondered.","And when Jesus had passed again in the ship over the strait, a\ngreat multitude assembled together unto him, and he was nigh unto the\nsea.","And there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue named Jairus:\nand seeing him, falleth down at his feet.","And he besought him much, saying:  My daughter is at the point of\ndeath, come, lay thy hand upon her, that she may be safe, and may live.","And he went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and\nthey thronged him.","And a woman who was under an issue of blood twelve years,","And had suffered many things from many physicians; and had spent\nall that she had, and was nothing the better, but rather worse,","When she had heard of Jesus, came in the crowd behind him, and\ntouched his garment.","For she said:  If I shall touch but his garment, I shall be whole.","And forthwith the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she\nfelt in her body that she was healed of the evil.","And immediately Jesus knowing in himself the virtue that had\nproceeded from him, turning to the multitude, said:  Who hath touched my\ngarments?","And his disciples said to him:  Thou seest the multitude thronging\nthee, and sayest thou who hath touched me?","And he looked about to see her who had done this.","But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in\nher, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.","And he said to her:  Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole:  go\nin peace, and be thou whole of thy disease.","While he was yet speaking, some come from the ruler of the\nsynagogue's house, saying:  Thy daughter is dead:  why dost thou trouble\nthe master any further?","But Jesus having heard the word that was spoken, saith to the\nruler of the synagogue:  Fear not, only believe.","And he admitted not any man to follow him, but Peter, and James,\nand John the brother of James.","And they cone to the house of the ruler of the synagogue; and he\nseeth a tumult, and people weeping and wailing much.","And going in, he saith to them Why make you this ado, and weep?\nthe damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.","And they laughed him to scorn.
