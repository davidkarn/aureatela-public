Now an account must be taken of the cross itself, and its meaning must be related. What the Most High Father arranged from the beginning, and how He ordained all things which were accomplished, not only the foretelling by the prophets, which preceded and was proved true[fn-16-P1606_650441:340-nf] in Christ, but also the manner of His suffering itself teaches. For whatever sufferings He underwent were not without meaning;[fn-16-P1607_650643:341-nf] but they had a figurative meaning[fn-16-P1608_650701:342-nf] and great significance, as had also those divine works which He performed, the strength and power of which had some weight indeed for the present, but also declared something for the future. Heavenly influence opened the eyes of the blind, and gave light to those who did not see; and by this deed He signified that it would come to pass that, turning to the nations which were ignorant of God, He might enlighten the breasts of the foolish with the light of wisdom, and open the eyes of their understanding to the contemplation of the truth. For they are truly blind who, not seeing heavenly things, and surrounded with the darkness of ignorance, worship earthly and frail things. He opened the ears of the deaf. It is plain that this divine power did not limit its exercise to this point;[fn-16-P1609_651508:343-nf] but He declared that it would shortly come to pass, that they who were destitute of the truth would both hear and understand the divine words of God. For you may truly call those deaf who do not hear the things which are heavenly and true, and worthy of being performed. He loosed the tongues of the dumb, so that they spake plainly.[fn-16-P1610_651871:344-nf] A power worthy of admiration,[fn-16-P1611_651928:345-nf] even when it was in operation: but there was contained in this display[fn-16-P1612_652218:346-nf] of power another meaning, which showed that it would shortly come to pass that those who were lately ignorant of heavenly things, having received the instruction of wisdom, might speak respecting God and the truth. For he who is ignorant of the divine nature, he truly is speechless and dumb, although he is the most eloquent of all men. For when the tongue has begun to speak truth-that is, to set forth the excellency and majesty of the one God-then only does it discharge the office of its nature; but as long as it speaks false things it is not rightly employed:[fn-16-P1613_652813:347-nf] and therefore he must necessarily be speechless who cannot utter divine things. He also renewed the feet of the lame to the office of walking,-a strength of divine work worthy of praise; but the figure implied this, that the errors of a worldly and wandering life being restrained, the path of truth was opened by which men might walk to attain the favour of God. For He is truly to be considered lame, who, being enwrapped in the gloom and darkness of folly, and ignorant in what direction to go, with feet liable to stumble and fall, walks in the way of death.","title":"Book IV.

Again, no widow of youthful age must quiet her qualms of conscience by the plea that he gives commandment that no widow is to be taken into the number under three-score years old.[fn-45-P4547_1235128:3235-nf] He does not by this arrangement urge unmarried girls or youthful widows to marry, seeing that even of the married he says: \"the time is short: it remaineth that they that have wives be as though they had none.\"[fn-45-P4548_1235361:3236-nf] No, he is speaking of widows who have relations able to support them, who have sons and grandsons to be responsible for their maintenance. The apostle commands these latter to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents and to relieve them adequately; that the church may not be charged, but may be free to relieve those that are widows indeed. \"Honour widows,\" he writes, \"that are widows indeed,\" that is, such as are desolate and have no relations to help them, who cannot labour with their hands, who are weakened by poverty and overcome by years, whose trust is in God and their only work prayer.[fn-45-P4549_1235993:3237-nf] From which it is easy to infer that the younger widows, unless they are excused by ill health, are either left to their own exertions or else are consigned to the care of their children or relations. The word `honour' in this passage implies either alms or a gift, as also in the verse immediately following: \"Let the elders ...be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.\"[fn-45-P4550_1236447:3238-nf] So also in the gospel when the Lord discusses that commandment of the Law which says: \"Honour thy father and thy mother,\"[fn-45-P4551_1236592:3239-nf] He declares that it is to be interpreted not of mere words which while offering an empty shew of regard may still leave a parent's wants unrelieved, but of the actual provision of the necessaries of life. The Lord commanded that poor parents should be supported by their children and that these should pay them back when old those benefits which they had themselves received in their childhood. The scribes and pharisees on the other hand taught the children to answer their parents by saying: \"It is Corban, that is to say, a gift[fn-45-P4552_1237146:3240-nf] which I have promised to the altar and engaged to present to the temple: it will relieve you as much there, as if I were to give it you directly to buy food.\"[fn-45-P4553_1237328:3241-nf] So it frequently happened that while father and mother were destitute their children were offering sacrifices for the priests and scribes to consume. If then the apostle compels poor widows-yet only those who are young and not broken down by sickness-to labour with their hands that the church, not charged with their maintenance, may be able to support such widows as are old, what plea can be urged by one who has abundance of this world's goods, both for her own wants and those of others, and who can make to herself friends of the mammon of unrighteousness able to receive her into everlasting habitations?[fn-45-P4554_1238016:3242-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":7,"verse":26,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_06_book_i_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"Now Constantine, the emperor, having thus embraced Christianity, conducted himself as a Christian of his profession, rebuilding the churches, and enriching them with splendid offerings: he also either closed or destroyed the temples of the pagans,[fn-1-P194_46983:9-nf] and exposed the images which were in them to popular contempt.

[XXVI.] Sanctification is not of merely one measure; for even catechumens, I take it, are sanctified in their own measure by the sign of Christ, and the prayer of imposition of hands; and what they receive is holy, although it is not the body of Christ, - holier than any food which constitutes our ordinary nourishment, because it is a sacrament.[fn-10-P1015_554411:164-nf] However, that very meat and drink, wherewithal the necessities of our present life are sustained, are, according to the same apostle, \"sanctified by the word of God and prayer,\"[fn-10-P1016_555041:165-nf] even the prayer with which we beg that our bodies may be refreshed. Just as therefore this sanctification of our ordinary food does not hinder what enters the mouth from descending into the belly, and being ejected into the draught,[fn-10-P1017_555295:166-nf] ] and partaking of the corruption into which everything earthly is resolved, whence the Lord exhorts us to labour for the other food which never perishes:[fn-10-P1018_555471:167-nf] so the sanctification of the catechumen, if he is not baptized, does not avail for his entrance into the kingdom of heaven, nor for the remission of his sins. And, by parity of reasoning, that sanctification likewise, of whatever measure it be, which, according to the apostle, is in the children of believers, has nothing whatever to do with the question of baptism and of the origin or the remission of sin.[fn-10-P1019_555901:168-nf] The apostle, in this very passage which has occupied our attention, says that the unbeliever of a married couple is sanctified by a believing partner: \"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband. Else were your children unclean, but now are they holy.\"[fn-10-P1020_556283:169-nf] Now, I should say, there is not a man whose mind is so warped by unbelief, as to suppose that, whatever sense he gives to these words, they can possibly mean that a husband who is not a Christian should not be baptized, because his wife is a Christian, and that he has already obtained remission of his sins, with the certain prospect of entering the kingdom of heaven, because he is described as being sanctified by his wife.

For \"if righteousness is by the law, then Christ has died in vain.\"[fn-16-P1671_756613:262-nf] Seeing, however, that if He has not died in vain, He has ascended up on high, and has led captivity captive, and has given gifts to men,[fn-16-P1672_756770:263-nf] it follows that whosoever has, has from this source. But whosoever denies that he has from Him, either has not, or is in great danger of being deprived of what he has.[fn-16-P1673_756973:264-nf] \"For it is one God which justifies the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith;\"[fn-16-P1674_757105:265-nf] in which clauses there is no real difference in the sense, as if the phrase \"by faith\" meant one thing, and \"through faith\" another, but only a variety of expression. For in one passage, when speaking of the Gentiles,-that is, of the uncircumcision,-he says, \"The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen by faith;\"[fn-16-P1675_757458:266-nf] and again, in another, when speaking of the circumcision, to which he himself belonged, he says, \"We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed in Jesus Christ.\"[fn-16-P1676_757767:267-nf] Observe, he says that both the uncircumcision are justified by faith, and the circumcision through faith, if, indeed, the circumcision keep the righteousness of faith. For the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith,[fn-16-P1677_758210:268-nf] -by obtaining it of God, not by assuming it of themselves. But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness. And why? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by works[fn-16-P1678_758465:269-nf] -in other words, working it out as it were by themselves, not believing that it is God who works within them. \"For it is God which worketh in us both to will and to do of His own good pleasure.\"[fn-16-P1679_758684:270-nf] And hereby \"they stumbled at the stumbling-stone.\"[fn-16-P1680_758756:271-nf] For what he said, \"not by faith, but as it were by works,\"[fn-16-P1681_758835:272-nf] he most clearly explained in the following words: \"They, being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.\"[fn-16-P1682_759147:273-nf] Then are we still in doubt what are those works of the law by which a man is not justified, if he believes them to be his own works, as it were, without the help and gift of God, which is \"by the faith of Jesus Christ?\" And do we suppose that they are circumcision and the other like ordinances, because some such things in other passages are read concerning these sacramental rites too? In this place, however, it is certainly not circumcision which they wanted to establish as their own righteousness, because God established this by prescribing it Himself. Nor is it possible for us to understand this statement, of those works concerning which the Lord says to them, \"Ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition;\"[fn-16-P1683_759912:274-nf] because, as the apostle says, Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.\"[fn-16-P1684_760065:275-nf] He did not say, Which followed after their own traditions, framing them and relying on them. This then is the sole distinction, that the very precept, \"Thou shalt not covet,\"[fn-16-P1685_760260:276-nf] and God's other good and holycommandments, they attributed to themselves; whereas, that man may keep them, God must work in him through faith in Jesus Christ, who is \"the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.\"[fn-16-P1686_760513:277-nf] That is to say, every one who is incorporated into Him and made a member of His body, is able, by His giving the increase within, to work righteousness.

Matthew, accordingly, proceeds with his narrative, after the notice of that discourse which the Lord delivered in the presence of the Pharisees on the subject of the unwashed hands. Preserving also the order of the succeeding events, as far as it is indicated by the transitions from the one to the other, he introduces this account into the context in the following manner: \"And Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto Him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, Thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. But He answered her not a word,\" and so on, down to the words, \"O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.\"[fn-19-P1959_812847:414-nf] This story of the woman of Canaan is recorded also by Mark, who keeps the same order of events, and gives no occasion to raise any question as to a want of harmony, unless it be found in the circumstance that he tells us how the Lord was in the house at the time when the said woman came to Him with the petition on behalf of her daughter.[fn-19-P1960_813211:415-nf] Now we might readily suppose that Matthew has simply omitted mention of the house, while nevertheless relating the same occurrence. But inasmuch as he states that the disciples made the suggestion to Him in these terms, \"Send her away, for she crieth after us,\" he seems to imply distinctly that the woman gave utterance to these cries of entreaty behind the Lord as He walked on. In what sense, then, could it have been \"in the house,\" unless we are to take Mark to have intimated the fact, that she had gone into the place where Jesus then was, when he mentioned at the beginning of the narrative that He was in the house? But when Matthew says that \"He answered her not a word,\" he has given us also to understand what neither of the two evangelists has related explicitly,-namely, the fact that during that silence which He maintained Jesus went out of the house. And in this manner all the other particulars arebrought into a connection which from this point onwards presents no kind of appearance of discrepancy. For as to what Mark records with respect to the answer which the Lord gave her, to the effect that it was not meet to take the children's bread and cast it unto the dogs, that, reply was returned only after the interposition of certain sayings which Matthew has not left unrecorded. That is to say, [we are to suppose that] there came in first the request which the disciples addressed to Him in regard to the woman's case, and the answer He gave them, to the effect that He was not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel; that next there was her own approach, or, in other words, her coming after Him, and worshipping Him, saying, \"Lord, help me;\" and that then, after all these incidents, those words were spoken which have been recorded by both the evangelists.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":7,"verse":31,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":52,"source_paragraph":"240","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"104.

We must see, however, whether this sentence must be supposed to stand in opposition to another of the Lord's sayings, namely, the one to this effect, \"He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.\"[fn-27-P2774_1226088:20-nf] For how was this man not against Him, who was notwith Him, and of whom John reported that he did not unite with them in following Him, if he is against Him who is not with Him? Or if the man was against Him, how does He say to the disciples, \"Forbid him not; for he that is not against you is on your side\"? Will any one aver that it is of consequence to observe that here He says to the disciples, \"He that is not against you is on your side;\" whereas, in the other passage, He spoke of Himself in the terms, \"He that is not with me is against me\"? That would make it appear, indeed, as if it were possible for one not to be with Him, although he was associated with those disciples of His who are, so to speak; His very members. Besides, how would the truth of such sayings as these stand then: \"He that receiveth you receiveth me;\"[fn-27-P2775_1226943:21-nf] and \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me\"?[fn-27-P2776_1227064:22-nf] Or is it possible for one not to be against Him, although he may be against His disciples? Nay; for what shall we make then of words like these: \"He that despiseth you, despiseth me;\"[fn-27-P2777_1227268:23-nf] and, \"Inasmuch as ye did it not unto the least of mine, ye did it not unto me;\"[fn-27-P2778_1227365:24-nf] and, \"Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me,\"[fn-27-P2779_1227429:25-nf] -although it was His disciples that Saul was persecuting? But, in good truth, the sense intended to be conveyed is just this, that, so far as a man is not with Him, so far is he against Him; and again, that, so far as a man is not against Him, so far is he with Him. For example, take this very case of the individual who was working miracles in the name of Christ, and yet was not in the company of Christ's disciples: so far as this man was working miracles in His name, so far was he with them, and so far he was not against them.[fn-27-P2780_1227980:26-nf] But, inasmuch as they had prohibited the man from doing a thing in which, so far forth, he was really with them, the Lord said to them,\" Forbid him not.\" For what they ought to have forbidden was what was outside their fellowship, so that they might bring him over to the unity of the Church, and not a thing like this, in which he was at one with them, that is to say, so far as he commended the name of their Master and Lord in the casting out of devils. And this is the principle on which the Catholic Church acts, not condemning common sacraments among heretics; for in these they are with us, and they are not against us. But she condemns and forbids division and separation, or any sentiment adverse to peace and truth. For therein they are against us, just because they are not with us in that, and because, not gathering with us, they are consequently scattering.

Yesterday meanness and avarice were withering your hand; to-day let liberality and kindness stretch it out.[fn-52-P5242_1747692:112-nf] It is a noble cure for a weak hand to disperse abroad, to give to the poor,[fn-52-P5243_1747786:113-nf] to pour out the things which we possess abundantly, till we reach the very bottom; and perhaps this will gush forth food for you, as for the woman of Sarepta,[fn-52-P5244_1747965:114-nf] and especially if you happen to be feeding an Elias, to recognize that it is a good abundance to be needy for the sake of Christ, Who for our sakes became poor. If you were deaf and dumb, let the Word sound[fn-52-P5245_1748199:115-nf] in your ears, or rather keep there Him Who hath sounded. Do not shut your ears to the Instruction of the Lord, and to His Counsel, like the adder to charms.[fn-52-P5246_1748377:116-nf] If you are blind and unenlightened, lighten your eyes that you sleep not in death.[fn-52-P5247_1748484:117-nf] In God's Light see light,[fn-52-P5248_1748530:118-nf] and in the Spirit of God be enlightened by the Son, That Threefold and Undivided Light. If you receive all the Word, you will bring therewith upon your own soul all the healing powers of Christ, with which separately these individuals were healed. Only be not ignorant of the measure of grace; only let not the enemy, while you sleep, maliciously sow tares.[fn-52-P5249_1748909:119-nf] Only take care that as by your cleansing you have become an object of enmity to the Evil One, you do not again make yourself an object of pity by sin.

Only be diligent as to your cleansing, \"setting ascensions in your heart,\"[fn-52-P5250_1749271:120-nf] and keep with all diligence the remission which you have received as a gift, in order that, while the remission comes from God, the preservation of it may come from yourself also.","title":"Oration XL.","author":"Gregory Nazianzen"},{"chapter":7,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_57_homily_li_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"And Mark again makes this plainer, by saying, \"It is Corban, by whatsoever thou mightest be profiled by me;\"[fn-49-P4972_1552350:11-nf] which means, not a gift and present, but properly an offering.","title":"Homily LI.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":7,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_57_homily_li_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"49","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"But Mark saith, that \"cleansing the meats,\"[fn-50-P5018_1564433:28-nf] He spake this.

Augustin answered: Any one that hears these words, without being acquainted with the Scriptures, and who does not believe that you are either so far astray as not to know what you are saying, or deceiving in such wise that he whom you have deceived should not know what he says, would believe that the prophet Jeremiah, wishing to be baptized, had taken precautions not to be baptized by impious men, and had used these words with this intent. For what was your object in saying, previous to your quotation of this passage, \"Imitate indeed the prophets, who feared to have their holy souls deceived with false baptism?\" Just as though, in the days of Jeremiah, any one were washed with the sacrament of baptism, except so far as the Pharisees almost every moment bathed themselves, and their couches and cups and platters, with the washings which the Lord condemned, as we read in the gospel.[fn-54-P5469_2645962:316-nf] How then could Jeremiah have said this, as though he desired to be baptized, and sought to avoid being baptized by impious men? He said it, then, when he was complaining of a faithless people, by the corruption of whose morals he was vexed, not wishing to associate with their deeds; and yet he did not separate himself bodily from their congregation, nor seek other sacraments than those which the people received as suitable to that time, according to the law of Moses. To this people, therefore, in their evil mode of life, he gave the name of \"a wound,\" with which the heart of the righteous man was grievously smitten, whether speaking thus of himself, or fore-shadowing in himself what he foresaw would come to pass. For he speaks as follows: \"O Lord, remember me, and visit me; make clear my innocence before those who persecute me in no spirit of long-suffering: know that for Thy sake I have suffered rebuke from those that scorn Thy words. Make their portion complete; and Thy word shall be unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by Thy name, O Lord God of hosts. I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, but was afraid of the presence of Thy hand; I sat alone, because I was filled with bitterness. Why do those who make me sad prevail against me? My wound is grievous; whence shall I be healed? It is become unto me as lying water, that has no faith.\"[fn-54-P5470_2647369:317-nf] In all this it is manifest what the prophet wished to be understood, but manifest only to those who do not wish to distort to their own perverse cause the meaning of what they read. For Jeremiah says that his wound has become unto him as lying water, which cannot inspire faith; but he wished that by his wound those should be understood who made him sad by the evil conduct of their lives. Whence also the apostle says, \"Without were fightings, within were fears;\"[fn-54-P5471_2647867:318-nf] and again, \"Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?\"[fn-54-P5472_2647967:319-nf] And because he had no hopes that they could be reformed, therefore he said, \"Whence shall I be healed?\" as though his own pain must needs continue so long as those among whom he was compelled to live continued what they were. But that a people is commonly understood under the appellation of water is shown in the Apocalypse, where we understand \"many waters\" to mean \"many peoples,\" not by any conjecture of our own, but by an express explanation in the place itself.[fn-54-P5473_2648458:320-nf] Abstain then from blaspheming the sacrament of baptism from any misunderstanding, or rather error, even when found in a man of most abandoned character; for not even in the lying Simon was the baptism which he received a lying water,[fn-54-P5474_2648714:321-nf] nor do all the liars of your party administer a lying water when they baptize in the name of the Trinity. For neither do they begin to be liars only when they are betrayed and convicted, and so forced to acknowledge their misdeeds; but rather they were already liars, when, being adulterers and accursed, they pretended to be chaste and innocent.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":7,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_64_epistle_xxxix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"ANF-05","text":"6. The Lord warns us in His Gospel, saying, \"Ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may establish your own tradition.\"[fn-54-P5401_1648242:12-nf] Let them who reject the commandment of God and endeavour to keep their own tradition be bravely and firmly rejected by you; let one downfall be sufficient for the lapsed; let no one by his fraud hurl down those who wish to rise; let no one cast down more deeply and depress those who are down, on whose behalf we pray that they may be raised up by God's hand and arm; let no one turn away from all hope of safety those who are half alive and entreating that they may receive their former health; let no one extinguish every light of the way of salvation to those that are wavering in the darkness of their lapse.

Join also your petitions and prayers with our prayers and petitions; mingle your tears with our wailings. Avoid the wolves who separate the sheep from the shepherd; avoid the envenomed tongue of the devil, who from the beginning of the world, always deceitful and lying, lies that he may deceive, cajoles that he may injure, promises good that he may give evil, promises life that he may put to death. Now also his words are evident, and his poisons are plain.

There is then no reason, dearest brother, for any one to think that the custom of certain persons is to be followed, who have thought in thee past that water alone should be offered in the cup of the Lord. For we must inquire whom they themselves have followed. For if in the sacrifice which Christ offered none is to be followed but Christ, assuredly it behoves us to obey and do that which Christ did, and what He commanded to be done, since He Himself says in the Gospel, \"If ye do whatsoever I command you, henceforth I call you not servants, but friends.\"[fn-59-P5994_1889623:28-nf] And that Christ alone ought to be heard, the Father also testifies from heaven, saying, \"This is my well-beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye Him.\"[fn-59-P5995_1889804:29-nf] Wherefore, if Christ alone must be heard, we ought not to give heed to what another before us may have I thought was to be done, but what Christ, who is before all, first did. Neither is it becoming to follow the practice of man, but the truth of God; since God speaks by Isaiah the prophet, and says, \"In vain do they worship me, teaching the commandments and doctrines of men.\"[fn-59-P5996_1890204:30-nf] And again the Lord in the Gospel repeals this same saying, and says, \"Ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.\"[fn-59-P5997_1890366:31-nf] Moreover, in another place He establishes it, saying, \"Whosoever shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven.\"[fn-59-P5998_1890575:32-nf] But if we may not break even the least of the Lord's commandments, how much rather is it forbidden to infringe such important ones, so great, so pertaining to the very sacrament of our Lord's passion and our own redemption, or to change it by human tradition into anything else than what was divinely appointed! For if Jesus Christ, our Lord and God, is Himself the chief priest of God the Father, and has first offered Himself a sacrifice to the Father, and has commanded this to be done in commemoration of Himself, certainly that priest truly discharges the office of Christ, who imitates that which Christ did; and he then offers a true and full sacrifice in the Church to God the Father, when he proceeds to offer it according to what he sees Christ Himself to have offered.","title":"Epistle LXII.","author":"Cyprian"},{"chapter":7,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_92_epistle_lxvii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"ANF-05","text":"2.

For we ought not to be forgetful what the Lord spoke to the Jews by Isaiah the prophet, rebuking, and indignant that they had despised the divine precepts and followed human doctrines. \"This people,\" he says, honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is widely removed from me; but in vain do they worship me, teaching the doctrines and commandments of men.\"[fn-61-P6119_1931518:8-nf] This also the Lord repeats in the Gospel, and says, \"Ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may establish your own tradition.\"[fn-61-P6120_1931666:9-nf] Having which things before our eyes, and solicitously and religiously considering them, we ought in the ordinations of priests to choose none but unstained and upright ministers,[fn-61-P6121_1931863:10-nf] who, holily and worthily offering sacrifices to God, may be heard in the prayers which they make for the safety of the Lord's people, since it is written, \"God heareth not a sinner; but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth His will, him He heareth.\"[fn-61-P6122_1932140:11-nf] On which account it is fitting, that with full diligence and sincere investigation those should be chosen for God's priesthood whom it is manifest God will hear.","title":"Epistle LXVII.","author":"Cyprian"},{"chapter":7,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_98_epistle_lxxiii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"ANF-05","text":"3.
