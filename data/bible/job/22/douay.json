{"verses":["Then Eliphaz the Themanite answered, and said:","Can man be compared with God, even though he were of perfect\nknowledge?","What doth it profit God if thou be just?  or what dost thou give\nhim if thy way be unspotted?","Shall he reprove thee for fear, and come with thee into judgment:","And not for thy manifold wickedness and thy infinite iniquities?","For thou hast taken away the pledge of thy brethren without\ncause, and stripped the naked of their clothing.","Thou hast not given water to the weary, thou hast withdrawn bread\nfrom the hungry.","In the strength of thy arm thou didst possess the land, and being\nthe most mighty thou holdest it.","Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless\nthou hast broken in pieces.","Therefore art thou surrounded with shares, and sudden fear\ntroubleth thee.","And didst thou think that thou shouldst not see darkness, and\nthat thou shouldst not be covered with the violence of overflowing\nwaters?","Dost not thou think that God is higher than heaven, and is\nelevated above the height of the stars?","And thou sayst:  What doth God know?  and he judgeth as it were\nthrough a mist.","The clouds are his covert, and he doth not consider our things,\nand he walketh about the poles of heaven.","Dost thou desire to keep the path of ages, which wicked men have\ntrodden?","Who were taken away before their time, and a flood hath\noverthrown their foundation.","Who said to God:  Depart from us:  and looked upon the Almighty as\nif he could do nothing:","Whereas he had filled their houses with good things:  whose way\nof thinking be far from me.","The just shall see, and shall rejoice, and the innocent shall\nlaugh them to scorn.","Is not their exaltation cut down, and hath not fire devoured the\nremnants of them?","Submit thyself then to him, and be at peace:  and thereby thou\nshalt have the best fruits.","Receive the law of his mouth, and lay up his words in thy heart.","If thou wilt return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, and\nshalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacle.","He shall give for earth flint, and for flint torrents of gold.","And the Almighty shall be against thy enemies, and silver shall\nbe heaped together for thee.","Then shalt thou abound in delights in the Almighty, and shalt\nlift up thy face to God.","Thou shalt pray to him, and he will hear thee, and thou shalt\npay vows.","Thou shalt decree a thing, and it shall come to thee, and light\nshall shine in thy ways.","For he that hath been humbled, shall be in glory:  and he that\nshall bow down his eyes, he shall be saved.","The innocent shall be saved, and he shall be saved by the\ncleanness of his hands."]}
