{"verses":["Then Eliphaz, the Themanite, answered, and said:","If we begin to speak to thee, perhaps thou wilt take it ill; but\nwho can withhold the words he hath conceived?","Behold thou hast taught many, and thou hast strengthened the weary\nhands:","Thy words have confirmed them that were staggering, and thou hast\nstrengthened the trembling knees:","But now the scourge is come upon thee, and thou faintest:  It hath\ntouched thee, and thou art troubled.","Where is thy fear, thy fortitude, thy patience, and the perfection\nof thy ways?","Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished being innocent?  or when\nwere the just destroyed?","On the contrary, I have seen those who work iniquity, and sow\nsorrows, and reap them,","Perishing by the blast of God, and consumed by the spirit of his\nwrath.","The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the lioness, and the\nteeth of the whelps of lions, are broken:","The tiger hath perished for want of prey, and the young lions are\nscattered abroad.","Now there was a word spoken to me in private, and my ears by\nstealth, as it were, received the veins of its whisper.","In the horror of a vision by night, when deep sleep is wont to\nhold men,","Fear seized upon me, and trembling, and all my bones were\naffrighted:","And when a spirit passed before me, the hair of my flesh stood\nup.","There stood one whose countenance I knew not, an image before my\neyes, and I heard the voice, as it were, of a gentle wind.","Shall man be justified in comparison of God, or shall a man be\nmore pure than his maker?","Behold, they that serve him are not steadfast, and in his angels\nhe found wickedness:","How much more shall they that dwell in houses of clay, who have\nan earthly foundation, be consumed as with the moth?","From morning till evening they shall be cut down:  and because no\none understandeth, they shall perish for ever.","And they that shall be left, shall be taken away from them:  they\nshall die, and not in wisdom."]}
