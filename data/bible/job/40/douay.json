{"verses":["And the Lord answering Job out of the whirlwind, said:","Gird up thy loins like a man:  I will ask thee, and do thou tell\nme.","Wilt thou make void my judgment:  and condemn me, that thou mayst\nbe justified?","And hast thou an arm like God, and canst thou thunder with a\nvoice like him?","Clothe thyself with beauty, and set thyself up on high, and be\nglorious, and put on goodly garments.","Scatter the proud in thy indignation, and behold every arrogant\nman, and humble him.","Look on all that are proud, and confound them, and crush the\nwicked in their place,","Hide them in the dust together, and plunge their faces into the\npit.","Then I will confess that thy right hand is able to save thee.","Behold behemoth whom I made with thee, he eateth grass like an\nox.","His strength is in his loins, and his force in the navel of his\nbelly.","He setteth up his tail like a cedar, the sinews of his testicles\nare wrapped together.","His bones are like pipes of brass, his gristle like plates of\niron.","He is the beginning of the ways of God, who made him, he will\napply his sword.","To him the mountains bring forth grass:  there all the beasts of\nthe field shall play.","He sleepeth under the shadow, in the covert of the reed, and in\nmoist places.","The shades cover his shadow, the willows of the brook shall\ncompass him about.","Behold, he will drink up a river, and not wonder:  and he\ntrusteth that the Jordan may run into his mouth.","In his eyes as with a hook he shall take him, and bore through\nhis nostrils with stakes.","Canst thou draw out the leviathan with a hook, or canst thou tie\nhis tongue with a cord?","Canst thou put a ring in his nose, or bore through his jaw with\na buckle?","Will he make many supplications to thee, or speak soft words to\nthee?","Will he make a covenant with thee, and wilt thou take him to be\na servant for ever,","Shalt thou play with him as with a bird, or tie him up for thy\nhandmaids?","Shall friends cut him in pieces, shall merchants divide him?","Wilt thou fill nets with his skin, and the cabins of fishes with\nhis head?","Lay thy hand upon him:  remember the battle, and speak no more.","Behold his hope shall fail him, and in the sight of all he shall\nbe cast down."]}
