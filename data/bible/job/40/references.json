This, says he, is what is spoken: \"We have heard his voice, no doubt, but we have not seen his shape.\"[fn-10-P1047_275743:80-nf] For the voice of him that is set apart[fn-10-P1048_275799:81-nf] and portrayed is heard; but (his) shape, which descends from above from the unportrayed one,-what sort it is, nobody knows. It resides, however, in an earthly mould, yet no one recognises it. This, he says, is \"the god that inhabiteth the flood,\" according to the Psalter, \"and who speaketh and crieth from many waters.\"[fn-10-P1049_276181:82-nf] The \"many waters,\" he says, are the diversified generation of mortal men, from which (generation) he cries and vociferates to the unportrayed man, saying, \"Preserve my only-begotten from the lions.\"[fn-10-P1050_276418:83-nf] In reply to him, it has, says he, been declared, \"Israel, thou art my child: fear not; even though thou passest through rivers, they shall not drown thee; even though thou passest through fire, it shall not scorch thee.\"[fn-10-P1051_276675:84-nf] By rivers he means, says he, the moist substance of generation, and by fire the impulsive principle and desire for generation. \"Thou art mine; fear not.\" And again, he says, \"If a mother forget her children, so as not to have pity on them and give them food, I also will forget you.\"[fn-10-P1052_276980:85-nf] Adam, he says, speaks to his own men: \"But even though a woman forget these things, yet I will not forget you.

All the saints have had illwishers, and even Paradise was not free from the serpent through whose malice death came into the world.[fn-40-P4035_1086835:2892-nf] So the Lord stirred up against Paula Hadad the Edomite[fn-40-P4036_1086914:2893-nf] to buffet her that she might not be exalted, and warned her frequently by the thorn in her flesh[fn-40-P4037_1087057:2894-nf] not to be elated by the greatness of her own virtues or to fancy that, compared with other women, she had attained the summit of perfection. For my part I used to say that it was best to give in to rancour and to retire before passion. So Jacob dealt with his brother Esau; so David met the unrelenting persecution of Saul. I reminded her how the first of these fled into Mesopotamia;[fn-40-P4038_1087467:2895-nf] and how the second surrendered himself to the Philistines,[fn-40-P4039_1087548:2896-nf] and chose to submit to foreign foes rather than to enemies at home. She however replied as follows:- 'Your suggestion would be a wise one if the devil did not everywhere fight against God's servants and handmaidens, and did he not always precede the fugitives to their chosen refuges. Moreover, I am deterred from accepting it by my love for the holy places; and I cannot find another Bethlehem elsewhere. Why may I not by my patience conquer this ill will? Why may I not by my humility break down this pride, and when I am smitten on the one cheek offer to the smiter the other?[fn-40-P4040_1088151:2897-nf] Surely the apostle Paul says \"Overcome evil with good.\"[fn-40-P4041_1088242:2898-nf] Did not the apostles glory when they suffered reproach for the Lord's sake? Did not even the Saviour humble Himself, taking the form of a servant and being made obedient to the Father unto death, even the death of the cross,[fn-40-P4042_1088492:2899-nf] that He might save us by His passion? If Job had not fought the battle and won the victory, he would never have received the crown of righteousness, or have heard the Lord say: \"Thinkest thou that I have spoken unto thee for aught else than this, that thou mightest appear righteous.\"[fn-40-P4043_1088799:2900-nf] In the gospel those only are said to be blessed who suffer persecution for righteousness' sake.[fn-40-P4044_1088962:2901-nf] My conscience is at rest, and I know that it is not from any fault of mine that I am suffering; moreover affliction in this world is a ground for expecting a reward hereafter.' When the enemy was more than usually forward and ventured to reproach her to her face, she used to chant the words of the psalter: \"While the wicked was before me, I was dumb with silence; I held my peace even from good:\"[fn-40-P4045_1089387:2902-nf] and again, \"I as a deaf man heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth:\"[fn-40-P4046_1089505:2903-nf] and \"I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.\"[fn-40-P4047_1089604:2904-nf] When she felt herself tempted, she dwelt upon the words in Deuteronomy: \"The Lord your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul.\"[fn-40-P4048_1089828:2905-nf] In tribulations and afflictions she turned to the splendid language of Isaiah: \"Ye that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts, look for tribulation upon tribulation, for hope also upon hope: yet a little while must these things be by reason of the malice of the lips and by reason of a spiteful tongue.\" This passage of scripture she explained for her own consolation as meaning that the weaned, that is, those who have come to full age, must endure tribulation upon tribulation that they may be accounted worthy to receive hope upon hope. She recalled to mind also the words of the apostle, \"we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope: and hope maketh not ashamed\"[fn-40-P4049_1090606:2906-nf] and \"though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day\":[fn-40-P4050_1090709:2907-nf] and \"our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh in us[fn-40-P4051_1090790:2908-nf] an eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal.[fn-40-P4052_1091033:2909-nf] She used to say that, although to human impatience the time might seem slow in coming, yet that it would not be long but that presently help would come from God who says: \"In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee.\"[fn-40-P4053_1091316:2910-nf] We ought not, she declared, to dread the deceitful lips and tongues of the wicked, for we rejoice in the aid of the Lord who warns us by His prophet: \"fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings; for the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool\":[fn-40-P4054_1091661:2911-nf] and she quoted His own words, \"In your patience ye shall win your souls\":[fn-40-P4055_1091763:2912-nf] as well as those of the apostle, \"the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed? us\":[fn-40-P4056_1091932:2913-nf] and in another place, \"we are to suffer affliction\"[fn-40-P4057_1092012:2914-nf] that we may be patient in all things that befall us, for \"he that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.\"[fn-40-P4058_1092194:2915-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":40,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1425","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"10.

These are \"the fiery darts\"[fn-51-P5190_1427885:3711-nf] with which the devil wounds men and sets them on fire, and it was these which the king of Babylon used against the three children.

I delayed for a little while the production of proofs from the Old Testament, because, wherever the Old Testament is against them they are accustomed to cry out that[fn-66-P6641_2081802:50-nf] the Law and the Prophets were until John. But who does not know that under the other dispensation of God all the saints of past times were of equal merit with Christians at the present day? As Abraham in days gone by pleased God in wedlock, so virgins now please him in perpetual virginity. He served the Law and his own times; let us now serve the Gospel and our times,[fn-66-P6642_2082192:51-nf] upon whom the ends of the ages have come. David the chosen one, the man after God's own heart, who had performed all His pleasure, and who in a certain psalm had said,[fn-66-P6643_2082379:52-nf] \"Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the Lord and shall not slide.

Solomon, beloved of the Lord, and to whom God had twice revealed Himself, because he loved women forsook the love of God. It is related in the[fn-66-P6645_2082943:54-nf] Book of Days that Manasses the wicked king was restored after the Babylonish captivity to his former rank. And Josiah, a holy man,[fn-66-P6646_2083122:55-nf] was slain by the king of Egypt on the plain of Megiddo.[fn-66-P6647_2083227:56-nf] Joshua also, the son of Josedech and high-priest, although he was a type of our Saviour Who bore our sins, and united to Himself a church of alien birth from among the Gentiles, is nevertheless, according to the letter of Scripture,represented in filthy garments after he attained to the priesthood, and with the devil standing at his right hand; and white raiment is afterwards restored to him. It is needless to tell how Moses and Aaron[fn-66-P6648_2083688:57-nf] offended God at the water of strife, and did not enter the land of promise. For the blessed Job relates that even the angels and every creature can sin.[fn-66-P6649_2083873:58-nf] \"Shall mortal man,\" he says, \"be just beforeGod? Shall a man be spotless in his works?

It is needless to tell how Moses and Aaron[fn-66-P6648_2083688:57-nf] offended God at the water of strife, and did not enter the land of promise.

Therefore, my beloved, when the Holy Spirit departs from a man who has received it,\nuntil it returns and comes to him, then Satan draws near unto that man, to cause him to sin, and that\nthe Holy Spirit may leave him altogether. For as long as the Spirit is with a man, Satan fears to\ncome near him. And observe, my beloved, that our Lord also, Who was born from the Spirit, was not\ntempted by Satan until in baptism He received the Spirit from on high. And then the Spirit led him\nforth to be tempted by Satan. This, then, is the way with man; that in the hour in which he perceives\nin himself that he is not fervent in the Spirit, and that his heart is inclining to the thought of\nthis world, he may know that the Spirit is not with him, and may arise and pray and keep vigil that\nthe Spirit of God may come to him, that he be not overcome by the adversary. A thief does not dig\ninto a house, until he sees that its master is departing from it. Thus also Satan cannot draw near to\nthat house which is our body, until the Spirit of Christ departs from it. And be sure, my beloved,\nthat the thief does not certainly know whether the master of the house is within or not, but first\nhe applies his ear, and looks. If he hears the voice of the master of the house within it\nsaying:-\"I have a journey to go,\" and when he has searched out and seen that the master of the house\nhas set out to perform his business, then the thief comes and digs into the house and steals. But if\nhe hears the voice of the master of the house admonishing and commanding his household to watch and\nguard his house, and saying to them, \"I also am within the house,\" then the thief will fear and flee,\nthat he may not be taken and captured. Thus also Satan, he has not the knowledge beforehand to know\nor see when the Spirit will depart, that so he may come to rob the man; but he too listens and\nwatches, and so assails. But if he hears a man in whom Christ dwells speaking shameful words, or\nenraged, or quarrelling, or contending, then Satan knows that Christ is not with him, and he comes\nand accomplishes his will in him. For Christ dwells in the peaceful and the meek, and lodges in those\nthat fear His word, as He says through the prophet:-On whom shall I look, and in whom shall I\ndwell, but in the peaceful and the meek who fear My word?[fn-42-P4299_1430629:118-nf] And our Lord said:-Whoever walks in My\ncommandments and keeps My love, We will come to him and make Our abode him.[fn-43-P4300_1430764:119-nf] But if he hears from a man that he is on his\nguard and is praying anti meditating in the Law of his Lord by day and by night, then he turns back\nfrom him, for he knows that Christ is with him. And if thou shouldest say, \"How manifold is Satan!\nfor lo! he fights with many;\" then hear and learn from that which I proved to thee above concerning\nChrist, that no matter to what extent He is divided amongst many, yet He is not a whit diminished.\nFor, as the house, through the window of which a little sunlight enters, is altogether illumined, so\nthe man into whom a little of Satan enters, is altogether darkened. Hear that which the Apostle\nsaid:-If Satan is transfigured to an angel of light, it is no wonder if his ministers also are\ntransfigured to ministers of righteousness.[fn-43-P4301_1431564:120-nf] And again our Lord said to His disciples:-Lo,\nI have given you authority to tread upon the power of the adversary.[fn-43-P4302_1431705:121-nf] And the Scriptures have made known that he has\npower and also ministers.

For the serpent[fn-105-P10533_2804237:212-nf] -from whom the Ophioneus spoken of by Pherecydes is derived-having become the cause of man's expulsion from the divine Paradise, obscurely shadows forth something similar, having deceived the woman[fn-105-P10534_2804456:213-nf] by a promise of divinity and of greater blessings; and her example is said to have been followed also by the man. And, further, who else could the destroying angel mentioned in the Exodus of Moses[fn-105-P10535_2804683:214-nf] be, than he who was the author of destruction to them that obeyed him, and did not withstand his wicked deeds, nor struggle against them?

For \"every man is tempted of his own lust. Then lust when it has conceived beareth sin, and sin when it is consummated begets death.\"[fn-41-P4104_1511974:3-nf] For the first Adam could not have fallen a victim to gluttony unless he had had material food at hand, and had used it wrongly, nor could the second Adam be tempted without the enticement of some object, when it was said to Him: \"If Thou art the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.\"[fn-41-P4105_1512297:4-nf] And it is clear to everybody that fornication also is only completedby a bodily act, as God says of this spirit to the blessed Job: \"And his force is in his loins, and his strength in the navel of his belly.\"[fn-41-P4106_1512525:5-nf] And so these two faults in particular, which are carried into effect by the aid of the flesh, especially require bodily abstinence as well as spiritual care of the soul; since the determination of the mind is not in itself enough to resist their attacks (as is sometimes the case with anger or gloominess or the other passions, which an effort of the mind alone can overcome without any mortification of the flesh); but bodily chastisement must be used as well, and be carried out by means of fasting and vigils and acts of contrition; and to this must be added change of scene, because since these sins are the results of faults of both mind and body, so they can only be overcome by the united efforts of both. And although the blessed Apostle says generallythat all faults are carnal, since he enumerates enmities and anger and heresies among other works of the flesh,[fn-41-P4107_1513412:6-nf] yet in order to cure them and to discover their nature more exactly we make a twofold division of them: for we call some of them carnal, and some spiritual. And those we call carnal, which specially have to do with pampering the appetites of the flesh, and with which it is so charmed and satisfied, that sometimes it excites the mind when at rest and even drags it against its will to consent to its desire. Of which the blessed Apostle says: \"In which also we all walked in time past in the desires of our flesh, fulfilling the will of the flesh and of our thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath even as the rest.\"[fn-41-P4108_1514056:7-nf] But we call those spiritual which spring only from the impulse of the mind andnot merely contribute no pleasure to the flesh, but actually bring on it a weakness that is harmful to it, and only feed a diseased mind with the food of a most miserable pleasure. And therefore these need a single medicine for the heart: but those which are carnal can only be cured, as we said, by a double remedy. Whence it is extremely useful for those who aspire to purity, to begin by withdrawing from themselves the material which feeds these carnal passions, through which opportunity for or recollection of these same desires can arise in a soul that is still affected by the evil. For a complicated disease needs a complicated remedy. For from the body the object and material which would allure it must be withdrawn, for fear lest the lust should endeavour to break out into act; and before the mind we should no less carefully place diligent meditation on Scripture and watchful anxiety and the withdrawal into solitude, lest it should give birth to desire even in thought. But as regards other faults intercourse with our fellows is no obstacle, or rather it is of the greatest possible use, to those who truly desire to get rid of them, because in mixing with others they more often meet with rebuke, and while they are more frequently provoked the existence of the faults is made evident, and so they are cured with speedy remedies.","title":"V.

Often for their probation, sometimes for their improvement, and in some cases because their sins deserve it. For their probation indeed, as we read that the blessed Abraham and Job and many of the saints endured countless tribulations; or this which is said to the people in Deuteronomy by Moses: \"And thou shalt remember all the way through which the Lord thy God hath brought thee for forty years through the desert, to afflict thee and to prove thee, and that the things that were in thy heart might be made known, whether thou wouldst keep His Commandments or no:\"[fn-43-P4327_1597865:37-nf] and this which we find in the Psalms: \"I proved thee at the waters of strife.\"[fn-43-P4328_1597964:38-nf] To Job also: \"Thinkest thou that I have spoken for any other cause than that thou mightest be seen to be righteous?\"[fn-43-P4329_1598108:39-nf] But for improvement, when God chastens his righteous ones for some small and venial sins, or to raise them to a higher state of purity, and delivers them over to various trials, that He may purge away all their unclean thoughts, and, to use the prophet's word, the \"dross,\" which he sees to have collected in their secret parts, and may thus transmit them like pure gold, to the judgment to come, as He allows nothing to remain in them for the fire of judgment to discover when hereafter it searches them with penal torments according to this saying: \"Many are the tribulations of the righteous.\"[fn-43-P4330_1598728:40-nf] And: \"My son, neglect not the discipline of the Lord, neither be thou wearied whilst thou art rebuked by Him. For whom the Lord loveth He chastiseth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth. For what son is there whom the father doth not correct? But if ye are without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.\"[fn-43-P4331_1599108:41-nf] And in the Apocalypse: \"Those whom I love, I reprove and chasten.\"[fn-43-P4332_1599195:42-nf] To whom under the figure of Jerusalem the following words are spoken by Jeremiah, in the person of God: \"For I will utterly consume all the nations among which I scattered thee: but I will not utterly consume thee: but I will chastise thee in judgment, that thou mayest not seem to thyself innocent.\"[fn-43-P4333_1599515:43-nf] And for this life-giving cleansing David prays when he says: \"Prove me, O Lord, and try me; turn my reins and my heart.\"[fn-43-P4334_1599655:44-nf] Isaiah also, well knowing the value of this trial, says \"O Lord, correct us but with judgment: not in Thine anger.\"[fn-43-P4335_1599796:45-nf] And again: \"I will give thanks to thee, O Lord, for thou wast angry with me: Thy wrath is turned away, and Thou hast comforted me.\"[fn-43-P4336_1599985:46-nf] But as a punishment for sins, the blows of trial are inflicted, as where the Lord threatens that He will send plagues upon the people of Israel: \"I will send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the fury of creatures that trail upon the ground:\"[fn-43-P4337_1600247:47-nf] and \"In vain have I struck your children: they have not received correction.\"[fn-43-P4338_1600347:48-nf] In the Psalms also: \"Many are the scourges of the sinners:\"[fn-43-P4339_1600425:49-nf] and in the gospel: \"Behold thou art made whole: now sin no more, lest a worse thing happen unto thee.\"[fn-43-P4340_1600556:50-nf] We find, it is true, a fourth way also in which we know on the authority of Scripture that some sufferings are brought upon us simply for the manifestation of the glory of God and His works, according to these words of the gospel: \"Neither did this man sin nor his parents, but that the works of God might be manifested in him:\"[fn-43-P4341_1600905:51-nf] and again: \"This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God that the Son of God may be glorified by it.\"[fn-43-P4342_1601040:52-nf] There are also other sorts of vengeance, with which some who have overpassed the bounds of wickedness are smitten in this life, as we read that Dathan and Abiram or Korah were punished, or above all, those of whom the Apostle speaks: \"Wherefore God gave them up to vile passions and a reprobate mind:\"[fn-43-P4343_1601362:53-nf] and this must be counted worse than all other punishments. For of these the Psalmist says: \"They are not in the labours of men; neither shall they be scourged like other men.\"[fn-43-P4344_1601559:54-nf] For theyare not worthy of being healed by the visitation of the Lord which gives life, and by plagues in this world, as \"in despair they have given themselves over to lasciviousness, unto the working of all error unto uncleanness,\"[fn-43-P4345_1601820:55-nf] and as by hardening their hearts, and by growing accustomed and used to sin they have got beyond cleansing in this brief life and punishment in the present world: men, who are thus reproved by the holy word of the prophet: \"I destroyed some of you, as God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet you returned not to Me, saith the Lord,\"[fn-43-P4346_1602225:56-nf] and Jeremiah: \"I have killed and destroyed thy people, and yet they are not returned from their ways.\"[fn-43-P4347_1602346:57-nf] And again: \"Thou hast smitten them and they have not grieved: Thou hast bruised them and they refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than the rock, they have refused to return.\"[fn-43-P4348_1602567:58-nf] And the prophet seeing that all the remedies of this life will have been applied in vain for their healing, and already as it were despairing of their life, declares: \"The bellows have failed in the fire, the founder hath melted in vain: for their wicked deeds are not consumed. Call them reprobate silver, for the Lord hath rejected them.\"[fn-43-P4349_1602924:59-nf] And the Lord thus laments that to no purpose has He applied this salutary cleansing by fire to those who are hardened in their sins, in the person of Jerusalem crusted all over with the rust of her sins, when He says: \"set it empty upon burning coals, that it may be hot, and the brass thereof may be melted; and let the filth of it be melted in the midst thereof. Great pains have been taken, and the great rust thereof is not gone out, no not even by fire. Thy uncleanness is execrable: because I desired to cleanse thee, and thou art not cleansed from thy filthiness.\"[fn-43-P4350_1603518:60-nf] Wherefore like a skilful physician, who has tried all saving cures, and sees there is no remedy left which can be applied to their disease, the Lord is in a manner overcome by their iniquities and is obliged to desist from that kindly chastisement of His, and so denounces them saying: \"I will no longer be angry with thee, and thy jealousy has departed from thee.\"[fn-43-P4351_1603908:61-nf] But of others, whose heart has not grown hard by continuance in sin, and who do not stand in need of that most severe and (if I may so call it) caustic remedy, but for whose salvation the instruction of the life-giving word is suffi- cient-of them it is said: \"I will improve them by hearing of their suffering.\"[fn-43-P4352_1604242:62-nf] We are well aware that there are other reasons also of the punishment and vengeance whichis inflicted on those who have sinned grievously-not to expiate their crimes, nor wipeout the deserts of their sins, but that the living may be put in fear and amend their lives. And these we plainly see were inflicted on Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and Baasha the son of Ahiah, and Ahab and Jezebel, when the Divine reproof thus declares: \"Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will cut down thy posterity, and will kill of Ahab every male, and him that is shut up and the last in Israel. And I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahiah: for that which thou hast done to provoke Me to anger, and for making Israel to sin. The dogs also shall eat Jezebel in the field of Jezreel. If Ahab die in the city, the dogs shall eat him: but if he die in the field the birds of the air shall eat him,\"[fn-43-P4353_1605220:63-nf] and this which is threatened as the greatest threat of all: \"Thy dead body shall not be brought to the sepulchre of thy fathers.\"[fn-43-P4354_1605375:64-nf] It was not that this short and momentary punishment would suffice to purge away the blasphemous inventions of him who first made the golden calves and led to the lasting sin of the people, and their wicked separation from the Lord,-or the countless and disgraceful profanities of those others, but it was that by their example the fear of those punishments which they dreaded might fall on others also, who, as they thought little of the future or even disbelieved in it altogether, would only be moved by consideration of things present; and that owing to this proof of His severity they might acknowledge that there is no lack of care for the affairs of men, and for their daily doings, in the majesty of God on high, and so through that which they greatly feared might the more clearly See in God the rewarder of all their deeds. We find, it is true, that even for lighter faults some men have received the same sentence of death in this world, as that with which those men were punished who, as we said before, were the authors of a blasphemous falling away: as happened in the case of the man who gathered sticks on the Sabbath,[fn-43-P4355_1606532:65-nf] and in that of Ananias and Sapphira, who through the sin of unbelief kept back some portion of their goods: not that the guilt of their sins was equal, but because they were the firstfound out in a new kind of transgression, and so it was right that as they had given to others an example of sin, so also they should give them an example of punishment and of fear, that anyone, who should attempt to copy them, might know that (even if his punishment were postponed in this life) he would be punished in the same way that they were at the trial of the judgment hereafter. And, since in our desire to run through the different kinds of trials and punishments we seem to have wandered somewhat from our subject, on which we were saying that the perfect man will always remain steadfast in either kind of trial, now let us return to it once more.","title":"VI.

But the devil, who hates and envies what is good, could not endure to see such a resolution in a youth, but endeavoured to carry out against him what he had been wont to effect against others. First of all he tried to lead him away from the discipline, whispering to him the remembrance of his wealth, care for his sister, claims of kindred, love of money, love of glory, the various pleasures of the table and the other relaxations of life, and at last the difficulty of virtue and the labour of it; he suggested also the infirmity of the body and the length of the time.

When of old he deceived the first man Adam, thinking that through him he should have all men subject unto him, he exulted with great boldness and said, `My hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people; and as one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all the earth; and there is none that shall escape me or speak against me[fn-39-P3921_1651019:6-nf] .' But when the Lord came upon earth, and the enemy made trial of His human Economy, being unable to deceive the flesh which He had taken upon Him, from that time forth he, who promised himself the occupation of the whole world, is for His sake mocked even by children: that proud one is mocked as a sparrow[fn-39-P3922_1651366:7-nf] . For now the infant child lays his hand upon the hole of the asp, and laughs at him that deceived Eve[fn-39-P3923_1651506:8-nf] ; and all that rightly believe in the Lord tread under foot him that said, `I will ascend above the heights of the clouds: I will be like the Most High[fn-39-P3924_1651687:9-nf] .' Thus he suffers and is dishonoured; and although he still ventures with shameless confidence to disguise himself, yet now, wretched spirit, he is detected the rather by them that bear the Sign on their foreheads[fn-39-P3925_1651919:10-nf] ; yea, more, he is rejected of them, and is humbled, and put to shame. For even if, now that he is a creeping serpent, he shall transform himself into an angel of light, yet his deception will not profit him; for we have been taught that `though an angel from heaven preach unto us any other gospel than that we have received, he is anathema[fn-39-P3926_1652284:11-nf] .'","title":"To the Bishops of Egypt","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":40,"verse":19,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_164_melito_the_philosopher_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"132","folder":"ANF-08","text":"The way of the Lord-the operation of the Deity.
