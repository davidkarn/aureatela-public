I wish to check a mother's weeping, and I groan myself. I make no secret of my feelings; this entire letter is written in tears. Even Jesus wept for Lazarus because He loved him.[fn-11-P1194_254514:793-nf] But he is a poor comforter who is overcome by his own sighs, and from whose afflicted heart tears are wrung as well as words. Dear Paula, my agony is as great as yours. Jesus knows it, whom Blaesilla now follows; the holy angels know it, whose company she now enjoys. I was her father in the spirit, her foster-father in affection. Sometimes I say: \"Let the day perish wherein I was born,\"[fn-11-P1195_254937:794-nf] and again, \"Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth.\"[fn-11-P1196_255093:795-nf] I cry: \"Righteous art thou, O Lord ...yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments. Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper?\"[fn-11-P1197_255240:796-nf] and \"as for me, my feet were almost gone, my steps had well-nigh slipped.

How comes it, I ask, that godless men live to old age in the enjoyment of this world's riches? How comes it that untutored youth and innocent childhood are cut down while still in the bud? Why is it that children three years old or two, and even unweaned infants, are possessed with devils, covered with leprosy, and eaten up with jaundice, while godless men and profane, adulterers and murderers, have health and strength to blaspheme God? Are we not told that the unrighteousness of the father does not fall upon the son,[fn-12-P1200_256337:799-nf] and that \"the soul that sinneth it shall die?\"[fn-12-P1201_256408:800-nf] Or if the old doctrine holds good that the sins of the fathers must be visited upon the children,[fn-12-P1202_256529:801-nf] an old man's countless sins cannot fairly be avenged upon a harmless infant. And I have said: \"Verily, I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency. For all the day long have I been plagued.\"[fn-12-P1203_256761:802-nf] Yet when I have thought of these things, like the prophet I have learned to say: \"When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me; until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.\"[fn-12-P1204_257008:803-nf] Truly the judgments of the Lord are a great deep.[fn-12-P1205_257097:804-nf] \"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!

My detractors must therefore learn either to receive altogether what they have in part admitted, or they must erase my translation and at the same time their own asterisks. For they must allow that those translators who it is clear have left out numerous details, have erred in some points; especially in the book of Job, where, if you withdraw such passages as have been added and marked with asterisks, the greater part of the book will be cut away. This, at all events, will be so in Greek. On the other hand, previous to the publication of our recent translation with asterisks and obeli, about seven or eight hundred lines were missing in the Latin, so that the book, mutilated, torn, and disintegrated, exhibits its deformity to those who publicly read it. The present translation follows no ancient translator, but will be found to reproduce now the exact words, now the meaning, now both together of the original Hebrew, Arabic, and occasionally the Syriac. For an indirectness and a slipperiness attaches to the whole book, even in the Hebrew; and, as orators say in Greek, it[fn-80-P8033_2609863:10-nf] is tricked out with figures of speech, and while it says one thing, it does another; just as if you close your hand to hold an eel or a little[fn-80-P8034_2610027:11-nf] muraena, the more you squeeze it, the sooner it escapes. I remember that in order to understand this volume, I paid a not inconsiderable sum for the services of a teacher, a native of Lydda, who was amongst the Hebrews reckoned to be in the front rank; whether I profiled at all by his teaching, I do not know; of this one thing I am sure, that I could translate only that which I previously understood. Well, then, from the beginning of the book to the words of Job, the Hebrew version is in prose. Further, from the words of Job where he says,[fn-80-P8035_2610679:12-nf] \"May the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, a man-child is conceived,\" to the place where before the close of the book it is written[fn-80-P8036_2610861:13-nf] \"Therefore I blame myself and repent in dust and ashes,\" we have hexameter verses running in dactyl and spondee: and owing to the idiom of the language other feet are frequently introduced not containing the same number of syllables, but the same quantities. Sometimes, also, a sweet and musical rhythm is produced by the breaking up of the verses in accordance with the laws of metre, a fact better known to prosodists than to the ordinary reader. But from the aforesaid verse to the end of the book the small remaining section is a prose composition. And if It seem incredible to any one that the Hebrews really have metres, and that, whether we consider the Psalter or the Lamentations of Jeremiah, or almost all the songs of Scripture, they bear a resemblance to our Flaccus, and the Greek Pindar, and Alcaeus, and Sappho, let him read Philo, Josephus, Origen, Eusebius of Caesarea, and with the aid of their testimony he will find that I speak the truth. Wherefore, let my barking critics listen as I tell them that my motive in toiling at this book was not to censure the ancient translation, but that those passages in it which are obscure, or those which have been omitted, or at all events, through the fault of copyists have been corrupted, might have light thrown upon them by our translation; for we have some slight knowledge of Hebrew, and, as regards Latin, my life, almost from the cradle, has been spent in the company of grammarians, rhetoricians, and philosophers. But if, since the version of the Seventy was published, and even now, when the Gospel of Christ is beaming forth, the Jewish Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, judaising heretics, have been welcomed amongst the Greeks -heretics, who, by their deceitful translation, have concealed many mysteries of salvation, and yet, in the Hexapla are found in the Churches and are expounded by churchmen; ought not I, a Christian, born of Christian parents, and who carry the standard of the cross on my brow, and am zealous to recover what is lost, to correct what is corrupt, and to disclose in pure and faithful language the mysteries of the Church, ought not I, let me, ask, much more to escape the reprobation of fastidious or malicious readers? Let those who will keep the old books with their gold and silver letters on purple skins, or, to follow the ordinary phrase, in \"uncial characters,\" loads of writing rather than manuscripts, if only they will leave for me and mine, our poor pages and copies which are less remarkable for beauty than for accuracy. I have toiled to translate both the Greek versions of the Seventy, and the Hebrew which is the basis of my own, into Latin.

But the second passage suggests a better view, namely, that as many beings were framed with a body, the first made of these was the creature called dragon, but called in another passage[fn-62-P6216_969359:72-nf] the great whale (leviathan) which the Lord tamed. We must ask about this; whether, when the saints were living a blessed life apart from matter and from any body, the dragon, falling from the pure life, became fit to be bound in matter and in a body, so that the Lord could say, speaking through storm and clouds, \"This is the beginning of the creation of God, made for His angels to mock at.\" It is possible, however, that the dragon is not positively the beginning of the creation of the Lord, but that there were many creatures made with a body for the angels to mock at, and that the dragon was the first of these, while others could subsist in a body without such reproach. But it is not so. For the soul of the sun is placed in a body, and the whole creation, of which the Apostle says:[fn-62-P6217_970169:73-nf] \"The whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now,\" and perhaps the following is about the same: \"The creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but on account of Him who subjected it for hope; \"so that bodies might be in vanity, and doing the things of the body, as he who is in the body must.[fn-62-P6218_970517:74-nf] ... One who is in the body does the things of the body, though unwillingly. Wherefore the creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but he who does unwillingly the things of the body does what he does for the sake of hope, as if we should say that Paul desired to remain in the flesh, not willingly, but on account of hope. For though he thought it better[fn-62-P6219_970914:75-nf] to be dissolved and to be with Christ, it was not unreasonable that he should wish to remain in the flesh for the sake of the benefit to others and of advancement in the things hoped for, not only by him, but also by those benefited by him. This meaning of the term\" beginning,\" as of origin, will serve us also in the passage in which Wisdom speaks in the Proverbs.[fn-62-P6220_971299:76-nf] \"God,\" we read, \"created me the beginning of His ways, for His works.\" Here the term could be interpreted as in the first application we spoke of, that of a way: \"The Lord,\" it says, \"created me the beginning of His ways.\" One might assert, and with reason, that God Himself is the beginning of all things, and might go on to say, as is plain, that the Father is the beginning of the Son; and the demiurge the beginning of the works of the demiurge, and that God in a word is the beginning of all that exists. This view is supported by our: \"In the beginning was the Word.\" In the Word one may see the Son, and because He is in the Father He may be said to be in the beginning.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":3,"verse":25,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_39_homily_xxxiii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"52","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"But for bodily mutilation and indignity, mark how he practised himself.

For when divine judgment is reasoning with men it must speak with the language and feelings of men. For when a doctor for the sake of health with good reason either cuts or cauterizes those who are suffering from the inflammation of ulcers, it is considered an evil by those who have to bear it. Nor are the spur and the whip pleasant to a restive horse. Moreover all chastisement seems at the moment to be a bitter thing to those who are chastised, as the Apostle says: \"Now all chastisement for the present indeed seemeth not to bring with it joy but sorrow; but afterwards it will yield to them that are exercised by it most peaceable fruits of righteousness,\" and \"whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth: for what son is there whom the father doth not correct?\"[fn-42-P4290_1581725:20-nf] And so evils are sometimes wont to stand for afflictions, as where we read: \"And God repented of the evil which He had said that He would do to them and He did it not.\"[fn-42-P4291_1581915:21-nf] And again: \"For Thou, Lord, are gracious and merciful, patient and very merciful and ready to repent of the evil,\"[fn-42-P4292_1582057:22-nf] i.e., of the sufferings and losses which Thou art forced to bring upon us as the reward of our sins. And another prophet, knowing that these are profitable to some men, and certainly not through any jealousy of their safety, but with an eye to their good, prays thus: \"Add evils to them, O Lord, add evils to the haughty ones of the earth;\"[fn-42-P4293_1582423:23-nf] and the Lord Himself says \"Lo, I will bring evils upon them,\"[fn-42-P4294_1582511:24-nf] i.e., sorrows, and losses, with which they shall for the present be chastened for their soul's health, and so shall be at length driven to return and hasten back to Me whom in their prosperity they scorned. And so that these are originally evil we cannot possibly assert: for to many they conduce to their good and offer the occasions of eternal bliss, and therefore (to return to the question raised) all those things, which are thought to be brought upon us as evils by our enemies or by any other people, should not be counted as evils, but as things indifferent. For in the end they will not be what he thinks, who brought them upon us in his rage and fury, but what he makes them who endures them. And so when death has been brought upon a saint, we ought not to think that an evil has happened to him but a thing indifferent; which is an evil to a wicked man, while to the good it is rest and freedom from evils. \"For death is rest to a man whose way is hidden.\"[fn-42-P4295_1583498:25-nf] And so a good man does not suffer any loss from it, because he suffers nothing strange, but by the crime of an enemy he only receives (and not without the reward of eternal life) that which would have happened to him in the course of nature, and pays the debt of man's death, which must be paid by an inevitable law, with the interest of a most fruitful passion, and the recompense of a great reward.","title":"VI.

There iS a time to keep silence and a time to speak,[fn-53-P5302_1658217:3-nf] is the saying of the Preacher. Time enough has been given to silence, and now the time has come to open my mouth for the publication of the truth concerning matters that are, up to now, unknown. The illustrious Job bore his calamities for a long time in silence, and ever showed his courage by holding out under the most intolerable sufferings, but when he had struggled long enough in silence, and had persisted in covering his anguish in the bottom of his heart, at last he opened his mouth and uttered his well-known words.[fn-53-P5303_1658763:4-nf] In my own case this is now the third year of my silence, and my boast has become like that of the Psalmist \"I was as a man that heareth not and in whose mouth are no reproofs.\"[fn-53-P5304_1658961:5-nf] Thus I shut up in the bottom of my heart the pangs which I suffered on account of the calumnies directed against me, for calumny humbles a man, and calumny makes a poor man giddy.[fn-53-P5305_1659161:6-nf] If, therefore, the mischief of calumny is so great as to cast down even the perfect man from his height, for this is what Scripture indicates by the word man, and by the poor man is meant he who lacks the great doctrines, as is the view also of the prophet when he says, \"These are poor, therefore they shall not hear; ... I will get me unto the great men,\"[fn-53-P5306_1659648:7-nf] he means by poor those who are lacking in understanding; and here, too, he plainly means those who are not yet furnished in the inner man, and have not even come to the full measure of their age; it is.these who are said by the proverb to be made giddy and tossed about. Nevertheless I thought that I ought to bear my troubles in silence, waiting for some indication to come out of them. I did not even think that what was said against me proceeded from ill will; I thought it was the result of ignorance of the truth. But now I see that hostility increases with time, and that my slanderers are not sorry for what they said at the beginning, and do not take any trouble to make amends for the past, but go on and on and rally themselves together to attain their original object. This was to make my life miserable and to devise means for sullying my reputation among the brethren. I, therefore, no longer see safety in silence. I have bethought me of the words of Isaiah: \"I have long time holden my peace, shall I always be still and refrain myself? I have been patient like a travailing woman.\"[fn-53-P5307_1660766:8-nf] God grant that I may both receive the reward of silence, and gain some strength to confute my opponents, and that thus, by confuting them, I may dry up the bitter torrent of falsehood that has gushed out against me.

So I continually set forth the life of the unmarried maid, and described how \"the unmarried\" alone \"careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit.\"[fn-32-P3276_1074743:22-nf] I used to describe the high dignity of virginity, and, addressing you as a temple of God, used as it were to give wings to your zeal as I strove to lift you to Jesus. Yet through fear of evil I helped you not to fall by the words \"if any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy.\"[fn-32-P3277_1075056:23-nf] So by my prayers I tried to make you more secure, if by any means \"your body, soul, and spirit might be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.\"[fn-32-P3278_1075244:24-nf] Yet all my toil on your behalf has been in vain. Bitter to me has been the end of those sweet labours. Now I needs must groan again at that over which I ought to have rejoiced. You have been deceived by the serpent more bitterly than Eve; and not only your mind but also your body has been defiled. Even that last horror has come to pass which I shrink from saying, and yet cannot leave unsaid, for it is as a burning and blazing fire in my bones, and I am undone and cannot endure. You have taken the members of Christ and made them the members of a harlot.[fn-32-P3279_1075824:25-nf] This is an evil with which no other can be matched. This outrage in life is new. \"For pass over the Isles of Chittim and see; and send unto Chedar and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing. Hath a nation changed their gods which are yet no gods.\"[fn-32-P3280_1076107:26-nf] But the virgin has changed her glory, and her glory is in her shame. The heavens are astonished at this, and the earth is horribly afraid, saith the Lord, for the virgin has committed two evils; she has forsaken[fn-32-P3281_1076341:27-nf] Me, the true and holy Bridegroom of holy souls, and has betaken herself to an impious and lawless destroyer of body and soul alike. She has revolted from God, her Saviour, and yielded her members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity.[fn-32-P3282_1076609:28-nf] She forgot me and went after her lover[fn-32-P3283_1076670:29-nf] from whom she will get no good.","title":"Letter XLVI","author":"St. Basil"}]
