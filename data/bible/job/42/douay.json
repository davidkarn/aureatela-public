{"verses":["Then Job answered the Lord, and said:","I know that thou canst do all things, and no thought is hid from\nthee.","Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge?  Therefore I\nhave spoken unwisely, and things that above measure exceeded my\nknowledge.","Hear, and I will speak:  I will ask thee, and do thou tell me.","With the hearing of the ear, I have heard thee, but now my eye\nseeth thee.","Therefore I reprehend myself, and do penance in dust and ashes.","And after the Lord had spoken these words to Job, he said to\nEliphaz the Themanite:  My wrath is kindled against thee, and against\nthy two friends, because you have not spoken the thing that is right\nbefore me, as my servant Job hath.","Take unto you therefore seven oxen and seven rams, and go to my\nservant Job, and offer for yourselves a holocaust, and my servant Job\nshall pray for you:  his face I will accept, that folly be not imputed\nto you:  for you have not spoken right things before me, as my servant\nJob hath.","So Eliphaz the Themanite, and Baldad the Suhite, and Sophar the\nNaamathite went, and did as the Lord had spoken to them, and the Lord\naccepted the face of Job.","The Lord also was turned at the penance of Job, when he prayed\nfor his friends.  And the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.","And all his brethren came to him, and all his sisters, and all\nthat knew him before, and they ate bread with him in his house:  and\nbemoaned him, and comforted him upon all the evil that God had brought\nupon him.  And every man gave him one ewe, and one earring of gold.","And the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his\nbeginning.  And he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels,\nand a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.","And he had seven sons, and three daughters.","And he called the name of one Dies, and the name of the second\nCassia, and the name of the third Cornustibii.","And there were not found in all the earth women so beautiful as\nthe daughters of Job:  and their father gave them inheritance among\ntheir brethren.","And Job lived after these things, a hundred and forty years, and\nhe saw his children, and his children's children, unto the fourth\ngeneration, and he died an old man, and full of days."]}
