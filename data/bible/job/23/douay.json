{"verses":["Then Job answered, and said:","Now also my words are in bitterness, and the hand of my scourge\nis more grievous than my mourning.","Who will grant me that I might know and find him, and come even\nto his throne?","I would set judgment before him, and would fill my mouth with\ncomplaints.","That I might know the words that he would answer me, and\nunderstand what he would say to me.","I would not that he should contend with me with much strength,\nnor overwhelm me with the weight of his greatness.","Let him propose equity against me, and let my judgment come to\nvictory.","But if I go to the east, he appeareth not; if to the west, I\nshall not understand him.","If to the left hand, what shall I do?  I shall not take hold on\nhim:  if I turn myself to the right hand, I shall not see him.","But he knoweth my way, and has tried me as gold that passeth\nthrough the fire:","My foot hath followed his steps, I have kept his way, and have\nnot declined from it.","I have not departed from the commandments of his lips, and the\nwords of his mouth I have hid in my bosom.","For he is alone, and no man can turn away his thought:  and\nwhatsoever his soul hath desired, that hath he done.","And when he shall have fulfilled his will in me, many other like\nthings are also at hand with him.","And therefore I am troubled at his presence, and when I consider\nhim I am made pensive with fear.","God hath softened my heart, and the Almighty hath troubled me.","For I have not perished because of the darkness that hangs over\nme, neither hath the mist covered my face."]}
