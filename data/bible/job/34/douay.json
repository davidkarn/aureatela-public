{"verses":["And Eliu continued his discourse, and said:","Hear ye, wise men, my words, and ye learned, hearken to me:","For the ear trieth words, and the mouth discerneth meats by the\ntaste.","Let us choose to us judgment, and let us see among ourselves what\nis the best.","For Job hath said:  I am just, and God hath overthrown my\njudgment.","For in judging me there is a lie:  my arrow is violent without any\nsin.","What man is there like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?","Who goeth in company with them that work iniquity, and walketh\nwith wicked men?","For he hath said:  Man shall not please God, although he run with\nhim.","Therefore, ye men of understanding, hear me:  far from God be\nwickedness, and iniquity from the Almighty.","For he will render to a man his work, and according to the ways\nof every one he will reward them.","For in very deed God will not condemn without cause, neither\nwill the Almighty pervert judgment.","What other hath he appointed over the earth?  or whom hath he set\nover the world which he made?","If he turn his heart to him, he shall draw his spirit and breath\nunto himself.","All flesh shall perish together, and man shall return into\nashes.","If then thou hast understanding, hear what is said, and hearken\nto the voice of my words.","Can he be healed that loveth not judgment?  and how dost thou so\nfar condemn him that is just?","Who saith to the king:  Thou art an apostate:  who calleth rulers\nungodly:","Who accepteth not the persons of princes:  nor hath regarded the\ntyrant, when he contended against the poor man:  for all are the work of\nhis hands.","They shall suddenly die, and the people shall be troubled at\nmidnight, and they shall pass, and take away the violent without hand.","For his eyes are upon the ways of men, and he considereth all\ntheir steps.","There is no darkness, and there is no shadow of death, where\nthey may be hid who work iniquity.","For it is no longer in the power of man to enter into judgment\nwith God.","He shall break in pieces many and innumerable, and shall make\nothers to stand in their stead.","For he knoweth their works:  and therefore he shall bring night\non them, and they shall be destroyed.","He hath struck them, as being wicked, in open sight.","Who as it were on purpose have revolted from him, and would not\nunderstand all his ways:","So that they caused the cry of the needy to come to him, and he\nheard the voice of the poor.","For when he granteth peace, who is there that can condemn?  When\nhe hideth his countenance, who is there that can behold him, whether it\nregard nations, or all men?","Who maketh a man that is a hypocrite to reign for the sins of\nthe people?","Seeing then I have spoken of God, I will not hinder thee in thy\nturn.","If I have erred, teach thou me:  if I have spoken iniquity, I\nwill add no more.","Doth God require it of thee, because it hath displeased thee?\nfor thou begannest to speak, and not I:  but if thou know any thing\nbetter, speak.","Let men of understanding speak to me, and let a wise man hearken\nto me.","But Job hath spoken foolishly, and his words sound not\ndiscipline.","My father, let Job be tried even to the end:  cease not from the\nman of iniquity.","Because he addeth blasphemy upon his sins, let him be tied fast\nin the mean time amongst us:  and then let him provoke God to judgment\nwith his speeches."]}
