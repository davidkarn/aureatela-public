But worship thou One God the Almighty, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Flee from the error of many gods, flee also from every heresy, and say like Job, But I will call upon the Almighty Lord, which doeth great things and unsearchable, glorious things and marvellous without number[fn-10-P1046_270238:25-nf] , and, For all these things there is honour from the Almighty[fn-10-P1047_270489:26-nf] : to Whom be the glory for ever and ever.
