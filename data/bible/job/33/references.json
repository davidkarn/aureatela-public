We acknowledge that the word of truth has in many places made use of these expressions; yet we absolutely deny that the freedom of the Spirit is in bondage to the pettiness of Paganism. On the contrary, we maintain that Scripture varies its expressions as occasion requires, according to the circumstances of the case. For instance, the phrase \"of which\" does not always and absolutely, as they suppose, indicate the material,[fn-11-P1166_275824:20-nf] but it is more in accordance with the usage of Scripture to apply this term in the case of the Supreme Cause, as in the words \"One God, of whom are all things,\"[fn-11-P1167_276074:21-nf] and again, \"All things of God.\"[fn-11-P1168_276783:22-nf] The word of truth has, however, frequently used this term in the case of the material, as when it says \"Thou shalt make an ark of incorruptible wood;\"[fn-11-P1169_276955:23-nf] and \"Thou shall make the candlestick of pure gold ;\"[fn-11-P1170_277028:24-nf] and \"The first man is of the earth, earthy;[fn-11-P1171_277426:25-nf] and \"Thou art formed out of clay as I am.\"[fn-11-P1172_277487:26-nf] But these men, to the end, as we have already remarked, that they may establish the difference of nature, have laid down the law that this phrase befits the Father alone. This distinction they have originally derived from heathen authorities, but here they have shewn no faithful accuracy of limitation. To the Son they have in conformity with the teaching of their masters given the title of instrument, and to the Spirit that of place, for they say in the Spirit, and through the Son. But when they apply \"of whom\" to God they no longer follow heathen example, but \"go over, as they say, to apostolic usage, as it is said, \"But of him are ye in Christ Jesus,\"[fn-11-P1173_278169:27-nf] and \"All things of God.\"[fn-11-P1174_278219:28-nf] What, then, is the result of this systematic discussion? There is one nature of Cause; another of Instrument; another of Place. So the Son is by nature distinct from the Father, as the tool from the craftsman; and the Spirit is distinct in so far as place or time is distinguished from the nature of tools or from that of them that handle them.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":33,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"143","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"49. And His operations, what are they? For majesty ineffable, and for numbers innumerable. How shall we form a conception of what extends beyond the ages? What were His operations before that creation whereof we can conceive? How great the grace which He conferred on creation? What the power exercised by Him over the ages to come? He existed; He pre-existed; He co-existed with the Father and the Son before the ages. It follows that, even if you can conceive of anything beyond the ages, you will find the Spirit yet further above and beyond. And if you think of the creation, the powers of the heavens were established by the Spirit,[fn-16-P1676_426445:422-nf] the establishment being understood to refer to disability to fall away from good. For it is from the Spirit that the powers derive their close relationship to God, their inability to change to evil, and their continuance in blessedness. Is it Christ's advent? The Spirit is forerunner. Is there the incarnate presence? The Spirit is inseparable. Working of miracles, and gifts of healing are through the Holy Spirit. Demons were driven out by the Spirit of God. The devil was brought to naught by the presence of the Spirit. Remission of Sins was by the gift of the Spirit, for \"ye were washed, ye were sanctified, ... in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the holy Spirit of our God.\"[fn-16-P1677_427160:423-nf] There is close relationship with God through the Spirit, for \"God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying Abba, Father.\"[fn-16-P1678_427330:424-nf] The resurrection from the dead is effected by the operation of the Spirit, for \"Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created; and Thou renewest the face of the earth.\"[fn-16-P1679_427527:425-nf] If here creation may be taken to mean the bringing of the departed to life again, how mighty is not the operation of the Spirit, Who is to us the dispenser of the life that follows on the resurrection, and attunes our souls to the spiritual life beyond? Or if here by creation is meant the change to a better condition of those who in this life have fallen into sin, (for it is so understood according to the usage of Scripture, as in the words of Paul \"if any man be in Christ he is a new creature\"[fn-16-P1680_428053:426-nf] ), the renewal which takes place in this life, and the transmutation from our earthly and sensuous life to the heavenly conversation which takes place in us through the Spirit, then our souls are exalted to the highest pitch of admiration. With these thoughts before us are we to be afraid of going beyond due bounds in the extravagance of the honour we pay? Shall we not rather fear lest, even though we seem to give Him the highest names which the thoughts of man can conceive or man's tongue utter, we let our thoughts about Him fall too low?","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":33,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_14_book_ii_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"71","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"44. How is it, too, that Job plainly set forth the Spirit as his Creator, saying: \"The Spirit of God hath made me\"?[fn-26-P2669_622449:56-nf] In one short verse he showed Him to be both Divine and Creator. If, then, the Spirit is Creator, He is certainly not a creature, for the Apostle has separated the Creator and the creature, saying: \"They served the creature rather than the Creator.\"[fn-26-P2670_622718:57-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"St. Ambrose"},{"chapter":33,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_15_book_iii_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"200","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"139.

This Spirit shares with the Son in working both the Creation and the Resurrection, as you may be shewn by this Scripture; By the Word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the power of them by the breath of His Mouth;[fn-54-P5420_1811901:57-nf] and this, The Spirit of God that made me, and the Breath of the Almighty that teacheth me;[fn-54-P5421_1812012:58-nf] and again, Thou shalt send forth Thy Spirit and they shall be created, and Thou shalt renew the face of the earth.[fn-54-P5422_1812148:59-nf] And He is the Author of spiritual regeneration. Here is your proof:-None can see or enter into the Kingdom, except he be born again of the Spirit,[fn-54-P5423_1812313:60-nf] and be cleansed from the first birth, which is a mystery of the night, by a remoulding of the day and of the Light, by which every one singly is created anew. This Spirit, for He is most wise and most loving,[fn-54-P5424_1812540:61-nf] if He takes possession of a shepherd makes him a Psalmist, subduing evil spirits by his song,[fn-54-P5425_1812651:62-nf] and proclaims him King; if he possess a goatherd and scraper[fn-54-P5426_1812733:63-nf] of sycamore fruit,[fn-54-P5427_1813146:64-nf] He makes him a Prophet. Call to mind David and Amos. If He possess a goodly youth, He makes him a Judge of Elders,[fn-54-P5428_1813280:65-nf] even beyond his years, as Daniel testifies, who conquered the lions in their den.[fn-54-P5429_1813377:66-nf] If He takes possession of Fishermen, He makes them catch the whole world in the nets of Christ, taking them up in the meshes of the Word. Look at Peter and Andrew and the Sons of Thunder, thundering the things of the Spirit. If of Publicans, He makes gain of them for discipleship, and makes them merchants of souls; witness Matthew, yesterday a Publican, today an Evangelist. If of zealous persecutors, He changes the current of their zeal, and makes them Pauls instead of Sauls, and as full of piety as He found them of wickedness. And He is the Spirit of Meekness, and yet is provoked by those who sin. Let us therefore make proof of Him as gentle, not as wrathful, by confessing His Dignity; and let us not desire to see Him implacably wrathful. He too it is who has made me today a bold herald to you;-if without rest to myself, God be thanked; but if with risk, thanks to Him nevertheless; in the one case, that He may spare those that hate us; in the other, that He may consecrate us, in receiving this reward of our preaching of the Gospel, to be made perfect by blood.","title":"Oration XLI.","author":"Gregory Nazianzen"}]
