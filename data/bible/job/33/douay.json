{"verses":["Hear therefore, O Job, my speeches, and hearken to all my words.","Behold now I have opened my mouth, let my tongue speak within my\njaws.","My words are from my upright heart, and my lips shall speak a\npure sentence.","The spirit of God made me, and the breath of the Almighty gave me\nlife.","If thou canst, answer me, and stand up against my face.","Behold God hath made me as well as thee, and of the same clay I\nalso was formed.","But yet let not my wonder terrify thee, and let not my eloquence\nbe burdensome to thee.","Now thou hast said in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of\nthy words:","I am clean, and without sin:  I am unspotted, and there is no\niniquity in me.","Because he hath found complaints against me, therefore he hath\ncounted me for his enemy.","He hath put my feet in the stocks, he hath observed all my\npaths.","Now this is the thing in which thou art not justified:  I will\nanswer thee, that God is greater than man.","Dost thou strive against him, because he hath not answered thee\nto all words?","God speaketh once, and repeateth not the selfsame thing the\nsecond time.","By a dream in a vision by night, when deep sleep falleth upon\nmen, and they are sleeping in their beds:","Then he openeth the ears of men, and teaching instructeth them\nin what they are to learn.","That he may withdraw a man from the things he is doing, and may\ndeliver him from pride.","Rescuing his soul from corruption:  and his life from passing to\nthe sword.","He rebuketh also by sorrow in the bed, and he maketh all his\nbones to wither.","Bread becometh abominable to him in his life, and to his soul\nthe meat which before he desired.","His flesh shall be consumed away, and his bones that were\ncovered shall be made bare.","His soul hath drawn near to corruption, and his life to the\ndestroyers.","If there shall be an angel speaking for him, one among\nthousands, to declare man's uprightness,","He shall have mercy on him, and shall say:  Deliver him, that he\nmay not go down to corruption:  I have found wherein I may be merciful\nto him.","His flesh is consumed with punishments, let him return to the\ndays of his youth.","He shall pray to God, and he will be gracious to him:  and he\nshall see his face with joy, and he will render to man his justice.","He shall look upon men, and shall say:  I have sinned, and indeed\nI have offended, and I have not received what I have deserved.","He hath delivered his soul from going into destruction, that it\nmay live and see the light.","Behold, all these things God worketh three times within every\none.","That he may withdraw their souls from corruption, and enlighten\nthem with the light of the living.","Attend, Job, and hearken to me, and hold thy peace, whilst I\nspeak.","But if thou hast any thing to say, answer me, speak:  for I would\nhave thee to appear just.","And if thou have not, hear me:  hold thy peace, and I will teach\nthee wisdom."]}
