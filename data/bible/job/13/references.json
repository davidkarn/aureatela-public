For if He should enter into judgment with him, he would not be able to obey Him.\"[fn-8-P834_493022:67-nf] And shortly afterwards he asks: \"Who shall resist His judgment? Even if I should seem righteous, my mouth will speak profanely.\"[fn-8-P835_493171:68-nf] And again, further on, he says: \"I know He will not leave me unpunished. But since I am ungodly, why have I not died? If I should wash myself with snow, and be purged with clean hands, thou hadst thoroughly stained me with filth.\"[fn-8-P836_493423:69-nf] In another of his discourses he says: \"For Thou hast written evil things against me, and hast compassed me with the sins of my youth; and Thou hast placed my foot in the stocks. Thou hast watched all my works, and hast inspected the soles of my feet, which wax old like a bottle, or like a moth-eaten garment. For man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live, and is full of wrath; like a flower that hath bloomed, so doth he fall; he is gone like a shadow, and continueth not. Hast Thou not taken account even of him, and caused him to enter into judgment with Thee? For who is pure from uncleanness? Not even one; even should his life last but a day.\"[fn-8-P837_494107:70-nf] Then a little afterwards he says: \"Thou hast numbered all my necessities; and not one of my sins hath escaped Thee. Thou hast sealed up my transgressions in a bag, and hast marked whatever I have done unwillingly.\"[fn-8-P838_494352:71-nf] See how Job, too, confesses his sins, and says how sure he is that there is none righteous before the Lord. So he is sure of this also, that if we say we have no sin, the truth is not in us. While, therefore, God bestows on him His high testimony of righteousness, according to the standard of human conduct, Job himself, taking his measure from that rule of righteousness, which, as well as he can, he beholds in God, knows of a truth that so it is; and he goes on at once to say, \"How shall a mortal man be just before the Lord? For if He should enter into judgment with him, he would not be able to obey Him;\" in other words, if, when challenged to judgment, he wished to show that nothing could be found in him which He could condemn, \"he would not be able to obey him,\" since he misses even that obedience which might enable him to obey Him who teaches that sins ought to be confessed. Accordingly [the Lord] rebukes certain men, saying, \"Why will ye contend with me in judgment?\"[fn-8-P839_495359:72-nf] This [the Psalmist] averts, saying, \"Enter not into judgment with Thy servant; for in Thy sight shall no man living be justified.\"[fn-8-P840_495508:73-nf] In accordance with this, Job also asks: \"For who shall resist his judgment? Even if I should seem righteous, my mouth will speak profanely;\" which means: If, contrary to His judgment, I should call myself righteous, when His perfect rule of righteousness proves me to be unrighteous, then of a truth my mouth would speak profanely, because it would speak against the truth of God.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_18_concerning_man_s_perfection_in_righteousness","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"103","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"The same thing is affirmed in another passage, which he has quoted immediately afterwards, as spoken by the same Job: \"Behold, I am very near my judgment, and I know that I shall be found righteous.\"[fn-25-P2574_1026773:103-nf] Now this is the judgment of which it is said in another scripture: \"And He shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.\" But he does not say, I am already there; but, \"I am very near.\" If, indeed, the judgment of his which he meant was not that which he would himself exercise, but that whereby he was to be judged at the last day, then in such judgment all will be found righteous who with sincerity pray: \"Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.\"[fn-25-P2575_1027290:104-nf] For it is through this forgiveness that they will be found righteous; on this account that whatever sins they have here incurred, they have blotted out by their deeds of charity. Whence the Lord says: \"Give alms; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.\"[fn-25-P2576_1027569:105-nf] For in the end, it shall be said to the righteous, when about to enter into the promised kingdom: \"I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat,\"[fn-25-P2577_1027729:106-nf] and so forth. However, it is one thing to be without sin, which in this life can only be predicated of the Only-begotten, and another thing to be without accusation, which might be said of many just persons even in the present life; for there is a certain measure of a good life, according to which even in this human intercourse there could no just accusation be possibly laid against him. For who can justly accuse the man who wishes evil to no one, and who faithfully does good to all he can, and never cherishes a wish to avenge himself on any man who does him wrong, so that he can truly say, \"As we forgive our debtors?\" And yet by the very fact that he truly says, \"Forgive, as we also forgive,\" he plainly admits that he is not without sin.","title":"Concerning Man's Perfection in Righteousness","author":"Augustine"}]
