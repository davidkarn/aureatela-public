{"verses":["Then Sophar the Naamathite answered, and said:","Therefore various thoughts succeed one another in me, and my mind\nis hurried away to different things.","The doctrine with which thou reprovest me, I will hear, and the\nspirit of my understanding shall answer for me.","This I know from the beginning, since man was placed upon the\nearth,","That the praise of the wicked is short, and the joy of the\nhypocrite but for a moment.","If his pride mount up even to heaven, and his head touch the\nclouds:","In the end he shall be destroyed like a dunghill, and they that\nhad seen him, shall say:  Where is he?","As a dream that fleeth away he shall not be found, he shall pass\nas a vision of the night:","The eyes that had seen him, shall see him no more, neither shall\nhis place any more behold him.","His children shall be oppressed with want, and his hands shall\nrender to him his sorrow.","His bones shall be filled with the vices of his youth, and they\nshall sleep with him in the dust.","For when evil shall be sweet in his mouth, he will hide it under\nhis tongue.","He will spare it, and not leave it, and will hide it in his\nthroat.","His bread in his belly shall be turned into the gall of asps\nwithin him,","The riches which he hath swallowed, he shall vomit up, and God\nshall draw them out of his belly.","He shall suck the head of asps, and the viper's tongue shall\nkill him.","Let him not see the streams of the river, the brooks of honey\nand of butter.","He shall be punished for all that he did, and yet shall not be\nconsumed:  according to the multitude of his devices so also shall he\nsuffer.","Because he broke in and stripped the poor:  he hath violently\ntaken away a house which he did not build.","And yet his belly was not filled:  and when he hath the things he\ncoveted, he shall not be able to possess them.","There was nothing left of his meat, and therefore nothing shall\ncontinue of his goods:","When he shall be filled, he shall be straitened, he shall burn,\nand every sorrow shall fall upon him.","May his belly be filled, that God may send forth the wrath of\nhis indignation upon him, and rain down his war upon him.","He shall flee from weapons of iron, and shall fall upon a bow of\nbrass.","The sword is drawn out, and cometh forth from its scabbard, and\nglittereth in his bitterness:  the terrible ones shall go and come upon\nhim.","All darkness is hid in his secret places:  a fire that is not\nkindled shall devour him, he shall be afflicted when left in his\ntabernacle.","The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, and the earth shall rise\nup against him.","The offspring of his house shall be exposed, he shall be pulled\ndown in the day of God's wrath.","This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the\ninheritance of his doings from the Lord."]}
