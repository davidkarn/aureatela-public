{"verses":["Job also added, taking up his parable, and said:","As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment, and the Almighty,\nwho hath brought my soul to bitterness,","As long as breath remaineth in me, and the spirit of God in my\nnostrils,","My lips shall not speak iniquity, neither shall my tongue\ncontrive lying.","God forbid that I should judge you to be just:  till I die I will\nnot depart from my innocence.","My justification, which I have begun to hold, I will not forsake:\nfor my heart doth not reprehend me in all my life.","Let my enemy be as the ungodly, and my adversary as the wicked\none.","For what is the hope of the hypocrite if through covetousness he\ntake by violence, and God deliver not his soul?","Will God hear his cry, when distress shall come upon him?","Or can he delight himself in the Almighty, and call upon God at\nall times?","I will teach you by the hand of God, what the Almighty hath, and\nI will not conceal it.","Behold you all know it, and why do you speak vain things without\ncause?","This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the\ninheritance of the violent, which they shall receive of the Almighty.","If his sons be multiplied, they shall be for the sword, and his\ngrandsons shall not be filled with bread.","They that shall remain of him, shall be buried in death, and his\nwidows shall not weep.","If he shall heap together silver as earth, and prepare raiment\nas clay,","He shall prepare indeed, but the just man shall be clothed with\nit:  and the innocent shall divide the silver.","He hath built his house as a moth, and as a keeper he hath made\na booth.","The rich man when he shall sleep shall take away nothing with\nhim:  he shall open his eyes and find nothing.","Poverty like water shall take hold on him, a tempest shall\noppress him in the night:","A burning wind shall take him up, and carry him away, and as a\nwhirlwind shall snatch him from his place.","And he shall cast upon him, and shall not spare:  out of his hand\nhe would willingly flee.","He shall clasp his hands upon him, and shall hiss at him,\nbeholding his place."]}
