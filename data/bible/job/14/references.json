But even as touching this I must not be ungrateful to my Master. I know that the human soul is spiritual not corporeal, that it is endowed with reason and intelligence, and that it is not of God's essence but a thing created. It is both mortal and immortal: the first because it is subject to corruption and separable from the life of God in which it is alone blessed, the second because its consciousness must ever continue and form the source of its happiness or woe. It does not, it is true, owe its immersion in the flesh to acts done before the flesh; yet in man it is never without sin, not even when \"its life has been but for one day.\"[fn-55-P5506_1535327:3911-nf] Of those engendered of the seed of Adam no man is born without sin, and it is necessary even for babes to be born anew in Christ by the grace of regeneration.

I rejoice to have learned it all and I can truly say that I know it. If there are things of which I am still ignorant (as whether God creates souls by generation or apart from it-for that He does create them I have no doubt) I would sooner know the truth than be ignorant of it.

So much also does Scripture testify, according to the words which we already quoted. For wherein does their opinion, who designate baptism by the term salvation, differ from what is written: \"He saved us by the washing of regeneration?\"[fn-4-P481_383676:105-nf] or from Peter's statement: \"The like figure where-unto even baptism doth also now save us?\"[fn-4-P482_383788:106-nf] And what else do they say who call the sacrament of the Lord's Supper life, than that which is written: \"I am the living bread which came down from heaven;\"[fn-4-P483_383968:107-nf] and \"The bread that I shall give is my flesh, for the life of the world ;\"[fn-4-P484_384063:108-nf] and \"Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, ye shall have no life in you?\"[fn-4-P485_384183:109-nf] If, therefore, as so many and such divine witnesses agree, neither salvation nor eternal life can be hoped for by any man without baptism and the Lord's body and blood, it is vain to promise these blessings to infants without them. Moreover, if it be only sins that separate man from salvation and eternal life, there is nothing else in infants which these sacraments can be the means of removing, but the guilt of sin,-respecting which guilty nature it is written, that \"no one is clean, not even if his life be only that of a day.\"[fn-4-P486_384737:110-nf] Whence also that exclamation of the Psalmist: \"Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me!\"[fn-4-P487_384876:111-nf] This is either said in the person of our common humanity, or if of himself only David speaks, it does not imply that he was born of fornication, but in lawful wedlock. We therefore ought not to doubt that even for infants yet to be baptized was that precious blood shed, which previous to its actual effusion was so given, and applied in the sacrament, that it was said, \"This is my blood, which shall be shed for many for the remission of sins.\"[fn-4-P488_385341:112-nf] Now they who will not allow that they are under sin, deny that there is any liberation.

It never entered his mind, however, along with this conceit, to venture to affirm that children of men are born without original sin. If, indeed, he had added such an opinion, the women might have more readily consented to marry, to give birth to such pure offspring. When this man's writings (for he dared to write) were by the brethren forwarded to Jerome to refute, he not only discovered no such error in them, but, while looking out his conceits for refutation, he found among other passages this very clear testimony to the doctrine of man's original sin, from which Jerome indeed felt satisfied of the man's belief of that doctrine.[fn-11-P1183_616709:28-nf] These are his words when treating of it: \"He who says that he abides in Christ, ought himself also to walk even as He walked.[fn-11-P1184_616900:29-nf] We give our opponent the option to choose which alternative he likes. Does he abide in Christ, or does he not? If he does, then, let him walk like Christ. If, however, it is a rash thing to undertake to resemble the excellences of Christ, he abides not in Christ, because he walks not as Christ did.

Now John confesses himself a sinner, and hopes for forgiveness of sins after baptism. My friend Jovinianus says,[fn-65-P6595_2065178:6-nf] \"Touch me not, for I am clean.\" What then?

If we give Christ a lodging-place in our hearts, we banish the devil from thence. If we sin and the devil enter through the gate of sin, Christ will immediately withdraw. Hence David after sinning says:[fn-65-P6598_2066751:9-nf] \"Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation,\" that is, the joy which he had lost by sinning.[fn-65-P6599_2066858:10-nf] \"He who saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.\" Christ is called the truth:[fn-66-P6600_2067007:11-nf] \"I am the way, the truth, and the life.\" In vain do we make our boast in him whose commandments we keep not.

Now, if he were not himself righteous, he would never be commanded to offer for others. Nor, again, would he offer for himself if he were free from sins of ignorance.

And therefore we must explain how we are to understand the words, \"as in the primitive days, and as in former years;\" for perhaps he alludes to the time in which our first parents were in paradise.

And consequently, since it must be believed that after such a cleansing the righteous shall retain no sin, assuredly that time, so far as regards its freedom from sin, can be compared to no other period, unless to that during which our first parents lived in paradise in the most innocent happiness before their transgression. It is this period, then, which is properly understood when it is said, \"as in the primitive days, and as in former years.\" For in Isaiah, too, after the new heavens and the new earth have been promised, among other elements in the blessedness of the saints which are there depicted by allegories and figures, from giving an adequate explanation of which I am prevented by a desire to avoid prolixity, it is said, \"According to the days of the tree of life shall be the days of my people.\"[fn-40-P4024_2206730:151-nf] And who that has looked at Scripture does not know where God planted the tree of life, from whose fruit He excluded our first parents when their own iniquity ejected them from paradise, and round which a terrible and fiery fence was set?","title":"Book XX","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":14,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_28_book_ii_","source_chapter":52,"source_paragraph":"166","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"As to the passage, which he seemed to himself to indite in a pious vein, as it were, \"If nature is of God, there cannot be original sin in it,\" would not another person seem even to him to give a still more pious turn to it, thus: \"If nature is of God, there cannot arise any sin in it?\" And yet this is not true. The Manicheans, indeed, meant to assert this, and they endeavoured to steep in all sorts of evil the very nature of God itself, and not His creature, made out of nothing. For evil arose in nothing else than what was good-not, however, the supreme and unchangeable good which is God's nature, but that which was made out of nothing by the wisdom of God. This, then, is the reason why man is claimed for a divine work; for he would not be man unless he were made by the operation of God.

For who can be so wanting in the more important subjects of thought as to waste energy on silly arguments, and to contend with men who speak of us as asserting that \"man's forethought is of superior weight and authority to God's guardianship,\" and that we \"ascribe the carelessness which confuses the feebler minds to the providence of God\"? These are the exact words of our calumniator. But I, for my part, think it equally as absurd to pay attention to remarks like that, as to occupy myself with old wives' dreams. For to think of securing the dignity of rule and sovereignty to the Divine Being by a form of words, and to show the great power of God to be dependent upon this, and on the other hand to neglect Him and disregard the providence which belongs to Him, and to lay it to our reproach that men, having received from God the faculty of reason, make an arbitrary use of words to signify things-what is this but an old wife's fable, or a drunkard's dream? For the true power, and authority, and dominion, and sovereignty of God do not, we think, consist in syllables. Were it so, any and every inventor of words might claim equal honour with God. But the infinite ages, and the beauties of the universe, and the beams of the heavenly luminaries, and all the wonders of land and sea, and the angelic hosts and supra-mundane powers, and whatever else there is whose existence in the realm above is revealed to us under various figures by Holy Scripture-these are the things that bear witness to God's power over all. Whereas, to attribute the invention of vocal sound to those who are naturally endowed with the faculty of speech, this involves no impiety towards Him Who gave them their voice. Nor indeed do we hold it to be a great thing to invent words significative of things. For the being to whom Holy Scripture in the history of the creation gave the name of \"man[fn-22-P2286_1484210:70-nf] \" (anqrwpoj), a word of human devising, that same being Job calls \"mortal[fn-22-P2287_1484301:71-nf] \" (brotoj), while of profane writers, some call him \"human being\" (fwj), and others \"articulate speaker\" (me/roy)-to say nothing of other varieties of the name. Do we, then, elevate them to equal honour with God, because they also invented names equivalent to that of \"man,\" alike signifying their subject. But, as I have said before, let us leave this idle talk, and make no account of his string of revilings, in which he charges us with lying against the Divine oracles, and uttering slanders with effrontery even against God.","title":"Answer to Eunomius' Second Book","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":14,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"411","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In Job: \"For who is pure from filth?

What advantage is it to them, that in the praise of the creature they say \"that the good God is the maker of those that are born, by whom all things were made, and that the children of men are His work,\" whom the Manicheans say are the work of the prince of darkness; when between them both, or among them both, God's creation, which is in infants, is perishing? For both of them refuse to have it delivered by Christ's flesh and blood,-the one, because they destroy that very flesh and blood, as if He did not take upon Him these at all in man or of man; and the other, because they assert that there is no evil in infants from which they should be delivered by the sacrament of this flesh and blood. Between them lies the human creature in infants, with a good origination, with a corrupted propagation, confessing for its goods a most excellent Creator, seeking for its evils a most merciful Redeemer, having the Manicheans as disparagers of its benefits, having the Pelagians as deniers of its evils, and both as persecutors. And although in infancy there is no power to speak, yet with its silent look and its hidden weakness it addresses the impious vanity of both, saying to the one, \"Believe that I am created by Him who creates good things;\" and saying to the other, \"Suffer me to be healed by Him who created me.\" The Manicheans say, \"There is nothing of this infant save the good soul to be delivered; the rest,\" which belongs not to the good God, but to tile prince of darkness, \"is to be rejected.\"' The Pelagians say, \"Certainly there is nothing of this infant to be delivered, because we have shown the whole to be safe.\" Both lie; but now the accuser of the flesh alone is more bearable than the praiser, who is convicted of cruelty against the whole. But neither does tile Manichean help the human soul by blaspheming God, the Author of the entire man; nor does the Pelagian permit the divine grace to come to the help of human infancy by denying original sin. Therefore it is by the catholic faith that God has mercy, seeing that by condemning both mischievous doctrines it comes to the help of the infant for salvation. It says to the Manicheans, \"Hear the apostle crying, 'Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost in you?'[fn-55-P5585_2198296:7-nf] anti believe that the good God is the Creator of bodies, because the temple of the Holy Ghost cannot be the work of the prince of darkness.\" It says to the Pelagians, \"The infant that you look upon 'was conceived in iniquity, and in sin its mother nourished it in the womb.'[fn-55-P5586_2198589:8-nf] Why, as if in defending it as free from all mischief, do you not permit it to be delivered by mercy?

In the epistle on \"Works and Alms,\" he says: \"Let us then acknowledge, beloved brethren, the wholesome gift of the divine mercy, and let us who cannot be without some wound of conscience heal our wounds by the spiritual remedies for the cleansing and purging of our sins. Nor let any one so flatter himself with the notion of a pure and immaculate heart, as, in dependence on his own innocence, to think that the medicine needs not to be applied to his wounds; since it is written, `Who shall boast that he hath a clean heart, or who shall boast that he is pure from sins?'[fn-57-P5737_2255687:90-nf] And again, in his epistle, John lays it down and says, 'If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.'[fn-57-P5738_2255843:91-nf] But if no one can be without sin, and whoever should say that he is without fault is either proud or foolish, how needful, how kind is the divine mercy, which, knowing that there are still found some wounds in those that have been healed, I has given even after their healing wholesome remedies for the curing and healing of their wounds anew!\"[fn-57-P5739_2256206:92-nf] Again, in the same treatise he says: \"And since there cannot fail daily to be sins committed in the sight of God, there failed not daily sacrifices wherewith the sins might be cleansed away.\"[fn-57-P5740_2256472:93-nf] Also, in the treatise on the Mortality, he says: \"Our warfare is with avarice, with immodesty, with anger, with ambition; our trying and toilsome wrestling with carnal vices, with the enticements of the world. The mind of man besieged, and on every hand invested with the onsets of the devil, scarcely meets the repeated attacks, scarcely resists them.If avarice is prostrated, lust springs up. If lust is overcome, ambition takes its place. If ambition is despised, anger exasperates, pride puffs up, wine-bibbing entices; envy breaks concord: jealousy cuts friendship; you are constrained to curse, which the divine law forbids; you are compelled to swear, which is not lawful. So many persecutions the soul suffers daily, with so many risks is the heart wearied; and yet it delights to abide here long among the devil's weapons, although it should rather be our craving and wish to hasten to Christ by the aid of a quicker death.\"[fn-57-P5741_2257426:94-nf] Again, in the same treatise he says: \"The blessed Apostle Paul in his epistle lays it down, saying, `To me to live is Christ, and to die is gain;'[fn-57-P5742_2257615:95-nf] counting it the greatest gain no longer to be held by the snares of this world, no longer to be liable to the sins and vices of the flesh.\"[fn-57-P5743_2257773:96-nf] Moreover, on the Lord's Prayer, explaining what it is we ask when we say, \"Hallowed be thy name,\" he says, among other matters: \"For we have need of daily sanctification, that we, who daily fall away, may wash out our sins by continual sanctification.\"[fn-57-P5744_2258046:97-nf] Again, in the same treatise, when he would explain our saying, \"Forgive us our debts,\" he says: \"And how necessarily, how providently and salutarily, are we admonished that we are sinners, since we are compelled to entreat for our sins; and while pardon is asked for from God, the soul recalls its own consciousness of guilt. Lest any one should flatter himself as being innocent, and by exalting himself should more deeply perish, he is instructed and taught that he sins daily, in that he is bidden to entreat daily for his sins. Thus, moreover, John also in his epistle warns us, and says: `If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. But if we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins.'\"[fn-57-P5745_2258840:98-nf] Rightly, also, he proposed in his letter to Quirinus his own most absolute judgment on this subject, to which he subjoined the divine testimonies, \"That no one is without filth and without sin.\"[fn-57-P5746_2259080:99-nf] There also he set down those testimonies by which original sin is confirmed, which these men endeavour to twist into I know not what new and evil meanings, whether what the holy Job says, \"No one is pure from filth not one even if his life be of one day upon the earth,\"[fn-57-P5747_2259424:100-nf] or what is read in the Psalm, \"Behold, I was conceived in iniquity; and in sins hath my mother nourished me in the womb.\"[fn-57-P5748_2259568:101-nf] To which testimonies, on account of those also who are already holy in mature age, since even they are not without filth and sin, he added also that word of the most blessed John, which he often mentions in many other places besides, \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves;\"[fn-57-P5749_2259875:102-nf] and other passages of the same sentiment, which are asserted by all catholics, by way of opposing those \"who deceive themselves, and the truth is not in them.\"","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":14,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_129_tractate_cxxiv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"5. I shall therefore, in the manifested mercy of Him whose justice is hidden, set about the discussion, in order to the solution of a question of such importance, in accordance with the strength which He may graciously bestow: for hitherto it has only been proposed, not expounded. Let this, then, be the commencement of its exposition, namely, that we bear in mind that in this corruptible body, which burdens the soul,[fn-39-P3906_2156569:8-nf] we live a miserable life. But we who are now redeemed by the Mediator, and have received the earnest of the Holy Spirit, have a blessed life in prospect, although we possess it not as yet in reality. But a hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.[fn-39-P3907_2156945:9-nf] And it is in the evils that every one suffers, not in the good things that he enjoys, that he has need of patience. The present life, therefore, whereof it is written, \"Is not the life of man a term of trial upon earth?\"[fn-39-P3908_2157189:10-nf] in which we are daily crying to the Lord, \"Deliver us from evil,\"[fn-39-P3909_2157272:11-nf] a man is compelled to endure, even when his sins are forgiven him, although it was the first sin that caused his falling into such misery. For the penalty is more protracted than the fault; test the fault should be accounted small, were the penalty to end with itself. On this account it is also, either for the demonstration of our debt of misery, or for the amendment of our passing life, or for the exercise of the necessary patience, that man is kept through time in the penalty, even when he is no longer held by his sin as liable to everlasting damnation. This is the truly lamentable but unblameable condition of the present evil days we pass in this mortal state, even while in it we look with loving eyes to the days that are good. For it comes from the righteous anger of God, whereof the Scriptures say, \"Man, that is born of woman, is of few days and full of anger:\"[fn-39-P3910_2158170:12-nf] for the anger of God is not like that of man, the disturbance of an excited man, but the calm fixing of righteous punishment. In this anger of His, God restraineth not, as it is written, His tender mercies;[fn-39-P3911_2158394:13-nf] but, besides other consolations to the miserable, which He ceaseth not to bestow on mankind, in the fullness of time, when He knew that such had to be done, He sent His only-begotten Son,[fn-39-P3912_2158602:14-nf] by whom He created all things, that He might become man while remaining God, and so be the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus:[fn-39-P3913_2158762:15-nf] that those who believe in Him, being absolved by the layer of regeneration from the guilt of all their sins,-to wit, both of the original sin they have inherited by generation, and to meet which, in particular, regeneration was instituted, and of all others contracted by evil conduct,-might be delivered from perpetual condemnation, and live in faith and hope and love while sojourning in this world, and be walking onward to His visible presence amid its toilsome and perilous temptations on the one hand, but the consolations of God, bothbodily and spiritual, on the other, ever keeping to the way which Christ has become to them. And because, even while walking in Him, they are not exempt from sins, which creep in through the infirmities of this life, He has given them the salutary remedies of alms whereby their prayers might be aided when He taught them to say, \"Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.\"[fn-39-P3914_2159709:16-nf] So does the Church act in blessed hope through this troublous life; and this Church symbolized in its generality, was personified in the Apostle Peter, on account of the primacy of his apostleship. For, as regards his proper personality, he was by nature one man, by grace one Christian, by still more abounding grace one, and yet also, the first apostle; but when it was said to him, \"I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven,\" he represented the universal Church, which in this world is shaken by divers temptations, that come upon it like torrents of rain, floods and tempests, and falleth not, because it is founded upon a rock (petra), from which Peter received his name. For petra (rock) is not derived from Peter, but Peter from petra; just as Christ is not called so from the Christian, but the Christian from Christ. For on this very account the Lord said, \"On this rock will I build my Church,\" because Peter had said, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\"[fn-39-P3915_2160858:17-nf] On this rock, therefore, He said, which thou hast confessed. I will build my Church. For the Rock (Petra) was Christ;[fn-39-P3916_2160999:18-nf] and on this foundation was Peter himself also built. For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Christ Jesus.[fn-39-P3917_2161148:19-nf] The Church, therefore, which is rounded in Christ received from Him the keys of the kingdom of heaven in the person of Peter, that is to say, the power of binding and loosing sins. For what the Church is essentially in Christ, such representatively is Peter in the rock (petra); and in this representation Christ is to be understood as the Rock, Peter as the Church. This Church, accordingly, which Peter represented, so long as it lives amidst evil, by loving and following Christ is delivered from evil. But its following is the closer in those who contend even unto death for the truth. But to the universality[fn-39-P3918_2161783:20-nf] [of the Church] is it said, \"Follow me,\" even as it was for the same universality that Christ suffered: of whom this same Peter saith, \"Christ suffered for us, leaving us an example, that we should follow His footsteps.\"[fn-39-P3919_2162023:21-nf] This, then, you see is why it was said to him, \"Follow me.\" But there is another, an immortal life, that is not in the midst of evil: there we shall see face to face what is seen here through a glass and in a riddle,[fn-39-P3920_2162260:22-nf] even when much progress is made in the beholding of the truth. There are two states of life, therefore, preached and commended to herself from heaven, that are known to the Church, whereof the one is in faith, the other in sight; one in the temporal sojourn in a foreign land, the other in the eternity of the [heavenly] abode; one in labor, the other in repose; one on the way, the other in the fatherland; one in active work, the other in the wages of contemplation; one declines from evil and makes for good, the other has no evil to decline from, and has great good to enjoy; the one fights with a foe, the other reigns without a foe; the one is brave in the midst of adversities, the other has no experience of adversity; the one is bridling its carnal lusts, the other has full scope for spiritual delights; the one is anxious with the care of conquering, the other secure in the peace of victory; the one is helped in temptations, the other, free from all temptations, rejoices in the Helper Himself; the one is occupied in relieving the indigent, the other is there, where no indigence is found; the one pardons the sins of others, that its own may be pardoned to itself, the other neither has anything to pardon nor does aught for which pardon has to be asked; the one is scourged with evils that it may not be elated with good things, the other is free from all evil by such a fullness of grace that, without any temptation to pride, it may cleave to that which is supremely good; the one discerneth both good and evil, the other has only that which is good presented to view: therefore the one is good, but miserable as yet; the other, better and blessed. This one was signified by the Apostle Peter, that other by John. The whole of the one is passed here to the end of this world, and there finds its termination, the other is deferred for its completion till after the end of this world, but has no end in the world to come. Hence it is said to the latter, \"Follow me;\" but of the former, \"Thus I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee follow thou me.\" For what means this last? So far as my wisdom goes, so far as I comprehend, what is it but this, Follow thou me by imitating me in the endurance of temporal evils; let him remain till I come to restore everlasting good? And this may be expressed more clearly in this way: Let perfected action, informed by the example of my passion, follow me; but let contemplation only begun remain [so] till I come, to be perfected when I come. For the godly plenitude of patience, reaching forward even unto death, followeth Christ; but the fullness of knowledge tarrieth till Christ come, to be manifested then. For here the evils of this world are endured in the land of the dying, while there shall be seen the good things of the Lord in the land of the living. For in saying, \"I wish him to tarry till I come,\" we are not to understand Him as meaning to remain on, or abide permanently, but to wait; seeing that what is signified by him shall certainly not be fulfilled now, but when Christ is come. But what is signified by him to whom it was said, \"Follow thou me,\" unless it be done now, will never attain to the expected end. And in this life of activity. the more we love Christ the more easily are we delivered from evil. But He loveth us less as we now are, and therefore delivers from it, that we may not be always such as we are.

My beloved, men who are inferior in understanding, dispute about this that I write to\nthee, and say:-\"What is the place in which the righteous shall receive a good reward; and what is the\nplace in which are torments, in which the wicked shall receive the punishments of their works?\" O man\nthat thinkest thus, I will ask thee, and tell thou me, why is death called death, and why is Sheol\ncalled Sheol? For it is written that when Korah and his companions made a schism against Moses,\nthe earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up, and they went down alive into Sheol.[fn-46-P4671_1574238:35-nf] Therefore that was the mouth of Sheol that was\nopened in the wilderness. David also said, The wicked shall turn back to Sheol.[fn-46-P4672_1574388:36-nf] We say that to Sheol, in which Korah and his\ncompanions were swallowed up, thither shall the wicked be turned back. For God has power, if He\nchooses, to give inheritance of life in heaven, and if it please Him, in the earth. Jesus our Lord\nsaid, Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.[fn-46-P4673_1574721:37-nf] And to one of those who were crucified with Him,\nwho believed on him He swore:-Thou shalt be with Me to-day in the garden Eden.[fn-46-P4674_1574865:38-nf] And the Apostle said, When the righteous shall\nrise again, they shall fly upwards to meet our Redeemer.[fn-46-P4675_1574991:39-nf] But, however, we say thus: That which our\nRedeemer said to us is true:-Heaven and earth shall pass away.[fn-46-P4676_1575118:40-nf] And the Apostle said, Hope which is seen is\nnot hope.[fn-46-P4677_1575193:41-nf] And the Prophet said, The\nheavens shall pass away as smoke, and the earth as a garment shall wear away; and its inhabitants\nshall become like it.[fn-46-P4678_1575359:42-nf] And Job said\nconcerning those that sleep, Till the heavens wear out, they shall not be aroused, nor shall they\nwake out of their sleep.[fn-46-P4679_1575511:43-nf] From these\nthings be thou persuaded that this earth, in which the children of Adam are sown, and the firmament\nthat is over men, (even) that firmament which is set to divide the upper heavens from the earth and\nthis life, shall pass away, and wear out, and be destroyed. And God will make a new thing for the\nchildren of Adam, and they shall inherit inheritances in the Kingdom of Heaven. If He shall give them\ninheritance in the earth, it shall be called the kingdom of heaven. And if in Heaven, it is easy for\nHim to do. For with the kings of the earth also, although each one of them abides in his own place,\nyet every place to which their authority extends, is called their kingdom. So the sun is a luminary\nset in the heaven, yet for every place to which its rays extend, its authority suffices, whether on\nsea or on land. And observe that the princes of the world also have banquetings and delights, and in\nevery place or state into which they go, their banquetings are with them; and in whatever place\npleases them, they make a prison-house. For the sun in twelve hours circles round, from the east unto\nthe west; and when he has accomplished his course, his light is hidden in the night-time, and the\nnight is not disturbed by his power. And in the hours of the night the sun turns round in his rapid\ncourse, and turning round begins to run in his accustomed path. As for the sun that is with thee,\nthou wise man, from thy childhood till the completion of thy old age, thou knowest not where he runs\nin the night-time, so as to circle round to the place of its course.

And if one who has not sinned at all incur suffering-a rare case-yet even he will not suffer aught through the machinations of power, but will suffer as the child which seems not to have sinned would suffer.\" Then further on he adds: \"As, then, the child which has not sinned before, or committed actual sin in itself, but has that which committed sin, when subjected to suffering, gets good, reaping the advantage of many difficulties; so also, although a perfect man may not have sinned in act, while he endures afflictions, he suffers similarly with the child. Having within him the sinful principle, but not embracing the opportunity of committing sin, he does not sin; so that he is not to be reckoned as not having sinned. For as he who wishes to commit adultery is an adulterer, although he does not succeed in committing adultery; and he that wishes to commit murder is a murderer, although he is unable to kill; so also, if I see the man without sin, whom I specify, suffering, though he have done nothing bad, I should call him bad, on account of his wishing to sin. For I will affirm anything rather than call Providence evil.\" Then, in continuation, he says expressly concerning the Lord, as concerning man: \"If then, passing from all these observations, you were to proceed to put me to shame by saying, perchance impersonating certain parties, This man has then sinned; for this man has suffered;-if you permit, I will say, He has not sinned; but was like a child suffering. If you were to insist more urgently, I would say, That the man you name is man, but that God is righteous: `` For no one is pure, ''as one said, `from pollution.'\"[fn-68-P6845_2090243:118-nf] But the hypothesis of Basilides[fn-68-P6846_2090295:119-nf] says that the soul, having sinned before in another life, endures punishment in this-the elect soul with honour by martyrdom, the other purged by appropriate punishment. How can this be true, when the confessing and suffering punishment or not depends on ourselves? For in the case of the man who shall deny, Providence, as held by Basilides, is done away with. I will ask him, then, in the case of a confessor who has been arrested, whether he will confess and be punished in virtue of Providence or not? For in the case of denying he will not be punished. But if, for the sake of escaping and evading the necessity of punishing such an one, he shall say that the destruction of those who shall deny is of Providence, he will be a martyr against his will. And how any more is it the case, that there is laid up in heaven the very glorious recompense to him who has witnessed, for his witnessing? If Providence did not permit the sinner to get the length of sinning, it is unjust in both cases; both in not rescuing the man who is dragged to punishment for righteousness' sake, and in having rescued him who wished to do wrong, he having done it as far as volition was concerned, but [Providence] having prevented the deed, and unjustly favoured the sinner. And how impious, in deifying the devil, and in daring to call the Lord a sinful man! For the devil tempting us, knowing what we are, but not knowing if we will hold out, but wishing to dislodge us from the faith, attempts also to bring us into subjection to himself. Which is all that is allowed to him, partly from the necessity of saving us, who have taken occasion from the commandment, from ourselves; partly for the confusion of him who has tempted and failed; for the confirmation of the members of the Church, and the conscience of those who admire the constancy [displayed]. But if martyrdom be retribution by way of punishment, then also faith and doctrine, on account of which martyrdom comes, are co-operators in punishment-than which, what other absurdity could be greater? But with reference to these dogmas, whether the soul is changed to another body, also of the devil, at the proper time mention will be made. But at present, to what has been already said, let us add the following: Where any more is faith in the retribution of sins committed before martyrdom takes place? And where is love to God, which is persecuted and endures for the truth? And where is the praise of him who has confessed, or the censure of him who has denied? And for what use is right conduct, the mortification of the lusts, and the hating of no creature? But if, as Basilides himself says, we suppose one part of the declared will of God to be the loving of all things because all things bear a relation to the whole, and another \"not to lust after anything,\" and a third \"not to hate anything,\" by the will of God these also will be punishments, which it were impious to think. For neither did the Lord suffer by the will of the Father, nor are those who are persecuted by the will of God; since either of two things is the case: either persecution in consequence of the will of God is a good thing, or those who decree and afflict are guiltless. But nothing is without the will of the Lord of the universe. It remains to say that such things happen without the prevention of God; for this alone saves both the providence and the goodness of God. We must not therefore think that He actively produces afflictions (far be it that we should think this!); but we must be persuaded that He does not prevent those that cause them, but overrules for good the crimes of His enemies: \"I will therefore,\" He says, \"destroy the wall, and it shall be for treading under foot.\"[fn-68-P6847_2094279:120-nf] Providence being a disciplinary art;[fn-68-P6848_2094334:121-nf] in the case of others for each individual's sins, and in the case of the Lord and His apostles for ours. To this point says the divine apostle: \"For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye abstain from fornication: that each one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour; not in the lust of concupiscence, as the Gentiles who know not the Lord: that none of you should overreach or take advantage of his brother in any matter; because the Lord is the avenger in respect of all such, as we also told you before, and testified. For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but to holiness. Wherefore he that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given His Holy Spirit to you.\"[fn-68-P6849_2095192:122-nf] Wherefore the Lord was not prohibited from this sanctification of ours. if, then, one of them were to say, in reply, that the martyr is punished for sins committed before this embodying, and that he will again reap the fruit of his conduct in this life, for that such are the arrangements of the [divine administration], we shall ask him if the retribution takes place by Providence. For if it be not of the divine administration, the economy of expiations is gone, and their hypothesis falls to the ground; but if expiations are by Providence, punishments are by Providence too. But Providence, although it begins, so to speak, to move with the Ruler, yet is implanted in substances along with their origin by the God of the universe. Such being the case, they must confess either that punish-merit is not just, and those who condemn and persecute the martyrs do right, or that persecutions even are wrought by the will of God. Labour and fear are not, then, as they say, incident to affairs as rust to iron, but come upon the soul through its own will. And on these points there is much to say, which will be reserved for future consideration, taking them up in due course.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":14,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_61_book_ii_","source_chapter":100,"source_paragraph":"436","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"232.

Or who can believe that those regular movements and courses are the products of a certain unregulated impetus? Or who can allow that the perfect concord subsisting among the celestial bodies derives its harmony from instruments destitute both of concord and harmony? Or, again, if there is but one and the same substance[fn-14-P1416_396934:43-nf] in all things, and if there is the same incorruptible nature[fn-14-P1417_397010:44-nf] in all,-the only elements of difference being, as they aver, size and figure,-how comes it that there are some bodies divine and perfect,[fn-14-P1418_397163:45-nf] and eternal,[fn-14-P1419_397192:46-nf] as they would phrase it, or lasting,[fn-14-P1420_397244:47-nf] as some one may prefer to express it; and among these some that are visible and others that are invisible,-the visible including such as sun, and moon, and stars, and earth, and water; and the invisible including gods, and demons, and spirits? For the existence of such they cannot possibly deny however desirous to do so. And again, there are other objects that are long-lived, both animals and plants. As to animals, there are, for example, among birds, as they say, the eagle, the raven, and the phoenix; and among creatures living on land, there are the stag, and the elephant, and the dragon; and among aquatic creatures there are the whales, and such like monsters of the deep. And as to trees, there are the palm, and the oak, and the persea;[fn-14-P1421_398011:48-nf] and among trees, too, there are some that are evergreens, of which kind fourteen have been reckoned up by some one; and there are others that only bloom for a certain season, and then shed their leaves. And there are other objects, again-which indeed constitute the vast mass of all which either grow or are begotten-that have an early death and a brief life. And among these is man himself, as a certain holy scripture says of him: \"Man that is born of woman is of few days.\"[fn-14-P1422_398576:49-nf] Well, but I suppose they will reply that the varying conjunctions of the atoms account fully for differences[fn-14-P1423_398702:50-nf] so great in the matter of duration. For it is maintained that there are some things that are compressed together by them, and firmly interlaced, so that they become closely compacted bodies, and consequently exceedingly hard to break up; while there are others in which more or less the conjunction of the atoms is of a looser and weaker nature, so that either quickly or after some time they separate themselves from their orderly constitution. And, again, there are some bodies made up of atoms of a definite kind and a certain common figure, while there are others made up of diverse atoms diversely disposed. But who, then, is the sagacious discriminator,[fn-14-P1424_399430:51-nf] that brings certain atoms into collocation, and separates others; and marshals some in such wise as to form the sun, and others in such a way as to originate the moon, and adapts all in natural fitness, and in accordance with the proper constitution of each star? For surely neither would those solar atoms, with their peculiar size and kind, and with their special mode of collocation, ever have reduced themselves so as to effect the production of a moon; nor, on the other hand, would the conjunctions of these lunar atoms ever have developed into a sun. And as certainly neither would Arcturus, resplendent as he is, ever boast his having the atoms possessed by Lucifer, nor would the Pleiades glory in being constituted of those of Orion. For well has Paul expressed the distinction when he says: \"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.\"[fn-14-P1425_400397:52-nf] And if the coalition effected among them has been an unintelligent one, as is the case with soulless[fn-14-P1426_400518:53-nf] objects, then they must needs have had some sagacious artificer; and if their union has been one without the determination of will, and only of necessity, as is the case with irrational objects, then some skilful leader[fn-14-P1427_400754:54-nf] must have brought them together and taken them under his charge. And if they have linked themselves together spontaneously, for a spontaneous work, then some admirable architect must have apportioned their work for them, and assumed the superintendence among them; or there must have been one to do with them as the general does who loves order and discipline, and who does not leave his army in an irregular condition, or suffer all things to go on confusedly, but marshals the cavalry in their proper succession, and disposes the heavy-armed infantry in their due array, and the javelin-men by themselves, and the archers separately, and the slingers in like manner, and sets each force in its appropriate position, in order that all those equipped in the same way may engage together. But if these teachers think that this illustration is but a joke, because I institute a comparison between very large bodies and very small, we may pass to the very smallest.","title":"Part I.-Containing Various Sections of the Works.","author":"Dionysius"},{"chapter":14,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_46_tractate_xli_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"9.

But because the devil had not shown himself so violent in his attack on the first man as to bring him over to his side without the consent of His free will, man's voluntary sin and hostile desires had to be destroyed in such wise that the standard of justice should not stand in the way of the gift of Grace. And therefore in the general ruin of the entire human race there was but one remedy in the secret of the Divine plan which could succour the fallen, and that was that one of the sons of Adam should be born free and innocent of original transgression, to prevail for the rest both by His example and His merits. Still further, because this was not permitted by natural generation, and because there could be no offspring from our faulty stock without seed, of which the Scripture saith, \"Who can make a clean thing conceived of an unclean seed? is it not Thou who art alone[fn-31-P3184_768860:5-nf] ?\" David's Lord was made David's Son, and from the fruit of the promised branch[fn-31-P3185_768955:6-nf] sprang.
