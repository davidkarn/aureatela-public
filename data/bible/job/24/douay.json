{"verses":["Times are not hid from the Almighty:  but they that know him, know\nnot his days.","Some have removed landmarks, have taken away flocks by force, and\nfed them.","They have driven away the ass of the fatherless, and have taken\naway the widow's ox for a pledge.","They have overturned the way of the poor, and have oppressed\ntogether the meek of the earth.","Others like wild asses in the desert go forth to their work:  by\nwatching for a prey they get bread for their children.","They reap the field that is not their own, and gather the vintage\nof his vineyard whom by violence they have oppressed.","They send men away naked, taking away their clothes who have no\ncovering in the cold:","Who are wet, with the showers of the mountains, and having no\ncovering embrace the stones.","They have violently robbed the fatherless, and stripped the poor\ncommon people.","From the naked and them that go without clothing, and from the\nhungry they have taken away the ears of corn.","They have taken their rest at noon among the stores of them, who\nafter having trodden the winepresses suffer thirst.","Out of the cities they have made men to groan, and the soul of\nthe wounded hath cried out, and God doth not suffer it to pass\nunrevenged.","They have been rebellious to the light, they have not known his\nways, neither have they returned by his paths.","The murderer riseth at the very break of day, he killeth the\nneedy, and the poor man:  but in the night he will be as a thief.","The eye of the adulterer observeth darkness, saying:  No eye\nshall see me:  and he will cover his face.","He diggeth through houses in the dark, as in the day they had\nappointed for themselves, and they have not known the light.","If the morning suddenly appear, it is to them the shadow of\ndeath:  and they walk in darkness as if it were in light.","He is light upon the face of the water:  cursed be his portion on\nthe earth, let him not walk by the way of the vineyards.","Let him pass from the snow waters to excessive heat, and his sin\neven to hell.","Let mercy forget him:  may worms be his sweetness:  let him be\nremembered no more, but be broken in pieces as an unfruitful tree.","For he hath fed the barren that beareth not, and to the widow he\nhath done no good.","He hath pulled down the strong by his might:  and when he\nstandeth up, he shall not trust to his life.","God hath given him place for penance, and he abuseth it unto\npride:  but his eyes are upon his ways.","They are lifted up for a little while and shall not stand, and\nshall be brought down as all things, and shall be taken away, and as\nthe tops of the ears of corn they shall be broken.","And if it be not so, who can convince me that I have lied, and\nset my words before God?"]}
