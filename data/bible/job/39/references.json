[XI.] And what sort of rebuke is this, - which, moreover, is understood to proceed from the person of Christ our Lord? He re-counts to him all the divine operations of His power, rebuking him under this idea,-that He seems to say to him, \"Canst thou effect all thesemighty works as I can?\" But to what purposeis all this but that Job might understand (forthis instruction was divinely inspired into him, that he might foreknow Christ's coming to suffer),-that he might understand how patiently he ought to endure all that he went through, since Christ, although, when He became man for us, He was absolutely without sin, and although as God He possessed so great power, did for all that by no means refuse to obey even to the suffering of death? When Job understood this with a purer intensity of heart, he added to his own answer these words: \"I used before now to hear of Thee by the hearing of the ear; but behold now mine eye seeth Thee: therefore I abhor myself and melt away, and account myself but dust and ashes.\"[fn-8-P852_499613:79-nf] Why was he thus so deeply displeased with himself? God's work, in that he was man, could not rightly have given him displeasure, since it is even said to God Himself, \"Despise not Thou the work of Thine own hands.\"[fn-8-P853_499849:80-nf] It was indeed in view of that righteousness, in which he had discovered his own unrighteousness,[fn-8-P854_499968:81-nf] that he abhorred himself and melted away, and deemed himself dust and ashes,-beholding, as he did in his mind, the righteousness of Christ, in whom there could not possibly be any sin, not only in respect of His divinity, but also of His soul and His flesh. It was also in view of this righteousness which is of God that the Apostle Paul, although as \"touching the righteousness which is of the law he was blameless,\" yet \"counted all things\" not only as loss, but even as dung.[fn-8-P855_500574:82-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":39,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_13_homily_vi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"[\"Ye men of Israel\"]: it is not for flattery that he uses this term; but, as he has borne hard upon them, he relaxes a little, and puts them in mind of their great ancestor[fn-4-P410_239100:1-nf] [Israel]. Here again he begins with an introduction, that they may not become excited, now that he is going to make express mention to them of Jesus: for in what preceded, there was no reason why they should be excited, while the Prophet was the subject of discourse: but the name of Jesus would have given offence at the very outset.-And he does not say, \"Do as I bid you,\" but, Hear; as being not at all exacting. And observe how he forbears to speak of the high matters, and begins with the very low: \"Jesus,\" he says: and then straightway mentions the place He belonged to, being one which was held in mean estimation: \"Jesus of Nazareth\": and does not say anything great about Him, nor even such as one would say about a Prophet, so far: \"Jesus,\" he says, \"of Nazareth, a man proved (to be) from God among you.\" Observe; what great matter was this, to say that He was sent from God?[fn-4-P411_240211:2-nf] For this was the point which on all occasions both He and John and the Apostles were studious to show. Thus hear John saying: \"The same said unto me On whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and abiding on him, this is He.\" (John i. 33.) But Christ Himself does this to an extreme; Of Myself I am not come, He sent Me. (ib. vii. 28.) And everywhere in the Scriptures this seems the point most studiously insisted upon. Therefore also this holy leader of the blessed company, the lover of Christ, the good shepherd, the man put in trust with the keys of heaven, the man who received the Spiritual Wisdom, when he has first subdued the Jews by fear; and has shown what great things have been vouchsafed to the disciples, and what a right they have to be believed, then first proceeds to speak concerning Him. Only think what boldness it was to say it, in the midst of the murderers-that He is risen! And yet he does not all at once say, He is risen; but what?-\" He came,\" says he, \"from God: this is manifest by the signs which\"-he does not yet say, Jesus Himself wrought: but what?-\"which God wrought by Him in the midst of you.\" He calls themselves as witnesses. \"A man proved (to be sent) from God among you, by miracles and wonders and signs, which God wrought by him in the midst of you, as also ye yourselves know.\" Then, having fallen upon the mention of that their sacrilegious outrage, observe how he endeavors to quit them of the crime: \"Him,\" he says, \"being by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God delivered up\": (v. 23) [adding however,] \"ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:\" for though it was predetermined, still they were murderers.[fn-4-P412_243525:3-nf] [\"By the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God:\"] all but using the same words as Joseph did; just as he said to his brethren; \"Be not angry one with another by the way: God sent me hither.\" (Gen. xlv. 5, Gen. xlv. 24.) It is God's doing. \"What of us, then?\" (it might be said,) \"it was even well done on our part.\" That they may not say this, therefore it is that he adds, \"By wicked hands ye have crucified and slain.\"[fn-4-P413_244351:4-nf] Here then he hints at Judas; while at the same time he shows them that it was not from any strength of theirs, and would not have been, if He had not Himself permitted it: it was God that delivered Him up. He has transferred the evil entire upon the head of Judas, now already parted from them; for he it was that delivered Him over to them by the kiss. Or, \"By wicked hands,\" refers to the soldiers: for neither is it simply, \"Ye have slain,\" but, By wicked men ye have done this.[fn-4-P414_245167:5-nf] And observe how everywhere they make it of great importance that the Passion should first be confessed. Whom God Raised Up (v. 24), says he. This was the great thing; and observe how he sets it in the middle of his discourse: for the former matters had been confessed; both the miracles and the signs and the slaying-\"Whom God,\" says he, \"raised up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible that He should be kept in its power.\" It is something great and sublime that he has hinted at here. For the expression, \"It was not possible,\" even itself is that of one assigning something.[fn-4-P415_246408:6-nf] It shows that death itself in holding Him had pangs as in travail, and was sore bestead:[fn-4-P416_248616:7-nf] whereas, by pains, or, travail-pangs, of death, the Old Testament means danger and disaster: and that He so rose as never more to die. For the assertion, \"Seeing that it was not possible that He should be holden of it,\" means this, that His rising was not common to the rest. Then, however, before their thoughts can enter at all into his meaning, he brings David upon them, an authority which sets aside all human reasoning. \"For David saith (with reference) to Him.\" (v. 25.) And observe how, once more, the testimony is lowly. For therefore he begins the citation further up, with the matters of lowlier import therefore[fn-4-P417_250050:8-nf] was death not in the number of grievous things [because], says he, \"I foresaw the Lord always before my face, that He is on my right hand that I should not be moved:\" (v. 25-27) and, \"that Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell.\" Then, having finished the citation from the Prophet, he adds; \"Men and brethren.\" (v. 29.) When he is about to say anything great, he uses this opening address, to rouse and to conciliate them. \"Let me be allowed,\" he says, \"to speak freely to you of the patriarch David.\" Remarkable lowliness, in a case where he was giving no hurt, nor was there any reason why the hearers should be angry. For he did not say, This is not said concerning David, but concerning the Christ. But in another point of view: by his reverential expression towards the blessed David, he awed them; speaking of an acknowledged fact as if it were a bold thing to say, and therefore begging them to pardon him for saying it. And thereupon his expression is not simply \"concerning David,\" but \"concerning the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried:\" he does not also say, \"and is not risen again,\" but in another way (though this too would have been no great thing to say), \"And his sepulchre is with us unto this day,\" he has said what comes to the same thing. Then-and even so he does not come to the mention of Christ, but what next?-he goes on with his encomium upon David, \"Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that with an oath God had sworn unto him.\" (v. 30.) But this he says, that were it but on account of the honor shown to David, and the descent from him, they may accept what is said concerning Christ's resurrection, as seeing that it would be an injury to the prophecy, and a derogating from (thj eij autouj timhj) their honor, if this were not the fact. \"And knowing,\" he says, \"that with an oath God had sworn unto him\"-he does not say simply \"promised\"-\"of the fruit of his loins after the flesh to raise up Christ, to seat Him upon his throne.\" Observe how he has again only hinted at what is sublime. For now that he has soothed them with his expression, he confidently adds this: The prophet [saith it] \"of His resurrection, that neither was His soul left in hell, nor did His flesh see corruption.\" (v. 31.) This again is wonderful: it shows that His resurrection was not like that of other men. For though death laid hold on Him, yet it did not its own work then.-And, as regards the sin, he has spoken of that, covertly and darkly; of the punishment, he forbore to add anything; but that they had slain Him, this he has spoken out; for the rest he now comes to the sign given by God. And when it is once proved, that He, the slain, was just, was dear to God, then, though thou be silent of the punishment, be sure that he which did the sin will condemn himself more than ever thou canst condemn him: So then, that he refers all to the Father, is in order that they may receive what is said: and that assertion, \"Not possible,\" he fetches in from the prophecy. Well then, let us again look over what has been said.","title":"Homily VI.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":39,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_13_homily_vi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"[\"Ye men of Israel\"]: it is not for flattery that he uses this term; but, as he has borne hard upon them, he relaxes a little, and puts them in mind of their great ancestor[fn-4-P410_239100:1-nf] [Israel].
