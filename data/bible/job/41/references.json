Jesus sanctified Baptism by being Himself baptized. If the Son of God was baptized, what godly man is he that despiseth Baptism? But He was baptized not that He might receive remission of sins, for He was sinless; but being sinless, He was baptized, that He might give to them that are baptized a divine and excellent grace. For since the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise partook of the same[fn-4-P419_84782:48-nf] , that having been made partakers of His presence in the flesh we might be made partakers also of His Divine grace: thus Jesus was baptized, that thereby we again by our participation might receive both salvation and honour. According to Job, there was in the waters the dragon that draweth up Jordan into his mouth[fn-4-P420_85116:49-nf] . Since, therefore, it was necessary to break the heads of the dragon in pieces[fn-4-P421_85213:50-nf] , He went down and bound the strong one in the waters, that we might receive power to tread upon serpents and scorpions[fn-4-P422_85353:51-nf] .

You say `he is the universal cause of sin;' and, while you make him the author of all crimes, you free men from fault, and take away the freedom of the will. Our Lord says that[fn-92-P9259_2491178:11-nf] `from our heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnesses, railings,' and of Judas we read in the Gospel;[fn-92-P9260_2491346:12-nf] \"After the sop Satan entered into him,\" that is, because he had before the sop sinned voluntarily, and had not been brought to repentance either by humbling himself or by the forbearance of the Saviour. So also the Apostle says;[fn-92-P9261_2491595:13-nf] \"Such men I delivered to Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.\" He delivered to Satan as to a torturer, with a view to their punishment, those who, before they had been delivered to him learned to blaspheme by their own will. David also draws the distinction in a few words between the faults due to his own will and the incentives of vice when he says[fn-92-P9262_2491981:14-nf] \"Cleanse thou me from my secret faults, and keep back thy servant from alien sins.\" We read also in Ecclesiastes[fn-92-P9263_2492131:15-nf] \"If the spirit of a ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place;\" from which we may clearly see that we commit sin if we give opportunity to the power which rises up, and if we fail to hurl down headlong the enemy who is scaling our walls. As to your threatening your brothers, that is, those who accuse you, with eternal fire in company with the devil, it seems to me that you do not so much drag your brethren down as raise the devil up, since he, according to you, is to be punished only with the same fires as Christian men. But you well know, I think, what eternal fires mean according to the ideas of Origen, namely, the sinners' conscience, and the remorse which galls their hearts within. These ideas he thinks are intended in the words of Isaiah:[fn-92-P9264_2492908:16-nf] \"Their worm shall not die neither shall their fire be quenched.\" And in the words addressed to Babylon:[fn-92-P9265_2493031:17-nf] \"Thou hast coals of fire, thou shalt sit upon them, these shall be thy help.\" So also in the Psalm it is said to the penitent;[fn-92-P9266_2493420:18-nf] \"What shall be given to thee, or what shall be done more for thee against thee false tongue? Sharp arrows of the mighty, with desolating coals;\" which means (according to him) that the arrows of God's precepts (concerning which the Prophet says in another place,[fn-92-P9267_2493718:19-nf] \"I lived in misery while a thorn pierces me\") should wound and strike through the crafty tongue, and make an end of sins in it. He also interprets the place where the Lord testifies saying:[fn-92-P9268_2493970:20-nf] \"I came to send fire on the earth, and how I wish that it may burn\" as meaning \"I wish that all may repent, and burn out through the Holy spirit their vices and their sins; for I am he of whom it is written,[fn-92-P9269_2494197:21-nf] \"Our God is a consuming fire;\" it is no great thing then to say this of the devil, since it is prepared also for men.\" You ought rather to have said, if you wished to avoid the suspicion of believing in the salvation of the devil;[fn-92-P9270_2494461:22-nf] \"Thou hast become perdition and shalt not be for ever;\" and as the Lord speaks to Job concerning the devil,[fn-92-P9271_2494600:23-nf] \"Behold his hope shall fail him and in the sight of all shall he be cast down. I will not arouse him as one that is cruel, for who can resist my countenance? Who has first given to me that I may return it to him? for all things beneath the heaven are mine. I will not spare him and his words that are powerful and fashioned to turn away wrath.\" Hence, these things may pass as the work of a plain man.

But perhaps some one is alarmed at hearing us discourse of the death of Him of Whom, a short while since, we said that He is everlasting with God the Father, and that He was begotten of the Father's substance, and is one with God the Father, in dominion, majesty, and eternity. But be not alarmed, O faithful hearer. Presently thou wilt see Him of Whose death thou hearest once more immortal; for the death to which He submits is about to spoil death. For the object of that mystery of the Incarnation which we expounded just now was that the divine virtue of the Son of God, as though it were a hook concealed beneath the form and fashion of human flesh (He being, as the Apostle Paul says, \"found in fashion as a man\"),[fn-97-P9718_2729926:40-nf] might lure on the Prince of this world to a conflict, to whom offering His flesh as a bait, His divinity underneath might catch him and hold him fast with its hook, through the shedding of His immaculate blood. For He alone Who knows no stain of sin hath destroyed the sins of all, of those, at least, who have marked the door-posts of their faith with His blood. As, therefore, if a fish seizes a baited hook, it not only does not take the bait off the hook, but is drawn out of the water to be itself food for others, so He Who had the power of death seized the body of Jesus in death, not being aware of the hook of Divinity inclosed within it, but having swallowed it he was caught forthwith, and the bars of hell being burst asunder, he was drawn forth as it were from the abyss to become food for others. Which result the Prophet Ezekiel long ago foretold under this same figure, saying, \"I will draw thee out with My hook, and stretch thee out upon the earth: the plains shall be filled with thee, and I will set all the fowls of the air over thee, and I will satiate all tim beasts of the earth with thee.\"[fn-97-P9719_2731059:41-nf] The Prophet David also says, \"Thou hast broken the heads of the great dragon, Thou hast given him to be meat to the people of Ethiopia.\"[fn-97-P9720_2731231:42-nf] And Job in like manner witnesses of the same mystery, for he says in the person of the Lord speaking to him, \"Wilt thou draw forth the dragon with a hook, and wilt thou put thy bit in his nostrils?\"[fn-97-P9721_2731455:43-nf] ","title":"A Commentary on the Apostles' Creed.","author":"Rufinus"},{"chapter":41,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_38_life_of_antony","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"28","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"24.

Therefore He suffered them not to speak such words, neither would He have us to suffer such, but hath charged us by His own mouth, saying, `Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheeps' clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves[fn-39-P3934_1654079:18-nf] ;' and by the mouth of His Holy Apostles, `Believe not every spirit[fn-39-P3935_1654167:19-nf] .'
