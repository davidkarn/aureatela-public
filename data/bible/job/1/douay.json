{"verses":["There was a man in the land of Hus, whose name was Job, and that\nman was simple and upright, and fearing God, and avoiding evil.","And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.","And his possession was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand\ncamels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and\na family exceedingly great:  and this man was great among all the people\nof the east.","And his sons went, and made a feast by houses, every one in his\nday.  And sending, they called their three sisters, to eat and drink\nwith them.","And when the days of their feasting were gone about, Job sent to\nthem, and sanctified them:  and rising up early, offered holocausts for\nevery one of them.  For he said:  Lest perhaps my sons have sinned, and\nhave blessed God in their hearts.  So did Job all days.","Now on a certain day, when the sons of God came to stand before\nthe Lord, Satan also was present among them.","And the Lord said to him:  Whence comest thou?  And he answered and\nsaid:  I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it.","And the Lord said to him:  Hast thou considered my servant, Job,\nthat there is none like him in the earth, a simple and upright man, and\nfearing God, and avoiding evil?","And Satan answering, said:  Doth Job fear God in vain?","Hast thou not made a fence for him, and his house, and all his\nsubstance round about, blessed the works of his hands, and his\npossession hath increased on the earth?","But stretch forth thy hand a little, and touch all that he hath,\nand see if he bless thee not to thy face.","Then the Lord said to Satan:  Behold, all that he hath is in thy\nhand:  only put not forth thy hand upon his person.  And Satan went forth\nfrom the presence of the Lord.","Now upon a certain day, when his sons and daughters were eating\nand drinking wine, in the house of their eldest brother,","There came a messenger to Job, and said:  The oxen were ploughing,\nand the asses feeding beside them,","And the Sabeans rushed in, and took all away, and slew the\nservants with the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.","And while he was yet speaking, another came, and said:  The fire\nof God fell from heaven, and striking the sheep and the servants, hath\nconsumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.","And while he also was yet speaking, there came another, and said:\nThe Chaldeans made three troops, and have fallen upon the camels, and\ntaken them; moreover, they have slain the servants with the sword:  and\nI alone have escaped to tell thee.","He was yet speaking, and behold another came in, and said:  Thy\nsons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their\neldest brother,","A violent wind came on a sudden from the side of the desert, and\nshook the four corners of the house, and it fell upon thy children, and\nthey are dead:  and I alone have escaped to tell thee.","Then Job rose up, and rent his garments, and having shaven his\nhead, fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,","And said:  Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I\nreturn thither:  the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away:  as it hath\npleased the Lord, so is it done:  blessed be the name of the Lord.","In all these things Job sinned not by his lips, nor spoke he any\nfoolish thing against God."]}
