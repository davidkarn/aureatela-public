{"verses":["And Eliphaz the Themanite, answered, and said:","Will a wise man answer as if he were speaking in the wind, and\nfill his stomach with burning heat?","Thou reprovest him by words, who is not equal to thee, and thou\nspeakest that which is not good for thee.","As much as is in thee, thou hast made void fear, and hast taken\naway prayers from before God.","For thy iniquity hath taught thy mouth, and thou imitatest the\ntongue of blasphemers.","Thy own mouth shall condemn thee, and not I:  and thy own lips\nshall answer thee.","Art thou the first man that was born, or wast thou made before\nthe hills?","Hast thou heard God's counsel, and shall his wisdom be inferior\nto thee?","What knowest thou that we are ignorant of?  what dost thou\nunderstand that we know not?","There are with us also aged and ancient men, much elder than thy\nfathers.","Is it a great matter that God should comfort thee?  but thy\nwicked words hinder this.","Why doth thy heart elevate thee, and why dost thou stare with\nthy eyes, as if they were thinking great things?","Why doth thy spirit swell against God, to utter such words out\nof thy mouth?","What is man that he should be without spot, and he that is born\nof a woman that he should appear just?","Behold among his saints none is unchangeable, and the heavens\nare not pure in his sight.","How much more is man abominable, and unprofitable, who drinketh\niniquity like water?","I will shew thee, hear me:  and I will tell thee what I have\nseen.","Wise men confess and hide not their fathers.","To whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger hath passed\namong them.","The wicked man is proud all his days, and the number of the\nyears of his tyranny is uncertain.","The sound of dread is always in his ears:  and when there is\npeace, he always suspecteth treason.","He believeth not that he may return from darkness to light,\nlooking round about for the sword on every side.","When he moveth himself to seek bread, he knoweth that the day of\ndarkness is ready at his hand.","Tribulation shall terrify him, and distress shall surround him,\nas a king that is prepared for the battle.","For he hath stretched out his hand against God, and hath\nstrengthened himself against the Almighty.","He hath run against him with his neck raised up, and is armed\nwith a fat neck.","Fatness hath covered his face, and the fat hangeth down on his\nsides.","He hath dwelt in desolate cities, and in desert houses that are\nreduced into heaps.","He shall not be enriched, neither shall his substance continue,\nneither shall he push his root in the earth.","He shall not depart out of darkness:  the flame shall dry up his\nbranches, and he shall be taken away by the breath of his own mouth.","He shall not believe, being vainly deceived by error, that he\nmay be redeemed with any price.","Before his days be full he shall perish:  and his hands shall\nwither away.","He shall be blasted as a vine when its grapes are in the first\nflower, and as an olive tree that casteth its flower.","For the congregation of the hypocrite is barren, and fire shall\ndevour their tabernacles, who love to take bribes.","He hath conceived sorrow, and hath brought forth iniquity, and\nhis womb prepareth deceits."]}
