{"verses":["The life of man upon earth is a warfare, and his days are like the\ndays of a hireling.","As a servant longeth for the shade, as the hireling looketh for\nthe end of his work;","So I also have had empty months, and have numbered to myself\nwearisome nights.","If I lie down to sleep, I shall say:  When shall I rise?  and again,\nI shall look for the evening, and shall be filled with sorrows even\ntill darkness.","My flesh is clothed with rottenness and the filth of dust; my skin\nis withered and drawn together.","My days have passed more swiftly than the web is cut by the\nweaver, and are consumed without any hope.","Remember that my life is but wind, and my eye shall not return to\nsee good things.","Nor shall the sight of man behold me:  thy eyes are upon me, and I\nshall be no more.","As a cloud is consumed, and passeth away:  so he that shall go down\nto hell shall not come up.","Nor shall he return any more into his house, neither shall his\nplace know him any more","Wherefore, I will not spare my month, I will speak in the\naffliction of my spirit:  I will talk with the bitterness of my soul.","Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou hast inclosed me in a prison?","If I say:  My bed shall comfort me, and I shall be relieved,\nspeaking with myself on my couch:","Thou wilt frighten me with dreams, and terrify me with visions.","So that my soul rather chooseth hanging, and my bones death.","I have done with hope, I shall now live no longer:  spare me, for\nmy days are nothing.","What is a man, that thou shouldst magnify him or why dost thou\nset thy heart upon him?","Thou visitest him early in the morning, and thou provest him\nsuddenly.","How long wilt thou not spare me, nor suffer me to swallow down my\nspittle?","I have sinned:  what shall I do to thee, O keeper of men?  why hast\nthou set me opposite to thee.  and am I become burdensome to myself?","Why dost thou not remove my sin, and why dost thou not take away\nmy iniquity?  Behold now I shall sleep in the dust:  and if thou seek me\nin the morning, I shall not be."]}
