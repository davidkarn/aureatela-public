For so had the prophet foretold: \"Behold, a virgin shall conceive in the womb, and bring forth a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel, which, being interpreted, is, God with us.\"[fn-35-P3544_1924120:91-nf] He did many miracles that He might commend God in Himself, some of which, even as many as seemed sufficient to proclaim Him, are contained in the evangelic Scripture. The first of these is, that He was so wonderfully born, and the last, that with His body raised up again from the dead He ascended into heaven. But the Jews who slew Him, and would not believe in Him, because it behoved Him to die and rise again, were yet more miserably wasted by the Romans, and utterly rooted out from their kingdom, where aliens had already ruled over them, and were dispersed through the lands (so that indeed there is no place where they are not), and are thus by their own Scriptures a testimony to us that we have not forged the prophecies about Christ. And very many of them, considering this, even before His passion, but chiefly after His resurrection, believed on Him, of whom it was predicted, \"Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved.\"[fn-35-P3545_1925150:92-nf] But the rest are blinded, of whom it was predicted, \"Let their table be made before them a trap, and a retribution, and a stumbling-block.

For us, indeed, those suffice which are quoted from the books of our enemies, to whom we make our acknowledgment, on account of this testimony which, in spite of themselves, they contribute by their possession of these books, while they themselves are dispersed among all nations, wherever the Church of Christ is spread abroad. For a prophecy about this thing was sent before in the Psalms, which they also read, where it is written, \"My God, His mercy shall prevent me. My God hath shown me concerning mine enemies, that Thou shalt not slay them, lest they should at last forget Thy law: disperse them in Thy might.\"[fn-35-P3547_1926387:94-nf] Therefore God has shown the Church in her enemies the Jews the grace of His compassion, since, as saith the apostle, \"their offence is the salvation of the Gentiles.\"[fn-35-P3548_1926578:95-nf] And therefore He has not slain them, that is, He has not let the knowledge that they are Jews be lost in them, although they have been conquered by the Romans, lest they should forget the law of God, and their testimony should be of no avail in this matter of which we treat. But it was not enough that he should say, \"Slay them not, lest they should at last forget Thy law,\" unless he had also added, \"Disperse them;\" because if they had only been in their own land with that testimony of the Scriptures, and not every where, certainly the Church which is everywhere could not have had them as witnesses among all nations to the prophecies which were sent before concerning Christ.","title":"Book XVIII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":22,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_114_treatise_iv_on_the_lord_s_prayer_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"32","folder":"ANF-05","text":"28.

To encourage a belief of this Gospel he has actually[fn-52-P5238_1638178:4-nf] devised for it a sort of dower,[fn-52-P5239_1638227:5-nf] in a work composed of contrary statements set in opposition, thence entitled Antitheses, and compiled with a view to such a severance of the law from the gospel as should divide the Deity into two, nay, diverse, gods-one for each Instrument, or Testament[fn-52-P5240_1638500:6-nf] as it is more usual to call it; that by such means he might also patronize[fn-52-P5241_1638600:7-nf] belief in \"the Gospel according to the Antitheses.\" These, however, I would have attacked in special combat, hand to hand; that is to say, I would have encountered singly the several devices Of the Pontic heretic, if it were not much more convenient to refute them in and with that very gospel to which they contribute their support. Although it is so easy to meet them at once with a peremptory demurrer,[fn-52-P5242_1639025:8-nf] yet, in order that I may both make them admissible in argument, and account them valid expressions of opinion, and even contend that they make for our side, that so there may be all the redder shame for the blindness of their author, we have now drawn out some antitheses of our own in opposition to Marcion.And indeed[fn-52-P5243_1639576:9-nf] I do allow that one order did run its course in the old dispensation under the Creator,[fn-52-P5244_1639680:10-nf] and that another is on its way in the new under Christ. I do not deny that there is a difference in the language of their documents, in their precepts of virtue, and in their teachings of the law; but yet all this diversity is consistent with one and the same God, even Him by whom it was arranged and also foretold. Long ago[fn-52-P5245_1640028:11-nf] did Isaiah declare that \"out of Sion should go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem\"[fn-52-P5246_1640142:12-nf] -some other law, that is, and another word. In short, says he, \"He shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; \"[fn-52-P5247_1640289:13-nf] meaning not those of the Jewish people only, but of the nations which are judged by the new law of the gospel and the new word of the apostles, and are amongst themselves rebuked of their old error as soon as they have believed. And as the result of this, \"they beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears (which are a kind of hunting instruments) into pruning-hooks; \"[fn-52-P5248_1640686:14-nf] that is to say, minds, which once were fierce and cruel, are changed by them into good dispositions productive of good fruit. And again: \"Hearken unto me, hearken unto me, my people, and ye kings, give ear unto me; for a law shall proceed from me, and my judgment for a light to the nations; \"[fn-52-P5249_1640997:15-nf] wherefore He had determined and decreed that the nations also were to be enlightened by the law and the word of the gospel. This will be that law which (according to David also) is unblameable, because \"perfect, converting the soul\"[fn-52-P5250_1641270:16-nf] from idols unto God. This likewise will be the word concerning which the same Isaiah says, \"For the Lord will make a decisive word in the land.\"[fn-52-P5251_1641432:17-nf] Because the New Testament is compendiously short,[fn-52-P5252_1641554:18-nf] and freed from the minute and perplexing[fn-52-P5253_1641614:19-nf] burdens of the law. But why enlarge, when the Creator by the same prophet foretells the renovation more manifestly and clearly than the light itself? \"Remember not the former things, neither consider the things of old\" (the old things have passed away, and new things are arising). \"Behold, I will do new things, which shall now spring forth.\"[fn-52-P5254_1641975:20-nf] So by Jeremiah: \"Break up for yourselves new pastures,[fn-52-P5255_1642055:21-nf] and sow not among thorns, and circumcise yourselves in the foreskin of your heart.\"[fn-52-P5256_1642186:22-nf] And in another passage: \"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Jacob, and with the house of Judah; not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I arrested their dispensation, in order to bring them out of the land of Egypt.\"[fn-52-P5257_1642532:23-nf] He thus shows that the ancient covenant is temporary only, when He indicates its change; also when He promises that it shall be followed by an eternal one. For by Isaiah He says: \"Hear me, and ye shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you,\" adding \"the sure mercies of David,\"[fn-52-P5258_1642871:24-nf] in order that He might show that that covenant was to run its course in Christ. That He was of the family of David, according to the genealogy of Mary,[fn-52-P5259_1643040:25-nf] He declared in a figurative way even by the rod which was to proceed out of the stem of Jesse.[fn-52-P5260_1643581:26-nf] Forasmuch then as he said, that from the Creator there would come other laws, and other words, and new dispensations of covenants, indicating also that the very sacrifices were to receive higher offices, and that amongst all nations, by Malachi when he says: \"I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord, neither will I accept your sacrifices at your hands. For from the rising of the sun, even unto the going down of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place a sacrifice is offered unto my name, even a pure offering\"[fn-52-P5261_1644145:27-nf] -meaning simple prayer from a pure conscience,-it is of necessity that every change which comes as the result of innovation, introduces a diversity in those things of which the change is made, from which diversity arises also a contrariety. For as there is nothing, after it has undergone a change, which does not become different, so there is nothing different which is not contrary.[fn-52-P5262_1644551:28-nf] Of that very thing, therefore, there will be predicated a contrariety in consequence of its diversity, to which there accrued a change of condition after an innovation. He who brought about the change, the same instituted the diversity also; He who foretold the innovation, the same announced beforehand the contrariety likewise. Why, in your interpretation, do you impute a difference in the state of things to a difference of powers? Why do you wrest to the Creator's prejudice those examples from which you draw your antitheses, when you may recognise them all in His sensations and affections? \"I will wound,\" He says, \"and I will heal; \"\"I will kill,\" He says again, \"and I will make alive\"[fn-52-P5263_1645272:29-nf] -even the same \"who createth evil and maketh peace; \"[fn-52-P5264_1645349:30-nf] from which you are used even to censure Him with the imputation of fickleness and inconstancy, as if He forbade what He commanded, and commanded what He forbade. Why, then, have you not reckoned up the Antitheses also which occur in the natural works of the Creator, who is for ever contrary to Himself? You have not been able, unless I am misinformed, to recognise the fact,[fn-52-P5265_1645743:31-nf] that the world, at all events,[fn-52-P5266_1645791:32-nf] even amongst your people of Pontus, is made up of a diversity of elements which are hostile to one another.[fn-52-P5267_1645912:33-nf] It was therefore your bounden duty first to have determined that the god of the light was one being, and the god of darkness was another, in such wise that you might have been able to have distinctly asserted one of them to be the god of the law and the other the god of the gospel. It is, however, the settled conviction already[fn-52-P5268_1646266:34-nf] of my mind from manifest proofs, that, as His works and plans[fn-52-P5269_1646352:35-nf] exist in the way of Antitheses, so also by the same rule exist the mysteries of His religion.[fn-52-P5270_1646474:36-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":10,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"77","folder":"ANF-03","text":"In the psalm he exclaims: \"Defend the fatherless and the needy; do justice to the humble and the poor; deliver the poor, and rid the needy out of the hand of the wicked.\"[fn-57-P5738_1745795:461-nf] Similarly in the seventy-first Psalm: \"In righteousness shall He judge the needy amongst the people, and shall save the children of the poor.\"[fn-57-P5739_1745964:462-nf] And in the following words he says of Christ: \"All nations shall serve Him.\"[fn-57-P5740_1746062:463-nf] Now David only reigned over the Jewish nation, so that nobody can suppose that this was spoken of David; whereas He had taken upon Himself the condition of the poor, and such as were oppressed with want, \"Because He should deliver the needy out of the hand of the mighty man; He shall spare the needy and the poor, and shall deliver the souls of the poor.

And likewise earlier, in the book of Kings,[fn-57-P5744_1747154:467-nf] Hannah the mother of Samuel gives glory to God in these words: \"He raiseth the poor man from the ground, and the beggar, that He may set him amongst the princes of His people (that is, in His own kingdom), and on thrones of glory\" (even royal ones).[fn-57-P5745_1747472:468-nf] And by Isaiah how He inveighs against the oppressors of the needy \"What mean ye that ye set fire to my vineyard, and that the spoil of the poor is in your houses?

For even if you suppose that the promises of the Creator were earthly, but that Christ's are heavenly, it is quite clear that heaven has been as yet the property of no other God whatever, than Him who owns the earth also; quite clear that the Creator has given even the lesser promises (of earthly blessing), in order that I may more readily believe Him concerning His greater promises (of heavenly blessings) also, than (Marcion's god), who has never given proof of his liberality by any preceding bestowal of minor blessings. \"Blessed are they that hunger, for they shall be filled.\"[fn-57-P5752_1749273:475-nf] I might connect this clause with the former one, because none but the poor and needy suffer hunger, if the Creator had not specially designed that the promise of a similar blessing should serve as a preparation for the gospel, that so men might know it to be His.[fn-57-P5753_1749557:476-nf] For thus does He say, by Isaiah, concerning those whom He was about to call from the ends of the earth-that is, the Gentiles: \"Behold, they shall come swiftly with speed: \"[fn-57-P5754_1749779:477-nf] swiftly, because hastening towards the fulness of the times; with speed, because unclogged by the weights of the ancient law.

And again He says: \"Behold, my servants shall be filled, but ye shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty.\"[fn-57-P5755_1750199:478-nf] As for these oppositions, we shall see whether they are not premonitors of Christ.[fn-57-P5756_1750303:479-nf] Meanwhile the promise of fulness to the hungry is a provision of God the Creator. \"Blessed are they that weep, for they shall laugh.\"[fn-57-P5757_1750473:480-nf] Turn again to the passage of Isaiah: \"Behold, my servants shall exult with joy, but ye shall be ashamed; behold, my servants shall be glad, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart.\"[fn-57-P5758_1750672:481-nf] And recognise these oppositions also in the dispensation of Christ. Surely gladness and joyous exultation is promised to those who are in an opposite condition-to the sorrowful, and sad, and anxious. Just as it is said in the 125th Psalm: \"They who sow in tears shall reap in joy.\"[fn-57-P5759_1750979:482-nf] Moreover, laughter is as much an accessory to the exulting and glad, as weeping is to the sorrowful and grieving. Therefore the Creator, in foretelling matters for laughter and tears, was the first who said that those who mourned should laugh. Accordingly, He who began (His course) with consolation for the poor, and the humble, and the hungry, and the weeping, was at once eager[fn-57-P5760_1751437:483-nf] to represent Himself as Him whom He had pointed out by the mouth of Isaiah: \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the poor.\"[fn-57-P5761_1751633:484-nf] \"Blessed are the needy, because theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\"[fn-57-P5762_1751719:485-nf] \"He hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted.\"[fn-57-P5763_1751788:486-nf] \"Blessed are they that hunger, for they shall be filled.\"[fn-57-P5764_1751866:487-nf] \"To comfort all that mourn.\"[fn-57-P5765_1751915:488-nf] \"Blessed are they that weep, for they shall laugh.\"[fn-57-P5766_1751987:489-nf] \"To give unto them that mourn in Sion, beauty (or glory) for ashes, and the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.\"[fn-57-P5767_1752164:490-nf] Now since Christ, as soon as He entered on His course,[fn-57-P5768_1752239:491-nf] fulfilled such a ministration as this, He is either, Himself, He who predicted His own coming to do all this; or else if he is not yet come who predicted this, the charge to Marcion's Christ must be a ridiculous one (although I should perhaps add a necessary[fn-57-P5769_1752522:492-nf] one), which bade him say, \"Blessed shall ye be, when men shall bate you, and shall reproach you, and shall cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.\"[fn-57-P5770_1752754:493-nf] In this declaration there is, no doubt, an exhortation to patience. Well, what did the Creator say otherwise by Isaiah? \"Fear ye not the reproach of men, nor be diminished by their contempt.\"[fn-57-P5771_1752966:494-nf] What reproach? what contempt? That which was to be incurred for the sake of the Son of man. What Son of man? He who (is come) according to the Creator's will. Whence shall we get our proof? From the very cutting off, which was predicted against Him; as when He says by Isaiah to the Jews, who were the instigators of hatred against Him: \"Because of you, my name is blasphemed amongst the Gentiles; \"[fn-57-P5772_1753400:495-nf] and in another passage: \"Lay the penalty on[fn-57-P5773_1753464:496-nf] Him who surrenders[fn-57-P5774_1753499:497-nf] His own life, who is held in contempt by the Gentiles, whether servants or magistrates.\"[fn-57-P5775_1753610:498-nf] Now, since hatred was predicted against that Son of man who has His mission from the Creator, whilst the Gospel testifies that the name of Christians, as derived from Christ, was to be hated for the Son of man's sake, because He is Christ, it determines the point that that was the Son of man in the matter of hatred who came according to the Creator's purpose, and against whom the hatred was predicted. And even if He had not yet come, the hatred of His name which exists at the present day could not in any case have possibly preceded Him who was to bear the name.[fn-57-P5776_1754316:499-nf] But He has both suffered the penalty[fn-57-P5777_1754378:500-nf] in out presence, and surrendered His life, laying it down for our sakes, and is held in contempt by the Gentiles. And He who was born (into the world) will be that very Son of man on whose account our name also is rejected.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":10,"verse":33,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"79","folder":"ANF-03","text":"\"In the like manner,\" says He,[fn-57-P5781_1754811:501-nf] \"did their fathers unto the prophets.\" What a turncoat[fn-57-P5782_1754886:502-nf] is Marcion's Christ! Now the destroyer, now the advocate of the prophets! He destroyed them as their rival, by converting their disciples; he took up their cause as their friend, by stigmatizing[fn-57-P5783_1755146:503-nf] their persecutors. But,[fn-57-P5784_1755189:504-nf] in as far as the defence of the prophets could not be consistent in the Christ of Marcion, who came to destroy them; in so far is it becoming to the Creator's Christ that He should stigmatize those who persecuted the prophets, for He in all things accomplished their predictions. Again, it is more characteristic of the Creator to upbraid sons with their fathers' sins, than it is of that god who chastizes no man for even his own misdeeds. But you will say, He cannot be regarded as defending the prophets simply because He wished to affirm the iniquity of the Jews for their impious dealings with their own prophets. Well, then, in this case,[fn-57-P5785_1755848:505-nf] no sin ought to have been charged against the Jews: they were rather deserving of praise and approbation when they maltreated[fn-57-P5786_1755986:506-nf] those whom the absolutely good god of Marcion, after so long a time, bestirred himself[fn-57-P5787_1756162:507-nf] to destroy. I suppose, however, that by this time he bad ceased to be the absolutely good god;[fn-57-P5788_1756275:508-nf] he had now sojourned a considerable while even with the Creator, and was no longer (like) the god of Epicurus[fn-57-P5789_1756406:509-nf] purely and simply. For see how he condescends[fn-57-P5790_1756520:510-nf] to curse, and proves himself capable of taking offence and feeling anger! He actually pronounces a woe! But a doubt is raised against us as to the import of this word, as if it carried with it less the sense of a curse than of an admonition. Where, however, is the difference, since even an admonition is not given without the sting of a threat, especially when it is embittered with a woe? Moreover, both admonition and threatening will be the resources of him[fn-57-P5791_1756998:511-nf] who knows how to feel angry, For no one will forbid the doing of a thing with an admonition or a threat, except him who will inflict punishment for the doing of it. No one would inflict punishment, except him who was susceptible of anger. Others, again, admit that the word implies a curse; but they will have it that Christ pronounced the woe, not as if it were His own genuine feeling, but because the woe is from the Creator, and He wanted to set forth to them the severity of the Creator in order that He might the more commend His own long-suffering[fn-57-P5792_1757572:512-nf] in His beatitudes Just as if it were not competent to the Creator, in the pre-eminence of both His attributes as the good God and Judge, that, as He had made clemency[fn-57-P5793_1757760:513-nf] the preamble of His benediction so He should place severity in the sequel of His curses; thus fully developing His discipline in both directions, both in following out the blessing and in providing against the curse.[fn-57-P5794_1757998:514-nf] He had already said of old, \"Behold, I have set before you blessing and cursing.\"[fn-57-P5795_1758118:515-nf] Which statement was really a presage of[fn-57-P5796_1758180:516-nf] this temper of the gospel. Besides, what sort of being is that who, to insinuate a belief in his own goodness, invidiously contrasted[fn-57-P5797_1758337:517-nf] with it the Creator's severity? Of little worth is the recommendation which has for its prop the defamation of another. And yet by thus setting forth the severity of the Creator, he, in fact, affirmed Him to be an object of fear.[fn-57-P5798_1758584:518-nf] Now if He be an object of fear, He is of course more worthy of being obeyed than slighted; and thus Marcion's Christ begins to teach favourably to the Creator's interests.[fn-57-P5799_1758773:519-nf] Then, on the admission above mentioned, since the woe which has regard to the rich is the Creator's, it follows that it is not Christ, but the Creator, who is angry with the rich; while Christ approves of[fn-58-P5800_1759002:520-nf] the incentives of the rich[fn-58-P5801_1759049:521-nf] -I mean, their pride, their pomp,[fn-58-P5802_1759106:522-nf] their love of the world, and their contempt of God, owing to which they deserve the woe of the Creator. But how happens it that the reprobation of the rich does not proceed from the same God who had just before expressed approbation of the poor? There is nobody but reprobates the opposite of that which he has approved. If, therefore, there be imputed to the Creator the woe pronounced against the rich, there must be claimed for Him also the promise of the blessing upon the poor; and thus the entire work of the Creator devolves on Christ.-If to Marcion's god there be ascribed the blessing of the poor, he must also have imputed to him the malediction of the rich; and thus will he become the Creator's equal,[fn-58-P5803_1759836:523-nf] both good and judicial; nor will there be left any room for that distinction whereby two gods are made; and when this distinction is removed, there will remain the verity which pronounces the Creator to be the one only God. Since, therefore, \"woe\" is a word indicative of malediction, or of some unusually austere[fn-58-P5804_1760177:524-nf] exclamation; and since it is by Christ uttered against the rich, I shall have to show that the Creator is also a despiser[fn-58-P5805_1760319:525-nf] of the rich, as I have shown Him to be the defender[fn-58-P5806_1760392:526-nf] of the poor, in order that I may prove Christ to be on the Creator's side in this matter, even when He enriched Solomon.[fn-58-P5807_1760533:527-nf] But with respect to this man, since, when a choice was left to him, he preferred asking for what he knew to be well-pleasing to God-even wisdom-he further merited the attainment of the riches, which he did not prefer. The endowing of a man indeed with riches, is not an incongruity to God, for by the help of riches even rich men are comforted and assisted; moreover, by them many a work of justice and charity is carried out. But yet there are serious faults[fn-58-P5808_1761019:528-nf] which accompany riches; and it is because of these that woes are denounced on the rich, even in the Gospel. \"Ye have received,\" says He, \"your consolation; \"[fn-58-P5809_1761191:529-nf] that is, of course, from their riches, in the pomps and vanities of the world which these purchase for them. Accordingly, in Deuteronomy, Moses says: \"Lest, when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, as well as thy silver and thy gold, thine heart be then lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God.\"[fn-58-P5810_1761634:530-nf] in similar terms, when king Hezekiah became proud of his treasures, and gloried in them rather than in God before those who had come on an embassy from Babylon,[fn-58-P5811_1761821:531-nf] (the Creator) breaks forth[fn-58-P5812_1761884:532-nf] against him by the mouth of Isaiah: \"Behold, the days come when all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store, shall be carried to Babylon.\"[fn-58-P5813_1762072:533-nf] So by Jeremiah likewise did He say: \"Let not the rich man glory in his riches but let him that glorieth even glory in the Lord.\"[fn-58-P5814_1762223:534-nf] Similarly against the daughters of Sion does He inveigh by Isaiah, when they were haughty through their pomp and the abundance of their riches,[fn-58-P5815_1762391:535-nf] just as in another passage He utters His threats against the proud and noble: \"Hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth, and down to it shall descend the illustrious, and the great, and the rich (this shall be Christ's `woe to the rich'); and man[fn-58-P5816_1762670:536-nf] shall be humbled,\" even he that exalts himself with riches; \"and the mighty man[fn-58-P5817_1762784:537-nf] shall be dishonoured,\" even he who is mighty from his wealth.[fn-58-P5818_1762858:538-nf] Concerning whom He says again: \"Behold, the Lord of hosts shall confound the pompous together with their strength: those that are lifted up shall be hewn down, and such as are lofty shall fall by the sword.\"[fn-58-P5819_1763085:539-nf] And who are these but the rich? Because they have indeed received their consolation, glory, and honour and a lofty position from their wealth. In Psalms 48 He also turns off our care from these and says: \"Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, and when his glory is increased: for when he shall die, he shall carry nothing away; nor shall his glory descend along with him.\"[fn-58-P5820_1763481:540-nf] So also in Psalms 61: \"Do not desire riches; and if they do yield you their lustre,[fn-58-P5821_1763590:541-nf] do not set your heart upon them.\"[fn-58-P5822_1763641:542-nf] Lastly, this very same woe is pronounced of old by Amos against the rich, who also abounded in delights. \"Woe unto them,\" says he, \"who sleep upon beds of ivory, and deliciously stretch themselves upon their couches; who eat the kids from the flocks of the goats, and sucking calves from the flocks of the heifers, while they chant to the sound of the viol; as if they thought they should continue long, and were not fleeting; who drink their refined wines, and anoint themselves with the costliest ointments.\"[fn-58-P5823_1764173:543-nf] Therefore, even if I could do nothing else than show that the Creator dissuades men from riches, without at the same time first condemning the rich, in the very same terms in which Christ also did, no one could doubt that, from the same authority, there was added a commination against the rich in that woe of Christ, from whom also had first proceeded the dissuasion against the material sin of these persons, that is, their riches. For such commination is the necessary sequel to such a dissuasive. He inflicts a woe also on \"the full, because they shall hunger; on those too which laugh now, because they shall mourn.\"[fn-58-P5824_1764816:544-nf] To these will correspond these opposites which occur, as we have seen above, in the benedictions of the Creator: \"Behold, my servants shall be full, but ye shall be hungry \"-even because ye have been filled; \"behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed\"[fn-58-P5825_1765105:545-nf] -even ye who shall mourn, who now are laughing. For as it is written in the psalm, \"They who sow in tears shall reap in joy,\"[fn-58-P5826_1765252:546-nf] so does it run in the Gospel: They who sow in laughter, that is, in joy, shall reap in tears. These principles did the Creator lay down of old; and Christ has renewed them, by simply bringing them into prominent view,[fn-58-P5827_1765491:547-nf] not by making any change in them. \"Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.\"[fn-58-P5828_1765648:548-nf] With equal stress does the Creator, by His prophet Isaiah, censure those who seek after human flattery and praise: \"O my people, they who call you happy mislead you, and disturb the paths of your feet.\"[fn-58-P5829_1765871:549-nf] In another passage He forbids all implicit trust in man, and likewise in the applause of man; as by the prophet Jeremiah: \"Cursed be the man that trusteth in man.\"[fn-58-P5830_1766056:550-nf] Whereas in Psalms 117 it is said: \"It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man; it is better to trust in the Lord than to place hope in princes.\"[fn-58-P5831_1766243:551-nf] Thus everything which is caught at by men is adjured by the Creator, down to their good words.[fn-58-P5832_1766364:552-nf] It is as much His property to condemn the praise and flattering words bestowed on the false prophets by their fathers, as to condemn their vexatious and persecuting treatment of the (true) prophets. As the injuries suffered by the prophets could not be imputed[fn-58-P5833_1766653:553-nf] to their own God, so the applause bestowed on the false prophets could not have been displeasing to any other god but the God of the true prophets.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":10,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"125","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In the forty-fourth Psalm: \"My heart hath breathed out a good Word.

Now the species is not always overstepped, for things are often said of such a kind as evidently apply to it also, or perhaps even to it exclusively. But when Scripture, having up to a certain point been speaking about the species, makes a transition at that point from the species to the genus, the reader must then be carefully on his guard against seeking in the species what he can find much better and more surely in the genus. Take, for example, what the prophet Ezekiel says: \"When the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their own way, and by their doings: their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman. Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it: and I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way, and according to their doings, I judged them.\"[fn-52-P5243_2783897:78-nf] Now it is easy to understand that this applies to that house of Israel of which the apostle says, \"Behold Israel after the flesh;\"[fn-52-P5244_2784053:79-nf] because the people of Israel after the flesh did both perform and endure all that is here referred to. What immediately follows, too, may be understood as applying to the same people. But when the prophet begins to say, \"And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord,\"[fn-52-P5245_2784459:80-nf] the reader ought now carefully to observe the way in which the species is overstepped and the genus taken in. For he goes on to say: \"And I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes. For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land. Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh. And I will put y Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my commandments, and do them. And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. I will also save you from all your uncleannesses.\"[fn-52-P5246_2785375:81-nf] Now that this is a prophecy of the New Testament, to which pertain not only the remnant of that one nation of which it is elsewhere said, \"For though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall be saved,\"[fn-52-P5247_2785653:82-nf] but also the other nations which were promised to their fathers and our fathers; and that there is here a promise of that washing of regeneration which, as we see, is now imparted to all nations, no one who looks into the matter can doubt. And that saying of the apostle, when he is commending the grace of the New Testament and its excellence in comparison with the Old, \"Ye are our epistle . . . written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart,\"[fn-52-P5248_2786189:83-nf] has an evident reference to this place where the prophet says, \"A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.\"[fn-52-P5249_2786446:84-nf] Now the heart of flesh from which the apostle's expression, \"the fleshy tables of the heart,\" is drawn, the prophet intended to point out as distinguished from the stony heart by the possession of sentient life; and by sentient he understood intelligent life.

But He was thus learning (or rehearsing), in order to level for us the way of faith, that we might the more readily believe that the Son of God had come down into the world, if we knew that in times past also something similar had been done.[fn-106-P10624_2984308:199-nf] For as it was on our account and for our learning that these events are described in the Scriptures, so for our sakes also were they done-(even ours, I say), \"upon whom the ends of the world are come.\"[fn-106-P10625_2984562:200-nf] In this way it was that even then He knew full well what human feelings and affections were, intending as He always did to take upon Him man's actual component substances, body and soul, making inquiry of Adam (as if He were ignorant),[fn-106-P10626_2984825:201-nf] \"Where art thou, Adam? \"[fn-106-P10627_2984907:202-nf] -repenting that He had made man, as if He had lacked foresight;[fn-106-P10628_2984991:203-nf] tempting Abraham, as if ignorant of what was in man; offended with persons, and then reconciled to them; and whatever other (weaknesses and imperfections) the heretics lay hold of (in their assumptions) as unworthy of God, in order to discredit the Creator, not considering that these circumstances are suitable enough for the Son, who was one day to experience even human sufferings-hunger and thirst, and tears, and actual birth and real death, and in respect of such a dispensation \"made by the Father a little less than the angels.\"[fn-106-P10629_2985547:204-nf] But the heretics, you may be sure, will not allow that those things are suitable even to the Son of God, which you are imputing to the very Father Himself, when you pretend[fn-106-P10630_2985740:205-nf] that He made Himself less (than the angels) on our account; whereas the Scripture informs us that He who was made less was so affected by another, and not Himself by Himself. What, again, if He was One who was \"crowned with glory and honour,\" and He Another by whom He was so crowned,[fn-106-P10631_2986039:206-nf] -the Son, in fact, by the Father? Moreover, how comes it to pass, that the Almighty Invisible God, \"whom no man hath seen nor can see; He who dwelleth in light unapproachable; \"[fn-106-P10632_2986237:207-nf] \"He who dwelleth not in temples made with hands; \"[fn-106-P10633_2986310:208-nf] \"from before whose sight the earth trembles, and the mountains melt like wax; \"[fn-106-P10634_2986412:209-nf] who holdeth the whole world in His hand \"like a nest; \"[fn-106-P10635_2986501:210-nf] \"whose throne is heaven, and earth His footstool; \"[fn-106-P10636_2986572:211-nf] in whom is every place, but Himself is in no place; who is the utmost bound of the universe;-how happens it, I say, that He (who, though) the Most High, should yet have walked in paradise towards the cool of the evening, in quest of Adam; and should have shut up the ark after Noah had entered it; and at Abraham's tent should have refreshed Himself under an oak; and have called to Moses out of the burning bush; and have appeared as \"the fourth\" in the furnace of the Babylonian monarch (although He is there called the Son of man),-unless all these events had happened as an image, as a mirror, as an enigma (of the future incarnation)? Surely even these things could not have been believed even of the Son of God, unless they had been given us in the Scriptures; possibly also they could not have been believed of the Father, even if they had been given in the Scriptures, since these men bring Him down into Mary's womb, and set Him before Pilate's judgment-seat, and bury Him in the sepulchre of Joseph. Hence, therefore, their error becomes manifest; for, being ignorant that the entire order of the divine administration has from the very first had its course through the agency of the Son, they believe that the Father Himself was actually seen, and held converse with men. and worked, and was athirst, and suffered hunger (in spite of the prophet who says: \"The everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, shall never thirst at all, nor be hungry; \"[fn-106-P10637_2988074:212-nf] much more, shall neither die at any time, nor be buried!), and therefore that it was uniformly one God, even the Father, who at all times did Himself the things which were really done by Him through the agency of the Son.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":10,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_46_book_ii_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"80","folder":"ANF-04","text":"6. There are also many other things which escape our notice, and are known to Him alone who is the physician of our souls. For if, on account of those bad effects which we bring upon ourselves by eating and drinking, we deem it necessary for the health of the body to make use of some unpleasant and painful drug, sometimes even, if the nature of the disease demand, requiring the severe process of the amputating knife; and if the virulence of the disease shall transcend even these remedies, the evil has at last to be burned out by fire; how much more is it to be understood that God our Physician, desiring to remove the defects of our souls, which they had contracted from their different sins and crimes, should employ penal measures of this sort, and should apply even, in addition, the punishment of fire to those who have lost their soundness of mind! Pictures of this method of procedure are found also in the holy Scriptures. In the book of Deuteronomy, the divine word threatens sinners with the punishments of fevers, and colds, and jaundice,[fn-67-P6722_1394128:179-nf] and with the pains of feebleness of vision, and alienation of mind and paralysis, and blindness, and weakness of the reins. If any one, then, at his leisure gather together out of the whole of Scripture all the enumerations of diseases which in the threatenings addressed to sinners are called by the names of bodily maladies, he will find that either the vices of souls, or their punishments, are figuratively indicated by them. To understand now, that in the same way in which physicians apply remedies to the sick, in order that by careful treatment they may recover their health, God so deals towards those who have lapsed and fallen into sin, is proved by this, that the cup of God's fury is ordered, through the agency of the prophet Jeremiah,[fn-67-P6723_1394921:180-nf] to be offered to all nations, that they may drink it, and be in a state of madness, and vomit it forth. In doing which, He threatens them, saying, That if any one refuse to drink, he shall not be cleansed.[fn-67-P6724_1395156:181-nf] By which certainly it is understood that the fury of God's vengeance is profitable for the purgation of souls. That the punishment, also, which is said to be applied by fire, is understood to be applied with the object of healing, is taught by Isaiah, who speaks thus of Israel: \"The Lord will wash away the filth of the sons or daughters of Zion, and shall purge away the blood from the midst of them by the spirit of judgment, and the spirit of burning.\"[fn-67-P6725_1395642:182-nf] Of the Chaldeans he thus speaks: \"Thou hast the coals of fire; sit upon them: they will be to thee a help.\"[fn-67-P6726_1395769:183-nf] And in other passages he says, \"The Lord will sanctify in a burning fire\"[fn-67-P6727_1395913:184-nf] and in the prophecies of Malachi he says, \"The Lord sitting will blow, and purify, and will pour forth the cleansed sons of Judah.\"[fn-67-P6728_1396078:185-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":10,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_48_book_iv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"ANF-04","text":"33. And, in the first place, it is to be noted that we have nowhere found in the canonical Scriptures,[fn-73-P7394_1696592:50-nf] up to the present time, the word \"matter\" used for that substance which is said to underlie bodies. For in the expression of Isaiah, \"And he shall devour u\\ #lh,\" i.e., matter, \"like hay,\"[fn-73-P7395_1696811:51-nf] when speaking of those who were appointed to undergo their punishments, the word \"matter\" was used instead of \"sins.\" And if this word \"matter\" should happen to occur in any other passage, it will never be found, in my opinion, to have the signification of which we are now in quest, unless perhaps in the book which is called the Wisdom of Solomon, a work which is certainly not esteemed authoritative by all.[fn-73-P7396_1697319:52-nf] In that book, however, we find written as follows: \"For thy almighty hand, that made the world out of shapeless matter, wanted not means to send among them a multitude of bears and fierce lions.\"[fn-73-P7397_1697538:53-nf] Very many, indeed, are of opinion that the matter of which things are made is itself signified in the language used by Moses in the beginning of Genesis: \"In the beginning God made heaven and earth; and the earth was invisible, and not arranged: \"[fn-73-P7398_1697805:54-nf] for by the words \"invisible and not arranged\" Moses would seem to mean nothing else than shapeless matter. But if this be truly matter, it is clear then that the original elements of bodies[fn-73-P7399_1698066:55-nf] are not incapable of change. For those who posited \"atoms\"-either those particles which are incapable of subdivision, or those which are subdivided into equal parts-or any one element, as the principles of bodily things, could not posit the word \"matter\" in the proper sense of the term among the first principles of things. For if they will have it that matter underlies every body-a substance convertible or changeable, or divisible in all its parts-they will not, as is proper, assert that it exists without qualities. And with them we agree, for we altogether deny that matter ought to be spoken of as \"unbegotten\" or \"uncreated,\" agreeably to our former statements, when we pointed out that from water, and earth, and air or heat, different kinds of fruits were produced by different kinds of trees; or when we showed that fire, and air, and water, and earth were alternately converted into each other, and that one element was resolved into another by a kind of mutual consanguinity; and also when we proved that from the food either of men or animals the substance of the flesh was derived, or that the moisture of the natural seed was converted into solid flesh and bones;-all which go to prove that the substance of the body is changeable, and may pass from one quality into all others.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":10,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_38_letter_of_an_inquirer_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"30","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"§4.

Thus he suggested evil to the wife of Job, persuading her to feign affection for her husband, while he taught her to blaspheme God. Thus does the crafty spirit mock men by false displays, deluding and drawing each into his own pit of wickedness. When of old he deceived the first man Adam, thinking that through him he should have all men subject unto him, he exulted with great boldness and said, `My hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people; and as one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all the earth; and there is none that shall escape me or speak against me[fn-39-P3921_1651019:6-nf] .'
