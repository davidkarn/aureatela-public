Isaiah tells of the mystery of our faith and hope:[fn-63-P6388_1964354:224-nf] \"Behold a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Emmanuel.\" I know that the Jews are accustomed to meet us with the objection that in Hebrew the word Almahdq does not mean a virgin, but a young woman. And, to speak truth, a virgin is properly called Bethulah, but a young woman, or a girl, is not Almah, but Naarah![fn-63-P6389_1964714:225-nf] What then is the meaning of Almah? A hidden virgin, that is, not merely virgin, but a virgin and something more, because not every virgin is hidden, shut off from the occasional sight of men. Then again, Rebecca, on account of her extreme purity, and because she was a type of the Church which she represented in her own virginity, is described in Genesis as Almah, not Bethulah, as may clearly be proved from the words of Abraham's servant, spoken by him in Mesopotamia:[fn-63-P6390_1965468:226-nf] \"And he said, O Lord, the God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go: behold I stand by the fountain of water; and let it come to pass, that the maiden which cometh forth to draw, to whom I shall say, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of this pitcher to drink; and she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the Lord hath appointed for my master's son.\" Where he speaks of the maiden coming forth to draw water, the Hebrew word is Almah, that is, a virgin secluded, and guarded by her parents with extreme care. Or, if if this be not so, let them at least show me where the word is applied to married women as well, and I will confess my ignorance. \"Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son.\" If virginity be not preferred to marriage, why did not the Holy Spirit choose a married woman, or a widow? For at that time Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser, was alive, distinguished for purity, and always free to devote herself to prayers and fasting in the temple of God. If the life, and good works, and fasting without virginity can merit the advent of the Holy Spirit, she might well have been the mother of our Lord. Let us hasten to the rest:[fn-63-P6391_1966749:227-nf] \"The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn.\" To her whom he called daughter the prophet also gave the title virgin, for fear that if he spoke only of a daughter, it might be supposed that she was married. This is the virgin daughter whom elsewhere he thus addresses:[fn-63-P6392_1967070:228-nf] \"Sing, O barren, thou that dost not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate, than the children of the married wife, saith the Lord.\" This is she of whom God by the mouth of Jeremiah speaks, saying:[fn-63-P6393_1967376:229-nf] \"Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire.\" Concerning her we read of a great miracle in the same prophecy[fn-63-P6394_1967519:230-nf] -that a woman should compass a man, and that the Father of all things should be contained in a virgin's womb.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":37,"verse":29,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_23_letters_of_the_blessed_theodoret_bishop_of_cyrus","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"611","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"I really am sorry for the poor fellow.

His idea was, so it is said, to throw the imperial city into confusion by attacking true doctrines a second time, and to charge your holiness with supporting them.

For with respect to the patriarch it is said, \"I remembered my covenant with Abraham;\"[fn-27-P2739_910922:51-nf] but here He saith not \"the covenant,\" but how? \"I will defend this city for my servant David's sake.\"[fn-27-P2740_911045:52-nf] And besides, on account of His favor towards him, He suffered not Solomon to fall from the kingdom. great as the sin was which he had committed.

For they could be presented more diffusely and continued in a more expanded disputation, since the whole of the Old and New Testaments might be adduced in testimony that thus the true faith stands. But because heretics, ever struggling against the truth, are accustomed to prolong the controversy of pure tradition and Catholic faith, being offended against Christ; because He is, moreover, asserted to be God by the Scriptures also, and this is believed to be so by us; we must rightly-that every heretical calumny may be removed from our faith-contend, concerning the fact that Christ is God also, in such a way as that it may not militate against the truth of Scripture; nor yet against our faith, how there is declared to be one God by the Scriptures, and how it is held and believed by us. For as well they who say that Jesus Christ Himself is God the Father, as moreover they who would have Him to be only man, have gathered thence[fn-104-P10447_3290705:266-nf] the sources and reasons of their error and perversity; because when they perceived that it was written[fn-104-P10448_3290837:267-nf] that \"God is one,\" they thought that they could not otherwise hold such an opinion than by supposing that it must be believed either that Christ was man only, or really God the Father. And they were accustomed in such a way to connect their sophistries as to endeavour to justify their own error. And thus they who say that Jesus Christ is the Father argue as follows:-If God is one, and Christ is God, Christ is the Father, since God is one. If Christ be not the Father, because Christ is God the Son, there appear to be two Gods introduced, contrary to the Scriptures. And they who contend that Christ is man only, conclude on the other hand thus:-If the Father is one, and the Son another, but the Father is God and Christ is God, then there is not one God, but two Gods are at once introduced, the Father and the Son; and if God is one, by consequence Christ must be a man, so that rightly the Father may be one God. Thus indeed the Lord is, as it were, crucified between two thieves,[fn-104-P10449_3291864:268-nf] even as He was formerly placed; and thus from either side He receives the sacrilegious reproaches of such heretics as these. But neither the Holy Scriptures nor we suggest to them the reasons of their perdition and blindness, if they either will not, or cannot, see what is evidently written in the midst of the divine documents. For we both know, and read, and believe, and maintain that God is one, who made the heaven as well as the earth, since we neither know any other, nor shall we at any time know such, seeing that there is none. \"I,\" says He, \"am God, and there is none beside me, righteous and a Saviour.\"[fn-104-P10450_3292598:269-nf] And in another place: \"I am the first and the last, and beside me there is no God who is as I.\"[fn-104-P10451_3292718:270-nf] And, \"Who hath meted out heaven with a Span, and the earth with a handful? Who has suspended the mountains in a balance, and the woods on scales? \"[fn-104-P10452_3292890:271-nf] And Hezekiah: \"That all may know that Thou art God alone.\"[fn-104-P10453_3292970:272-nf] Moreover, the Lord Himself: \"Why askest thou me concerning that which is good? God alone is good.\"[fn-104-P10454_3293094:273-nf] Moreover, the Apostle Paul says: \"Who only hath immortality, and dwelleth in the light that no man can approach unto, whom no man hath seen, nor can see.\"[fn-104-P10455_3293272:274-nf] And in another place: \"But a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.\"[fn-104-P10456_3293376:275-nf] But even as we hold, and read, and believe this, thus we ought to pass over no portion of the heavenly Scriptures, since indeed also we ought by no means to reject those marks of Christ's divinity which are laid down in the Scriptures, that we may not, by corrupting the authority of the Scriptures, be held to have corrupted the integrity of our holy faith. And let us therefore believe this, since it is most faithful that Jesus Christ the Son of God is our Lord and God; because \"in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. The same was in the beginning with God.\"[fn-104-P10457_3294002:276-nf] And, \"The Word was made flesh, and dwelt in us.\"[fn-104-P10458_3294072:277-nf] And, \"My Lord and my God.\"[fn-104-P10459_3294119:278-nf] And, \"Whose are the fathers, and of whom according to the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for evermore.\"[fn-104-P10460_3294261:279-nf] What, then, shall we say? Does Scripture set before us two Gods? How, then, does it say that \"God is one? \"Or is not Christ God also? How, then, is it said to Christ,\" My Lord and my God? \"Unless, therefore, we hold all this with fitting veneration and lawful argument, we shall reasonably be thought to have furnished a scandal to the heretics, not assuredly by the fault of the heavenly Scriptures, which never deceive; but by the presumption of human error, whereby they have chosen to be heretics. And in the first place, we must turn the attack against them who undertake to make against us the charge of saying that there are two Gods. It is written, and they cannot deny it, that \"there is one Lord.\"[fn-104-P10461_3294989:280-nf] What, then, do they think of Christ?-that He is Lord, or that He is not Lord at all? But they do not doubt absolutely that He is Lord; therefore, if their reasoning be true, here are already two Lords. How, then, is it true according to the Scriptures, there is one Lord? And Christ is called the \"one Master.\"[fn-104-P10462_3295322:281-nf] Nevertheless we read that the Apostle Paul also is a master.[fn-104-P10463_3295410:282-nf] Then, according to this, our Master is not one, for from these things we conclude that there are two masters. How, then, according to the Scriptures, is \"one our Master, even Christ? \"In the Scriptures there is one \"called good, even God; \"but in the same Scriptures Christ is also asserted to be good. There is not, then, if they rightly conclude, one good, but even two good. How, then, according to the scriptural faith, is there said to be only one good? But if they do not think that it can by any means interfere with the truth that there is one Lord, that Christ also is Lord, nor with the truth that one is our. Master, that Paul also is our master, or with the truth that one is good, that Christ also is called good; on the same reasoning, let them understand that, from the fact that God is one, no obstruction arises to the truth that Christ also is declared to be God.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":37,"verse":22,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_56_of_patience_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"ANF-03","text":"So amply sufficient a Depositary of patience is God. If it be a wrong which you deposit in His care, He is an Avenger; if a loss, He is a Restorer; if pain, He is a Healer; if death, He is a Reviver. What honour is granted to Patience, to have God as her Debtor! And not without reason: for she keeps all His decrees; she has to do with all His mandates. She fortifies faith; is the pilot of peace; assists charity; establishes humility; waits long for repentance; sets tier seal on confession; rules the flesh; preserves the spirit; bridles the tongue; restrains the hand; tramples temptations under foot; drives away scandals; gives their crowning grace to martyrdoms; consoles the poor; teaches the rich moderation; overstrains not the weak; exhausts not the strong; is the delight of the believer; invites the Gentile; commends the servant to his lord, and his lord to God; adorns the woman; makes the man approved; is loved in childhood, praised in youth, looked up to in age; is beauteous in either sex, in every time of life. Come, now, see whether[fn-124-P12401_3463980:164-nf] we have a general idea of her mien and habit. Her countenance is tranquil and peaceful; her brow serene[fn-124-P12402_3464307:165-nf] contracted by no wrinkle of sadness or of anger; her eyebrows evenly relaxed in gladsome wise, with eyes downcast in humility, not in unhappiness; her mouth sealed with the honourable mark of silence; her hue such as theirs who are without care and without guilt; the motion of her head frequent against the devil, and her laugh threatening;[fn-124-P12403_3464681:166-nf] her clothing, moreover, about her bosom white and well fitted to her person, as being neither inflated nor disturbed. For Patience sits on the throne of that calmest and gentlest Spirit, who is not found in the roll of the whirlwind, nor in the leaden hue of the cloud but is of soft serenity, open and simple, whom Elias saw at his third essay.[fn-124-P12404_3465087:167-nf] For where God is, there too is His foster-child, namely Patience. When God's Spirit descends, then Patience accompanies Him indivisibly. If we do not give admission to her together with the Spirit, will (He) always tarry with us? Nay, I know not whether He would remain any longer. Without His companion and handmaid, He must of necessity be straitened in every place and at every time.

For, as it is said, \"God saw everything that He had made, and, behold, it was very good.\"[fn-14-P1406_391115:36-nf] But truly these men do not reflect on[fn-14-P1407_391170:37-nf] the analogies even of small familiar things which might come under their observation at any time, and from which they might learn that no object of any utility, and fitted to be serviceable, is made without design or by mere chance, but is wrought by skill of hand, and is contrived so as to meet its proper use. And when the object falls out of service and becomes useless, then it also begins to break up indeterminately, and to decompose and dissipate its materials in every casual and unregulated way, just as the wisdom by which it was skilfully constructed at first no longer controls and maintains it. For a cloak, for example, cannot be made without the weaver, as if the warp could be set aright and the woof could be entwined with it by their own spontaneous action; while, on the other hand, if it is once worn out, its tattered rags are flung aside. Again, when a house or a city is built, it does not take on its stones, as if some of them placed themselves spontaneously upon the foundations, and others lifted themselves up on the several layers, but the builder carefully disposes the skilfully prepared stones in their proper positions; while if the structure happens once to give way, the stones are separated and cast down and scattered about. And so, too, when a ship is built, the keel does not lay itself, neither does the mast erect itself in the centre, nor do all the other timbers take up their positions casually and by their own motion. Nor, again, do the so-called hundred beams in the wain fit themselves spontaneously to the vacant spaces they severally light on. But the carpenter in both cases puts the materials together in the right way and at the right time.[fn-14-P1408_393015:38-nf] And if the ship goes to sea and is wrecked, or if the wain drives along on land and is shattered, their timbers are broken up and cast abroad anywhere,-those of the former by the waves, and those of the latter by the violence of the impetus. In like manner, then, we might with all propriety say also to these men, that those atoms of theirs, which remain idle and unmanipulated and useless, are introduced vainly. Let them, accordingly, seek for themselves to see into what is beyond the reach of sight, and conceive what is beyond the range of conception;[fn-14-P1409_393674:39-nf] unlike him who in these terms confesses to God that things like these had been shown him only by God Himself: \"Mine eyes did see Thy work, being till then imperfect.\"[fn-14-P1410_394658:40-nf] But when they assert now that all those things of grace and beauty, which they declare to be textures finely wrought out of atoms, are fabricated spontaneously by these bodies without either wisdom or perception in them, who can endure to hear[fn-14-P1411_395663:41-nf] them talk in such terms of those unregulated[fn-14-P1412_395990:42-nf] atoms, than which even the spider, that plies its proper craft of itself, is gifted with more sagacity?","title":"Part I.-Containing Various Sections of the Works.","author":"Dionysius"}]
