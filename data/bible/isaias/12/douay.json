{"verses":["And thou shalt say in that day:  I will give thanks to thee, O\nLord, for thou wast angry with me:  thy wrath is turned away, and thou\nhast comforted me.","Behold, God is my saviour, I will deal confidently, and will not\nfear:  because the Lord is my strength, and my praise, and he is become\nmy salvation.","Thou shall draw waters with joy out of the saviour's fountains:","And you shall say in that day:  Praise ye the Lord, and call upon\nhis name:  make his works known among the people:  remember that his name\nis high.","Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath done great things:  shew this\nforth in all the earth.","Rejoice, and praise, O thou habitation of Sion:  for great is he\nthat is in the midst of thee, the Holy One of Israel."]}
