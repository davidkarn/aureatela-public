{"verses":["Thus saith the Lord:  Keep ye judgment, and do justice:  for my\nsalvation is near to come, and my justice to be revealed.","Blessed is the man that doth this, and the son of man that shall\nlay hold on this:  that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it, that\nkeepeth his hands from doing any evil.","And let not the son of the stranger, that adhereth to the Lord,\nspeak, saying:  The Lord will divide and separate me from his people.\nAnd let not the eunuch say:  Behold I am a dry tree.","For thus saith the Lord to the eunuchs, They that shall keep my\nsabbaths, and shall choose the things that please me, and shall hold\nfast my covenant:","I will give to them in my house, and within my walls, a place,\nand a name better than sons and daughters:  I will give them an\neverlasting name which shall never perish.","And the children of the stranger that adhere to the Lord, to\nworship him, and to love his name, to be his servants:  every one that\nkeepeth the sabbath from profaning it, and that holdeth fast my\ncovenant:","I will bring them into my holy mount, and will make them joyful\nin my house of prayer:  their holocausts, and their victims shall please\nme upon my altar:  for my house shall be called the house of prayer, for\nall nations.","The Lord God, who gathereth the scattered of Israel, saith:  I\nwill still gather unto him his congregation.","All ye beasts of the field come to devour, all ye beasts of the\nforest.","His watchmen are all blind, they are all ignorant:  dumb dogs not\nable to bark, seeing vain things, sleeping and loving dreams.","And most impudent dogs, they never had enough:  the shepherds\nthemselves knew no understanding:  all have turned aside into their own\nway, every one after his own gain, from the first even to the last.","Come, let us take wine, and be filled with drunkenness:  and it\nshall be as to day, so also to morrow, and much more."]}
