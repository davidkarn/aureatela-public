{"verses":["Come down, sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on\nthe ground:  there is no throne for the daughter of the Chaldeans, for\nthou shalt no more be called delicate and tender.","Take a millstone and grind meal:  uncover thy shame, strip thy\nshoulder, make bare thy legs, pass over the rivers.","Thy nakedness shall be discovered, and thy shame shall be seen:  I\nwill take vengeance, and no man shall resist me.","Our redeemer, the Lord of hosts is his name, the Holy One of\nIsrael.","Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the\nChaldeans:  for thou shalt no more be called the lady of kingdoms.","I was angry with my people, I have polluted my inheritance, and\nhave given them into thy hand:  thou hast shewn no mercy to them:  upon\nthe ancient thou hast laid thy yoke exceeding heavy.","And thou hast said:  I shall be a lady for ever:  thou hast not\nlaid these things to thy heart, neither hast thou remembered thy latter\nend.","And now hear these things, thou that art delicate, and dwellest\nconfidently, that sayest in thy heart:  I am, and there is none else\nbesides me:  I shall not sit as a widow, and I shall not know\nbarrenness.","These two things shall come upon thee suddenly in one day,\nbarrenness and widowhood.  All things are come upon thee, because of the\nmultitude of thy sorceries, and for the great hardness of thy\nenchanters.","And thou hast trusted in thy wickedness, and hast said:  There is\nnone that seeth me.  Thy wisdom, and, thy knowledge, this hath deceived\nthee.  And thou hast said in thy heart:  I am, and besides me there is no\nother.","Evil shall come upon thee, and thou shalt not know the rising\nthereof:  and calamity shall fall violently upon thee, which thou canst\nnot keep off:  misery shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou shalt\nnot know.","Stand now with thy enchanters, and with the multitude of thy\nsorceries, in which thou hast laboured from thy youth, if so be it may\nprofit thee any thing, or if thou mayst become stronger.","Thou hast failed in the multitude of thy counsels:  let now the\nastrologers stand and save thee, they that gazed at the stars, and\ncounted the months, that from them they might tell the things that\nshall come to thee.","Behold they are as stubble, fire hath burnt them, they shall not\ndeliver themselves from the power of the flames:  there are no coals\nwherewith they may be warmed, nor fire, that they may sit thereat.","Such are all the things become to thee, in which thou hast\nlaboured:  thy merchants from thy youth, every one hath erred in his own\nway, there is none that can save thee."]}
