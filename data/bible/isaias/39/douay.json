{"verses":["At that time Merodach Baladan, the son of Baladan king of\nBabylon, sent letters and presents to Ezechias:  for he had heard that\nhe had been sick and was recovered.","And Ezechias rejoiced at their coming, and he shewed them the\nstorehouses of his aromatical spices, and of the silver, and of the\ngold, and of the sweet odours, and of the precious ointment, and all\nthe storehouses of his furniture, and all things that were found in his\ntreasures.  There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion that\nEzechias shewed them not.","Then Isaias the prophet came to king Ezechias, and said to him:\nWhat said these men, and from whence came they to thee?  And Ezechias\nsaid:  From a far country they came to me, from Babylon.","And he said:  What saw they in thy house?  And Ezechias said:  All\nthings that are in my house have they seen, there was not any thing\nwhich I have not shewn them in my treasures.","And Isaias said to Ezechias:  Hear the word of the Lord of hosts.","Behold the days shall come that all that is in thy house, and\nthat thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried\naway into Babylon:  there shall not any thing be left, saith the Lord.","And of thy children, that shall issue from thee, whom thou shalt\nbeget, they shall take away, and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of\nthe king of Babylon.","And Ezechias said to Isaias:  The word of the Lord, which he hath\nspoken, is good.  And he said:  Only let peace and truth be in my days."]}
