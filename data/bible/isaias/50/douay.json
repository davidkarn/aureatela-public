{"verses":["Thus saith the Lord:  What is this bill of the divorce of your\nmother, with which I have put her away?  or who is my creditor, to whom\nI sold you:  behold you are sold for your iniquities, and for your\nwicked deeds have I put your mother away.","Because I came, and there was not a man:  I called, and there was\nnone that would hear.  Is my hand shortened and become little, that I\ncannot redeem?  or is there no strength in me to deliver?  Behold at my\nrebuke I will make the sea a desert, I will turn the rivers into dry\nland:  the fishes shall rot for want of water, and shall die for thirst.","I will clothe the heavens with darkness, and will make sackcloth\ntheir covering.","The Lord hath given me a learned tongue, that I should know how\nto uphold by word him that is weary:  he wakeneth in the morning, in the\nmorning he wakeneth my ear, that I may hear him as a master.","The Lord God hath opened my ear, and I do not resist:  I have not\ngone back.","I have given my body to the strikers, and my cheeks to them that\nplucked them:  I have not turned away my face from them that rebuked me,\nand spit upon me.","The Lord God is my helper, therefore am I not confounded:\ntherefore have I set my face as a most hard rock, and I know that I\nshall not be confounded.","He is near that justifieth me, who will contend with me?  let us\nstand together, who is my adversary?  let him come near to me.","Behold the Lord God is my helper:  who is he that shall condemn\nme?  Lo, they shall all be destroyed as a garment, the moth shall eat\nthem up.","Who is there among you that feareth the Lord, that heareth the\nvoice of his servant, that hath walked in darkness, and hath no light?\nlet him hope in the name of the Lord, and lean upon his God.","Behold all you that kindle a fire, encompassed with flames, walk\nin the light of your fire, and in the flames which you have kindled:\nthis is done to you by my hand, you shall sleep in sorrows."]}
