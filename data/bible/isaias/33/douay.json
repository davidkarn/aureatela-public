{"verses":["Woe to thee that spoilest, shalt not thou thyself also be\nspoiled?  and thou that despisest, shalt not thyself also be despised?\nwhen thou shalt have made an end of spoiling, thou shalt be spoiled:\nwhen being wearied thou shalt cease to despise, thou shalt be despised.","O Lord, have mercy on us:  for we have waited for thee:  be thou\nour arm in the morning, and our salvation in the time of trouble.","At the voice of the angel the people fled, and at the lifting up\nthyself the nations are scattered.","And your spoils shall be gathered together as the locusts are\ngathered, as when the ditches are full of them.","The Lord is magnified, for he hath dwelt on high:  he hath filled\nSion with judgment and justice.","And there shall be faith in thy times:  riches of salvation,\nwisdom and knowledge:  the fear of the Lord is his treasure.","Behold they that see shall cry without, the angels of peace shall\nweep bitterly.","The ways are made desolate, no one passeth by the road, the\ncovenant is made void, he hath rejected the cities, he hath not\nregarded the men.","The land hath mourned, and languished:  Libanus is confounded, and\nbecome foul, and Saron is become as a desert:  and Basan and Carmel are\nshaken.","Now will I rise up, saith the Lord:  now will I be exalted, now\nwill I lift up myself.","You shall conceive heat, you shall bring forth stubble:  your\nbreath as fire shall devour you.","And the people shall be as ashes after a fire, as a bundle of\nthorns they shall be burnt with fire.","Hear, you that are far off, what I have done, and you that are\nnear know my strength.","The sinners in Sion are afraid, trembling hath seized upon the\nhypocrites.  Which of you can dwell with devouring fire?  which of you\nshall dwell with everlasting burnings?","He that walketh in justices, and speaketh truth, that casteth\naway avarice by oppression, and shaketh his hands from all bribes, that\nstoppeth his ears lest he hear blood, and shutteth his eyes that he may\nsee no evil.","He shall dwell on high, the fortifications of rocks shall be his\nhighness:  bread is given him, his waters are sure.","His eyes shall see the king in his beauty, they shall see the\nland far off.","Thy heart shall meditate fear:  where is the learned?  where is he\nthat pondered the words of the law?  where is the teacher of little\nones?","The shameless people thou shalt not see, the people of profound\nspeech:  so that thou canst not understand the eloquence of his tongue,\nin whom there is no wisdom.","Look upon Sion the city of our solemnity:  thy eyes shall see\nJerusalem, a rich habitation, a tabernacle that cannot be removed:\nneither shall the nails thereof be taken away for ever, neither shall\nany of the cords thereof be broken.","Because only there our Lord is magnificent:  a place of rivers,\nvery broad and spacious streams:  no ship with oars shall pass by it,\nneither shall the great galley pass through it.","For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is\nour king:  he will save us.","Thy tacklings are loosed, and they shall be of no strength:  thy\nmast shall be in such condition, that thou shalt not be able to spread\nthe flag.  Then shall the spoils of much prey be divided:  the lame shall\ntake the spoil.","Neither shall he that is near, say:  I am feeble.  The people that\ndwell therein, shall have their iniquity taken away from them."]}
