The old law had a different ideal of blessedness, for therein it is said: \"Blessed is he who hath seed in Zion and a family in Jerusalem:\"[fn-7-P758_151979:480-nf] and \"Cursed is the barren who beareth not:\"[fn-7-P759_152049:481-nf] and \"Thy children shall be like olive-plants round about thy table.\"[fn-7-P760_152147:482-nf] Riches too are promised to the faithful and we are told that \"there was not one feeble person among their tribes.\"[fn-7-P761_152285:483-nf] But now even to eunuchs it is said, \"Say not, behold I am a dry tree,\"[fn-7-P762_152375:484-nf] for instead of sons and daughters you have a place forever in heaven. Now the poor are blessed, now Lazarus is set before Dives in his purple.[fn-7-P763_152538:485-nf] Now he who is weak is counted strong. But in those days the world was still unpeopled: accordingly, to pass over instances of childlessness meant only to serve as types, those only were considered happy who could boast of children. It was for this reason that Abraham in his old age married Keturah;[fn-7-P764_152867:486-nf] that Leah hired Jacob with her son's mandrakes,[fn-7-P765_152935:487-nf] and that fair Rachel-a type of the church-complained of the closing of her womb.[fn-7-P766_153040:488-nf] But gradually the crop grew up and then the reaper was sent forth with his sickle. Elijah lived a virgin life, so also did Elisha and many of the sons of the prophets. To Jeremiah the command came: \"Thou shall not take thee a wife.\"[fn-7-P767_153306:489-nf] He had been sanctified in his mother's womb,[fn-7-P768_153371:490-nf] and now he was forbidden to take a wife because the captivity was near. The apostle gives the same counsel in different words. \"I think, therefore, that this is good by reason of the present distress, namely that it is good for a man to be as he is.\"[fn-7-P769_153640:491-nf] What is this distress which does away with the joys of wedlock? The apostle tells us, in a later verse: \"The time is short: it remaineth that those who have wives be as though they had none.\"[fn-7-P770_153860:492-nf] Nebuchadnezzar is hard at hand. The lion is bestirring himself from his lair. What good will marriage be to me if it is to end in slavery to the haughtiest of kings? What good will little ones be to me if their lot is to be that which the prophet sadly describes: \"The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst; the young children ask for bread and no man breaketh it unto them\"?[fn-7-P771_154294:493-nf] In those days, as I have said, the virtue of continence was found only in men: Eve still continued to travail with children. But now that a virgin has conceived[fn-7-P772_154474:494-nf] in the womb and has borne to us a child of which the prophet says that \"Government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called the mighty God, the everlasting Father,\"[fn-7-P773_154676:495-nf] now the chain of the curse is broken. Death came through Eve, but life has come through Mary. And thus the gift of virginity has been bestowed most richly upon women, seeing that it has had its beginning from a woman. As soon as the Son of God set foot upon the earth, He formed for Himself a new household there; that, as He was adored by angels in heaven, angels might serve Him also on earth. Then chaste Judith once more cut off the head of Holofernes.[fn-7-P774_155152:496-nf] Then Haman-whose name means iniquity-was once more burned in fire of his own kindling.[fn-7-P775_155260:497-nf] Then James and John forsook father and net and ship and followed the Saviour: neither kinship nor the world's ties, nor the care of their home could hold them back. Then were the words heard: \"Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.\"[fn-7-P776_155565:498-nf] For no soldier goes with a wife to battle. Even when a disciple would have buried his father, the Lord forbade him, and said: \"Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man hath not where to lay His head.\"[fn-7-P777_155820:499-nf] So you must not complain if you have but scanty house-room. In the same strain, the apostle writes: \"He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord: but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world how he may please his wife. There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord that she may be holy both in body and in spirit.

The apostle writes to the Corinthians, \"Ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men, not many noble are called.\"[fn-27-P2726_712173:1932-nf] The conditions of the nascent church required this to be so that the grain of mustard seed might grow up little by little into a tree,[fn-27-P2727_712330:1933-nf] and that the leaven of the gospel might gradually raise more and more the whole lump of the church.[fn-27-P2728_712455:1934-nf] In our day Rome possesses what the world in days gone by knew not of.

Isaiah tells of the mystery of our faith and hope:[fn-63-P6388_1964354:224-nf] \"Behold a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Emmanuel.\" I know that the Jews are accustomed to meet us with the objection that in Hebrew the word Almahdq does not mean a virgin, but a young woman. And, to speak truth, a virgin is properly called Bethulah, but a young woman, or a girl, is not Almah, but Naarah![fn-63-P6389_1964714:225-nf] What then is the meaning of Almah? A hidden virgin, that is, not merely virgin, but a virgin and something more, because not every virgin is hidden, shut off from the occasional sight of men. Then again, Rebecca, on account of her extreme purity, and because she was a type of the Church which she represented in her own virginity, is described in Genesis as Almah, not Bethulah, as may clearly be proved from the words of Abraham's servant, spoken by him in Mesopotamia:[fn-63-P6390_1965468:226-nf] \"And he said, O Lord, the God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go: behold I stand by the fountain of water; and let it come to pass, that the maiden which cometh forth to draw, to whom I shall say, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of this pitcher to drink; and she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the Lord hath appointed for my master's son.\" Where he speaks of the maiden coming forth to draw water, the Hebrew word is Almah, that is, a virgin secluded, and guarded by her parents with extreme care. Or, if if this be not so, let them at least show me where the word is applied to married women as well, and I will confess my ignorance. \"Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son.\" If virginity be not preferred to marriage, why did not the Holy Spirit choose a married woman, or a widow? For at that time Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser, was alive, distinguished for purity, and always free to devote herself to prayers and fasting in the temple of God. If the life, and good works, and fasting without virginity can merit the advent of the Holy Spirit, she might well have been the mother of our Lord. Let us hasten to the rest:[fn-63-P6391_1966749:227-nf] \"The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn.\" To her whom he called daughter the prophet also gave the title virgin, for fear that if he spoke only of a daughter, it might be supposed that she was married. This is the virgin daughter whom elsewhere he thus addresses:[fn-63-P6392_1967070:228-nf] \"Sing, O barren, thou that dost not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate, than the children of the married wife, saith the Lord.\" This is she of whom God by the mouth of Jeremiah speaks, saying:[fn-63-P6393_1967376:229-nf] \"Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire.\" Concerning her we read of a great miracle in the same prophecy[fn-63-P6394_1967519:230-nf] -that a woman should compass a man, and that the Father of all things should be contained in a virgin's womb.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":54,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_22_book_i_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"87","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"If this grace is to be called \"teaching,\" let it at any rate be so called in such wise that God may be believed to infuse it, along with an ineffable sweetness, more deeply and more internally, not only by their agency who plant and water from without, but likewise by His own too who ministers in secret His own increase,-in such a way, that He not only exhibits truth, but likewise imparts love. For it is thus that God teaches those who have been called according to His purpose, giving them simultaneously both to know what they ought to do, and to do what they know.

Because the old testament was revealed through Moses, by whom the holy and just and good law was given, whereby should be brought about not the doing away but the knowledge of sin,-by which the proud might be convicted who were desirous of establishing their own righteousness, as if they had no need of divine help, and being made guilty of the letter, might flee to the Spirit of grace, not to be justified by their own righteousness, but by that of God-that is, by the righteousness which was given to them of God. For as the same apostle says, \"By the law is the knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and by the prophets.\"[fn-54-P5471_2143467:53-nf] Because the law, by the very fact that in it no man is justified, affords a witness to the righteousness of God. For that in the law no man is justified before God is manifest, because \"the just by faith lives.\"[fn-54-P5472_2143702:54-nf] Thus, therefore, although the law does not justify the wicked when he is convicted of transgression, it sends to the God who justifieth, and thus affords a testimony to the righteousness of God. Moreover, the prophets offer testimony to God's righteousness by fore-announcing Christ, \"who is made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: that, as it is written, he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.\"[fn-54-P5473_2144168:55-nf] But that law was kept hidden from the beginning, when nature itself convicted wicked men, who did to others what they would not have done to themselves. But the revelation of the new testament in Christ was made when He was manifested in the flesh, wherein appeared the righteousness of God -that is, the righteousness which is to men from God. For hence he says, \"But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested.\"[fn-54-P5474_2144621:56-nf] This is the reason why the former is called the old testament, because it was revealed in the earlier time; and the latter the new, because it was revealed in the later time. In a word, it is because the old testament pertains to the old man, from which it is necessary that a man should make a beginning; but the new to the new man, by which a than ought to pass from his old state. Thus, in the former are earthly promises, in the latter heavenly promises; because this pertained to God's mercy, that no one should think that even earthly felicity of any kind whatever could be conferred on anybody, save from the Lord, who is the Creator of all things. But if God is worshipped for the sake of that earthly happiness, the worship is that of a slave, belonging to the children of the bondmaid; but if for the sake of God Himself, so that in the life eternal God may be all things in all, it is a free service belonging to the children of the freewoman, who is our mother eternal in the heavens-who first seemed, as it were, barren, when she had not any children manifest; but now we see what was prophesied concerning her: \"Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for there are many children of the desolate more than of her who has an husband,\"[fn-54-P5475_2145935:57-nf] -that is, more than of that Jerusalem, who in a certain manner is married in the bond of the law, and is in bondage with her children. In the time, then, of the old testament, we say that the Holy Spirit, in those who even then were the children of promise according to Isaac, was not only an assistant, which these men think is sufficient for their opinion, but also a bestower of virtue; and this they deny, attributing it rather to their free will, in contradiction to those fathers who knew how to cry unto God with truthful piety, \"I will love Thee, O Lord, my strength.\"[fn-54-P5476_2146530:58-nf] ","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":54,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_33_oration_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"8.

For with what reason should we believe of a crucified man that He is the first-born of the unbegotten God, and Himself will pass judgment on the whole human race, unless we had found testimonies concerning Him published before He came and was born as man, and unless we saw that things had happened accordingly-the devastation of the land of the Jews, and men of every race persuaded by His teaching through the apostles, and rejecting their old habits, in which, being deceived, they had their conversation; yea, seeing ourselves too, and knowing that the Christians from among the Gentiles are both more numerous and more true than those from among the Jews and Samaritans? For all the other human races are called Gentiles by the Spirit of prophecy; but the Jewish and Samaritan races are called the tribe of Israel, and the house of Jacob. And the prophecy in which it was predicted that there should be more believers from the Gentiles than from the Jews and Samaritans, we will produce: it ran thus: \"Rejoice, O barren, thou that dost not bear; break forth and shout, thou that dost not travail, because many more are the children of the desolate than of her that hath an husband.\"[fn-38-P3866_719783:112-nf] For all the Gentiles were \"desolate\" of the true God, serving the works of their hands; but the Jews and Samaritans, having the word of God delivered to them by the prophets, and always expecting the Christ, did not recognise Him when He came, except some few, of whom the Spirit of prophecy by Isaiah had predicted that they should be saved. He spoke as from their person: \"Except the Lord had left us a seed, we should have been as Sodom and Gomorrah.\"[fn-38-P3867_720259:113-nf] For Sodom and Gomorrah are related by Moses to have been cities of ungodly men, which God burned with fire and brimstone, and overthrew, no one of their inhabitants being saved except a certain stranger, a Chaldaean by birth, whose name was Lot; with whom also his daughters were rescued. And those who care may yet see their whole country desolate and burned, and remaining barren. And to show how those from among the Gentiles were foretold as more true and more believing, we will cite what was said by Isaiah[fn-38-P3868_720790:114-nf] the prophet; for he spoke as follows \"Israel is uncircumcised in heart, but the Gentiles are uncircumcised in the flesh.\" So many things therefore, as these, when they are seen with the eye, are enough to produce conviction and belief in those who embrace the truth, and are not bigoted in their opinions, nor are governed by their passions.","title":"The First Apology of Justin","author":"Justin Martyr"},{"chapter":54,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_37_book_i_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"57","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"31.

For righteous Noah, along with the other mortals at the deluge, i.e., with his own wife, his three sons and their wives, being eight in number, were a symbol of the eighth day, wherein Christ appeared when He rose from the dead, for ever the first in power. For Christ, being the first-born of every creature, became again the chief of another race regenerated by Himself through water, and faith, and wood, containing the mystery of the cross; even as Noah was saved by wood when he rode over the waters with his household. Accordingly, when the prophet says, `I saved thee in the times of Noah, 'as I have already remarked, he addresses the people who are equally faithful to God, and possess the same signs. For when Moses had the rod in his hands, he led your nation through the sea. And you believe that this was spoken to your nation only, or to the land. But the whole earth, as the Scripture says, was inundated, and the water rose in height fifteen cubits above all the mountains: so that it is evident this was not spoken to the land, but to the people who obeyed Him: for whom also He had before prepared a resting-place in Jerusalem, as was previously demonstrated by all the symbols of the deluge; I mean, that by water, faith, and wood, those who are afore-prepared, and who repent of the sins which they have committed, shall escape from the impending judgment of God.","title":"Dialogue of Justin","author":"Justin Martyr"},{"chapter":54,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_38_letter_of_an_inquirer_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"129","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"§6.

As it is written\nthat when Jeremiah caused the nations and kingdoms to drink the cup of wrath, he said concerning each\none of the cities, that after they shall drink the cup, I will turn back the captivity of\nElam, of Tyre, of Zidon, of the children of Ammon, and of Moab, and of Edom.[fn-45-P4533_1514921:19-nf] Concerning each one of these kingdoms he\nsaid:-In the last days I well turn back her captivity.

And if to Abraham on his believing it was counted for righteousness; and if we are the seed of Abraham, then we must also believe through heating. For we are Israelites, who are convinced not by signs, but by hearing.

As the apostle also says in the Epistle to the Romans, \"For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith,\" teaching the one salvation which from prophecy to the Gospel is perfected by one and the same Lord. \"This charge,\" he says, \"I commit to thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war the good warfare; holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck,\"[fn-57-P5729_1736337:68-nf] because they defiled by unbelief the conscience that comes from God. Accordingly, faith may not, any more, with reason, be disparaged in an offhand way, as simple and vulgar, appertaining to anybody. For, if it were a mere human habit, as the Greeks supposed, it would have been extinguished. But if it grow, and there be no place where it is not; then I affirm, that faith, whether founded in love, or in fear, as its disparagers assert, is something divine; which is neither rent asunder by other mundane friendship, nor dissolved by the presence of fear. For love, on account of its friendly alliance with faith, makes men believers; and faith, which is the foundation of love, in its turn introduces the doing of good; since also fear, the paedagogue of the law, is believed to be fear by those, by whom it is believed. For, if its existence is shown in its working, it is yet believed when about to do and threatening, and when not working and present; and being believed to exist, it does not itself generate faith, but is by faith tested and proved trustworthy. Such a change, then, from unbelief to faith-and to trust in hope and fear, is divine. And, in truth, faith is discovered, by us, to be the first movement towards salvation; after which fear, and hope, and repentance, advancing in company with temperance and patience, lead us to love and knowledge. Rightly, therefore, the Apostle Barnabas says, \"From the portion I have received I have done my diligence to send by little and little to you; that along with your faith you may also have perfect knowledge.[fn-57-P5730_1737935:69-nf] Fear and patience are then helpers of your faith; and our allies are long-suffering and temperance. These, then,\" he says, \"in what respects the Lord, continuing in purity, there rejoice along with them, wisdom, understanding, intelligence, knowledge.\" The fore-mentioned virtues being, then, the elements of knowledge; the result is that faith is more elementary, being as necessary to the Gnostic,[fn-57-P5731_1738460:70-nf] as respiration to him that lives in this world is to life. And as without the four elements it is not possible to live, so neither can knowledge be attained without faith. It is then the support of truth.","title":"Book II.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":54,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_63_book_v_","source_chapter":36,"source_paragraph":"179","folder":"ANF-01","text":"4.

For our part, our purpose has been simply to say that what we affirm of that sacred land has not been taken from Plato or any of the Greeks, but that they rather-living as they did not only after Moses, who was the oldest, but even after most of the prophets-borrowed from them, and in so doing either misunderstood their obscure intimations on such subjects, or else endeavoured, in their allusions to the better land, to imitate those portions of Scripture which had fallen into their hands.

Of all the temples spoken of in this sense, the best and most excellent was the pure and holy body of our Saviour Jesus Christ. When He knew that wicked men might aim at the destruction of the temple of God in Him, but that their purposes of destruction would not prevail against the divine power which had built that temple, He says to them, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it again....
