{"verses":["Who a hath believed our report?  and to whom is the arm of the\nLord revealed?","And he shall grow up as a tender plant before him, and as a root\nout of a thirsty ground:  there is no beauty in him, nor comeliness:  and\nwe have seen him, and there was no sightliness, that we should be\ndesirous of him:","Despised, and the most abject of men, a man of sorrows, and\nacquainted with infirmity:  and his look was as it were hidden and\ndespised, whereupon we esteemed him not.","Surely he hath borne our infirmities and carried our sorrows:  and\nwe have thought him as it were a leper, and as one struck by God and\nafflicted.","But he was wounded for our iniquities, he was bruised for our\nsins:  the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and by his bruises we\nare healed.","All we like sheep have gone astray, every one hath turned aside\ninto his own way:  and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.","He was offered because it was his own will, and he opened not his\nmouth:  he shall be led as a sheep to the slaughter, and shall be dumb\nas a lamb before his shearer, and he shall not open his mouth.","He was taken away from distress, and from judgment:  who shall\ndeclare his generation?  because he is cut off out of the land of the\nliving:  for the wickedness of my people have I struck him.","And he shall give the ungodly for his burial, and the rich for\nhis death:  because he hath done no iniquity, neither was there deceit\nin his mouth.","And the Lord was pleased to bruise him in infirmity:  if he shall\nlay down his life for sin, he shall see a longlived seed, and the will\nof the Lord shall be prosperous in his hand.","Because his soul hath laboured, he shall see and be filled:  by\nhis knowledge shall this my just servant justify many, and he shall\nbear their iniquities.","Therefore will I distribute to him very many, and he shall\ndivide the spoils of the strong, because he hath delivered his soul\nunto death, and was reputed with the wicked:  and he hath borne the sins\nof many, and hath prayed for the transgressors."]}
