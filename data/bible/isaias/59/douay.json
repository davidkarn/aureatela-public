{"verses":["Behold the hand of the Lord is not shortened that it cannot save,\nneither is his ear heavy that it cannot hear.","But your iniquities have divided between you and your God, and\nyour sins have hid his face from you that he should not hear.","For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with\niniquity:  your lips have spoken lies, and your tongue uttereth\niniquity.","There is none that calleth upon justice, neither is there any one\nthat judgeth truly:  but they trust in a mere nothing, and speak\nvanities:  they have conceived labour, and brought forth iniquity.","They have broken the eggs of asps, and have woven the webs of\nspiders:  he that shall eat of their eggs, shall die:  and that which is\nbrought out, shall be hatched into a basilisk.","Their webs shall not be for clothing, neither shall they cover\nthemselves with their works:  their works are unprofitable works, and\nthe work of iniquity is in their hands.","Their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed innocent blood:\ntheir thoughts are unprofitable thoughts:  wasting and destruction are\nin their ways.","They have not known the way of peace, and there is no judgment in\ntheir steps:  their paths are become crooked to them, every one that\ntreadeth in them knoweth no peace.","Therefore is judgment far from us, and justice shall not overtake\nus.  We looked for light, and behold darkness:  brightness, and we have\nwalked in the dark.","We have groped for the wall, and like the blind we have groped\nas if we had no eyes:  we have stumbled at noonday as in darkness, we\nare in dark places, as dead men.","We shall roar all of us like bears, and shall lament as mournful\ndoves.  We have looked for judgment, and there is none:  for salvation,\nand it is far from us.","For our iniquities are multiplied before thee, and our sins have\ntestified against us:  for our wicked doings are with us, and have known\nour iniquities:","In sinning and lying against the Lord:  and we have turned away\nso that we went not after our God, but spoke calumny and transgression:\nwe have conceived, and uttered from the heart, words of falsehood.","And judgment is turned away backward, and justice hath stood far\noff:  because truth hath fallen down in the street, and equity could not\ncome in.","And truth hath been forgotten:  and he that departed from evil,\nlay open to be a prey:  and the Lord saw, and it appeared evil in his\neyes, because there is no judgment.","And he saw that there is not a man:  and he stood astonished,\nbecause there is none to oppose himself:  and his own arm brought\nsalvation to him, and his own justice supported him.","He put on justice as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation\nupon his head:  he put on the garments of vengeance, and was clad with\nzeal as with a cloak.","As unto revenge, as it were to repay wrath to his adversaries,\nand a reward to his enemies:  he will repay the like to the islands.","And they from the west, shall fear the name of the Lord:  and\nthey from the rising of the sun, his glory when he shall come as a\nviolent stream, which the spirit of the Lord driveth on:","And there shall come a redeemer to Sion, and to them that return\nfrom iniquity in Jacob, saith the Lord.","This is my covenant with them, saith the Lord:  My spirit that is\nin thee, and my words that I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart\nout of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the\nmouth of thy seed's seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever."]}
