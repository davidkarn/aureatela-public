But what can we suppose to have been the reason why it was not found, though sought with the greatest earnestness and labour by so many intellects, and during so many ages, unless it be that philosophers sought for it out of their own limits? And since they traversed and explored all parts, but nowhere found any wisdom, and it must of necessity be somewhere, it is evident that it ought especially to be sought there where the title of folly[fn-11-P1128_505968:6-nf] appears; under the covering of which God hides the treasury of wisdom and truth, lest the secret of His divine work should be exposed to view.[fn-11-P1129_506135:7-nf] Whence I am accustomed to wonder that, when Pythagoras, and after him Plato, inflamed with the love of searching out the truth, had penetrated as far as to the Egyptians, and Magi, and Persians, that they might become acquainted with their religious rites and institutions (for they suspected that wisdom was concerned with religion), they did not approach the Jews only, in whose possession alone it then was, and to whom they might have gone more easily. But I think that they were turned away from them by divine providence, that they might not know the truth, because it was not yet permitted for the religion of the true God and righteousness to become known to men of other nations.[fn-11-P1130_506930:8-nf] For God had determined, as the last time drew near,[fn-11-P1131_507178:9-nf] to send from heaven a great leader,[fn-11-P1132_507299:10-nf] who should reveal to foreign nations that which was taken away from a perfidious[fn-11-P1133_507470:11-nf] and ungrateful people. And I will endeavour to discuss the subject in this book, if I shall first have shown that wisdom is so closely united with religion, that the one cannot be separated from the other.","title":"Book IV.

For even if thou shouldst despair of thyself ten thousand times, I will never despair of thee, and I will never myself be guilty of that for which I reproach others; and yet it is not the same thing for a man to renounce hope of himself, as for another to renounce hope of him. For he who has this suspicion concerning another may readily obtain pardon; but he who has it of himself will not. Why so pray? Because the one has no controlling power over the zeal and repentance of the other, but over his own zeal and repentance a man has sole authority. Nevertheless even so I will not despair of you; though you should any number of times be heard the prophet vehemently declaring, and plainly threatening; \"yet three days and Nineveh shall be overthrown,\" even then did not lose heart, but, although they had no confidence that they should be able to move the utterance was not accompanied by any qualification, but was a simple declaration), even then they manifested repentance saying: \"Who knoweth whether God will repent and be entreated, and turn from the fierceness of His wrath, and that we perish not? And God say their works that they turned from their evil ways, and God repented of the evil which He said He would do unto them and He did it not.\"[fn-6-P686_406269:64-nf] Now if barbarian, and unreasoning men could perceive so much, much more ought we to do this who have been trained in the divine doctrines and have seen such a crowd of example of this kind both in history and actual experience. \"For my counsels\" we read \"not as your counsels nor my ways as your ways; but far as is the Heaven from the earth, so far are my thoughts from your mind, and my counsels from your counsels.\"[fn-6-P687_406713:65-nf] Now if we admit to our favour household slaves when they have often offended against us, on their promising to become better, and place them again in their former portion, and sometimes even grant them greater freedom of speech than before; much more does God act thus. For if God had made us in order to punish us, you might well have despaired, and questioned the possibility of your own salvation; but if He created us for no reason than His own good will, and with a view to our enjoying everalasting blessings, and if He does and contrives everything for this end, from the first day until the present time, what is there which can ever cause you to doubt? Have we provoked Him severely, so as no other man ever did? this is just the reason why we ought specially to abstain from our present deeds and to repent for the past, and exhibit a great change. For the evils we have once perpetrated cannot provoke Him so much as our being unwilling to make any change in the future. For to sin may be a merely human failing, but to continue in the same sin ceases to be human, and becomes altogether devilish. For observe how God by the mouth of His prophet blames this more than the other. \"For,\" we read, \"I said unto her after she had done all these deeds of fornication, return unto me, and yet she returned not.\"[fn-6-P688_408054:66-nf] And again: from another quarter, when wishing to show the great longing which He has for our salvation, having heard how the people promised, after many transgressions, to tread the right way He said: \"Who will grant unto them to have such an heart as to fear me, and to keep my commandments all their days, that it may be well with them and with their children forever?\"[fn-6-P689_408477:67-nf] And Moses when reasoning with them said, \"And now, O Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, and to walk in all His ways, and to love Him?\"[fn-6-P690_408679:68-nf] He then who is so anxious to be loved by us, and does everything for this end, and did not spare even His only begotten Son on account of His love towards us, and who counts it a desirable thing if at any time we become reconciled to Himself, how shall He not welcome and love us when we repent? Hear at least what He says by the mouth of the prophet: \"Declare thou first thy iniquities that thou mayest be justified.\"[fn-6-P691_409116:69-nf] Now this He demands from us in order to intensify our love towards Him. For when one who loves, after enduring many insults at the hands of those who are beloved, even then does not extinguish his fondness for them, the only reason why he takes pains to make those insults public, is that by displaying the strength of his affection he may induce them to feel a larger and warmer love. Now if the confession of sins brings so much consolation, much more does the endeavour to wash them away by means of our deeds For if this was not the case, but those who had vehemence in evil things, will also in turn exhibit the same in good things, being conscious what great debts they have incurred; which Christ also declared when He spoke to Simon concerning the woman: \"For seeset thou,\" saith He, \"this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet; but she hath washed my feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. Thou gavest me no kiss, but she since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet. Mine head with oil thou didst not anoint; but she hath anointed my feet with ointment. Wherefore I say unto thee: her sins which are many are forgiven; for she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little. And He said unto her, thy sins are forgiven.\"[fn-6-P692_410457:70-nf] ","title":"Letter I.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":55,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_19_an_answer_to_the_jews_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"39","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Accordingly the times must be inquired into of the predicted and future nativity of the Christ, and of His passion, and of the extermination of the city of Jerusalem, that is, its devastation.

After a space of two days, on the third day\"[fn-24-P2455_800685:304-nf] -which is His glorious resurrection-He received back into the heavens (whence withal the Spirit Himself had come to the Virgin[fn-24-P2456_800866:305-nf] ) Him whose nativity and passion alike the Jews have failed to acknowledge. Therefore, since the Jews still contend that the Christ is not yet come, whom we have in so many ways approved[fn-24-P2457_801076:306-nf] to be come, let the Jews recognise their own fate, -a fate which they were constantly foretold as destined to incur after the advent of the Christ, on account of the impiety with which they despised and slew Him. For first, from the day when, according to the saying of Isaiah, \"a man cast forth his abominations of gold and silver, which they made to adore with vain and hurtful (rites),\"[fn-24-P2458_801586:307-nf] -that is, ever since we Gentiles, with our breast doubly enlightened through Christ's truth, cast forth (let the Jews see it) our idols,-what follows has likewise been fulfilled. For \"the Lord of Sabaoth hath taken away, among the Jews from Jerusalem,\" among the other things named, \"the wise architect\" too,[fn-24-P2459_801918:308-nf] who builds the church, God's temple, and the holy city, and the house of the Lord.

And \"the clouds were commanded not to rain a shower upon the vineyard of Sorek,\"[fn-24-P2460_802259:309-nf] -the clouds being celestial benefits, which were commanded not to be forthcoming to the house of Israel; for it \"had borne thorns\"-whereof that house of Israel had wrought a crown for Christ-and not \"righteousness, but a clamour,\"-the clamour whereby it had extorted His surrender to the cross.[fn-24-P2461_802596:310-nf] And thus, the former gifts of grace being withdrawn, \"the law and the prophets were until John,\"[fn-24-P2462_802795:311-nf] and the fishpool of Bethsaida[fn-24-P2463_802860:312-nf] until the advent of Christ: thereafter it ceased curatively to remove from Israel infirmities of health; since, as the result of their perseverance in their frenzy, the name of the Lord was through them blasphemed, as it is written: \"On your account the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles: \"[fn-24-P2464_803232:313-nf] for it is from them that the infamy (attached to that name) began, and (was propagated during) the interval from Tiberius to Vespasian.

For unless He come after whom they had to be accomplished, by no means would the events, the future occurrence whereof was predictively assigned to His advent, have come to pass.

For it is not said, The heart shall rejoice of them that find, but of them that seek, the Lord. And yet the prophet Isaiah testifies, that the Lord God can be found when He is sought, when he says: \"Seek ye the Lord; and as soon as ye have found Him, call upon Him: and when He has drawn near to you, let the wicked man forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts.\"[fn-19-P1908_949519:4-nf] If, then, when sought, He can be found, why is it said, \"Seek ye His face evermore?\" Is He perhaps to be sought even when found? For things incomprehensible must so be investigated, as that no one may think he has found nothing, when he has been able to find how incomprehensible that is which he was seeking. Why then does he so seek, if he comprehends that which he seeks to be incomprehensible, unless because he may not give over seeking so long as he makes progress in the inquiry itself into things incomprehensible, and becomes ever better and better while seeking so great a good, which is both sought in order to be found, and found in order to be sought? For it is both sought in order that it may be found more sweetly, and found in order that it may be sought more eagerly.

For the dispensation would not be found complete, if He had not come after whom it had to run on its course.[fn-51-P5108_1605481:282-nf] Look at all nations from the vortex of human error emerging out of it up to the Divine Creator, the Divine Christ, and deny Him to be the object of prophecy, if you dare. At once there will occur to you the Father's promise in the Psalms: \"Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten Thee. Ask of me, and I shall give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession.\"[fn-51-P5109_1605911:283-nf] You will not be able to put in a claim for some son of David being here meant, rather than Christ; or for the ends of the earth being promised to David, whose kingdom was confined to the Jewish nation simply, rather than to Christ, who now embraces the whole world in the faith of His gospel. So again He says by Isaiah: \"I have given Thee for a dispensation of the people, for a light of the Gentiles, to open the eyes of the blind,\" that is, those that be in error, \"to bring out the prisoners from the prison,\" that is, to free them from sin, \"and from the prison-house,\" that is, of death, \"those that sit in darkness\"-even that of ignorance.[fn-51-P5110_1606576:284-nf] If these things are accomplished through Christ, they would not have been designed in prophecy for any other than Him through whom they have their accomplishment. In another passage He also says: \"Behold, I have set Him as a testimony to the nations, a prince and commander to the nations; nations which know Thee not shall invoke Thee, and peoples shall run together unto Thee.\"[fn-51-P5111_1606979:285-nf] You will not interpret these words of David, because He previously said, \"I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.\"[fn-51-P5112_1607153:286-nf] Indeed, you will be obliged from these words all the more to understand that Christ is reckoned to spring from David by carnal descent, by reason of His birth[fn-51-P5113_1607331:287-nf] of the Virgin Mary. Touching this promise of Him, there is the oath to David in the psalm, \"Of the fruit of thy body[fn-51-P5114_1607479:288-nf] will I set upon thy throne.\"[fn-51-P5115_1607532:289-nf] What body is meant? David's own? Certainly not. For David was not to give birth to a son.[fn-51-P5116_1607645:290-nf] Nor his wife's either. For instead of saying, \"Of the fruit of thy body,\" he would then have rather said, \"Of the fruit of thy wife's body.\" But by mentioning his[fn-51-P5117_1607854:291-nf] body, it follows that He pointed to some one of his race of whose body the flesh of Christ was to be the fruit, which bloomed forth from[fn-51-P5118_1608006:292-nf] Mary's womb. He named the fruit of the body (womb) alone, because it was peculiarly fruit of the womb, of the womb only in fact, and not of the husband also; and he refers the womb (body) to David, as to the chief of the race and father of the family. Because it could not consist with a virgin's condition to consort her with a husband,[fn-51-P5119_1608363:293-nf] He therefore attributed the body (womb) to the father. That new dispensation, then, which is found in Christ now, will prove to be what the Creator then promised under the appellation of \"the sure mercies of David,\" which were Christ's, inasmuch as Christ sprang from David, or rather His very flesh itself was David's \"sure mercies,\" consecrated by religion, and \"sure\" after its resurrection. Accordingly the prophet Nathan, in the first of Kings,[fn-51-P5120_1608836:294-nf] makes a promise to David for his seed, \"which shall proceed,\" says he, \"out of thy bowels.\"[fn-51-P5121_1609122:295-nf] Now, if you explain this simply of Solomon, you will send me into a fit of laughter. For David will evidently have brought forth Solomon! But is not Christ here designated the seed of David, as of that womb which was derived from David, that is, Mary's? Now, because Christ rather than any other[fn-51-P5122_1609474:296-nf] was to build the temple of God, that is to say, a holy manhood, wherein God's Spirit might dwell as in a better temple, Christ rather than David's son Solomon was to be looked for as[fn-51-P5123_1609671:297-nf] the Son of God. Then, again, the throne for ever with the kingdom for ever is more suited to Christ than to Solomon, a mere temporal king. From Christ, too, God's mercy did not depart, whereas on Solomon even God's anger alighted, after his luxury and idolatry. For Satan[fn-51-P5124_1609963:298-nf] stirred up an Edomite as an enemy against him. Since, therefore, nothing of these things is compatible with Solomon, but only with Christ, the method of our interpretations will certainly be true; and the very issue of the facts shows that they were clearly predicted of Christ. And so in Him we shall have \"the sure mercies of David.\" Him, not David, has God appointed for a testimony to the nations; Him, for a prince and commander to the nations, not David, who ruled over Israel alone. It is Christ whom all nations now invoke, which knew Him not; Christ to whom all races now betake themselves, whom they were ignorant of before.

This has proved Him to be such a one as prophecy announced He should be, so that He ought not to be regarded in any other character than that which prediction assigned to Him; and the result of this agreement between the facts of His course and the Scriptures of the Creator should be the restoration of belief in them from that prejudice which has, by contributing to diversity of opinion, either thrown doubt upon, or led to a denial of, a considerable part of them And now we go further and build up the superstructure of those kindred events[fn-51-P5107_1605260:281-nf] out of the Scriptures of the Creator which were predicted and destined to happen after Christ. For the dispensation would not be found complete, if He had not come after whom it had to run on its course.[fn-51-P5108_1605481:282-nf] Look at all nations from the vortex of human error emerging out of it up to the Divine Creator, the Divine Christ, and deny Him to be the object of prophecy, if you dare. At once there will occur to you the Father's promise in the Psalms: \"Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten Thee. Ask of me, and I shall give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession.\"[fn-51-P5109_1605911:283-nf] You will not be able to put in a claim for some son of David being here meant, rather than Christ; or for the ends of the earth being promised to David, whose kingdom was confined to the Jewish nation simply, rather than to Christ, who now embraces the whole world in the faith of His gospel. So again He says by Isaiah: \"I have given Thee for a dispensation of the people, for a light of the Gentiles, to open the eyes of the blind,\" that is, those that be in error, \"to bring out the prisoners from the prison,\" that is, to free them from sin, \"and from the prison-house,\" that is, of death, \"those that sit in darkness\"-even that of ignorance.[fn-51-P5110_1606576:284-nf] If these things are accomplished through Christ, they would not have been designed in prophecy for any other than Him through whom they have their accomplishment. In another passage He also says: \"Behold, I have set Him as a testimony to the nations, a prince and commander to the nations; nations which know Thee not shall invoke Thee, and peoples shall run together unto Thee.\"[fn-51-P5111_1606979:285-nf] You will not interpret these words of David, because He previously said, \"I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.\"[fn-51-P5112_1607153:286-nf] Indeed, you will be obliged from these words all the more to understand that Christ is reckoned to spring from David by carnal descent, by reason of His birth[fn-51-P5113_1607331:287-nf] of the Virgin Mary. Touching this promise of Him, there is the oath to David in the psalm, \"Of the fruit of thy body[fn-51-P5114_1607479:288-nf] will I set upon thy throne.\"[fn-51-P5115_1607532:289-nf] What body is meant? David's own? Certainly not. For David was not to give birth to a son.[fn-51-P5116_1607645:290-nf] Nor his wife's either. For instead of saying, \"Of the fruit of thy body,\" he would then have rather said, \"Of the fruit of thy wife's body.\" But by mentioning his[fn-51-P5117_1607854:291-nf] body, it follows that He pointed to some one of his race of whose body the flesh of Christ was to be the fruit, which bloomed forth from[fn-51-P5118_1608006:292-nf] Mary's womb. He named the fruit of the body (womb) alone, because it was peculiarly fruit of the womb, of the womb only in fact, and not of the husband also; and he refers the womb (body) to David, as to the chief of the race and father of the family. Because it could not consist with a virgin's condition to consort her with a husband,[fn-51-P5119_1608363:293-nf] He therefore attributed the body (womb) to the father. That new dispensation, then, which is found in Christ now, will prove to be what the Creator then promised under the appellation of \"the sure mercies of David,\" which were Christ's, inasmuch as Christ sprang from David, or rather His very flesh itself was David's \"sure mercies,\" consecrated by religion, and \"sure\" after its resurrection.

To encourage a belief of this Gospel he has actually[fn-52-P5238_1638178:4-nf] devised for it a sort of dower,[fn-52-P5239_1638227:5-nf] in a work composed of contrary statements set in opposition, thence entitled Antitheses, and compiled with a view to such a severance of the law from the gospel as should divide the Deity into two, nay, diverse, gods-one for each Instrument, or Testament[fn-52-P5240_1638500:6-nf] as it is more usual to call it; that by such means he might also patronize[fn-52-P5241_1638600:7-nf] belief in \"the Gospel according to the Antitheses.\" These, however, I would have attacked in special combat, hand to hand; that is to say, I would have encountered singly the several devices Of the Pontic heretic, if it were not much more convenient to refute them in and with that very gospel to which they contribute their support. Although it is so easy to meet them at once with a peremptory demurrer,[fn-52-P5242_1639025:8-nf] yet, in order that I may both make them admissible in argument, and account them valid expressions of opinion, and even contend that they make for our side, that so there may be all the redder shame for the blindness of their author, we have now drawn out some antitheses of our own in opposition to Marcion.And indeed[fn-52-P5243_1639576:9-nf] I do allow that one order did run its course in the old dispensation under the Creator,[fn-52-P5244_1639680:10-nf] and that another is on its way in the new under Christ. I do not deny that there is a difference in the language of their documents, in their precepts of virtue, and in their teachings of the law; but yet all this diversity is consistent with one and the same God, even Him by whom it was arranged and also foretold. Long ago[fn-52-P5245_1640028:11-nf] did Isaiah declare that \"out of Sion should go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem\"[fn-52-P5246_1640142:12-nf] -some other law, that is, and another word. In short, says he, \"He shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; \"[fn-52-P5247_1640289:13-nf] meaning not those of the Jewish people only, but of the nations which are judged by the new law of the gospel and the new word of the apostles, and are amongst themselves rebuked of their old error as soon as they have believed. And as the result of this, \"they beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears (which are a kind of hunting instruments) into pruning-hooks; \"[fn-52-P5248_1640686:14-nf] that is to say, minds, which once were fierce and cruel, are changed by them into good dispositions productive of good fruit. And again: \"Hearken unto me, hearken unto me, my people, and ye kings, give ear unto me; for a law shall proceed from me, and my judgment for a light to the nations; \"[fn-52-P5249_1640997:15-nf] wherefore He had determined and decreed that the nations also were to be enlightened by the law and the word of the gospel. This will be that law which (according to David also) is unblameable, because \"perfect, converting the soul\"[fn-52-P5250_1641270:16-nf] from idols unto God. This likewise will be the word concerning which the same Isaiah says, \"For the Lord will make a decisive word in the land.\"[fn-52-P5251_1641432:17-nf] Because the New Testament is compendiously short,[fn-52-P5252_1641554:18-nf] and freed from the minute and perplexing[fn-52-P5253_1641614:19-nf] burdens of the law. But why enlarge, when the Creator by the same prophet foretells the renovation more manifestly and clearly than the light itself? \"Remember not the former things, neither consider the things of old\" (the old things have passed away, and new things are arising). \"Behold, I will do new things, which shall now spring forth.\"[fn-52-P5254_1641975:20-nf] So by Jeremiah: \"Break up for yourselves new pastures,[fn-52-P5255_1642055:21-nf] and sow not among thorns, and circumcise yourselves in the foreskin of your heart.\"[fn-52-P5256_1642186:22-nf] And in another passage: \"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Jacob, and with the house of Judah; not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I arrested their dispensation, in order to bring them out of the land of Egypt.\"[fn-52-P5257_1642532:23-nf] He thus shows that the ancient covenant is temporary only, when He indicates its change; also when He promises that it shall be followed by an eternal one. For by Isaiah He says: \"Hear me, and ye shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you,\" adding \"the sure mercies of David,\"[fn-52-P5258_1642871:24-nf] in order that He might show that that covenant was to run its course in Christ. That He was of the family of David, according to the genealogy of Mary,[fn-52-P5259_1643040:25-nf] He declared in a figurative way even by the rod which was to proceed out of the stem of Jesse.[fn-52-P5260_1643581:26-nf] Forasmuch then as he said, that from the Creator there would come other laws, and other words, and new dispensations of covenants, indicating also that the very sacrifices were to receive higher offices, and that amongst all nations, by Malachi when he says: \"I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord, neither will I accept your sacrifices at your hands. For from the rising of the sun, even unto the going down of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place a sacrifice is offered unto my name, even a pure offering\"[fn-52-P5261_1644145:27-nf] -meaning simple prayer from a pure conscience,-it is of necessity that every change which comes as the result of innovation, introduces a diversity in those things of which the change is made, from which diversity arises also a contrariety. For as there is nothing, after it has undergone a change, which does not become different, so there is nothing different which is not contrary.[fn-52-P5262_1644551:28-nf] Of that very thing, therefore, there will be predicated a contrariety in consequence of its diversity, to which there accrued a change of condition after an innovation. He who brought about the change, the same instituted the diversity also; He who foretold the innovation, the same announced beforehand the contrariety likewise. Why, in your interpretation, do you impute a difference in the state of things to a difference of powers? Why do you wrest to the Creator's prejudice those examples from which you draw your antitheses, when you may recognise them all in His sensations and affections? \"I will wound,\" He says, \"and I will heal; \"\"I will kill,\" He says again, \"and I will make alive\"[fn-52-P5263_1645272:29-nf] -even the same \"who createth evil and maketh peace; \"[fn-52-P5264_1645349:30-nf] from which you are used even to censure Him with the imputation of fickleness and inconstancy, as if He forbade what He commanded, and commanded what He forbade. Why, then, have you not reckoned up the Antitheses also which occur in the natural works of the Creator, who is for ever contrary to Himself? You have not been able, unless I am misinformed, to recognise the fact,[fn-52-P5265_1645743:31-nf] that the world, at all events,[fn-52-P5266_1645791:32-nf] even amongst your people of Pontus, is made up of a diversity of elements which are hostile to one another.[fn-52-P5267_1645912:33-nf] It was therefore your bounden duty first to have determined that the god of the light was one being, and the god of darkness was another, in such wise that you might have been able to have distinctly asserted one of them to be the god of the law and the other the god of the gospel. It is, however, the settled conviction already[fn-52-P5268_1646266:34-nf] of my mind from manifest proofs, that, as His works and plans[fn-52-P5269_1646352:35-nf] exist in the way of Antitheses, so also by the same rule exist the mysteries of His religion.[fn-52-P5270_1646474:36-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":55,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"80","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In Genesis: \"And the Lord God said unto Abraham, Go out from thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, and go into that land which I shall show thee: and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and I will magnify thy name; and thou shalt be blessed: and I will bless him that blesseth thee, and I will curse him that curseth thee. and in thee shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed.\"[fn-80-P8063_2689475:83-nf] On this same point in Genesis: \"And Isaac blessed Jacob.[fn-80-P8064_2689551:84-nf] Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of a plentiful field which the Lord hath blessed: and God give thee of the dew of heaven, and of the fertility of the earth, abundance of corn, and wine, and oil: and peoples shall obey thee, and princes shall worship thee: and thou shalt be lord over thy brother, and the sons of thy father shall worship thee; and he that curseth thee shall be cursed, and he that blesseth thee shall be blessed.\"[fn-80-P8065_2690059:85-nf] On this matter too in Genesis: \"But when Joseph saw that his father placed his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it seemed displeasing to him: and Joseph laid hold of his father's hand, to lift it from the head of Ephraim on to the head of Manasseh.

But if they persisted in their wicked deeds, He forewarned them that they should be delivered into subjection to all the kingdoms of the earth; and that this has already happened them is manifest. Concerning repentance, then, Isaiah the prophet, generally indeed to all, but expressly to the people, says: \"Seek ye the Lord while He may be found, call ye upon Him while He is near: let the wicked forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord his God, and he will find mercy, for He will abundantly pardon.\"[fn-20-P2009_539461:14-nf] And another prophet, Ezekiel, says: \"If the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all My statutes, and do that which is right in My sight, he shall surely live, he shall not die.

But the cisterns which you have dug for yourselves are broken and profitless to you. For what is the use of that baptism which cleanses the flesh and body alone? Baptize the soul from wrath and from covetousness, from envy, and from hatred; and, lo! the body is pure. For this is the symbolic significance of unleavened bread, that you do not commit the old deeds of wicked leaven. But you have understood all things in a carnal sense, and you suppose it to be piety if you do such things, while your souls are filled with deceit, and, in short, with every wickedness. Accordingly, also, after the seven days of eating unleavened bread, God commanded them to mingle new leaven, that is, the performance of other works, and not the imitation of the old and evil works. And because this is what this new Lawgiver demands of you, I shall again refer to the words which have been quoted by me, and to others also which have been passed over. They are related by Isaiah to the following effect: `Hearken to me, and your soul shall live; and I will make with you an everlasting covenant, even the sure mercies of David. Behold, I have given Him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the nations. Nations which know not Thee shall call on Thee; and peoples who know not Thee shall escape unto Thee, because of Thy God, the Holy One of Israel, for He has glorified Thee. Seek ye God; and when you find Him, call on Him, so long as He may be nigh you. Let the wicked forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, and he will obtain mercy, because He will abundantly pardon your sins. For my thoughts are not as your thoughts, neither are my ways as your ways; but as far removed as the heavens are from the earth, so far is my way removed from your way, and your thoughts from my thoughts. For as the snow or the rain descends from heaven, and shall not return till it waters the earth, and makes it bring forth and bud, and gives seed to the sower and bread for food, so shall My word be that goeth forth out of My mouth: it shall not return until it shall have accomplished all that I desired, and I shall make My commandments prosperous. For ye shall go out with joy, and be taught with gladness. For the mountains and the hills shall leap while they expect you, and all the trees of the fields shall applaud with their branches: and instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle. And the Lord shall be for a name, and for an everlasting sign, and He shall not fail!'[fn-41-P4191_828567:32-nf] Of these and such like words written by the prophets, O Trypho,\" said I, \"some have reference to the first advent of Christ, in which He is preached as inglorious, obscure, and of mortal appearance: but others had reference to His second advent, when He shall appear in glory and above the clouds; and your nation shall see and know Him whom they have pierced, as Hosea, one of the twelve prophets, and Daniel, foretold.","title":"Dialogue of Justin","author":"Justin Martyr"},{"chapter":55,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_38_letter_of_an_inquirer_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"16","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"§11.

You ought, O men, when reflecting on the Good, to have brought forward a witness inborn and competent, viz, faith, which of itself, and from its own resources, chooses at once what is best, instead of occupying yourselves in painfully inquiring whether what is best ought to be followed. For, allow me to tell you, you ought to doubt whether you should get drunk, but you get drunk before reflecting on the matter; and whether you ought to do an injury, but you do injury with the utmost readiness. The only thing you make the subject of question is, whether God should be worshipped, and whether this wise God and Christ should be followed: and this you think requires deliberation and doubt, and know not what is worthy of God. Have faith in us, as you have in drunkenness, that you may be wise; have faith in us, as you have in injury, that you may live. But if, acknowledging the conspicuous trustworthiness of the virtues, you wish to trust them, come and I will set before you in abundance, materials of persuasion respecting the Word. But do you-for your ancestral customs, by which your minds are preoccupied, divert you from the truth,-do you now hear what is the real state of the case as follows.","title":"Exhortation to the Heathen","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":55,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_138_a_treatise_of_novatian_concerning_the_trinity_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"ANF-05","text":"The same rule of truth teaches us to believe, after the Father, also on the Son of God, Christ Jesus, the Lord our God, but the Son of God-of that God who is both one and alone, to wit the Founder of all things, as already has been expressed above.
