What the fruits are by the finding of which we may know an evil tree, the apostle tells us: \"Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; adulteries, fornications, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatreds, variances, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.\" And what the fruits are by which we may know a good tree, the very same apostle goes on to tell us: \"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.\"[fn-9-P941_367902:226-nf] It must be known, indeed, that \"joy\" stands here in a strict and proper sense; for bad men are, strictly speaking, not said to rejoice, but to make extravagant demonstrations of joy: just as we have said above, that \"will\" which the wicked do not possess, stands in a strict sense where it is said, \"All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.\" In accordance with that strict sense of the word, in virtue of which joy is spoken of only in the good, the prophet also speaks, saying: \"Rejoicing is not for the wicked, saith the Lord.\"[fn-9-P942_368494:227-nf] So also \"faith\" stands, not certainly as meaning any kind of it, but true faith: and the other things which find a place here have certain resemblances of their own in bad men and deceivers; so that they entirely mislead, unless one has the pure and single eye by which he may know such things. It is accordingly the best arrangement, that the cleansing of the eye is first discussed, and then mention is made of what things were to be guarded against.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":57,"verse":20,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_100_the_canonical_epistle","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"35","folder":"ANF-06","text":"To those who are altogether reprobate, and unrepentant, who possess the Ethiopian's unchanging skin,[fn-43-P4347_1299447:7-nf] and the leopard's spots, it shall be said, as it was spoken to another fig-tree, \"Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever; and it presently withered away.\"[fn-43-P4348_1299628:8-nf] For in them is fulfilled what was spoken by the Preacher: \"That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.\"[fn-43-P4349_1299799:9-nf] For unless that which is crooked shall first he made straight, it is impossible for it to be adorned; and unless that which is wanting shall first be made up, it cannot be numbered.

For such is the loving-kindness of God; He never turns his face away from a sincere repentance, but if any one has pushed on to the very extremity of wickedness, and chooses to return thence towards the path of virtue, God accepts and welcomes, and does everything so as to restore him to his former position. And He does what is yet more merciful; for even should any one not manifest complete repentance, he does not pass by one which is small and insignificant, but assigns a great reward even to this; which is evident from what Esaias the prophet says concerning the people of the Jews, speaking on this wise: \"On account of his sin I put him to pain for a little while, and smote him, and turned my face away from him, and he was pained, and walked sorrowfully, and then I healed him, and comforted him.\"[fn-6-P622_350222:13-nf] And we might cite as another witness that most ungodly king, who was given over to sin by the influence of his wife: yet when he only sorrowed, and put on sackcloth, and condemned his offences, he so won for himself the mercy of God, as to be released from all the evils which were impending over him. For God said to Elias \"Seest thou how Ahab is pricked in the heart before my face? I will not bring the evil upon him in his own days, because he hath wept before me.\"[fn-6-P623_350817:14-nf] And after this again, Manasses, having exceeded all in fury and tyranny, and having subverted the legal form of worship, and shut up the temple, and caused the deceit of idolatry to flourish, and having become more ungodly than all who were before him, when he afterwards repented, was ranked amongst the friends of God. Now if, looking to the magnitude of his own iniquities, he had despaired of restoration and repentance, he would have missed all which he afterwards obtained: but as it was, looking to the boundlessness of God's tender mercy instead of the enormity of his transgressions, and having broken in sunder the bonds of the devil, he rose up and contended with him, and finished the good course.[fn-6-P624_351614:15-nf] And not only by what was done to these men, but also by the words of the prophet does God destroy the counsels of despair, speaking. on this wise: \"To-day, if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.\"[fn-6-P625_351876:16-nf] Now that expression \"to-day,\" may be uttered at every time of life, even on the verge of old age, if you desire it: for repentance is judged not by quantity of time, but by disposition of the soul. For the Ninevites did not need many days to blot out their sin, but the short space of one day availed to efface all their iniquity: and the robber also did not take a long time to effect his entrance into Paradise, but in such a brief moment as one might occupy in uttering a single word, did he wash off all the sins which he had committed in his whole life, and received the prize bestowed by the divine approval even before the Apostles. And we also see the martyrs obtain glorious crowns for themselves in the course, not of many years, but of a few days, and often in a single day only.","title":"Letter I.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":57,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_19_an_answer_to_the_jews_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"117","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Now, if the hardness of your heart shall persist in rejecting and deriding all these interpretations, we will prove that it may suffice that the death of the Christ had been prophesied, in order that, from the fact that the nature of the death had not been specified, it may be understood to have been affected by means of the cross[fn-23-P2365_776780:229-nf] and that the passion of the cross is not to be ascribed to any but Him whose death was constantly being predicted. For I desire to show, in one utterance of Isaiah, His death, and passion, and sepulture. \"By the crimes,\" he says, \"of my people was He led unto death; and I will give the evil for His sepulture, and the rich for His death, because He did not wickedness, nor was guile found in his mouth; and God willed to redeem His soul from death,\"[fn-23-P2366_777353:230-nf] and so forth. He says again, moreover: \"His sepulture hath been taken away from the midst.\"[fn-23-P2367_777484:231-nf] For neither was He buried except He were dead, nor was His sepulture removed from the midst except through His resurrection. Finally, he subjoins: \"Therefore He shall have many for an heritage, and of many shall He divide spoils:[fn-23-P2368_777745:232-nf] \" who else (shall so do) but He who \"was born,\" as we have above shown?-\"in return for the fact that His soul was delivered unto death? \"For, the cause of the favour accorded Him being shown,-in return, to wit, for the injury of a death which had to be recompensed,-it is likewise shown that He, destined to attain these rewards because of death, was to attain them after death-of course after resurrection. For that which happened at His passion, that mid-day grew dark, the prophet Amos announces, saying, \"And it shall be,\" he says, \"in that day, saith the Lord, the sun shall set at mid-day, and the day of light shall grow dark over the land: and I will convert your festive days into grief, and all your canticles into lamentation; and I will lay upon your loins sackcloth, and upon every head baldness; and I will make the grief like that for a beloved (son), and them that are with him like a day of mourning.\"[fn-23-P2369_778766:233-nf] For that you would do thus at the beginning of the first month of your new (years) even Moses prophesied, when he was foretelling that all the community of the sons of lsrÂµl was[fn-23-P2370_778998:234-nf] to immolate at eventide a lamb, and were to eat[fn-23-P2371_779106:235-nf] this solemn sacrifice of this day (that is, of the passover of unleavened bread) with bitterness; \"and added that \"it was the passover of the Lord,\"[fn-23-P2372_779341:236-nf] that is, the passion of Christ. Which prediction was thus also fulfilled, that \"on the first day of unleavened bread\"[fn-23-P2373_779486:237-nf] you slew Christ;[fn-23-P2374_779574:238-nf] and (that the prophecies might be fulfilled) the day hasted to make an \"eventide,\"-that is, to cause darkness, which was made at mid-day; and thus \"your festive days God converted into grief, and your canticles into lamentation.\" For after the passion of Christ there overtook you even captivity and dispersion, predicted before through the Holy Spirit.","title":"An Answer to the Jews.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":57,"verse":16,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_22_a_treatise_on_the_soul_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"86","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But the nature of my present inquiry obliges me to call the soul spirit or breath, because to breathe is ascribed to another substance. We, however, claim this (operation) for the soul, which we acknowledge to be an indivisible simple substance, and therefore we must call it spirit in a definitive sense-not because of its condition, but of its action; not in respect of its nature, but of its operation; because it respires, and not because it is spirit in any especial sense.[fn-26-P2671_891545:73-nf] For to blow or breathe is to respire. So that we are driven to describe, by (the term which indicates this respiration-that is to say) spirit-the soul which we hold to be, by the propriety of its action, breath. Moreover, we properly and especially insist on calling it breath (or spirit), in opposition to Hermogenes, who derives the soul from matter instead of from the afflatus or breath of God. He, to be sure, goes flatly against the testimony of Scripture, and with this view converts breath into spirit, because he cannot believe that the (creature on which was breathed the) Spirit of God fell into sin, and then into condemnation; and therefore he would conclude that the soul came from matter rather than from the Spirit or breath of God. For this reason, we on our side even from that passage, maintain the soul to be breath and not the spirit, in the scriptural and distinctive sense of the spirit; and here it is with regret that we apply the term spirit at all in the lower sense, in consequence of the identical action of respiring and breathing. In that passage, the only question is about the natural substance; to respire being an act of nature. I would not tarry a moment longer on this point, were it not for those heretics who introduce into the soul some spiritual germ which passes my comprehension: (they make it to have been) conferred upon the soul by the secret liberality of her mother Sophia (Wisdom), without the knowledge of the Creator.[fn-26-P2672_893054:74-nf] But (Holy) Scripture, which has a better knowledge of the soul's Maker, or rather God, has told us nothing more than that God breathed on man's face the breath of life, and that man became a living soul, by means of which he was both to live and breathe; at the same time making a sufficiently clear distinction between the spirit and the soul,[fn-26-P2673_893449:75-nf] in such passages as the following, wherein God Himself declares: \"My Spirit went forth from me, and I made the breath of each. And the breath of my Spirit became soul.\"[fn-26-P2674_893725:76-nf] And again: \"He giveth breath unto the people that are on the earth, and Spirit to them that walk thereon.\"[fn-26-P2675_893876:77-nf] First of all there comes the (natural) soul, that is to say, the breath, to the people that are on the earth,-in other words, to those who act carnally in the flesh; then afterwards comes the Spirit to those who walk thereon,-that is, who subdue the works of the flesh; because the apostle also says, that \"that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural, (or in possession of the natural soul, ) and afterward that which is spiritual.\"[fn-26-P2676_894348:78-nf] For, inasmuch as Adam straightway predicted that \"great mystery of Christ and the church,\"[fn-26-P2677_894459:79-nf] when he said, \"This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they two shall become one flesh,\"[fn-26-P2678_894673:80-nf] he experienced the influence of the Spirit. For there fell upon him that ecstasy, which is the Holy Ghost's operative virtue of prophecy. And even the evil spirit too is an influence which comes upon a man. Indeed, the Spirit of God not more really \"turned Saul into another man,\"[fn-26-P2679_894976:81-nf] that is to say, into a prophet, when \"people said one to another, What is this which is come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets? \"[fn-26-P2680_895142:82-nf] than did the evil spirit afterwards turn him into another man-in other words, into an apostate. Judas likewise was for a long time reckoned among the elect (apostles), and was even appointed to the office of their treasurer; he was not yet the traitor, although he was become fraudulent; but afterwards the devil entered into him. Consequently, as the spirit neither of God nor of the devil is naturally planted with a man's soul at his birth, this soul must evidently exist apart and alone, previous to the accession to it of either spirit: if thus apart and alone, it must also be simple and un-compounded as regards its substance; and therefore it cannot respire from any other cause than from the actual condition of its own substance.","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":57,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_20_book_xiv_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"69","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Those emotions which the Greeks call eu0paqei/ai, and which Cicero calls constantioe, the Stoics would restrict to three; and, instead of three \"perturbations\" in the soul of the wise man, they substituted severally, in place of desire, will; in place of joy, contentment; and for fear, caution; and as to sickness or pain, which we, to avoid ambiguity, preferred to call sorrow, they denied that it could exist in the mind of a wise man. Will, they say, seeks the good, for this the wise man does. Contentment has its object in good that is possessed, and this the wise man continually possesses. Caution avoids evil, and this the wise man ought to avoid. But sorrow arises from evil that has already happened; and as they suppose that no evil can happen to the wise man, there can be no representative of sorrow in his mind. According to them, therefore, none but the wise man wills, is contented, uses caution; and that the fool can do no more than desire, rejoice, fear, be sad. The former three affections Cicero calls constantioe, the last four perturbationes. Many, however, calls these last passions; and, as I have said, the Greeks call the former eu0paqei/ai, and the latter pa/qh. And when I made a careful examination of Scripture to find whether this terminology was sanctioned by it, I came upon this saying of the prophet: \"There is no contentment to the wicked, saith the Lord;\"[fn-23-P2361_1327276:40-nf] as if the wicked might more properly rejoice than be contented regarding evils, for contentment is the property of the good and godly. I found also that verse in the Gospel: \"Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so unto them:[fn-23-P2362_1327546:41-nf] which seems to imply that evil or shameful things may be the object of desire, but not of will. Indeed, some interpreters have added \"good things,\" to make the expression more in conformity with customary usage, and have given this meaning, \"Whatsoever good deeds that ye would that men should do unto you.\" For they thought that this would prevent any one from wishing other men to provide him with unseemly, not to say shameful gratifications,-luxurious banquets, for example,-on the supposition that if he returned the like to them he would be fulfilling this precept. In the Greek Gospel, however, from which the Latin is translated, \"good\" does not occur, but only, \"All things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so unto them,\" and, as I believe, because \"good\" is already included in the word \"would;\" for He does not say \"desire.\"","title":"Book XIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":57,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_18_lecture_xiii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"16","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"15.

To help forward this beneficent, not onerous, purpose of the law, the prophets were also ordained by the self-same goodness of God, teaching precepts worthy of God, how that men should \"cease to do evil, learn to do well, seek judgment, judge the fatherless,[fn-45-P4562_1469444:233-nf] and plead for the widow: \"[fn-45-P4563_1469487:234-nf] be fond of the divine expostulations:[fn-45-P4564_1469547:235-nf] avoid contact with the wicked:[fn-45-P4565_1469664:236-nf] \"let the oppressed go free: \"[fn-45-P4566_1469760:237-nf] dismiss the unjust sentence.[fn-45-P4567_1469811:238-nf] \"deal their bread to the hungry; bring the outcast into their house; cover the naked, when they see him; nor hide themselves from their own flesh and kin: \"[fn-45-P4568_1470059:239-nf] \"keep their tongue from evil, and their lips from speaking guile: depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it: \"[fn-45-P4569_1470261:240-nf] be angry, and sin not; that is, not persevere in anger, or be enraged:[fn-45-P4570_1470357:241-nf] \"walk not in the counsel of the ungodly; nor stand in the way of sinners; nor sit in the seat of the scornful.\"[fn-45-P4571_1470493:242-nf] Where then? \"Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity; \"[fn-45-P4572_1470606:243-nf] meditating (as they do) day and night in the law of the Lord, because \"it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man; better to hope in the Lord than in man.\"[fn-45-P4573_1470806:244-nf] For what recompense shall man receive from God? \"He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither, and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.\"[fn-45-P4574_1471050:245-nf] \"He that hath clean hands and a pure heart, who hath not taken God's name in vain, nor sworn deceitfully to his neighbour, he shall receive blessing from the Lord, and mercy from the God of his salvation.\"[fn-45-P4575_1471273:246-nf] \"For the eyes of the Lord are upon them that fear Him, upon them that hope in His mercy, to deliver their souls from death,\" even eternal death, \"and to nourish them in their hunger,\" that is, after eternal life.[fn-45-P4576_1471547:247-nf] \"Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivereth them out of them all.\"[fn-45-P4577_1471682:248-nf] \"Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.\"[fn-45-P4578_1471768:249-nf] \"The Lord keepeth all their bones; not one of them shall be broken.\"[fn-45-P4579_1471858:250-nf] The Lord will redeem the souls of His servants.[fn-45-P4580_1471938:251-nf] We have adduced these few quotations from a mass of the Creator's Scriptures; and no more, I suppose, are wanted to prove Him to be a most good God, for they sufficiently indicate both the precepts of His goodness and the first-fruits[fn-45-P4581_1472195:252-nf] thereof.","title":"Book II.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":57,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_30_book_iii_","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"71","folder":"ANF-03","text":"You have the work of the apostles also predicted: \"How beautiful are the feet of them which preach the gospel of peace, which bring good tidings of good,\"[fn-51-P5141_1615228:309-nf] not of war nor evil tidings. In response to which is the psalm, \"Their sound is gone through all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world; \"[fn-51-P5142_1615415:310-nf] that is, the words of them who carry round about the law that proceeded from Sion and the Lord's word from Jerusalem, in order that that might come to pass which was written: \"They who were far from my righteousness, have come near to my righteousness and truth.\"[fn-51-P5143_1615698:311-nf] When the apostles girded their loins for this business, they renounced the elders and rulers and priests of the Jews. Well, says he, but was it not above all things that they might preach the other god? Rather[fn-51-P5144_1616043:312-nf] (that they might preach) that very self-same God, whose scripture they were with all their might fulfilling! \"Depart ye, depart ye,\" exclaims Isaiah; \"go ye out from thence, and touch not the unclean thing,\" that is blasphemy against Christ; \"Go ye out of the midst of her,\" even of the synagogue\" Be ye separate who bear the vessels of the Lord.\"[fn-51-P5145_1616406:313-nf] For already had the Lord, according to the preceding words (of the prophet), revealed His Holy One with His arm, that is to say, Christ by His mighty power, in the eyes of the nations, so that all the[fn-51-P5146_1616628:314-nf] nations and the utmost parts of the earth have seen the salvation, which was from God. By thus departing from Judaism itself, when they exchanged the obligations and burdens of the law for the liberty of the gospel, they were fulfilling the psalm, \"Let us burst their bonds asunder, and cast away their yoke from us; \"and this indeed (they did) after that \"the heathen raged, and the people imagined vain devices; \"after that \"the kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers took their counsel together against the Lord, and against His Christ.\"[fn-51-P5147_1617197:315-nf] What did the apostles thereupon suffer? You answer: Every sort of iniquitous persecutions, from men that belonged indeed to that Creator who was the adversary of Him whom they were preaching. Then why does the Creator, if an adversary of Christ, not only predict that the apostles should incur this suffering, but even express His displeasure[fn-51-P5148_1617587:316-nf] thereat? For He ought neither to predict the course of the other god, whom, as you contend, He knew not, nor to have expressed displeasure at that which He had taken care to bring about. \"See how the righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and how merciful men are taken away, and no man considereth. For the righteous man has been removed from the evil person.\"[fn-51-P5149_1617980:317-nf] Who is this but Christ? \"Come, say they, let us take away the righteous, because He is not for our turn, (and He is clean contrary to our doings).\"[fn-51-P5150_1618149:318-nf] Premising, therefore, and likewise subjoining the fact that Christ suffered, He foretold that His just ones should suffer equally with Him-both the apostles and all the faithful in succession; and He signed them with that very seal of which Ezekiel spake: \"The Lord said unto me, Go through the gate, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set the mark <i>tau upon the foreheads of the men.\"[fn-51-P5151_1618567:319-nf] Now the Greek letter <i>tau and our own letter T is the very form of the cross, which He predicted would be the sign on our foreheads in the true Catholic Jerusalem,[fn-51-P5152_1619095:320-nf] in which, according to the twenty-first Psalm, the brethren of Christ or children of God would ascribe glory to God the Father, in the person of Christ Himself addressing His Father; \"I will declare Thy name unto my brethren; in the midst of the congregation will I sing praise unto Thee.\" For that which had to come to pass in our day in His name, and by His Spirit, He rightly foretold would be of Him. And a little afterwards He says: \"My praise shall be of Thee in the great congregation.\"[fn-51-P5153_1619694:321-nf] In the sixty-seventh Psalm He says again: \"In the congregations bless ye the Lord God.\"[fn-51-P5154_1619807:322-nf] So that with this agrees also the prophecy of Malachi: \"I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord; neither will I accept your offerings: for from the rising of the sun, even unto the going down of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place sacrifice shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering\"[fn-51-P5155_1620161:323-nf] -such as the ascription of glory, and blessing, and praise, and hymns. Now, inasmuch as all these things are also found amongst you, and the sign upon the forehead,[fn-51-P5156_1620349:324-nf] and the sacraments of the church, and the offerings of the pure sacrifice, you ought now to burst forth, and declare that the Spirit of the Creator prophesied of your Christ.","title":"Book III.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":57,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":30,"source_paragraph":"106","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Justly, therefore, was the hypocrisy of the Pharisees displeasing to Him, loving God as they did with their lips, but not with their heart. \"Beware,\" He says to the disciples, \"of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy,\" not the proclamation of the Creator. The Son hates those who refused obedience[fn-64-P6458_1904078:1138-nf] to the Father; nor does He wish His disciples to show such a disposition towards Him-not (let it be observed) towards another god, against whom such hypocrisy indeed might have been admissible, as that which He wished to guard His disciples against. It is the example of the Pharisees which He forbids. It was in respect of Him against whom the Pharisees were sinning that (Christ) now forbade His disciples to offend. Since, then, He had censured their hypocrisy, which covered the secrets of the heart, and obscured with superficial offices the mysteries of unbelief, because (while holding the key of knowledge) it would neither enter in itself, nor permit others to enter in, He therefore adds, \"There is nothing covered that shall not be revealed; neither hid, which shall not be known,\"[fn-64-P6459_1904892:1139-nf] in order that no one should suppose that He was attempting the revelation and the recognition of an hitherto unknown and hidden god. When He remarks also on their murmurs and taunts, in saying of Him, \"This man casteth out devils only through Beelzebub,\" He means that all these imputations would come forth to the light of day, and be in the mouths of men in consequence of the promulgation of the Gospel. He then turns to His disciples with these words, \"I say unto you, my friends, Be not afraid of them which can only kill the body, and after that have no more power over you.\"[fn-64-P6460_1905496:1140-nf] They will, however, find Isaiah had already said, \"See how the just man is taken away, and no man layeth it to heart.\"[fn-64-P6461_1905637:1141-nf] \"But I will show you whom ye shall fear: fear Him who, after He hath killed, hath power to cast into hell\" (meaning, of course, the Creator); \"yea, I say unto you, fear Him.\"[fn-64-P6462_1905836:1142-nf] Now, it would here be enough for my purpose that He forbids offence being given to Him whom He orders to be feared; and that He orders Him to be respected[fn-64-P6463_1906013:1143-nf] whom He forbids to be offended; and that He who gives these commands belongs to that very God for whom He procures this fear, this absence of offence, and this respect. But this conclusion I can draw also from the following words: \"For I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before God.\"[fn-64-P6464_1906360:1144-nf] Now they who shall confess Christ will have to be slain[fn-64-P6465_1906438:1145-nf] before men, but they will have nothing more to suffer after they have been put to death by them. These therefore will be they whom He forewarns above not to be afraid of being only killed; and this forewarning He offers, in order that He might subjoin a clause on the necessity of confessing Him: \"Every one that denieth me before men shall be denied before God\"[fn-64-P6466_1906827:1146-nf] -by Him, of course, who would have confessed him, if he had only confessed God. Now, He who will confess the confessor is the very same God who will also deny the denier of Himself. Again, if it is the confessor who will have nothing to fear after his violent death,[fn-64-P6467_1907116:1147-nf] it is the denier to whom everything will become fearful after his natural death. Since, therefore, that which will have to be feared after death, even the punishment of hell, belongs to the Creator, the denier, too, belongs to the Creator. As with the denier, however, so with the confessor: if he should deny God, he will plainly have to suffer from God, although from men he had nothing more to suffer after they had put him to death. And so Christ is the Creator's, because He shows that all those who deny Him ought to fear the Creator's hell. After deterring His disciples from denial of Himself, He adds an admonition to fear blasphemy: \"Whosoever shall speak against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him.\"[fn-64-P6468_1907939:1148-nf] Now, if both the remission and the retention of sin savour of a judicial God, the Holy Ghost, who is not to be blasphemed, will belong to Him, who will not forgive the, blasphemy; just as He who, in the preceding passage, was not to be denied, belonged to, Him who would, after He had killed, also cast into hell. Now, since it is Christ who averts blasphemy from the Creator, I am at a loss to know in what manner His adversary.[fn-64-P6469_1908392:1149-nf] could have come. Else, if by these sayings He throws a black cloud of censure[fn-64-P6470_1908532:1150-nf] over the severity of Him who will not forgive blasphemy and will kill even to hell, it follows that the very spirit of that rival god may be blasphemed with impunity, and his Christ denied; and that there is no difference, in fact, between worshipping and despising him; but that, as there is no punishment for the contempt, so there is no reward for the worship, which men need expect. When \"brought before magistrates,\" and examined, He forbids them \"to take thought how they shall answer; \"\"for,\" says He, \"the Holy Ghost shall teach you in that very hour what ye ought to say.\"[fn-64-P6471_1909133:1151-nf] If such an injunction[fn-64-P6472_1909182:1152-nf] as this comes from the Creator, the precept will only be His by whom an example was previously given. The prophet Balaam, in Numbers, when sent forth by king Balak to curse lsrÂµl, with whom he was commencing war, was at the same moment[fn-64-P6473_1909439:1153-nf] filled with the Spirit. Instead of the curse which he was come to pronounce, he uttered the blessing which the Spirit at that very hour inspired him with; having previously declared to the king's messengers, and then to the king himself, that he could only speak forth that which God should put into his mouth.[fn-64-P6474_1909766:1154-nf] The novel doctrines of the new Christ are such as the Creator's servants initiated long before! But see how clear a difference there is between the example of Moses and of Christ.[fn-64-P6475_1909972:1155-nf] Moses voluntarily interferes with brothers[fn-64-P6476_1910048:1156-nf] who were quarrelling, and chides the offender: \"Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? \"He is, however, rejected by him: \"Who made thee a prince or a judge over us? \"[fn-64-P6477_1910251:1157-nf] Christ, on the contrary, when requested by a certain man to compose a strife between him and his brother about dividing an inheritance, refused His assistance, although in so honest a cause. Well, then, my Moses is better than your Christ, aiming as he did at the peace of brethren, and obviating their wrong. But of course the case must be different with Christ, for he is the Christ of the simply good and non-judicial god. \"Who,\" says he, \"made me a judge over you? \"[fn-64-P6478_1910747:1158-nf] No other word of excuse was he able to find, without using[fn-64-P6479_1910834:1159-nf] that with which the wicked, man and impious brother had rejected[fn-64-P6480_1910921:1160-nf] the defender of probity and piety! In short, he approved of the excuse, although a bad one, by his use of it; and of the act, although a bad one, by his refusal to make peace between brothers. Or rather, would He not show His resentment[fn-64-P6481_1911222:1161-nf] at the rejection of Moses with such a word? And therefore did He not wish in a similar case of contentious brothers, to confound them with the recollection of so harsh a word? Clearly so. For He had Himself been present in Moses, who heard such a rejection-even He, the Spirit of the Creator.[fn-64-P6482_1911549:1162-nf] I think that we have already, in another passage,[fn-64-P6483_1911778:1163-nf] sufficiently shown that the glory of riches is condemned by our God, \"who putteth down the mighty from their throne, and exalts the poor from the dunghill.\"[fn-64-P6484_1911990:1164-nf] From Him, therefore, will proceed the parable of the rich man, who flattered himself about the increase of his fields, and to Whom God said: \"Thou fool, this night shall they require thy soul of thee; then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided? \"[fn-64-P6485_1912314:1165-nf] It was just in the like manner that the king Hezekiah heard from Isaiah the sad doom of his kingdom, when he gloried, before the envoys of Babylon,[fn-64-P6486_1912488:1166-nf] in his treasures and the deposits of his precious things.[fn-64-P6487_1912568:1167-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":57,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":45,"source_paragraph":"137","folder":"ANF-03","text":"It was very meet that the man who buried the Lord should thus be noticed in prophecy, and thenceforth be \"blessed; \"[fn-70-P7048_2043310:1682-nf] since prophecy does not omit the (pious) office of the women who resorted before day-break to the sepulchre with the spices which they had prepared.[fn-70-P7049_2043523:1683-nf] For of this incident it is said by Hosea: \"To seek my face they will watch till day-light, saying unto me, Come, and let us return to the Lord: for He hath taken away, and He will heal us; He hath smitten, and He will bind us up; after two days will He revive us: in the third day He will raise us up.\"[fn-70-P7050_2043849:1684-nf] For who can refuse to believe that these words often revolved[fn-70-P7051_2043945:1685-nf] in the thought of those women between the sorrow of that desertion with which at present they seemed to themselves to have been smitten by the Lord, and the hope of the resurrection itself, by which they rightly supposed that all would be restored to them? But when \"they found not the body (of the Lord Jesus),\"[fn-70-P7052_2044277:1686-nf] \"His sepulture was removed from the midst of them,\"[fn-70-P7053_2044352:1687-nf] according to the prophecy of Isaiah. \"Two angels however, appeared there.\"[fn-70-P7054_2044520:1688-nf] For just so many honorary companions[fn-70-P7055_2044580:1689-nf] were required by the word of God, which usually prescribes \"two witnesses.\"[fn-70-P7056_2044687:1690-nf] Moreover, the women, returning from the sepulchre, and from this vision of the angels, were foreseen by Isaiah, when he says, \"Come, ye women, who return from the vision; \"[fn-70-P7057_2044943:1691-nf] that is, \"come,\" to report the resurrection of the Lord. It was well, however, that the unbelief of the disciples was so persistent, in order that to the last we might consistently maintain that Jesus revealed Himself to the disciples as none other than the Christ of the prophets. For as two of them were taking a walk, and when the Lord had joined their company, without its appearing that it was He, and whilst He dissembled His knowledge of what had just taken place,[fn-70-P7058_2045512:1692-nf] they say: \"But we trusted that it had been He which should have redeemed Israel,\"[fn-70-P7059_2045621:1693-nf] -meaning their own, that is, the Creator's Christ. So far had He been from declaring Himself to them as another Christ! They could not, however, deem Him to be the Christ of the Creator; nor, if He was so deemed by them, could He have tolerated this opinion concerning Himself, unless He were really He whom He was supposed to be. Otherwise He would actually be the author of error, and the prevaricator of truth, contrary to the character of the good; God. But at no time even after His resurrection did He reveal Himself to them as any other than what, on their own showing, they had always thought Him to be. He pointedly[fn-70-P7060_2046270:1694-nf] reproached them: \"O fools, and slow of heart in not believing that which He spake unto you.\"[fn-70-P7061_2046379:1695-nf] By saying this, He proves that He does not belong to the rival god, but to the same God. For the same thing was said by the angels to the women: \"Remember how He spake unto you when He was yet in Galilee, saying, The Son of man must be delivered up, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.\"[fn-70-P7062_2046705:1696-nf] \"Must be delivered up; \"and why, except that it was so written by God the Creator? He therefore upbraided them, because they were offended solely at His passion, and because they doubted of the truth of the resurrection which had been reported to them by the women, whereby (they showed that) they had not believed Him to have been the very same as they had thought Him to be. Wishing, therefore, to be believed by them in this wise, He declared Himself to be just what they had deemed Him to be-the Creator's Christ, the Redeemer of lsrÂµl. But as touching the reality of His body, what can be plainer? When they were doubting whether He were not a phantom-nay, were supposing that He was one-He says to them, \"Why are ye troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? See[fn-70-P7063_2047508:1697-nf] my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; for a spirit hath not bones, as ye see me have.\"[fn-70-P7064_2047729:1698-nf] Now Marcion was unwilling to expunge from his Gospel some statements which even made against him-I suspect, on purpose, to have it in his power from the passages which he did not suppress, when he could have done so, either to deny that he had expunged anything, or else to justify his suppressions, if he made any. But he spares only such passages as he can subvert quite as well by explaining them away as by expunging them from the text. Thus, in the passage before us, he would have the words, \"A spirit hath not bones, as ye see me have,\" so transposed, as to mean, \"A spirit, such as ye see me to be, hath not bones; \"that is to say, it is not the nature of a spirit to have bones. But what need of so tortuous a construction, when He might have simply said, \"A spirit hath not bones, even as you observe that I have not? \"Why, moreover, does He offer His hands and His feet for their examination-limbs which consist of bones-if He had no bones? Why, too, does He add, \"Know that it is I myself,\"[fn-70-P7065_2048760:1699-nf] when they had before known Him to be corporeal? Else, if He were altogether a phantom, why did He upbraid them for supposing Him to be a phantom? But whilst they still believed not, He asked them for some meat,[fn-70-P7066_2048995:1700-nf] for the express purpose of showing them that He had teeth.[fn-70-P7067_2049078:1701-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":57,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_31_book_i_","source_chapter":23,"source_paragraph":"81","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"On the same principle we treat the passage in which God says: \"For my Spirit shall go forthfrom me; and I have created every breath.\"[fn-45-P4538_1734017:27-nf] Here the former clause, \"My Spirit shall go forth from me, must be taken as referring to the Holy Ghost, of whom the Saviour similarlysays, \"He proceedeth from the Father.\"[fn-45-P4539_1734309:28-nf] But the other clause, \"I have created every breath,\" is undeniably spoken of each individual soul.

Since the death of His own saints is precious is His sight, as David sings,[fn-110-P11033_3115822:50-nf] it is not, I think, that one which falls to the lot of men generally, and is a debt due by all (rather is that one even disgraceful on account of the trespass, and the desert of condemnation to which it is to be traced), but that other which is met in this very work-in bearing witness for religion, and maintaining the fight of confession in behalf of righteousness and the sacrament. As saith Esaias, \"See how the righteous man perisheth, and no one layeth it to heart; and righteous men are taken away, and no one considereth it: for from before the face of unrighteousness the righteous man perisheth, and he shall have honour at his burial.\"[fn-110-P11034_3116488:51-nf] Here, too, you have both an announcement of martyrdoms, and of the recompense they bring. From the beginning, indeed, righteousness suffers violence. Forthwith, as soon as God has begun to be worshipped, religion has got ill-will for her portion. He who had pleased God is slain, and that by his brother. Beginning with kindred blood, in order that it might the more easily go in quest of that of strangers, ungodliness made the object of its pursuit, finally, that not only of righteous persons, but even of prophets also. David is persecuted; Elias put to flight; Jeremias stoned; Esaias cut asunder; Zacharias butchered between the altar and the temple, imparting to the hard stones lasting marks of his blood.[fn-110-P11035_3117221:52-nf] That person himself, at the close of the law and the prophets, and called not a prophet, but a messenger, is, suffering an ignominious death, beheaded to reward a dancing-girl. And certainly they who were wont to be led by the Spirit of God used to be guided by Himself to martyrdoms; so that they had even already to endure what they had also proclaimed as requiring to be borne. Wherefore the brotherhood of the three also, when the dedication of the royal image was the occasion of the citizens being pressed to offer worship, knew well what faith, which alone in them had not been taken captive, required,-namely, that they must resist idolatry to the death.[fn-110-P11036_3117903:53-nf] For they remembered also the words of Jeremias writing to those over whom that captivity was impending: \"And now ye shall see borne upon (men's) shoulders the gods of the Babylonians, of gold and silver and wood, causing fear to the Gentiles. Beware, therefore, that ye also do not be altogether like the foreigners, and be seized with fear while ye behold crowds worshipping those gods before and behind, but say in your mind, Our duty is to worship Thee, O Lord.\"[fn-110-P11037_3118388:54-nf] Therefore, having got confidence from God, they said, when with strength of mind they set at defiance the king's threats against the disobedient: \"There is no necessity for our making answer to this command of yours. For our God whom we worship is able to deliver us from the furnace of fire and from your hands; and then it will be made plain to you that we shall neither serve your idol, nor worship your golden image which you have set up.\"[fn-110-P11038_3118851:55-nf] O martyrdom even without suffering perfect! Enough did they suffer! enough were they burned, whom on this account God shielded, that it might not seem that they had given a false representation of His power. For forthwith, certainly, would the lions, with their pent-up and wonted savageness, have devoured Daniel also, a worshipper of none but God, and therefore accused and demanded by the Chaldeans, if it had been right that the worthy anticipation of Darius concerning God should have proved delusive. For the rest, every preacher of God, and every worshipper also, such as, having been summoned to the service of idolatry, had refused compliance, ought to have suffered, agreeably to the tenor of that argument too, by which the truth ought to have been recommended both to those who were then living and to those following in succession,-(namely), that the suffering of its defenders themselves bespeak trust for it, because nobody would have been willing to be slain but one possessing the truth.

And then, they say, the events mentioned in this passage shall happen, just as if there was no fruit as yet from the words of the prophecy. O unreasoning men! understanding not what has been proved by all these passages, that two advents of Christ have been announced: the one, in which He is set forth as suffering, inglorious, dishonoured, and crucified; but the other, in which He shall come from heaven with glory, when the man of apostasy,[fn-49-P4980_1108288:420-nf] who speaks strange things against the Most High, shall venture to do unlawful deeds on the earth against us the Christians, who, having learned the true worship of God from the law, and the word which went forth from Jerusalem by means of the apostles of Jesus, have fled for safety to the God of Jacob and God of Israel; and we who were filled with war, and mutual slaughter, and every wickedness, have each through the whole earth changed our warlike weapons,-our swords into ploughshares, and our spears into implements of tillage,-and we cultivate piety, righteousness, philanthropy, faith, and hope, which we have from the Father Himself through Him who was crucified; and sitting each under his vine, i.e., each man possessing his own married wife.

For Just as if one should cut away the fruit-bearing parts of a vine, it grows up again, and yields other branches flourishing and fruitful; even so the same thing happens with us. For the vine planted by God and Christ the Saviour is His people. But the rest of the prophecy shall be fulfilled at His second coming. For the expression, `He that is afflicted [and driven out], 'i.e., from the world, [implies] that, so far as you and all other men have it in your power, each Christian has been driven out not only from his own property, but even from the whole world; for you permit no Christian to live.

Now, if you have been cast out after defeat in battle, you have suffered such treatment justly indeed, as all the Scriptures bear witness; but we, though we have done no such [evil acts] after we knew the truth of God, are testified to by God, that, together with the most righteous, and only spotless and sinless Christ, we are taken away out of the earth.

As elsewhere the same Prophet says: \"Truth has sprung from the earth and righteousness hath looked down from heaven,\"[fn-72-P7207_2625315:16-nf] that we may know that when the Son of God looked down from heaven (i.e., came and descended), righteousness was born of the flesh of the Virgin, no phantasm of a body, but the Truth: for He is the Truth, according to His own witness of Truth: \"I am the Truth and the life.\"[fn-72-P7208_2625610:17-nf] And so as we have proved in the earlier books that this Truth; viz., the Lord Jesus Christ, was God when born of the Virgin, let us now do as we determined to do in the book before this, and show that He who was to be born of the Virgin, was always declared to be God beforehand. And so the prophet Isaiah says, \"Cease ye from the man whose breath is in his nostrils, for it is He in whom he is reputed to be;\" or as it is more exactly and clearly in the Hebrew: \"for he is reputed high.\"[fn-72-P7209_2626158:18-nf] But by saying \"cease ye,\" a term which deprecates violence, he admirably denotes the disturbance of persecution. \"Cease ye,\" he says, \"from the man whose breath is in his nostrils, for he is reputed high.\" Does he not in one and the same sentence speak of the taking upon Him of the manhood, and the truth of His Godhead? \"Cease ye,\" he says, \"from the man whose breath is in his nostrils, for he is reputed high.\" Does he not, I ask you, seem plainly to address the Lord's persecutors, and to say, \"Cease ye from the man\" whom ye are persecuting, for this man is God: and though He appears in the lowliness of human flesh, yet He still continues in the high estate of Divine glory? But by saying \"Cease ye from the man whose breath is in his nostrils,\" he admirably showed His manhood, by the clearest tokens of a human body, and this fearlessly and confidently, as one who would as urgently assert the truth of His humanity as that of His Godhead, for this is the true and Catholic faith, to believe that the Lord Jesus Christ possessed the substance of a true body just as He possessed a true and perfect Divinity. Unless possibly you think that anything can be made out of the fact that he uses the word \"High\" instead of \"God\"; whereas it is the habit of holy Scripture to put \"High\" for \"God,\" as where the prophet says: \"the Most High uttered His voice and the earth was moved,\"[fn-72-P7210_2627569:19-nf] and \"Thou alone art Most High over all the earth.\"[fn-72-P7211_2627652:20-nf] Isaiah too, who says this: \"The High and lofty one who inhabit eth eternity\":[fn-72-P7212_2627751:21-nf] where we are clearly to understand that as he there puts Most High without adding the name of God, so here too he speaks of God by the name of Most High.

I was gravely and grievously disturbed, dearest brethren, at learning that Fortunatianus, formerly bishop among you, after the sad lapse of his fall, was now wishing to act as if he were sound, and beginning to claim for himself the episcopate. Which thing distressed me; in the first place, on his own account, who, wretched man that he is, being either wholly blinded in the darkness of the devil, or deceived by the sacrilegious persuasion of certain persons; when he ought to be making atonement, and to give himself to the work of entreating the Lord night and day, by tears, and supplications, and prayers, dares still to claim to himself the priesthood which he has betrayed, as if it were right, from the altars of the devil, to approach to the altar of God. Or as if he would not provoke a greater wrath and indignation of the Lord against himself in the day of judgment, who, not being able to be a guide to the brethren in faith and virtue, stands forth as a teacher in perfidy, in boldness, and in temerity; and he who has not taught the brethren to stand bravely in the battle, teaches those who are conquered and prostrate not even to ask for pardon; although the Lord says, \"To them have ye poured a drink-offering, and to them have ye offered a meat-offering.
