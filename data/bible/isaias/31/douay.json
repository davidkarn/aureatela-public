{"verses":["Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help, trusting in horses,\nand putting their confidence in chariots, because they are many:  and in\nhorsemen, because they are very strong:  and have not trusted in the\nHoly One of Israel, and have not sought after the Lord.","But he that is the wise one hath brought evil, and hath not\nremoved his words:  and he will rise up against the house of the wicked,\nand against the aid of them that work iniquity.","Egypt is man, and not God:  and their horses, flesh, and not\nspirit:  and the Lord shall put down his hand, and the helper shall\nfall, and he that is helped shall fall, and they shall all be\nconfounded together.","For thus saith the Lord to me:  Like as the lion roareth, and the\nlions whelp upon his prey, and when a multitude of shepherds shall come\nagainst him, he will not fear at their voice, nor be afraid of their\nmultitude:  so shall the Lord of hosts come down to fight upon mount\nSion, and upon the hill thereof.","As birds flying, so will the Lord of hosts protect Jerusalem,\nprotecting and delivering, passing over and saving.","Return as you had deeply revolted, O children of Israel.","For in that day a man shall cast away his idols of silver, and\nhis idols of gold, which your hands have made for you to sin.","And the Assyrian shall fall by the sword not of a man, and the\nsword not of a man shall devour him, and he shall flee not at the face\nof the sword, and his young men shall be tributaries.","And his strength shall pass away with dread, and his princes\nfleeing shall be afraid:  the Lord hath said it, whose fire is in Sion,\nand his furnace in Jerusalem."]}
