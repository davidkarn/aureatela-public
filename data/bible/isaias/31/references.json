The old law had a different ideal of blessedness, for therein it is said: \"Blessed is he who hath seed in Zion and a family in Jerusalem:\"[fn-7-P758_151979:480-nf] and \"Cursed is the barren who beareth not:\"[fn-7-P759_152049:481-nf] and \"Thy children shall be like olive-plants round about thy table.\"[fn-7-P760_152147:482-nf] Riches too are promised to the faithful and we are told that \"there was not one feeble person among their tribes.\"[fn-7-P761_152285:483-nf] But now even to eunuchs it is said, \"Say not, behold I am a dry tree,\"[fn-7-P762_152375:484-nf] for instead of sons and daughters you have a place forever in heaven. Now the poor are blessed, now Lazarus is set before Dives in his purple.[fn-7-P763_152538:485-nf] Now he who is weak is counted strong. But in those days the world was still unpeopled: accordingly, to pass over instances of childlessness meant only to serve as types, those only were considered happy who could boast of children. It was for this reason that Abraham in his old age married Keturah;[fn-7-P764_152867:486-nf] that Leah hired Jacob with her son's mandrakes,[fn-7-P765_152935:487-nf] and that fair Rachel-a type of the church-complained of the closing of her womb.[fn-7-P766_153040:488-nf] But gradually the crop grew up and then the reaper was sent forth with his sickle. Elijah lived a virgin life, so also did Elisha and many of the sons of the prophets. To Jeremiah the command came: \"Thou shall not take thee a wife.\"[fn-7-P767_153306:489-nf] He had been sanctified in his mother's womb,[fn-7-P768_153371:490-nf] and now he was forbidden to take a wife because the captivity was near. The apostle gives the same counsel in different words. \"I think, therefore, that this is good by reason of the present distress, namely that it is good for a man to be as he is.\"[fn-7-P769_153640:491-nf] What is this distress which does away with the joys of wedlock? The apostle tells us, in a later verse: \"The time is short: it remaineth that those who have wives be as though they had none.\"[fn-7-P770_153860:492-nf] Nebuchadnezzar is hard at hand. The lion is bestirring himself from his lair. What good will marriage be to me if it is to end in slavery to the haughtiest of kings? What good will little ones be to me if their lot is to be that which the prophet sadly describes: \"The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst; the young children ask for bread and no man breaketh it unto them\"?[fn-7-P771_154294:493-nf] In those days, as I have said, the virtue of continence was found only in men: Eve still continued to travail with children. But now that a virgin has conceived[fn-7-P772_154474:494-nf] in the womb and has borne to us a child of which the prophet says that \"Government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called the mighty God, the everlasting Father,\"[fn-7-P773_154676:495-nf] now the chain of the curse is broken. Death came through Eve, but life has come through Mary. And thus the gift of virginity has been bestowed most richly upon women, seeing that it has had its beginning from a woman. As soon as the Son of God set foot upon the earth, He formed for Himself a new household there; that, as He was adored by angels in heaven, angels might serve Him also on earth. Then chaste Judith once more cut off the head of Holofernes.[fn-7-P774_155152:496-nf] Then Haman-whose name means iniquity-was once more burned in fire of his own kindling.[fn-7-P775_155260:497-nf] Then James and John forsook father and net and ship and followed the Saviour: neither kinship nor the world's ties, nor the care of their home could hold them back. Then were the words heard: \"Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.\"[fn-7-P776_155565:498-nf] For no soldier goes with a wife to battle. Even when a disciple would have buried his father, the Lord forbade him, and said: \"Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man hath not where to lay His head.\"[fn-7-P777_155820:499-nf] So you must not complain if you have but scanty house-room. In the same strain, the apostle writes: \"He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord: but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world how he may please his wife. There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she that is married careth for the things of the world how she may please her husband.\"[fn-7-P778_156387:500-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":31,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"702","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"11. It would be tedious now to enumerate, what great additions and omissions the Septuagint has made, and all the passages which in church-copies are marked with daggers and asterisks. The Jews generally laugh when they hear our version of this passage of Isaiah, \"Blessed is he that hath seed in Zion and servants in Jerusalem.\"[fn-23-P2399_613405:1716-nf] In Amos also[fn-24-P2400_613446:1717-nf] after a description of self-indulgence[fn-24-P2401_613517:1718-nf] there come these words: \"They have thought of these things as halting and not likely to fly,\" a very rhetorical sentence quite worthy of Tully. But how shall we deal with the Hebrew originals in which these passages and others like them are omitted, passages so numerous that to reproduce them all would require books without number? The number of the omissions is shown alike by the asterisks mentioned above and by my own version when compared by a careful reader with the old translation.[fn-24-P2402_614032:1719-nf] Yet the Septuagint has rightly kept its place in the churches, either because it is the first of all the versions in time, made before the coming of Christ, or else because it has been used by the apostles (only however in places where it does not disagree with the Hebrews[fn-24-P2403_614534:1720-nf] ). On the other hand we do right to reject Aquila, the proselyte and controversial translator, who has striven to translate not words only but their etymologies as well. Who could accept as renderings of \"corn and wine and oil\"[fn-24-P2404_614817:1721-nf] such words as xeima opwrismo/j stilpno/thj, or, as we might say, `pouring,' and `fruitgathering,' and `shining'? or, because Hebrew has in addition to the article other prefixes[fn-24-P2405_615023:1722-nf] as well, he must with an unhappy pedantry translate syllable by, syllable and letter, by letter thus: sun ton ouranon kai thn ghn, a construction which neither Greek nor Latin admits of,[fn-24-P2406_615229:1723-nf] as many passages in our own writers shew.

How hard hearted we are and how merciful God is! who even after our many sins urges us to seek salvation. Yet not even so are we willing to turn to better things. Hear the words of the Lord: \"If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's and shall afterwards desire to return to him, will he at all receive her? Will he not loathe her rather? But thou hast played the harlot with many lovers: yet return again to me, saith the Lord.\" In place of the last clause the true Hebrew text (which is not preserved in the Greek and Latin versions) gives the following: \"thou hast forsaken me, yet return, and I will receive thee, saith the Lord.\"[fn-44-P4445_1209881:3153-nf] Isaiah also speaking in tim same sense uses almost the same words: \"Return,\" he cries, \"O children of Israel, ye who think deep counsel and wicked.[fn-44-P4446_1210207:3154-nf] Return thou unto me and I will redeem thee. I am God, and there is no God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me. Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth.[fn-44-P4447_1210434:3155-nf] Remember this and shew yourselves men: bring it again to mind, O ye transgressors. Return in heart and remember the former things of old: for I am God and there is none else.\"[fn-44-P4448_1210647:3156-nf] Joel also writes: \"turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting and with weeping and with mourning: and rend your heart and not your garments and turn unto the Lord your God; for he is gracious and merciful...and repenteth him of the evil.\"[fn-44-P4449_1210929:3157-nf] How great His mercy is and how excessive-if I may so say-and unspeakable is His pitifulness, the prophet Hosea tells us when he speaks in the Lord's name: \"how shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? How shall I set thee as Zeboim? Mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together. I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger.'[fn-44-P4450_1211371:3158-nf] David also says in a psalm: \"in death there is no remembrance of thee; in the grave who shall give thee thanks?\"[fn-44-P4451_1211517:3159-nf] and in another place: \"I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.\"[fn-44-P4452_1211890:3160-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":31,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_43_book_iii_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"76","folder":"ANF-02","text":"And when the people transgressed the law which had been given to them by God, God being good and pitiful, unwilling to destroy them, in addition to His giving them the law, afterwards sent forth also prophets to them from among their brethren, to teach and remind them of the contents of the law, and to turn them to repentance, that they might sin no more. But if they persisted in their wicked deeds, He forewarned them that they should be delivered into subjection to all the kingdoms of the earth; and that this has already happened them is manifest. Concerning repentance, then, Isaiah the prophet, generally indeed to all, but expressly to the people, says: \"Seek ye the Lord while He may be found, call ye upon Him while He is near: let the wicked forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord his God, and he will find mercy, for He will abundantly pardon.\"[fn-20-P2009_539461:14-nf] And another prophet, Ezekiel, says: \"If the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all My statutes, and do that which is right in My sight, he shall surely live, he shall not die. All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him; but in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live: for I desire not the death of the sinner, saith the Lord, but that he turn from his wicked way, and live.\"[fn-20-P2010_539937:15-nf] Again Isaiah: \"Ye who take deep and wicked counsel, turn ye, that ye may be saved.\"[fn-20-P2011_540043:16-nf] And another prophet, Jeremiah: \"Turn to the Lord your God, as a grape-gatherer to his basket, and ye shall find mercy.\"[fn-20-P2012_540182:17-nf] Many therefore, yea rather, countless are the sayings in the Holy Scriptures regarding repentance, God being always desirous that the race of men turn from all their sins.","title":"Book III.","author":"Theophilus of Antioch"},{"chapter":31,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_130_exhortation_to_repentance_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Also in Isaiah: \"Be ye converted, because ye devise a deep and wicked counsel.\"[fn-98-P9808_3072546:6-nf] ","title":"Exhortation to Repentance.","author":"Cyprian"},{"chapter":31,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_63_book_v_","source_chapter":36,"source_paragraph":"179","folder":"ANF-01","text":"4. Then again, speaking of Jerusalem, and of Him reigning there, Isaiah declares, \"Thus saith the Lord, Happy is he who hath seed in Zion, and servants in Jerusalem. Behold, a righteous king shall reign, and princes shall rule with judgment\"[fn-93-P9390_2753356:314-nf] And with regard to the foundation on which it shall be rebuilt, he says: \"Behold, I will lay in order for thee a carbuncle stone, and sapphire for thy foundations; and I will lay thy ramparts with jasper, and thy gates with crystal, and thy wall with choice stones: and all thy children shall be taught of God, and great shall be the peace of thy children; and in righteousness shalt thou be built up.\"[fn-93-P9391_2753790:315-nf] And yet again does he say the same thing: \"Behold, I make Jerusalem a rejoicing, and my people [a joy]; for the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying. Also there shall not be there any immature [one], nor an old man who does not fulfil his time: for the youth shall be of a hundred years; and the sinner shall die a hundred years old, yet shall be accursed. And they shall build houses, and inhabit them themselves; and shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them themselves, and shall drink wine.

The explanation of which though I know that it cannot be taught to or understood by the inexperienced, yet as far as I can, I will try to set forth in words and briefly to explain, if only your minds will follow up and act upon what we say. For whatever is known not by teaching but by experience, just as it cannot be taught by one without experience, so neither can it be grasped or taken in by the mind of one who has not laid the foundation by a similar study and training. And therefore I think it necessary for us first to inquire somewhat carefully what is the purpose or meaning of the law, and what is the system and perfection of grace, that from this we may succeed in understanding the dominion of sin and how to drive it out. And so the law chiefly commands men to seek the bonds of wedlock, saying: \"Blessed is he that hath seed in Sion and an household in Jerusalem;\"[fn-64-P6480_2315700:61-nf] and: \"Cursed is the barren that hath not borne.\"[fn-64-P6481_2315775:62-nf] On the other hand grace invites us to the purity of perpetual chastity, and the undefiled state of blessed virginity, saying: \"Blessed are the barren, and the breasts which have not given suck;\" and: \"he that hateth not father and mother and wife cannot be my disciple;\" and this of the Apostle: \"It remaineth that they that have wives be as though they had them not.\"[fn-64-P6482_2316167:63-nf] The law says: \"Thou shall not delay to offer thy tithes and firstfruits;\" grace says: \"If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell all that thou hast and give to the poor:\"[fn-64-P6483_2316382:64-nf] The law forbids not retaliation for wrongs and vengeance for injuries, saying\"\"An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\" Grace would have our patience proved by the injuries and blows offered to us being redoubled, and bids us be ready to endure twice as much damage; saying: \"If a man strike thee on one cheek, offer him the other also; and to him who will contend with thee at the law and take away thy coat, give him thy cloak also.\"[fn-64-P6484_2316860:65-nf] The one decrees that we should hate our enemies, the other that we should love them so that it holds that even for them we ought always to pray to God.","title":"XXI.
