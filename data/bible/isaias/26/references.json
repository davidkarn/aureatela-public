In the midst, then, of this great strife of my inner dwelling, which I had strongly raised up against my soul in the chamber of my heart,[fn-12-P1253_531593:75-nf] troubled both in mind and countenance, I seized upon Alypius, and exclaimed: \"What is wrong with us? What is this? What heardest thou? The unlearned start up and `take' heaven,[fn-12-P1254_531807:76-nf] and we, with our learning, but wanting heart, see where we wallow in flesh and blood!

There was a little garden belonging to our lodging, of which we had the use, as of the whole house; for the master, our landlord, did not live there. Thither had the tempest within my breast hurried me, where no one might impede the fiery struggle in which I was engaged with myself, until it came to the issue that Thou knewest, though I did not. But I was mad that I might be whole, and dying that I might have life, knowing what evil thing I was, but not knowing what good thing I was shortly to become. Into the garden, then, I retired, Alypius following my steps. For his presence was no bar to my solitude; or how could he desert me so troubled? We sat down at as great a distance from the house as we could. I was disquieted in spirit, being most impatient with myself that I entered not into Thy will and covenant, O my God, which all my bones cried out unto me to enter, extolling it to the skies. And we enter not therein by ships, or chariots, or feet, no, nor by going so far as I had come from the house to that place where we were sitting. For not to go only, but to enter there, was naught else but to will to go, but to will it resolutely and thoroughly; not to stagger and sway about this way and that, a changeable and half-wounded will, wrestling, with one part falling as another rose.

For those in whom the Holy One dwells, He makes holy, even as the Good One makes men good. And the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are holy and good, as has been shown. \"Acting as a guide to those who approach the mystery.\" This may well be said of Apollos who watered what Paul planted. For the Apostle plants by his guidance[fn-12-P1272_692308:250-nf] , and Apollos, when he baptizes, waters by Sacramental regeneration, bringing to the mystery those who were instructed by Paul. Thus he places on a level with Apollos that Spirit Who perfects men through baptism. \"Distributing every gift.\" With this we too agree; for everything that is good is a portion of the gifts of the Holy Spirit. \"Co-operating with the faithful for the understanding and contemplation of things appointed.\" As he does not add by whom they are appointed, he leaves his meaning doubtful, whether it is correct or the reverse. But we will by a slight addition advance his statement so as to make it consistent with godliness. For since, whether it be the word of wisdom, or the word of knowledge, or faith, or help, or government, or aught else that is enumerated in the lists of saving gifts, \"all these worketh that one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will[fn-12-P1273_693352:251-nf] ,\" we therefore do not reject the statement of Eunomius when he says that the Spirit \"co-operates with the faithful for understanding and contemplation of things appointed\" by Him, because by Him all good teachings are appointed for us. \"Sounding an accompaniment to those who pray.\" It would be foolish seriously to examine the meaning of this expression, of which the ludicrous and meaningless character is at once manifest to all. For who is so demented and beside himself as to wait for us to tell him that the Holy Spirit is not a bell nor an empty cask sounding an accompaniment and made to ring by the voice of him who prays as it were by a blow? \"Leading us to that which is expedient for us.\" This the Father and the Son likewise do: for \"He leadeth Joseph like a sheep[fn-12-P1274_694154:252-nf] ,\" and, \"led His people like sheep[fn-12-P1275_694209:253-nf] ,\" and, \"the good Spirit leadeth us in a land of righteousness[fn-12-P1276_694295:254-nf] .\" \"Strengthening us to godliness.\" To strengthen man to godliness David says is the work of God; \"For Thou art my strength and my refuge[fn-12-P1277_694460:255-nf] ,\" says the Psalmist, and \"the Lord is the strength of His people[fn-12-P1278_694550:256-nf] ,\" and, \"He shall give strength and power unto His people[fn-12-P1279_694630:257-nf] .\" If then the expressions of Eunomius are meant in accordance with the mind of the Psalmist, they are a testimony to the Divinity of the Holy Ghost: but if they are opposed to the word of prophecy, then by this very fact a charge of blasphemy lies against Eunomius, because he sets up his own opinions in opposition to the holy prophets. Next he says, \"Lightening souls with the light of knowledge.\" This grace also the doctrine of godliness ascribes alike to the Father, to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. For He is called a light by David[fn-12-P1280_695195:258-nf] , and from thence the light of knowledge shines in them who are enlightened. In like manner also the cleansing of our thoughts of which the statement speaks is proper to the power of the Lord. For it was \"the brightness of the Father's glory, and the express image of His person,\" Who \"purged our sins[fn-12-P1281_695518:259-nf] .\" Again, to banish devils, which Eunomius says is a property of the Spirit, this also the only-begotten God, Who said to the devil, \"I charge thee[fn-12-P1282_695684:260-nf] ,\" ascribes to the power of the Spirit, when He says, \"If I by the Spirit of God cast out devils[fn-12-P1283_695808:261-nf] ,\" so that the expulsion of devils is not destructive of the glory of the Spirit, but rather a demonstration of His divine and transcendent power. \"Healing the sick,\" he says, \"curing the infirm, comforting the afflicted, raising up those who stumble, recovering the distressed.\" These are the words of those who think reverently of the Holy Ghost, for no one would ascribe the operation of any one of these effects to any one except to God. If then heresy affirms that those things which it belongs to none save God alone to effect, are wrought by the power of the Spirit, we have in support of the truths for which we are contending the witness even of our adversaries. How does the Psalmist seek his healing from God, saying, \"Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak; O Lord, heal me, for my hones are vexed[fn-12-P1284_696647:262-nf] !\" It is to God that Isaiah says, \"The dew that is from Thee is healing unto them[fn-12-P1285_696747:263-nf] .\" Again, prophetic language attests that the conversion of those in error is the work of God. For \"they went astray in the wilderness in a thirsty land,\" says the Psalmist, and he adds, \"So He led them forth by the right way, that they might go to the city where they dwelt[fn-12-P1286_697050:264-nf] :\" and, \"when the Lord turned again the captivity of Sion[fn-12-P1287_697131:265-nf] .\" In like manner also the comfort of the afflicted is ascribed to God, Paul thus speaking, \"Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who comforteth us in all our tribulation[fn-12-P1288_697344:266-nf] .\" Again, the Psalmist says, speaking in the person of God \"Thou calledst upon Me in trouble and I delivered thee[fn-12-P1289_697491:267-nf] .\" And the setting upright of those who stumble is innumerable times ascribed by Scripture to the power of the Lord: \"Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall, but the Lord was my help[fn-12-P1290_697703:268-nf] ,\" and \"Though he fall, he shall not be cast away, for the Lord upholdeth him with His hand[fn-12-P1291_697818:269-nf] ,\" and \"The Lord helpeth them that are fallen[fn-12-P1292_697887:270-nf] .\" And to the loving-kindness of God confessedly belongs the recovery of the distressed, if Eunomius means the same thing of which we learn in prophecy, as the Scripture says, \"Thou laidest trouble upon our loins; Thou sufferedst men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, and Thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place[fn-12-P1293_698246:271-nf] .\"","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":26,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_13_to_pammachius_against_john_of_jerusalem","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"40","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"33.

But the image which is renewed in the spirit of the mind in the knowledge of God, not outwardly, but inwardly, from day to day, shall be perfected by that sight itself; which then after the judgment shall be face to face, but now makes progress as through a glass in an enigma.[fn-18-P1888_942750:77-nf] And we must understand it to be said on account of this perfection, that \"we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.\" For this gift will be given to us at that time, when it shall have been said, \"Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you.\"[fn-18-P1889_943050:78-nf] For then will the ungodly be taken away, so that he shall not see the glory of the Lord,[fn-18-P1890_943159:79-nf] when those on the left hand shall go into eternal punishment, while those on the right go into life eternal.[fn-18-P1891_943288:80-nf] But \"this is eternal life,\" as the Truth tells us; \"to know Thee,\" He says, \"the one true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.\"[fn-18-P1892_943442:81-nf] ","title":"Book XIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":26,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_16_letter_ii_a_letter_of_sulpitius_severus_to_his_sister_claudia_concerning_virginity_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"52","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Take heed that ye love not human glory in any respect, lest your portion also be reckoned among those to whom it was said, \"How[fn-8-P836_333772:57-nf] can ye believe, who seek glory, one from another?\" and of whom it is said through the prophet, \"Increase[fn-8-P837_333912:58-nf] evils to them; increase evils to the boastful of the earth\"; and elsewhere, \"Ye are confounded[fn-8-P838_334041:59-nf] from your boasting, from your reproaching in the sight of the Lord.\" For I do not wish you to have regard to those, who are virgins of the world, and not of Christ; who unmindful of their purpose and profession, rejoice in delicacies, are delighted with riches, and boast of their descent from a merely carnal nobility; who, if they assuredly believed themselves to be the daughters of God, would never, after their divine ancestry, admire mere human nobility, nor glory in any honored earthly father: if they felt that they had God as their Father, they would not love any nobility connected with the flesh. Why, thou foolish woman, dost thou flatter thyself about the nobleness of thy descent, and take delight in it?

Thus mere earthly rank is overshadowed by the brilliance of heavenly glory, and henceforth is taken no account of, while those who formerly had been unequal in worldly honors are now equallystrayed in the glory of a heavenly and divine nobility. There is now among such no place for lowness of birth; nor is any one inferior to another whom the majesty of the divine birth adorns; except in the estimation of those who do not think that the things of heaven are to be preferred to those of earth. There can be no worldly boasting among them, if they reflect how vain a thing it is that they should, in smaller matters, prefer themselves to those whom they know to be equal to themselves in greater matters, and should regard, as placed below themselves on earth, those whom they believe to be equal to themselves in what relates to heaven.

In this place \"fire out of heaven\" is well understood of the firmness of the saints, wherewith they refuse to yield obedience to those who rage against them. For the firmament is \"heaven,\" by whose firmness these assailants shall be pained with blazing zeal, for they shall be impotent to draw away the saints to the party of Antichrist.

And if we would more exactly and carefully scrutinize the words which refer to the resurrection of the good, we may refer to the first resurrection the words, \"the dead shall rise again,\" and to the second the following words, \"and all who were in the graves shall rise again.\" And if we ask what relates to those saints whom the Lord at His coming shall find alive upon earth, the following clause may suitably be referred to them; \"All who are in the earth shall rejoice: for the dew which is from Thee is their health.\" By \"health\" in this place it is best to understand immortality. For that is the most perfect health which is not repaired by nourishment as by a daily remedy. In like manner the same prophet, affording hope to the good and terrifying the wicked regarding the day of judgment, says, \"Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will flow down upon them as a river of peace, and upon the glory of the Gentiles as a rushing torrent; their sons shall be carried on the shoulders, and shall be comforted on the knees. As one whom his mother comforteth, so shall I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem. And ye shall see, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall rise up like a herb; and the hand of the Lord shall be known by His worshippers, and He shall threaten the contumacious. For, behold, the Lord shall come as a fire, and as a whirlwind His chariots, to execute vengeance with indignation, and wasting with a flame of fire. For with fire of the Lord shall all the earth be judged, and all flesh with His sword: many shall be wounded by the Lord.\"[fn-39-P3953_2174216:102-nf] In His promise to the good he says that He will flow down as a river of peace, that is to say, in the greatest possible abundance of peace. With this peace we shall in the end be refreshed; but of this we have spoken abundantly in the preceding book. It is this river in which he says He shall flow down upon those to whom He promises so great happiness, that we may understand that in the region of that felicity, which is in heaven, all things are satisfied from this river. But because there shall thence flow, even upon earthly bodies, the peace of incorruption and immortality, therefore he says that He shall flow down as this river, that He may as it were pour Himself from things above to things beneath, and make men the equals of the angels. By \"Jerusalem,\" too, we should understand not that which serves with her children, but that which, according to the apostle, is our free mother, eternal in the heavens.[fn-39-P3954_2175163:103-nf] In her we shall be comforted as we pass toilworn from earth's cards and calamities, and be taken up as her children on her knees and shoulders.

Let no one disturb the clearness of the meaning by any cloudy contradiction; but let what follows furnish its testimony to the words that precede. For after saying, \"I will that they also be with me where I am,\" He went on immediately to add, \"That they may behold my glory, which Thou gavest me: for Thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.\" \"That they may behold,\" He said; not, that they may believe. This is faith's wages,[fn-35-P3583_1987865:16-nf] not faith itself. For if faith has been correctly defined in the Epistle to the Hebrews as \"the assurance [conviction] of things that are not seen,\"[fn-35-P3584_1988027:17-nf] why may not the wages of faith be defined, the beholding of things which were hoped for in faith? For when we shall see the glory which the Father hath given the Son, even though we may understand what is spoken of in this passage, not as that [glory] which the Father gave His co-equal Son in begetting Him, but as that which He gave Him, when become the Son of man, after the death of the cross;-when, I say, we shall see that glory of the Son, then of a certainty shall take place the judgment of the quick and the dead, and then shall the wicked be taken away that he may not behold the glory of the Lord;[fn-35-P3585_1988654:18-nf] and what [glory], save that of His Godhead? For blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God:[fn-35-P3586_1988777:19-nf] and because the wicked are not pure in heart, therefore they shall not see Then shall they go away into everlasting punishment; for so shall the wicked be taken away, that he may not behold the glory of the Lord: but the righteous shall go into life eternal.[fn-35-P3587_1989053:20-nf] And what is life eternal? \"That they may know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent\" (ver. 3): not, indeed, as those knew Him, who although impure in heart, yet were able to see Him as He sat in judgment in His glorified servant-form; but as He is yet to be known by the pure in heart, as the only true God, the Son along with the Father and Holy Spirit, because the Trinity itself is the only true God. If, then, it is in reference to His Godhead as the Son of God, equal and co-eternal with the Father, that we take the words, \"I will that they also be with me where I am,\" we shall be with Christ in the Father; but He in His own way, we in ours, wherever we may be in body. For if localities are to be understood, and such as contain incorporeal beings, and everything has a place where it is, the eternal place of Christ where He always is, is the Father Himself, and the place of the Father is the Son; for \"I,\" He said, \"am in the Father, and the Father in me;\"[fn-35-P3588_1990067:21-nf] and in this prayer, \"As Thou, Father, art in me, and I in Thee:\" and they are our place, because there follows, \"That they also may be one in us:\" and we are God's place, inasmuch as we are His temple; even as He, who died for us and liveth for us, also prayeth for us, that we may be one in them; because \"His [dwelling] place was made in peace,[fn-35-P3589_1990434:22-nf] and His habitation in Zion,\"[fn-35-P3590_1990559:23-nf] which we are. But who is qualified to think on such places or what is in them, apart from the idea of space-defined capacities and material masses? Yet no little progress is made, if at least, when any such idea presents itself to the eye of the mind, it is denied, rejected, and reprobated: and a certain kind of light is, as far as possible, thought of, in which such things are perceived as deserving only to be denied, rejected, and reprobated; and the certainty of that light is known and loved, so that from thence an upward movement is begun in us, and an effort made to reach into places farther within: and when the mind through its own infirmity and still inferior purity has failed to penetrate them it is driven back again, not without the sighings of love and the tears of ardent longing, and continues to bear in patience until it is purified by faith, and prepared by the holiness of the inward life to be able to take up its abode therein.","title":"Tractate CXI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":26,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"140","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"86. Consequently, let us now take up the subject which we had postponed, and inquire what mystical meaning may underlie the report given by Matthew and Mark, namely, that on rising He made this statement, \"I will go before you into Galilee: there shall ye see me.\" For this announcement, if it was fulfilled at all, was certainly not fulfilled till a considerable interval had elapsed; whereas it is couched in terms which seem to lead us (although such a conclusion is not an absolute necessity) most naturally to expect that the appearance referred to would be either the only one or the first that would ensue. We observe, however, that the words in question are not given as the words of the evangelist himself, in the form of a narrative of a past occurrence, but as the words of the angel, who spoke according to the Lord's commission, and subsequently also as the words of the Lord Himself; that is to say, the words are used by the evangelist in his narrative, but they are presented by him as a direct statement of what was spoken by the angel and by the Lord. This, therefore, unquestionably compels us to accept them as uttered prophetically.[fn-27-P2724_1210862:350-nf] Now Galilee may be interpreted to mean either \"Transmigration\" or \"Revelation.\" Consequently, if we adopt the idea of \"Transmigration,\" what other sense occurs to us to put upon the sentence,\" He goeth before you into Galilee, there shall you see Him,\" but just this, that the grace of Christ was to be transferred from the people of Israel to the Gentiles? That in preaching the gospel to these Gentiles, the apostles would meet with no acceptance unless the Lord prepared a way for them in the hearts of men,-this may be what is to be understood by the sentence, \"He goeth before you into Galilee.\" And, again, that they would look with joy and wonder at the breaking down and removing of difficulties, and at the opening of a door for them in the Lord through the enlightenment of the believing,-this is what is to be understood by the words, \"there shall ye see Him;\" that is to say, there shall ye find His members, there shall ye recognise His living body in the person of those who shall receive you. Or, if we follow the second view which takes Galilee to signify \"Revelation,\" the idea may be, that He was now no more to be in the form of a servant, but in that form in which He is equal with the Father;[fn-27-P2725_1212260:351-nf] as He promised to those who loved Him when He said, according to the testimony of John, \"And I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.\"[fn-27-P2726_1212427:352-nf] That is to say, He was afterwards to manifest Himself, not merely as they saw Him before, nor merely in the way in which, rising as He did with His wounds upon Him, He was to give Himself to be touched as well as seen by them, but in the character of that ineffable light, wherewith He enlightens every man that cometh into this world, and in virtue of which He shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehends Him not.[fn-27-P2727_1212869:353-nf] Thus has He gone before us to something from which He withdraws not, although He comes to us, and which does not involve His leaving us, although He has preceded us thither. That will be a revelation which may be spoken of as a true Galilee, when we shall be like Him; there shall we see Him as He is.[fn-27-P2728_1213191:354-nf] Then, also, will there be for us the more blessed transmigration, from this world into that eternity, if we embrace His precepts so as to be counted worthy of being set apart on His right hand. For there, those on the left hand shall go away into eternal burning, but the righteous into life eternal.[fn-27-P2729_1213514:355-nf] Hence they shall pass thither, and there, shall they see Him, as the wicked do not see Him. For the wicked shall be taken away, so that he shall not see the brightness of the Lord;[fn-27-P2730_1213720:356-nf] and the unrighteousness shall not see the light. For He says, \"And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent;\"[fn-27-P2731_1213917:357-nf] even as He shall be known in that eternity to which He will bring His servants by the form of a servant, in order that in liberty they may contemplate the form of the Lord.

It is good for thee, O virgin soul, that thus, as thou art a virgin, thus altogether keeping in thy heart that thou hast been born again, keeping in thy flesh that thou hast been born, thou yet conceive of the fear of the Lord, and give birth to the spirit of salvation.[fn-40-P4029_1911425:118-nf] \"Fear,\" indeed, \"there is not in charity, but perfect charity,\" as it is written, \"casteth out fear:\"[fn-40-P4030_1911558:119-nf] but fear of men, not of God: fear of temporal evils, not of the Divine Judgment at the last. \"Be not thou high-minded, but fear.\"[fn-40-P4031_1911723:120-nf] , Love thou the goodness of God; fear thou His severity: neither suffers thee to beproud. For by loving you fear, lest you grievously offend One Who is loved and loves. For what more grievous offense, than that by pride thou displease Him, Who for thy sake hath been displeasing to the proud? And where ought there to be more that \"chaste fear abiding for ever and ever,[fn-40-P4032_1912113:121-nf] than in thee, who hast no thought of the things of this world, how to please a wedded partner; but of the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord?[fn-40-P4033_1912282:122-nf] That other fear is not in charity, but this chaste fear quitteth not charity. If you love not, fear lest you perish; if you love, fear lest you displease. That fear charity casteth out, with this it runneth within. The Apostle Paul also says, \"For we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but we have received the spirit of adoption of sons, wherein we cry, Abba, Father.\"[fn-40-P4034_1912695:123-nf] I believe that he speaks of that fear, which had been given in the Old Testament, test the temporal goods should be lost, which God had promised unto those not yet sons under grace, but as yet slaves under the law. There is also the fear of eternal fire, to serve God in order to avoid which is assuredly not yet of perfect charity. For the desire of the reward is one thing, the fear of punishment another. They are different sayings, \"Whither shall I go away from Thy Spirit, and from Thy face whither shall I flee?\"[fn-40-P4035_1913235:124-nf] and, \"One thing I have sought of the Lord, this I will seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord through all the days of my life, that I may consider the delight of the Lord, that I be protected in His temple:\"[fn-40-P4036_1913480:125-nf] and, \"Turn not away Thy face from me:\"[fn-40-P4037_1913540:126-nf] and, \"My soul longeth and fainteth unto the courts of the Lord.[fn-40-P4038_1913625:127-nf] Those sayings let him have had, who dared not to lift up his eyes to heaven; and she who was watering with tears His feet, in order to obtain pardon for her grievous sins; but these do thou have, who art careful about the things of the Lord, to be holy both in body and spirit. With those sayings there companies fear which hath torment, which perfect charity casteth forth; but with these sayings there companies chaste fear of the Lord, that abideth for ever and ever. And to both kinds it must be said, \"Be not thou high-minded, but fear;\"[fn-40-P4039_1914191:128-nf] that man neither of defense of his sins, nor of presumption of righteousness set himself up. For Paul also himself, who saith, \"For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;\"[fn-40-P4040_1914403:129-nf] yet, fear being a companion of charity, saith, \"With fear and much trembling was I towards you:\"[fn-40-P4041_1914522:130-nf] and that saying, which I have mentioned, that the engrafted wild olive tree be not proud against the broken branches of the olive tree, himself made use of, saying, \"Be not thou high-minded, but fear;\" himself admonishing all the members of Christ in general, saith, \"With fear and trembling work out your own salvation; for it is God Who worketh in you both to will and to do, according to His good pleasure;\"[fn-40-P4042_1914954:131-nf] that it seem not to pertain unto the Old Testament what is written, \"Serve the Lord in fear, and rejoice unto Him with trembling.\"[fn-40-P4043_1915122:132-nf] ","title":"Of Holy Virginity.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":26,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_31_on_virginity","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"68","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But besides other things the action of Miriam the prophetess also gives rise to these surmisings of ours.

Since, however, no injury had as yet alighted on the people from their dispersion, although the hope of the resurrection had very frequently failed amongst them, it is manifest that it was owing to the perishing condition of their bodies that their faith in the resurrection was shaken. God, therefore was rebuilding the faith which the people were pulling down. But even if it were true that Israel was then depressed at some shock in their existing circumstances, we must not on that account suppose that the purpose of revelation could have rested in a parable: its aim must have been to testify a resurrection, in order to raise the nation's hope to even an eternal salvation and an indispensable restoration, and thereby turn off their minds from brooding over their present affairs. This indeed is the aim of other prophets likewise. \"Ye shall go forth,\" (says Malachi), \"from your sepulchres, as young calves let loose from their bonds, and ye shall tread down your enemies.\"[fn-99-P9979_2764298:207-nf] And again, (Isaiah says): \"Your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall spring up like the grass,\"[fn-99-P9980_2764421:208-nf] because the grass also is renewed by the dissolution and corruption of the seed. In a word, if it is contended that the figure of the rising bones refers properly to the state of Israel, why is the same hope announced to all nations, instead of being limited to Israel only, of reinvesting those osseous remains with bodily substance and vital breath, and of raising up their dead out of the grave? For the language is universal: \"The dead shall arise, and come forth from their graves; for the dew which cometh from Thee is medicine to their bones.\"[fn-99-P9981_2764994:209-nf] In another passage it is written: \"All flesh shall come to worship before me, saith the Lord.\"[fn-99-P9982_2765111:210-nf] When?

For when divine judgment is reasoning with men it must speak with the language and feelings of men. For when a doctor for the sake of health with good reason either cuts or cauterizes those who are suffering from the inflammation of ulcers, it is considered an evil by those who have to bear it. Nor are the spur and the whip pleasant to a restive horse. Moreover all chastisement seems at the moment to be a bitter thing to those who are chastised, as the Apostle says: \"Now all chastisement for the present indeed seemeth not to bring with it joy but sorrow; but afterwards it will yield to them that are exercised by it most peaceable fruits of righteousness,\" and \"whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth: for what son is there whom the father doth not correct?\"[fn-42-P4290_1581725:20-nf] And so evils are sometimes wont to stand for afflictions, as where we read: \"And God repented of the evil which He had said that He would do to them and He did it not.\"[fn-42-P4291_1581915:21-nf] And again: \"For Thou, Lord, are gracious and merciful, patient and very merciful and ready to repent of the evil,\"[fn-42-P4292_1582057:22-nf] i.e., of the sufferings and losses which Thou art forced to bring upon us as the reward of our sins. And another prophet, knowing that these are profitable to some men, and certainly not through any jealousy of their safety, but with an eye to their good, prays thus: \"Add evils to them, O Lord, add evils to the haughty ones of the earth;\"[fn-42-P4293_1582423:23-nf] and the Lord Himself says \"Lo, I will bring evils upon them,\"[fn-42-P4294_1582511:24-nf] i.e., sorrows, and losses, with which they shall for the present be chastened for their soul's health, and so shall be at length driven to return and hasten back to Me whom in their prosperity they scorned. And so that these are originally evil we cannot possibly assert: for to many they conduce to their good and offer the occasions of eternal bliss, and therefore (to return to the question raised) all those things, which are thought to be brought upon us as evils by our enemies or by any other people, should not be counted as evils, but as things indifferent. For in the end they will not be what he thinks, who brought them upon us in his rage and fury, but what he makes them who endures them. And so when death has been brought upon a saint, we ought not to think that an evil has happened to him but a thing indifferent; which is an evil to a wicked man, while to the good it is rest and freedom from evils. \"For death is rest to a man whose way is hidden.\"[fn-42-P4295_1583498:25-nf] And so a good man does not suffer any loss from it, because he suffers nothing strange, but by the crime of an enemy he only receives (and not without the reward of eternal life) that which would have happened to him in the course of nature, and pays the debt of man's death, which must be paid by an inevitable law, with the interest of a most fruitful passion, and the recompense of a great reward.","title":"VI.

If they had not avoided their persecutors, how would it have come to pass that the Lord should spring from the seed of David? Or who would have preached the glad tidings of the word of truth? It was for this that the persecutors sought after the saints, that there might be no one to teach, as the Jews charged the Apostles; but for this cause they endured all things, that the Gospel might be preached. Behold, therefore, in that they were thus engaged in conflict with their enemies, they passed not the time of their flight unprofitably, nor while they were persecuted, did they forget the welfare of others: but as being ministers of the good word, they grudged not to communicate it to all men; so that even while they fled, they preached the Gospel, and gave warning of the wickedness of those who conspired against them, and confirmed the faithful by their exhortations. Thus the blessed Paul, having found it so by experience, declared beforehand, `As many as will live godly in Christ, shall suffer persecution[fn-44-P4495_1844875:100-nf] .' And so he straightway prepared them that fled for the trial, saying, `Let us run with patience the race that is set before us[fn-44-P4496_1845027:101-nf] ;' for although there be continual tribulations, `yet tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope, and hope maketh not ashamed[fn-44-P4497_1845205:102-nf] .'

For the Son of God indeed, being Himself the Word, is Lord of all; but we once were subject from the first to the slavery of corruption and the curse of the Law, then by degrees fashioning for ourselves things that were not, we served, as says the blessed Apostle, `them which by nature are no Gods[fn-58-P5894_2352927:76-nf] ,' and, ignorant of the true God, we preferred things that were not to the truth; but afterwards, as the ancient people when oppressed in Egypt groaned, so, when we too had the Law `engrafted[fn-58-P5895_2353136:77-nf] ' in us, and according to the unutterable sighings[fn-58-P5896_2353205:78-nf] of the Spirit made our intercession, `O Lord our God, take possession of us[fn-58-P5897_2353301:79-nf] ,' then, as `He became for a house of refuge' and a `God and defence,' so also He became our Lord. Nor did He then begin to be, but we began to have Him for our Lord. For upon this, God being good and Father of the Lord, in pity, and desiring to be known by all, makes His own Son put on Him a human body and become man, and be called Jesus, that in this body offering Himself for all, He might deliver all from false worship and corruption, and might Himself become of all Lord and King. His becoming therefore in this way Lord and King, this it is that Peter means by, `He hath made Him Lord,' and `hath sent Christ;' as much as to say, that the Father in making Him man (for to be made belongs to man), did not simply make Him man, but has made Him in order to His being Lord of all men, and to His hallowing all through the Anointing. For though the Word existing in the form of God took a servant's form, yet the assumption of the flesh did not make a servant[fn-58-P5898_2354290:80-nf] of the Word, who was by nature Lord; but rather, not only was it that emancipation of all humanity which takes place by the Word, but that very Word who was by nature Lord, and was then made man, hath by means of a servant's form been made Lord of all and Christ, that is, in order to hallow all by the Spirit. And as God, when `becoming a God and defence,' and saying, `I will be a God to them,' does not then become God more than before, nor then begins to become God, but, what He ever is, that He then becomes to those who need Him, when it pleaseth Him, so Christ also being by nature Lord and King everlasting, does not become Lord more than He was at the time He is sent forth, nor then begins to be Lord and King, but what He is ever, that He then is made according to the flesh; and, having redeemed all, He becomes thereby again Lord of quick and dead. For Him henceforth do all things serve, and this is David's meaning in the Psalm, `The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on My right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool[fn-58-P5899_2355618:81-nf] .'

Now we say that the wicked are dead, but not in an ascetic life opposed to sin; nor do they, like the saints, bear about dying in their bodies. But it is the soul which they bury in sins and follies, drawing near to the dead, and satisfying it with dead nourishment; like young eagles which, from high places, fly upon the carcases of the dead, and which the law prohibited, commanding figuratively, `Thou shalt not eat the eagle, nor any other bird that feedeth on a dead carcass[fn-91-P9142_3328955:12-nf] ;' and it pronounced unclean whatsoever eateth the dead.
