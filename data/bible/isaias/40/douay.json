And I said:  What shall I cry?\nAll flesh is grass, and all the glory thereof as the flower of the field.","The grass is withered, and the flower is fallen, because the\nspirit of the Lord hath blown upon it.  Indeed the people is grass:","The grass is withered, and the flower is fallen:  but the word of\nour Lord endureth for ever.","Get thee up upon a high mountain, thou that bringest good tidings\nto Sion:  lift up thy voice with strength, thou that bringest good\ntidings to Jerusalem:  lift it up, fear not.
