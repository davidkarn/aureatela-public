He was justified not only by works, but also by faith[fn-6-P674_156140:19-nf] : for though he did many things well, yet he was never called the friend of God[fn-6-P675_156484:20-nf] , except when he believed. Moreover, his every work was performed in faith. Through faith he left his parents; left country, and place, and home through faith[fn-6-P676_156702:21-nf] . In like manner, therefore, as he was justified be thou justified also. In his body he was already dead in regard to offspring, and Sarah his wife was now old, and there was no hope left of having children. God promises the old man a child, and Abraham without being weakened in faith, though he considered his own body now as good as dead[fn-6-P677_157063:22-nf] , heeded not the weakness of his body, but the power of Him who promised, because he counted Him faithful who had promised[fn-6-P678_157204:23-nf] , and so beyond all expectation gained the child from bodies as it were already dead. And when, after he had gained his son, he was commanded to offer him up, although he had heard the word, In Isaac shall thy seed be called[fn-6-P679_157451:24-nf] , he proceeded to offer up his son, his only son, to God, believing that God is able to raise up even from the dead[fn-6-P680_157585:25-nf] . And having bound his son, and laid him on the wood, he did in purpose offer him, but by the goodness of God in delivering to him a lamb instead of his child, he received his son alive. Being faithful in these things, he was sealed for righteousness, and received circumcision as a seal of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision[fn-6-P681_157948:26-nf] , having received a promise that he should be the father of many nations[fn-6-P682_158040:27-nf] .","title":"Lecture V.","author":"Cyril"},{"chapter":41,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_19_an_answer_to_the_jews_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"ANF-03","text":"For why should God, the founder of the universe, the Governor of the whole world,[fn-20-P2045_697669:14-nf] the Fashioner of humanity, the Sower[fn-20-P2046_697718:15-nf] of universal nations be believed to have given a law through Moses to one people, and not be said to have assigned it to all nations? For unless He had given it to all by no means would He have habitually permitted even proselytes out of the nations to have access to it. But-as is congruous with the goodness of God, and with His equity, as the Fashioner of mankind-He gave to all nations the selfsame law, which at definite and stated times He enjoined should be observed, when He willed, and through whom He willed, and as He willed. For in the beginning of the world He gave to Adam himself and Eve a law, that they were not to eat of the fruit of the tree planted in the midst of paradise; but that, if they did contrariwise, by death they were to die.[fn-20-P2047_698574:16-nf] Which law had continued enough for them, had it been kept. For in this law given to Adam we recognise in embryo[fn-20-P2048_698720:17-nf] all the precepts which afterwards sprouted forth when given through Moses; that is, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God from thy whole heart and out of thy whole soul; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;[fn-20-P2049_698941:18-nf] Thou shalt not kill; Thou shall not commit adultery; Thou shalt not steal; False witness thou shall not utter; Honour thy father and mother; and, That which is another's, shall thou not covet. For the primordial law was given to Adam and Eve in paradise, as the womb of all the precepts of God. In short, if they had loved the Lord their God, they would not have contravened His precept; if they had habitually loved their neighbour-that is, themselves[fn-20-P2050_699548:19-nf] -they would not have believed the persuasion of the serpent, and thus would not have committed murder upon themselves,[fn-20-P2051_699698:20-nf] by falling[fn-20-P2052_699740:21-nf] from immortality, by contravening God's precept; from theft also they would have abstained, if they had not stealthily tasted of the fruit of the tree, nor had been anxious to skulk beneath a tree to escape the view of the Lord their God; nor would they have been made partners with the falsehood-asseverating devil, by believing him that they would be \"like God; \"and thus they would not have offended God either, as their Father, who had fashioned them from clay of the earth, as out of the womb of a mother; if they had not coveted another's, they would not have tasted of the unlawful fruit. Therefore, in this general and primordial law of God, the observance of which, in the case of the tree's fruit, He had sanctioned, we recognise enclosed all the precepts specially of the posterior Law, which germinated when disclosed at their proper times. For the subsequent superinduction of a law is the work of the same Being who had before premised a precept; since it is His province withal subsequently to train, who had before resolved to form, righteous creatures. For what wonder if He extends a discipline who institutes it? if He advances who begins? In short, before the Law of Moses,[fn-20-P2053_701005:22-nf] written in stone-tables, I contend that there was a law unwritten, which was habitually understood naturally, and by the fathers was habitually kept. For whence was Noah \"found righteous,\"[fn-20-P2054_701248:23-nf] if in his case the righteousness of a natural law had not preceded? Whence was Abraham accounted \"a friend of God,\"[fn-20-P2055_701408:24-nf] if not on the ground of equity and righteousness, (in the observance) of a natural law? Whence was Melchizedek named \"priest of the most high God,\"[fn-20-P2056_701591:25-nf] if, before the priesthood of the Levitical law, there were not levites who were wont to offer sacrifices to God? For thus, after the above-mentioned patriarchs, was the Law given to Moses, at that (well-known) time after their exode from Egypt, after the interval and spaces of four hundred years. In fact, it was after Abraham's \"four hundred and thirty years\"[fn-20-P2057_702033:26-nf] that the Law was given. Whence we understand that God's law was anterior even to Moses, and was not first (given) in Horeb, nor in Sinai and in the desert, but was more ancient; (existing) first in paradise, subsequently reformed for the patriarchs, and so again for the Jews, at definite periods: so that we are not to give heed to Moses' Law as to the primitive law, but as to a subsequent, which at a definite period God has set forth to the Gentiles too and, after repeatedly promising so to do through the prophets, has reformed for the better; and has premonished that it should come to pass that, just as \"the law was given through Moses\"[fn-20-P2058_702739:27-nf] at a definite time, so it should be believed to have been temporarily observed and kept. And let us not annul this power which God has, which reforms the law's precepts answerably to the circumstances of the times, with a view to man's salvation. In fine, let him who contends that the Sabbath is still to be observed as a balm of salvation, and circumcision on the eighth day because of the threat of death, teach us that, for the time past, righteous men kept the Sabbath, or practised circumcision, and were thus rendered \"friends of God.\" For if circumcision purges a man since God made Adam uncircumcised, why did He not circumcise him, even after his sinning, if circumcision purges? At all events, in settling him in paradise, He appointed one uncircumcised as colonist of paradise. Therefore, since God originated Adam uncircumcised, and inobservant of the Sabbath, consequently his offspring also, Abel, offering Him sacrifices, uncircumcised and inobservant of the Sabbath, was by Him commended; while He accepted[fn-20-P2059_703780:28-nf] what he was offering in simplicity of heart, and reprobated the sacrifice of his brother Cain, who was not rightly dividing what he was offering.[fn-20-P2060_703955:29-nf] Noah also, uncircumcised-yes, and inobservant of the Sabbath-God freed from the deluge.[fn-20-P2061_704104:30-nf] For Enoch, too, most righteous man, uncircumcised and in-observant of the Sabbath, He translated from this world;[fn-20-P2062_704259:31-nf] who did not first taste[fn-20-P2063_704320:32-nf] death, in order that, being a candidate for eternal life,[fn-20-P2064_704418:33-nf] he might by this time show us that we also may, without the burden of the law of Moses, please God.

But inasmuch as I shall now from this point have to grapple with my opponent on a distinct issue and in close combat, I perceive that I must advance even here some lines, at which the battle will have to be delivered; they are the Scriptures of the Creator. For as I shall have to prove that Christ was from the Creator, according to these (Scriptures), which were afterwards accomplished in the Creator's Christ, I find it necessary to set forth the form and, so to speak, the nature of the Scriptures themselves, that they may not distract the reader's attention by being called into controversy at the moment of their application to subjects of discussion, and by their proof being confounded with the proof of the subjects themselves. Now there are two conditions of prophetic announcement which I adduce, as requiring the assent of our adversaries in the future stages of the discussion. One, that future events are sometimes announced as if they were already passed. For it is[fn-48-P4833_1531351:53-nf] consistent with Deity to regard as accomplished facts whatever It has determined on, because there is no difference of time with that Being in whom eternity itself directs a uniform condition of seasons. It is indeed more natural[fn-48-P4834_1531630:54-nf] to the prophetic divination to represent as seen and already brought to pass,[fn-48-P4835_1531724:55-nf] even while forseeing it, that which it foresees; in other words, that which is by all means future. As for instance, in Isaiah: \"I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks (I exposed) to their hands. I hid not my face from shame and spitting.\"[fn-48-P4836_1531986:56-nf] For whether it was Christ even then, as we hold, or the prophet, as the Jews say, who pronounced these words concerning himself, in either case, that which as yet had not happened sounded as if it had been already accomplished. Another characteristic will be, that very many events are figuratively predicted by means of enigmas and allegories and parables, and that they must be understood in a sense different from the literal description. For we both read Of \"the mountains dropping down new wine,\"[fn-48-P4837_1532521:57-nf] but not as if one might expect \"must\" from the stones, or its decoction from the rocks; and also hear of \"a land flowing with milk and honey,\"[fn-48-P4838_1532683:58-nf] but not as if you were to suppose that you would ever gather Samian cakes from the ground; nor does God, forsooth, offer His services as a water-bailiff or a farmer when He says, \"I will open rivers in a land; I will plant in the wilderness the cedar and the box-tree.\"[fn-48-P4839_1532993:59-nf] In like manner, when, foretelling the conversion of the Gentiles, He says, \"The beasts of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls,\" He surely never meant to derive[fn-48-P4840_1533210:60-nf] His fortunate omens from the young of birds and foxes, and from the songsters of marvel and fable. But why enlarge on such a subject? When the very apostle whom our heretics adopt,[fn-48-P4841_1533406:61-nf] interprets the law which allows an unmuzzled mouth to the oxen that tread out the corn, not of cattle, but of ourselves;[fn-48-P4842_1533885:62-nf] and also alleges that the rock which followed (the Israelites) and supplied them with drink was Christ;[fn-48-P4843_1534008:63-nf] teaching the Galatians, moreover, that the two narratives of the sons of Abraham had an allegorical meaning in their course;[fn-48-P4844_1534186:64-nf] and to the Ephesians giving an intimation that, when it was declared in the beginning that a man should leave his father and mother and become one flesh with his wife, he applied this to Christ and the church.[fn-48-P4845_1534418:65-nf] ","title":"Book III.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":41,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_26_book_iv_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"139","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"108.

God shall also attest the same; but He has also sworn sometimes by Himself, that there is no other God like Him.[fn-82-P8243_2335065:60-nf] Hermogenes, however, will make Him a liar. For Matter will be such a God as He-being unmade, unborn, without beginning, and without end. God will say, \"I am the first!\"[fn-82-P8244_2335253:61-nf] Yet how is He the first, when Matter is co-eternal with Him?

It also was first with God, as God, too, was first with it; it, however, is not comparable with God, as God, too, is not to be compared with it; with God also it was the Author (of all things), and with God their Sovereign. In this way he proposes that God has something, and yet not the whole, of Matter. For Him, accordingly, Hermogenes has reserved nothing which he had not equally conferred on Matter, so that it is not Matter which is compared with God, but rather God who is compared with Matter. Now, inasmuch as those qualities which we claim as peculiar to God-to have always existed, without a beginning, without an end, and to have been the First, and Alone, and the Author of all things-are also compatible to Matter, I want to know what property Matter possesses different and alien from God, and hereby special to itself, by reason of which it is incapable of being compared with God?

But (if we are to follow the heretics), the Gospel itself will have to be rejected, because it tells us that all things were made by God through the Word, without whom nothing was made.[fn-106-P10662_2996040:228-nf] And if I am not mistaken, there is also another passage in which it is written: \"By the Word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the hosts of them by His Spirit.\"[fn-106-P10663_2996228:229-nf] Now this Word, the Power of God and the Wisdom of God, must be the very Son of God. So that, if (He did) all things by the Son, He must have stretched out the heavens by the Son, and so not have stretched them out alone, except in the sense in which He is \"alone\" (and apart) from all other gods. Accordingly He says, concerning the Son, immediately afterwards: \"Who else is it that frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad, turning wise men backward, and making their knowledge foolish, and confirming the words[fn-106-P10664_2996783:230-nf] of His Son? \"[fn-106-P10665_2996819:231-nf] -as, for instance, when He said, \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye Him.\"[fn-106-P10666_2996986:232-nf] By thus attaching the Son to Himself, He becomes His own interpreter in what sense He stretched out the heavens alone, meaning alone with His Son, even as He is one with His Son. The utterance, therefore, will be in like manner the Son's, \"I have stretched out the heavens alone,\"[fn-106-P10667_2997289:233-nf] because by the Word were the heavens established.[fn-106-P10668_2997361:234-nf] Inasmuch, then, as the heaven was prepared when Wisdom was present in the Word, and since all things were made by the Word, it is quite correct to say that even the Son stretched out the heaven alone, because He alone ministered to the Father's work. It must also be He who says, \"I am the First, and to all futurity I AM.\"[fn-106-P10669_2997707:235-nf] The Word, no doubt, was before all things. \"In the beginning was the Word; \"[fn-106-P10670_2997811:236-nf] and in that beginning He was sent forth[fn-106-P10671_2997869:237-nf] by the Father. The Father, however, has no beginning, as proceeding from none; nor can He be seen, since He was not begotten. He who has always been alone could never have had order or rank. Therefore, if they have determined that the Father and the Son must be regarded as one and the same, for the express purpose of vindicating the unity of God, that unity of His is preserved intact; for He is one, and yet He has a Son, who is equally with Himself comprehended in the same Scriptures. Since they are unwilling to allow that the Son is a distinct Person, second from the Father, lest, being thus second, He should cause two Gods to be spoken of, we have shown above[fn-106-P10672_2998556:238-nf] that Two are actually described in Scripture as God and Lord. And to prevent their being offended at this fact, we give a reason why they are not said to be two Gods and two Lords, but that they are two as Father and Son; and this not by severance of their substance, but from the dispensation wherein we declare the Son to be undivided and inseparable from the Father,-distinct in degree, not in state. And although, when named apart, He is called God, He does not thereby constitute two Gods, but one; and that from the very circumstance that He is entitled to be called God, from His union with the Father.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":41,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_46_a_plea_for_the_christians","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"70","folder":"ANF-02","text":"If we satisfied ourselves with advancing such considerations as these, our doctrines might by some be looked upon as human.

But let it be sufficient for us in all these matters to adapt our understanding to the rule of religion, and so to think of the words of the Holy Spirit as not to deem the language the ornate composition of feeble human eloquence, but to hold, according to the scriptural statement, that\" all the glory of the King is within,\"[fn-73-P7341_1676231:11-nf] and that the treasure of divine meaning is enclosed within the flail vessel of the common letter. And if any curious reader were still to ask an explanation of individual points, let him come and hear, along with ourselves, how the Apostle Paul, seeking to penetrate by help of the Holy Spirit, who searches even the \"deep things\" of God, into the depths of divine wisdom and knowledge, and yet, unable to reach the end, so to speak, and to come to a thorough knowledge, exclaims in despair and amazement, \"Oh the depth of the riches of the knowledge and wisdom of God!\"[fn-73-P7342_1677007:12-nf] Now, that it was from despair of attaining a perfect understanding that he uttered this exclamation, listen to his own words: \"How unsearchable are God's judgments! and His ways, how past finding out! \"[fn-73-P7343_1677228:13-nf] For he did not say that God's judgments were difficult to discover, but that they were altogether inscrutable; nor that it was (simply) difficult to trace out His ways, but that they were altogether past finding out. For however far a man may advance in his investigations, and how great soever the progress that he may make by unremitting study, assisted even by the grace of God, and with his mind enlightened, he will not be able to attain to the end of those things which are the object of his inquiries. Nor can any created mind deem it possible in any way to attain a full comprehension (of things); but after having discovered certain of the objects of its research, it sees again others which have still to be sought out. And even if it should succeed in mastering these, it will see again many others succeeding them which must form the subject of investigation. And on this account, therefore, Solomon, the wisest of men, beholding by his wisdom the nature of things, says, \"I said, I will become wise; and wisdom herself was made far from me, far further than it was; and a profound depth, who shall find? \"[fn-73-P7344_1678365:14-nf] Isaiah also, knowing that the beginnings of things could not be discovered by a mortal nature, and not even by those natures which, although more divine than human, were nevertheless themselves created or formed; knowing then, that by none of these could either the beginning or the end be discovered, says, \"Tell the former things which have been, and we know that ye are gods; or announce what are the last things, and then we shall see that ye are gods.\"[fn-73-P7345_1679015:15-nf] For my Hebrew teacher also used thus to teach, that as the beginning or end of all things could be comprehended by no one, save only our Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit, so under the form of a vision Isaiah spake of two seraphim alone, who with two wings cover the countenance of God, and with two His feet, and with two do fly, calling to each other alternately, and saying, \"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of Sabaoth; the whole earth is full of Thy glory.\"[fn-73-P7346_1679510:16-nf] That the seraphim alone have both their wings over the face of God, and over His feet, we venture to declare as meaning that neither the hosts of holy angels, nor the \"holy seats,\" nor the \"dominions,\" nor the \"principalities,\" nor the \"powers,\" can fully understand the beginning of all things, and the limits of the universe. But we are to understand that those \"saints\" whom the Spirit has enrolled, and the \"virtues,\" approach very closely to those very beginnings, and attain to a height which the others cannot reach; and yet whatever it be that these \"virtues\" have learned through revelation from the Son of God and from the Holy Spirit-and they will certainly be able to learn very much, and those of higher rank much more than those of a lower-nevertheless it is impossible for them to comprehend all things, according to the statement, \"The most part of the works of God are hid.\"[fn-73-P7347_1680419:17-nf] And therefore also it is to be desired that every one, according to his strength, should ever stretch out to those things that are before, \"forgetting the things that are behind,\" both to better works and to a clearer apprehension and understanding, through Jesus Christ our Saviour, to whom be glory for ever!","title":"Book IV.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":41,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_38_letter_of_an_inquirer_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"§20.

And\nhesaid:-A little horn arose from between those ten and three fell before it.[fn-41-P4120_1371325:62-nf] For when Antiochus arose in the kingdom, he\nhumbled three kings, and he exalted himself against the saints of the Most High and against\nJerusalem.

Again he said:-The judgment was set and they\ntook away his authority from him, to injure and destroy him until the end of the kingdom.[fn-41-P4130_1373440:72-nf] For the judgment came upon Antiochus, a judgment\nfrom heaven;[fn-41-P4131_1373520:73-nf] and he became sick with a\ngrievous and evil sickness, and on account of the smell of him as he rotted, no man could approach\nhim, for worms were crawling and falling from him and eating his flesh because he oppressed the\nworm Jacob.[fn-41-P4132_1373776:74-nf] And his flesh rotted in\nhis lifetime, because he caused the dead bodies of the sons of Jerusalem to rot and they were not\nburied.
