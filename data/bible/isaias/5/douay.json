{"verses":["I will sing to my beloved the canticle of my cousin concerning his\nvineyard.  My beloved had a vineyard on a hill in a fruitful place.","And he fenced it in, and picked the stones out of it, and planted\nit with the choicest vines, and built a tower in the midst thereof, and\nset up a winepress therein:  and he looked that it should bring forth\ngrapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.","And now, O ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and ye men of Juda, judge\nbetween me and my vineyard.","What is there that I ought to do more to my vineyard, that I have\nnot done to it?  was it that I looked that it should bring forth grapes,\nand it hath brought forth wild grapes?","And now I will shew you what I will do to my vineyard.  I will take\naway the hedge thereof, and it shall be wasted:  I will break down the\nwall thereof, and it shall be trodden down.","And I will make it desolate:  it shall not be pruned, and it shall\nnot be digged:  but briers and thorns shall come up:  and I will command\nthe clouds to rain no rain upon it.","For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel:  and\nthe man of Juda, his pleasant plant:  and I looked that he should do\njudgment, and behold iniquity:  and do justice, and behold a cry.","Woe to you that join house to house and lay field to field, even\nto the end of the place:  shall you alone dwell in the midst of the\nearth?","These things are in my ears, saith the Lord of hosts:  Unless many\ngreat and fair houses shall become desolate, without an inhabitant.","For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one little measure, and\nthirty bushels of seed shall yield three bushels.","Woe to you that rise up early in the morning to follow\ndrunkenness, and to drink in the evening, to be inflamed with wine.","The harp, and the lyre, and, the timbrel and the pipe, and wine\nare in your feasts:  and the work of the Lord you regard not, nor do you\nconsider the works of his hands.","Therefore is my people led away captive, because they had not\nknowledge, and their nobles have perished with famine, and their\nmultitude were dried up with thirst.","Therefore hath hell enlarged her soul, and opened her mouth\nwithout any bounds, and their strong ones, and their people, and their\nhigh and glorious ones shall go down into it.","And man shall be brought down, and man shall be humbled, and the\neyes of the lofty shall be brought low.","And the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and the holy\nGod shall be sanctified in justice.","And the lambs shall feed according to their order, and strangers\nshall eat the deserts turned into fruitfulness.","Woe to you that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as\nthe rope of a cart.","That say:  Let him make haste, and let his work come quickly, that\nwe may see it:  and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel come, that\nwe may know it.","Woe to you that call evil good, and good evil:  that put darkness\nfor light, and light for darkness:  that put bitter for sweet, and sweet\nfor bitter.","Woe to you that are wise in your own eyes, and prudent in your\nown conceits.","Woe to you that are mighty to drink wine, and stout men at\ndrunkenness.","That justify the wicked for gifts, and take away the justice of\nthe just from him.","Therefore as the tongue of the fire devoureth the stubble, and\nthe heat of the flame consumeth it:  so shall their root be as ashes,\nand their bud shall go up as dust:  for they have cast away the law of\nthe Lord of hosts, and have blasphemed the word of the Holy One of\nIsrael.","Therefore is the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people,\nand he hath stretched out his hand upon them, and struck them:  and the\nmountains were troubles, and their carcasses became as dung in the\nmidst of the streets.  For after this his anger is not turned away, but\nhis hand is stretched out still.","And he will lift up a sign to the nations afar off, and will\nwhistle to them from the ends of the earth:  and behold they shall come\nwith speed swiftly.","There is none that shall faint, nor labour among them:  they shall\nnot slumber nor sleep, neither shall the girdle of their loins be\nloosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken.","Their arrows are sharp, and all their bows are bent.  The hoofs of\ntheir horses shall be like the flint, and their wheels like the\nviolence of a tempest.","Their roaring like that of a lion, they shall roar like young\nlions:  yea they shall roar, and take hold of the prey, and they shall\nkeep fast hold of it, and there shall be none to deliver it.","And they shall make a noise against them that day, like the\nroaring of the sea; we shall look towards the land, and behold darkness\nof tribulation, and the light is darkened with the mist thereof."]}
