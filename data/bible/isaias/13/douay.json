{"verses":["The burden of Babylon which Isaias the son of Amos saw.","Upon the dark mountain lift ye up a banner, exalt the voice, lift\nup the hand, and let the rulers go into the gates.","I have commanded my sanctified ones, and have called my strong\nones in my wrath, them that rejoice in my glory.","The noise of a multitude in the mountains, as it were of many\npeople, the noise of the sound of kings, of nations gathered together:\nthe Lord of hosts hath given charge to the troops of war.","To them that come from a country afar off, from the end of\nheaven:  the Lord and the instruments of his wrath, to destroy the whole\nland.","Howl ye, for the day of the Lord is near:  it shall come as a\ndestruction from the Lord.","Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every heart of man shall\nmelt,","And shall be broken.  Gripings and pains, shall take hold of them,\nthey shall be in pain as a woman in labour.  Every one shall be amazed\nat his neighbour, their countenances shall be as faces burnt.","Behold, the day of the Lord shall come, a cruel day, and full of\nindignation, and of wrath, and fury, to lay the land desolate, and to\ndestroy the sinners thereof out of it.","For the stars of heaven, and their brightness shall not display\ntheir light:  the sun shall be darkened in his rising, and the moon\nshall not shine with her light.","And I will visit the evils of the world, and against the wicked\nfor their iniquity:  and I will make the pride of infidels to cease, and\nwill bring down the arrogancy of the mighty.","A man shall be more precious than gold, yea a man than the\nfinest of gold.","For this I will trouble the heaven:  and the earth shall be moved\nout of her place, for the indignation of the Lord of hosts, and for the\nday of his fierce wrath.","And they shall be as a doe fleeing away, and as a sheep:  and\nthere shall be none to gather them together:  every man shall turn to\nhis own people, and every one shall flee to his own land.","Every one that shall be found, shall be slain:  and every one\nthat shall come to their aid, shall fall by the sword.","Their inhabitants shall be dashed in pieces before their eyes:\ntheir houses shall be pillaged, and their wives shall be ravished.","Behold I will stir up the Medes against them, who shall not seek\nsilver, nor desire gold:","But with their arrows they shall kill the children, and shall\nhave no pity upon the sucklings of the womb, and their eye shall not\nspare their sons.","And that Babylon, glorious among kingdoms, the famous pride of\nthe Chaldeans, shall be even as the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrha.","It shall no more be inhabited for ever, and it shall not be\nfounded unto generation and generation:  neither shall the Arabian pitch\nhis tents there, nor shall shepherds rest there.","But wild beasts shall rest there, and their houses shall be\nfilled with serpents, and ostriches shall dwell there, and the hairy\nones shall dance there:","And owls shall answer one another there, in the houses thereof,\nand sirens in the temples of pleasure."]}
