Equally so (in this case as in the former), the man who is shown to bear that character will be the very Christ who is come.

My opponent has dared to maintain that our Lord was called by the Pharisees a wine-bibber and a glutton: and from the fact of His going to marriage feasts and from His not despising the banquets of sinners, I am to infer His wishes respecting ourselves. That Lord, so you suppose, is a glutton who fasted forty days to hallow Christian fasting;[fn-67-P6779_2142794:168-nf] who calls them blessed that hunger and thirst;[fn-67-P6780_2142863:169-nf] who says that He has food, not that which the disciples surmised, but such as would not perish for ever;[fn-67-P6781_2142991:170-nf] who forbids us to think of the morrow; who, though He is said to have hungered and thirsted, and to have gone frequently to various meals, except in celebrating the mystery whereby He represented His passion, or[fn-67-P6782_2143264:171-nf] in proving the reality of His body is nowhere described as ministering to His appetite;[fn-67-P6783_2143394:172-nf] who tells of purple-clad Dives in hell for his feasting, and says that poor Lazarus for his abstinence was in Abraham's bosom; who, when we fast,[fn-67-P6784_2143566:173-nf] bids us anoint our head and wash our face, that we fast not to gain glory from men, but praise from the Lord; who did indeed[fn-67-P6785_2143731:174-nf] after His resurrection eat part of a broiled fish and of a honey-comb, not to allay hunger and to gratify His palate, but to show the reality of a His own body. For whenever He raised anyone from the dead He[fn-67-P6786_2143957:175-nf] ordered that food should be given him to eat, lest the resurrection should be thought a delusion. And this is why Lazarus after his resurrection is[fn-67-P6787_2144263:176-nf] described as being at the feast with our Lord. We do not deny that fish and other kinds of flesh, if we choose, may be taken as food; but as we prefer virginity to marriage, so do we esteem fasting and spirituality above meats and full-bloodedness. And if Peter[fn-67-P6788_2144548:177-nf] before dinner went to the supper chamber at the sixth hour, a chance fit of hunger does not prejudice fasting. For, if this were so, because our Lord[fn-67-P6789_2144748:178-nf] at the sixth hour sat weary on the well of Samaria and wished to drink, all must of necessity, whether they so desire or not, drink at that time. Possibly it was the Sabbath, or the Lord's day, and he hungered at the sixth hour after two or three days' fasting; for I could never believe that the Apostle, if he had eaten a dinner only one day previous and had been blown out with a great meal, would have been hungry by noon next day. But if he did dine the day previous, and was hungry next day before luncheon, I do not think that a man who was so soon hungry ate until he was satisfied. Again, God by the mouth of Isaiah says what fast He did not choose:[fn-67-P6790_2145430:179-nf] \"In the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and afflict the lowly: ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness. it is not such a fast that I have chosen, saith the Lord.\" What kind He has chosen He thus teaches: \"Deal thy bread to the hungry, and bring the houseless poor into thy house. When thou seest the naked cover him, and hide not thyself from thine own flesh.\" He did not therefore reject fasting, but showed what He would have it to be: for that bodily hunger is not pleasing to God which is made null and void by strife, and plunder, and lust. If God does not desire fasting, how is it that in[fn-67-P6791_2146086:180-nf] Leviticus He commands the whole people in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, to fast until the evening, and threatens that he who does not afflict his soul shall die and be cut off from his people? How is it that the[fn-67-P6792_2146334:181-nf] graves of lust where the people fell in their devotion to flesh remain even to this day in the wilderness? Do we not read that the stupid people gorged themselves with quails until the wrath of God came upon them? Why was the man of God at whose prophecy the hand of King Jeroboam withered, and who ate contrary to the command of God,[fn-67-P6793_2146738:182-nf] immediately smitten? Strange that the lion which left the ass safe and sound should not spare the prophet just risen from his meal!He who, while he was fasting, had wrought miracles, no sooner ate a meal than he paid the penalty for the gratification. Joel also cries aloud:[fn-67-P6794_2147038:183-nf] \"Sanctify a fast, proclaim a time of healing,\" that it might appear that a fast is sanctified by other works, and that a holy fast avails for the cure of sin. Moreover, just as true virginity is not prejudiced by the counterfeit professions of the virgins of the devil, so neither is true fasting by the periodic fast and perpetual abstinence from certain kinds of food on the part of the worshippers of Isis and Cybele, particularly when a fast from bread is made up for by feasting on flesh. And just as the signs of Moses were imitated by the signs of the Egyptians which were in reality no signs at all, for the rod of Moses swallowed up the rods of the magicians: so when the devil tries to be the rival of God this does not prove that our religion is superstitious, but that we are negligent, since we refuse to do what even men of the world see clearly to be good.","title":"Book II.","author":false},{"chapter":58,"verse":5,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_20_commandment_tenth","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"ANF-02","text":"\"Hear, then,\" says he, \"foolish man, how grief crushes out the Holy Spirit, and on the other hand saves.

Nor could there be any discussion about His annulling[fn-56-P5643_1725409:373-nf] the Sabbath, if He had a right[fn-56-P5644_1725463:374-nf] to annul it. Moreover, He would have the right, if He belonged to the rival god; nor would it cause surprise to any one that He did what it was right for Him to do. Men's astonishment therefore arose from their opinion that it was improper for Him to proclaim the Creator to be God and yet to impugn His Sabbath. Now, that we may decide these several points first, lest we should be renewing them at every turn to meet each argument of our adversary which rests on some novel institution[fn-56-P5645_1725967:375-nf] of Christ, let this stand as a settled point, that discussion concerning the novel character of each institution ensued on this account, because as nothing was as yet advanced by Christ touching any new deity, so discussion thereon was inadmissible; nor could it be retorted, that from the very novelty of each several institution another deity was clearly enough demonstrated by Christ, inasmuch as it was plain that novelty was not in itself a characteristic to be wondered at in Christ, because it had been foretold by the Creator. And it would have been, of course, but right that a new[fn-56-P5646_1726602:376-nf] god should first be expounded, and his discipline be introduced afterwards; because it Would be the god that would impart authority to the discipline, and not the discipline to the god; except that (to be sure) it has happened that Marcion acquired his very perverse opinions not from a master, but his master from his opinion! All other points respecting the Sabbath I thus rule. If Christ interfered with[fn-56-P5647_1727023:377-nf] the Sabbath, He simply acted after the Creator's example; inasmuch as in the siege of the city of Jericho the carrying around the walls of the ark of the covenant for eight days running, and therefore on a Sabbath-day, actually[fn-56-P5648_1727271:378-nf] annulled the Sabbath, by the Creator's command-according to the opinion of those who think this of Christ in this passage of St. Luke, in their ignorance that neither Christ nor the Creator violated the Sabbath, as we shall by and by show. And yet the Sabbath was actually then broken[fn-56-P5649_1727575:379-nf] by Joshua,[fn-56-P5650_1727617:380-nf] so that the present charge might be alleged also against Christ. But even if, as being not the Christ of the Jews, He displayed a hatred against the Jews' most solemn day, He was only professedly following[fn-56-P5651_1727841:381-nf] the Creator, as being His Christ, in this very hatred of the Sabbath; for He exclaims by the mouth of Isaiah: \"Your new moons and your Sabbaths my soul hateth.\"[fn-56-P5652_1728031:382-nf] Now, in whatever sense these words were spoken, we know that an abrupt defence must, in a subject of this sort, be used in answer to an abrupt challenge. I shall now transfer the discussion to the very matter in which the teaching of Christ seemed to annul the Sabbath. The disciples had been hungry; on that the Sabbath day they had plucked some ears and rubbed them in their hands; by thus preparing their food, they had violated the holy day. Christ excuses them, and became their accomplice in breaking the Sabbath. The Pharisees bring the charge against Him. Marcion sophistically interprets the stages of the controversy (if I may call in the aid of the truth of my Lord to ridicule his arts), both in the scriptural record and in Christ's purpose.[fn-56-P5653_1728805:383-nf] For from the Creator's Scripture, and from the purpose of Christ, there is derived a colourable precedent[fn-56-P5654_1729263:384-nf] -as from the example of David, when he went into the temple on the Sabbath, and provided food by boldly breaking up the shew-bread.[fn-56-P5655_1729417:385-nf] Even he remembered that this privilege (I mean the dispensation from fasting) was allowed to the Sabbath from the very beginning, when the Sabbath-day itself was instituted. For although the Creator had forbidden that the manna should be gathered for two days, He yet permitted it on the one occasion only of the day before the Sabbath, in order that the yesterday's provision of food might free from fasting the feast of the following Sabbath-day. Good reason, therefore, had the Lord for pursuing the same principle in the annulling of the Sabbath (since that is the word which men will use); good reason, too, for expressing the Creator's will,[fn-56-P5656_1730104:386-nf] when He bestowed the privilege of not fasting on the Sabbath-day. In short, He would have then and there[fn-56-P5657_1730226:387-nf] put an end to the Sabbath, nay, to the Creator Himself, if He had commanded His disciples to fast on the Sabbath-day, contrary to the intention[fn-56-P5658_1730389:388-nf] of the Scripture and of the Creator's will. But because He did not directly defend[fn-56-P5659_1730487:389-nf] His disciples, but excuses them; because He interposes human want, as if deprecating censure; because He maintains the honour of the Sabbath as a day which is to be free from gloom rather than from work;[fn-56-P5660_1730723:390-nf] because he puts David and his companions on a level with His own disciples in their fault and their extenuation; because He is pleased to endorse[fn-56-P5661_1730908:391-nf] the Creator's indulgence:[fn-56-P5662_1731004:392-nf] because He is Himself good according to His example-is He therefore alien from the Creator? Then the Pharisees watch whether He would heal on the Sabbath-day,[fn-56-P5663_1731205:393-nf] that they might accuse Him-surely as a violator of the Sabbath, not as the propounder of a new god; for perhaps I might be content with insisting on all occasions on this one point, that another Christ[fn-56-P5664_1731426:394-nf] is nowhere proclaimed. The Pharisees, however, were in utter error concerning the law of the Sabbath, not observing that its terms were conditional, when it enjoined rest from labour, making certain distinctions of labour. For when it says of the Sabbath-day, \"In it thou shalt not do any work of thine,\"[fn-56-P5665_1731774:395-nf] by the word thine[fn-56-P5666_1731811:396-nf] it restricts the prohibition to human work-which every one performs in his own employment or business-and not to divine work. Now the work of healing or preserving is not proper to man, but to God. So again, in the law it says, \"Thou shalt not do any manner of work in it,\"[fn-56-P5667_1732452:397-nf] except what is to be done for any soul,[fn-56-P5668_1732512:398-nf] that is to say, in the matter of delivering the soul;[fn-56-P5669_1732887:399-nf] because what is God's work may be done by human agency for the salvation of the soul. By God, however, would that be done which the man Christ was to do, for He was likewise God.[fn-56-P5670_1733113:400-nf] Wishing, therefore, to initiate them into this meaning of the law by the restoration of the withered hand, He requires, \"Is it lawful on the Sabbath-days to do good, or not? to save life, or to destroy it? \"[fn-56-P5671_1733368:401-nf] In order that He might, whilst allowing that amount of work which He was about to perform for a soul,[fn-56-P5672_1733489:402-nf] remind them what works the law of the Sabbath forbade-even human works; and what it enjoined-even divine works, which might be done for the benefit of any soul,[fn-56-P5673_1733684:403-nf] He was called \"Lord of the Sabbath,\"[fn-56-P5674_1733755:404-nf] because He maintained[fn-56-P5675_1733796:405-nf] the Sabbath as His own institution. Now, even if He had annulled the Sabbath, He would have had the right to do so,[fn-56-P5676_1733929:406-nf] as being its Lord, (and) still more as He who instituted it. But He did not utterly destroy it, although its Lord, in order that it might henceforth be plain that the Sabbath was not broken[fn-56-P5677_1734134:407-nf] by the Creator, even at the time when the ark was carried around Jericho. For that was really[fn-56-P5678_1734330:408-nf] God's work, which He commanded Himself, and which He had ordered for the sake of the lives of His servants when exposed to the perils of war. Now, although He has in a certain place expressed an aversion of Sabbaths, by calling them your Sabbaths,[fn-56-P5679_1734589:409-nf] reckoning them as men's Sabbaths, not His own, because they were celebrated without the fear of God by a people full of iniquities, and loving God \"with the lip, not the heart,\"[fn-56-P5680_1734790:410-nf] He has yet put His own Sabbaths (those, that is, which were kept according to His prescription) in a different position; for by the same prophet, in a later passage,[fn-56-P5681_1734978:411-nf] He declared them to be \"true, and delightful, and inviolable.\" Thus Christ did not at all rescind the Sabbath: He kept the law thereof, and both in the former case did a work which was beneficial to the life of His disciples, for He indulged them with the relief of food when they were hungry, and in the present instance cured the withered hand; in each case intimating by facts, \"I came not to destroy, the law, but to fulfil it,\"[fn-56-P5682_1735446:412-nf] although Marcion has gagged[fn-56-P5683_1735494:413-nf] His mouth by this word.[fn-56-P5684_1735536:414-nf] For even in the case before us He fulfilled the law, while interpreting its condition; moreover, He exhibits in a dear light the different kinds of work, while doing what the law excepts from the sacredness of the Sabbath[fn-56-P5685_1735925:415-nf] and while imparting to the Sabbath-day itself, which from the beginning had been consecrated by the benediction of the Father, an additional sanctity by His own beneficent action. For He furnished to this day divine safeguards,[fn-56-P5686_1736213:416-nf] -a course which[fn-56-P5687_1736247:417-nf] His adversary would have pursued for some other days, to avoid honouring the Creator's Sabbath, and restoring to the Sabbath the works which were proper for it. Since, in like manner, the prophet Elisha on this day restored to life the dead son of the Shunammite woman,[fn-56-P5688_1736576:418-nf] you see, O Pharisee, and you too, O Marcion, how that it was proper employment for the Creator's Sabbaths of old[fn-56-P5689_1736716:419-nf] to do good, to save life, not to destroy it; how that Christ introduced nothing new, which was not after the example,[fn-56-P5690_1736847:420-nf] the gentleness, the mercy, and the prediction also of the Creator. For in this very example He fulfils[fn-56-P5691_1736964:421-nf] the prophetic announcement of a specific healing: \"The weak hands are strengthened,\" as were also \"the feeble knees\"[fn-56-P5692_1737102:422-nf] in the sick of the palsy.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":58,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"81","folder":"ANF-03","text":"\"But I say unto you which hear\" (displaying here that old injunction, of the Creator: \"Speak to the ears of those who lend them to you\"[fn-58-P5837_1767307:554-nf] ), \"Love your enemies, and bless[fn-58-P5838_1767389:555-nf] those which hate you, and pray for them which calumniate you.\"[fn-58-P5839_1767528:556-nf] These commands the Creator included in one precept by His prophet Isaiah: \"Say, Ye are our brethren, to those who hate you.\"[fn-58-P5840_1767737:557-nf] For if they who are our enemies, and hate us, and speak evil of us, and calumniate us, are to be called our brethren, surely He did in effect bid us bless them that hate us, and pray for them who calumniate us, when He instructed us to reckon them as brethren. Well, but Christ plainly teaches a new kind of patience,[fn-58-P5841_1768076:558-nf] when He actually prohibits the reprisals which the Creator permitted in requiring \"an eye for an eye,[fn-58-P5842_1768296:559-nf] and a tooth for a tooth,\"[fn-58-P5843_1768491:560-nf] and bids us, on the contrary, \"to him who smiteth us on the one cheek, to offer the other also, and to give up our coat to him that taketh away our cloak.\"[fn-58-P5844_1768667:561-nf] No doubt these are supplementary additions by Christ, but they are quite in keeping with the teaching of the Creator. And therefore this question must at once be determined,[fn-58-P5845_1768861:562-nf] Whether the discipline of patience be enjoined by[fn-58-P5846_1768936:563-nf] the Creator? When by Zechariah He commanded, \"Let none of you imagine evil against his brother,\"[fn-58-P5847_1769047:564-nf] He did not expressly include his neighbour; but then in another passage He says, \"Let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour.\"[fn-58-P5848_1769219:565-nf] He who counselled that an injury should be forgotten, was still more likely to counsel the patient endurance of it. But then, when He said, \"Vengeance is mine, and I will repay,\"[fn-58-P5849_1769421:566-nf] He thereby teaches that patience calmly waits for the infliction of vengeance. Therefore, inasmuch as it is incredible[fn-58-P5850_1769599:567-nf] that the same (God) should seem to require \"a tooth for a tooth and an eye for an eye,\" in return for an injury, who forbids not only all reprisals, but even a revengeful thought or recollection of an injury, in so far does it become plain to us in what sense He required \"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,\"-not, indeed, for the purpose of permitting the repetition of the injury by retaliating it, which it virtually prohibited when it forbade vengeance; but for the purpose of restraining the injury in the first instance, which it had forbidden on pain of retaliation or reciprocity;[fn-58-P5851_1770219:568-nf] so that every man, in view of the permission to inflict a second (or retaliatory) injury, might abstain from the commission of the first (or provocative) wrong. For He knows how much more easy it is to repress violence by the prospect of retaliation, than by the promise of (indefinite) vengeance. Both results, however, it was necessary to provide, in consideration of the nature and the faith of men, that the man who believed in God might expect vengeance from God, while he who had no faith (to restrain him) might fear the laws which prescribed retaliation.[fn-58-P5852_1770808:569-nf] This purpose[fn-58-P5853_1770881:570-nf] of the law, which it was difficult to understand, Christ, as the Lord of the Sabbath and of the law, and of all the dispensations of the Father, both revealed and made intelligible,[fn-58-P5854_1771082:571-nf] when He commanded that \"the other cheek should be offered (to the smiter),\" in order that He might the more effectually extinguish all reprisals of an injury, which the law had wished to prevent by the method of retaliation, (and) which most certainly revelation[fn-58-P5855_1771407:572-nf] had manifestly restricted, both by prohibiting the memory of the wrong, and referring the vengeance thereof to God. Thus, whatever (new provision) Christ introduced, He did it not in opposition to the law, but rather in furtherance of it, without at all impairing the prescription[fn-58-P5856_1771707:573-nf] of the Creator. If, therefore,[fn-58-P5857_1771773:574-nf] one looks carefully[fn-58-P5858_1771809:575-nf] into the very grounds for which patience is enjoined (and that to such a full and complete extent), one finds that it cannot stand if it is not the precept of the Creator, who promises vengeance, who presents Himself as the judge (in the case). If it were not so,[fn-58-P5859_1772143:576-nf] -if so vast a weight of patience-which is to refrain from giving blow for blow; which is to offer the other cheek; which is not only not to return railing for railing, but contrariwise blessing; and which, so far from keeping the coat, is to give up the cloak also-is laid upon me by one who means not to help me,-(then all I can say is, ) he has taught me patience to no purpose,[fn-58-P5860_1772541:577-nf] because he shows me no reward to his precept-I mean no fruit of such patience. There is revenge which he ought to have permitted me to take, if he meant not to inflict it himself; if he did not give me that permission, then he should himself have inflicted it;[fn-58-P5861_1772820:578-nf] since it is for the interest of discipline itself that an injury should be avenged. For by the fear of vengeance all iniquity is curbed. But if licence is allowed to it without discrimination,[fn-58-P5862_1773057:579-nf] it will get the mastery-it will put out (a man's) both eyes; it will knock out[fn-58-P5863_1773151:580-nf] every tooth in the safety of its impunity. This, however, is (the principle) of your good and simply beneficent god-to do a wrong to patience, to open the door to violence, to leave the righteous undefended, and the wicked unrestrained! \"Give to every one that asketh of thee\"[fn-58-P5864_1773447:581-nf] -to the indigent of course, or rather to the indigent more especially, although to the affluent likewise. But in order that no man may be indigent, you have in Deuteronomy a provision commanded by the Creator to the creditor.[fn-58-P5865_1773693:582-nf] \"There shall not be in thine hand an indigent man; so that the Lord thy God shall bless thee with blessings,\"[fn-58-P5866_1773818:583-nf] -thee meaning the creditor to whom it was owing that the man was not indigent. But more than this. To one who does not ask, He bids a gift to be given. \"Let there be, not,\" He says, \"a poor man in thine hand; \"in other words, see that there be not, so far as thy will can prevent;[fn-58-P5867_1774143:584-nf] by which command, too, He all the more strongly by inference requires[fn-58-P5868_1774239:585-nf] men to give to him that asks, as in the following words also: \"If there be among you a poor man of thy brethren, thou shalt not turn away thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother. But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him as much as he wanteth,\"[fn-58-P5869_1774549:586-nf] Loans are not usually given, except to such as ask for them. On this subject of lending,[fn-58-P5870_1774661:587-nf] however, more hereafter.[fn-58-P5871_1774704:588-nf] Now, should any one wish to argue that the Creator's precepts extended only to a man's brethren, but Christ's to all that ask, so as to make the latter a new and different precept, (I have to reply) that one rule only can be made out of those principles, which show the law of the Creator to be repeated in Christ.[fn-58-P5872_1775054:589-nf] For that is not a different thing which Christ enjoined to be done towards all men, from that which the Creator prescribed in favour of a man's brethren. For although that is a greater charity, which is shown to strangers, it is yet not preferable to that[fn-58-P5873_1775413:590-nf] which was previously due to one's neighbours. For what man will be able to bestow the love (which proceeds from knowledge of character,[fn-58-P5874_1775566:591-nf] upon strangers? Since, however, the second step[fn-58-P5875_1776029:592-nf] in charity is towards strangers, while the first is towards one's neighbours, the second step will belong to him to whom the first also belongs, more fitly than the second will belong to him who owned no first.[fn-58-P5876_1776255:593-nf] Accordingly, the Creator, when following the course of nature, taught in the first instance kindness to neighbours,[fn-58-P5877_1776404:594-nf] intending afterwards to enjoin it towards strangers; and when following the method of His dispensation, He limited charity first to the Jews, but afterwards extended it to the whole race of mankind. So long, therefore, as the mystery of His government[fn-58-P5878_1776676:595-nf] was confined to Israel, He properly commanded that pity should be shown only to a man's brethren; but when Christ had given to Him \"the Gentiles for His heritage, and the ends of the earth for His possession,\" then began to be accomplished what was said by Hosea: \"Ye are not my people, who were my people; ye have not obtained mercy, who once obtained mercy\"[fn-58-P5879_1777057:596-nf] -that is, the (Jewish) nation. Thenceforth Christ extended to all men the law of His Father's compassion, excepting none from His mercy, as He omitted none in His invitation. So that, whatever was the ampler scope of His teaching, He received it all in His heritage of the nations. \"And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.\"[fn-58-P5880_1777469:597-nf] In this command is no doubt implied its counterpart: \"And as ye would not that men should do to you, so should ye also not do to them likewise.\" Now, if this were the teaching of the new and previously unknown and not yet fully proclaimed deity, who had favoured me with no instruction beforehand, whereby I might first learn what I ought to choose or to refuse for myself, and to do to others what I would wish done to myself, not doing to them what I should be unwilling to have done to myself, it would certainly be nothing else than the chance-medley of my own sentiments[fn-58-P5881_1778065:598-nf] which he would have left to me, binding me to no proper rule of wish or action, in order that I might do to others what I would like for myself, or refrain from doing to others what I should dislike to have done to myself. For he has not, in fact, defined what I ought to wish or not to wish for myself as well as for others, so that I shape my conduct[fn-58-P5882_1778455:599-nf] according to the law of my own will, and have it in my power[fn-58-P5883_1778537:600-nf] not to render[fn-58-P5884_1778566:601-nf] to another what I would like to have rendered to myself-love, obedience, consolation, protection, and such like blessings; and in like manner to do to another what I should be unwilling to have done to myself-violence, wrong, insult, deceit, and evils of like sort. Indeed, the heathen who have not been instructed by God act on this incongruous liberty of the will and the conduct.[fn-58-P5885_1778967:602-nf] For although good and evil are severally known by nature, yet life is not thereby spent[fn-58-P5886_1779119:603-nf] under the discipline of God, which alone at last teaches men the proper liberty of their will and action in faith, asin the fear of God. The god of Marcion, therefore, although specially revealed, was, in spite of his revelation, unable to publish any summary of the precept in question, which had hitherto been so confined,[fn-58-P5887_1779463:604-nf] and obscure, and dark, and admitting of no ready interpretation, except according to my own arbitrary thought,[fn-58-P5888_1779591:605-nf] because he had provided no previous discrimination in the matter of such a precept. This, however, was not the case with my God[fn-58-P5889_1779744:606-nf] for He always and everywhere enjoined that the poor, and the orphan, and the widow should be protected, assisted, refreshed; thus by Isaiah He says: \"Deal thy bread to the hungry, and them that are houseless bring into thine house; when thou seest the naked, cover him.\"[fn-58-P5890_1780054:607-nf] By Ezekiel also He thus describes the just man: \"His bread will he give to the hungry, and the naked will he cover with a garment.\"[fn-58-P5891_1780208:608-nf] That teaching was even then a sufficient inducement to me to do to others what I would that they should do unto me. Accordingly, when He uttered such denunciations as, \"Thou shalt do no murder; thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness,\" He taught me to refrain from doing to others what I should be unwilling to have done to myself; and therefore the precept developed in the Gospel will belong to Him alone, who anciently drew it up, and gave it distinctive point, and arranged it after the decision of His own teaching, and has now reduced it, suitably to its importance,[fn-58-P5892_1780852:609-nf] to a compendious formula, because (as it was predicted in another passage) the Lord-that is, Christ\" was to make (or utter) a concise word on earth.\"[fn-58-P5893_1781017:610-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":58,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"83","folder":"ANF-03","text":"And now, on the subject of a loan, when He asks, \"And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? \"[fn-58-P5897_1781657:611-nf] compare with this the following words of Ezekiel, in which He says of the before-mentioned just man, \"He hath not given his money upon usury, nor will he take any increase\"[fn-58-P5898_1781892:612-nf] -meaning the redundance of interest,[fn-58-P5899_1782001:613-nf] which is usury. The first step was to eradicate the fruit of the money lent,[fn-59-P5900_1782123:614-nf] the more easily to accustom a man to the loss, should it happen, of the money itself, the interest of which he had learnt to lose. Now this, we affirm, was the function of the law as preparatory to the gospel. It was engaged in forming the faith of such as would learn,[fn-59-P5901_1782432:615-nf] by gradual stages, for the perfect light of the Christian discipline, through the best precepts of which it was capable,[fn-59-P5902_1782582:616-nf] inculcating a benevolence which as yet expressed itself but falteringly.[fn-59-P5903_1782691:617-nf] For in the passage of Ezekiel quoted above He says, \"And thou shalt restore the pledge of the loan \"[fn-59-P5904_1782850:618-nf] -to him, certainly, who is incapable of repayment, because, as a matter of course, He would not anyhow prescribe the restoration of a pledge to one who was solvent. Much more clearly is it enjoined in Deuteronomy: \"Thou shalt not sleep upon his pledge; thou shalt be sure to return to him his garment about sunset, and he shall sleep in his own garment.\"[fn-59-P5905_1783294:619-nf] Clearer still is a former passage: \"Thou shalt remit every debt which thy neighbour oweth thee; and of thy brother thou shalt not require it, because it is called the release of the Lord thy God.\"[fn-59-P5906_1783518:620-nf] Now, when He commands that a debt be remitted to a man who shall be unable to pay it (for it is a still stronger argument when He forbids its being asked for from a man who is even able to repay it), what else does He teach than that we should lend to those of whom we cannot receive again, inasmuch as He has imposed so great a loss on lending? \"And ye shall be the children of God.\"[fn-59-P5907_1783923:621-nf] What can be more shameless, than for him to be making us his children, who has not permitted us to make children for ourselves by forbidding marriage?[fn-59-P5908_1784148:622-nf] How does he propose to invest his followers with a name which he has already erased? I cannot be the son of a eunuch Especially when I have for my Father the same great Being whom the universe claims for its! For is not the Founder of the universe as much a Father, even of all men, as (Marcion's) castrated deity,[fn-59-P5909_1784546:623-nf] who is the maker of no existing thing? Even if the Creator had not united male and female, and if He had not allowed any living creature whatever to have children, I yet had this relation to Him[fn-59-P5910_1784760:624-nf] before Paradise, before the fall, before the expulsion, before the two became one.[fn-59-P5911_1784865:625-nf] I became His son a second time,[fn-59-P5912_1785018:626-nf] as soon as He fashioned me[fn-59-P5913_1785059:627-nf] with His hands, and gave me motion with His inbreathing. Now again He names me His son, not begetting me into natural life, but into spiritual life.[fn-59-P5914_1785230:628-nf] \"Because,\" says He, \"He is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.\"[fn-59-P5915_1785338:629-nf] Well done,[fn-59-P5916_1785369:630-nf] Marcion! how cleverly have you withdrawn from Him the showers and the sunshine, that He might not seem to be a Creator! But who is this kind being[fn-59-P5917_1785529:631-nf] which hitherto has not been even known? How can he be kind who had previously shown no evidences of such a kindness as this, which consists of the loan to us of sunshine and rain?-who is not destined to receive from the human race (the homage due to that) Creator,-who, up to this very moment, in return for His vast liberality in the gift of the elements, bears with men while they offer to idols, more readily than Himself, the due returns of His graciousness. But God is truly kind even in spiritual blessings. \"The utterances[fn-59-P5918_1786074:632-nf] of the Lord are sweeter than honey and honeycombs.\"[fn-59-P5919_1786142:633-nf] He then has taunted[fn-59-P5920_1786182:634-nf] men as ungrateful who deserved to have their gratitude-even He, whose sunshine and rain even you, O Marcion, have enjoyed, but without gratitude! Your god, however, had no right to complain of man's ingratitude, because he had used no means to make them grateful. Compassion also does He teach: \"Be ye merciful,\" says He, \"as your Father also that had mercy upon you.\"[fn-59-P5921_1786571:635-nf] This injunction will be of a piece with, \"Deal thy bread to the hungry; and if he be houseless, bring him into thine house; and if thou seest the naked, cover him; \"[fn-59-P5922_1786768:636-nf] also with, \"Judge the fatherless, plead with the widow.\"[fn-59-P5923_1786847:637-nf] I recognise here that ancient doctrine of Him who \"prefers mercy to sacrifice.\"[fn-59-P5924_1786946:638-nf] If, however, it be now some other being which teaches mercy, on the ground of his own mercifulness, how happens it that he has been wanting in mercy to me for so vast an age? \"Judge not, and ye shall not be judged; condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned; forgive, and ye shall be forgiven; give, and it shall be given unto you: good measure, pressed down, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye measure withal, it shall be measured to you again.\"[fn-59-P5925_1787462:639-nf] As it seems to me, this passage announces a retribution proportioned to the merits. But from whom shall come the retribution? If only from men, in that case he teaches a merely human discipline and recompense; and in everything we shall have to obey man: if from the Creator, as the Judge and the Recompenser of merits, then He compels our submission to Him, in whose hands[fn-59-P5926_1787860:640-nf] He has placed a retribution which will be acceptable or terrible according as every man shall have judged or condemned, acquitted or dealt with,[fn-59-P5927_1788023:641-nf] his neighbour; if from (Marcion's god) himself, he will then exercise a judicial function which Marcion denies. Let the Marcionites therefore make their choice: Will it not be just the same inconsistency to desert the prescription of their master, as to have Christ teaching in the interest of men or of the Creator? But \"a blind man will lead a blind man into the ditch.\"[fn-59-P5928_1788418:642-nf] Some persons believe Marcion. But \"the disciple is not above his master.\"[fn-59-P5929_1788512:643-nf] Apelles ought to have remembered this-a corrector of Marcion, although his disciple.[fn-59-P5930_1788617:644-nf] The heretic ought to take the beam out of his own eye, and then he may convict[fn-59-P5931_1788717:645-nf] the Christian, should he suspect a mote to be in his eye. Just as a good tree cannot produce evil fruit, so neither can truth generate heresy; and as a corrupt tree cannot yield good fruit, so heresy will not produce truth. Thus, Marcion brought nothing good out of Cerdon's evil treasure; nor Apelles out of Marcion's.[fn-59-P5932_1789054:646-nf] For in applying to these heretics the figurative words which Christ used of men in general, we shall make a much more suitable interpretation of them than if we were to deduce out of them two gods, according to Marcion's grievous exposition.[fn-59-P5933_1789399:647-nf] I think that I have the best reason possible for insisting still upon the position which I have all along occupied, that in no passage to be anywhere found has another God been revealed by Christ. I wonder that in this place alone Marcion's hands should have felt benumbed in their adulterating labour.[fn-59-P5934_1789833:648-nf] But even robbers have their qualms now and then. There is no wrong-doing without fear, because there is none without a guilty conscience. So long, then, were the Jews cognisant of no other god but Him, beside whom they knew none else; nor did they call upon any other than Him whom alone they knew. This being the case, who will He clearly be[fn-59-P5935_1790364:649-nf] that said, \"Why callest thou me Lord, Lord? \"[fn-59-P5936_1790428:650-nf] Will it be he who had as yet never been called on, because never yet revealed;[fn-59-P5937_1790527:651-nf] or He who was ever regarded as the Lord, because known from the beginning-even the God of the Jews? Who, again, could possibly have added, \"and do not the things which I say? \"Could it have been he who was only then doing his best[fn-59-P5938_1790773:652-nf] to teach them? Or He who from the beginning had addressed to them His messages[fn-59-P5939_1790906:653-nf] both by the law and the prophets? He could then upbraid them with disobedience, even if He had no ground at any time else for His reproof. The fact is, that He who was then imputing to them their ancient obstinacy was none other than He who, before the coming of Christ, had addressed to them these words, \"This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart standeth far off from me.\"[fn-59-P5940_1791314:654-nf] Otherwise, how absurd it were that a new god, a new Christ, the revealer of a new and so grand a religion should denounce as obstinate and disobedient those whom he had never had it in his power to make trial of!","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":58,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":33,"source_paragraph":"112","folder":"ANF-03","text":"What kind of persons does He bid should be invited to a dinner or a supper?[fn-65-P6572_1932247:1243-nf] Precisely such as he had pointed out by Isaiah: \"Deal thy bread to the hungry man; and the beggars-even such as have no home-bring in to thine house,\"[fn-65-P6573_1932424:1244-nf] because, no doubt, they are \"unable to recompense\" your act of humanity. Now, since Christ forbids the recompense to be expected now, but promises it \"at the resurrection,\" this is the very plan[fn-65-P6574_1932643:1245-nf] of the Creator, who dislikes those who love gifts and follow after reward. Consider also to which deity[fn-65-P6575_1932763:1246-nf] is better suited the parable of him who issued invitations: \"A certain man made a great supper, and bade many.\"[fn-65-P6576_1932895:1247-nf] The preparation for the supper is no doubt a figure of the abundant provision[fn-65-P6577_1932996:1248-nf] of eternal life. I first remark, that strangers, and persons unconnected by ties of relationship, are not usually invited to a supper; but that members of the household and family are more frequently the favoured guests. To the Creator, then, it belonged to give the invitation, to whom also appertained those who were to be invited-whether considered as men, through their descent from Adam, or as Jews, by reason of their fathers; not to him who possessed no claim to them either by nature or prerogative. My next remark is,[fn-65-P6578_1933545:1249-nf] if He issues the invitations who has prepared the supper, then, in this sense the supper is the Creator's, who sent to warn the guests. These had been indeed previously invited by the fathers, but were to be admonished by the prophets. It certainly is not the feast of him who never sent a messenger to warn-who never did a thing before towards issuing an invitation, but came down himself on a sudden-only then[fn-65-P6579_1933974:1250-nf] beginning to be known, when already[fn-65-P6580_1934036:1251-nf] giving his invitation; only then inviting, when already compelling to his banquet; appointing one and the same hour both for the supper and the invitation. But when invited, they excuse themselves.[fn-65-P6581_1934260:1252-nf] And fairly enough, if the invitation came from the other god, because it was so sudden; if, however, the excuse was not a fair one, then the invitation was not a sudden one. Now, if the invitation was not a sudden one, it must have been given by the Creator-even by Him of old time, whose call they had at last refused. They first refused it when they said to Aaron, \"Make us gods, which shall go before us; \"[fn-65-P6582_1934693:1253-nf] and again, afterwards, when \"they heard indeed with the ear, but did not understand\"[fn-65-P6583_1934801:1254-nf] their calling of God. In a manner most germane[fn-65-P6584_1934870:1255-nf] to this parable, He said by Jeremiah: \"Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people; and ye shall walk in all my ways, which I have commanded you.\"[fn-65-P6585_1935064:1256-nf] This is the invitation of God. \"But,\" says He, \"they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear.\"[fn-65-P6586_1935180:1257-nf] This is the refusal of the people. \"They departed, and walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart.\"[fn-65-P6587_1935316:1258-nf] \"I have bought a field-and I have bought some oxen-and I have married a wife.\"[fn-65-P6588_1935416:1259-nf] And still He urges them: \"I have sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early even before day-light.\"[fn-65-P6589_1935556:1260-nf] The Holy Spirit is here meant, the admonisher of the guests. \"Yet my people hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck.\"[fn-65-P6590_1935768:1261-nf] This was reported to the Master of the family. Then He was moved (He did well to be moved; for, as Marcion denies emotion to his god, He must be therefore my God), and commanded them to invite out of \"the streets and lanes of the city.\"[fn-65-P6591_1936028:1262-nf] Let us see whether this is not the same in purport as His words by Jeremiah: \"Have I been a wilderness to the house of Israel, or a land left uncultivated? \"[fn-65-P6592_1936209:1263-nf] That is to say: \"Then have I none whom I may call to me; have I no place whence I may bring them? \"\"Since my people have said, We will come no more unto thee.\"[fn-65-P6593_1936391:1264-nf] Therefore He sent out to call others, but from the same city.[fn-65-P6594_1936475:1265-nf] My third remark is this,[fn-65-P6595_1936523:1266-nf] that although the place abounded with people, He yet commanded that they gather men from the highways and the hedges. In other words, we are now gathered out of the Gentile strangers; with that jealous resentment, no doubt, which He expressed in Deuteronomy: \"I will hide my face from them, and I will show them what shall happen in the last days[fn-65-P6596_1936888:1267-nf] (how that others shall possess their place); for they are a froward generation, children in whom is no faith. They have moved me to jealousy by that which is no god, and they have provoked me to anger with. their idols; and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people: I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation\"[fn-65-P6597_1937274:1268-nf] -even with us, whose hope the Jews still entertain.[fn-65-P6598_1937355:1269-nf] But this hope the Lord says they should not realize;[fn-65-P6599_1937521:1270-nf] \"Sion being left as a cottages[fn-66-P6600_1937573:1271-nf] in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers,\"[fn-66-P6601_1937685:1272-nf] since the nation rejected the latest invitation to Christ. (Now, I ask, ) after going through all this course of the Creator's dispensation and prophecies, what there is in it which can possibly be assigned to him who has done all his work at one hasty stroke,[fn-66-P6602_1937966:1273-nf] and possesses neither the Creator's[fn-66-P6603_1938018:1274-nf] course nor His dispensation in harmony with the parable? Or, again in what will consist his first invitation,[fn-66-P6604_1938413:1275-nf] and what his admonition[fn-66-P6605_1938475:1276-nf] at the second stage? Some at first would surely decline; others afterwards must have accepted.\"[fn-66-P6606_1938615:1277-nf] But now he comes to invite both parties promiscuously out of the city,[fn-66-P6607_1938802:1278-nf] out of the hedges,[fn-66-P6608_1938840:1279-nf] contrary to the drift[fn-66-P6609_1938885:1280-nf] of the parable. It is impossible for him now to condemn as scorners of his invitation[fn-66-P6610_1938990:1281-nf] those whom he has never yet invited, and whom he is approaching with so much earnestness. If, however, he condemns them beforehand as about to reject his call, then beforehand he also predicts[fn-66-P6611_1939205:1282-nf] the election of the Gentiles in their stead. Certainly[fn-66-P6612_1939280:1283-nf] he means to come the second time for the very purpose of preaching to the heathen. But even if he does mean to come again, I imagine it will not be with the intention of any longer inviting guests, but of giving to them their places. Meanwhile, you who interpret the call to this supper as an invitation to a heavenly banquet of spiritual satiety and pleasure, must remember that the earthly promises also of wine and oil and corn, and even of the city, are equally employed by the Creator as figures of spiritual things.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":58,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":39,"source_paragraph":"124","folder":"ANF-03","text":"\"Salvation comes to the house\" of Zacchµus even.[fn-68-P6826_1989404:1479-nf] For what reason?

And this circumstance would assist rather than hinder the understanding of Scripture, if only readers were not careless. For the examination of a number of texts has often thrown light upon some of the more obscure passages; for example, in that passage of the prophet Isaiah,[fn-48-P4872_2636056:17-nf] one translator reads: \"And do not despise the domestics of thy seed;\"[fn-48-P4873_2636209:18-nf] another reads: \"And do not despise thine own flesh.\"[fn-48-P4874_2636308:19-nf] Each of these in turn confirms the other. For the one is explained by the other; because \"flesh\" may be taken in its literal sense, so that a man may understand that he is admonished not to despise his own body; and \"the domestics of thy seed\" may be understood figuratively of Christians, because they are spiritually born of the same seed as ourselves, namely, the Word. When now the meaning of the two translators is compared, a more likely sense of the words suggests itself, viz., that the command is not to despise our kinsmen, because when one brings the expression \"domestics of thy seed\" into relation with \"flesh,\" kinsmen most naturally occur to one's mind. Whence, I think, that expression of the apostle, when he says, \"If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them;\"[fn-48-P4875_2637175:20-nf] that is, that through emulation of those who had believed, some of them might believe too. And he calls the Jews his \"flesh,\" on account of the relationship of blood. Again, that passage from the same prophet Isaiah:[fn-48-P4876_2637410:21-nf] \"If ye will not believe, ye shall not understand,\"[fn-48-P4877_2637550:22-nf] another has translated: \"If ye will not believe, ye shall not abide.\"[fn-48-P4878_2637663:23-nf] Now which of these is the literal translation cannot be ascertained without reference to the text in the original tongue. And yet to those who read with knowledge, a great truth is to be found in each. For it is difficult for interpreters to differ so widely as not to touch at some point. Accordingly here, as understanding consists in sight, and is abiding, but faith feeds us as babes, upon milk, in the cradles of temporal things (for now we walk by faith, not by sight);[fn-48-P4879_2638182:24-nf] as, moreover, unless we walk by faith, we shall not attain to sight, which does not pass away, but abides, our understanding being purified by holding to the truth;-for these reasons one says,\" If ye will not believe, ye shall not understand;\" but the other, \"If ye will not believe, ye shall not abide.\"","title":"Book II","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":58,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"305","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In Isaiah: \"Cry aloud,\" saith He, \"and spare not; lift up thy voice like a trumpet; tell my people their sins, and the house of Jacob their wickednesses.

For in the days of fasting are found your own wills; for either ye torment those who are subjected to you, or ye fast for strifes and judgments, or ye strike your neighbours with fists.

Even as thou hast, my son, so do: if thou hast abundant substance, give the more alms therefrom; if thou hast little, communicate even of that little. And do not fear when thou givest alms: thou layest up for thyself a good reward against the day of need; because alms delivereth from death, and does not suffer to go into darkness.

Again, because it has happened that the heretics[fn-36-P3650_1595248:43-nf] in some places have suffered the penalty of the laws for the impiety and fury of their deeds of violence; they say immediately that we are seeking by every means some harm for their destruction. Again, because it has been resolved that laws should be passed against the Heathen, yea for them rather, if they were only wise. (For as when silly boys are playing with the mud, and dirtying their hands, the strict master comes, shakes the mud out of their hands, and holds out their book; so has it pleased God by the hands of princes His subjects to alarm their childish, foolish hearts, that they may throw away the dirt from their hands, and set about something useful. And what is this something usefulwith the hands, but, \"Break thy bread to the hungry, and bring the houseless poor into thy house\"?[fn-36-P3651_1596688:44-nf] But nevertheless these children escapefrom their master's sight, and return stealthily to their mud, and when they are discovered they hide their hands that they may not be seen.) Because then it has so pleased God, they think that we are looking out for the idols everywhere, and that we break them down in all places where we have discovered them. How so? Are there not places before our very eyes in which they are? Or are we indeed ignorant where they are? And yet we do not break them down, because God has not given them into our power. When does God give them into our power? When the masters of these things shall become Christians. The master of a certain place has just lately wished this to be done. If he had not been minded to give the place itself to the Church, and only had given orders that thereshould be no idols on his property; I think that it ought to have been executed with the greatestdevotion, that the soul of the absent Christian brother, who wishes on his land to return thanks to God, and would not that there should be anything there to God's dishonour, might be assisted by his fellow-Christians. Added to this, that in this case he gave the place itself to the Church. And shall there be idols n the Church's estate? Brethren, see then what it is that displeases the Heathens. It is but a little matter with them that we do not take them away from their estates, that we do not break them down: they would have them kept up even in our own places. We preach against idols, we take them away from the hearts of men; we are persecutors of idols; we openly profess it. Are we then to be the preservers of them?

Then, those who have put faith in necromancers, receive from them amulets and charms, to ward off evil forsooth; and will you not allow the heavenly Word, the Saviour, to be bound on to you as an amulet, and, by trusting in God's own charm, be delivered from passions which are the diseases of the mind, and rescued from sin?-for sin is eternal death. Surely utterly dull and blind, and, like moles, doing nothing but eat, you spend your lives in darkness, surrounded with corruption. But it is truth which cries, \"The light shall shine forth from the darkness.\" Let the light then shine in the hidden part of man, that is, the heart; and let the beams of knowledge arise to reveal and irradiate the hidden inner man, the disciple of the Light, the familiar friend and fellow-heir of Christ; especially now that we have come to know the most precious and venerable name of the good Father, who to a pious and good child gives gentle counsels, and commands what is salutary for His child. He who obeys Him has the advantage in all things, follows God, obeys the Father, knows Him through wandering, loves God, loves his neighbour, fulfils the commandment, seeks the prize, claims the promise. But it has been God's fixed and constant purpose to save the flock of men: for this end the good God sent the good Shepherd. And the Word, having unfolded the truth, showed to men the height of salvation, that either repenting they might be saved, or refusing to obey, they might be judged. This is the proclamation of righteousness: to those that obey, glad tidings; to those that disobey, judgment. The loud trumpet, when sounded, collects the soldiers, and proclaims war. And shall not Christ, breathing a strain of peace to the ends of the earth, gather together His own soldiers, the soldiers of peace? Well, by His blood, and by the word, He has gathered the bloodless host of peace, and assigned to them the kingdom of heaven. The trumpet of Christ is His Gospel. He hath blown it, and we have heard. \"Let us array ourselves in the armour of peace, putting on the breastplate of righteousness, and taking the shield of faith, and binding our brows with the helmet, of salvation; and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God,\"[fn-32-P3245_963782:166-nf] let us sharpen. So the apostle in the spirit of peace commands. These are our invulnerable weapons: armed with these, let us face the evil one; \"the fiery darts of the evil one\" let us quench with the sword-points dipped in water, that, have been baptized by the Word, returning grateful thanks for the benefits we have received, and honouring God through the Divine Word. \"For while thou art yet speaking,\" it is said, \"He will say, Behold, I am beside thee.\"[fn-32-P3246_964266:167-nf] O this holy and blessed power, by which God has fellowship with men! Better far, then, is it to become at once the imitator and the servant of the best of all beings; for only by holy service will any one be able to imitate God, and to serve and worship Him only by imitating Him. The heavenly and truly divine love comes to men thus, when in the soul itself the spark of true goodness, kindled in the soul by the Divine Word, is able to burst forth into flame; and, what is of the highest importance, salvation runs parallel with sincere willingness-choice and life being, so to speak, yoked together. Wherefore this exhortation of the truth alone, like the most faithful of our friends, abides with us till our last breath, and is to the whole and perfect spirit of the soul the kind attendant on our ascent to heaven. What, then, is the exhortation I give you? I urge you to be saved. This Christ desires. In one word. He freely bestows life on you. And who is He? Briefly learn. The Word of truth, the Word of incorruption, that regenerates man by bringing him back to the truth-the goad that urges to salvation t He who expels destruction and pursues death-He who builds up the temple of God in men, that He may cause God to take up His abode in men. Cleanse the temple; and pleasures and amusements abandon to the winds and the fire, as a fading flower; but wisely cultivate the fruits of self-command, and present thyself to God as an offering of first-fruits, that there may be not the work alone, but also the grace of God; and both are requisite, that the friend of Christ may be rendered worthy of the kingdom, and be counted worthy of the kingdom.

I do not mention Apollinarius, who, with a laudable zeal though not according to knowledge, attempted to patch up into one garment the rags of all the translations, and to weave a consistent text of Scripture at his own discretion, not according to any sound rule of criticism. The Hebrew Scriptures are used by apostolic men; they are used, as is evident, by the apostles and evangelists. Our Lord and Saviour himself whenever he refers to the Scriptures, takes his quotations from the Hebrew; as in the instance of the words[fn-93-P9367_2564319:65-nf] \"He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water,\" and in the words used on the cross itself, \"Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani,\" which is by interpretation \"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\" not, as it is given by the Septuagint, \"My God, my God, look upon me, why hast thou forsaken me?\" and many similar cases. I do not say this in order to aim a blow at the seventy translators; but I assert that the Apostles of Christ bare an authority superior to theirs. Wherever the Seventy agree with the Hebrew, the apostles took their quotations from that translation; but, where they disagree, they set down in Greek what they had found in the Hebrew. And further, I give a challenge to my accuser. I have shown that many things are set down in the New Testament as coming from the older books, which are not to be found in the Septuagint; and I have pointed out that these exist in the Hebrew.

And the treasures of wisdom are unfailing, in admiration of which the apostle says, \"O the depth of the riches and the wisdom!\"[fn-46-P4613_1418059:175-nf] And by one God are many treasures dispensed; some disclosed by the law, others by the prophets; some to the divine mouth, and others to the heptad of the spirit singing accordant. And the Lord being one, is the same Instructor by all these. Here is then a comprehensive precept, and an exhortation of life, all-embracing: \"As ye would that men should do unto you, do ye likewise to, them.\"[fn-46-P4614_1418469:176-nf] We may comprehend the commandments in two, as the Lord says, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy strength; and thy neighbour as thyself.\" Then from these He infers, \"on this hang the law and the prophets.\"[fn-46-P4615_1418749:177-nf] Further, to him that asked, \"What good thing shall I do, that I may inherit eternal life? \"He answered, \"Thou knowest the commandments? \"And on him replying Yea, He said, \"This do, and thou shalt be saved.\" Especially conspicuous is the love of the Instructor set forth in various salutary commandments, in order that the discovery may be readier, from the abundance and arrangement of the Scriptures. We have the Decalogue[fn-46-P4616_1419204:178-nf] given by Moses, which, indicating by an elementary principle, simple and of one kind, defines the designation of sins in a way conducive to salvation: \"Thou shall not commit adultery. Thou shall not worship idols. Thou shalt not corrupt boys. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shall not bear false witness. Honour thy father and thy mother.\"[fn-46-P4617_1419570:179-nf] And so forth. These things are to be observed, and whatever else is commanded in reading the Bible. And He enjoins on us by Isaiah: \"Wash you, and make you clean.

And come, and let us reason together, saith the Lord.\"[fn-46-P4618_1419966:180-nf] And we shall find many examples also in other places,-as, for instance, respecting prayer: \"Good works are an acceptable prayer to the Lord,\" says the Scripture.[fn-46-P4619_1420155:181-nf] And the manner of prayer is described. \"If thou seest,\" it is said, \"the naked, cover him; and thou shalt not overlook those who belong to thy seed.

Since, then, they define manliness to be knowledge[fn-59-P5927_1796372:190-nf] of things formidable, and not formidable, and what is intermediate; and temperance to be a state of mind which by choosing and avoiding preserves the judgments of wisdom; and conjoined with manliness is patience, which is called endurance, the knowledge of what is bearable and what is unbearable; and magnanimity is the knowledge which rises superior to circumstances. With temperance also is conjoined caution, which is avoidance in accordance with reason. And observance of the commandments, which is the innoxious keeping of them, is the attainment of a secure life. And there is no endurance without manliness, nor the exercise of self-restraint without temperance. And these virtues follow one another; and with whom are the sequences of the virtues, with him is also salvation, which is the keeping of the state of well-being. Rightly, therefore, in treating of these virtues, we shall inquire into them all; for he that has one virtue gnostically, by reason of their accompanying each other, has them all. Self-restraint is that quality which does not overstep what appears in accordance with right reason. He exercises self-restraint, who curbs the impulses that are contrary to right reason, or curbs himself so as not to indulge in desires contrary to right reason. Temperance, too, is not without manliness; since from the commandments spring both wisdom, which follows God who enjoins, and that which imitates the divine character, namely righteousness; in virtue of which, in the exercise of self-restraint, we address ourselves in purity to piety and the course of conduct thence resulting, in conformity with God; being assimilated to the Lord as far as is possible for us beings mortal in nature. And this is being just and holy with wisdom; for the Divinity needs nothing and suffers nothing; whence it is not, strictly speaking, capable of self-restraint, for it is never subjected to perturbation, over which to exercise control; while our nature, being capable of perturbation, needs self-constraint, by which disciplining itself to the need of little, it endeavours to approximate in character to the divine nature. For the good man, standing as the boundary between an immortal and a mortal nature, has few needs; having wants in consequence of his body, and his birth itself, but taught by rational self-control to want few things.","title":"Book II.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":58,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_62_book_iv_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"129","folder":"ANF-01","text":"2. For it was not because He was angry, like a man, as many venture to say, that He rejected their sacrifices; but out of compassion to their blindness, and with the view of suggesting to them the true sacrifice, by offering which they shall appease God, that they may receive life from Him. As He elsewhere declares: \"The sacrifice to God is an afflicted heart: a sweet savour to God is a heart glorifying Him who formed it.\"[fn-83-P8301_2311118:218-nf] For if, when angry, He had repudiated these sacrifices of theirs, as if they were persons unworthy to obtain His compassion, He would not certainly have urged these same things upon them as those by which they might be saved. But inasmuch as God is merciful, He did not cut them off from good counsel. For after He had said by Jeremiah, \"To what purpose bring ye Me incense from Saba, and cinnamon from a far country? Your whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices are not acceptable to Me; \"[fn-83-P8302_2312032:219-nf] He proceeds: \"Hear the word of the Lord, all Judah.

And again, when He points out that it was not for this that He led them out of Egypt, that they might offer sacrifice to Him, but that, forgetting the idolatry of the Egyptians, they should be able to hear the voice of the Lord, which was to them salvation and glory, He declares by this same Jeremiah: \"Thus saith the Lord; Collect together your burnt-offerings with your sacrifices and eat flesh. For I spake not unto your fathers nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of Egypt, concerning burnt-offerings or sacrifices: but this word I commanded them, saying, Hear My voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be My people; and walk in all My ways whatsoever I have commanded you, that it may be well with you. But they obeyed not, nor hearkened; but walked in the imaginations of their own evil heart, and went backwards, and not forwards.\"[fn-83-P8304_2313265:221-nf] And again, when He declares by the same man, \"But let him that glorieth, glory in this, to understand and know that I am the Lord, who doth exercise loving-kindness, and righteousness, and judgment in the earth; \"[fn-83-P8305_2313500:222-nf] He adds, \"For in these things I delight, says the Lord,\" but not in sacrifices, nor in holocausts, nor in oblations. For the people did not receive these precepts as of primary importance (principaliter), but as secondary, and for the reason already alleged, as Isaiah again says: \"Thou hast not [brought to] Me the sheep of thy holocaust, nor in thy sacrifices hast thou glorified Me: thou hast not served Me in sacrifices, nor in [the matter of] frankincense hast thou done anything laboriously; neither hast thou bought for Me incense with money, nor have I desired the fat of thy sacrifices; but thou hast stood before Me in thy sins and in thine iniquities.\"[fn-83-P8306_2314184:223-nf] He says, therefore, \"Upon this man will I look, even upon him that is humble, and meek, and who trembles at My words.\"[fn-83-P8307_2314330:224-nf] \"For the fat and the fat flesh shall not take away from thee thine unrighteousness.\"[fn-83-P8308_2314436:225-nf] \"This is the fast which I have chosen, saith the Lord.

If thou hast seen the naked, cover him, and thou shalt not despise those of thine own flesh and blood (domesticos seminis tui).

And oppress not the widow, and the orphan, and the proselyte, and the poor; and let none imagine evil against your brother in his heart.\"[fn-83-P8310_2315507:227-nf] And again, he says: \"These are the words which ye shall utter.

Shun evil, and do good: seek peace, and pursue it.\"[fn-83-P8312_2316102:229-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":58,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_63_book_v_","source_chapter":36,"source_paragraph":"177","folder":"ANF-01","text":"2.

For when we were anxious by some means or other to procure the latter part of this same letter, because those from whom we obtained it were unable to describe the whole of it, no one who was asked for it was willing to give it to us, so soon as they knew that we were making a reply to the portion which we had.

For you have the fruits of an answer pointed out by our Lord's words in the case of the agreement of two persons; as it is said: \"If two of you shall agree upon earth touching anything for which they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.\"[fn-49-P4971_1790561:49-nf] You have another in the fulness of faith, which is compared to a grain of mustard-seed. \"For,\" He says, \"if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain: Be thou removed, and it shall be removed; and nothing shall be impossible to you.\"[fn-49-P4972_1790850:50-nf] You have it in continuance in prayer, which the Lord's words call, by reason of unwearied perseverance in petitioning, importunity: \"For, verily, I say unto you that if not because of his friendship, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as much as he needs.\"[fn-49-P4973_1791154:51-nf] You have it in the fruits of almsgiving: \"Shut up alms in the heart of the poor and it shall pray for thee in the time of tribulation.\"[fn-49-P4974_1791316:52-nf] You have it in the purifying of life and in works of mercy, as it is said: \"Loose the bands of wickedness, undo the bundles that oppress;\" and after a few words in which the barrenness of an unfruitful fast is rebuked, \"then,\" he says, \"thou shall call and the Lord shall hear thee; thou shalt cry, and He shall say, Here am I.\"[fn-49-P4975_1791669:53-nf] Sometimes also excess of trouble causes it to be heard, as it is said: \"When I was in trouble I called unto the Lord, and He heard me;\"[fn-49-P4976_1791838:54-nf] and again: \"Afflict not the stranger for if he crieth unto Me, I will hear him, for I am merciful.\"[fn-49-P4977_1791961:55-nf] You see then in how many ways the gift of an answer may be obtained, so that no one need be crushed by the despair of his conscience for securing those things which are salutary and eternal. For if in contemplating our wretchedness I admit that we are utterly destitute of all those virtues which we mentioned above, and that we have neither that laudable agreement of two persons, nor that faith which is compared to a grain of mustard seed, nor those works of piety which the prophet describes, surely we cannot be without that importunity which He supplies to all who desire it, owing to which alone the Lord promises that He will give whatever He has been prayed to give. And therefore we ought without unbelieving hesitation to persevere, and not to have the least doubt that by continuing in them we shall obtain all those things which we have asked according to the mind of God. For the Lord, in His desire to grant what is heavenly and eternal, urges us to constrain Him as it were by our importunity, as He not only does not despise or reject the importunate, but actually welcomes and praises them, and most graciously promises to grant whatever they have perseveringly hoped for; saying, \"Ask and ye shall receive: seek and ye shall find: knock and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it shall be opened;\"[fn-49-P4978_1793384:56-nf] and again: \"All things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive, and nothing shall be impossible to you.\"[fn-49-P4979_1793529:57-nf] And therefore even if all the grounds for being heard which we have mentioned are altogether wanting, at any rate the earnestness of importunity may animate us, as this is placed in the power of any one who wills without the difficulties of any merits or labours. But let not any suppliant doubt that he certainly will not be heard, so long as he doubts whether he is heard. But that this also shall be sought from the Lord unweariedly, we are taught by the example of the blessed Daniel, as, though he was heard from the first day on which he began to pray, he only obtained the result of his petition after one and twenty days.[fn-49-P4980_1794179:58-nf] Wherefore we also ought not to grow slack in the earnestness of the prayers we have begun, if we fancy that the answer comes but slowly, for fear lest perhaps the gift of the answer be in God's providence delayed, or the angel, who was to bring the Divine blessing to us, may when he comes forth from the Presence of the Almighty be hindered by the resistance of the devil, as it is certain that he cannot transmit and bring to us the desired boon, if he finds that we slack off from the earnestness of the petition made. And this would certainly have happened to the above mentioned prophet unless he had with incomparable steadfastness prolonged and persevered in his prayers until the twenty-first day. Let us then not be at all cast down by despair from the confidence of this faith of ours, even when we fancy that we are far from having obtained what we prayed for, and let us not have any doubts about the Lord's promise where He says: \"All things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing, ye shall receive.\"[fn-49-P4981_1795222:59-nf] For it is well for us to consider this saying of the blessed Evangelist John, by which the ambiguity of this question is clearly solved: \"This is,\" he says, \"the confidence which we have in Him, that whatsoever we ask according to His will, He heareth us.\"[fn-49-P4982_1795789:60-nf] He bids us then have a full and undoubting confidence of the answer only in those things which are not for our own advantage or for temporal comforts, but are in conformity to the Lord's will. And we are also taught to put this into our prayers by the Lord's Prayer, where we say \"Thy will be done,\"-Thine not ours. For if we also remember these words of the Apostle that \"we know not what to pray for as we ought\"[fn-49-P4983_1796228:61-nf] we shall see that we sometimes ask for things opposed to our salvation and that we are most providentially refused our requests by Him who sees what is good for us with greater right and truth than we can. And it is clear that this also happened to the teacher of the Gentiles when he prayed that the messenger of Satan who had been for his good allowed by the Lord's will to buffet him, might be removed, saying: \"For which I besought the Lord thrice that he might depart from me. And He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee, for strength is made perfect in weakness.\"[fn-49-P4984_1796840:62-nf] And this feeling even our Lord expressed when He prayed in the character[fn-49-P4985_1796933:63-nf] of man which He had taken, that He might give us a form of prayer as other things also by His example; saying thus: \"Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt,\"[fn-49-P4986_1797176:64-nf] though certainly His will was not discordant with His Father's will, \"For He had come to save what was lost and to give His life a ransom for many;\"[fn-49-P4987_1797346:65-nf] as He Himself says: \"No man taketh my life from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again.\"[fn-49-P4988_1797507:66-nf] In which character there is in the thirty-ninth Psalm the following sung by the blessed David, of the Unity of will which He ever maintained with the Father: \"To do Thy will: O My God, I am willing.\"[fn-49-P4989_1797727:67-nf] For even if we read of the Father: \"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son,\"[fn-49-P4990_1797852:68-nf] we find none the less of the Son: \"Who gave Himself for our sins.\"[fn-49-P4991_1797935:69-nf] And as it is said of the One: \"Who spared not His own Son, but gave Him for all of us,\"[fn-49-P4992_1798044:70-nf] so it is written of the other: \"He was offered because He Himself willed it.\"[fn-49-P4993_1798146:71-nf] And it is shown that the will of the Father and of the Son is in all things one, so that even in the actual mystery of the Lord's resurrection we are taught that there was no discord of operation. For just as the blessed Apostle declares that the Father brought about the resurrection of His body, saying: \"And God the Father, who raised Him from the dead,\"[fn-49-P4994_1798569:72-nf] so also the Son testifies that He Himself will raise again the Temple of His body, saying: \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again.\"[fn-49-P4995_1798808:73-nf] And therefore we being instructed by all these examples of our Lord which have been enumerated ought to end our supplications also with the same prayer, and always to subjoin this clause to all our petitions: \"Nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt.\"[fn-49-P4996_1799084:74-nf] But it is clear enough that one who does not[fn-49-P4997_1799204:75-nf] pray with attention of mind cannot observe that threefold reverence[fn-49-P4998_1800699:76-nf] which is usually practised in the assemblies of the brethren at the close of service.","title":"IX.

How, then, do we find the two precepts of love indicated in these two commands of the Lord? \"Take up thy bed,\" saith He, \"and walk.\" What the two precepts are, my brethren, recollect with me. For they ought to be thoroughly familiar to you, and not merely to come into your mind when they are recited by us, but they ought never to be blotted out from your hearts. Let it ever be your supreme thought, that you must love God and your neighbor: \"God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and With all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.\" These must always be pondered, meditated, retained, practised, and fulfilled. The love of God comes first in the order of enjoying; but in the order of doing, the love of our neighbor comes first. For He who commanded thee this love in two precepts did not charge thee to love thy neighbor first, and then God, but first God, afterwards thy neighbor. Thou however, as thou dost not yet see God dost earn to see Him by loving thy neighbor; by loving thy neighbor thou purgest thine eye for seeing God, as John evidently says, \"If thou lovest not thy brother whom thou seest, how canst thou love God, whom thou dost not see?\"[fn-9-P947_532078:12-nf] See, thou art told, \"Love God.\" If thou say to me, \"Show me Him, that I may love Him;\" what shall I answer, but what the same John saith: \"No man hath seen God at any time\"? And, that you may not suppose yourself to be wholly estranged from seeing God, he saith, \"God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God.\"[fn-9-P948_532422:13-nf] Therefore love thy neighbor; look at the source of thy love of thy neighbor; there thou wilt see, as thou mayest, God. Begin, then, to love thy neighbor. \"Break thy bread to the hungry, and bring into thy house him that is needy without shelter; if thou seest the naked, clothe him; and despise not those of the household of thy seed.\" And in doing this, what wilt thou get in consequence? \"Then shall thy light break forth as the morning light.\"[fn-9-P949_532889:14-nf] Thy light is thy God, a \"morning light\" to thee, because He shall come to thee after the night of this world: for He neither rises nor sets, because He is ever abiding. He will be a morning light to thee on thy return, He who had set for thee on thy falling away from Him. Therefore, in this \"Take up thy bed,\" He seems to me to have said, Love thy neighbor.","title":"Tractate XVII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":58,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_64_xiv_the_first_conference_of_abbot_nesteros_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"61","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Nesteros: From this very fact, from which there springs up for you the utmost despair of your purification, a speedy and effectual remedy may arise if only you will transfer to the reading of and meditation upon the writings of the Spirit, the same diligence and earnestness which you say that you showed in those secular studies of yours. For your mind is sure to be taken up with those poems until it is gaining with the same zeal and assiduity other matters for it to reflect upon, and is in labour with spiritual and divine things instead of unprofitable earthly ones. But when these are thoroughly and entirely conceived and it has been nourished upon them, then by degrees the former thoughts can be expelled and utterly got rid of. For the mind of man cannot be emptied of all thoughts, and so as long as it is not taken up with spiritual interests, is sure to be occupied with what it learnt long since. For as long as it has nothing to recur to and exercise itself upon unweariedly, it is sure to fall back upon what it learnt in childhood, and ever to think about what it took in by long use and meditation. In order then that this spiritual knowledge may be strengthened in you with a lasting steadfastness, and that you may not enjoy it only for a time like those who just touch it not by their own exertions but at the recital of another, and if I may use the expression, perceive its scent in the air; but that it may be laid up in your heart, and deeply noted in it, and thoroughly seen and handled, it is well for you to use the utmost care in securing that, even if perhaps you hear things that you know very well produced in the Conference, you do not regard them in a scornful and disdainful way because you already know them, but that you lay them to your heart with the same eagerness, with which the words of salvation which we are longing for ought to be constantly poured into our ears or should ever proceed from our lips. For although the narration of holy things be often repeated, yet in a mind that feels a thirst for true knowledge the satiety will never create disgust, but as it receives it every day as if it were something new and what it wanted however often it may have taken it in, it will so much the more eagerly either hear or speak, and from the repetition of these things will gain confirmation of the knowledge it already possesses, rather than weariness of any sort from the frequent Conference. For it is a sure sign of a mind that is cold and proud, if it receives with disdain and carelessness the medicine of the words of salvation, although it be offered with the zeal of excessive persistence. For \"a soul that is full jeers at honeycomb: but to a soul that is in want even little things appear sweet.\"[fn-55-P5530_1982598:40-nf] And so if these things have been carefully taken in and stored up in the recesses of the soul and stamped with the seal of silence, afterwards like some sweet scented wine that maketh glad the heart of man, they will, when mellowed by the antiquity of the thoughts and by long-standing patience, be brought forth from the jar of your heart with great fragrance, and like some perennial fountain will flow abundantly from the veins of experience and irrigating channels of virtue and will pour forth copious streams as if from some deep well in your heart. For that will happen in your case, which is spoken in Proverbs to one who has achieved this in his work: \"Drink waters from your own cisterns and from the fount of your own wells. Let waters from your own fountain flow in abundance for you, but let your waters pass through into your streets.\"[fn-55-P5531_1983469:41-nf] And according to the prophet Isaiah: \"Thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a fountain of water whose waters shall not fail. And the places that have been desolate for ages shall be built in thee; thou shalt raise up the foundations of generation and generation; and thou shalt be called the repairer of the fences, turning the paths into rest.\"[fn-55-P5532_1983845:42-nf] And that blessedness shall come upon thee which the same prophet promises: \"And the Lord will not cause thy teacher to flee away from thee any more, and thine eyes shall see thy teacher. And thine ears shall hear the word of one admonishing thee behind thy back: This is the way, walk ye in it, and go not aside either to the right hand or to the left.'[fn-55-P5533_1984223:43-nf] And so it will come to pass that not only every purpose and thought of your heart, but also all the wanderings and rovings of your imagination will become to you a holy and unceasing pondering of the Divine law.","title":"XIV.

And since it is no small matter to find a man who is perfect in either of them, it is clear how much harder and I had almost said impossible it is for a man to be thoroughly efficient in both. And if this has ever happened, it cannot come under any general rule. For a general rule must be based not on exceptional instances, i.e., on the experience of a very few, but on what is within the power of the many or rather of all. But what is attained to here and there by but one or two, and is beyond the capacity of ordinary goodness, must be kept out of general rules as something permitted outside the condition and nature of human weakness, and should be brought forward as a miracle rather than as an example. Wherefore I will, as my slender ability allows, briefly intimate what you want to know. The aim indeed of the coenobite is to mortify and crucify all his desires and, according to that salutary command of evangelic perfection, to take no thought for the morrow. And it is perfectly clear that this perfection cannot be attained by any except a coenobite, such a man as the prophet Isaiah describes and blesses and praises as follows: \"If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy own will in my holy day, and glorify Him, while thou dost not thine own ways, and thine own will is not found to speak a word: then shalt thou be delighted in the Lord, and I will lift thee up above the high places of the earth, and will feed thee with the inheritance of Jacob thy father. For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.\"[fn-61-P6168_2202208:8-nf] But the perfection for a hermit is to have his mind freed from all earthly things, and to unite it, as far as human frailty allows, with Christ: and such a man the prophet Jeremiah describes when he says: \"Blessed is the man who hath borne the yoke from his youth. He shall sit solitary and hold his peace, because he hath taken it upon himself;\" the Psalmist also: \"I am become like a pelican in the desert. I watched and became as a sparrow alone upon the housetop.\"[fn-61-P6169_2202700:9-nf] To this aim then, which we have described as that of either life, unless each of them attains, in vain does the one adopt the system of the coenobium, and the other of the hermitage: for neither of them will get the good of his method of life.","title":"XIX.

But in the case of a thing that is good in its own nature, no time should be without it, in such a way as that a man may do without it, for if it ceases, the man who is careless about it is sure to fall into mischief. Nor again is any time given for what is bad in its own nature, because what is hurtful cannot help hurting, if it is indulged in, nor can it ever be made of a praiseworthy character. And further it is clear that these things, for which we see conditions and times appointed, and which sanctify, when observed without corrupting us when they are neglected, are things indifferent, as, e.g., marriage, agriculture, riches, retirement into the desert, vigils, reading and meditation on Holy Scripture and fasting itself, from which our discussion took its rise. All of which things the Divine precepts and the authority of Holy Scripture decreed should not be so incessantly aimed at, or so constantly observed, as for it to be wrong for them to be for a time intermitted. For anything that is absolutely commanded brings death if it be not fulfilled: but whatever things we are urged to rather than commanded, when done are useful, when left undone bring no punishment. And therefore in the case of all or some of these things our predecessors commanded us either to do them with consideration, or to observe them carefully with regard to the reason, place, manner, and time, because if any of them are done suitably, it is fit and convenient, but if incongruously, then it becomes foolish and hurtful. And if at the coming of a brother in whose person he ought to refresh Christ with courtesy and to embrace him with a most kindly welcome, a man should choose to observe a strict fast, would he not rather be guilty of incivility than gain the praise or reward of devoutness? or if when the failure or weakness of the flesh requires the strength to be restored by the partaking of food, a man will not consent to relax the rigour of his abstinence, is he not to be regarded as a cruel murderer of his own body rather than as one who is careful for his salvation? So too when a festival season permits a suitable indulgence in food and a necessarily liberal repast, if a man will resolutely cling to the strict observance of a fast he must be considered as not religious so much as boorish and unreasonable. But to those men also will these things be found bad, who are on the lookout for the praises of men by their fasts, and by a foolish show of paleness gain credit for sanctity, of whom the word of the Gospel tells us that they have received their reward in this life, and whose fast the Lord execrates by the prophet. In whose person he first objected to himself and said: \"Wherefore have we fasted and Thou hast not regarded: wherefore have we humbled our souls, and Thou hast not known it?\" and then at once he answered and explained the reasons why they did not deserve to be heard: \"Behold,\" he says, \"in the days of your fast your own will is found and you exact of all your debtors. Behold you fast for debates and strife, and strike with the fist wickedly. Do not fast as ye have done unto this day, to make your cry to be heard on high. Is this such a fast as I have chosen, for a man to afflict his soul for a day? Is it this, to wind his head about like a circle, and to spread sackcloth and ashes? Will ye call this a fast and a day acceptable o the Lord?\" Then he proceeds to teach how the abstinence of one who fasts may become acceptable, and clearly lays down that faring cannot be good of itself alone, but only when it has the following reasons which are added: \"Is not this,\" he says, \"the fast that I have chosen? Loose the bands of wickedness, undo the bundles that oppress, let them that are broken go free, and break asunder every burden. Deal thy bread to the hungry, and bring the needy and the harbourless into thine house: and when thou shalt see one naked cover him, and despise not thine own flesh. Then shalt thy light break forth as the morning and thy health shall speedily arise, and thy righteousness shall go before thy face and the glory of the Lord shall gather thee up. Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall hear: thou shalt cry, and He shall say, Here am I.\"[fn-63-P6379_2281627:33-nf] You see then that fasting is certainly not considered by the Lord as a thing that is good in its own nature, because it becomes good and well-pleasing to God not by itself but by other works, and again from the surrounding circumstances it may be regarded as not merely vain but actually hateful, as the Lord says: \"When they fast I will not hear their prayers.\"[fn-63-P6380_2282012:34-nf] ","title":"XXI.

Now the Son is all this, who says, `I am the Life[fn-54-P5423_2127145:123-nf] ,' and, `I Wisdom dwell with prudence[fn-54-P5424_2127203:124-nf] .' Is it not then irreligious to say, `Once the Son was not?' for it is all one with saying, `Once the Fountain was dry, destitute of Life and Wisdom.' But a fountain it would then cease to be; for what begetteth not from itself, is not a fountain[fn-54-P5425_2127474:125-nf] . What a load of extravagance! for God promises that those who do His will shall be as a fountain which the water fails not, saying by Isaiah the prophet, `And the Lord shall satisfy thy soul in drought, and make thy bones fat; and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not[fn-54-P5426_2127811:126-nf] .'

But their doctrine is false; truth witnessing that God is the eternal Fountain of His proper Wisdom; and, if the Fountain be eternal, the Wisdom also must needs be eternal. For in It were all things made, as David says in the Psalm, `In Wisdom bast Thou made them all[fn-54-P5427_2128231:127-nf] ;' and Solomon says, `The Lord by Wisdom hath formed the earth, by understanding hath He established the heavens[fn-54-P5428_2128364:128-nf] .' And this Wisdom is the Word, and by Him, as John says, `all things were made,' and `without Him was made not one thing[fn-54-P5429_2128508:129-nf] .' And this Word is Christ; for `there is One God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we for Him; and One Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through Him[fn-54-P5430_2128754:130-nf] .' And if all things are through Him, He Himself is not to be reckoned with that `all' For he who dares[fn-54-P5431_2128881:131-nf] to call Him, through whom are things, one of that `all,' surely will have like speculations concerning God, from whom are all. But if he shrinks from this as unseemly, and excludes God from that all, it is but consistent that he should also exclude from that all the Only-Begotten Son, as being proper to the Father's essence. And, if He be not one of the all[fn-54-P5432_2129281:132-nf] , it is sin to say concerning Him, `He was not,' and `He was not before His generation.' Such words may be used of the creatures; but as to the Son, He is such as the Father is, of whose essence He is proper Offspring, Word, and Wisdom[fn-54-P5433_2129538:133-nf] . For this is proper to the Son, as regards the Father, and this shews that the Father is proper to the Son; that we may neither say that God was ever without Word[fn-54-P5434_2129723:134-nf] , nor that the Son was non-existent.

But if they refer these passages to the Father, will they, when it is here also written, `Become' and `He became,' venture so far as to affirm that God is originate? Yea, they will dare, as they thus argue concerning His Word; for the course of their argument carries them on to conjecture the same things concerning the Father, as they devise concerning His Word. But far be such a notion ever from the thoughts of all the faithful! for neither is the Son in the number of things originated, nor do the words of Scripture in question, `Become,' and `He became,' denote beginning of being, but that succour which was given to the needy. For God is always, and one and the same; but men have come to be afterwards through the Word, when the Father Himself willed it; and God is invisible and inaccessible to originated things, anti especially to men upon earth. When then men in infirmity invoke Him, when in persecution they ask help, when under injuries they pray, then the Invisible, being a lover of man, shines forth upon them with His beneficence. which He exercises through and in His proper Word. And forthwith the divine manifestation is made to every one according to his need, and is made to the weak health, and to the persecuted a `refuge' and `house of defence;' and to the injured He says, `While thou speakest I will say, Here I am[fn-57-P5755_2281806:387-nf] .' Whatever defence then comes to each through the Son, that each says that God has come to be to himself, since succour comes from God Himself through the Word. Moreover the usage of men recognises this, and every one will confess its propriety. Often succour comes from man to man; one has undertaken toil for the injured, as Abraham for Lot; and another has opened his home to the persecuted, as Obadiah to the sons of the prophets; and another has entertained a stranger, as Lot the Angels; and another has supplied the needy, as Job those who begged of him. And then, should one and the other of these benefited persons say, `Such a one became an assistance to me,' and another `and to me a refuge,' and `to another a supply,' yet in so saying would not be speaking of the original becoming or of the essence of their benefactors, but of the beneficence coming to themselves from them; so also when the saints say concerning God, `He became' and `become Thou,' they do not denote any original becoming, for God is without beginning and unoriginate, but the salvation which is made to be unto men from Him.","title":"Discourse I","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":58,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_76_xxiv_conference_of_abbot_abraham_","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"109","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"But all these things he will receive not with careless slackness and a lazy delight, but, in accordance with the Lord's word, \"with persecutions,\" i.e., with the pressure of this world, and terrible distress from his passions, because, as the wise man testifies: \"He who is easy going and without trouble shall come to want.\"[fn-68-P6839_2452451:63-nf] For not the slothful, or the careless, or the delicate, or the tender take the kingdom of heaven by force, but the violent. Who then are the violent? Surely they are those who show a splendid violence not to others, but to their own soul, who by a laudable force deprive it of all delights in things present, and are declared by the Lord's mouth to be splendid plunderers, and by rapine of this kind, violently seize upon the kingdom of heaven. For, as the Lord says, \"The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force.\"[fn-68-P6840_2453021:64-nf] Those are certainly worthy of praise as violent, who do violence to their own destruction, for, \"A man,\" as it is written, \"that is in sorrow laboureth for himself and does violence to his own destruction.\"[fn-68-P6841_2453255:65-nf] For our destruction is delight in this present life, and to speak more definitely, the performance of our own likes and desires, as, if a man withdraws these from his soul and mortifies them, he straightway does glorious and valuable violence to his own destruction, provided that he refuses to it the pleasantest of its wishes which the Divine word often rebukes by the prophet, saying: \"For in the days of your fast your own will is found;\" and again: \"If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, to do thy will on My holy day, and glorify him, while thou dost not thy own ways, and thy own will is not found, to speak a word.\" And the great blessedness that is promised to him is at once added by the prophet. \"Then,\" he says, \"shalt thou be delighted in the Lord, and I will lift thee up above the high places of the earth, and will feed thee with the inheritance of Jacob thy father.

Finally to bring this discussion to a close, I ask you, do not those who faithfully serve Christ, most clearly receive grace an hundredfold in this, while for His name's sake they are honoured by the greatest princes, and though they do not look for the praise of men, yet become venerated in the trials of persecution whose humble condition would perhaps have been looked down upon even by common folk, either because of their obscure birth, or because of their condition as slaves, if they had continued in their life in the world? But because of the service of Christ no one will venture to raise a calumny against their state of nobility, or to fling in their teeth the obscurity of their origin. Nay rather, through the very opprobrium of a humble condition by which others are shamed and confounded, the servants of Christ are more splendidly ennobled, as we can clearly show by the case of Abbot John who lives in the desert which borders on the town of Lycus. For he sprang from obscure parents, but owing to the name of Christ has become so well known to almost all mankind that the very lords of creation, who hold the reins of this world and of empire, and are a terror to all powers and kings, venerate him as their lord, and from distant countries seek his advice, and entrust to his prayers and merits the crown of their empire, and the state of safety, and the fortunes of war.[fn-68-P6844_2456069:68-nf] ","title":"XXIV.

This is a warning trumpet, and commands with great earnestness, that when we fast, we should hallow the fast.

For the boast of fasting did no good to the Pharisee, although he fasted twice in the week[fn-88-P8820_3241268:25-nf] , only because he exalted himself against the publican. In the same manner the Word blamed the children of Israel on account of such a fast as this, exhorting them by Isaiah the Prophet, and saying, `This is not the fast and the day that I have chosen, that a man should humble his soul; not even if thou shouldest bow down thy neck like a hook, and shouldest strew sackcloth and ashes under thee; neither thus shall ye call the fast acceptable[fn-88-P8821_3241735:26-nf] .' That we may be able to shew what kind of persons we should be when we fast, and of what character the fast should be, listen again to God commanding Moses, and saying, as it is written in Leviticus[fn-88-P8822_3241955:27-nf] , `And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, In the tenth day of this seventh month, there shall be a day of atonement; a convocation, and a holy day shall it be to you; and ye shall humble your souls, and offer whole burnt-offerings unto the Lord.' And afterwards, that the law might be defined on this point, He proceeds to say; `Every soul that shall not humble itself, shall be cut off from the people[fn-88-P8823_3242385:28-nf] .'","title":"Letter I.

I no sooner heard of this than I groaned over what had happened; pitying not you, my brethren, (God forbid!) but the men who are so sunk in wickedness as to carry their evil deeds to such an extent. I expected you all to hurry at once to the refuge prepared for you in my humble self; and I hoped that the Lord would give me refreshment in the midst of my continual troubles in embracing you, and in receiving on this inactive body of mine the noble sweat which you are dropping for the truth's sake, and so having some share in the prizes laid tip for you by the Judge of truth. But this did not enter into year minds, and you did not even expect any relief at my hands. I was therefore at least anxious to find frequent opportunities of writing to you, to the end that like those who cheer on combatants in the arena, I might myself by letter give you some encouragement in your good fight. For two reasons, however, I have not found this easy. In the first place, I did not know where you were residing. And, secondly, but few of our people travel in your direction. Now the Lord has brought us the very well beloved and reverend brother Sanctissimus, the presbyter. By him I am able to salute you, and I beseech you to pray for me, rejoicing and exulting that your reward is great in heaven,[fn-58-P5805_1822158:5-nf] and that you have freedom with the Lord to cease not day and night calling on Him to put an end to this storm of the Churches; to grant the shepherds to their flocks, and that the Church may return to her proper dignity. I am persuaded that if a voice be found to move our good God, He will not make His mercy afar off, but will now \"with the temptation make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.\"[fn-58-P5806_1822584:6-nf] Salute all the brethren in Christ in any name.","title":"Letter CCLVI.","author":"St. Basil"}]
