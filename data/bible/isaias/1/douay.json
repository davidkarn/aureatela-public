{"verses":["The vision of Isaias the Son of Amos, which he saw concerning Juda\nand Jerusalem in the days of Ozias, Joathan, Achaz, and Ezechias, kings\nof Juda.","Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the Lord hath\nspoken.  I have brought up children, and exalted them:  but they have\ndespised me.","The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib:  but\nIsrael hath not known me, and my people hath not understood.","Woe to the sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a wicked\nseed, ungracious children:  they have forsaken the Lord, they have\nblasphemed the Holy One of Israel, they are gone away backwards.","For what shall I strike you any more, you that increase\ntransgression?  the whole head is sick, and the whole heart is sad.","From the sole of the foot unto the top of the head, there is no\nsoundness therein:  wounds and bruises and swelling sores:  they are not\nbound up, nor dressed, nor fomented with oil.","Your land is desolate, your cities are burnt with fire:  your\ncountry strangers devour before your face, and it shall be desolate as\nwhen wasted by enemies.","And the daughter of Sion shall be left as a covert in a vineyard,\nand as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, and as a city that is laid\nwaste.","Except the Lord of hosts had left us seed, we had been as Sodom,\nand we should have been like to Gomorrha.","Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom, give ear to the\nlaw of our God, ye people of Gomorrha.","To what purpose do you offer me the multitude of your victims,\nsaith the Lord?  I am full, I desire not holocausts of rams, and fat of\nfatlings, and blood of calves, and lambs, and buck goats.","When you came to appear before me, who required these things at\nyour hands, that you should walk in my courts?","Offer sacrifice no more in vain:  incense is an abomination to me.\nThe new moons, and the sabbaths and other festivals I will not abide,\nyour assemblies are wicked.","My soul hateth your new moons, and your solemnities:  they are\nbecome troublesome to me, I am weary of bearing them.","And when you stretch forth your hands, I will turn away my eyes\nfrom you:  and when you multiply prayer, I will not hear:  for your hands\nare full of blood.","Wash yourselves, be clean, take away the evil of your devices\nfrom my eyes, cease to do perversely,","Learn to do well:  seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge for\nthe fatherless, defend the widow.","And then come, and accuse me, saith the Lord:  if your sins be as\nscarlet, they shall be made as white as snow:  and if they be red as\ncrimson, they shall be white as wool.","If you be willing, and will hearken to me, you shall eat the good\nthings of the land.","But if you will not, and will provoke me to wrath:  the sword\nshall devour you because the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.","How is the faithful city, that was full of judgment, become a\nharlot?  justice dwelt in it, but now murderers.","Thy silver is turned into dross:  thy wine is mingled with water.","Thy princes are faithless, companions of thieves:  they all love\nbribes, they run after rewards.  They judge not for the fatherless:  and\nthe widow's cause cometh not in to them.","Therefore saith the Lord the God of hosts, the mighty one of\nIsrael:  Ah! I will comfort myself over my adversaries:  and I will be\nrevenged of my enemies.","And I will turn my hand to thee, and I will clean purge away thy\ndross, and I will take away all thy tin.","And I will restore thy judges as they were before, and thy\ncounsellors as of old.  After this thou shalt be called the city of the\njust, a faithful city.","Sion shall be redeemed in judgment, and they shall bring her back\nin justice.","And he shall destroy the wicked, and the sinners together:  and\nthey that have forsaken the Lord, shall be consumed.","For they shall be confounded for the idols, to which they have\nsacrificed:  and you shall be ashamed of the gardens which you have\nchosen.","When you shall be as an oak with the leaves falling off, and as a\ngarden without water.","And your strength shall be as the ashes of tow, and your work as\na spark:  and both shall burn together, and there shall be none to\nquench it."]}
