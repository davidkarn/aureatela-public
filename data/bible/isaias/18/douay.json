{"verses":["Woe to the land, the winged cymbal, which is beyond the rivers of\nEthiopia,","That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, and in vessels of bulrushes\nupon the waters.  Go, ye swift angels, to a nation rent and torn in\npieces:  to a terrible people, after which there is no other:  to a\nnation expecting and trodden underfoot, whose land the rivers have\nspoiled.","All ye inhabitants of the world, who dwell on the earth, when the\nsign shall be lifted up on the mountains, you shall see, and you shall\nhear the sound of the trumpet.","For thus saith the Lord to me:  I will take my rest, and consider\nin my place, as the noon light is clear, and as a cloud of dew in the\nday of harvest.","For before the harvest it was all flourishing, and it shall bud\nwithout perfect ripeness, and the sprigs thereof shall be cut off with\npruning hooks:  and what is left shall be cut away and shaken out.","And they shall be left together to the birds of the mountains,\nand the beasts of the earth:  and the fowls shall be upon them all the\nsummer, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.","At that time shall a present be brought to the Lord of hosts,\nfrom a people rent and torn in pieces:  from a terrible people, after\nwhich there hath been no other:  from a nation expecting, expecting and\ntrodden under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the place of\nthe name of the Lord of hosts, to mount Sion."]}
