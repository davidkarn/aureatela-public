{"verses":["The land that was desolate and impassable shall be glad, and the\nwilderness shall rejoice, and shall flourish like the lily.","It shall bud forth and blossom, and shall rejoice with joy and\npraise:  the glory of Libanus is given to it:  the beauty of Carmel, and\nSaron, they shall see the glory of the Lord, and the beauty of our God.","Strengthen ye the feeble hands, and confirm the weak knees.","Say to the fainthearted:  Take courage, and fear not:  behold your\nGod will bring the revenge of recompense:  God himself will come and\nwill save you.","Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the\ndeaf shall be unstopped.","Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of the\ndumb shall be free:  for waters are broken out in the desert, and\nstreams in the wilderness.","And that which was dry land, shall become a pool, and the thirsty\nland springs of water.  In the dens where dragons dwelt before, shall\nrise up the verdure of the reed and the bulrush.","And a path and a way shall be there, and it shall be called the\nholy way:  the unclean shall not pass over it, and this shall be unto\nyou a straight way, so that fools shall not err therein.","No lion shall be there, nor shall any mischievous beast go up by\nit, nor be found there:  but they shall walk there that shall be\ndelivered.","And the redeemed of the Lord shall return, and shall come into\nSion with praise, and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads:  they\nshall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and mourning shall flee away."]}
