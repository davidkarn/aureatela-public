{"verses":["The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because the Lord hath anointed\nme:  he hath sent me to preach to the meek, to heal the contrite of\nheart, and to preach a release to the captives, and deliverance to them\nthat are shut up.","To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of\nvengeance of our God:  to comfort all that mourn:","To appoint to the mourners of Sion, and to give them a crown for\nashes, the oil of joy for mourning, a garment of praise for the spirit\nof grief:  and they shall be called in it the mighty ones of justice,\nthe planting of the Lord to glorify him.","And they shall build the places that have been waste from of old,\nand shall raise up ancient ruins, and shall repair the desolate cities,\nthat were destroyed for generation and generation.","And strangers shall stand and shall feed your flocks:  and the\nsons of strangers shall be your husbandman, and the dressers of your\nvines.","But you shall be called the priests of the Lord:  to you it shall\nbe said:  Ye ministers of our God:  you shall eat the riches of the\nGentiles, and you shall pride yourselves in their glory.","For your double confusion and shame, they shall praise their\npart:  therefore shall they receive double in their land, everlasting\njoy shall be unto them.","For I am the Lord that love judgment, and hate robbery in a\nholocaust:  and I will make their work in truth, and I will make a\nperpetual covenant with them.","And they shall know their seed among the Gentiles, and their\noffspring in the midst of peoples:  all that shall see them, shall know\nthem, that these are the seed which the Lord hath blessed.","I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, and my soul shall be joyful\nin my God:  for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation:  and\nwith the robe of justice he hath covered me, as a bridegroom decked\nwith a crown, and as a bride adorned with her jewels.","For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden\ncauseth her seed to shoot forth:  so shall the Lord God make justice to\nspring forth, and praise before all the nations."]}
