{"verses":["In the year that king Ozias died, I saw the Lord sitting upon a\nthrone high and elevated:  and his train filled the temple.","Upon it stood the seraphims:  the one had six wings, and the other\nhad six wings:  with two they covered his face, and with two they\ncovered his feet, and with two they flew.","And they cried one to another, and said:  Holy, holy, holy, the\nLord God of hosts, all the earth is full of his glory,","And the lintels of the doors were moved at the voice of him that\ncried, and the house was filled with smoke.","And I said:  Woe is me, because I have held my peace; because I am\na man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people that hath\nunclean lips, and I have seen with my eyes the King the Lord of hosts.","And one of the seraphims flew to me, and in his hand was a live\ncoal, which he had taken with the tongs off the altar.","And he touched my mouth, and said:  Behold this hath touched thy\nlips, and thy iniquities shall be taken away, and thy sin shall be\ncleansed.","And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying:  Whom shall I send?  and\nwho shall go for us?  And I said:  Lo, here am I, send me.","And he said:  Go, and thou shalt say to this people:  Hearing, hear,\nand understand not:  and see the vision, and know it not.","Blind the heart of this people, and make their ears heavy, and\nshut their eyes:  lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their\nears, and understand with their heart, and be converted and I heal\nthem.","And I said:  How long, O Lord?  And he said:  Until the cities be\nwasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land\nshall be left desolate.","And the Lord shall remove men far away, and she shall be\nmultiplied that was left in the midst of the earth.","And there shall be still a tithing therein, and she shall turn,\nand shall be made a show as a turpentine tree, and as an oak that\nspreadeth its branches:  that which shall stand therein, shall be a holy\nseed."]}
