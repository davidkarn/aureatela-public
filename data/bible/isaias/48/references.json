For this reason, then, if both the Son and the Holy Spirit are sent thither where they were, we must inquire, how that sending, whether of the Son or of the Holy Spirit, is to be understood; for of the Father alone, we nowhere read that He is sent. Now, of the Son, the apostle writes thus: \"But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law.\"[fn-4-P476_170738:23-nf] \"He sent,\" he says, \"His Son, made of a woman.\" And by this term, woman,[fn-4-P477_170831:24-nf] what Catholic does not know that he did not wish to signify the privation of virginity; but, according to a Hebraism, the difference of sex? When, therefore, he says, \"God sent His Son, made of a woman,\" he sufficiently shows that the Son was \"sent\" in this very way, in that He was \"made of a woman.\"Therefore, in that He was born of God, He was in the world; but in that He was born of Mary, He was sent and came into the world. Moreover, He could not be sent by the Father without the Holy Spirit, not only because the Father, when He sent Him, that is, when He made Him of a woman, is certainly understood not to have so made Him without His own Spirit; but also because it is most plainly and expressly said in the Gospel in answer to the Virgin Mary, when she asked of the angel, \"How shall this be?\" \"The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee.\"[fn-4-P478_171744:25-nf] And Matthew says, \"She was found with child of the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-4-P479_171829:26-nf] Although, too, in the prophet Isaiah, Christ Himself is understood to say of His own future advent, \"And now the Lord God and His Spirit hath sent me.\"[fn-4-P480_171999:27-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":48,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"144","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"It is the Spirit which says, as the Lord says, \"Get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.\"[fn-16-P1682_428739:427-nf] Are these the words of an inferior, or of one in dread? \"Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.\"[fn-16-P1683_428890:428-nf] Does a slave speak thus?

Seeing that they, with their untrained and narrow intelligence, were disposed to look with wonder on the beauties of nature, not employing the things they beheld as a leader and guide to the beauty of the Nature that transcends them, they rather made their intelligence halt on arriving at the objects of its apprehension, and marvelled at each part of the creation severally-for this cause they did not stay their conception of the Deity at any single one of the things they beheld, but deemed everything they looked on in creation to be divine. And thus with the Egyptians, as the error developed its force more in respect of intellectual objects, the countless forms of spiritual beings were reckoned to be so many natures of Gods; while with the Babylonians the unerring circuit of the firmament was accounted a God, to whom they also gave the name of Bel. So, too, the foolishness of the heathen deifying individually the seven successive spheres, one bowed down to one, another to another, according to some individual form of error. For as they perceived all these circles moving in mutual relation, seeing that they had gone astray as to the most exalted, they maintained the same error by logical sequence, even to the last of them. And in addition to these, the aether itself, and the atmosphere diffused beneath it, the earth and sea and the subterranean region, and in the earth itself all things which are useful or needful for man's life,-of all these there was none which they held to be without part or lot in the Divine nature, but they bowed down to each of them, bringing themselves, by means of some one of the objects conspicuous in the creation, into bondage to all the successive parts of the creation, in such a way that, had the act of reverencing the creation been from the beginning even to them a thing evidently unlawful, they would not have been led astray into this deceit of polytheism. Let us look to it, then, lest we too share the same fate,-we who in being taught by Scripture to reverence the true Godhead, were trained to consider all created existence as external to the Divine nature, and to worship and revere that uncreated Nature alone, Whose characteristic and token is that it never either begins to be or ceases to be; since the great Isaiah thus speaks of the Divine nature with reference to these doctrines, in his exalted utterance,-who speaks in the person of the Deity, \"I am the first, and hereafter am I, and no God was before Me, and no God shall be after Me[fn-15-P1580_908359:4-nf] .\" For knowing more perfectly than all others the mystery of the religion of the Gospel, this great prophet, who foretold even that marvellous sign concerning the Virgin, and gave us the good tidings[fn-15-P1581_908957:5-nf] of the birth of the Child, and clearly pointed out to us that Name of the Son,-he, in a word, who by the Spirit includes in himself all the truth,-in order that the characteristic of the Divine Nature, whereby we discern that which really is from that which came into being, might be made as plain as possible to all, utters this saying in the person of God: \"I am the first, and hereafter am I, and before Me no God hath been, and after Me is none.\" Since, then, neither is that God which was before God, nor is that God which is after God, (for that which is after God is the creation, and that which is anterior to God is nothing, and Nothing is not God;-or one should rather say, that which is anterior to God is God in His eternal blessedness, defined in contradistinction to Nothing[fn-15-P1582_909766:6-nf] ;-since, I say, this inspired utterance was spoken by the mouth of the prophet, we learn by his means the doctrine that the Divine Nature is one, continuous with Itself and indiscerptible, not admitting in Itself priority and posteriority, though it be declared in Trinity, and with no one of the things we contemplate in it more ancient or more recent than another. Since, then, the saying is the saying of God, whether you grant that the words are the words of the Father or of the Son, the orthodox doctrine is equally upheld by either. For if it is the Father that speaks thus, He bears witness to the Son that He is not \"after\" Himself: for if the Son is God, and whatever is \"after\" the Father is not God, it is clear that the saying bears witness to the truth that the Son is in the Father, and not after the Father. If, on the other hand, one were to grant that this utterance is of the Son, the phrase, \"None hath been before Me,\" will be a clear intimation that He Whom we contemplate \"in the Beginning[fn-15-P1583_911186:7-nf] \" is apprehended together with the eternity of the Beginning. If, then, anything is \"after\" God, this is discovered, by the passages quoted, to be a creature, and not God: for He says, \"That which is after Me is not God[fn-15-P1584_911423:8-nf] .\"","title":"Book V","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":48,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_16_book_v","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"To show that I am not making a random statement beyond what probability admits of, I will cite as a credible testimony in favour of my assertion the error which still prevails among the heathen[fn-15-P1579_905741:3-nf] .

Yea, the greater we see the power of the demons to be in these depths, so much the more tenaciously must we cleave to the Mediator through whom we ascend from these lowest to the highest places. For if we should say these things are not to be credited, there are not wanting even now some who would affirm that they had either heard on the best authority, or even themselves experienced, something of that kind. Indeed we ourselves, when in Italy, heard such things about a certain region there where landladies of inns, imbued with these wicked arts, were said to be in the habit of giving to such travellers as they chose, or could manage, something in a piece of cheese by which they were changed on the spot into beasts of burden, and carried whatever was necessary, and were restored to their own form when the work was done. Yet their mind did not become bestial, but remained rational and human, just as Apuleius, in the books he wrote with the title of The Golden Ass, has told, or feigned, that it happened to his own self that, on taking poison, he became an ass, while retaining his human mind.","title":"Book XVIII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":48,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_26_book_xx","source_chapter":32,"source_paragraph":"121","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"There are many other passages of Scripture bearing on the last judgment of God,-so many, indeed, that to cite them all would swell this book to an unpardonable size. Suffice it to have proved that both Old and New Testament enounce the judgment. But in the Old it is not so definitely declared as in the New that the judgment shall be administered by Christ, that is, that Christ shall descend from heaven as the Judge; for when it is therein stated by the Lord God or His prophet that the Lord God shall come, we do not necessarily understand this of Christ. For both the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost are the Lord God. We must not, however, leave this without proof. And therefore we must first show how Jesus Christ speaks in the prophetical books under the title of the Lord God, while yet there can be no doubt that it is Jesus Christ who speaks; so that in other passages where this is not at once apparent, and where nevertheless it is said that the Lord God will come to that last judgment, we may understand that Jesus Christ is meant. There is a passage in the prophet Isaiah which illustrates what I mean. For God says by the prophet, \"Hear me, Jacob and Israel, whom I call. I am the first, and I am for ever: and my hand has rounded the earth, and my right hand has established the heaven. I will call them, and they shall stand together, and be gathered, and hear. Who has declared to them these things? In love of thee I have done thy pleasure upon Babylon, that I might take away the seed of the Chaldeans. I have spoken, and I have called: I have brought him, and have made his way prosperous. Come ye near unto me, and hear this. I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; when they were made, there was I. And now the Lord God and His Spirit hath sent me.\"[fn-40-P4052_2218663:165-nf] It was Himself who was speaking as the Lord God; and yet we should not have understood that it was Jesus Christ had He not added, \"And now the Lord God and His Spirit hath sent me.\" For He said this with reference to the form of a servant, speaking of a future event as if it were past, as in the same prophet we read, \"He was led as a sheep to the slaughter,\"[fn-40-P4053_2219051:166-nf] not \"He shall be led;\" but the past tense is used to express the future.

At length on the seventh day He rested from His works. Both one and the other were after His manner. If, on the contrary,[fn-87-P8772_2446119:473-nf] He made this world simply by appearing and approaching it, did He, on the completion of His work, cease to appear and approach it any more. Nay rather,[fn-87-P8773_2446286:474-nf] God began to appear more conspicuously and to be everywhere accessible[fn-87-P8774_2446372:475-nf] from the time when the world was made. You see, therefore, how all things consist by the operation of that God who \"made the earth by His power, who established the world by His wisdom, and stretched out the heaven by His understanding; \"not appearing merely, nor approaching, but applying the almighty efforts of His mind, His wisdom, His power, His understanding, His word, His Spirit, His might. Now these things were not necessary to Him, if He had been perfect by simply appearing and approaching. They are, however, His \"invisible things,\" which, according to the apostle, \"are from the creation of the world clearly seen by the things that are made;[fn-87-P8775_2447054:476-nf] they are no parts of a nondescript[fn-87-P8776_2447108:477-nf] Matter, but they are the sensible[fn-87-P8777_2447162:478-nf] evidences of Himself. \"For who hath known the mind of the Lord,\"[fn-87-P8778_2447245:479-nf] of which (the apostle) exclaims: \"O the depth of the riches both of His wisdom and knowledge! how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out! \"[fn-87-P8779_2447428:480-nf] Now what clearer truth do these words indicate, than that all things were made out of nothing? They are incapable of being found out or investigated, except by God alone. Otherwise, if they were traceable or discoverable in Matter, they would be capable of investigation. Therefore, in as far as it has become evident that Matter had no prior existence (even from this circumstance, that it is impossible[fn-87-P8780_2447849:481-nf] for it to have had such an existence as is assigned to it), in so far is it proved that all things were made by God out of nothing. It must be admitted, however,[fn-87-P8781_2448032:482-nf] that Hermogenes, by describing for Matter a condition like his own-irregular, confused, turbulent, of a doubtful and precipate and fervid impulse-has displayed a specimen of his own art, and painted his own portrait.

And the Apostle Paul says in the Epistle to the Hebrews:[fn-64-P6461_1077104:22-nf] \"At the end of the days He spoke to us in His Son, whom He made the heir of all things, 'through whom' also He made the ages,\" showing us that God made the ages through His Son, the\" through whom\" belonging, when the ages were being made, to the Only-begotten. Thus, if all things were made, as in this passage also, through the Logos, then they were not made by the Logos, but by a stronger and greater than He. And who else could this be but the Father? Now if, as we have seen, all things were made through Him, we have to enquire if the Holy Spirit also was made through Him. it appears to me that those who hold the Holy Spirit to be created, and who also admit that \"all things were made through Him,\" must necessarily assume that the Holy Spirit was made through the Logos, the Logos accordingly being older than He. And he who shrinks from allowing the Holy Spirit to have been made through Christ must, if he admits the truth of the statements of this Gospel, assume the Spirit to be uncreated. There is a third resource besides these two (that of allowing the Spirit to have been made by the Word, and that of regarding it as uncreated), namely, to assert that the Holy Spirit has no essence of His own beyond the Father and the Son. But on further thought one may perhaps see reason to consider that the Son is second beside the Father, He being the same as the Father, while manifestly a distinction is drawn between the Spirit and the Son in the passage,[fn-64-P6462_1078585:23-nf] \"Whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of Man. it shall be forgiven him, but whosoever shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit, he shall not have forgiveness, either in this world or in the world to come.\" We consider, therefore, that there are three hypostases, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit; and at the same thee we believe nothing to be uncreated but the Father. We therefore, as the more pious and the truer course, admit that all things were made by the Logos, and that the Holy Spirit is the most excellent and the first in order[fn-64-P6463_1079161:24-nf] of all that was made by the Father through Christ. And this, perhaps, is the reason why the Spirit is not said to be God's own Son. The Only-begotten only is by nature and from the beginning a Son, and the Holy Spirit seems to have need of the Son, to minister to Him His essence, so as to enable Him not only to exist, but to be wise and reasonable and just, and all that we must think of Him as being. All this He has by participation of the character of Christ, of which we have spoken above. And I consider that the Holy Spirit supplies to those who, through Him and through participation in Him, are called saints, the material of the gifts, which come from God; so that the said material of the gifts is made powerful by God, is ministered by Christ, and owes its actual existence in men to the Holy Spirit. I am led to this view of the charisms by the words of Paul which he writes somewhere,[fn-64-P6464_1080100:25-nf] \"There are diversities of gifts but the same Spirit, and diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord. And there are diversities of workings, but it is the same God that worketh all in all.\" The statement that all things were made by Him, and its seeming corollary, that the Spirit must have been called into being by the Word, may certainly raise some difficulty. There are some passages in which the Spirit is placed above Christ; in Isaiah, for example, Christ declares that He is sent, not by the Father only, but also by the Holy Spirit. \"Now the Lord hath sent Me,\" He says,[fn-64-P6465_1080706:26-nf] \"and His Spirit.\" and in the Gospel He declares that there is forgiveness for the sin committed against Himself, but that for blasphemy against the Holy Spirit there is no forgiveness, either in this age or in the age to come. What is the reason of this? Is it because the Holy Spirit is of more value than Christ that the sin against Him cannot be forgiven? May it not rather be that all rational beings have part in Christ, and that forgiveness is extended to them when they repent of their sins, while only those have part in the Holy Spirit who have been found worthy of it, and that there cannot well be any forgiveness for those who fall away to evil in spite of such great and powerful cooperation, and who defeat the counsels of the Spirit who is in them. When we find the Lord saying, as He does in Isaiah, that He is sent by the Father and by His Spirit, we have to point out here also that the Spirit is not originally superior to the Saviour, but that the Saviour takes a lower place than He in order to carry out the plan which has been made that the Son of God should become man. Should any one stumble at our saying that the Saviour in becoming man was made lower than the Holy Spirit, we ask him to consider the words used in the Epistle to the Hebrews,[fn-64-P6466_1081998:27-nf] where Jesus is shown by Paul to have been made less than the angels on account of the suffering of death. \"We behold Him,\" he says, \"who hath been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus, because of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour.\" And this, too, has doubtless to be added, that the creation, in order to be delivered from the bondage of corruption, and not least of all the human race, required the introduction into human nature of a happy and divine power, which should set right what was wrong upon the earth, and that this action fell to the share, as it were, of the Holy Spirit; but the Spirit, unable to support such a task, puts forward the Saviour as the only one able to endure such a conflict. The Father therefore, the principal, sends the Son, but the Holy Spirit also sends Him and directs Him to go before, promising to descend, when the thee comes, to the Son of God, and to work with Him for the salvation of men. This He did. when, in a bodily shape like a dove, He flew to Him after the baptism. He remained on Him, and did not pass Him by, as He might have done with men not able continuously to bear His glory. Thus John, when explaining how he knew who Christ was, spoke not only of the descent of the Spirit on Jesus, but also of its remaining upon him. For it is written that John said:[fn-64-P6467_1083348:28-nf] \"He who sent me to baptize said, On whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, the same is He that baptizeth with the Holy Spirit and with fire.\" It is not said only, \"On whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending,\" for the Spirit no doubt descended on others too, but \"descending and abiding on Him.\" Our examination of this point has been somewhat extended, since we were anxious to make it clear that if all things were made by Him, then the Spirit also was made through the Word, and is seen to be one of the \"all things\" which are inferior to their Maker. This view is too firmly settled to be disturbed by a few words which may be adduced to the opposite effect. If any one should lend credence to the Gospel according to the Hebrews, where the Saviour Himself says, \"My mother, the Holy Spirit took me just now by one of my hairs and carried me off to the great mount Tabor,\" he will have to face the difficulty of explaining how the Holy Spirit can be the mother of Christ when it was itself brought into existence through the Word. But neither the passage nor this difficulty is hard to explain. For if he who does the will of the Father in heaven[fn-64-P6468_1084554:29-nf] is Christ's brother and sister and mother, and if the name of brother of Christ may be applied, not only to the race of men, but to beings of diviner rank than they, then there is nothing absurd in the Holy Spirit's being His mother, every one being His mother who does the will of the Father in heaven.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":48,"verse":16,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_55_book_i_","source_chapter":47,"source_paragraph":"170","folder":"ANF-04","text":"For the law and the prophets are full of marvels similar to those recorded of Jesus at His baptism, viz., regarding the dove and the voice from heaven.

And I shall refer not only to His miracles, but, as is proper, to those also of the apostles of Jesus. For they could not without the help of miracles and wonders have prevailed on those who heard their new doctrines and new teachings to abandon their national usages, and to accept their instructions at the danger to themselves even of death. And there are still preserved among Christians traces of that Holy Spirit which appeared in the form of a dove. They expel evil spirits, and perform many cures, and foresee certain events, according to the will of the Logos. And although Celsus, or the Jew whom he has introduced, may treat with mockery what I am going to say, I shall say it nevertheless,-that many have been converted to Christianity as if against their will, some sort of spirit having suddenly transformed their minds from a hatred of the doctrine to a readiness to die in its defence, and having appeared to them either in a waking vision or a dream of the night. Many such instances have we known, which, if we were to commit to writing, although they were seen and witnessed by ourselves, we should afford great occasion for ridicule to unbelievers, who would imagine that we, like those whom they suppose to have invented such things, had ourselves also done the same. But God is witness of our conscientious desire, not by false statements, but by testimonies of different kinds, to establish the divinity of the doctrine of Jesus. And as it is a Jew who is perplexed about the account of the Holy Spirit having descended upon Jesus in the form of a dove, we would say to him, \"Sir, who is it that says in Isaiah, `And now the Lord hath sent me and His Spirit?'\"[fn-78-P7852_1878245:75-nf] In which sentence, as the meaning is doubtful-viz., whether the Father and the Holy Spirit sent Jesus, or the Father sent both Christ and the Holy Spirit-the latter is correct.

For if God is Father of a word at all, wherefore is not He that is begotten a Son? And again, who should be Son of God, but His Word? For there are not many words, or each would be imperfect, but one is the Word, that He only may be perfect, and because, God being one, His Image too must be one, which is the Son.

Solomon also received the same from God, and said, `The Lord by wisdom founded the earth[fn-33-P3347_1320751:122-nf] ,' and John, knowing that the Word was the Hand and the Wisdom, thus preached, `In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; the same was in the beginning with God: all things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made[fn-33-P3348_1321040:123-nf] .' And the Apostle, seeing that the Hand and the Wisdom and the Word was nothing else than the Son, says, `God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by His Son, whom He hath appointed Heir of all things, by whom also He made the ages[fn-33-P3349_1321391:124-nf] .'

I mean by those who are still troubled by carnal sins, as for instance, if, when they are troubled by the spirit of fornication, they formed an idea of the dignity of the priesthood, or of reputation among all men, by which they maybe thought saints and immaculate: and so with these considerations they repell the unclean suggestions of lust, as deeming them base and at least unworthy of their rank and reputation; and so by means of a smaller evil they overcome a greater one. For it is better for a man to be troubled by the sin of vainglory than for him to fall into the desire for fornication, from which he either cannot recover at all or only with great difficulty after he has fallen. And this thought is admirably expressed byone of the prophets speaking in the person of God, and saying: \"For My name's sake I will remove My wrath afar off: and with My praise I will bridle thee lest thou shouldest perish,\"[fn-41-P4156_1536813:24-nf] i.e., while you are enchained by the praises of vainglory, you cannot possibly rush on into the depths of hell, or plunge irrevocably into the commission of deadly sins. Nor need we wonder that this passion has the power of checking anyone from rushing into the sin of fornication, since it has been again and again proved by many examples that when once a man has been affected by its poison and plague, it makes him utterly indefatigable, so that he scarcely feels a fast of even two or three days. And we have often known some who are living in this desert, confessing that when their home was in the monasteries of Syria they could without difficulty go for five days without food, while now they are so overcome with hunger even by the third hour, that they can scarcely keep ontheir daily fast tothe ninth hour. And on this subject there is a very neat answer of Abbot Macarius[fn-41-P4157_1537717:25-nf] to one who asked him why he was troubled with hunger as early as the third hour in the desert, when in the monastery he had often scorned food for a whole week, without feeling hungry. \"Because,\" said he, \"here there is nobody to see your fast, and feed and support you with his praise of you: but there you grew fat on the notice of others and the food of vainglory.\" And of the way in which, as we said, the sin of fornication is prevented by an attack of vainglory, there is an excellent and significant figure in the book of Kings, where, when the children of Israel had been taken captive by Necho, King of Egypt, Nebuchadnezzar, King of Assyria, came up and brought them back from the borders of Egypt to their own country, not indeed meaning to restore them to their former liberty and their native land, but meaning to carry them off to his own land and to transport them to a still more distant country than the land of Egypt in which they had been prisoners. And this illustration exactly applies to the case before us. For though there is less harm in yielding to the sin of vainglory than to fornication, yet it is more difficult to escape from the dominion of vainglory. For somehow or other the prisoner who is carried off to a greater distance, will have more difficulty in returning to his native land and the freedom of his fathers, and the prophet's rebuke will be deservedly aimed at him: \"Wherefore art thou grown old in a strange country?[fn-41-P4158_1539217:26-nf] since a man is rightly said to have grown old in a strange country, if he has not broken up the Found of his faults. Of pride there are two kinds: (I) carnal, and (2) spiritual, which is the worse. For it especially attacks those who are seen to have made progress in some good qualities.","title":"V.

Now those who do not observe the feast, continue such as these even to the present day, feigning indeed and devising names of feasts[fn-88-P8877_3258638:18-nf] , but rather introducing days of mourning than of gladness; `For there is no peace to the wicked, saith the Lord[fn-88-P8878_3258969:19-nf] .' And as Wisdom saith, `Gladness and joy are taken from their mouth[fn-88-P8879_3259059:20-nf] .' Such are the feasts of the wicked. But the wise servants of the Lord, who have truly put on the man which is created in God[fn-88-P8880_3259214:21-nf] , have received gospel words, and reckon as a general commandment that given to Timothy, which saith, `Be thou an example to the believers in word, in conversation, in love, in faith, in purity[fn-88-P8881_3259426:22-nf] .' So well do they keep the Feast, that even the unbelievers, seeing their order[fn-88-P8882_3259527:23-nf] , may say, `God is with them of a truth[fn-88-P8883_3259623:24-nf] .' For as he who receives an apostle receives Him who sent him[fn-88-P8884_3259707:25-nf] , so he who is a follower of the saints, makes the Lord in every respect his end and aim, even as Paul, being a follower of Him, goes on to say, `As I also of Christ[fn-88-P8885_3259891:26-nf] .' For there were first our Saviour's own words, who from the height of His divinity, when conversing with His disciples, said, `Learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest to your souls[fn-88-P8886_3260123:27-nf] .' Then too when He poured water into a basin, and girded HimseIf with a towel, and washed His disciples' feet, He said to them, `Know what I have done. Ye call Me Master and Lord, and ye say well, for so I am.

For what else is the feast, but the service of the soul? And what is that service, but prolonged prayer to God, and unceasing thanksgiving[fn-89-P8925_3269933:7-nf] ? The unthankful departing far from these are rightly deprived of the joy springing therefrom: for `joy and gladness are taken from their mouth[fn-89-P8926_3270223:8-nf] .' Therefore, the [divine] word doth not allow them to have peace; `For there is no peace to the wicked, saith the Lord[fn-89-P8927_3270529:9-nf] ,' they labour in pain and grief. So, not even to him who owed ten thousand talents did the Gospel grant forgiveness in the sight of the Lord[fn-89-P8928_3270691:10-nf] . For even he, having received forgiveness of great things, was forgetful of kindness in little ones, so that he paid the penalty also of those former things. And justly indeed, for having himself experienced kindness, he was required to be merciful to his fellow servant. He too that received the one talent, and bound it up in a napkin, and hid it in the earth, was in consequence cast out for unthankfulness, hearing the words, `Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed; thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and on my return, I should have received mine own. Take therefore the talent from him, and give it to him that hath ten talents[fn-89-P8929_3271452:11-nf] .' For, of course, when he was required to deliver up to his lord that which belonged to him, he should have acknowledged the kindness of him who gave it, and the value of that which was given. For he who gave was not a hard man, had he been so, he would not have given even in the first instance; neither was that which was given unprofitable and vain, for then he had not found fault. But both he who gave was good, and that which was given was capable of bearing fruit. As therefore `he who withholdeth corn in seed-time is cursed[fn-89-P8930_3272006:12-nf] ,' according to the divine proverb, so he who neglects grace, and hides it without culture, is properly cast out as a wicked and unthankful person. On this account, he praises those who increased [their talents], saying, `Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful in a little, I will place thee over much; enter into the joy of thy Lord[fn-89-P8931_3272382:13-nf] .'","title":"Letter III.

But as often as water is named alone in the Holy Scriptures, baptism is referred to, as we see intimated in Isaiah: \"Remember not,\" says he, \"the former things, and consider not the things of old. Behold, I will do a new thing, which shall now spring forth; and ye shall know it. I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the dry place, to give drink to my elected people, my people whom I have purchased, that they might show forth my praise.\"[fn-59-P5974_1878629:14-nf] There God foretold by the prophet, that among the nations, in places which previously had been dry, rivers should afterwards flow plenteously, and should provide water for the elected people of God, that is, for those who were made sons of God by the generation of baptism.[fn-59-P5975_1878927:15-nf] Moreover, it is again predicted and foretold before, that the Jews, if they should thirst and seek after Christ, should drink with us, that is, should attain the grace of baptism. \"If they shall thirst,\" he says, \"He shall lead them through the deserts, shall bring forth water for them out of the rock; the rock shall be cloven, and the water shall flow, and my people shall drink; \"[fn-59-P5976_1879434:16-nf] which is fulfilled in the Gospel, when Christ, who is the Rock, is cloven by a stroke of the spear in His passion; who also, admonishing what was before announced by the prophet, cries and says, \"If any man thirst, let him come and drink. He that believeth on me, as the Scripture saith, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.\" And that it might be more evident that the Lord is speaking there, not of the cup, but of baptism, the Scripture adds, saying, \"But this spake He of the Spirit, which they that believe on Him should receive.\"[fn-59-P5977_1880006:17-nf] For by baptism the Holy Spirit is received; and thus by those who are baptized, and have attained to the Holy Spirit, is attained the drinking of the Lord's cup. And let it disturb no one, that when the divine Scrip-lure speaks of baptism, it says that we thirst and drink, since the Lord also in the Gospel says, \"Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness; \"[fn-59-P5978_1880409:18-nf] because what is received with a greedy and thirsting desire is drunk more fully and plentifully. As also, in another place, the Lord speaks to the Samaritan woman, saying, \"Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again; but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him, shall not thirst for ever.\"[fn-59-P5979_1880739:19-nf] By which is also signified the very baptism of saving water, which indeed is once received, and is not again repeated. But the cup of the Lord is always both thirsted for and drunk in the Church.","title":"Epistle LXII.","author":"Cyprian"}]
