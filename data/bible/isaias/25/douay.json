{"verses":["O Lord, thou art my God, I will exalt O thee, and give glory to\nthy name:  for thou hast done wonderful things, thy designs of old\nfaithful, amen.","For thou hast reduced the city to a heap, the strong city to\nruin, the house of strangers, to be no city, and to be no more built up\nfor ever.","Therefore shall a strong people praise thee, the city of mighty\nnations shall fear thee.","Because thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the\nneedy in his distress:  a refuge from the whirlwind, a shadow from the\nheat.  For the blast of the mighty is like a whirlwind beating against a\nwall.","Thou shalt bring down the tumult of strangers, as heat in thirst:\nand as with heat under a burning cloud, thou shalt make the branch of\nthe mighty to wither away.","And the Lord of hosts shall make unto all people in this\nmountain, a feast of fat things, a feast of wine, of fat things full of\nmarrow, of wine purified from the lees.","And he shall destroy in this mountain the face of the bond with\nwhich all people were tied, and the web that he began over all nations.","He shall cast death down headlong for ever:  and the Lord God\nshall wipe away tears from every face, and the reproach of his people\nhe shall take away from off the whole earth:  for the Lord hath spoken\nit.","And they shall say in that day:  Lo, this is our God, we have\nwaited for him, and he will save us:  this is the Lord, we have\npatiently waited for him, we shall rejoice and be joyful in his\nsalvation.","For the hand of the Lord shall rest in this mountain:  and Moab\nshall be trodden down under him, as straw is broken in pieces with the\nwain.","And he shall stretch forth his hands under him, as he that\nswimmeth stretcheth forth his hands to swim:  and he shall bring down\nhis glory with the dashing of his hands.","And the bulwarks of thy high walls shall fall, and be brought\nlow, and shall be pulled down to the ground, even to the dust."]}
