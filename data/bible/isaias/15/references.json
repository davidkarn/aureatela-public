Then immediately quickening her pace she began to move along the old road which leads to Gaza, that is to the `power' or `wealth' of God, silently meditating on that type of the Gentiles, the Ethiopian eunuch, who in spite of the prophet changed his skin[fn-39-P3948_1065228:2813-nf] and whilst he read the old testament found the fountain of the gospel.[fn-39-P3949_1065373:2814-nf] Next turning to the right she passed from Bethzur[fn-39-P3950_1065460:2815-nf] to Eshcol which means \"a cluster of grapes.\" It was hence that the spies brought back that marvellous cluster which was the proof of the fertility of the land[fn-39-P3951_1065643:2816-nf] and a type of Him who says of Himself: \"I have trodden the wine press alone; and of the people there was none with me.\"[fn-39-P3952_1065805:2817-nf] Shortly afterwards she entered the home[fn-39-P3953_1065898:2818-nf] of Sarah and beheld the birthplace of Isaac and the traces of Abraham's oak under which he saw Christ's day and was glad.[fn-39-P3954_1066113:2819-nf] And rising up from thence she went up to Hebron, that is Kirjath-Arba, or the City of the Four Men. These are Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the great Adam whom the Hebrews suppose (from the book of Joshua the son of Nun) to be buried there.[fn-39-P3955_1066373:2820-nf] But many are of opinion that Caleb is the fourth and a monument at one side is pointed out as his. After seeing these places she did not care to go on to Kirjath-sepher, that is \"the village of letters;\" because despising the letter that killeth she had found the spirit that giveth life.[fn-39-P3956_1066686:2821-nf] She admired more the upper springs and the nether springs which Othniel the son of Kenaz the son of Jephunneh received in place of a south land and a waterless possession,[fn-39-P3957_1066943:2822-nf] and by the conducting of which he watered the dry fields of the old covenant. For thus did he typify the redemption which the sinner finds for his old sins in the waters of baptism. On the next day soon after sunrise she stood upon the brow of Capharbarucha,[fn-39-P3958_1067230:2823-nf] that is, \"the house of blessing,\" the point to which Abraham pursued the Lord when he made intercession with Him.[fn-39-P3959_1067365:2824-nf] And here, as she looked down upon the wide solitude and upon the country once belonging to Sodom and Gomorrah, to Admah and Zeboim, she beheld the balsam vines of Engedi and Zoar. By Zoar I mean that \"heifer of three years old\"[fn-39-P3960_1067615:2825-nf] which was formerly called Bela[fn-39-P3961_1067667:2826-nf] and in Syriac is rendered Zoar that is `little.' She called to mind the cave in which Lot found refuge, and with tears in her eyes warned the virgins her companions to beware of \"wine wherein is excess;\"[fn-39-P3962_1067897:2827-nf] for it was to this that the Moabites and Ammonites owe their origin.[fn-39-P3963_1067987:2828-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":15,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1379","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"12. Whilst these things were happening in Jebus[fn-50-P5004_1375933:3574-nf] a dreadful rumour came from the West. Rome had been besieged[fn-50-P5005_1376037:3575-nf] and its citizens had been forced to buy their lives with gold. Then thus despoiled they had been besieged again so as to lose not their substance only but their lives. My voice sticks in my throat; and, as I dictate, sobs choke my utterance. The City which had taken the whole world was itself taken;[fn-50-P5006_1376376:3576-nf] nay more famine was beforehand with the sword and but few citizens were left to be made captives. In their frenzy the starving people had recourse to hideous food; and tore each other limb from limb that they might have flesh to eat. Even the mother did not spare the babe at her breast. In the night was Moab taken, in the night did her wall fall down.[fn-50-P5007_1376759:3577-nf] \"O God, the heathen have come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have made Jerusalem an orchard.[fn-50-P5008_1376906:3578-nf] The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.
