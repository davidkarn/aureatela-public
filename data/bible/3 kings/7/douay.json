{"verses":["And Solomon built his own house in thirteen years, and brought it\nto perfection.","He built also the house of the forest of Libanus; the length of it\nwas a hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty cubits, and the height\nthirty cubits:  and four galleries between pillars of cedar:  for he had\ncut cedar trees into pillars.","And he covered the whole vault with boards of cedar, and it was\nheld up with five and forty pillars.  And one row had fifteen pillars,","Set one against another,","And looking one upon another, with equal space between the\npillars, and over the pillars were square beams in all things equal.","And he made a porch of pillars of fifty cubits in length, and\nthirty cubits in breadth:  and another porch before the greater porch,\nand pillars, and chapiters upon the pillars.","He made also the porch of the throne wherein is the seat of\njudgment; and covered it with cedar wood from the floor to the top.","And in the midst of the porch, was a small house, where he sat in\njudgment of the like work.  He made also a house for the daughter of\nPharao (whom Solomon had taken to wife) of the same work, as this\nporch;","All of costly stones, which were sawed by a certain rule and\nmeasure, both within and without:  from the foundation to the top of the\nwalls, and without, unto the great court.","And the foundations were of costly stones, great stones of ten\ncubits or eight cubits.","And above there were costly stones of equal measure hewed, and in\nlike manner planks of cedar.","And the great court was made round with three rows of hewed\nstones, and one row of planks of cedar, which also was observed in the\ninner court of the house of the Lord, and in the porch of the house.","And king Solomon sent, and brought Hiram from Tyre,","The son of a widow woman, of the tribe of Nephthali, whose father\nwas a Tyrian, an artificer in brass, and full of wisdom, and\nunderstanding, and skill to work all work in brass.  And when he was\ncome to king Solomon, he wrought all his work.","And he cast two pillars in brass, each pillar was eighteen cubits\nhigh:  and a line of twelve cubits compassed both the pillars.","He made also two chapiters of molten brass, to be set upon the\ntops of the pillars:  the height of one chapiter was five cubits, and\nthe height of the other chapiter was five cubits:","And a kind of network, and chain work wreathed together with\nwonderful art.  Both the chapiters of the pillars were cast:  seven rows\nof nets were on one chapiter, and seven nets on the other chapiter.","And he made the pillars, and two rows round about each network to\ncover the chapiters, that were upon the top, with pomegranates:  and in\nlike manner did he to the other chapiter.","And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars, were of\nlily work, in the porch of four cubits.","And again there were other chapiters on the top of the pillars\nabove, according to the measure of the pillar over against the network:\nand of pomegranates there were two hundred, in rows round about the\nother chapiter.","And he set up the two pillars in the porch of the temple:  and\nwhen he had set up the pillar on the right hand, he called the name\nthereof Jachin:  in like manner he set up the second pillar, and called\nthe name thereof Booz.","And upon the tops of the pillars he made lily work:  so the work\nof the pillars was finished.","He made also a molten sea, of ten cubits, from brim to brim,\nround all about; the height of it was five cubits, and a line of thirty\ncubits compassed it round about.","And a graven work, under the brim of it, compassed it for ten\ncubits going about the sea:  there were two rows cast of chamfered\nsculptures.","And it stood upon twelve oxen, of which three looked towards the\nnorth, and three towards the west, and three towards the south, and\nthree towards the east:  and the sea was above upon them, and their\nhinder parts were all hid within.","And the laver was a hand breadth thick:  and the brim thereof was\nlike the brim of a cup, or the leaf of a crisped lily:  it contained two\nthousand bates.","And he made ten bases of brass, every base was four cubits in\nlength, and four cubits in breadth, and three cubits high.","And the work itself of the bases, was intergraven:  and there were\ngravings between the joinings.","And between the little crowns and the ledges, were lions, and\noxen, and cherubims; and in the joinings likewise above:  and under the\nlions and oxen, as it were bands of brass hanging down.","And every base had four wheels, and axletrees of brass:  and at\nthe four sides were undersetters, under the laver molten, looking one\nagainst another.","The mouth also of the laver within, was in the top of the\nchapiter:  and that which appeared without, was of one cubit all round,\nand together it was one cubit and a half:  and in the corners of the\npillars were divers engravings:  and the spaces between the pillars were\nsquare, not round.","And the four wheels, which were at the four corners of the base,\nwere joined one to another under the base:  the height of a wheel was a\ncubit and a half.","And they were such wheels as are used to be made in a chariot:\nand their axletrees, and spokes, and strakes, and naves, were all cast.","And the four undersetters, that were at every corner of each\nbase, were of the base itself, cast and joined together.","And on the top of the base, there was a round compass of half a\ncubit, so wrought that the laver might be set thereon, having its\ngravings, and divers sculptures of itself.","He engraved also in those plates, which were of brass, and in the\ncorners, cherubims, and lions, and palm trees, in likeness of a man\nstanding, so that they seemed not to be engraven, but added round\nabout.","After this manner, he made ten bases, of one casting and measure,\nand the like graving.","He made also ten lavers of brass:  one laver contained four bates,\nand was of four cubits:  and upon every base, in all ten, he put as many\nlavers.","And he set the ten bases, five on the right side of the temple,\nand five on the left:  and the sea he put on the right side of the\ntemple, over against the east southward.","And Hiram made cauldrons, and shovels, and basins, and finished\nall the work of king Solomon in the temple of the Lord.","The two pillars and the two cords of the chapiters, upon the\nchapiters of the pillars:  and the two networks, to cover the two cords,\nthat were upon the top of the pillars.","And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks:  two rows of\npomegranates for each network, to cover the cords of the chapiters,\nwhich were upon the tops of the pillars.","And the ten bases, and the ten lavers on the bases.","And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea.","And the cauldrons, and the shovels, and the basins.  All the\nvessels that Hiram made for king Solomon, for the house of the Lord,\nwere of fine brass.","In the plains of the Jordan, did the king cast them in a clay\nground, between Socoth and Sartham.","And Solomon placed all the vessels:  but for its exceeding great\nmultitude the brass could not be weighed.","And Solomon made all the vessels for the house of the Lord:  the\naltar of gold, and the table of gold, upon which the loaves of\nproposition should be set:","And the golden candlesticks, five on the right hand, and five on\nthe left, over against the oracle, of pure gold:  and the flowers like\nlilies, and the lamps over them of gold:  and golden snuffers,","And pots, and fleshhooks, and bowls, and mortars, and censers, of\nmost pure gold:  and the hinges for the doors of the inner house of the\nholy of holies, and for the doors of the house of the temple, were of\ngold.","And Solomon finished all the work that he made in the house of\nthe Lord, and brought in the things that David, his father, had\ndedicated, the silver and the gold, and the vessels, and laid them up\nin the treasures of the house of the Lord."]}
