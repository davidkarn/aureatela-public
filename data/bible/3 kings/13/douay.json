{"verses":["And behold there came a man of God out of Juda, by the word of\nthe Lord, to Bethel, when Jeroboam was standing upon the altar, and\nburning incense.","And he cried out against the altar in the word of the Lord, and\nsaid:  O altar, altar, thus saith the Lord:  Behold a child shall be born\nto the house of David, Josias by name, and he shall immolate upon thee\nthe priests of the high places, who now burn incense upon thee, and he\nshall burn men's bones upon thee.","And he gave a sign the same day, saying:  This shall be the sign,\nthat the Lord hath spoken:  Behold the altar shall be rent, and the\nashes that are upon it, shall be poured out.","And when the king had heard the word of the man of God, which he\nhad cried out against the altar in Bethel, he stretched forth his hand\nfrom the altar, saying:  Lay hold on him.  And his hand which he\nstretched forth against him, withered:  and he was not able to draw it\nback again to him.","The altar also was rent, and the ashes were poured out from the\naltar, according to the sign which the man of God had given before in\nthe word of the Lord.","And the king said to the man of God:  Entreat the face of the Lord\nthy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me.  And the\nman of God besought the face of the Lord, and the king's hand was\nrestored to him, and it became as it was before.","And the king said to the man of God:  Come home with me to dine,\nand I will make thee presents.","And the man of God answered the king:  If thou wouldst give me\nhalf thy house, I will not go with thee, nor eat bread, nor drink water\nin this place:","For so it was enjoined me by the word of the Lord commanding me:\nThou shalt not eat bread, nor drink water, nor return by the same way\nthat thou camest.","So he departed by another way, and returned not by the way that\nhe came into Bethel.","Now a certain old prophet dwelt in Bethel, and his sons came to\nhim, and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day\nin Bethel:  and they told their father the words which he had spoken to\nthe king.","And their father said to them:  What way went he?  His sons shewed\nhim the way by which the man of God went, who came out of Juda.","And he said to his sons:  Saddle me the ass.  And when they had\nsaddled it, he got up,","And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under a\nturpentine tree:  and he said to him:  Art thou the man of God who camest\nfrom Juda?  He answered:  I am.","And he said to him:  Come home with me to eat bread.","But he said:  I must not return, nor go with thee, neither will I\neat bread, or drink water in this place:","Because the Lord spoke to me, in the word of the Lord, saying:\nThou shalt not eat bread, and thou shalt not drink water there, nor\nreturn by the way thou wentest.","He said to him:  I also am a prophet like unto thee:  and an angel\nspoke to me, in the word of the Lord, saying:  Bring him back with thee\ninto thy house, that he may eat bread, and drink water.  He deceived\nhim,","And brought him back with him:  so he ate bread, and drank water\nin his house.","And as they sat at table, the word of the Lord came to the\nprophet that brought him back:","And he cried out to the man of God who came out of Juda, saying:\nThus saith the Lord:  Because thou hast not been obedient to the Lord,\nand hast not kept the commandment which the Lord thy God commanded\nthee,","And hast returned, and eaten bread, and drunk water in the place\nwherein he commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat bread, nor drink\nwater, thy dead body shall not be brought into the sepulchre of thy\nfathers.","And when he had eaten and drunk, he saddled his ass for the\nprophet, whom he had brought back.","And when he was gone, a lion found him in the way, and killed\nhim, and his body was cast in the way:  and the ass stood by him, and\nthe lion stood by the dead body.","And behold, men passing by, saw the dead body cast in the way,\nand the lion standing by the body.  And they came and told it in the\ncity, wherein that old prophet dwelt.","And when that prophet, who had brought him back out of the way,\nheard of it, he said:  It is the man of God, that was disobedient to the\nmouth of the Lord, and the Lord hath delivered him to the lion, and he\nhath torn him, and killed him, according to the word of the Lord, which\nhe spoke to him.","And he said to his sons:  Saddle me an ass.  And when they had\nsaddled it,","And he was gone, he found the dead body cast in the way, and the\nass and the lion standing by the carcass:  the lion had not eaten of the\ndead body, nor hurt the ass.","And the prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it\nupon the ass, and going back brought it into the city of the old\nprophet, to mourn for him.","And he laid his dead body in his own sepulchre:  and they mourned\nover him, saying:  Alas! alas, my brother.","And when they had mourned over him, he said to his sons:  When I\nam dead, bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried:  lay\nmy bones beside his bones.","For assuredly the word shall come to pass which he hath foretold\nin the word of the Lord, against the altar that is in Bethel:  and\nagainst all the temples of the high places, that are in the cities of\nSamaria.","After these words, Jeroboam came not back from his wicked way:\nbut on the contrary, he made of the meanest of the people priests of\nthe high places:  whosoever would, he filled his hand, and he was made a\npriest of the high places.","And for this cause did the house of Jeroboam sin, and was cut\noff, and destroyed from the face of the earth."]}
