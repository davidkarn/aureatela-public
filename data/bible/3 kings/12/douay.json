{"verses":["And Roboam went to Sichem:  for thither were all Israel come\ntogether to make him king.","But Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who was yet in Egypt, a fugitive\nfrom the face of king Solomon, hearing of his death, returned out of\nEgypt.","And they sent and called him:  and Jeroboam came, and all the\nmultitude of Israel, and they spoke to Roboam, saying:","Thy father laid a grievous yoke upon us:  now, therefore, do thou\ntake off a little of the grievous service of thy father, and of his\nmost heavy yoke, which he put upon us, and we will serve thee.","And he said to them:  Go till the third day, and come to me again.\nAnd when the people was gone,","King Roboam took counsel with the old men, that stood before\nSolomon, his father, while he yet lived, and he said:  What counsel do\nyou give me, that I may answer this people?","They said to him:  If thou wilt yield to this people to day, and\ncondescend to them, and grant their petition, and wilt speak gentle\nwords to them, they will be thy servants always.","But he left the counsel of the old men, which they had given him,\nand consulted with the young men that had been brought up with him, and\nstood before him.","And he said to them:  What counsel do you give me, that I may\nanswer this people, who have said to me:  Make the yoke, which thy\nfather put upon us, lighter?","And the young men that had been brought up with him, said:  Thus\nshalt thou speak to this people, who have spoken to thee, saying:  Thy\nfather made our yoke heavy, do thou ease us.  Thou shalt say to them:  My\nlittle finger is thicker than the back of my father.","And now my father put a heavy yoke upon you, but I will add to\nyour yoke:  my father beat you with whips, but I will beat you with\nscorpions.","So Jeroboam, and all the people, came to Roboam the third day,\nas the king had appointed, saying:  Come to me again the third day.","And the king answered the people roughly, leaving the counsel of\nthe old men, which they had given him,","And he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men,\nsaying:  My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke:  My\nfather beat you with whips, but I will beat you with scorpions.","And the king condescended not to the people:  for the Lord was\nturned away from him, to make good his word, which he had spoken in the\nhand of Ahias, the Silonite, to Jeroboam, the son of Nabat.","Then the people, seeing that the king would not hearken to them,\nanswered him, saying:  What portion have we in David?  or what\ninheritance in the son of Isai?  Go home to thy dwellings, O Israel:\nnow, David, look to thy own house.  So Israel departed to their\ndwellings.","But as for all the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities\nof Juda, Roboam reigned over them.","Then king Roboam sent Aduram, who was over the tribute:  and all\nIsrael stoned him, and he died.  Wherefore king Roboam made haste to get\nhim up into his chariot, and he fled to Jerusalem:","And Israel revolted from the house of David, unto this day.","And it came to pass when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come\nagain, that they gathered an assembly, and sent and called him, and\nmade him king over all Israel, and there was none that followed the\nhouse of David but the tribe of Juda only.","And Roboam came to Jerusalem, and gathered together all the\nhouse of Juda, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred fourscore thousand\nchosen men for war, to fight against the house of Israel, and to bring\nthe kingdom again under Roboam, the son of Solomon.","But the word of the Lord came to Semeias, the man of God,\nsaying:","Speak to Roboam, the son of Solomon, the king of Juda, and to\nall the house of Juda, and Benjamin, and the rest of the people,\nsaying:","Thus saith the Lord:  You shall not go up, nor fight against your\nbrethren, the children of Israel:  let every man return to his house,\nfor this thing is from me.  They hearkened to the word of the Lord, and\nreturned from their journey, as the Lord had commanded them.","And Jeroboam built Sichem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt there, and\ngoing out from thence, he built Phanuel.","And Jeroboam said in his heart:  Now shall the kingdom return to\nthe house of David,","If this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of the\nLord at Jerusalem:  and the heart of this people will turn to their lord\nRoboam, the king of Juda, and they will kill me, and return to him.","And finding out a device, he made two golden calves, and said to\nthem:  Go ye up no more to Jerusalem:  Behold thy gods, O Israel, who\nbrought thee out of the land of Egypt.","And he set the one in Bethel, and the other in Dan:","And this thing became an occasion of sin:  for the people went to\nadore the calf as far as Dan.","And he made temples in the high places, and priests of the\nlowest of the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.","And he appointed a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth\nday of the month, after the manner of the feast that was celebrated in\nJuda.  And going up to the altar, he did in like manner in Bethel, to\nsacrifice to the calves, which he had made:  and he placed in Bethel\npriests of the high places, which he had made.","And he went up to the altar, which he had built in Bethel, on\nthe fifteenth day of the eighth month, which he had devised of his own\nheart:  and he ordained a feast to the children of Israel, and went up\non the altar to burn incense."]}
