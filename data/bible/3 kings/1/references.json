As we have shewn then they are guilty of great extravagance who say that the Lord is not Son of God, but a work, and it follows that we all of necessity confess that He is Son. And if He be Son, as indeed He is, and a son is confessed to be not external to his father but from him, let them not question about the terms, as I said before, which the sacred writers use of the Word Himself, viz. not `to Him that begat Him,' but `to Him that made Him;' for while it is confessed what His nature is, what word is used in such instances need raise no question[fn-58-P5824_2320171:21-nf] .
