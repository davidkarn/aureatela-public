Go, and tell thy master:  Elias is here.","And he said:  What have I sinned, that thou wouldst deliver me,\nthy servant, into the hand of Achab, that he should kill me?","As the Lord thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom,\nwhither my lord hath not sent to seek thee:  and when all answered:  He\nis not here:  he took an oath of every kingdom and nation, because thou\nwast not found.","And now thou sayest to me:  Go and tell thy master:  Elias is\nhere.","And when I am gone from thee, the Spirit of the Lord will carry\nthee into a place that I know not:  and I shall go in and tell Achab;\nand he, not finding thee, will kill me:  but thy servant feareth the\nLord from his infancy.","Hath it not been told thee, my lord, what I did when Jezabel\nkilled the prophets of the Lord; how I hid a hundred men of the\nprophets of the Lord, by fifty and fifty in caves, and fed them with\nbread and water?","And now thou sayest:  Go and tell thy master:  Elias is here:\nthat he may kill me.","And Elias said:  As the Lord of hosts liveth, before whose face I\nstand, this day I will shew myself unto him.","Abdias therefore went to meet Achab, and told him:  and Achab\ncame to meet Elias.","And when he had seen him, he said:  Art thou he that troublest\nIsrael?","And he said:  I have not troubled Israel, but thou and thy\nfather's house, who have forsaken the commandments of the Lord, and\nhave followed Baalim.","Nevertheless send now, and gather unto me all Israel, unto Mount\nCarmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the\nprophets of the groves four hundred, who eat at Jezabel's table.","Achab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered together\nthe prophets unto mount Carmel.","And Elias coming to all the people, said:  How long do you halt\nbetween two sides?  If the Lord be God, follow him:  but if Baal, then\nfollow him.  And the people did not answer him a word.","And Elias said again to the people:  I only remain a prophet of\nthe Lord:  but the prophets of Baal are four hundred and fifty men.","Let two bullocks be given us, and let them choose one bullock\nfor themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it upon wood, but put no\nfire under:  and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and\nput no fire under it.","Call ye on the names of your gods, and I will call on the name\nof my Lord:  and the God that shall answer by fire, let him be God.

But there was no voice, nor any that answered:\nand they leaped over the altar that they had made.","And when it was now noon, Elias jested at them, saying:  Cry with\na louder voice:  for he is a god; and perhaps he is talking, or is in an\ninn, or on a journey; or perhaps he is asleep, and must be awaked.","So they cried with a loud voice, and cut themselves after their\nmanner with knives and lancets, till they were all covered with blood.","And after midday was past, and while they were prophesying, the\ntime was come of offering sacrifice, and there was no voice heard, nor\ndid any one answer, nor regard them as they prayed.","Elias said to all the people:  Come ye unto me.  And the people\ncoming near unto him, he repaired the altar of the Lord, that was\nbroken down:","And he took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes\nof the sons of Jacob to whom the word of the Lord came, saying:  Israel\nshall be thy name.","And he built with the stones an altar to the name of the Lord:\nand he made a trench for water, of the breadth of two furrows, round\nabout the altar.","And he laid the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces,\nand laid it upon the wood.","And he said:  Fill four buckets with water, and pour it upon the\nburnt offering, and upon the wood.

And they did so the third time.","And the water run round about the altar, and the trench was\nfilled with water.","And when it was now time to offer the holocaust, Elias, the\nprophet, came near and said:  O Lord God of Abraham, and Isaac, and\nIsrael, shew this day that thou art the God of Israel, and I thy\nservant, and that according to thy commandment I have done all these\nthings.","Dear me, O Lord, hear me:  that this people may learn that thou\nart the Lord God, and that thou hast turned their heart again.","Then the fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the holocaust, and\nthe wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that\nwas in the trench.","And when all the people saw this, they fell on their faces, and\nthey said:  The Lord, he is God; the Lord, he is God.","And Elias said to them:  Take the prophets of Baal, and let not\none of them escape.

And he said:  Go up, and say to Achab:  Prepare\nthy chariot, and go down, lest the rain prevent thee.","And while he turned himself this way and that way, behold the\nheavens grew dark, with clouds and wind, and there fell a great rain.\nAnd Achab getting up, went away to Jezrahel:","And the hand of the Lord was upon Elias, and he girded up his\nloins, and ran before Achab, till he came to Jezrahel."]}
