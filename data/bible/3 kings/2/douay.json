{"verses":["I am going the way of all flesh:  take thou courage and shew\nthyself a man.","And keep the charge of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and\nobserve his ceremonies, and his precepts, and judgments, and\ntestimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses:  that thou mayst\nunderstand all thou dost, and whithersoever thou shalt turn thyself:","That the Lord may confirm his words, which he hath spoken of me,\nsaying:  If thy children shall take heed to their ways, and shall walk\nbefore me in truth, with all their heart, and with all their soul,\nthere shall not be taken away from thee a man on the throne of Israel.","Thou knowest also what Joab, the son of Sarvia, hath done to me,\nwhat he did to the two captains of the army of Israel, to Abner, the\nson of Ner, and to Amasa, the son of Jether:  whom he slew, and shed the\nblood of war in peace, and put the blood of war on his girdle that was\nabout his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.","Do, therefore, according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoary head\ngo down to hell in peace.","But shew kindness to the sons of Berzellai, the Galaadite, and let\nthem eat at thy table:  for they met me when I fled from the face of\nAbsalom, thy brother.","Thou hast also with thee Semei, the son of Gera, the son of\nJemini, of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse, when I went to\nthe camp:  but because he came down to meet me when I passed over the\nJordan, and I swore to him by the Lord, saying:  I will not kill thee\nwith the sword:","Do not thou hold him guiltless.  But thou art a wise man, and\nknowest what to do with him, and thou shalt bring down his grey hairs\nwith blood to the grave.","So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of\nDavid.","And the days that David reigned in Israel, were forty years:  in\nHebron he reigned seven years, in Jerusalem thirty-three.","And Solomon sat upon the throne of his father David, and his\nkingdom was strengthened exceedingly.","And Adonias, the son of Haggith, came to Bethsabee the mother of\nSolomon.  And she said to him:  Is thy coming peaceable?  He answered:\nIt is peaceable.","And he added:  I have a word to speak with thee.  She said to him:\nSpeak.  And he said:","Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and all Israel had\npreferred me to be their king:  but the kingdom is transferred, and is\nbecome my brother's:  for it was appointed him by the Lord.","Now therefore, I ask one petition of thee; turn not away my face.\nAnd she said to him:  Say on.","And he said I pray thee speak to king Solomon (for he cannot deny\nthee any thing) to give me Abisag, the Sunamitess, to wife.","And Bethsabee said:  Well, I will speak for thee to the king.","Then Bethsabee came to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonias:\nand the king arose to meet her, and bowed to her, and sat down upon his\nthrone:  and a throne was set for the king's mother, and she sat on his\nright hand.","And she said to him:  I desire one small petition of thee; do not\nput me to confusion.  And the king said to her:  My mother ask, for I\nmust not turn away thy face.","And she said:  Let Abisag, the Sunamitess, be given to Adonias,\nthy brother, to wife.","And king Solomon answered, and said to his mother:  Why dost thou\nask Abisag, the Sunamitess, for Adonias?  ask for him also the kingdom;\nfor he is my elder brother, and hath Abiathar, the priest, and Joab,\nthe son of Sarvia.","Then king Solomon swore by the Lord, saying:  So and so may God do\nto me, and add more, if Adonias hath not spoken this word against his\nown life.","And now, as the Lord liveth, who hath established me, and placed\nme upon the throne of David, my father, and who hath made me a house,\nas he promised, Adonias shall be put to death this day.","And king Solomon sent by the hand of Banaias, the son of Joiada,\nwho slew him, and he died.","And the king said also to Abiathar, the priest:  Go to Anathoth,\nto thy lands, for indeed thou art worthy of death:  but I will not at\nthis time put thee to death, because thou didst carry the ark of the\nLord God before David, my father, and hast endured trouble in all the\ntroubles my father endured.","So Solomon cast out Abiathar from being the priest of the Lord,\nthat the word of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he spoke concerning\nthe house of Heli in Silo.","And the news came to Joab, because Joab had turned after Adonias,\nand had not turned after Solomon:  and Joab fled into the tabernacle of\nthe Lord, and took hold on the horn of the altar.","And it was told king Solomon, that Joab was fled into the\ntabernacle of the Lord, and was by the altar:  and Solomon sent Banaias,\nthe son of Joiada, saying.  Go, kill him.","And Banaias came to the tabernacle of the Lord, and said to him:\nThus saith the king:  Come forth.  And he said:  I will not come forth,\nbut here I will die.  Banaias brought word back to the king, saying:\nThus saith Joab, and thus he answered me.","And the king said to him:  Do as he hath said; and kill him, and\nbury him, and thou shalt remove the innocent blood which hath been shed\nby Joab, from me, and from the house of my father:","And the Lord shall return his blood upon his own head; because he\nmurdered two men, just and better than himself:  and slew them with the\nsword, my father, David, not knowing it; Abner, the son of Ner, general\nof the army of Israel, and Amasa, the son of Jether general of the army\nof Juda;","And their blood shall return upon the head of Joab, and upon the\nhead of his seed for ever.  But to David and his seed, and his house,\nand to his throne, be peace for ever from the Lord.","So Banaias, the son of Joiada, went up, and setting upon him slew\nhim, and he was buried in his house in the desert.","And the king appointed Banaias, the son of Joiada in his room\nover the army; and Sadoc, the priest, he put in the place of Abiathar.","The king also sent, and called for Semei, and said to him:  Build\nthee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there:  and go not out from thence\nany where.","For on what day soever thou shalt go out, and shalt pass over the\nbrook Cedron, know that thou shalt be put to death:  thy blood shall be\nupon thy own head.","And Semei said to the king:  The saying is good:  as my lord the\nking hath said, so will thy servant do.  And Semei dwelt in Jerusalem\nmany days.","And it came to pass after three years, that the servants of Semei\nran away to Achis, the son of Maacha, the king of Geth:  and it was told\nSemei that his servants were gone to Geth.","And Semei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Achis, to Geth,\nto seek his servants, and he brought them out of Geth.","And it was told Solomon, that Semei had gone from Jerusalem to\nGeth, and was come back.","And sending he called for him, and said to him:  Did I not protest\nto thee by the Lord, and tell thee before:  On what day soever thou\nshalt go out and walk abroad any where, know that thou shalt die?  And\nthou answeredst me:  The word that I have heard is good.","Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the Lord, and the\ncommandment that I laid upon thee?","And the king said to Semei:  Thou knowest all the evil, of which\nthy heart is conscious, which thou didst to David, my father:  the Lord\nhath returned thy wickedness upon thy own head.","And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall\nbe established before the Lord for ever.","So the king commanded Banaias, the son of Joiada:  and he went out\nand struck him; and he died."]}
