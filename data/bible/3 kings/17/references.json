Thus that widow in the third book of Kings, when in the drought and famine, having consumed everything, she had made of the little meal and oil which was left, a cake upon the ashes, and, having used this, was about to die with her children, Elias came and asked that something should first be given him to eat, and then of what remained that she and her children should eat. Nor did she hesitate to obey; nor did the mother prefer her children to Elias in her hunger and poverty. Yea, there is done in God's sight a thing that pleases God: promptly and liberally is presented what is asked for, Neither is it a portion out of abundance, but the whole out of a little, that is given, and another is fed before her hungry children; nor in penury and want is food thought of before mercy; so that while in a saving work the life according to the flesh is contemned, the soul according to the spirit is preserved. Therefore Elias, being the type of Christ, and showing that according to His mercy He returns to each their reward, answered and said: \"Thus saith the Lord, The vessel of meal shall not fail, and the cruse of oil shall not be diminished, until the day that the Lord giveth rain upon the earth.\"[fn-75-P7545_2516515:51-nf] According to her faith in the divine promise, those things which she gave were multiplied and heaped up to the widow; and her righteous works and deserts of mercy taking augmentations and increase, the vessels of meal and oil were filled. Nor did the mother take away from her children what she gave to Elias, but rather she conferred upon her children what she did kindly and piously.[fn-75-P7546_2516924:52-nf] And she did not as yet know Christ; she had not yet heard His precepts; she did not, as redeemed by His cross and passion, repay meat and drink for His blood.

He forbids their taking anything for their journey, by way of either food or raiment. Who would have given such a commandment as this, but He who feeds the ravens and clothes[fn-60-P6074_1825696:776-nf] the flowers of the field? Who anciently enjoined for the treading ox an unmuzzled mouth,[fn-60-P6075_1825800:777-nf] that he might be at liberty to gather his fodder from his labour, on the principle that the worker is worthy of his hire?[fn-60-P6076_1825946:778-nf] Marcion may expunge such precepts, but no matter, provided the sense of them survives. But when He charges them to shake off the dust of their feet against such as should refuse to receive them, He also bids that this be done as a witness. Now no one bears witness except in a case which is decided by judicial process; and whoever orders inhuman conduct to be submitted to the trial by testimony,[fn-60-P6077_1826366:779-nf] does really threaten as a judge. Again, that it was no new god which recommended[fn-60-P6078_1826477:780-nf] by Christ, was dearly attested by the opinion of all men, because some maintained to Herod that Jesus was the Christ; others, that He was John; some, that He was Elias; and others, that He was one of the old prophetess.[fn-60-P6079_1826714:781-nf] Now, whosoever of all these He might have been, He certainly was not raised up for the purpose of announcing another god after His resurrection. He feeds the multitude in the desert place;[fn-60-P6080_1826925:782-nf] this, you must know[fn-60-P6081_1826968:783-nf] was after the manner of the Old Testament.[fn-60-P6082_1827028:784-nf] Or else,[fn-60-P6083_1827062:785-nf] if there was not the same grandeur, it follows that He is now inferior to the Creator. For He, not for one day, but during forty years, not on the inferior aliment of bread and fish, but with the manna of heaven, supported the lives[fn-60-P6084_1827307:786-nf] of not five thousand, but of six hundred thousand human beings. However, such was the greatness of His miracle, that He willed the slender supply of food, not only to be enough, but even to prove superabundant;[fn-60-P6085_1827537:787-nf] and herein He followed the ancient precedent. For in like manner, during the famine in Elijah's time, the scanty and final meal of the widow of Sarepta was multiplied[fn-60-P6086_1827722:788-nf] by the blessing of the prophet throughout the period of the famine. You have the third book of the Kings.[fn-60-P6087_1827850:789-nf] If you also turn to the fourth book, you will discover all this conduct[fn-60-P6088_1827949:790-nf] of Christ pursued by that man of God, who ordered ten[fn-60-P6089_1828019:791-nf] barley loaves which had been given him to be distributed among the people; and when his servitor, after contrasting the large number of the persons with the small supply of the food, answered, \"What, shall I set this before a hundred men? \"he said again, \"Give them, and they shall eat: for thus saith the Lord, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof, according to the word of the Lord.\"[fn-60-P6090_1828600:792-nf] O Christ, even in Thy novelties Thou art old! Accordingly, when Peter, who had been an eye-witness of the miracle, and had compared it with the ancient precedents, and had discovered in them prophetic intimations of what should one day come to pass, answered (as the mouthpiece of them all) the Lord's inquiry, \"Whom say ye that I am? \"[fn-60-P6091_1828963:793-nf] in the words, \"Thou art the Christ,\" he could not but have perceived that He was that Christ, beside whom he knew of none else in the Scriptures, and whom he was now surveying[fn-60-P6092_1829159:794-nf] in His wonderful deeds. This conclusion He even Himself confirms by thus far bearing with it, nay, even enjoining silence respecting it.[fn-60-P6093_1829315:795-nf] For if Peter was unable to acknowledge Him to be any other than the Creator's Christ, while He commanded them \"to tell no man that saying,\" surely[fn-60-P6094_1829482:796-nf] He was unwilling to have the conclusion promulged which Peter had drawn. No doubt of that,[fn-60-P6095_1829588:797-nf] you say; but as Peter's conclusion was a wrong one, therefore He was unwilling to have a lie disseminated. It was, however, a different reason which He assigned for the silence, even because \"the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and scribes, and priests, and be slain, and be raised again the third day.\"[fn-60-P6096_1829940:798-nf] Now, inasmuch as these sufferings were actually foretold for the Creator's Christ (as we shall fully show in the proper place[fn-60-P6097_1830086:799-nf] ), so by this application of them to His own case[fn-60-P6098_1830172:800-nf] does He prove that it is He Himself of whom they were predicted. At all events, even if they had not been predicted, the reason which He alleged for imposing silence (on the disciples) was such as made it clear enough that Peter had made no mistake, that reason being the necessity of His undergoing these sufferings. \"Whosoever,\" says He, \"will save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.\"[fn-60-P6099_1830638:801-nf] Surely[fn-61-P6100_1830665:802-nf] it is the Son of man[fn-61-P6101_1830700:803-nf] who uttered this sentence. Look carefully, then, along with the king of Babylon, into his burning fiery furnace, and there you will discover one \"like the Son of man\" (for He was not yet really Son of man, because not yet born of man), even as early as then[fn-61-P6102_1831007:804-nf] appointing issues such as these. He saved the lives of the three brethren,[fn-61-P6103_1831099:805-nf] who had agreed to lose them for God's sake; but He destroyed those of the Chaldµans, when they had preferred to save them by the means of their idolatry. Where is that novelty, which you pretend[fn-61-P6104_1831319:806-nf] in a doctrine which possesses these ancient proofs? But all the predictions have been fulfilled[fn-61-P6105_1831428:807-nf] concerning martyrdoms which were to happen, and were to receive the recompenses of their reward from God. \"See,\" says Isaiah, \"how the righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and just men are taken away, and no man considereth.\"[fn-61-P6106_1831692:808-nf] When does this more frequently happen than in the persecution of His saints? This, indeed, is no ordinary matter,[fn-61-P6107_1831827:809-nf] no common casualty of the law of nature; but it is that illustrious devotion, that fighting for the faith, wherein whosoever loses his life for God saves it, so that you may here again recognize the Judge who recompenses the evil gain of life with its destruction, and the good loss thereof with its salvation. It is, however, a jealous God whom He here presents to me one who returns evil for evil. \"For whosoever,\" says He, \"shall be ashamed of me, of him will I also be ashamed.\"[fn-61-P6108_1832497:810-nf] Now to none but my Christ can be assigned the occasion[fn-61-P6109_1832572:811-nf] of such a shame as this. His whole course[fn-61-P6110_1832640:812-nf] was so exposed to shame as to open a way for even the taunts of heretics, declaiming[fn-61-P6111_1832738:813-nf] with all the bitterness in their power against the utter disgrace[fn-61-P6112_1832825:814-nf] of His birth and bringing-up, and the unworthiness of His very flesh.[fn-61-P6113_1832914:815-nf] But how can that Christ of yours be liable to a shame, which it is impossible for him to experience? Since he was never condensed[fn-61-P6114_1833511:816-nf] into human flesh in the womb of a woman, although a virgin; never grew from human seed, although only after the law of corporeal substance, from the fluids[fn-61-P6115_1833699:817-nf] of a woman; was never deemed flesh before shaped in the womb; never called f£tus[fn-61-P6116_1833806:818-nf] after such shaping; was never delivered from a ten months' writhing in the womb;[fn-61-P6117_1834077:819-nf] was never shed forth upon the ground, amidst the sudden pains of parturition, with the unclean issue which flows at such a time through the sewerage of the body, forthwith to inaugurate the light[fn-61-P6118_1834725:820-nf] of life with tears, and with that primal wound which severs the child from her who bears him;[fn-61-P6119_1834860:821-nf] never received the copious ablution, nor the meditation of salt and honey;[fn-61-P6120_1835064:822-nf] nor did he initiate a shroud with swaddling clothes;[fn-61-P6121_1835306:823-nf] nor afterwards did he ever wallow[fn-61-P6122_1835395:824-nf] in his own uncleanness, in his mother's lap; nibbling at her breast; long an infant; gradually[fn-61-P6123_1835524:825-nf] a boy; by slow degrees[fn-61-P6124_1835559:826-nf] a man.[fn-61-P6125_1835580:827-nf] But he was revealed[fn-61-P6126_1835618:828-nf] from heaven, full-grown at once, at once complete; immediately Christ; simply spirit, and power, and god. But as withal he was not true, because not visible; therefore he was no object to be ashamed of from the curse of the cross, the real endurance[fn-61-P6127_1835924:829-nf] of which he escaped, because wanting in bodily substance. Never, therefore, could he have said, \"Whosoever shall be ashamed of me.\" But as for our Christ, He could do no otherwise than make such a declaration;[fn-61-P6128_1836151:830-nf] \"made\" by the Father \"a little lower than the angels,\"[fn-61-P6129_1836234:831-nf] \"a worm and no man, a reproach of men, and despised of the people; \"[fn-61-P6130_1836323:832-nf] seeing that it was His will that \"with His stripes we should be healed,\"[fn-61-P6131_1836416:833-nf] that by His humiliation our salvation should be established. And justly did He humble Himself[fn-61-P6132_1836531:834-nf] for His own creature man, for the image and likeness of Himself, and not of another, in order that man, since he had not felt ashamed when bowing down to a stone or a stock, might with similar courage give satisfaction to God for the shamelessness of his idolatry, by displaying an equal degree of shamelessness in his faith, in not being ashamed of Christ. Now, Marcion, which of these courses is better suited to your Christ, in respect of a meritorious shame?[fn-61-P6133_1837014:835-nf] Plainly, you ought yourself to blush with shame for having given him a fictitious existence.[fn-61-P6134_1837138:836-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":17,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_25_book_iii_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"56","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"30.

I do not think it would be proper to pass by this either: for we shall both pay the meed of honour which is due to her, if to anyone at all, and gratify him, by her being associated with him in our recital. She, who had always been strong and vigorous and free from disease all her life, was herself attacked by sickness. In consequence of much distress, not to prolong my story, caused above all by inability to eat, her life was for many days in danger, and no remedy for the disease could be found. How did God sustain her? Not by raining down manna, as for Israel of old[fn-39-P3982_1169414:69-nf] or opening the rock, in order to give drink to His thirsting people,[fn-39-P3983_1169508:70-nf] or feasting her by means of ravens, as Elijah,[fn-39-P3984_1169577:71-nf] or feeding her by a prophet carried through the air, as He did to Daniel when a-hungered in the den.[fn-39-P3985_1169724:72-nf] But how?

The nocturnal vision was a real action. For, in consequence, she became more herself and of better hope, as is manifest by a clear and evident token.

And that ye may know that it is this perfect charity which that man violates not, and against which that man sins not, who is born of God; this is what the Lord saith to Peter; \"Peter lovest thou me?\" And he answers, \"I love.\" He saith not, If thou love me, shew kindness to me. For when the Lord was in mortal flesh, He hungered, He thirsted: at that time when He hungered and thirsted, He was taken in as a guest; those who had the means, ministered unto Him of their substance, as we read in the Gospel. Zacchaeus entertained Him as his guest: he was saved from his disease by entertaining the Physician. From what disease? The disease of avarice. For he was very rich, and the chief of the publicans. Mark the man made whole from the disease of avarice: \"The half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man, I will restore him fourfold.\"[fn-43-P4301_2335235:18-nf] That he kept the other half, was not to enjoy it, but to pay his debts. Well, he at that time entertained the Physician as his guest, because there was infirmity of the flesh in the Lord, to which men might show this kindness; and this, because it was His will to grant this very thing to them that did Him kind service; for the benefit was to them that did the service, not to Him. For, could He to whom angels ministered require these men's kindness? Not even His servant Elias, to whom He sent bread and flesh by the ravens upon a certain occasion[fn-43-P4302_2335804:19-nf] had need of this; and yet that a religious widow might be blessed, the servant of God is sent, and he whom God in secret did feed, is fed by the widow. But still, although by the means of these servants of God, those who consider their need get good to themselves, in respect of that reward most manifestly set forth by the Lord in the Gospel: \"He that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward: and he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward: and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, He shall in no wise lose his reward:\"[fn-43-P4303_2336546:20-nf] although, then, they that do this, do it to their own good: yet neither could this kind office be done to Him when about to ascend[fn-43-P4304_2336699:21-nf] into Heaven. What could Peter, who loved Him, render unto Him? Hear what. \"Feed my sheep:\" i.e. do for the brethren, that which I have done for thee.

And if we must also look at ancient history, I perceive that Enoch,[fn-53-P5372_1790432:19-nf] the seventh among our ancestors, was honoured by translation. I perceive also that the twenty-first, Abraham,[fn-53-P5373_1790556:20-nf] was given the glory of the Patriarchate, by the addition of a greater mystery. For the Hebdomad thrice repeated brings out this number. And one who is very bold might venture even to come to the New Adam, my God and Lord Jesus Christ, Who is counted the Seventy-seventh from the old Adam who fell under sin, in the backward genealogy according to Luke.[fn-53-P5374_1790926:21-nf] And I think of the seven trumpets of Jesus, the son of Nave, and the same number of circuits and days and priests, by which the walls of Jericho were shaken down.[fn-53-P5375_1791108:22-nf] And so too the seven compassings of the City; in the same way as there is a mystery in the threefold breathings of Elias, the Prophet, by which he breathed life into the son of the Sareptan widow,[fn-53-P5376_1791327:23-nf] and the same number of his floodings of the wood,[fn-53-P5377_1791399:24-nf] when he consumed the sacrifice with fire sent from God, and condemned the prophets of shame who could not do the like at his challenge. And the sevenfold looking for the cloud imposed upon the young servant; and Elissaaeus stretching himself that number of times upon the child of the Shunammite, by which stretching the breath of life was restored.[fn-53-P5378_1791769:25-nf] To the same doctrine belongs, I think (if I may omit the seven-stemmed and seven-lamped candlestick of the Temple[fn-53-P5379_1792250:26-nf] ) that the ceremony of the Priests' consecration lasted seven days;[fn-53-P5380_1792340:27-nf] and seven that of the purifying of a leper,[fn-53-P5381_1792406:28-nf] and that of the Dedication of the Temple[fn-53-P5382_1792464:29-nf] the same number, and that in the seventieth year the people returned from the Captivity;[fn-53-P5383_1792575:30-nf] that whatever is in Units may appear also in Decads, and the mystery of the Hebdomad be reverenced in a more perfect number.

And the leavings after they were satisfied were in the first case twelve baskets full, and in the other seven baskets;[fn-53-P5384_1793026:31-nf] neither, I imagine, without a reason or unworthy of the Spirit. And if you read for yourself you may take note of many numbers which contain a meaning deeper than appears on the surface. But to come to an instance which is most useful to us on the present occasion, not that for these reasons or others very similar or yet more divine, the Hebrews honour the Day of Pentecost, m@d we also honour it; just as there are other rites of the Hebrews which we observe ... they were typically observed by them, and by us they are sacramentally reinstated.

Thus then was the Lord received as a guest, \"who came unto His own, and His own received Him not: but as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God:\"[fn-53-P5319_2259961:4-nf] adopting servants, and making them brethren; redeeming captives, and making them co-heirs. Yet let none of you, as perhaps may be the case, say, \"O blessed they who obtained the grace[fn-53-P5320_2260164:5-nf] to receive Christ into their own house!\" Do not grieve, do not murmur, that thou wert born in times when thou seest the Lord no more in the flesh; He has not taken this blessedness from thee. \"Forasmuch,\" says He, \"as ye have done it unto the least of Mine, ye have done unto Me.\"[fn-53-P5321_2260459:6-nf] ","title":"Sermon LIII.

For we shall be rightly attacked with rebukes, and through our fault ungodly tongues will arm themselves to do harm to religion, if the conduct of those that fast is at variance with the standard of perfect purity. For our fast does not consist chiefly of mere abstinence from food, nor are dainties withdrawn from our bodily appetites with profit, unless the mind is recalled from wrong-doing and the tongue restrained from slandering. This is a time of gentleness and long-suffering, of peace and tranquillity: when all the pollutions of vice are to be eradicated and continuance of virtue is to be attained by us. Now let godly minds boldly accustom themselves to forgive faults, to pass over insults, and to forget wrongs. Now let the faithful spirit train himself with the armour of righteousness on the fight hand and on the left, that through honour and dishonour, through ill repute and good repute, the conscience may be undisturbed in unwavering uprightness, not puffed up by praise and not wearied out by revilings. The self-restraint of the religious should not be gloomy, but sincere; no murmurs of complaint should be heard from those who are never without the consolation of holy joys. The decrease of worldly means should not be feared in the practice of works of mercy. Christian poverty is always rich, because what it has is more than what it has not. Nor does the poor man fear to labour in this world, to whom it is given to possess all things in the Lord of all things. Therefore those who do the things which are good must have no manner of fear lest the power of doing should fail them; since in the gospel the widow's devotion is extolled in the case of her two mites, and voluntary bounty gets its reward for a cup of cold water[fn-34-P3406_842503:3-nf] . For the measure of our charitableness is fixed by the sincerity of our feelings, and he that shows mercy on others will never want for mercy himself. The holy widow of Sarepta discovered this, who offered the blessed Elias in the time of famine one day's food, which was all she had, and putting the prophet's hunger before her own needs, ungrudgingly gave up a handful of corn and a little oil[fn-34-P3407_842975:4-nf] . But she did not lose what she gave in all faith, and in the vessels emptied by her godly bounty a source of new plenty arose, that the fulness of her substance might not be diminished by the holy purpose to which she had put it, because she had never dreaded being brought to want.","title":"Sermon XLII.

But what is meant when, after saying, \"If I had not done among them works,\" He immediately added, \"which none other man did\"? Of a certainty, among all the works of Christ, none seem to be greater than the raising of the dead; and yet we know that the same was done by the prophets of olden time.
