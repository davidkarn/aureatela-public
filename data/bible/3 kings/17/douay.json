{"verses":["And Elias the Thesbite, of the inhabitants of Galaad, said to\nAchab:  As the Lord liveth, the God of Israel, in whose sight I stand,\nthere shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to the words\nof my mouth.","And the word of the Lord came to him, saying:","Get thee hence, and go towards the east, and hide thyself by the\ntorrent of Carith, which is over against the Jordan;","And there thou shalt drink of the torrent:  and I have commanded\nthe ravens to feed thee there.","So he went, and did according to the word of the Lord:  and going,\nhe dwelt by the torrent Carith, which is over against the Jordan.","And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and\nbread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the torrent.","But after some time the torrent was dried up:  for it had not\nrained upon the earth.","Then the word of the Lord came to him, saying:","Arise, and go to Sarephta of the Sidonians, and dwell there:  for\nI have commanded a widow woman there to feed thee.","He arose, and went to Sarephta.  And when he was come to the gate\nof the city, he saw the widow woman gathering sticks, and he called\nher, and said to her:  Give me a little water in a vessel, that I may\ndrink.","And when she was going to fetch it, he called after her, saying:\nBring me also, I beseech thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand.","And she answered:  As the Lord thy God liveth, I have no bread,\nbut only a handful of meal in a pot, and a little oil in a cruise:\nbehold I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it, for me\nand my son, that we may eat it and die.","And Elias said to her:  Fear not; but go, and do as thou hast\nsaid but first make for me of the same meal a little hearth cake, and\nbring it to me, and after make for thyself and thy son.","For thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel:  The pot of meal\nshall not waste, nor the cruise of oil be diminished, until the day\nwherein the Lord will give rain upon the face of the earth.","She went, and did according to the word of Elias:  and he ate,\nand she, and her house:  and from that day","The pot of meal wasted not, and the cruise of oil was not\ndiminished according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke in the\nhand of Elias.","And it came to pass after this, that the son of the woman, the\nmistress of the house, fell sick, and the sickness was very grievous,\nso that there was no breath left in him.","And she said to Elias:  What have I to do with thee, thou man of\nGod?  art thou come to me, that my iniquities should be remembered, and\nthat thou shouldst kill my son?","And Elias said to her:  Give me thy son.  And he took him out of\nher bosom, and carried him into the upper chamber where he abode, and\nlaid him upon his own bed.","And he cried to the Lord, and said:  O Lord, my God, hast thou\nafflicted also the widow, with whom I am after a sort maintained, so as\nto kill her son?","And he stretched, and measured himself upon the child three\ntimes, and cried to the Lord, and said:  O Lord, my God, let the soul of\nthis child, I beseech thee, return into his body.","And the Lord heard the voice of Elias:  and the soul of the child\nreturned into him, and he revived.","And Elias took the child, and brought him down from the upper\nchamber to the house below, and delivered him to his mother, and said\nto her:  Behold thy son liveth.","And the woman said to Elias:  Now by this I know that thou art a\nman of God, and the word of the Lord in thy mouth is true."]}
