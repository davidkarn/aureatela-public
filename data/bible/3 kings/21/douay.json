{"verses":["And after these things, Naboth the Jezrahelite, who was in\nJezrahel, had at that time a vineyard, near the palace of Achab, king\nof Samaria.","And Achab spoke to Naboth, saying:  Give me thy vineyard, that I\nmay make me a garden of herbs, because it is nigh, and adjoining to my\nhouse; and I will give thee for it a better vineyard:  or if thou think\nit more convenient for thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.","Naboth answered him:  The Lord be merciful to me, and not let me\ngive thee the inheritance of my fathers.","And Achab came into his house angry and fretting, because of the\nword that Naboth, the Jezrahelite, had spoken to him, saying:  I will\nnot give thee the inheritance of my fathers.  And casting himself upon\nhis bed, he turned away his face to the wall, and would eat no bread.","And Jezabel, his wife, went in to him, and said to him:  What is\nthe matter that thy soul is so grieved?  and why eatest thou no bread?","And he answered her:  I spoke to Naboth, the Jezrahelite, and said\nto him:  Give me thy vineyard, and take money for it:  or if it please\nthee, I will give thee a better vineyard for it.  And he said:  I will\nnot give thee my vineyard.","Then Jezabel, his wife, said to him.  Thou art of great authority\nindeed, and governest well the kingdom of Israel.  Arise, and eat bread,\nand be of good cheer; I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth, the\nJezrahelite.","So she wrote letters in Achab's name, and sealed them with his\nring, and sent them to the ancients, and the chief men that were in his\ncity, and that dwelt with Naboth.","And this was the tenor of the letters:  Proclaim a fast, and make\nNaboth sit among the chief of the people;","And suborn two men, sons of Belial, against him.  and let them\nbear false witness; that he hath blasphemed God and the king:  and then\ncarry him out, and stone him, and so let him die.","And the men of his city, the ancients and nobles, that dwelt\nwith him in the city, did as Jezabel had commanded them, and as it was\nwritten in the letters which she had sent to them;","They proclaimed a fast, and made Naboth sit among the chief of\nthe people.","And bringing two men, sons of the devil, they made them sit\nagainst him:  and they, like men of the devil, bore witness against him\nbefore the people:  saying:  Naboth hath blasphemed God and the king.\nWherefore they brought him forth without the city, and stoned him to\ndeath.","And they sent to Jezabel, saying:  Naboth is stoned, and is dead.","And it came to pass, when Jezabel heard that Naboth was stoned,\nand dead, that she said to Achab:  Arise, and take possession of the\nvineyard of Naboth, the Jezrahelite, who would not agree with thee, and\ngive it thee for money:  for Naboth is not alive, but dead.","And when Achab heard this, to wit, that Naboth was dead, he\narose, and went down into the vineyard of Naboth, the Jezrahelite, to\ntake possession of it.","And the word of the Lord came to Elias, the Thesbite, saying:","Arise, and go down to meet Achab, king of Israel, who is in\nSamaria:  behold he is going down to the vineyard of Naboth, to take\npossession of it:","And thou shalt speak to him, saying:  Thus saith the Lord:  Thou\nhast slain:  moreover also thou hast taken possession.  And after these\nwords thou shalt add:  Thus saith the Lord:  In this place, wherein the\ndogs have licked the blood of Naboth, they shall lick thy blood also.","And Achab said to Elias:  Hast thou found me thy enemy?  He said:\nI have found thee because thou art sold, to do evil in the sight of the\nLord.","Behold I will bring evil upon thee, and I will cut down thy\nposterity, and I will kill of Achab him that pisseth against the wall,\nand him that is shut up, and the last in Israel.","And I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of\nNabat, and like the house of Baasa the son of Ahias:  for what thou hast\ndone to provoke me to anger, and for making Israel to sin.","And of Jezabel also, the Lord spoke, saying:  The dogs shall eat\nJezabel in the field of Jezrahel.","If Achab die in the city, the dogs shall eat him:  but if he die\nin the field, the birds of the air shall eat him.","Now, there was not such another as Achab, who was sold to do\nevil in the sight of the Lord:  for his wife, Jezabel, set him on,","And he became abominable, insomuch that he followed the idols\nwhich the Amorrhites had made, whom the Lord destroyed before the face\nof the children of Israel.","And when Achab had heard these words, he rent his garments, and\nput haircloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and slept in sackcloth, and\nwalked with his head cast down.","And the word of the Lord came to Elias, the Thesbite, saying:","Hast thou not seen Achab humbled before me?  therefore, because\nhe hath humbled himself, for my sake, I will not bring the evil in his\ndays, but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house."]}
