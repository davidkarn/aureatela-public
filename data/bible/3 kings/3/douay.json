{"verses":["And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon, and he\nmade affinity with Pharao, the king of Egypt:  for he took his daughter,\nand brought her into the city of David:  until he had made an end of\nbuilding his own house, and the house of the Lord, and the wall of\nJerusalem round about.","But yet the people sacrificed in the high places:  for there was no\ntemple built to the name of the Lord until that day.","And Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the precepts of David, his\nfather; only he sacrificed in the high places, and burnt incense.","He went therefore to Gabaon, to sacrifice there:  for that was the\ngreat high place:  a thousand victims for holocausts, did Solomon offer\nupon that altar, in Gabaon.","And the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, saying:  Ask\nwhat thou wilt that I should give thee.","And Solomon said:  Thou hast shewed great mercy to thy servant\nDavid, my father, even as he walked before thee in truth, and justice,\nand an upright heart with thee:  and thou hast kept thy great mercy for\nhim, and hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.","And now, O Lord God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of\nDavid, my father:  and I am but a child, and know not how to go out and\ncome in;","And thy servant is in the midst of the people which thou hast\nchosen, an immense people, which cannot be numbered nor counted for\nmultitude.","Give therefore to thy servant an understanding heart, to judge thy\npeople, and discern between good and evil.  For who shall be able to\njudge this people, thy people, which is so numerous?","And the word was pleasing to the Lord, that Solomon had asked\nsuch a thing.","And the Lord said to Solomon:  Because thou hast asked this thing,\nand hast not asked for thyself long life nor riches, nor the lives of\nthy enemies, but hast asked for thyself wisdom to discern judgment;","Behold I have done for thee according to thy words, and have\ngiven thee a wise and understanding heart, in so much that there hath\nbeen no one like thee before thee, nor shall arise after thee.","Yea, and the things also which thou didst not ask, I have given\nthee; to wit, riches and glory:  so that no one hath been like thee\namong the kings in all days heretofore.","And if thou wilt walk in my ways, and keep my precepts and my\ncommandments, as thy father walked, I will lengthen thy days.","And Solomon awaked, and perceived that it was a dream:  and when\nhe was come to Jerusalem, he stood before the ark of the covenant of\nthe Lord, and offered holocausts, and sacrificed victims of peace\nofferings, and made a great feast for all his servants.","Then there came two women that were harlots, to the king, and\nstood before him.","And one of them said:  I beseech thee, my lord, I and this woman\ndwelt in one house, and I was delivered of a child with her in the\nchamber.","And the third day after I was delivered, she also was delivered;\nand we were together, and no other person with us in the house; only we\ntwo.","And this woman's child died in the night:  for in her sleep she\noverlaid him.","And rising in the dead time of the night, she took my child from\nmy side, while I, thy handmaid, was asleep, and laid it in her bosom:\nand laid her dead child in my bosom.","And when I arose in the morning, to give my child suck, behold it\nwas dead:  but considering him more diligently, when it was clear day, I\nfound that it was not mine which I bore.","And the other woman answered:  It is not so as thou sayest, but\nthy child is dead, and mine is alive.  On the contrary, she said; Thou\nliest:  for my child liveth, and thy child is dead.  And in this manner\nthey strove before the king.","Then said the king:  The one saith, My child is alive, and thy\nchild is dead.  And the other answereth:  Nay; but thy child is dead, and\nmine liveth.","The king therefore said:  Bring me a sword.  And when they had\nbrought a sword before the king,","Divide, said he, the living child in two, and give half to the\none and half to the other.","But the woman, whose child was alive, said to the king; (for her\nbowels were moved upon her child) I beseech thee, my lord, give her the\nchild alive, and do not kill it.  But the other said:  Let it be neither\nmine nor thine; but divide it.","The king answered, and said:  Give the living child to this woman,\nand let it not be killed; for she is the mother thereof.","And all Israel heard the judgment which the king had judged, and\nthey feared the king, seeing that the wisdom of God was in him to do\njudgment."]}
