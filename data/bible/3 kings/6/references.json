And he says not, Ye proselytes, since it was a term of disadvantage.[fn-11-P1158_1105191:2-nf] \"The God of this people chose our fathers: and the people\"-See, he calls God Himself their God peculiarly, Who is the common God of men; and shows how great from the first were His benefits, just as Stephen does. This they do to teach them, that now also God has acted after the same custom, in sending His own Son; (Luke xx. 13): as (Christ) Himself (does) in the parable of the vineyard-\"And the people,\" he says, \"He exalted when it sojourned in the land of Egypt\"-and yet the contrary was the case:[fn-11-P1159_1105829:3-nf] true, but they increased in numbers; moreover, the miracles were wrought on their account: \"and with an high arm brought He them out of it.\" Of these things (the wonders) which were done in Egypt, the prophets are continually making mention. And observe, how he passes over the times of their calamities, and nowhere brings forward their faults, but only God's kindness, leaving those for themselves to think over. \"And about the time of forty years suffered He their manners in the wilderness.\" (v. 18.) Then the settlement. \"And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, He divided their land to them by lot.\" (v. 19.) And the time was long; four hundred and fifty years. \"And after that He gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.\"[fn-11-P1160_1107314:4-nf] (v. 20.) Here he shows that God varied His dispensations towards them (at divers times). \"And afterward they desired a king:\" and (still) not a word of their ingratitude, but throughout he speaks of the kindness of God. \"And God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years.\" (v. 21.) \"And when he had removed him, He raised up unto them David to be their king: to whom also He gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after Mine own heart, which shall fulfil all My will. Of this man's seed hath God according to His promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus.\" (v. 22, 23.) This was no small thing that Christ should be from David. Then John bears witness to this: \"When John had first preached before His coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not He. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of His feet I am not worthy to loose.\" (v. 24, 25.) And John too not merely bears witness (to the fact), but (does it in such sort that) when men were bringing the glory to him, he declines it: for it is one thing (not to affect) an honor which nobody thinks of offering; and another, to reject it when all men are ready to give it, and not only to reject it, but to do so with such humility. \"Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent. For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew Him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning Him. And though they found no cause of death in Him, yet desired they Pilate that He should be slain.\" (v. 26-28.) On all occasions we find them making a great point of showing this, that the blessing is peculiarly theirs, that they may not flee (from Christ), as thinking they had nothing to do with Him, because they had crucified Him. \"Because they knew Him not,\" he says: so that the sin was one of ignorance. See how he gently makes an apology even on behalf of those (crucifiers). And not only this: but he adds also, that thus it must needs be. And[fn-11-P1161_1110919:5-nf] how so? \"By condemning Him, they fulfilled the voices of the prophets.\" Then again from the Scriptures. \"And when they had fulfilled all that was written of Him, they took Him down from the tree, and laid Him in a sepulchre. But God raised Him from the dead. And He was seen many days of them which came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are His witnesses unto the people-\" (v. 29-31) that He rose again. \"And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers, God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that He hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second Psalm, Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee. And as concerning that He raised Him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, He said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David. Wherefore he saith also in another Psalm, Thou shall not suffer Thine Holy One to see corruption. For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption: but He, Whom God raised again, saw no corruption. Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this Man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: and by Him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.\" (v. 32-39.) Observe[fn-11-P1162_1112757:6-nf] how Paul here is more vehement in his discourse: we nowhere find Peter saying this. Then too he adds the terrifying words: \"Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets; Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you.\" (v. 40, 41.)","title":"Homily XXIX.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"}]
