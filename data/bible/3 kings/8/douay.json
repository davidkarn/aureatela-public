{"verses":["Then all the ancients of Israel, with the princes of the tribes,\nand the heads of the families of the children of Israel, were assembled\nto king Solomon, in Jerusalem:  that they might carry the ark of the\ncovenant of the Lord, out of the city of David, that is, out of Sion.","And all Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon, on the\nfestival day, in the month of Ethanim, the same is the seventh month.","And all the ancients of Israel came, and the priests took up the\nark,","And carried the ark of the Lord, and the tabernacle of the\ncovenant, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, that were in the\ntabernacle:  and the priests and the Levites carried them.","And king Solomon, and all the multitude of Israel, that were\nassembled unto him, went with him before the ark, and they sacrificed\nsheep and oxen, that could not be counted or numbered.","And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord\ninto its place, into the oracle of the temple, into the holy of holies,\nunder the wings of the cherubims.","For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the\nark, and covered the ark, and the staves thereof above.","And whereas the staves stood out, the ends of them were seen\nwithout, in the sanctuary before the oracle, but were not seen farther\nout, and there they have been unto this day.","Now in the ark there was nothing else but the two tables of stone,\nwhich Moses put there at Horeb, when the Lord made a covenant with the\nchildren of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.","And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the\nsanctuary, that a cloud filled the house of the Lord,","And the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud:\nfor the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord.","Then Solomon said:  The Lord said that he would dwell in a cloud.","Building, I have built a house for thy dwelling, to be thy most\nfirm throne for ever.","And the king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of\nIsrael:  for all the assembly of Israel stood.","And Solomon said:  Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, who\nspoke with his mouth to David, my father, and with his own hands hath\naccomplished it, saying:","Since the day that I brought my people Israel, out of Egypt, I\nchose no city out of all the tribes of Israel, for a house to be built,\nthat my name might be there:  but I chose David to be over my people\nIsrael.","And David, my father, would have built a house to the name of the\nLord, the God of Israel:","And the Lord said to David, my father:  Whereas, thou hast thought\nin thy heart to build a house to my name, thou hast done well in having\nthis same thing in thy mind.","Nevertheless, thou shalt not build me a house, but thy son, that\nshall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build a house to my name.","The Lord hath performed his word which he spoke.  And I stand in\nthe room of David, my father, and sit upon the throne of Israel, as the\nLord promised:  and have built a house to the name of the Lord, the God\nof Israel.","And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant\nof the Lord, which he made with our fathers, when they came out of the\nland of Egypt.","And Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord, in the sight of\nthe assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands towards heaven,","And said:  Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in\nheaven above, or on the earth beneath:  who keepest covenant and mercy\nwith thy servants, that have walked before thee with all their heart:","Who hast kept with thy servant David, my father, what thou hast\npromised him:  with thy mouth thou didst speak, and with thy hands thou\nhast performed, as this day proveth.","Now, therefore, O Lord God of Israel, keep with thy servant\nDavid, my father, what thou hast spoken to him, saying:  There shall not\nbe taken away of thee a man in my sight, to sit on the throne of\nIsrael:  yet so that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk\nbefore me as thou hast walked in my sight.","And now, Lord God of Israel, let thy words be established, which\nthou hast spoken to thy servant David, my father.","Is it then to be thought that God should indeed dwell upon earth?\nfor if heaven, and the heavens of heavens, cannot contain thee, how\nmuch less this house which I have built?","But have regard to the prayer of thy servant, and to his\nsupplications, O Lord, my God:  hear the hymn and the prayer, which thy\nservant prayeth before thee this day:","That thy eyes may be open upon this house, night and day:  upon\nthe house of which thou hast said:  My name shall be there:  that thou\nmayst hearken to the prayer which thy servant prayeth, in this place to\nthee:","That thou mayst hearken to the supplication of thy servant, and\nof thy people Israel, whatsoever they shall pray for in this place, and\nhear them in the place of thy dwelling in heaven; and when thou\nhearest, shew them mercy.","If any man trespass against his neighbour, and have an oath upon\nhim, wherewith he is bound, and come, because of the oath, before thy\naltar, to thy house,","Then hear thou in heaven:  and do and judge thy servants,\ncondemning the wicked, and bringing his way upon his own head, and\njustifying the just, and rewarding him according to his justice.","If thy people Israel shall fly before their enemies (because they\nwill sin against thee) and doing penance, and confessing to thy name,\nshall come and pray, and make supplications to thee in this house:","Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people\nIsrael, and bring them back to the land which thou gavest to their\nfathers.","If heaven shall be shut up, and there shall be no rain, because\nof their sins, and they, praying in this place, shall do penance to thy\nname, and shall be converted from their sins, by occasion of their\nafflictions:","Then hear thou them in heaven, and forgive the sins of thy\nservants, and of thy people Israel:  and shew them the good way wherein\nthey should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to\nthy people in possession.","If a famine arise in the land, or a pestilence, or corrupt air,\nor blasting, or locust, or mildew; if their enemy afflict them,\nbesieging the gates, whatsoever plague, whatsoever infirmity,","Whatsoever curse or imprecation shall happen to any man of thy\npeople Israel:  when a man shall know the wound of his own heart, and\nshall spread forth his hands in this house;","Then hear thou in heaven, in the place of thy dwelling, and\nforgive, and do so as to give to every one according to his ways, as\nthou shalt see his heart (for thou only knowest the heart of all the\nchildren of men)","That they may fear thee all the days that they live upon the face\nof the land, which thou hast given to our fathers.","Moreover also the stranger, who is not of thy people Israel, when\nhe shall come out of a far country for thy name's sake, (for they shall\nhear every where of thy great name, and thy mighty hand,","And thy stretched out arm) so when he shall come, and shall pray\nin this place,","Then hear thou in heaven, in the firmament of thy dwelling place,\nand do all those things, for which that stranger shall call upon thee:\nthat all the people of the earth may learn to fear thy name, as do thy\npeople Israel, and may prove that thy name is called upon on this\nhouse, which I have built.","If thy people go out to war against their enemies, by what way\nsoever thou shalt send them, they shall pray to thee towards the way of\nthe city, which thou hast chosen, and towards the house, which I have\nbuilt to thy name:","And then hear thou in heaven their prayers, and their\nsupplications, and do judgment for them.","But if they sin against thee, (for there is no man who sinneth\nnot) and thou being angry, deliver them up to their enemies, so that\nthey be led away captives into the land of their enemies, far or near;","Then if they do penance in their heart, in the place of\ncaptivity, and being converted, make supplication to thee in their\ncaptivity, saying:  We have sinned, we have done unjustly, we have\ncommitted wickedness:","And return to thee with all their heart, and all their soul, in\nthe land of their enemies, to which they have been led captives:  and\npray to thee towards the way of their land, which thou gavest to their\nfathers, and of the city which thou hast chosen, and of the temple\nwhich I have built to thy name:","Then hear thou in heaven, in the firmament of thy throne, their\nprayers, and their supplications, and do judgment for them:","And forgive thy people, that have sinned against thee, and all\ntheir iniquities, by which they have transgressed against thee:  and\ngive them mercy before them that have made them captives, that they may\nhave compassion on them.","For they are thy people, and thy inheritance, whom thou hast\nbrought out of the land of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of\niron.","That thy eyes may be open to the supplication of thy servant, and\nof thy people Israel, to hear them in all things for which they shall\ncall upon thee.","For thou hast separated them to thyself for an inheritance, from\namongst all the people of the earth, as thou hast spoken by Moses, thy\nservant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord God.","And it came to pass, when Solomon had made an end of praying all\nthis prayer and supplication to the Lord, that he rose from before the\naltar of the Lord:  for he had fixed both knees on the ground, and had\nspread his hands towards heaven.","And he stood, and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud\nvoice, saying:","Blessed be the Lord, who hath given rest to his people Israel,\naccording to all that he promised:  there hath not failed so much as one\nword of all the good things that he promised by his servant Moses.","The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our fathers, and not\nleave us, nor cast us off:","But may he incline our hearts to himself, that we may walk in all\nhis ways, and keep his commandments, and his ceremonies, and all his\njudgments, which he commanded our fathers.","And let these my words, wherewith I have prayed before the Lord,\nbe nigh unto the Lord our God day and night, that he may do judgment\nfor his servant, and for his people Israel, day by day:","That all the people of the earth may know, that the Lord he is\nGod, and there is no other besides him.","Let our hearts also be perfect with the Lord our God, that we may\nwalk in his statutes, and keep his commandments, as at this day.","And the king, and all Israel with him, offered victims before the\nLord.","And Solomon slew victims of peace offerings, which he sacrificed\nto the Lord, two and twenty thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty\nthousand sheep so the king, and all the children of Israel, dedicated\nthe temple of the Lord.","In that day the king sanctified the middle of the court, that was\nbefore the house of the Lord for there he offered the holocaust, and\nsacrifice, and the fat of the peace offerings:  because the brazen altar\nthat was before the Lord, was too little to receive the holocaust, and\nsacrifice, and the fat of the peace offerings.","And Solomon made at the same time a solemn feast, and all Israel\nwith him, a great multitude, from the entrance of Emath to the river of\nEgypt, before the Lord our God, seven days and seven days, that is,\nfourteen days.","And on the eighth day, he sent away the people:  and they blessed\nthe king, and went to their dwellings, rejoicing, and glad in heart,\nfor all the good things that the Lord had done for David, his servant,\nand for Israel, his people."]}
