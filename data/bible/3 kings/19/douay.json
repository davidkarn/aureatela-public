{"verses":["And Achab told Jezabel all that Elias had done, and how he had\nslain all the prophets with the sword.","And Jezabel sent a messenger to Elias, saying:  Such and such\nthings may the gods do to me, and add still more, if by this hour to\nmorrow I make not thy life as the life of one of them.","Then EIias was afraid, and rising up, he went whithersoever he\nhad a mind:  and he came to Bersabee of Juda, and left his servant\nthere,","And he went forward, one day's journey into the desert.  And when\nhe was there, and sat under a juniper tree, he requested for his soul\nthat he might die, and said:  It is enough for me, Lord; take away my\nsoul:  for I am no better than my fathers.","And he cast himself down, and slept in the shadow of the juniper\ntree:  and behold an angel of the Lord touched him, and said to him:\nArise and eat.","He looked, and behold there was at his head a hearth cake, and a\nvessel of water:  and he ate and drank, and he fell asleep again.","And the angel of the Lord came again the second time, and touched\nhim, and said to him:  Arise, eat:  for thou hast yet a great way to go.","And he arose, and ate and drank, and walked in the strength of\nthat food forty days and forty nights, unto the mount of God, Horeb.","And when he was come thither, he abode in a cave.  and behold the\nword of the Lord came unto him, and he said to him:  What dost thou\nhere, Elias?","And he answered:  With zeal have I been zealous for the Lord God\nof hosts:  for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant:  they\nhave thrown down thy altars, they have slain thy prophets with the\nsword, and I alone am left, and they seek my life to take it away.","And he said to him:  Go forth, and stand upon the mount before\nthe Lord:  and behold the Lord passeth, and a great and strong wind\nbefore the Lord, overthrowing the mountains, and breaking the rocks in\npieces:  but the Lord is not in the wind.  And after the wind, an\nearthquake:  but the Lord is not in the earthquake.","And after the earthquake, a fire:  but the Lord is not in the\nfire.  And after the fire, a whistling of a gentle air.","And when Elias heard it, he covered his face with his mantle,\nand coming forth, stood in the entering in of the cave, and behold a\nvoice unto him, saying:  What dost thou here, Elias?  And he answered:","With zeal have I been zealous for the Lord God of hosts:  because\nthe children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant:  they have destroyed\nthy altars, they have slain thy prophets with the sword; and I alone am\nleft, and they seek my life to take it away.","And the Lord said to him:  Go, and return on thy way, through the\ndesert, to Damascus:  and when thou art come thither, thou shalt anoint\nHazael to be king over Syria;","And thou shalt anoint Jehu, the son of Namsi, to be king over\nIsrael:  and Eliseus, the son of Saphat, of Abelmeula, thou shalt anoint\nto be prophet in thy room.","And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall escape the sword\nof Hazael, shall be slain by Jehu:  and whosoever shall escape the sword\nof Jehu, shall be slain by Eliseus.","And I will leave me seven thousand men in Israel, whose knees\nhave not been bowed before Baal, and every mouth that hath not\nworshipped him, kissing the hands.","And Elias departing from thence, found Eliseus, the son of\nSaphat, ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen:  and he was one of them that\nwere ploughing with, twelve yoke of oxen:  and when Elias came up to\nhim, he cast his mantle upon him.","And he forthwith left the oxen, and run after Elias, and said:\nLet me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will\nfollow thee.  And he said to him:  Go, and return back:  for that which\nwas my part, I have done to thee.","And returning back from him, he took a yoke of oxen, and killed\nthem, and boiled the flesh with the plough of the oxen, and gave to the\npeople, and they ate:  and rising up, he went away, and followed Elias,\nand ministered to him."]}
