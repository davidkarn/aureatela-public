Nevertheless it was His pleasure that He should be born as a man, that in all things He might be like His supreme FatherÂ· For God the Father Himself, who is the origin and source of all things, inasmuch as He is without parents, is most truly named by Trismegistus \"fatherless\" and \"motherless,\"[fn-13-P1301_562201:125-nf] because He was born from no one. For which reason it was befitting that the Son also should be twice born, that He also might become \"fatherless\" and \"motherless.\" For in His first nativity, which was spiritual, He was \"motherless,\" because He was begotten by God the Father alone, without the office of a mother. But in His second, which was in the flesh, He was born of a virgin's womb without the office of a father, that, bearing a middle substance between God and man, He might be able, as it were, to take by the hand this frail and weak nature of ours, and raise it to immortality. He became both the Son of God through the Spirit, and the Son of man through the flesh,-that is, both God and man. The power of God was displayed in Him, from the works which He performed; the frailty of the man, from the passion which He endured: on what account He undertook it I will mention a little later. In the meantime, we learn from the predictions of the prophets that He was both God and man-composed[fn-13-P1302_563288:126-nf] of both natures. Isaiah testifies that He was God in these words:[fn-13-P1303_563787:127-nf] \"Egypt is wearied,[fn-13-P1304_563830:128-nf] and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and the Sabaeans, men of stature, shall come over unto Thee, and shall be Thy servants: and they shall walk behind Thee; in chains they shall fall down unto Thee, and shall make supplication unto Thee, Since God is in Thee, and there is no other God besides Thee. For Thou art God, and we knew Thee not, the God of Israel, the Savour. They shall all be confounded and ashamed who oppose Thee, and shall fall into confusion.\" In like manner the prophet Jeremiah[fn-13-P1305_564389:129-nf] thus speaks: \"This is our God, and there shall none other be compared unto Him. He hath found out all the way of knowledge, and hath given it unto Jacob His servant, and to Israel His beloved. Afterward He was seen upon earth, and dwelt among men.\"David also, in the forty-fourth Psalm:[fn-13-P1306_564809:130-nf] \"Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of Thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness; therefore God, Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness.\" By which word he also shows His name, since (as I have shown above) He was called Christ from His anointing. Then, that He was also man, Jeremiah teaches, saying:[fn-13-P1307_565217:131-nf] \"And He is a man, and who hath known Him? \"Also Isaiah:[fn-13-P1308_565337:132-nf] \"And God shall send to them a man, who shall save them, shall save them by judging.\" But Moses also, in Numbers,[fn-13-P1309_565499:133-nf] thus speaks: \"There shall arise a star out of Jacob, and a man[fn-13-P1310_565761:134-nf] shall spring forth from Israel.\" On which account the Milesian Apollo,[fn-13-P1311_565970:135-nf] being asked whether He was God or man, replied in this manner: \"He was mortal as to His body, being wise with wondrous works; but being taken with arms under Chaldean judges, with nails and the cross He endured a bitter end.\" In the first verse he spoke the truth, but he skilfully deceived him who asked the question, who was entirely ignorant of the mystery of the truth. For he appears to have denied that He was God. But when he acknowledges that He was mortal as to the flesh, which we also declare, it follows that as to the spirit He was God, which we affirm. For why would it have been necessary to make mention of the flesh, since it was sufficient to say that He was mortal? But being pressed by the truth, he could not deny the real state of the case; as that which he says, that He was wise.","title":"Book IV.

As you have listened already to Moses and Isaiah, so listen now to Jeremiah inculcating the same truth as they:-This is our God, and there shall be none other likened unto Him, Who hath found out all the way of knowledge, and hath given it unto Jacob His servant and to Israel His beloved. Afterward did He shew Himself upon earth and dwelt among men[fn-13-P1306_793321:83-nf] . For previously he had said, And He is Man, and Who shall know Him[fn-13-P1307_793413:84-nf] ?

Now I ask you what sense you would assign to No one hath seen God at any time, save the Only-begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father[fn-13-P1308_793640:85-nf] , when Jeremiah proclaims God seen on earth and dwelling among men? The Father confessedly cannot be seen except by the Son; Who then is This who was seen and dwelt among men? He must be our God, for He is God visible in human form, Whom men can handle. And take to heart the prophet's words, There shall be none other likened to Him. If you ask how this can be, listen to the remainder of the sentence, lest you be tempted to deny to the Father His share of the confession. Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is One. The whole passage is, There shall be none likened unto Him, Who hath found out all the way of knowledge, and hath given it unto Jacob His servant and to Israel His beloved. Afterward did He skew Himself upon earth and dwelt among men. For there is one Mediator between God and Men, Who is both God and Man; Mediator both in giving of the Law and in taking of our body. Therefore none other can be likened unto Him, for He is One, born from God into God, and the it was through Whom all things were created in heaven and earth, through Whom times and worlds were made. Everything, in fine, that exists owes its existence to His action. He it is that instructs Abraham, that speaks with Moses, that testifies to Israel, that abides in the prophets, that was born through the Virgin from the Holy Ghost, that nails to the cross of His passion the powers that are our foes, that slays death in hell, that strengthens the assurance of our hope by His Resurrection, that destroys the corruption of human flesh by the glory of His Body. Therefore none shall be likened unto Him. For these are the peculiar powers of God the Only-begotten; He alone was born from God, the blissful Possessor of such great prerogatives. No second god can be likened unto Him, for He is God from God, not born from any alien being. There is nothing new or strange or modern created in Him. When Israel hears that its God is one, and that no second god is likened, that men may deem him God, to God Who is God's Son, the revelation means that God the Father and God the Son are One altogether, not by confusion of Person but by unity of substance. For the prophet forbids us, because God the Son is God, to liken Him to some second deity.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":3,"verse":37,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"The Christian Faith, which in accordance with the command of our Lord has been preached to all nations by His disciples, is neither of men, nor by men, but by our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, Who being the Word, the Life, the Light, the Truth, and God, and Wisdom, and all else that He is by nature, for this cause above all was made in the likeness of man, and shared our nature, becoming like us in all things, yet without sin.

And, again, He is not a second God, for no other is likened unto Him; the truth that is in Him is nothing else than the truth of God. Why link together, in pretended devotion to the unity of God, true and false, base and genuine, unlike and unlike? The Father is God and the Son is God. God is in God; beside Him there is no God, and none other is likened unto Him so as to be God.

Surely he does not intend to charge against us also that we preach the doctrine of dissimilarity in essence! Why, it is rather to those who turn aside to this opinion that the reproach belongs of going about to make the Cross a shameful thing. For if by both parties alike the dispensation of the Passion is held as part of the faith, while we hold it necessary to honour, even as the Father is honoured, the God Who was manifested by the Cross, and they find the Passion a hindrance to glorifying the Only-begotten God equally with the Father that begat Him, then our sophist's charges recoil upon himself, and in the words with which he imagines himself to be accusing us, he is publishing his own doctrinal impiety. For it is clear that the reason why he sets the Father above the Son, and exalts Him with supreme honour, is this,-that in Him is not seen the shame of the Cross: and the reason why he asseverates that the nature of the Son varies in the sense of inferiority is this,-that the reproach of the Cross is referred to Him alone, and does not touch the Father. And let no one think that in saying this I am only following the general drift of his composition, for in going through all the blasphemy of his speech, which is there laboriously brought together, I found, in a passage later than that before us, this very blasphemy clearly expressed in undisguised language; and I propose to set forth, in the orderly course of my own argument, what they have written, which runs thus:-\"If,\" he says, \"he can show that the God Who is over all, Who is the unapproachable Light, was incarnate, or could be incarnate, came under authority, obeyed commands, came under the laws of men, bore the Cross, then let him say that the Light is equal to the Light.\" Who then is it who is ashamed of the Cross? he who, even after the Passion, worships the Son equally with the Father, or he who even before the Passion insults Him, not only by ranking Him with the creation, but by maintaining that He is of passible nature, on the ground that He could not have come to experience His sufferings had He not had a nature capable of such sufferings? We on our part assert that even the body in which He underwent His Passion, by being mingled with the Divine Nature, was made by that commixture to be that which the assuming[fn-16-P1610_927899:25-nf] Nature is. So far are we from entertaining any low idea concerning the Only-begotten God, that if anything belonging to our lowly nature was assumed in His dispensation of love for man, we believe that even this was transformed to what is Divine and incorruptible[fn-16-P1611_928232:26-nf] ; but Eunomius makes the suffering of the Cross to be a sign of divergence in essence, in the sense of inferiority, considering, I know not how, the surpassing act of power, by which He was able to perform this, to be an evidence of weakness; failing to perceive the fact that, while nothing which moves according to its own nature is looked upon as surprisingly wonderful, all things that overpass the limitations of their own nature become especially the objects of admiration, and to them every ear is turned, every mind is attentive, in wonder at the marvel. And hence it is that all who preach the word point out the wonderful character of the mystery in this respect,-that \"God was manifested in the flesh[fn-16-P1612_929216:27-nf] ,\" that \"the Word was made flesh[fn-16-P1613_929324:28-nf] ,\" that \"the Light shined in darkness[fn-16-P1614_929382:29-nf] ,\" \"the Life tasted death,\" and all such declarations which the heralds of the faith are wont to make, whereby is increased the marvellous character of Him Who manifested the superabundance of His power by means external to his own nature. But though they think fit to make this a subject for their insolence, though they make the dispensation of the Cross a reason for partitioning off the Son from equality of glory with the Father, we believe, as those \"who from the beginning were eye-witnesses and ministers of the word[fn-16-P1615_929942:30-nf] \" delivered to us by the Holy Scriptures, that the God who was in the beginning, \"afterwards\", as Baruch says, \"was seen upon the earth, and conversed with men[fn-16-P1616_930121:31-nf] ,\" and, becoming a ransom for our death, loosed by His own resurrection the bonds of death, and by Himself made the resurrection a way for all flesh[fn-16-P1617_930289:32-nf] , and being on the same throne and in the same glory with His own Father, will in the day of judgment give sentence upon those who are judged, according to the desert of the lives they have led. These are the things which we believe concerning Him Who was crucified, and for this cause we cease not to extol Him exceedingly, according to the measure of our powers, that He Who by reason of His unspeakable and unapproachable greatness is not comprehensible by any, save by Himself and the Father and the Holy Spirit, He, I say, was able even to descend to community with our weakness. But they adduce this proof of the Son's alienation in nature from the Father, that the Lord was manifested by the flesh and by the Cross, arguing on the ground that the Father's nature remained pure in impassibility, and could not in any way admit of a community which tended to passion, while the Son, by reason of the divergence of His nature by way of humiliation, was not incapable of being brought to experience the flesh and death, seeing that the change of condition was not great, but one which took place in a certain sense from one like state to another state kindred and homogeneous, because the nature of man is created, and the nature of the Only-begotten is created also. Who then is fairly charged with being ashamed of the Cross? he who speaks basely of it[fn-16-P1618_931677:33-nf] , or he who contends for its more exalted aspect? I know not whether our accuser, who thus abases the God Who was made known upon the Cross, has heard the lofty speech of Paul, in what terms and at what length he discourses with his exalted lips concerning that Cross. For he, who was able to make himself known by miracles so many and so great, says, \"God forbid that I should glory in anything else, than, in the Cross of Christ[fn-16-P1619_932244:34-nf] .\" And to the Corinthians he says that the word of the Cross is \"the power of God to them that are in a state of salvation[fn-16-P1620_932400:35-nf] .\" To the Ephesians, moreover, he describes by the figure of the Cross the power that controls and holds together the universe, when he expresses a desire that they may be exalted to know the exceeding glory of ibis power, calling it height, and depth, and breadth, and length[fn-16-P1621_932700:36-nf] , speaking of the several projections we behold in the figure of the Cross by their proper names, so that he calls the upper part \"height,\" and that which is below, on the opposite side of the junction, \"depth,\" while by the name \"length and breadth\" he indicates the cross-beam projecting to either side, that hereby might be manifested this great mystery, that both things in heaven, and things under the earth, and all the furthest bounds of the things that are, are ruled and sustained by Him Who gave an example of this unspeakable and mighty power in the figure of the Cross. But I think there is no need to contend further with such objections, as I judge it superfluous to be anxious about urging arguments against calumny when even a few words suffice to show the truth. Let us therefore pass on to another charge.","title":"Book V","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":3,"verse":35,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_16_lecture_xi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"14.

I must now resume the train of his complaints, that we may pass by none of the charges brought against us without an answer. And first I propose that we should examine this point, that he charges us with asserting that an ordinary man has wrought the salvation of the world. For although this point has been to some extent already cleared up by the investigations we have made, we shall yet briefly deal with it once more, that the mind of those who are acting as our judges on this slanderous accusation may be entirely freed from misapprehension. So far are we from referring to an ordinary man the cause of this great and unspeakable grace, that even if any should refer so great a boon to Peter and Paul, or to an angel from heaven, we should say with Paul, \"let him be anathema[fn-16-P1664_959817:2-nf] .\" For Paul was not crucified for us, nor were we baptized into a human name[fn-16-P1665_959923:3-nf] . Surely the doctrine which our adversaries oppose to the truth is not thereby strengthened when we confess that the saving power of Christ is more potent than human nature[fn-16-P1666_960112:4-nf] :-yet it may seem to be so, for their aim is to maintain at all points the difference of the essence of the Son from that of the Father, and they strive to show the dissimilarity of essence not only by the contrast of the Generated with the Ungenerate, but also by the opposition of the passible to the impassible. And while this is more openly maintained in the last part of their argument, it is also clearly shown in their present discourse[fn-16-P1667_961029:5-nf] . For if he finds fault with those who refer the Passion to the Human Nature, his intention is certainly to subject to the Passion the Godhead Itself. For our conception being twofold, and admitting of two developments, accordingly as the Divinity or the Humanity is held to have been in a condition of suffering, an attack on one of these views is clearly a maintaining of the other. Accordingly, if they find fault with those who look upon the Passion as concerning the Man, they will clearly approve those who say that the Godhead of the Son was subject to passion, and the position which these last maintain becomes an argument in favour of their own absurd doctrine. For if, according to their statement, the Godhead of the Son suffers, while that of the Father is preserved in absolute impassibility, then the impassible Nature is essentially different from that which admits passion. Seeing, therefore, that the dictum before us, though, so far as it is limited by number of words, it is a short one, yet affords principles and hypotheses for every kind ofdoctrinal pravity, it would seem right that ourreaders should require in our reply not so much brevity as soundness. We, then, neither attribute our own salvation to a man, nor admit that the incorruptible and Divine Nature is capable of suffering and mortality: but since we must assuredly believe the Divine utterances which declare to us that the Word that was in the beginning was God[fn-16-P1668_962564:6-nf] , and that afterward the Word made flesh was seen upon the earth and conversed with men[fn-16-P1669_962673:7-nf] , we admit in our creed those conceptions which are consonant with the Divine utterance. For when we hear that He is Light, and Power, and Righteousness, and Life, and Truth, and that by Him all things were made, we account all these and such-like statements as things to be believed, referring them to God the Word: but when we hear of pain, of slumber, of need, of trouble, of bonds, of nails, of the spear, of blood, of wounds, of burial, of the sepulchre, and all else of this kind, even if they are somewhat opposed to what has previously been stated, we none the less admit them to be things to be believed, and true, having regard to the flesh; which we receive by faith as conjoined with the Word. For as it is not possible to contemplate the peculiar attributes of the flesh as existing in the Word that was in the beginning, so also on the other hand we may not conceive those which are proper to the Godhead as existing in the nature of the flesh. As, therefore, the teaching of the Gospel concerning our Lord is mingled, partly of lofty and Divine ideas, partly of those which are lowly and human, we assign every particular phrase accordingly to one or other of these Natures which we conceive in the mystery, that which is human to the Humanity, that which is lofty to the Godhead, and say that, as God, the Son is certainly impassible and incapable of corruption: and whatever suffering is asserted concerning Him in the Gospel, He assuredly wrought by means of His Human Nature which admitted of such suffering. For verily the Godhead works the salvation of the world by means of that body which encompassed It, in such wise that the suffering was of the body, but the operation was of God; and even if some wrest to the support of the opposite doctrine the words of the Apostle, \"God spared not His own Sons,[fn-16-P1670_964521:8-nf] ,\" and, \"God sent His own Son[fn-16-P1671_964569:9-nf] ,\" and other similar phrases which seem to refer, in the matter of the Passion, to the Divine Nature, and not to the Humanity, we shall none the less refuse to abandon sound doctrine, seeing that Paul himself declares to us more clearly the mystery of this subject. For he everywhere attributes to the Human element in Christ the dispensation of the Passion, when he says, \"for since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead[fn-16-P1672_965040:10-nf] ,\" and, \"God, sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, condemned sin in the flesh[fn-16-P1673_965154:11-nf] \" (for he says, \"in the flesh,\" not \"in the Godhead\"); and \"He was crucified through weakness\" (where by \"weakness\" he means \"the flesh\"), \"yet liveth by power[fn-16-P1674_965337:12-nf] \" (while he indicates by \"power\" the Divine Nature); and, \"He died unto sin\" (that is, with regard to the body), \"but liveth unto God[fn-16-P1675_965492:13-nf] \" (that is, with regard to the Godhead, so that by these words it is established that, while the Man tasted death, the immortal Nature did not admit the suffering of death); and again; \"He made Him to be sin for us, Who knew no sin[fn-16-P1676_965742:14-nf] ,\" giving once more the name of \"sin\" to the flesh.","title":"Book VI","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":3,"verse":37,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_17_book_vi","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"How comes it, then, that you fail to see that the whole conception of your argument on the subject is being overthrown, and go on making yourself ridiculous with your childish web of sophistry, saying that, if we believe that He who was apparent to the senses has been made by God to be Christ and Lord, it necessarily follows that the Lord once more \"emptied Himself\" anew to become Man, and underwent a second birth? What advantage does your doctrine get from this? How does what you say show the King of creation to be created? For my own part I assert on the other side that our view is supported by those who contend against us, and that the rhetorician, in his exceeding attention to the matter, has failed to see that in pushing, as he supposed, the argument to an absurdity, he is fighting on the side of those whom he attacks, with the very weapons he uses for their overthrow. For if we are to believe that the change of condition in the case of Jesus was from a lofty state to a lowly one, and if the Divine and uncreated Nature alone transcends the creation, he will, perhaps, when he thoroughly surveys his own argument, come over to the ranks of truth, and agree that the Uncreated came to be in the created, in His love for man. But if he imagines that he demonstrates the created character of the Lord by showing that He, being God, took part in human nature, he will find many such passages to establish the same opinion which carry out their support of his argument in a similar way. For since He was the Word and was God, and \"afterwards,\" as the prophet says, \"was seen upon earth and conversed with men[fn-17-P1730_999407:54-nf] ,\" He will hereby be proved to be one of the creatures! And if this is held to be beside the question, similar passages too are not quite akin to the subject. For in sense it is just the same to say that the Word that was in the beginning was manifested to men through the flesh, and to say that being in the form of God He put on the form of a servant: and if one of these statements gives no help for the establishment of his blasphemy, he must needs give up the remaining one also. He is kind enough, however, to advise us to abandon our error, and to point out the truth which He himself maintains. He tells us that the Apostle Peter declares Him to have been made Who was in the beginning the Word and God. Well, if he were making up dreams for our amusement, and giving us information about the prophetic interpretation of the visions of sleep, there might be no risk in allowing him to set forth the riddles of his imagination at his pleasure. But when he tells us that he is explaining the Divine utterances, it is no longer safe for us to leave him to interpret the words as he likes. What does the Scripture say? \"God made Lord and Christ this Jesus whom ye crucified[fn-17-P1731_1000603:55-nf] .\" When everything, then, is found to concur-the demonstrative word denoting Him Who is spoken of by the Name of His Humanity, the charge against those who were stained with blood-guiltiness, the suffering of the Cross-our thought necessarily turns to that which was apparent to the senses. But he asserts that while Peter uses these words it is the pretemporal existence that is indicated by the word \"made\"[fn-17-P1732_1001030:56-nf] . Well, we may safely allow nurses and old wives to jest with children, and to lay down the meaning of dreams as they choose: but when inspired Scripture is set before us for exposition, the great Apostle forbids us to have recourse to old wives' tattle[fn-17-P1733_1001439:57-nf] . When I hear \"the Cross\" spoken of, I understand the Cross, and when I hear mention of a human name, I understand the nature which that name connotes. So when I hear from Peter that \"this\" one was made Lord and Christ, I do not doubt that he speaks of Him Who had been before the eyes of men, since the saints agree with one another in this matter as well as in others. For, as he says that He Who was crucified has been made Lord, so Paul also says that He was \"highly exalted[fn-17-P1734_1001970:58-nf] ,\" after the Passion and the Resurrection, not being exalted in so far forth as He is God. For what height is there more sublime than the Divine height, that he should say God was exalted thereunto? But he means that the lowliness of the Humanity was exalted, the word, I suppose, indicating the assimilation and union of the Man Who was assumed to the exalted state of the Divine Nature. And even if one were to allow him licence to misinterpret the Divine utterance, not even so will his argument conclude in accordance with the aim of his heresy. For be it granted that Peter does say of Him Who was in the beginning, \"God made Him Lord and Christ, this Jesus Whom ye crucified,\" we shall find that even so his blasphemy does not gain any strength against the truth. \"God made Him,\" he says, \"Lord and Christ.\" To which of the words are we to refer the word made? with which of those that are employed in this sentence are we to connect the word? There are three before us:-\"this,\" and \"Lord,\" and \"Christ.\" With which of these three will he construct the word \"made\"? No one is so bold against the truth as to deny that \"made\" has reference to \"Christ\" and \"Lord\"; for Peter says that He, being already whatever He was, was \"made Christ and Lord\" by the Father.","title":"Book VI","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":3,"verse":38,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_19_dialogue_i_the_immutable_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"91","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Eran.-The Prophet says[fn-29-P2928_887594:30-nf] he was seen on the earth,","title":"Dialogue I.-The Immutable.","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":3,"verse":35,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_24_book_xviii","source_chapter":35,"source_paragraph":"166","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Jeremiah, like Isaiah, is one of the greater prophets, not of the minor, like the others from whose writings I have just given extracts. He prophesied when Josiah reigned in Jerusalem, and Ancus Martius at Rome, when the captivity of the Jews was already at hand; and he continued to prophesy down to the fifth month of the captivity, as we find from his writings. Zephaniah, one of the minor prophets, is put along with him, because he himself says that he prophesied in the days of Josiah; but he does not say till when. Jeremiah thus prophesied not only in the times of Ancus Martius, but also in those of Tarquinius Priscus, whom the Romans had for their fifth king. For he had already begun to reign when that captivity took place. Jeremiah, in prophesying of Christ, says, \"The breath of our mouth, the Lord Christ, was taken in our sins,\"[fn-34-P3461_1876290:55-nf] thus briefly showing both that Christ is our Lord and that He suffered for us. Also in another place he says, \"This is my God, and there shall none other be accounted of in comparison of Him; who hath found out all the way of prudence, and hath given it to Jacob His servant, and to Israel His beloved: afterwards He was seen on the earth, and conversed with men.\"[fn-34-P3462_1876674:56-nf] Some attribute this testimony not to Jeremiah, but to his secretary, who was called Baruch; but it is more commonly ascribed to Jeremiah. Again the same prophet says concerning Him, \"Behold the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise up unto David a righteous shoot, and a King shall reign and shall be wise, and shall do judgment and justice in the earth. In those days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell confidently: and this is the name which they shall call Him, Our righteous Lord.\"[fn-34-P3463_1877201:57-nf] And of the calling of the nations which was to come to pass, and which we now see fulfilled, he thus spoke: \"O Lord my God, and my refuge in the day of evils. to Thee shall the nations come from the utmost end of the earth, saying, Truly our fathers have worshipped lying images, wherein there is no profit.\"[fn-34-P3464_1877534:58-nf] But that the Jews, by whom He behoved even to be slain, were not going to acknowledge Him, this prophet thus intimates: \"Heavy is the heart through all; and He is a man, and who shall know Him?\"[fn-34-P3465_1877748:59-nf] That passage also is his which I have quoted in the seventeenth book concerning the new testament, of which Christ is the Mediator.

You will find many passages which require no such explanation as has been given here of Jacob's prophecy.

For Arius and Eunomius, asserting the only begotten Son of God to be a creature, and made out of the non-existent, and a servant, have ventured to apply to His godhead what is said in lowly and human sense; establishing by such means the difference of substance and the unlikeness. Besides this, to be brief, he argues that the very impassible and immutable Godhead of the Christ suffered, and was crucified, dead, and buried. This goes beyond even the madness of Arius and Eunomius, for this pitch of impiety has not been reached even by them that dare to call the maker and creator of the universe a creature. Furthermore he blasphemes against the Holy Ghost, denying that It proceeds from the Father, in accordance with the word of the Lord, but maintaining that It has Its origin of the Son. Here we have the fruit of the Apollinarian seed; here we come near the evil husbandry of Macedonius. Such are the offspring of the Egyptian, viler children of a vile father. This growth, which men, entrusted with the healing of souls, ought to make abortive while yet in the womb, or destroy as soon as it is born, as dangerous and deadly to mankind, is cherished by these excellent persons, and promoted with great energy, alike to their own ruin and to that of all who will listen to them.We, on the contrary, earnestly desire to keep our heritage untouched; and the faith which we have received, and in which we have been ourselves baptized, and baptize others, we strive to preserve uninjured and undefiled. We confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, perfect God and perfect man, of a reasonable soul and body, was begotten of the Father before the ages, as touching the Godhead; and in the last days for us men and our salvation (was born) of the Virgin Mary; that the same Lord is of one substance with the Father as touching the Godhead, and of one substance with us as touching the manhood. For there was an union of two natures. Wherefore we acknowledge one Christ, one Son, one Lord; but we do not destroy the union; we believe it to have been made without confusion, in obedience to the word of the Lord to the Jews, \"Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.\"[fn-65-P6501_1678851:549-nf] If on the contrary there had been mixture and confusion, and one nature was made out of both, He ought to have said \"Destroy me and in three days I shall be raised.\" But now, to show that there is a distinction between God according to His nature, and the temple, and that both are one Christ, His words are \"Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up,\" clearly teaching that it was not God who was undergoing destruction, but the temple. The nature of this latter was susceptible of destructions while the power of the former raised what was being destroyed. Furthermore it is in obedience to the divine Scriptures that we acknowledge the Christ to be God and man. That our Lord Jesus Christ is God is asserted by the blessed evangelist John \"In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was. God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him and without Him was not anything made that was made.\"[fn-65-P6502_1679824:550-nf] And again, \"That was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\"[fn-65-P6503_1679932:551-nf] And the Lord Himself distinctly teaches us, \"He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.\"[fn-65-P6504_1680039:552-nf] And \"I and my Father are one\"[fn-65-P6505_1680089:553-nf] and \"I am in the Father and the Father in me,\"[fn-65-P6506_1680155:554-nf] and the blessed Paul in his epistle to the Hebrews says \"Who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power\"[fn-65-P6507_1680368:555-nf] and in the epistle to the Philippians \"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus; who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made Himself of no reputation and took upon Him the form of a servant.\"[fn-65-P6508_1680634:556-nf] And in the Epistle to the Romans, \"Whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all God blessed for ever.

They were added in our Church, as is well known, on account of the Sabellian heresy, called by us \"the Patripassian,\" that, namely, which says that the Father Himself was born of the Virgin andbecame visible, or affirms that He suffered in the flesh. To exclude such impiety, therefore, concerning the Father, our forefathers seem to have added these words, calling the Father \"invisible and impassible.\" For it is evident that the Son, not the Father, became incarnate and was born in the flesh, and that from that nativity in the flesh the Son became \"visible and passible.\" Yet so far as regards that immortal substance of the Godhead, which He possesses, and which is one and the same with that of the Father, we must believe that neither the Father, nor the Son, nor the Holy Ghost is \"visible or passible.\" But the Son, in that He condescended to assume flesh, was both seen and also suffered in the flesh.

For my part, I approve of Plato, who plainly lays it down as a law, that a man is not to labour for wealth of gold or silver, nor to possess a useless vessel which is not for some necessary purpose, and moderate; so that the same thing may serve for many purposes, and the possession of a variety of things may be done away with. Excellently, therefore, the Divine Scripture, addressing boasters and lovers of their own selves, says, \"Where are the rulers of the nations, and the lords of the wild beasts of the earth, who sport among the birds of heaven, who treasured up silver and gold, in whom men trusted, and there was no end of their substance, who fashioned silver and gold, and were full of care? There is no finding of their works. They have vanished, and gone down to Hades.\"[fn-38-P3855_1176286:93-nf] Such is the reward of display. For though such of us as cultivate the soil need a mattock and plough, none of us will make a pickaxe of silver or a sickle of gold, but we employ the material which is serviceable for agriculture, not what is costly. What prevents those who are capable of considering what is similar from entertaining the same sentiments with respect to household utensils, of which let use, not expense, be the measure? For tell me, does the table-knife not cut unlest it be studded with silver, and have its handle made of ivory? Or must we forge Indian steel in order to divide meat, as when we call for a weapon for the fight? What if the basin be of earthenware? will it not receive the dirt of the hands? or the footpan the dirt of the foot? Will the table that is fashioned with ivory feet be indignant at bearing a three-halfpenny loaf? Will the lamp not dispense light because it is the work of the potter, not of the goldsmith? I affirm that truckle-beds afford no worse repose than the ivory couch; and the goatskin coverlet being amply sufficient to spread on the bed, there is no need, of purple or scarlet coverings. Yet to condemn, notwithstanding, frugality, through the stupidity of luxury, the author of mischief, what a prodigious error, what senseless conceit! See. The Lord ate from a common bowl, and made the disciples recline on the grass on the ground, and washed their feet, girded with a linen towel-He, the lowly-minded God, and Lord of the universe. He did not bring down a silver foot-bath from heaven. He asked to drink of the Samaritan woman, who drew the water from the well in an earthenware vessel, not seeking regal gold, but teaching us how to quench thirst easily. For He made use, not extravagance His aim. And He ate and drank at feasts, not digging metals from the earth, nor using vessels of gold and silver, that is, vessels exhaling the odour of rust-such fumes as the rust of smoking[fn-38-P3856_1178255:94-nf] metal gives off.","title":"Book II.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":3,"verse":35,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_45_oration_xxx_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"17","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"XIII. The eighth passage is, That they may know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ Whom Thou hast sent;[fn-45-P4560_1435250:66-nf] and There is none good save one, that is, God.[fn-45-P4561_1435315:67-nf] The solution of this appears to me very easy. For if you attribute this only to the Father, where will you place the Very Truth? For if you conceive in this manner of the meaning of To the only wise God,[fn-45-P4562_1435540:68-nf] or Who only hath Immortality, Dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto,[fn-45-P4563_1435643:69-nf] or of to the king of the Ages, immortal, invisible, and only wise God,[fn-45-P4564_1435731:70-nf] then the Son has vanished under sentence of death, or of darkness, or at any rate condemned to be neither wise nor king, nor invisible, nor God at all, which sums up all these points. And how will you prevent His Goodness, which especially belongs to God alone, from perishing with the rest? I, however, think that the passage That they may know Thee the only true God, was said to overthrow those gods which are falsely so called, for He would not have added and Jesus Christ Whom Thou hast sent, if The Only True God were contrasted with Him, and the sentence did not proceed upon the basis of a common Godhead. The \"None is Good\" meets the tempting Lawyer, who was testifying to His Goodness viewed as Man. For perfect goodness, He says, is God's alone, even if a man is called perfectly good. As for instance, A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things.[fn-45-P4565_1436638:71-nf] And, I will give the kingdom to one who is good above Thee.[fn-45-P4566_1436717:72-nf] ...

It will be best of all if we can persuade you of this. But if not, what will you say to the suggestion on the other side, that on your hypothesis the Son has been called the only God. In what passage? Why, in this:-This is your God; no other shall be accounted of in comparison with Him, and a little further on, after this did He shew Himself upon earth, and conversed with men.[fn-45-P4568_1437402:74-nf] This addition proves clearly that the words are not used of the Father, but of the Son; for it was He Who in bodily form companied with us, and was in this lower world. Now, if we should determine to take these words as said in contrast with the Father, and not with the imaginary gods, we lose the Father by the very terms which we were pressing against the Son.

The case being thus, let who will among them consider the matter, so that one may abash them by the following question; Is it right to say that what is God's offspring and proper to Him is out of nothing? or is it reasonable in the very idea, that what is from God has accrued to Him, that a man should dare to say that the Son is not always? For in this again the generation of the Son exceeds and transcends the thoughts of man, that we become fathers of our own children in time, since we ourselves first were not and then came into being; but God, in that He ever is, is ever Father of the Son[fn-32-P3293_1300094:76-nf] . And the origination of mankind is brought home to us from things that are parallel; but, since `no one knoweth the Son but the Father, and no one knoweth the Father but the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him[fn-32-P3294_1300943:77-nf] ,' therefore the sacred writers to whom the Son has revealed Him, have given us a certain image from things visible, saying, `Who is the brightness of His glory, and the Expression of His Person[fn-32-P3295_1301157:78-nf] ;' and again, `For with Thee is the well of life, and in Thy light shall we see lights[fn-32-P3296_1301260:79-nf] ;' and when the Word chides lsrael, He says, `Thou hast forsaken the Fountain of wisdom[fn-32-P3297_1301367:80-nf] ;' and this Fountain it is which says, `They have forsaken Me the Fountain of living waters[fn-32-P3298_1301478:81-nf] .' And mean indeed and very dim is the illustration[fn-32-P3299_1301935:82-nf] compared with what we desiderate; but yet it is possible from it to understand something above man's nature, instead of thinking the Son's generation to be on a level with ours. For who can even imagine that the radiance of light ever was not, so that he should dare to say that the Son was not always, or that the Son was not before His generation? or who is capable of separating the radiance from the sun, or to conceive of the fountain as ever void of life, that he should madly say, `The Son is from nothing,' who says, `I am the life[fn-33-P3300_1302494:83-nf] ,' or `alien to the Father's essence,' who, says, `He that hath seen Me, hath seen the: Father[fn-33-P3301_1302607:84-nf] ?' for the sacred writers wishing us thus to understand, have given these illustrations; and it is unseemly and most irreligious, when Scripture contains such images, to form ideas concerning our Lord from others which are neither in Scripture, nor have any religious bearing.","title":"De Decretis or Defence of the Nicene Definition","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":3,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_53_v_conference_of_abbot_serapion_","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"65","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"But in one matter vainglory is found to be a useful thing for beginners. I mean by those who are still troubled by carnal sins, as for instance, if, when they are troubled by the spirit of fornication, they formed an idea of the dignity of the priesthood, or of reputation among all men, by which they maybe thought saints and immaculate: and so with these considerations they repell the unclean suggestions of lust, as deeming them base and at least unworthy of their rank and reputation; and so by means of a smaller evil they overcome a greater one. For it is better for a man to be troubled by the sin of vainglory than for him to fall into the desire for fornication, from which he either cannot recover at all or only with great difficulty after he has fallen. And this thought is admirably expressed byone of the prophets speaking in the person of God, and saying: \"For My name's sake I will remove My wrath afar off: and with My praise I will bridle thee lest thou shouldest perish,\"[fn-41-P4156_1536813:24-nf] i.e., while you are enchained by the praises of vainglory, you cannot possibly rush on into the depths of hell, or plunge irrevocably into the commission of deadly sins. Nor need we wonder that this passion has the power of checking anyone from rushing into the sin of fornication, since it has been again and again proved by many examples that when once a man has been affected by its poison and plague, it makes him utterly indefatigable, so that he scarcely feels a fast of even two or three days. And we have often known some who are living in this desert, confessing that when their home was in the monasteries of Syria they could without difficulty go for five days without food, while now they are so overcome with hunger even by the third hour, that they can scarcely keep ontheir daily fast tothe ninth hour. And on this subject there is a very neat answer of Abbot Macarius[fn-41-P4157_1537717:25-nf] to one who asked him why he was troubled with hunger as early as the third hour in the desert, when in the monastery he had often scorned food for a whole week, without feeling hungry. \"Because,\" said he, \"here there is nobody to see your fast, and feed and support you with his praise of you: but there you grew fat on the notice of others and the food of vainglory.\" And of the way in which, as we said, the sin of fornication is prevented by an attack of vainglory, there is an excellent and significant figure in the book of Kings, where, when the children of Israel had been taken captive by Necho, King of Egypt, Nebuchadnezzar, King of Assyria, came up and brought them back from the borders of Egypt to their own country, not indeed meaning to restore them to their former liberty and their native land, but meaning to carry them off to his own land and to transport them to a still more distant country than the land of Egypt in which they had been prisoners. And this illustration exactly applies to the case before us. For though there is less harm in yielding to the sin of vainglory than to fornication, yet it is more difficult to escape from the dominion of vainglory. For somehow or other the prisoner who is carried off to a greater distance, will have more difficulty in returning to his native land and the freedom of his fathers, and the prophet's rebuke will be deservedly aimed at him: \"Wherefore art thou grown old in a strange country?[fn-41-P4158_1539217:26-nf] since a man is rightly said to have grown old in a strange country, if he has not broken up the Found of his faults. Of pride there are two kinds: (I) carnal, and (2) spiritual, which is the worse. For it especially attacks those who are seen to have made progress in some good qualities.","title":"V.

And what is the character of the arms of this centurion, and for what use in battle they are, hear the blessed Apostle declaring: \"The arms,\" he says \"of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty to God.\" He tells us their character; viz., that they are not carnal or weak, but spiritual and mighty to God. Then he next suggests in what struggles they are to be used: \"Unto the pulling down of fortifications, purging the thoughts, and every height that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every understanding unto the obedience of Christ, and having in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience shall be first fulfilled.\"[fn-44-P4426_1628570:12-nf] And since though useful, it yet belongs to another time to run through these one by one, I only want you to see the different sorts of these arms and their characteristics, as we also ought always to walk with them girt upon us if we mean to fight the Lord's battles and to serveamong the centurions of the gospel. \"Take,\" he says \"the shield of faith, wherewith ye may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one.\"[fn-44-P4427_1629016:13-nf] Faith then is that which intercepts the flaming darts of lust, and destroys them by the fear of future judgment, and belief in the heavenly kingdom. \"And the breastplate,\" he says, \"of charity.\"[fn-44-P4428_1629229:14-nf] This indeed is that which going round the vital parts of the breast and protecting what is exposed to the deadly wounds of swelling thoughts, keeps off the blows opposed to it, and does not allow the darts of the devil to penetrate to our inner man. For it \"endureth all things, suffereth all things, beareth all things.\"[fn-44-P4429_1629571:15-nf] \"And for an helmet the hope of salvation.\"[fn-44-P4430_1629635:16-nf] The helmet is what protects the head. As then Christ is our head, we ought always in all temptations and persecutions to protect it with the hope of future good things to come, and especially to keep faith in Him whole and undefiled. For it is possible for one who has lost other parts of the body, weak as he may be, still to survive: but even a short time of living is extended to no one without a head. \"And the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God.\"[fn-44-P4431_1630117:17-nf] For it is \"sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart:\"[fn-44-P4432_1630326:18-nf] as it divides and cuts off whatever carnal and earthly things it may find in us. And whosoever is protected by these arms will ever be defended from the weapons and ravages of his foes, and will not be led away bound in the chains of his spoilers, a captive and a prisoner, to the hostile land of vain thoughts, nor hear the words of the prophet: \"Why art thou grown old in a strange country?\"[fn-44-P4433_1630738:19-nf] But he will stand like a triumphant conqueror in the land of thoughts which he has chosen. Would you understand too the strength and courage of this centurion, by which he bears these arms of which we spoke before as not carnal but mighty to God? Hear of the selection by which the King himself marks and approves brave men when he summons them to the spiritual combat. \"Let,\" says He, \"the weak say that I am strong;\" and: \"Let him who is the sufferer become a warrior.\"[fn-44-P4434_1631231:20-nf] You see then that none but sufferers and weak people can fight the Lord's battles, weak indeed with that weakness, rounded on which that centurion of ours in the gospel said with confidence: \"For when I am weak, then am I strong,\" and again, \"for strength is made perfect in weakness.\"[fn-44-P4435_1631546:21-nf] Of which weakness one of the prophets says: \"And he that is weak among them shall be as the house of David.[fn-44-P4436_1631678:22-nf] For the patient sufferer shall fight these wars, with that patience of which it is said \"patience is necessary for you that doing the will of God you may receive the reward.\"[fn-44-P4437_1631872:23-nf] ","title":"VII.

Are alI one body in respect of substance, or is it that we become one in the power and disposition of unity of mind?[fn-37-P3740_1188317:229-nf] In the same manner the Son, who was sent and was not known of those who are in the world, confessed that He was in the Father in power and disposition. For the Son is the one mind of the Father. We who have the Father's mind believe so (in Him); but they who have it not have denied the Son. And if, again, they choose to allege the fact that Philip inquired about the Father, saying, \"Show us the Father, and it sufficeth us,\" to whom the Lord made answer in these terms: \"Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father. Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? \"[fn-37-P3741_1189756:230-nf] and if they choose to maintain that their dogma is ratified by this passage, as if He owned Himself to be the Father, let them know that it is decidedly against them, and that they are confuted by this very word. For though Christ had spoken of Himself, and showed Himself among all as the Son, they had not yet recognised Him to be such, neither had they been able to apprehend or contemplate His real power. And Philip, not having been able to receive this, as far as it was possible to see it, requested to behold the Father. To whom then the Lord said, \"Philip, have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.\" By which He means, If thou hast seen me, thou mayest know the Father through me. For through the image, which is like (the original), the Father is made readily known. But if thou hast not known the image, which is the Son, how dost thou seek to see the Father? And that this is the case is made clear by the rest of the chapter, which signifies that the Son who \"has been set forth[fn-37-P3742_1190865:231-nf] was sent from the Father,[fn-37-P3743_1190910:232-nf] and goeth to the Father.\"[fn-37-P3744_1190961:233-nf] ","title":"Part II.-Dogmatical and Historical.","author":"Hippolytus"},{"chapter":3,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_57_discourse_i","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"53","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"19.

But a fountain it would then cease to be; for what begetteth not from itself, is not a fountain[fn-54-P5425_2127474:125-nf] . What a load of extravagance! for God promises that those who do His will shall be as a fountain which the water fails not, saying by Isaiah the prophet, `And the Lord shall satisfy thy soul in drought, and make thy bones fat; and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not[fn-54-P5426_2127811:126-nf] .'

For in It were all things made, as David says in the Psalm, `In Wisdom bast Thou made them all[fn-54-P5427_2128231:127-nf] ;' and Solomon says, `The Lord by Wisdom hath formed the earth, by understanding hath He established the heavens[fn-54-P5428_2128364:128-nf] .'

But if he shrinks from this as unseemly, and excludes God from that all, it is but consistent that he should also exclude from that all the Only-Begotten Son, as being proper to the Father's essence. And, if He be not one of the all[fn-54-P5432_2129281:132-nf] , it is sin to say concerning Him, `He was not,' and `He was not before His generation.'

For the Apostle did not number individually, so as to say `whether Angel, or Throne, or Dominion, or Authority,' but he mentions together all according to their kind, `whether Angels, or Archangels, or Principalities[fn-61-P6189_2470971:321-nf] :' for in this way is the origination of the creatures.

And if He is not such a beginning, then neither is He a creature, but it is very plain that He differs in essence and nature from the creatures, and is other than they, and is Likeness and Image of the sole and true God, being Himself sole also. Hence He is not classed with creatures in Scripture, but David rebukes those who dare even to think of Him as such, saying, `Who among the gods is like unto the Lord[fn-61-P6192_2473012:324-nf] ?' and `Who is like unto the Lord among the sons of God?' and Baruch, `This is our God, and another shall not be reckoned wills Him[fn-61-P6193_2473166:325-nf] .'

And thus both truly say of Christ: \"Thou art our God and we knew Thee not.\" For those who did not believe in God were as ignorant of Him as those who denied the Son of God. If therefore Christ is to be believed in, as the truth declares, as the Deity asserts, as indeed Christ Himself declares, who is both, why are you miserably trying in your madness to interpose between God and Christ? Why do you seek to divide His body from the Son of God, and try to separate God from Himself? You are severing what is one, and dividing what is joined together. Believe the Word of God concerning God: for you cannot possibly make a better confession of God's Divinity than by confessing with your voice that which God teaches about Himself. For you must knew that, as the Prophet says, \"the Lord Himself is God, who found out all the way of knowledge; who was seen upon earth and conversed with men.\"[fn-71-P7165_2610393:42-nf] He brought the light of faith into the world. He showed the light of salvation. \"For God is the Lord, and hath given us light.\"[fn-71-P7166_2610550:43-nf] Then believe Him, and love Him, and confess Him. For since, as it is written, \"Every knee shall bow to Him, of things in heaven, and things on earth, and things under the earth, and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord in the glory of God the Father,\"[fn-71-P7167_2610842:44-nf] whether you will or no, you cannot deny that Jesus Christ is Lord in the glory of God the Father. For this is the crowning virtue of a perfect confession, to acknowledge that Jesus Christ is ever Lord and God in the glory of God the Father.","title":"Book IV.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":3,"verse":37,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_83_book_v_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"31","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"HE it is then of whom the Prophet says: \"For in Thee is God, and there is no God beside Thee.

As elsewhere the same Prophet says: \"Truth has sprung from the earth and righteousness hath looked down from heaven,\"[fn-72-P7207_2625315:16-nf] that we may know that when the Son of God looked down from heaven (i.e., came and descended), righteousness was born of the flesh of the Virgin, no phantasm of a body, but the Truth: for He is the Truth, according to His own witness of Truth: \"I am the Truth and the life.\"[fn-72-P7208_2625610:17-nf] And so as we have proved in the earlier books that this Truth; viz., the Lord Jesus Christ, was God when born of the Virgin, let us now do as we determined to do in the book before this, and show that He who was to be born of the Virgin, was always declared to be God beforehand. And so the prophet Isaiah says, \"Cease ye from the man whose breath is in his nostrils, for it is He in whom he is reputed to be;\" or as it is more exactly and clearly in the Hebrew: \"for he is reputed high.\"[fn-72-P7209_2626158:18-nf] But by saying \"cease ye,\" a term which deprecates violence, he admirably denotes the disturbance of persecution. \"Cease ye,\" he says, \"from the man whose breath is in his nostrils, for he is reputed high.\" Does he not in one and the same sentence speak of the taking upon Him of the manhood, and the truth of His Godhead? \"Cease ye,\" he says, \"from the man whose breath is in his nostrils, for he is reputed high.\" Does he not, I ask you, seem plainly to address the Lord's persecutors, and to say, \"Cease ye from the man\" whom ye are persecuting, for this man is God: and though He appears in the lowliness of human flesh, yet He still continues in the high estate of Divine glory? But by saying \"Cease ye from the man whose breath is in his nostrils,\" he admirably showed His manhood, by the clearest tokens of a human body, and this fearlessly and confidently, as one who would as urgently assert the truth of His humanity as that of His Godhead, for this is the true and Catholic faith, to believe that the Lord Jesus Christ possessed the substance of a true body just as He possessed a true and perfect Divinity. Unless possibly you think that anything can be made out of the fact that he uses the word \"High\" instead of \"God\"; whereas it is the habit of holy Scripture to put \"High\" for \"God,\" as where the prophet says: \"the Most High uttered His voice and the earth was moved,\"[fn-72-P7210_2627569:19-nf] and \"Thou alone art Most High over all the earth.\"[fn-72-P7211_2627652:20-nf] Isaiah too, who says this: \"The High and lofty one who inhabit eth eternity\":[fn-72-P7212_2627751:21-nf] where we are clearly to understand that as he there puts Most High without adding the name of God, so here too he speaks of God by the name of Most High. So then, since the Divine word spoken by the prophet clearly announced beforehand that the Lord jesus Christ would be both God and man, let us now see whether the New Testament corresponds to and harmonizes with the testimony of the Old.","title":"Book V.","author":"John Cassian"}]
