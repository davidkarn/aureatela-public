{"verses":["Wherefore the Lord our God hath made good his word, that he spoke\nto us, and to our judges that have judged Israel, and to our kings, and\nto our princes, and to all Israel and Juda:","That the Lord would bring upon us great evils, such as never\nhappened under heaven, as they have come to pass in Jerusalem,\naccording to the things that are written in the law of Moses:","That a man should eat the flesh of his own son, and the flesh of\nhis own daughter.","And he hath delivered them up to be under the hand of all the\nkings that are round about us, to be a reproach, and desolation among\nall the people, among whom the Lord hath scattered us.","And we are brought under, and are not uppermost:  because we have\nsinned against the Lord our God, by not obeying his voice.","To the Lord our God belongeth justice:  but to us, and to our\nfathers confusion of face, as at this day.","For the Lord hath pronounced against us all these evils that are\ncome upon us:","And we have not entreated the face of the Lord our God, that we\nmight return every one of us from our most wicked ways.","And the Lord hath watched over us for evil, and hath brought it\nupon us:  for the Lord is just in all his works which he hath commanded\nus:","And we have not hearkened to his voice to walk in the\ncommandments of the Lord which he hath set before us.","And now, O Lord God of Israel, who hast brought thy people out of\nthe land of Egypt with a strong hand, and with signs, and with wonders,\nand with thy great power, and with a mighty arm, and hast made thee a\nname as at this day,","We have sinned, we have done wickedly, we have acted unjustly, O\nLord our God, against all thy justices.","Let thy wrath be turned away from us:  for we are left a few among\nthe nations where thou hast scattered us.","Hear, O Lord, our prayers, and our petitions, and deliver us for\nthy own sake:  and grant that we may find favour in the sight of them\nthat have led us away:","That all the earth may know that thou art the Lord our God, and\nthat thy name is called upon Israel, and upon his posterity.","Look down upon us, O Lord, from thy holy house, and incline thy\near, and hear us.","Open thy eyes, and behold:  for the dead that are in hell, whose\nspirit is taken away from their bowels, shall not give glory and\njustice to the Lord:","But the soul that is sorrowful for the greatness of evil she hath\ndone, and goeth bowed down, and feeble, and the eyes that fail, and the\nhungry soul giveth glory and justice to thee the Lord.","For it is not for the justices of our fathers that we pour out\nour prayers, and beg mercy in thy sight, O Lord our God:","But because thou hast sent out thy wrath, and thy indignation\nupon us, as thou hast spoken by the hand of thy servants the prophets,\nsaying:","Thus saith the Lord:  Bow down your shoulder, and your neck, and\nserve the king of Babylon:  and you shall remain in the land which I\nhave given to your fathers.","But if you will not hearken to the voice of the Lord your God, to\nserve the king of Babylon:  I will cause you to depart out of the cities\nof Juda, and from without Jerusalem.","And I will take away from you the voice of mirth, and the voice\nof joy, and the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride,\nand all the land shall be without any footstep of inhabitants.","And they hearkened not to thy voice, to serve the king of\nBabylon:  and thou hast made good thy words, which thou spokest by the\nhands of thy servants the prophets, that the bones of our kings, and\nthe bones of our fathers should be removed out of their place:","And behold they are cast out to the heat of the sun, and to the\nfrost of the night:  and they have died in grievous pains, by famine,\nand by the sword, and in banishment.","And thou hast made the temple, in which thy name was called upon,\nas it is at this day, for the iniquity of the house of Israel, and the\nhouse of Juda.","And thou hast dealt with us, O Lord our God, according to all thy\ngoodness, and according to all that great mercy of thine:","As thou spokest by the hand of thy servant Moses, in the day when\nthou didst command him to write thy law before the children of Israel,","Saying:  If you will not hear my voice, this great multitude shall\nbe turned into a very small number among the nations, where I will\nscatter them:","For I know that the people will not hear me, for they are a\npeople of a stiff neck:  but they shall turn to their heart in the land\nof their captivity:","And they shall know that I am the Lord their God:  and I will give\nthem a heart, and they shall understand:  and ears, and they shall hear.","And they shall praise me in the land of their captivity, and\nshall be mindful of my name.","And they shall turn away themselves from their stiff neck, and\nfrom their wicked deeds:  for they shall remember the way of their\nfathers, that sinned against me.","And I will bring them back again into the land which I promised\nwith an oath to their fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and they\nshall be masters thereof:  and I will multiply them, and they shall not\nbe diminished.","And I will make with them another covenant that shall be\neverlasting, to be their God, and they shall be my people:  and I will\nno more remove my people, the children of Israel, out of the land that\nI have given them."]}
