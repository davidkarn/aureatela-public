{"verses":["What needeth a man to seek things that are above him, whereas he\nknoweth not what is profitable for him in his life, in all the days of\nhis pilgrimage, and the time that passeth like a shadow?  Or who can\ntell him what shall be after him under the sun?","A good name is better than precious ointments:  and the day of\ndeath than the day of one's birth.","It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to the house of\nfeasting:  for in that we are put in mind of the end of all, and the\nliving thinketh what is to come.","Anger is better than laughter:  because by the sadness of the\ncountenance the mind of the offender is corrected.","The heart of the wise is where there is mourning, and the heart of\nfools where there is mirth.","It is better to be rebuked by a wise man, than to be deceived by\nthe flattery of fools.","For as the crackling of thorns burning under a pot, so is the\nlaughter of a fool:  now this also is vanity.","Oppression troubleth the wise, and shall destroy the strength of\nhis heart.","Better is the end of a speech than the beginning.  Better is the\npatient man than the presumptuous.","Be not quickly angry:  for anger resteth in the bosom of a fool.","Say not:  What thinkest thou is the cause that former times were\nbetter than they are now?  for this manner of question is foolish.","Wisdom with riches is more profitable, and bringeth more\nadvantage to them that see the sun.","For as wisdom is a defence, so money is a defence:  but learning\nand wisdom excel in this, that they give life to him that possesseth\nthem.","Consider the works of God, that no man can correct whom he hath\ndespised.","In the good day enjoy good things, and beware beforehand of the\nevil day:  for God hath made both the one and the other, that man may\nnot find against him any just complaint.","These things also I saw in the days of my vanity:  A just man\nperisheth in his justice, and a wicked man liveth a long time in his\nwickedness.","Be not over just:  and be not more wise than is necessary, lest\nthou become stupid.","Be not overmuch wicked:  and be not foolish, lest thou die before\nthy time.","It is good that thou shouldst hold up the just, yea and from him\nwithdraw not thy hand:  for he that feareth God, neglecteth nothing.","Wisdom hath strengthened the wise more than ten princes of the\ncity.","For there is no just man upon earth, that doth good, and sinneth\nnot.","But do not apply thy heart to all words that are spoken:  lest\nperhaps thou hear thy servant reviling thee.","For thy conscience knoweth that thou also hast often spoken evil\nof others.","I have tried all things in wisdom.  I have said:  I will be wise:\nand it departed farther from me,","Much more than it was:  it is a great depth, who shall find it\nout?","I have surveyed all things with my mind, to know, and consider,\nand seek out wisdom and reason:  and to know the wickedness of the fool,\nand the error of the imprudent:","And I have found a woman more bitter than death, who is the\nhunter's snare, and her heart is a net, and her hands are bands.  He\nthat pleaseth God shall escape from her:  but he that is a sinner, shall\nbe caught by her.","Lo this have I found, said Ecclesiastes, weighing one thing after\nanother, that I might find out the account,","Which yet my soul seeketh, and I have not found it.  One man among\na thousand I have found, a woman among them all I have not found.","Only this I have found, that God made man right, and he hath\nentangled himself with an infinity of questions.  Who is as the wise\nman?  and who hath known the resolution of the word?"]}
