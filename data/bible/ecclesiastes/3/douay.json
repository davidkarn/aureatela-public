{"verses":["All things have their season, and in their times all things pass\nunder heaven.","A time to be born and a time to die.  A time to plant, and a time\nto pluck up that which is planted.","A time to kill, and a time to heal.  A time to destroy, and a time\nto build.","A time to weep, and a time to laugh.  A time to mourn, and a time\nto dance.","A time to scatter stones, and a time to gather.  A time to embrace,\nand a time to be far from embraces.","A time to get, and a time to lose.  A time to keep, and a time to\ncast away.","A time to rend, and a time to sew.  A time to keep silence, and a\ntime to speak.","A time of love, and a time of hatred.  A time of war, and a time of\npeace.","What hath man more of his labour?","I have seen the trouble, which God hath given the sons of men to\nbe exercised in it.","He hath made all things good in their time, and hath delivered\nthe world to their consideration, so that man cannot find out the work\nwhich God hath made from the beginning to the end.","And I have known that there was no better thing than to rejoice,\nand to do well in this life.","For every man that eateth and drinketh, and seeth good of his\nlabour, this is the gift of God.","I have learned that all the works which God hath made, continue\nfor ever:  we cannot add any thing, nor take away from those things\nwhich God hath made that he may be feared.","That which hath been made, the same continueth:  the things that\nshall be, have already been:  and God restoreth that which is past.","I saw under the sun in the place of judgment wickedness, and in\nthe place of justice iniquity.","And I said in my heart:  God shall judge both the just and the\nwicked, and then shall be the time of every thing.","I said in my heart concerning the sons of men, that God would\nprove them, and shew them to be like beasts.","Therefore the death of man, and of beasts is one, and the\ncondition of them both is equal:  as man dieth, so they also die:  all\nthings breathe alike, and man hath nothing more than beast:  all things\nare subject to vanity.","And all things go to one place:  of earth they were made, and into\nearth they return together.","Who knoweth if the spirit of the children of Adam ascend upward,\nand if the spirit of the beasts descend downward?","And I have found that nothing is better than for a man to rejoice\nin his work, and that this is his portion.  For who shall bring him to\nknow the things that shall be after him?"]}
