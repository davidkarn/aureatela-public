{"verses":["Speak not any thing rashly, and let not thy heart be hasty to\nutter a word before God.  For God is in heaven, and thou upon earth:\ntherefore let thy words be few.","Dreams follow many cares:  and in many words shall be found folly.","If thou hast vowed any thing to God, defer not to pay it:  for an\nunfaithful and foolish promise displeaseth him:  but whatsoever thou\nhast vowed, pay it.","And it is much better not to vow, than after a vow not to perform\nthe things promised.","Give not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin:  and say not before\nthe angel:  There is no providence:  lest God be angry at thy words, and\ndestroy all the works of thy hands.","Where there are many dreams, there are many vanities, and words\nwithout number:  but do thou fear God.","If thou shalt see the oppressions of the poor, and violent\njudgments, and justice perverted in the province, wonder not at this\nmatter:  for he that is high hath another higher, and there are others\nstill higher than these:","Moreover there is the king that reigneth over all the land subject\nto him.","A covetous man shall not be satisfied with money:  and he that\nloveth riches shall reap no fruit from them:  so this also is vanity.","Where there are great riches, there are also many to eat them.\nAnd what doth it profit the owner, but that he seeth the riches with\nhis eyes?","Sleep is sweet to a labouring man, whether he eat little or much:\nbut the fulness of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.","There is also another grievous evil, which I have seen under the\nsun:  riches kept to the hurt of the owner.","For they are lost with very great affliction:  he hath begotten a\nson, who shall be in extremity of want.","As he came forth naked from his mother's womb, so shall he\nreturn, and shall take nothing away with him of his labour.","A most deplorable evil:  as he came, so shall he return.  What then\ndoth it profit him that he hath laboured for the wind?","All the days of his life he eateth in darkness, and in many\ncares, and in misery, and sorrow.","This therefore hath seemed good to me, that a man should eat and\ndrink, and enjoy the fruit of his labour, wherewith he hath laboured\nunder the sun, all the days of his life, which God hath given him:  and\nthis is his portion.","And every man to whom God hath given riches, and substance, and\nhath given him power to eat thereof, and to enjoy his portion, and to\nrejoice of his labour:  this is the gift of God.","For he shall not much remember the days of his life, because God\nentertaineth his heart with delight."]}
