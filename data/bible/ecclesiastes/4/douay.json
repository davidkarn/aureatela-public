{"verses":["I turned myself to other things, and I saw the oppressions that\nare done under the sun, and the tears of the innocent, and they had no\ncomforter; and they were not able to resist their violence, being\ndestitute of help from any.","And I praised the dead rather than the living:","And I judged him happier than them both, that is not yet born, nor\nhath seen the evils that are done under the sun.","Again I considered all the labours of men, and I remarked that\ntheir industries are exposed to the envy of their neighbour:  so in this\nalso there is vanity, and fruitless care.","The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh,\nsaying:","Better is a handful with rest, than both hands full with labour,\nand vexation of mind.","Considering I found also another vanity under the sun:","There is but one, and he hath not a second, no child, no brother,\nand yet he ceaseth not to labour, neither are his eyes satisfied with\nriches, neither doth he reflect, saying:  For whom do I labour, and\ndefraud my soul of good things?  in this also is vanity, and a grievous\nvexation.","It is better therefore that two should be together, than one:  for\nthey have the advantage of their society:","If one fall he shall be supported by the other:  woe to him that\nis alone, for when he falleth, he hath none to lift him up.","And if two lie together, they shall warm one another:  how shall\none alone be warmed?","And if a man prevail against one, two shall withstand him:  a\nthreefold cord is not easily broken.","Better is a child that is poor and wise, than a king that is old\nand foolish, who knoweth not to foresee for hereafter.","Because out of prison and chains sometimes a man cometh forth to\na kingdom:  and another born king is consumed with poverty.","I saw all men living, that walk under the sun with the second\nyoung man, who shall rise up in his place.","The number of the people, of all that were before him is\ninfinite:  and they that shall come afterwards, shall not rejoice in\nhim:  but this also is vanity, and vexation of spirit.","Keep thy foot, when thou goest into the house of God, and draw\nnigh to hear.  For much better is obedience, than the victims of fools,\nwho know not what evil they do."]}
