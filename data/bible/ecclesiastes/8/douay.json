{"verses":["The wisdom of a man shineth in his countenance, and the most\nmighty will change his face.","I observe the mouth of the king, and the commandments of the oath\nof God.","Be not hasty to depart from his face, and do not continue in an\nevil work:  for he will do all that pleaseth him:","And his word is full of power:  neither can any man say to him:  Why\ndost thou so?","He that keepeth the commandment, shall find no evil.  The heart of\na wiser man understandeth time and answer.","There is a time and opportunity for every business, and great\naffliction for man:","Because he is ignorant of things past, and things to come he\ncannot know by any messenger.","It is not in man's power to stop the spirit, neither hath he power\nin the day of death, neither is he suffered to rest when war is at\nhand, neither shall wickedness save the wicked.","All these things I have considered, and applied my heart to all\nthe works that are done under the sun.  Sometimes one man ruleth over\nanother to his own hurt.","I saw the wicked buried:  who also when they were yet living were\nin the holy place, and were praised in the city as men of just works:\nbut this also is vanity.","For because sentence is not speedily pronounced against the evil,\nthe children of men commit evils without any fear.","But though a sinner do evil a hundred times, and by patience be\nborne withal, I know from thence that it shall be well with them that\nfear God, who dread his face.","But let it not be well with the wicked, neither let his days be\nprolonged, but as a shadow let them pass away that fear not the face of\nthe Lord.","There is also another vanity, which is done upon the earth.  There\nare just men to whom evils happen, as though they had done the works of\nthe wicked:  and there are wicked men, who are as secure as though they\nhad the deeds of the just:  but this also I judge most vain.","Therefore I commended mirth, because there was no good for a man\nunder the sun, but to eat, and drink, and be merry, and that he should\ntake nothing else with him of his labour in the days of his life, which\nGod hath given him under the sun.","And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to understand the\ndistraction that is upon earth:  for there are some that day and night\ntake no sleep with their eyes.","And I understood that man can find no reason of all those works\nof God that are done under the sun:  and the more he shall labour to\nseek, so much the less shall he find:  yea, though the wise man shall\nsay, that he knoweth it, he shall not be able to find it."]}
