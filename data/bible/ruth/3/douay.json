{"verses":["After she was returned to her mother in law, Noemi said to her:  My\ndaughter, I will seek rest for thee, and will provide that it may be\nwell with thee.","This Booz, with whose maids thou wast joined in the field, is our\nnear kinsman, and behold this night he winnoweth barley in the\nthreshingfloor.","Wash thyself therefore and anoint thee, and put on thy best\ngarments, and go down to the barnfloor:  but let not the man see thee,\ntill he shall have done eating and drinking.","And when he shall go to sleep, mark the place wherein he sleepeth:\nand thou shalt go in, and lift up the clothes wherewith he is covered\ntowards his feet, and shalt lay thyself down there:  and he will tell\nthee what thou must do.","She answered:  Whatsoever thou shalt command, I will do.","And she went down to the barnfloor, and did all that her mother in\nlaw had bid her.","And when Booz had eaten, and drunk, and was merry, he went to\nsleep by the heap of sheaves, and she came softly, and uncovering his\nfeet, laid herself down.","And behold, when it was now midnight the man was afraid, and\ntroubled:  and he saw a woman lying at his feet,","And he said to her:  Who art thou ?  And she answered:  I am Ruth,\nthy handmaid:  spread thy coverlet over thy servant, for thou art a near\nkinsman.","And he said:  Blessed art thou of the Lord, my daughter, and thy\nlatter kindness has surpassed the former:  because thou hast not\nfollowed young men either poor or rich.","Fear not therefore, but whatsoever thou shalt say to me I will do\nto thee.  For all the people that dwell within the gates of my city,\nknow that thou art a virtuous woman.","Neither do I deny myself to be near of kin, but there is another\nnearer than I.","Rest thou this night:  and when morning is come, if he will take\nthee by the right of kindred, all is well:  but if he will not, I will\nundoubtedly take thee, so the Lord liveth:  sleep till the morning.","So she slept at his feet till the night was going off.  And she\narose before men could know one another, and Booz said:  Beware lest any\nman know that thou camest hither.","And again he said:  Spread thy mantle, wherewith thou art covered,\nand hold it with both hands.  And when she spread it and held it, he\nmeasured six measures of barley, and laid it upon her.  And she carried\nit, and went into the city,","And came to her mother in law; who said to her:  What hast thou\ndone, daughter?  And she told her all that the man had done to her.","And she said:  Behold he hath given me six measures of barley:  for\nhe said:  I will not have thee return empty to thy mother in law.","And Noemi said:  Wait, my daughter, till we see what end the thing\nwill have.  For the man will not rest until he have accomplished what he\nhath said."]}
