{"verses":["In the days of the judges, when the judges ruled, there came a\nfamine in the land.  And a certain man of Bethlehem Juda, went to\nsojourn in the land of Moab with his wife and his two sons.","He was named Elimelech, and his wife Noemi:  and his two sons, the\none Mahalon, and the other Chelion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem Juda.  And\nentering into the country of Moab, they abode there.","And Elimelech the husband of Noemi died:  and she remained with her\nsons.","And they took wives of the women of Moab, of which one was called\nOrpha, and the other Ruth.  And they dwelt their ten years,","And they both died, to wit, Mahalon and Chelion:  and the woman was\nleft alone, having lost both her sons and her husband.","And she arose to go from the land of Moab to her own country, with\nboth her daughters in law:  for she had heard that the Lord had looked\nupon his people, and had given them food.","Wherefore she went forth out of the place of her sojournment, with\nboth her daughters in law:  and being now in the way to return into the\nland of Juda,","She said to them:  Go ye home to your mothers, the Lord deal\nmercifully with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me.","May he grant you to find rest in the houses of the husbands whom\nyou shall take.  And she kissed them.  And they lifted up their voice,\nand began to weep,","And to say:  We will go on with thee to thy people.","But she answered them:  Return, my daughters:  why come ye with me?\nhave I any more sons in my womb, that you may hope for husbands of me?","Return again, my daughters, and go your ways:  for I am now spent\nwith age, and not fit for wedlock.  Although I might conceive this\nnight, and bear children,","If you would wait till they were grown up, and come to man's\nestate, you would be old women before you marry.  Do not so, my\ndaughters, I beseech you:  for I am grieved the more for your distress,\nand the hand of the Lord is gone out against me.","And they lifted up their voice, and began to weep again:  Orpha\nkissed her mother in law, and returned:  Ruth stuck close to her mother\nin law.","And Noemi said to her:  Behold thy kinswoman is returned to her\npeople, and to her gods, go thou with her.","She answered:  Be not against me, to desire that I should leave\nthee and depart:  for whithersoever thou shalt go, I will go:  and where\nthou shalt dwell, I also will dwell.  Thy people shall be my people, and\nthy God my God.","The land that shall receive thee dying, in the same will I die:\nand there will I be buried.  The Lord do so and so to me, and add more\nalso, if aught but death part me and thee.","Then Noemi seeing that Ruth was steadfastly determined to go with\nher, would not be against it, nor persuade her any more to return to\nher friends:","So they went together, and came to Bethlehem.  And when they were\ncome into the city, the report was quickly spread among all:  and the\nwomen said:  This is that Noemi.","But she said to them:  Call me not Noemi (that is, beautiful,) but\ncall me Mara (that is, bitter), for the Almighty hath quite filled me\nwith bitterness.","I went out full and the Lord hath brought me back empty.  Why then\ndo you call me Noemi, whom the Lord hath humbled, and the Almighty hath\nafflicted?","So Noemi came with Ruth, the Moabitess, her daughter in law, from\nthe land of her sojournment:  and returned into Bethlehem, in the\nbeginning of the barley harvest."]}
