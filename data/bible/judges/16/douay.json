{"verses":["He went also into Gaza, and saw there a woman, a harlot, and went\nin unto her.","And when the Philistines had heard this, and it was noised about\namong them, that Samson was come into the city, they surrounded him,\nsetting guards at the gate of the city, and watching there all the\nnight in silence, that in the morning they might kill him as he went\nout.","But Samson slept till midnight, and then rising, he took both the\ndoors of the gate, with the posts thereof and the bolt, and laying them\non his shoulders, carried them up to the top of the hill, which looketh\ntowards Hebron.","After this he loved a woman, who dwelt in the valley of Sorec,\nand she was called Dalila.","And the princes of the Philistines came to her, and said:  Deceive\nhim, and learn of him wherein his great strength lieth, and how we may\nbe able to overcome him, to bind and afflict him:  which if thou shalt\ndo, we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.","And Dalila said to Samson:  Tell me, I beseech thee, wherein thy\ngreatest strength lieth, and what it is, wherewith if thou wert bound,\nthou couldst not break loose.","And Samson answered her:  If I shall be bound with seven cords,\nmade of sinews not yet dry, but still moist, I shall be weak like other\nmen.","And the princes of the Philistines brought unto her seven cords,\nsuch as he spoke of, with which she bound him;","Men lying privately in wait with her, and in the chamber,\nexpecting the event of the thing, and she cried out to him:  The\nPhilistines are upon thee, Samson.  And he broke the bands, as a man\nwould break a thread of tow twined with spittle, when it smelleth the\nfire:  so it was not known wherein his strength lay.","And Dalila said to him:  Behold thou hast mocked me, and hast\ntold me a false thing:  but now at least tell me wherewith thou mayest\nbe bound.","And he answered her:  If I shall be bound with new ropes, that\nwere never in work, I shall be weak and like other men.","Dalila bound him again with these, and cried out:  The\nPhilistines are upon thee, Samson, there being an ambush prepared for\nhim in the chamber.  But he broke the bands like threads of webs.","And Dalila said to him again:  How long dost thou deceive me, and\ntell me lies?  Shew me wherewith thou mayest be bound.  And Samson\nanswered her:  If thou plattest the seven locks of my head with a lace,\nand tying them round about a nail, fastenest it in the ground, I shall\nbe weak.","And when Dalila had done this, she said to him:  The Philistines\nare upon thee, Samson.  And awaking out of his sleep, he drew out the\nnail with the hairs and the lace.","And Dalila said to him:  How dost thou say thou lovest me, when\nthy mind is not with me?  Thou hast told me lies these three times, and\nwouldst not tell me wherein thy greatest strength lieth.","And when she pressed him much, and continually hung upon him for\nmany days, giving him no time to rest, his soul fainted away, and was\nwearied even unto death.","Then opening the truth of the thing, he said to her:  The razor\nhath never come upon my head, for I am a Nazarite, that is to say,\nconsecrated to God from my mother's womb:  If my head be shaven, my\nstrength shall depart from me, and I shall become weak, and shall be\nlike other men.","Then seeing that he had discovered to her all his mind, she sent\nto the princes of the Philistines, saying:  Come up this once more, for\nnow he hath opened his heart to me.  And they went up, taking with them\nthe money which they had promised.","But she made him sleep upon her knees, and lay his head in her\nbosom.  And she called a barber and shaved his seven locks, and began to\ndrive him away, and thrust him from her:  for immediately his strength\ndeparted from him.","And she said:  The Philistines are upon thee, Samson.  And awaking\nfrom sleep, he said in his mind:  I will go out as I did before, and\nshake myself, not knowing that the Lord was departed from him.","Then the Philistines seized upon him, and forthwith pulled out\nhis eyes, and led him bound in chains to Gaza, and shutting him up in\nprison made him grind.","And now his hair began to grow again,","And the princes of the Philistines assembled together, to offer\ngreat sacrifices to Dagon their god, and to make merry, saying:  Our god\nhath delivered our enemy Samson into our hands.","And the people also seeing this, praised their god, and said the\nsame:  Our god hath delivered our adversary into our hands, him that\ndestroyed our country, and killed very many.","And rejoicing in their feasts, when they had now taken their\ngood cheer, they commanded that Samson should be called, and should\nplay before them.  And being brought out of prison, he played before\nthem; and they made him stand between two pillars.","And he said to the lad that guided his steps:  Suffer me to touch\nthe pillars which support the whole house, and let me lean upon them,\nand rest a little.","Now the house was full of men and women, and all the princes of\nthe Philistines were there.  Moreover about three thousand persons of\nboth sexes, from the roof and the higher part of the house, were\nbeholding Samson's play.","But he called upon the Lord, saying:  O Lord God remember me, and\nrestore to me now my former strength, O my God, that I may revenge\nmyself on my enemies, and for the loss of my two eyes I may take one\nrevenge.","And laying hold on both the pillars on which the house rested,\nand holding the one with his right hand, and the other with his left,","He said:  Let me die with the Philistines.  And when he had\nstrongly shook the pillars, the house fell upon all the princes, and\nthe rest of the multitude, that was there:  and he killed many more at\nhis death, than he had killed before in his life.","And his brethren and all his kindred, going down took his body,\nand buried it between Saraa and Esthaol, in the buryingplace of his\nfather Manue:  and he judged Israel twenty years."]}
