{"verses":["Then Jerobaal, who is the same as Gedeon, rising up early, and all\nthe people with him, came to the fountain that is called Harad.  Now the\ncamp of Madian was in the valley, on the north side of the high hill.","And the Lord said to Gedeon:  The people that are with thee are\nmany, and Madian shall not be delivered into their hands:  lest Israel\nshould glory against me, and say:  I was delivered by my own strength.","Speak to the people, and proclaim in the hearing of all:  Whosoever\nis fearful and timorous, let him return.  So two and twenty thousand men\nwent away from Mount Galaad and returned home, and only ten thousand\nremained.","And the Lord said to Gedeon:  The people are still too many, bring\nthem to the waters, and there I will try them:  and of whom I shall say\nto thee, This shall go with thee, let him go:  whom I shall forbid to\ngo, let him return.","And when the people were come down to the waters, the Lord said to\nGedeon:  They that shall lap the water with their tongues, as dogs are\nwont to lap, thou shalt set apart by themselves:  but they that shall\ndrink bowing down their knees, shall be on the other side.","And the number of them that had lapped water; casting it with the\nhand to their mouth, was three hundred men:  and all the rest of the\nmultitude had drunk kneeling.","And the Lord said to Gedeon:  By the three hundred men, that lapped\nwater, I will save you, and deliver Madian into thy hand:  but let all\nthe rest of the people return to their place.","So taking victuals and trumpets according to their number, he\nordered all the rest of the multitude to depart to their tents:  and he\nwith the three hundred gave himself to the battle.  Now the camp of\nMadia was beneath him in the valley.","The same night the Lord said to him:  Arise, and go down into the\ncamp:  because I have delivered them into thy hand.","But if thou be afraid to go alone, let Phara, thy servant, go\ndown with thee.","And when thou shalt hear what they are saying, then shall thy\nhands be strengthened, and thou shalt go down more secure to the\nenemies' camp.  And he went down with Phara his servant, into part of\nthe camp, where was the watch of men in arms.","But Madian and Amalec, and all the eastern people, lay scattered\nin the valley, as a multitude of locusts:  their camels also were\ninnumerable, as the sand that lieth on the sea shore.","And when Gedeon was come, one told his neighbour a dream:  and in\nthis manner related what he had seen:  I dreamt a dream, and it seemed\nto me as if a hearth cake of barley bread rolled and came down into the\ncamp of Madian:  and when it was come to a tent, it struck it, and beat\nit down flat to the ground.","He to whom he spoke, answered:  This is nothing else but the sword\nof Gedeon, the son of Joas, a man of Israel.  For the Lord hath\ndelivered Madian, and all their camp into his hand.","And when Gedeon had heard the dream, and the interpretation\nthereof, he adored:  and returned to the camp of Israel, and said:\nArise, for the Lord hath delivered the camp of Madian into our hands.","And he divided the three hundred men into three parts, and gave\nthem trumpets in their hands, and empty pitchers, and lamps within the\npitchers.","And he said to them:  What you shall see me do, do you the same:  I\nwill go into one part of the camp, and do you as I shall do.","When the trumpet shall sound in my hand, do you also blow the\ntrumpets on every side of the camp, and shout together to the Lord and\nto Gedeon.","And Gedeon, and the three hundred men that were with him, went\ninto part of the camp, at the beginning of the midnight watch, and the\nwatchmen being alarmed, they began to sound their trumpets, and to clap\nthe pitchers one against another.","And when they sounded their trumpets in three places round about\nthe camp, and had broken their pitchers, they held their lamps in their\nleft hands, and with their right hands the trumpets which they blew,\nand they cried out:  The sword of the Lord and of Gedeon:","Standing every man in his place round about the enemies' camp.  So\nall the camp was troubled, and crying out and howling, they fled away:","And the three hundred men nevertheless persisted sounding the\ntrumpets.  And the Lord sent the sword into all the camp, and they\nkilled one another,","Fleeing as far as Bethsetta, and the border of Abelmahula, in\nTebbath.  But the men of Israel, shouting from Nephthali, and Aser, and\nfrom all Manasses, pursued after Madian.","And Gedeon sent messengers into all Mount Ephraim, saying:  Come\ndown to meet Madian, and take the waters before them to Bethbera and\nthe Jordan.  And all Ephraim shouted, and took the waters before them\nand the Jordan as far as Bethbera.","And having taken two men of Madian, Oreb and Zeb:  Oreb they slew\nin the rock of Oreb, and Zeb in the winepress of Zeb.  And they pursued\nMadian, carrying the heads of Oreb and Zeb to Gedeon, beyond the waters\nof the Jordan."]}
