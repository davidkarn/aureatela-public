And the next day it was told us that the cities[fn-4-P450_84604:7-nf] of the two kings with a great host were coming against us. I therefore and Dan reigned ourselves to be Amorites, and went as allies into their city. And in the depth of night our brethren came, and we opened to them the gates; and we destroyed all the men and their substance, and we took for a prey all that was theirs, and their three walls we cast down. And we drew near to Thamna,[fn-4-P451_85116:8-nf] where was all the refuge of the hostile kings. Then having received hurt I was wroth, and charged upon them to the brow of the hill; and they slang at me with stones and darts; and had not Dan my brother aided me, they would have been able to slay me. We came upon them therefore with wrath, and they all fled; and passing by another way, they besought my father, and he made peace with them, and we did to them no hurt, but made a truce with them, and restored to them all the captives. And I built Thamna, and my father built Rhambael.[fn-4-P452_86223:9-nf] I was twenty years old when this war befell, and the Canaanites feared me and my brethren.","title":"IV.-The Testament of Judah Concerning Fortitude, and Love of Money, and Fornication.","author":"The Twelve Patriarchs"},{"chapter":2,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_14_on_the_spirit_and_the_letter","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"73","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"After reading the short treatises which I lately drew up for you, my beloved son Marcellinus, about the baptism of infants, and the perfection of man's righteousness, - how that no one in this life seems either to have attained or to be likely to attain to it, except only the Mediator, who bore humanity in the likeness of sinful flesh, without any sin whatever, - you wrote me in answer that you were embarrassed by the point which I advanced in the second book,[fn-12-P1263_645351:1-nf] that it was possible for a man to be without sin, if he wanted not the will, and was assisted by the aid of God; and yet that except One in whom \"all shall be made alive,\"[fn-12-P1264_645569:2-nf] no one has ever lived or will live by whom this perfection has been attained whilst living here.

I said: \"If I were asked whether it be possible for a man to be without sin in this life, I should allow the possibility, by the grace of God, and his own free will; for I should have no doubt that the free will itself is of God's grace,-that is, has its place among the gifts of God,-not only as to its existence, but also in respect of its goodness; that is, that it applies itself to doing the commandments of God.

But it is now time for us to raise the standard of Joshua's chastity. It is written that Moses had a wife. Now Moses is interpreted both by our Lord and by the Apostle to mean the law:[fn-62-P6279_1921028:124-nf] \"They have Moses and the prophets.\" And[fn-62-P6280_1921092:125-nf] \"Death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adam's transgression.\" And no one doubts that in both passages Moses signifies the law. We read that Moses, that is the law, had a wife: shew me then in the same way that Joshua the son of Nun had either wife or children, and if you can do so, I will confess that I am beaten. He certainly received the fairest spot in the division of the land of Judah, and died, not in the twenties, which are ever unlucky in Scripture-by them are reckoned the years of[fn-62-P6281_1921661:126-nf] Jacob's service,[fn-62-P6282_1921700:127-nf] the price of Joseph, and[fn-62-P6283_1921749:128-nf] sundry presents which Esau who was fond of them received-but in the[fn-62-P6284_1921840:129-nf] tens, whose praises we have often sung; and he was buried in[fn-62-P6285_1921961:130-nf] Thamnath Sare, that is, most perfect sovereignty, or among those of a new covering, to signify the crowds of virgins, covered by the Saviour's aid on Mount Ephraim, that is, the fruitful mountain; on the north of the Mountain of Gaash, which is, being interpreted, disturbance: for[fn-62-P6286_1922757:131-nf] \"Mount Sion is on the sides of the north, the city of the Great King,\" is ever exposed to hatred, and in every trial says[fn-62-P6287_1922955:132-nf] \"But my feet had well nigh slipped.\" The book which bears the name of Joshua ends with his burial. Again in the book of Judges we read of him as though he had risen and come to life again, and by way of summary his works are extolled. We read too[fn-62-P6288_1923224:133-nf] \"So Joshua sent the people away, every man unto his inheritance, that they might possess the land.\" And \"Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua,\" and so on. There immediately follows: \"And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being an hundred and ten years old.\" Moses, moreover, only saw the land of promise; he could not enter: and[fn-62-P6289_1923605:134-nf] \"he died in the land of Moab, and the Lord buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.\" Let us compare the burial of the two: Moses died in the land of Moab, Joshua in the land of Judaea. The former was buried in a valley over against the house of Phogor, which is, being interpreted, reproach (for the Hebrew Phogor corresponds to Priapus[fn-62-P6290_1924044:135-nf] ); the latter in Mount Ephraim on the north of Mount Gaash. And in the simple expressions of the sacred Scriptures there is always a more subtle meaning. The Jews gloried in children and child-bearing; and the barren woman, who had not offspring in Israel, was accursed; but blessed was he whose seed was in Sion, and his family in Jerusalem; and part of the highest blessing was,[fn-62-P6291_1924564:136-nf] \"Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine, in the innermost parts of thy house, thy children like olive plants, round about thy table.\" Therefore his grave is described as placed in a valley over against the house of an idol which was in a special sense consecrated to lust. But we who fight under Joshua our leader, even to the present day know not where Moses was buried. For we despise Phogor, and all his shame, knowing that they who are in the flesh cannot please God. And the Lord before the flood had said[fn-62-P6292_1925097:137-nf] \"My spirit shall not abide in man for ever, for that he also is flesh.\" Wherefore, when Moses died, the people of Israel mourned for him; but Joshua like one on his way to victory was unmourned. For marriage ends at death; virginity thereafter begins to wear the crown.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_45_scorpiace_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"26","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Nor should I think it needful to discuss whether God pursues a worthy course in forbidding His own name and honour to be given over to a lie, or does so in not consenting that such as He has plucked from the maze of false religion should return again to Egypt, or does so in not suffering to depart from Him them whom He has chosen for Himself.
