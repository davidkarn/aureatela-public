{"verses":["And an angel of the Lord went up from Galgal to the place of\nweepers, and said:  I made you go out of Egypt, and have brought you\ninto the land for which I swore to your fathers:  and I promised that I\nwould not make void my covenant with you for ever:","On condition that you should not make a league with the\ninhabitants of this land, but should throw down their altars:  and you\nwould not hear my voice:  why have you done this?","Wherefore I would not destroy them from before your face; that you\nmay have enemies, and their gods may be your ruin.","And when the angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the\nchildren of Israel:  they lifted up their voice, and wept.","And the name of that place was called, The place of weepers, or of\ntears:  and there they offered sacrifices to the Lord.","And Josue sent away the people, and the children of Israel went\nevery one to his own possession to hold it:","And they served the Lord all his days, and the days of the\nancients, that lived a long time after him, and who knew all the works\nof the Lord, which he had done for Israel.","And Josue, the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being a\nhundred and ten years old;","And they buried him in the borders of his possession in\nThamnathsare, in Mount Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaas.","And all that generation was gathered to their fathers:  and there\narose others that knew not the Lord and the works which he had done for\nIsrael.","And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and\nthey served Baalim","And they left the Lord, the God of their fathers, who had brought\nthem out of the land of Egypt:  and they followed strange gods, and the\ngods of the people that dwelt round about them, and they adored them:\nand they provoked the Lord to anger,","Forsaking him, and serving Baal and Astaroth","And the Lord being angry against Israel, delivered them into the\nhands of plunderers:  who took them and sold them to their enemies, that\ndwelt round about:  neither could they stand against their enemies:","But whithersoever they meant to go, the hand of the Lord was upon\nthem, as he had said, and as he had sworn to them:  and they were\ngreatly distressed.","And the Lord raised up judges, to deliver them from the hands of\nthose that oppressed them:  but they would not hearken to them,","Committing fornication with strange gods, and adoring them.  They\nquickly forsook the way, in which their fathers had walked:  and hearing\nthe commandments of the Lord, they did all things contrary.","And when the Lord raised them up judges, in their days, he was\nmoved to mercy, and heard the groanings of the afflicted, and delivered\nthem from the slaughter of the oppressors.","But after the judge was dead, they returned, and did much worse\nthings than their fathers had done, following strange gods, serving\nthem, and adoring them.  They left not their own inventions, and the\nstubborn way, by which they were accustomed to walk.","And the wrath of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he\nsaid:  Behold this nation hath made void my covenant, which I had made\nwith their fathers, and hath despised to hearken to my voice:","I also will not destroy the nations which Josue left when he\ndied:","That through them I may try Israel, whether they will keep the\nway of the Lord, and walk in it, as their fathers kept it, or not.","The Lord therefore left all these nations, and would not quickly\ndestroy them, neither did he deliver them into the hands of Josue."]}
