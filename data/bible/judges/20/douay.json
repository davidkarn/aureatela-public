{"verses":["Then all the children of Israel went out, and gathered together\nas one man, from Dan to Bersabee, with the land of Galaad, to the Lord\nin Maspha:","And all the chiefs of the people, and all the tribes of Israel,\nmet together in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred\nthousand footmen fit for war.","(Nor were the children of Benjamin ignorant that the children of\nIsrael were come up to Maspha.)  And the Levite, the husband of the\nwoman that was killed being asked, how so great a wickedness had been\ncommitted,","Answered:  I came into Gabaa, of Benjamin, with my wife, and there\nI lodged:","And behold the men of that city, in the night beset the house\nwherein I was, intending to kill me, and abused my wife with an\nincredible fury of lust, so that at last she died.","And I took her and cut her in pieces, and sent the parts into all\nthe borders of your possession:  because there never was so heinous a\ncrime, and so great an abomination committed in Israel.","You are all here, O children of Israel, determine what you ought\nto do.","And all the people standing, answered as by the voice of one man:\nWe will not return to our tents, neither shall any one of us go into\nhis own house:","But this we will do in common against Gabaa:","We will take ten men of a hundred out of all the tribes of\nIsrael, and a hundred out of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten\nthousand, to bring victuals for the army, that we may fight against\nGabaa of Benjamin, and render to it for its wickedness, what it\ndeserveth.","And all Israel were gathered together against the city, as one\nman, with one mind, and one counsel:","And they sent messengers to all the tribe of Benjamin, to say to\nthem:  Why hath so great an abomination been found among you?","Deliver up the men of Gabaa, that have committed this heinous\ncrime, that they may die, and the evil may be taken away out of Israel.\nBut they would not hearken to the proposition of their brethren the\nchildren of Israel:","But out of all the cities which were of their lot, they gathered\nthemselves together into Gabaa, to aid them, and to fight against the\nwhole people of Israel.","And there were found of Benjamin five and twenty thousand men\nthat drew the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gabaa,","Who were seven hundred most valiant men, fighting with the left\nhand as well as with the right:  and slinging stones so sure that they\ncould hit even a hair, and not miss by the stone's going on either\nside.","Of the men of Israel also, beside the children of Benjamin, were\nfound four hundred thousand that drew swords and were prepared to\nfight.","And they arose and came to the house of God, that is, to Silo:\nand they consulted God, and said:  Who shall be in our army the first to\ngo to the battle against the children of Benjamin?  And the Lord\nanswered them:  Let Juda be your leader.","And forthwith the children of Israel rising in the morning,\ncamped by Gabaa:","And going out from thence to fight against Benjamin, began to\nassault the city.","And the children of Benjamin coming out of Gabaa slew of the\nchildren of Israel that day two and twenty thousand men.","Again Israel, trusting in their strength and their number, set\ntheir army in array in the same place, where they had fought before:","Yet so that they first went up and wept before the Lord until\nnight:  and consulted him and said:  Shall I go out any more to fight\nagainst the children of Benjamin my brethren or not?  And he answered\nthem:  Go up against them, and join battle.","And when the children of Israel went out the next day to fight\nagainst the children of Benjamin,","The children of Benjamin sallied forth out of the gates of\nGabaa:  and meeting them, made so great a slaughter of them, as to kill\neighteen thousand men that drew the sword.","Wherefore all the children of Israel came to the house of God,\nand sat and wept before the Lord:  and they fasted that day till the\nevening, and offered to him holocausts, and victims of peace offerings,","And inquired of him concerning their state.  At that time the ark\nof the covenant of the Lord was there,","And Phinees, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, was over the\nhouse.  So they consulted the Lord, and said:  Shall we go out any more\nto fight against the children of Benjamin, our brethren, or shall we\ncease?  And the Lord said to them:  Go up, for to morrow I will deliver\nthem into your hands.","And the children of Israel set ambushes round about the city of\nGabaa:","And they drew up their army against Benjamin the third time, as\nthey had done the first and second.","And the children of Benjamin boldly issued out of the city, and\nseeing their enemies flee, pursued them a long way, so as to wound and\nkill some of them, as they had done the first and second day, whilst\nthey fled by two highways, whereof one goeth up to Bethel and the other\nto Gabaa, and they slew about thirty men:","For they thought to cut them off as they did before.  But they\nartfully feigning a flight, designed to draw them away from the city,\nand by their seeming to flee, to bring them to the highways aforesaid.","Then all the children of Israel rising up out of the places\nwhere they were, set their army in battle array, in the place which is\ncalled Baalthamar.  The ambushes also, which were about the city, began\nby little and little to come forth,","And to march from the west side of the city.  And other ten\nthousand men chosen out of all Israel, attacked the inhabitants of the\ncity.  And the battle grew hot against the children of Benjamin:  and\nthey understood not that present death threatened them on every side.","And the Lord defeated them before the children of Israel, and\nthey slew of them in that day five and twenty thousand, and one\nhundred, all fighting men, and that drew the sword.","But the children of Benjamin, when they saw themselves to be too\nweak, began to flee.  Which the children of Israel seeing, gave them\nplace to flee, that they might come to the ambushes that were prepared,\nwhich they had set near the city.","And they that were in ambush arose on a sudden out of their\ncoverts, and whilst Benjamin turned their backs to the slayers, went\ninto the city, and smote it with the edge of the sword.","Now the children of Israel had given a sign to them, whom they\nhad laid in ambushes, that after they had taken the city, they should\nmake a fire:  that by the smoke rising on high, they might shew that the\ncity was taken.","And when the children of Israel saw this in the battle, (for the\nchildren of Benjamin thought they fled, and pursued them vigorously,\nkilling thirty men of their army)","And perceived, as it were, a pillar of smoke rise up from the\ncity; and Benjamin looking back, saw that the city was taken, and that\nthe flames ascended on high:","They that before had made as if they fled, turning their faces,\nstood bravely against them.  Which the children of Benjamin seeing,\nturned their backs,","And began to go towards the way of the desert, the enemy\npursuing them thither also.  And they that fired the city came also out\nto meet them.","And so it was, that they were slain on both sides by the\nenemies, and there was no rest of their men dying.  They fell and were\nbeaten down on the east side of the city of Gabaa.","And they that were slain in the same place, were eighteen\nthousand men, all most valiant soldiers.","And when they that remained of Benjamin saw this, they fled into\nthe wilderness, and made towards the rock that is called Remmon.  In\nthat flight also, as they were straggling, and going different ways;\nthey slew of them five thousand men.  And as they went farther, they\nstill pursued them, and slew also other two thousand.","And so it came to pass, that all that were slain of Benjamin, in\ndivers places, were five and twenty thousand fighting men, most valiant\nfor war.","And there remained of all the number of Benjamin only six\nhundred men that were able to escape, and flee to the wilderness:  and\nthey abode in the rock Remmon four months.","But the children of Israel returning, put all the remains of the\ncity to the sword, both men and beasts, and all the cities and villages\nof Benjamin were consumed with devouring flames."]}
