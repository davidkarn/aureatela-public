{"verses":["There was at that time a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was\nMichas.","Who said to his mother:  The eleven hundred pieces of silver,\nwhich thou hadst put aside for thyself, and concerning which thou didst\nswear in my hearing, behold I have, and they are with me.  And she said\nto him.  Blessed be my son by the Lord.","So he restored them to his mother, who said to him:  I have\nconsecrated and vowed this silver to the Lord, that my son may receive\nit at my hand, and make a graven and a molten god; so now I deliver it\nto thee.","And he restored them to his mother:  and she took two hundred\npieces of silver and gave them to the silversmith, to make of them a\ngraven and a molten God, which was in the house of Michas.","And he separated also therein a little temple for the god, and\nmade an ephod, and theraphim, that is to say, a priestly garment, and\nidols:  and he filled the hand of one of his sons, and he became his\npriest.","In those days there was no king in Israel, but every one did that\nwhich seemed right to himself.","There was also another young man of Bethlehem Juda, of the\nkindred thereof:  and he was a Levite, and dwelt there.","Now he went out from the city of Bethlehem, and desired to\nsojourn wheresoever he should find it convenient for him.  And when he\nwas come to mount Ephraim, as he was on his journey, and had turned\naside a little into the house of Michas,","He was asked by him whence he came.  And he answered:  I am a\nLevite of Bethlehem Juda, and I am going to dwell where I can, and\nwhere I shall find a place to my advantage.","And Michas said:  Stay with me, and be unto me a father and a\npriest, and I will give thee every year ten pieces of silver, and a\ndouble suit of apparel, and thy victuals.","He was content, and abode with the man, and was unto him as one\nof his sons.","And Michas filled his hand, and had the young man with him for\nhis priest, saying:","Now I know God will do me good, since I have a priest of the\nrace of the Levites."]}
