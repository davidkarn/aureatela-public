{"verses":["And the men of Ephraim said to him:  What is this that thou meanest\nto do, that thou wouldst not call us, when thou wentest to fight\nagainst Madian?  And they chid him sharply, and almost offered violence.","And he answered them:  What could I have done like to that which\nyou have done?  Is not one bunch of grapes of Ephraim better than the\nvintages of Abiezer?","The Lord hath delivered into your hands the princes of Madian,\nOreb and Zeb:  what could I have done like to what you have done?  And\nwhen he had said this, their spirit was appeased, with which they\nswelled against him.","And when Gedeon was come to the Jordan, he passed over it with the\nthree hundred men that were with him:  who were so weary that they could\nnot pursue after them that fled.","And he said to the men of Soccoth:  Give, I beseech you, bread to\nthe people that is with me, for they are faint:  that we may pursue\nZebee, and Salmana, the kings of Madian.","The princes of Soccoth answered:  Peradventure the palms of the\nhands of Zebee and Salmana are in thy hand, and therefore thou\ndemandest that we should give bread to thy army.","And he said to them:  When the Lord therefore shall have delivered\nZebee and Salmana into my hands, I will thresh your flesh with the\nthorns and briers of the desert.","And going up from thence, he came to Phanuel:  and he spoke the\nlike things to the men of that place.  And they also answered him, as\nthe men of Soccoth had answered.","He said, therefore, to them also:  When I shall return a conqueror\nin peace, I will destroy this tower.","But Zebee and Salmana were resting with all their army.  For\nfifteen thousand men were left of all the troops of the eastern people,\nand one hundred and twenty thousand warriors that drew the sword were\nslain.","And Gedeon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents, on the\neast of Nobe and Jegbaa, and smote the camp of the enemies, who were\nsecure, and suspected no hurt.","And Zebee and Salmana fled, and Gedeon pursued and took them, all\ntheir host being put in confusion.","And returning from the battle before the sun rising,","He took a boy of the men of Soccoth:  and he asked him the names\nof the princes and ancients of Soccoth, and he described unto him\nseventy-seven men.","And he came to Soccoth, and said to them:  Behold Zebee, and\nSalmana, concerning whom you upbraided me, saying:  Peradventure the\nhands of Zebee and Salmana are in thy hands, and therefore thou\ndemandest that we should give bread to the men that are weary and\nfaint.","So he took the ancients of the city, and thorns and briers of the\ndesert, and tore them with the same, and cut in pieces the men of\nSoccoth.","And he demolished the tower of Phanuel, and slew the men of the\ncity.","And he said to Zebee and Salmana:  What manner of men were they,\nwhom you slew in Thabor?  They answered:  They were like thee, and one of\nthem as the son of a king.","He answered them:  They were my brethren, the sons of my mother.\nAs the Lord liveth, if you had saved them, I would not kill you.","And he said to Jether, his eldest son:  Arise, and slay them.  But\nhe drew not his sword:  for he was afraid, being but yet a boy.","And Zebee and Salmana said:  Do thou rise and run upon us:  because\nthe strength of a man is according to his age:  Gedeon rose up, and slew\nZebee and Salmana:  and he took the ornaments and bosses, with which the\nnecks of the camels of kings are wont to be adorned.","And all the men of Israel said to Gedeon:  Rule thou over us, and\nthy son, and thy son's son:  because thou hast delivered us from the\nhand of Madian.","And he said to them:  I will not rule over you, neither shall my\nson rule over you, but the Lord shall rule over you.","And he said to them:  I desire one request of you:  Give me the\nearlets of your spoils.  For the Ismaelites were accustomed to wear\ngolden earlets.","They answered:  We will give them most willingly.  And spreading a\nmantle on the ground, they cast upon it the earlets of the spoils.","And the weight of the earlets that he requested, was a thousand\nseven hundred sicles of gold, besides the ornaments, and jewels, and\npurple raiment, which the kings of Madian were wont to use, and besides\nthe golden chains that were about the camels necks.","And Gedeon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city Ephra.\nAnd all Israel committed fornication with it, and it became a ruin to\nGedeon, and to all his house.","But Madian was humbled before the children of Israel, neither\ncould they any more lift up their heads:  but the land rested for forty\nyears, while Gedeon presided.","So Jerobaal, the son of Joas, went and dwelt in his own house:","And he had seventy sons, who came out of his thigh, for he had\nmany wives.","And his concubine, that he had in Sichem, bore him a son, whose\nname was Abimelech.","And Gedeon, the son of Joas died in a good old age, and was\nburied in the sepulchre of his father, in Ephra, of the family of Ezri.","But after Gedeon was dead, the children of Israel turned again,\nand committed fornication with Baalim.  And they made a covenant with\nBaal, that he should be their god:","And they remembered not the Lord their God, who delivered them\nout of the hands of all their enemies round about:","Neither did they shew mercy to the house of Jerobaal Gedeon,\naccording to all the good things he had done to Israel."]}
