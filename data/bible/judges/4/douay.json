{"verses":["And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord\nafter the death of Aod:","And the Lord delivered them up into the hands of Jabin, king of\nChanaan, who reigned in Asor:  and he had a general of his army named\nSisara, and he dwelt in Haroseth of the Gentiles.","And the children of Israel cried to the Lord:  for he had nine\nhundred chariots set with scythes and for twenty years had grievously\noppressed them.","And there was at that time Debbora, a prophetess, the wife of\nLapidoth, who judged the people.","And she sat under a palm tree, which was called by her name,\nbetween Rama and Bethel, in Mount Ephraim:  and the children of Israel\ncame up to her for all judgment.","And she sent and called Barac, the Son of Abinoem, out of Cedes,\nin Nephthali:  and she said to him:  The Lord God of Israel hath\ncommanded thee:  Go, and lead an army to Mount Thabor, and thou shalt\ntake with thee ten thousand fighting men of the children of Nephthali,\nand of the children of Zabulon:","And I will bring unto thee in the place of the torrent Cison,\nSisara, the general of Jabin's army, and his chariots, and all his\nmultitude, and will deliver them into thy hand.","And Barac said to her:  If thou wilt come with me, I will go:  if\nthou wilt not come with me, I will not go.","She said to him:  I will go, indeed, with thee, but at this time\nthe victory shall not be attributed to thee, because Sisara shall be\ndelivered into the hand of a woman.  Debbora therefore arose, and went\nwith Barac to Cedes.","And he called unto him Zabulon and Nephthali, and went up with\nten thousand fighting men, having Debbora in his company.","Now Haber, the Cinite, had some time before departed from the\nrest of the Cinites, his brethren, the sons of Hobab, the kinsman of\nMoses:  and had pitched his tents unto the valley, which is called\nSennim, and was near Cedes.","And it was told Sisara, that Barac, the son of Abinoem, was gone\nup to Mount Thabor:","And he gathered together his nine hundred chariots armed with\nscythes, and all his army, from Haroseth of the Gentiles, to the\ntorrent Cison.","And Debbora said to Barac:  Arise, for this is the day wherein the\nLord hath delivered Sisara into thy hands:  behold, he is thy leader.\nAnd Barac went down from Mount Thabor, and ten thousand fighting men\nwith him.","And the Lord struck a terror into Sisara, and all his chariots,\nand all his multitude, with the edge of the sword, at the sight of\nBarac; insomuch, that Sisara leaping down from off his chariot, fled\naway on foot,","And Barac pursued after the fleeing chariots, and the army, unto\nHaroseth of the Gentiles; and all the multitude of the enemies was\nutterly destroyed.","But Sisara fleeing, came to the tent of Jahel, the wife of Haber,\nthe Cinite, for there was peace between Jabin, the king of Asor, and\nthe house of Haber, the Cinite.","And Jahel went forth to meet Sisara, and said to him:  Come in to\nme, my lord; come in, fear not.  He went into her tent, and being\ncovered by her with a cloak,","Said to her:  Give me, I beseech thee, a little water, for I am\nvery thirsty.  She opened a bottle of milk, and gave him to drink, and\ncovered him.","And Sisara said to her:  Stand before the door of the tent, and\nwhen any shall come and inquire of thee, saying:  Is there any man here?\nthou shalt say:  There is none.","So Jahel, Haber's wife, took a nail of the tent, and taking also\na hammer:  and going in softly, and with silence, she put the nail upon\nthe temples of his head, and striking it with the hammer, drove it\nthrough his brain fast into the ground:  and so passing from deep sleep\nto death, he fainted away and died.","And behold, Barac came pursuing after Sisara:  and Jahel went out\nto meet him, and said to him:  Come, and I will shew thee the man whom\nthou seekest.  And when he came into her tent, he saw Sisara lying dead,\nand the nail fastened in his temples.","So God that day humbled Jabin, the king of Chanaan, before the\nchildren of Israel:","Who grew daily stronger, and with a mighty hand overpowered\nJabin, king of Chanaan, till they quite destroyed him."]}
