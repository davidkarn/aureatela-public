{"verses":["There was at that time Jephte, the Galaadite, a most valiant man,\nand a warrior, the son of a woman that was a harlot, and his father was\nGalaad.","Now Galaad had a wife of whom he had sons:  who, after they were\ngrown up, thrust out Jephte, saying:  Thou canst not inherit in the\nhouse of our father, because thou art born of another mother.","Then he fled and avoided them, and dwelt in the land of Tob:  and\nthere were gathered to him needy men and robbers, and they followed him\nas their prince.","In those days the children of Ammon made war against Israel.","And as they pressed hard upon them, the ancients of Galaad went\nto fetch Jephte out of the land of Tob to help them:","And they said to him:  Come thou, and be our prince, and fight\nagainst the children of Ammon.","And he answered them:  Are not you the men that hated me, and cast\nme out of my father's house, and now you are come to me, constrained by\nnecessity?","And the princes of Galaad said to Jephte:  For this cause we are\nnow come to thee, that thou mayst go with us, and fight against the\nchildren of Ammon, and be head over all the inhabitants of Galaad.","Jephte also said to them:  If you be come to me sincerely, that I\nshould fight for you against the children of Ammon, and the Lord shall\ndeliver them into my hand, shall I be your prince?","They answered him:  The Lord, who heareth these things, he\nhimself is mediator and witness that we will do as we have promised.","Jephte therefore went with the princes of Galaad, and all the\npeople made him their prince.  And Jephte spoke all his words before the\nLord in Maspha.","And he sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, to\nsay in his name:  What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come\nagainst me, to waste my land?","And he answered them:  Because Israel took away my land, when he\ncame up out of Egypt, from the confines of the Arnon unto the Jaboc and\nthe Jordan:  now, therefore, restore the same peaceably to me.","And Jephte again sent word by them, and commanded them to say to\nthe king of Ammon:","Thus saith Jephte:  Israel did not take away the land of Moab,\nnor the land of the children of Ammon:","But when they came up out of Egypt, he walked through the desert\nto the Red Sea, and came into Cades.","And he sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying:  Suffer me to\npass through thy land.  But he would not condescend to his request.  He\nsent also to the king of Moab, who, likewise, refused to give him\npassage.  He abode, therefore, in Cades,","And went round the land of Edom at the side, and the land of\nMoab:  and came over against the east coast of the land of Moab, and\ncamped on the other side of the Arnon:  and he would not enter the\nbounds of Moab.","So Israel sent messengers to Sehon, king of the Amorrhites, who\ndwelt in Hesebon, and they said to him:  Suffer me to pass through thy\nland to the river.","But he, also despising the words of Israel, suffered him not to\npass through his borders:  but gathering an infinite multitude, went out\nagainst him to Jasa, and made strong opposition.","And the Lord delivered him, with all his army, into the hands of\nIsrael, and he slew him, and possessed all the land of the Amorrhite,\nthe inhabitant of that country,","And all the coasts thereof from the Arnon to the Jaboc, and from\nthe wilderness to the Jordan.","So the Lord, the God of Israel, destroyed the Amorrhite, his\npeople of Israel fighting against him, and wilt thou now possess his\nland?","Are not those things which thy god Chamos possesseth, due to\nthee by right?  But what the Lord our God hath obtained by conquest,\nshall be our possession:","Unless, perhaps, thou art better than Balac, the son of Sephor,\nking of Moab:  or canst shew that he strove against Israel, and fought\nagainst him,","Whereas he hath dwelt in Hesebon, and the villages thereof, and\nin Aroer, and its villages, and in all the cities near the Jordan, for\nthree hundred years.  Why have you for so long a time attempted nothing\nabout this claim?","Therefore I do not trespass against thee, but thou wrongest me\nby declaring an unjust war against me.  The Lord be judge, and decide\nthis day, between Israel and the children of Ammon.","And the king of the children of Ammon would not hearken to the\nwords of Jephte, which he sent him by the messengers.","Therefore the spirit of the Lord came upon Jephte, and going\nround Galaad, and Manasses, and Maspha of Galaad, and passing over from\nthence to the children of Ammon,","He made a vow to the Lord, saying:  If thou wilt deliver the\nchildren of Ammon into my hands,","Whosoever shall first come forth out of the doors of my house,\nand shall meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon,\nthe same will I offer a holocaust to the Lord.","And Jephte passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against\nthem:  and the Lord delivered them into his hands.","And he smote them from Aroer till you come to Mennith, twenty\ncities, and as far as Abel, which is set with vineyards, with a very\ngreat slaughter:  and the children of Ammon were humbled by the children\nof Israel.","And when Jephte returned into Maspha, to his house, his only\ndaughter met him with timbrels and with dances:  for he had no other\nchildren.","And when he saw her, he rent his garments, and said:  Alas! my\ndaughter, thou hast deceived me, and thou thyself art deceived:  for I\nhave opened my mouth to the Lord, and I can do no other thing.","And she answered him:  My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth\nto the Lord, do unto me whatsoever thou hast promised, since the\nvictory hath been granted to thee, and revenge of thy enemies.","And she said to her father:  Grant me only this, which I desire:\nLet me go, that I may go about the mountains for two months, and may\nbewail my virginity with my companions.","And he answered her:  Go.  And he sent her away for two months.\nAnd when she was gone with her comrades and companions, she mourned her\nvirginity in the mountains.","And the two months being expired, she returned to her father,\nand he did to her as he had vowed, and she knew no man.  From thence\ncame a fashion in Israel, and a custom has been kept:","That, from year to year, the daughters of Israel assemble\ntogether, and lament the daughter of Jephte the Galaadite, for four\ndays."]}
