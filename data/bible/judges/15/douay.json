{"verses":["And a while after, when the days of the wheat harvest were at\nhand, Samson came, meaning to visit his wife, and he brought her a kid\nof the flock.  And when he would have gone into her chamber, as usual,\nher father would not suffer him, saying:","I thought thou hadst hated her, and therefore I gave her to thy\nfriend:  but she hath a sister, who is younger and fairer than she, take\nher to wife instead of her.","And Samson answered him:  From this day I shall be blameless in\nwhat I do against the Philistines:  for I will do you evils.","And he went and caught three hundred foxes, and coupled them tail\nto tail, and fastened torches between the tails:","And setting them on fire he let the foxes go, that they might run\nabout hither and thither.  And they presently went into the standing\ncorn of the Philistines.  Which being set on fire, both the corn that\nwas already carried together, and that which was yet standing, was all\nburnt, insomuch that the flame consumed also the vineyards and the\noliveyards.","Then the Philistines said:  Who hath done this thing?  And it was\nanswered:  Samson, the son in law of the Thamnathite, because he took\naway his wife, and gave her to another, hath done these things.  And the\nPhilistines went up and burnt both the woman and her father.","But Samson said to them:  Although you have done this, yet will I\nbe revenged of you, and then I will be quiet.","And he made a great slaughter of them, so that in astonishment\nthey laid the calf of the leg upon the thigh.  And going down he dwelt\nin a cavern of the rock Etam.","Then the Philistines going up into the land of Juda, camped in\nthe place which afterwards was called Lechi, that is, the Jawbone,\nwhere their army was spread abroad.","And the men of the tribe of Juda said to them:  Why are you come\nup against us?  They answered:  We are come to bind Samson, and to pay\nhim for what he hath done against us.","Wherefore three thousand men of Juda went down to the cave of\nthe rock Etam, and said to Samson:  Knowest thou not that the\nPhilistines rule over us?  Why wouldst thou do thus?  And he said to\nthem:  As they did to me, so have I done to them.","And they said to him:  We are come to bind thee, and to deliver\nthee into the hands of the Philistines.  And Samson said to them:  Swear\nto me, and promise me that you will not kill me.","They said:  We will not kill thee:  but we will deliver thee up\nbound.  And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him from the\nrock Etam.","Now when he was come to the place of the Jawbone, and the\nPhilistines shouting went to meet him, the Spirit of the Lord came\nstrongly upon him:  and as flax is wont to be consumed at the approach\nof fire, so the bands with which he was bound were broken and loosed.","And finding a jawbone, even the jawbone of an ass, which lay\nthere, catching it up, he slew therewith a thousand men.","And he said:  With the jawbone of an ass, with the jaw of the\ncolt of asses, I have destroyed them, and have slain a thousand men.","And when he had ended these words, singing, he threw the jawbone\nout of his hand, and called the name of that place Ramathlechi, which\nis interpreted the lifting up of the jawbone.","And being very thirsty, he cried to the Lord, and said:  Thou\nhast given this very great deliverance and victory into the hand of thy\nservant:  and behold I die for thirst, and shall fall into the hands of\nthe uncircumcised.","Then the Lord opened a great tooth in the jaw of the ass and\nwaters issued out of it.  And when he had drunk them, he refreshed his\nspirit, and recovered his strength.  Therefore the name of that place\nwas called The Spring of him that invoked from the jawbone, until this\npresent day.","And he judged Israel, in the days of the Philistines, twenty\nyears."]}
