{"verses":["Then Samson went down to Thamnatha, and seeing there a woman of\nthe daughters of the Philistines,","He came up, and told his father and his mother, saying:  I saw a\nwoman in Thamnatha of the daughters of the Philistines:  I beseech you,\ntake her for me to wife.","And his father and mother said to him:  Is there no woman among\nthe daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou wilt\ntake a wife of the Philistines, who are uncircumcised?  And Samson said\nto his father:  Take this woman for me; for she hath pleased my eyes.","Now his parents knew not that the thing was done by the Lord, and\nthat he sought an occasion against the Philistines:  for at that time\nthe Philistines had dominion over Israel.","Then Samson went down with his father and mother to Thamnatha.\nAnd when they were come to the vineyards of the town, behold a young\nlion met him, raging and roaring.","And the Spirit of the Lord came upon Samson, and he tore the lion\nas he would have torn a kid in pieces, having nothing at all in his\nhand:  and he would not tell this to his father and mother.","And he went down, and spoke to the woman that had pleased his\neyes.","And after some days, returning to take her, he went aside to see\nthe carcass of the lion, and behold there was a swarm of bees in the\nmouth of the lion, and a honey-comb.","And when he had taken it in his hands, he went on eating:  and\ncoming to his father and mother, he gave them of it, and they ate:  but\nhe would not tell them that he had taken the honey from the body of the\nlion.","So his father went down to the woman, and made a feast for his\nson Samson:  for so the young men used to do.","And when the citizens of that place saw him, they brought him\nthirty companions to be with him.","And Samson said to them:  I will propose to you a riddle, which\nif you declare unto me within the seven days of the feast, I will give\nyou thirty shirts, and as many coats:","But if you shall not be able to declare it, you shall give me\nthirty shirts and the same number of coats.  They answered him:  Put\nforth the riddle, that we may hear it.","And he said to them:  Out of the eater came forth meat, and out\nof the strong came forth sweetness.  And they could not for three days\nexpound the riddle.","And when the seventh day came, they said to the wife of Samson:\nSooth thy husband, and persuade him to tell thee what the riddle\nmeaneth.  But if thou wilt not do it, we will burn thee, and thy\nfather's house.  Have you called us to the wedding on purpose to strip\nus?","So she wept before Samson and complained, saying:  Thou hatest\nme, and dost not love me:  therefore thou wilt not expound to me the\nriddle, which thou hast proposed to the sons of my people.  But he\nanswered:  I would not tell it to my father and mother:  and how can I\ntell it to thee?","So she wept before him the seven days of the feast:  and, at\nlength, on the seventh day, as she was troublesome to him, he expounded\nit.  And she immediately told her countrymen.","And they, on the seventh day before the sun went down, said to\nhim:  What is sweeter than honey?  and what is stronger than a lion?  And\nhe said to them:  If you had not ploughed with my heifer, you had not\nfound out my riddle.","And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he went down to\nAscalon, and slew there thirty men whose garments he took away, and\ngave to them that had declared the riddle.  And being exceeding angry,\nhe went up to his father's house:","But his wife took one of his friends and bridal companions for\nher husband."]}
