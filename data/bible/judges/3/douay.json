{"verses":["These are the nations which the Lord left, that by them he might\ninstruct Israel, and all that had not known the wars of the\nChanaanites:","That afterwards their children might learn to fight with their\nenemies, and to be trained up to war:","The five princes of the Philistines, and all the Chanaanites, and\nthe Sidonians, and the Hevites that dwelt in Mount Libanus, from Mount\nBaal Hermon to the entering into Emath.","And he left them, that he might try Israel by them, whether they\nwould hear the commandments of the Lord, which he had commanded their\nfathers, by the hand of Moses, or not.","So the children of Israel dwelt in the midst of the Chanaanite,\nand the Hethite, and the Amorrhite, and the Pherezite, and the Hevite,\nand the Jebusite:","And they took their daughters to wives, and they gave their own\ndaughters to their sons, and they served their gods.","And they did evil in the sight of the Lord, and they forgot their\nGod, and served Baalim and Astaroth.","And the Lord being angry with Israel, delivered them into the\nhands of Chusan Rasathaim, king of Mesopotamia, and they served him\neight years.","And they cried to the Lord, who raised them up a saviour, and\ndelivered them; to wit, Othoniel, the son of Cenez, the younger brother\nof Caleb:","And the spirit of the Lord was in him, and he judged Israel.  And\nhe went out to fight, and the Lord delivered Chusan Rasathaim, king of\nSyria, and he overthrew him:","And the land rested forty years, and Othoniel, the son of Cenez,\ndied.","And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the\nLord:  who strengthened against them Eglon, king of Moab:  because they\ndid evil in his sight.","And he joined to him the children of Ammon, and Amalec:  and he\nwent and overthrew Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.","And the children of Israel served Eglon, king of Moab, eighteen\nyears.","And afterwards they cried to the Lord, who raised them up a\nsaviour, called Aod, the son of Cera, the son of Jemini, who used the\nleft hand as well as the right.  And the children of Israel sent\npresents to Eglon, king of Moab, by him.","And he made himself a two-edged sword, with a haft in the midst\nof the length of the palm of the hand, and was girded therewith, under\nhis garment, on the right thigh.","And he presented the gifts to Eglon, king of Moab Now Eglon was\nexceeding fat.","And when he had presented the gifts unto him he followed his\ncompanions that came along with him.","Then returning from Galgal, where the idols were, he said to the\nking:  I have a secret message to thee, O king.  And he commanded\nsilence:  and all being gone out that were about him,","Aod went in to him:  now he was sitting in a summer parlour alone,\nand he said:  I have a word from God to thee.  And he forthwith rose up\nfrom his throne.","And Aod put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his\nright thigh, and thrust it into his belly,","With such force that the haft went in after the blade into the\nwound, and was closed up with the abundance of fat.  So that he did not\ndraw out the dagger, but left it in the body as he had struck it in:\nand forthwith, by the secret parts of nature, the excrements of the\nbelly came out.","And Aod carefully shutting the doors of the parlour, and locking\nthem,","Went out by a postern door.  And the king's servants going in, saw\nthe doors of the parlour shut, and they said:  Perhaps he is easing\nnature in his summer parlour.","And waiting a long time, till they were ashamed, and seeing that\nno man opened the door, they took a key:  and opening, they found their\nlord lying dead on the ground.","But Aod, while they were in confusion, escaped, and passed by the\nplace of the idols from whence he had returned.  And he came to Seirath:","And forthwith he sounded the trumpet in Mount Ephraim:  and the\nchildren of Israel went down with him, he himself going in the front.","And he said to them:  Follow me:  for the Lord hath delivered our\nenemies, the Moabites, into our hands.  And they went down after him,\nand seized upon the fords of the Jordan, which are in the way to Moab:\nand they suffered no man to pass over:","But they slew of the Moabites at that time, about ten thousand,\nall strong and valiant men:  none of them could escape.","And Moab was humbled that day under the hand of Israel:  and the\nland rested eighty years.","After him was Samgar, the son of Anath, who slew of the\nPhilistines six hundred men with a ploughshare:  and he also defended\nIsrael."]}
