{"verses":["Let there be a trumpet in thy throat like an eagle upon the house\nof the Lord:  because they have transgressed my covenant, and have\nviolated my law.","They shall call upon me:  O my God, we, Israel, know thee.","Israel hath cast off the thing that is good, the enemy shall\npursue him.","They have reigned, but not by me:  they have been princes, and I\nknew not:  of their silver and their gold they have made idols to\nthemselves, that they might perish.","Thy calf, O Samaria, is cast off, my wrath is kindled against\nthem.  How long will they be incapable of being cleansed?","For itself also is the invention of Israel:  a workman made it, and\nit is no god:  for the calf of Samaria shall be turned to spiders' webs.","For they shall sow wind, and reap a whirlwind, there is no\nstanding stalk in it, the bud shall yield no meal; and if it should\nyield, strangers shall eat it.","Israel is swallowed up:  now is he become among the nations like an\nunclean vessel.","For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself:\nEphraim hath given gifts to his lovers.","But even though they shall have hired the nations, now will I\ngather them together:  and they shall rest a while from the burden of\nthe king, and the princes.","Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin:  altars are become\nto him unto sin.","I shall write to him my manifold laws, which have been accounted\nas foreign.","They shall offer victims, they shall sacrifice flesh, and shall\neat it, and the Lord will not receive them:  now will he remember their\niniquity, and will visit their sins:  they shall return to Egypt.","And Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and hath built temples:  and\nJuda hath built many fenced cities:  and I will send a fire upon his\ncities, and it shall devour the houses thereof."]}
