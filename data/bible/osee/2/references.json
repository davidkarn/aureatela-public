I am induced to write to you, a stranger to a stranger, by the entreaties of that holy servant of Christ Hedibia[fn-44-P4402_1198884:3112-nf] and of my daughter in the faith Artemia, once your wife but now no longer your wife but your sister and fellow-servant. Not content with assuring her own salvation she has sought yours also, in former days at home and now in the holy places. She is anxious to emulate the thoughtfulness of the apostles Andrew and Philip; who after Christ had found them, desired in their turn to find, the one his brother Simon and the other his friend Nathanael.[fn-44-P4403_1199437:3113-nf] To the former of these it was said \"Thou art Simon, the son of Jona: thou shall be called Cephas which is by interpretation a stone;\"[fn-44-P4404_1199604:3114-nf] while the latter, whose name Nathanael means the gift of God, was comforted by Christ's witness to him: \"behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no guile.\"[fn-44-P4405_1199779:3115-nf] So of old Lot[fn-44-P4406_1199814:3116-nf] desired to rescue his wife as well as his two daughters, and refusing to leave blazing Sodom and Gomorrah until he was himself half-on-fire, tried to lead forth one who was tied and bound by her past sins. But in her despair she lost her composure, and looking back became a monument of an unbelieving soul.[fn-44-P4407_1200148:3117-nf] Yet, as if to make up for the loss of a single woman, Lot's glowing faith set free the whole city of Zoar. In fact when he left the dark valleys in which Sodom lay and came to the mountains, the sun rose upon him as he entered Zoar or the little City; so-called because the little faith that Lot possessed, though unable to save greater places, was at least able to preserve smaller ones. For one who had gone so far astray as to live in Gomorrah could not all at once reach the noonland where Abraham, the friend of God,[fn-44-P4408_1200697:3118-nf] entertained God and His angels.[fn-44-P4409_1200751:3119-nf] (For it was in Egypt that Joseph fed his brothers, and when the bride speaks to the Bridegroom her cry is: \"tell me where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon.\"[fn-44-P4410_1200957:3120-nf] ) Good men have always sorrowed for the sins of others. Samuel of old lamented for Saul[fn-44-P4411_1201066:3121-nf] because he neglected to treat the ulcers of pride with the balm of penitence. And Paul wept for the Corinthians[fn-44-P4412_1201202:3122-nf] who refused to wash out with their tears the stains of fornication. For the same reason Ezekiel swallowed the book where were written within and without song, and lamentation and woe;[fn-44-P4413_1201409:3123-nf] the song in praise of the righteous, the lamentation over the penitent, and the woe for those of whom it is written, \"When the wicked man falleth into the depths of evil, then is he filled with scorn.\"[fn-44-P4414_1201639:3124-nf] It is to these that Isaiah alludes when he says: \"in that day did the Lord God of hosts call to weeping and to mourning and to baldness and to girding with sackcloth: and behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen; and killing sheep, eating flesh\" and saying, \"let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.\"[fn-44-P4415_1201969:3125-nf] Yet of such persons Ezekiel is bidden to speak thus: \"O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live? Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live,\" and again, \"turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?\"[fn-44-P4416_1202467:3126-nf] Nothing makes God so angry as when men from despair of better things cleave to those which are worse; and indeed this despair in itself is a sign of unbelief. One who despairs of salvation can have no expectation of a judgment to come. For if he dreaded such, he would by doing good works prepare to meet his Judge. Let us hear what God says through Jeremiah, \"withhold thy foot from a rough way and thy throat from thirst\"[fn-44-P4417_1202936:3127-nf] and again \"shall they fall, and not arise? Shall he turn away, and not return?\"[fn-44-P4418_1203043:3128-nf] Let us hear also what God says by Isaiah: \"When thou shalt turn and bewail thyself, then shall thou be saved, and then shalt thou know where thou hast hitherto been.\"[fn-44-P4419_1203233:3129-nf] We do not realize the miseries of sickness till returning health reveals them to us. So sins serve as a foil to the blessedness of virtue; and light shines more brightly when it is relieved against darkness. Ezekiel uses language like that of the other prophets because he is animated by a similar spirit. \"Repent,\" he cries, \"and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. Cast away from you all your transgressions whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel? For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord.\"[fn-44-P4420_1203902:3130-nf] Wherefore in a subsequent passage he says: \"As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked: but that the wicked turn from his way and live.\"[fn-44-P4421_1204103:3131-nf] These words shew us that the mind must not through disbelief in the promised blessings give way to despair; and that the soul once marked out for perdition must not refuse to apply remedies on the ground that its wounds are past curing. Ezekiel describes God as swearing, that if we refuse to believe His promise in regard to our salvation we may at least believe His oath. It is with full confidence that the righteous man prays and says, \"Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease,\"[fn-44-P4422_1204647:3132-nf] and again, \"Lord, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face and I was troubled.\"[fn-44-P4423_1204792:3133-nf] He means to say, \"when I forsook the foulness of my faults for the beauty of virtue, God strengthened my weakness with His grace.\" Lo, I hear. His promise: \"I will pursue mine enemies and overtake them: neither will I turn again till they are consumed,\"[fn-44-P4424_1205067:3134-nf] so that I who was once thine enemy and a fugitive from thee, shall be laid hold of by thine hand. Cease not from pursuing me till my wickedness is consumed, and I return to my old husband who will give me my wool and my flax, my oil and my fine flour and will feed me with the richest foods.[fn-44-P4425_1205388:3135-nf] He it was who hedged up and enclosed my evil ways[fn-44-P4426_1205461:3136-nf] that I might find Him the true way who says in the gospel, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life.\"[fn-44-P4427_1205582:3137-nf] Hear the words of the prophet: \"they that sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.\"[fn-44-P4428_1205809:3138-nf] Say also with him: \"All the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears\"[fn-44-P4429_1205935:3139-nf] : and again, \"As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God? My tears have been my meat day and night,\"[fn-44-P4430_1206182:3140-nf] and in another place, \"O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and weary land where no water is. So have I looked upon thee in the sanctuary.\"[fn-44-P4431_1206420:3141-nf] For although my soul has thirsted after thee, yet much more have I sought thee by the labour of my flesh and have not been able to look upon thee in thy sanctuary; not at any rate till I have first dwelt in a land barren of sin, where the weary wayfarer is no more assailed by the adversary, and where there are no pools or rivers of lust.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1244","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"I.

She is anxious to emulate the thoughtfulness of the apostles Andrew and Philip; who after Christ had found them, desired in their turn to find, the one his brother Simon and the other his friend Nathanael.[fn-44-P4403_1199437:3113-nf] To the former of these it was said \"Thou art Simon, the son of Jona: thou shall be called Cephas which is by interpretation a stone;\"[fn-44-P4404_1199604:3114-nf] while the latter, whose name Nathanael means the gift of God, was comforted by Christ's witness to him: \"behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no guile.\"[fn-44-P4405_1199779:3115-nf] So of old Lot[fn-44-P4406_1199814:3116-nf] desired to rescue his wife as well as his two daughters, and refusing to leave blazing Sodom and Gomorrah until he was himself half-on-fire, tried to lead forth one who was tied and bound by her past sins. But in her despair she lost her composure, and looking back became a monument of an unbelieving soul.[fn-44-P4407_1200148:3117-nf] Yet, as if to make up for the loss of a single woman, Lot's glowing faith set free the whole city of Zoar. In fact when he left the dark valleys in which Sodom lay and came to the mountains, the sun rose upon him as he entered Zoar or the little City; so-called because the little faith that Lot possessed, though unable to save greater places, was at least able to preserve smaller ones. For one who had gone so far astray as to live in Gomorrah could not all at once reach the noonland where Abraham, the friend of God,[fn-44-P4408_1200697:3118-nf] entertained God and His angels.[fn-44-P4409_1200751:3119-nf] (For it was in Egypt that Joseph fed his brothers, and when the bride speaks to the Bridegroom her cry is: \"tell me where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon.\"[fn-44-P4410_1200957:3120-nf] ) Good men have always sorrowed for the sins of others. Samuel of old lamented for Saul[fn-44-P4411_1201066:3121-nf] because he neglected to treat the ulcers of pride with the balm of penitence. And Paul wept for the Corinthians[fn-44-P4412_1201202:3122-nf] who refused to wash out with their tears the stains of fornication. For the same reason Ezekiel swallowed the book where were written within and without song, and lamentation and woe;[fn-44-P4413_1201409:3123-nf] the song in praise of the righteous, the lamentation over the penitent, and the woe for those of whom it is written, \"When the wicked man falleth into the depths of evil, then is he filled with scorn.\"[fn-44-P4414_1201639:3124-nf] It is to these that Isaiah alludes when he says: \"in that day did the Lord God of hosts call to weeping and to mourning and to baldness and to girding with sackcloth: and behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen; and killing sheep, eating flesh\" and saying, \"let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.\"[fn-44-P4415_1201969:3125-nf] Yet of such persons Ezekiel is bidden to speak thus: \"O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live? Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live,\" and again, \"turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?\"[fn-44-P4416_1202467:3126-nf] Nothing makes God so angry as when men from despair of better things cleave to those which are worse; and indeed this despair in itself is a sign of unbelief. One who despairs of salvation can have no expectation of a judgment to come. For if he dreaded such, he would by doing good works prepare to meet his Judge. Let us hear what God says through Jeremiah, \"withhold thy foot from a rough way and thy throat from thirst\"[fn-44-P4417_1202936:3127-nf] and again \"shall they fall, and not arise? Shall he turn away, and not return?\"[fn-44-P4418_1203043:3128-nf] Let us hear also what God says by Isaiah: \"When thou shalt turn and bewail thyself, then shall thou be saved, and then shalt thou know where thou hast hitherto been.\"[fn-44-P4419_1203233:3129-nf] We do not realize the miseries of sickness till returning health reveals them to us. So sins serve as a foil to the blessedness of virtue; and light shines more brightly when it is relieved against darkness. Ezekiel uses language like that of the other prophets because he is animated by a similar spirit. \"Repent,\" he cries, \"and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. Cast away from you all your transgressions whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel? For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord.\"[fn-44-P4420_1203902:3130-nf] Wherefore in a subsequent passage he says: \"As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked: but that the wicked turn from his way and live.\"[fn-44-P4421_1204103:3131-nf] These words shew us that the mind must not through disbelief in the promised blessings give way to despair; and that the soul once marked out for perdition must not refuse to apply remedies on the ground that its wounds are past curing. Ezekiel describes God as swearing, that if we refuse to believe His promise in regard to our salvation we may at least believe His oath. It is with full confidence that the righteous man prays and says, \"Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease,\"[fn-44-P4422_1204647:3132-nf] and again, \"Lord, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face and I was troubled.\"[fn-44-P4423_1204792:3133-nf] He means to say, \"when I forsook the foulness of my faults for the beauty of virtue, God strengthened my weakness with His grace.\" Lo, I hear. His promise: \"I will pursue mine enemies and overtake them: neither will I turn again till they are consumed,\"[fn-44-P4424_1205067:3134-nf] so that I who was once thine enemy and a fugitive from thee, shall be laid hold of by thine hand. Cease not from pursuing me till my wickedness is consumed, and I return to my old husband who will give me my wool and my flax, my oil and my fine flour and will feed me with the richest foods.[fn-44-P4425_1205388:3135-nf] He it was who hedged up and enclosed my evil ways[fn-44-P4426_1205461:3136-nf] that I might find Him the true way who says in the gospel, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life.\"[fn-44-P4427_1205582:3137-nf] Hear the words of the prophet: \"they that sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.\"[fn-44-P4428_1205809:3138-nf] Say also with him: \"All the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears\"[fn-44-P4429_1205935:3139-nf] : and again, \"As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God? My tears have been my meat day and night,\"[fn-44-P4430_1206182:3140-nf] and in another place, \"O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and weary land where no water is. So have I looked upon thee in the sanctuary.\"[fn-44-P4431_1206420:3141-nf] For although my soul has thirsted after thee, yet much more have I sought thee by the labour of my flesh and have not been able to look upon thee in thy sanctuary; not at any rate till I have first dwelt in a land barren of sin, where the weary wayfarer is no more assailed by the adversary, and where there are no pools or rivers of lust.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1275","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"In speaking thus I do not mean to sever the law from the gospel, as Marcion[fn-46-P4618_1254134:3296-nf] falsely does.

Besides, if we are to deal with symbols and types of things to come, we must judge of them not by our own opinions but in the light of the apostle's explanations. Hagar and Sarah, or Sinai and Zion, are typical of the two testaments.[fn-46-P4619_1254772:3297-nf] Leah who was tender-eyed and Rachel whom Jacob loved[fn-46-P4620_1254850:3298-nf] signify the synagogue and the church. So likewise do Hannah and Peninnah of whom the former, at first barren, afterwards exceeded the latter in fruitfulness. In Isaac and Rebekah we see an early example of monogamy: it was only to Rebekah that the Lord revealed Himself in the hour of childbirth and she alone went of herself to enquire of the Lord.[fn-46-P4621_1255239:3299-nf] What shall I say of Tamar who bore twin sons, Pharez and Zarah?[fn-46-P4622_1255340:3300-nf] At their birth was broken down that middle wall of partition which typified the division existing between the two peoples;[fn-46-P4623_1255493:3301-nf] while the binding of Zarah's hand with the scarlet thread even then marked the conscience of the Jews with the stain of Christ's blood. And how shall I speak of the whore married by the prophet[fn-46-P4624_1255709:3302-nf] who is a figure either of the church as gathered in from the Gentiles or-an interpretation which better suits the passage-of the synagogue? First adopted from among the idolaters by Abraham and Moses, this has now denied the Saviour and proved unfaithful to Him. Therefore it has long been deprived of its altar, priests, and prophets and has to abide many days for its first husband.[fn-46-P4625_1256128:3303-nf] For when the fulness of the Gentiles shall have come in, all Israel shall be saved.[fn-46-P4626_1256246:3304-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_01_npnf1_01_15_book_vii_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"49","folder":"NPNF1-01","text":"15.

For unless He had given it to all by no means would He have habitually permitted even proselytes out of the nations to have access to it. But-as is congruous with the goodness of God, and with His equity, as the Fashioner of mankind-He gave to all nations the selfsame law, which at definite and stated times He enjoined should be observed, when He willed, and through whom He willed, and as He willed. For in the beginning of the world He gave to Adam himself and Eve a law, that they were not to eat of the fruit of the tree planted in the midst of paradise; but that, if they did contrariwise, by death they were to die.[fn-20-P2047_698574:16-nf] Which law had continued enough for them, had it been kept.

For the primordial law was given to Adam and Eve in paradise, as the womb of all the precepts of God. In short, if they had loved the Lord their God, they would not have contravened His precept; if they had habitually loved their neighbour-that is, themselves[fn-20-P2050_699548:19-nf] -they would not have believed the persuasion of the serpent, and thus would not have committed murder upon themselves,[fn-20-P2051_699698:20-nf] by falling[fn-20-P2052_699740:21-nf] from immortality, by contravening God's precept; from theft also they would have abstained, if they had not stealthily tasted of the fruit of the tree, nor had been anxious to skulk beneath a tree to escape the view of the Lord their God; nor would they have been made partners with the falsehood-asseverating devil, by believing him that they would be \"like God; \"and thus they would not have offended God either, as their Father, who had fashioned them from clay of the earth, as out of the womb of a mother; if they had not coveted another's, they would not have tasted of the unlawful fruit. Therefore, in this general and primordial law of God, the observance of which, in the case of the tree's fruit, He had sanctioned, we recognise enclosed all the precepts specially of the posterior Law, which germinated when disclosed at their proper times. For the subsequent superinduction of a law is the work of the same Being who had before premised a precept; since it is His province withal subsequently to train, who had before resolved to form, righteous creatures. For what wonder if He extends a discipline who institutes it? if He advances who begins? In short, before the Law of Moses,[fn-20-P2053_701005:22-nf] written in stone-tables, I contend that there was a law unwritten, which was habitually understood naturally, and by the fathers was habitually kept.

In fact, it was after Abraham's \"four hundred and thirty years\"[fn-20-P2057_702033:26-nf] that the Law was given. Whence we understand that God's law was anterior even to Moses, and was not first (given) in Horeb, nor in Sinai and in the desert, but was more ancient; (existing) first in paradise, subsequently reformed for the patriarchs, and so again for the Jews, at definite periods: so that we are not to give heed to Moses' Law as to the primitive law, but as to a subsequent, which at a definite period God has set forth to the Gentiles too and, after repeatedly promising so to do through the prophets, has reformed for the better; and has premonished that it should come to pass that, just as \"the law was given through Moses\"[fn-20-P2058_702739:27-nf] at a definite time, so it should be believed to have been temporarily observed and kept. And let us not annul this power which God has, which reforms the law's precepts answerably to the circumstances of the times, with a view to man's salvation. In fine, let him who contends that the Sabbath is still to be observed as a balm of salvation, and circumcision on the eighth day because of the threat of death, teach us that, for the time past, righteous men kept the Sabbath, or practised circumcision, and were thus rendered \"friends of God.\" For if circumcision purges a man since God made Adam uncircumcised, why did He not circumcise him, even after his sinning, if circumcision purges? At all events, in settling him in paradise, He appointed one uncircumcised as colonist of paradise.

For in the beginning of the world He gave to Adam himself and Eve a law, that they were not to eat of the fruit of the tree planted in the midst of paradise; but that, if they did contrariwise, by death they were to die.[fn-20-P2047_698574:16-nf] Which law had continued enough for them, had it been kept. For in this law given to Adam we recognise in embryo[fn-20-P2048_698720:17-nf] all the precepts which afterwards sprouted forth when given through Moses; that is, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God from thy whole heart and out of thy whole soul; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;[fn-20-P2049_698941:18-nf] Thou shalt not kill; Thou shall not commit adultery; Thou shalt not steal; False witness thou shall not utter; Honour thy father and mother; and, That which is another's, shall thou not covet. For the primordial law was given to Adam and Eve in paradise, as the womb of all the precepts of God. In short, if they had loved the Lord their God, they would not have contravened His precept; if they had habitually loved their neighbour-that is, themselves[fn-20-P2050_699548:19-nf] -they would not have believed the persuasion of the serpent, and thus would not have committed murder upon themselves,[fn-20-P2051_699698:20-nf] by falling[fn-20-P2052_699740:21-nf] from immortality, by contravening God's precept; from theft also they would have abstained, if they had not stealthily tasted of the fruit of the tree, nor had been anxious to skulk beneath a tree to escape the view of the Lord their God; nor would they have been made partners with the falsehood-asseverating devil, by believing him that they would be \"like God; \"and thus they would not have offended God either, as their Father, who had fashioned them from clay of the earth, as out of the womb of a mother; if they had not coveted another's, they would not have tasted of the unlawful fruit. Therefore, in this general and primordial law of God, the observance of which, in the case of the tree's fruit, He had sanctioned, we recognise enclosed all the precepts specially of the posterior Law, which germinated when disclosed at their proper times. For the subsequent superinduction of a law is the work of the same Being who had before premised a precept; since it is His province withal subsequently to train, who had before resolved to form, righteous creatures. For what wonder if He extends a discipline who institutes it? if He advances who begins? In short, before the Law of Moses,[fn-20-P2053_701005:22-nf] written in stone-tables, I contend that there was a law unwritten, which was habitually understood naturally, and by the fathers was habitually kept. For whence was Noah \"found righteous,\"[fn-20-P2054_701248:23-nf] if in his case the righteousness of a natural law had not preceded? Whence was Abraham accounted \"a friend of God,\"[fn-20-P2055_701408:24-nf] if not on the ground of equity and righteousness, (in the observance) of a natural law? Whence was Melchizedek named \"priest of the most high God,\"[fn-20-P2056_701591:25-nf] if, before the priesthood of the Levitical law, there were not levites who were wont to offer sacrifices to God? For thus, after the above-mentioned patriarchs, was the Law given to Moses, at that (well-known) time after their exode from Egypt, after the interval and spaces of four hundred years. In fact, it was after Abraham's \"four hundred and thirty years\"[fn-20-P2057_702033:26-nf] that the Law was given. Whence we understand that God's law was anterior even to Moses, and was not first (given) in Horeb, nor in Sinai and in the desert, but was more ancient; (existing) first in paradise, subsequently reformed for the patriarchs, and so again for the Jews, at definite periods: so that we are not to give heed to Moses' Law as to the primitive law, but as to a subsequent, which at a definite period God has set forth to the Gentiles too and, after repeatedly promising so to do through the prophets, has reformed for the better; and has premonished that it should come to pass that, just as \"the law was given through Moses\"[fn-20-P2058_702739:27-nf] at a definite time, so it should be believed to have been temporarily observed and kept. And let us not annul this power which God has, which reforms the law's precepts answerably to the circumstances of the times, with a view to man's salvation. In fine, let him who contends that the Sabbath is still to be observed as a balm of salvation, and circumcision on the eighth day because of the threat of death, teach us that, for the time past, righteous men kept the Sabbath, or practised circumcision, and were thus rendered \"friends of God.\" For if circumcision purges a man since God made Adam uncircumcised, why did He not circumcise him, even after his sinning, if circumcision purges? At all events, in settling him in paradise, He appointed one uncircumcised as colonist of paradise. Therefore, since God originated Adam uncircumcised, and inobservant of the Sabbath, consequently his offspring also, Abel, offering Him sacrifices, uncircumcised and inobservant of the Sabbath, was by Him commended; while He accepted[fn-20-P2059_703780:28-nf] what he was offering in simplicity of heart, and reprobated the sacrifice of his brother Cain, who was not rightly dividing what he was offering.[fn-20-P2060_703955:29-nf] Noah also, uncircumcised-yes, and inobservant of the Sabbath-God freed from the deluge.[fn-20-P2061_704104:30-nf] For Enoch, too, most righteous man, uncircumcised and in-observant of the Sabbath, He translated from this world;[fn-20-P2062_704259:31-nf] who did not first taste[fn-20-P2063_704320:32-nf] death, in order that, being a candidate for eternal life,[fn-20-P2064_704418:33-nf] he might by this time show us that we also may, without the burden of the law of Moses, please God.

For they allege that Marcion did not so much innovate on the rule (of faith) by his separation of the law and the gospel, as restore it after it had been previously adulterated. O Christ,[fn-41-P4101_1340277:234-nf] most enduring Lord, who didst bear so many years with this interference with Thy revelation, until Marcion forsooth came to Thy rescue! Now they adduce the case of Peter himself, and the others, who were pillars of the apostolate, as having been blamed by Paul for not walking uprightly, according to the truth of the gospel-that very Paul indeed, who, being yet in the mere rudiments of grace, and trembling, in short, lest he should have run or were still running in vain, then for the first time held intercourse with those who were apostles before himself. Therefore because, in the eagerness of his zeal against Judaism as a neophyte, he thought that there was something to be blamed in their conduct-even the promiscuousness of their conversation[fn-41-P4102_1341067:235-nf] -but afterwards was himself to become in his practice all things to all men, that he might gain all,-to the Jews, as a Jew, and to them that were under the law, as under the law,-you would have his censure, which was merely directed against conduct destined to become acceptable even to their accuser, suspected of prevarication against God on a point of public doctrine.[fn-41-P4103_1341475:236-nf] Touching their public doctrine, however, they had, as we have already said, joined hands in perfect concord, and had agreed also in the division of their labour in their fellowship of the gospel, as they had indeed in all other respects:[fn-41-P4104_1341775:237-nf] \"Whether it were I or they, so we preach.\"[fn-41-P4105_1341835:238-nf] When, again, he mentioned \"certain false brethren as having crept in unawares,\" who wished to remove the Galatians into another gospel,[fn-41-P4106_1341992:239-nf] he himself shows that that adulteration of the gospel was not meant to transfer them to the faith of another god and christ, but rather to perpetuate the teaching of the law; because he blames them for maintaining circumcision, and observing times, and days, and months, and years, according to those Jewish ceremonies which they ought to have known were now abrogated, according to the new dispensation purposed by the Creator Himself, who of old foretold this very thing by His prophets. Thus He says by Isaiah: Old things have passed away. \"Behold, I will do a new thing.\"[fn-41-P4107_1342604:240-nf] And in another passage: \"I will make a new covenant, not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt.\"[fn-41-P4108_1342790:241-nf] In like manner by Jeremiah: Make to yourselves a new covenant, \"circumcise yourselves to the Lord, and take away the foreskins of your heart.\"[fn-41-P4109_1342988:242-nf] It is this circumcision, therefore, and this renewal, which the apostle insisted on, when he forbade those ancient ceremonies concerning which their very founder announced that they were one day to cease; thus by Hosea: \"I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast-days, her new moons, and her Sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.\"[fn-41-P4110_1343347:243-nf] So likewise by Isaiah: \"The new moons, and Sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; your holy days, and fasts, and feast-days, my soul hateth.\"[fn-41-P4111_1343527:244-nf] Now, if even the Creator had so long before discarded all these things, and the apostle was now proclaiming them to be worthy of renunciation, the very agreement of the apostle's meaning with the decrees of the Creator proves that none other God was preached by the apostle than He whose purposes he now wished to have recognised, branding as false both apostles and brethren, for the express reason that they were pushing back the gospel of Christ the Creator from the new condition which the Creator had foretold, to the old one which He had discarded.","title":"Book I.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_28_the_second_epistle_of_clement","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Brethren, it is fitting that you should think of Jesus Christ as of God,-as the Judge of the living and the dead.

But as, in the case of thieves, something of the stolen goods is apt to drop by the way, as a clue to their detection; so, as it seems to me, it has happened to Marcion: the last mention of Abraham's name he has left untouched (in the epistle), although no passage required his erasure more than this, even his partial alteration of the text.[fn-73-P7312_2111763:159-nf] \"For (it is written) that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bond maid, the other by a free woman; but he who was of the bond maid was born after the flesh, but he of the free woman was by promise: which things are allegorized\"[fn-73-P7313_2112197:160-nf] (that is to say, they presaged something besides the literal history); \"for these are the two covenants,\" or the two exhibitions (of the divine plans),[fn-73-P7314_2112560:161-nf] as we have found the word interpreted,\" the one from the Mount Sinai,\" in relation to the synagogue of the Jews, according to the law, \"which gendereth to bondage\"-\"the other gendereth\" (to liberty, being raised) above all principality, and power, and dominion, and every name that is l named, not only in this world, but in that which is to come, \"which is the mother of us all,\" in which we have the promise of (Christ's) holy church; by reason of which he adds in conclusion: \"So then, brethren, we are not children of the bond woman, but of the free.\"[fn-73-P7315_2113158:162-nf] In this passage he has undoubtedly shown that Christianity had a noble birth, being sprung, as the mystery of the allegory indicates, from that son of Abraham who was born of the free woman; whereas from the son of the bond maid came the legal bondage of Judaism. Both dispensations, therefore, emanate from that same God by whom,[fn-73-P7316_2113516:163-nf] as we have found, they were both sketched out beforehand. When he speaks of \"the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free,\"[fn-73-P7317_2113660:164-nf] does not the very phrase indicate that He is the Liberator who was once the Master? For Galba himself never liberated slaves which were not his own, even when about to restore free men to their liberty.[fn-73-P7318_2113881:165-nf] By Him, therefore, will liberty be bestowed, at whose command lay the enslaving power of the law. And very properly. It was not meet that those who had received liberty should be \"entangled again with the yoke of bondage\"[fn-73-P7319_2114436:166-nf] -that is, of the law; now that the Psalm had its prophecy accomplished: \"Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us, since the rulers have gathered themselves together against the Lord and against His Christ.\"[fn-73-P7320_2114689:167-nf] All those, therefore, who had been delivered from the yoke of slavery he would earnestly have to obliterate the very mark of slavery-even circumcision, on the authority of the prophet'sprediction. He remembered how that Jeremiah had said, \"Circumcise the foreskins of your heart; \"[fn-73-P7321_2114992:168-nf] as Moses likewise had enjoined, \"Circumcise your hard hearts\"[fn-73-P7322_2115073:169-nf] -not the literal flesh. If, now, he were for excluding circumcision, as the messenger of a new god, why does he say that \"in Christ neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision?[fn-73-P7323_2115285:170-nf] For it was his duty to prefer the rival principle of that which he was abolishing, if he had a mission from the god who was the enemy of circumcision.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"76","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In Genesis: \"And the Lord said unto Rebekah, Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples shall be separated from thy belly; and the one people shall overcome the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.\"[fn-80-P8055_2686407:79-nf] Also in Hosea: \"I will call them my people that are not my people, and her beloved that was not beloved.

For there were also true Israelites, as the Lord Himself bears witness to Nathanael, \"Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile.\"[fn-33-P3391_1940372:57-nf] But who are true Christians, save those of whom the same Lord said, \"He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me?\"[fn-33-P3392_1940532:58-nf] But what is it to keep His commandments, except to abide in love? Whence also He says, \"A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another;\" and again, \"By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.\"[fn-33-P3393_1940799:59-nf] But who can doubt that this was spoken not only to those who heard His words with their fleshly ears when He was present with them, but also to those who learn His words through the gospel, when He is sitting on His throne in heaven? For He came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill.[fn-33-P3394_1941110:60-nf] But the fulfilling of the law is love.[fn-33-P3395_1941167:61-nf] And in this Cyprian abounded greatly, insomuch that though he held a different view concerning baptism, he yet did not forsake the unity of the Church, and was in the Lord's vine a branch firmly rooted, bearing fruit, which the heavenly Husbandman purged with the knife of suffering, that it should bear more fruit.[fn-33-P3396_1941503:62-nf] But the enemies of this brotherly love, whether they are openly without, or appear to be within, are false Christians, and antichrists. For when they have found an opportunity, they go out, as it is written: \"A man wishing to separate himself from his friends, seeketh opportunities.\"[fn-33-P3397_1941807:63-nf] But even if occasions are wanting, while they seem to be within, they are severed from that invisible bond of love. Whence St. John says, \"They went out from us, but they were not of us; for had they been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us.\"[fn-33-P3398_1942106:64-nf] He does not say that they ceased to be of us by going out, but that they went out because they were not of us. The Apostle Paul also speaks of certain men who had erred concerning the truth, and were overthrowing the faith of some; whose word was eating as a canker. Yet in saying that they should be avoided, he nevertheless intimates that they were all in one great house, but as vessels to dishonor,-I suppose because they had not as yet gone out. Or if they had already gone out, how can he say that they were in the same great house with the honorable vessels, unless it was in virtue of the sacraments themselves, which even in the severed meetings of heretics are not changed, that he speaks of all as belonging to the same great house, though in different degrees of esteem, some to honor and some to dishonor? For thus he speaks in his Epistle to Timothy: \"But shun profane and vain babblings; for they will increase unto more ungodliness. And their word will eat as doth a canker; of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some. Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth firm, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are His. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, andsome to dishonor. If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.\"[fn-33-P3399_1943743:65-nf] But what is it to purge oneself from such as these, except what he said just before, \"Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.\" And lest any one should think that, as being in one great house with them, he might perish with such as these, he has most carefully forewarned them, \"The Lord knoweth them that are His,\"-those, namely, who, by departing from iniquity, purge themselves from the vessels made to dishonor, lest they should perish with them whom they are compelled to tolerate in the great house.","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_54_book_iii_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"67","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"27. They, therefore, who are wicked, evildoers, carnal, fleshly, devilish, think that they receive at the hands of their seducers what are the gifts of God alone, whether sacraments, or any spiritual workings about present salvation. But these men have not love towards God, but are busied about those by whose pride they are led astray, and are compared to the adulterous woman, whom the prophet introduces as saying, \"I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, and my oil, and everything that befits me.\" For thus arise heresies and schisms, when the fleshly people which is not rounded on the love of God says, \"I will go after my lovers,\" with whom, either by corruption of her faith, or by the puffing up of her pride, she shamefully commits adultery. But for the sake of those who, having undergone the difficulties, and straits, and barriers of the empty reasoning of those by whom they are led astray, afterwards feel the prickings of fear, and return to the way of peace, to seeking God in all sincerity,-for their sake He goes on to say, \"Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths. And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them: and she shall seek them, but she shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.\" Then, that they may not attribute to their seducers what they have that is sound, and derived from the doctrine of truth, by which they lead them astray to the falseness of their own dogmas and dissensions; that they may not think that what is sound in them belongs to them, he immediately added, \"And she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her money; but she made vessels of gold and silver for Baal.\"[fn-34-P3401_1946163:66-nf] For she had said above, \"I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread,\" etc., not at all understanding that all this, which was held soundly and lawfully by her seducers, was of God, and not of men. Nor would even they themselves claim these things for themselves, and as it were assert a right in them, had not they in turn been led astray by a people which had gone astray, when faith is reposed in them, and such honors are paid to them, that they should be enabled thereby to say such things, and claim such things for themselves, that their error should be called truth, and their iniquity be thought righteousness, in virtue of the sacraments and Scriptures, which they hold, not for salvation, but only in appearance. Accordingly, the same adulterous woman is addressed by the mouth of Ezekiel: \"Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with them; and tookest my[fn-34-P3402_1947177:67-nf] broidered garments, and coveredst them: and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them. My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast even set it before thine idols for a sweet savor: and this thou hast done.\"[fn-34-P3403_1947602:68-nf] For she turns all the sacraments, and the words of the sacred books, to the images of her own idols, with which her carnal mind delights to wallow. Nor yet, because those images are false, and the doctrines of devils, speaking lies in hypocrisy,[fn-34-P3404_1947871:69-nf] are those sacraments and divine utterances therefore so to lose their due honor, as to be thought to belong to such as these; seeing that the Lord says,\" Of my gold, and my silver, and my broidered garments, and mine oil, and mine incense, and my meat,\" and so forth. Ought we, because those erring ones think that these things belong to their seducers, therefore not to recognize whose they really are, when He Himself says, \"And she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her money\"? For He did not say that she did not have these things because she was an adulteress; but she is said to have had them, and that not as belonging to herself or her lovers, but to God, whose alone they are. Although, therefore, she had her fornication, yet those things wherewith she adorned it, whether as seduced or in her turn seducing, belonged not to her, but to God. If these things were spoken in a figure of the Jewish nation, when the scribes and Pharisees were rejecting the commandment of God in order to set up their own traditions, so that they were in a manner committing whoredom with a people which was abandoning their God; and yet for all that, whoredom at that time among the people, such as the Lord brought to light by convicting it, did not cause that the mysteries should belong to them, which were not theirs but God's, who, in speaking to the adulteress, says that all these things were His; whence the Lord Himself also sent those whom He cleansed from leprosy to the same mysteries, that they should offer sacrifice for themselves before the priests, because that sacrifice had not become efficacious for them, which He Himself afterwards wished to be commemorated in the Church for all of them, because He Himself proclaimed the tidings to them all;-if this be so, how much the more ought we, when we find the sacraments of the New Testament among certain heretics or schismatics, not to attribute them to these men, nor to condemn them, as though we could not recognize them? We ought to recognize the gifts of the true husband, though in the possession of an adulteress, and to amend, by the word of truth, that whoredom which is the true possession of the unchaste woman, instead of finding fault with the gifts, which belong entirely to the pitying Lord.","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_58_book_i","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"107","folder":"ANF-01","text":"3.

Some one says, Does it then make no difference, if two men, rooted in like error and wickedness, be baptized without change of life or heart, one without, the other within the Church? I acknowledge that there is a difference. For he is worse who is baptized without, in addition to his other sin,-not because of his baptism, however, but because he is without; for the evil of division is in itself far from insignificant or trivial. Yet the difference exists only if he who is baptized within has desired to be within not for the sake of any earthly or temporal advantage, but because he has preferred the unity of the Church spread throughout the world to the divisions of schism; otherwise he too must be considered among those who are without. Let us therefore put the two cases in this way. Let us suppose that the one, for the sake of argument, held the same opinions as Photinus[fn-35-P3569_2005308:107-nf] about Christ, and was baptized in his heresy outside the communion of the Catholic Church; and that another held the same opinion but was baptized in the Catholic Church, believing that his view was really the Catholic faith. I consider him as not yet a heretic, unless, when the doctrine of the Catholic faith is made clear to him, he chooses to resist it, and prefers that which he already holds; and till this is the case, it is clear that he who was baptized outside is the worse. And so in the one case erroneous opinion alone, in the other the sin of schism also, requires correction; but in neither of them is the truth of the sacrament to be repeated. But if any one holds the same view as the first, and knows that it is only in heresy severed from the Church that such a view is taught or learned, but yet for the sake of some temporal emolument has desired to be baptized in the Catholic unity, or, having been already baptized in it, is unwilling on account of the said emolument to secede from it, he is not only to be considered as seceding, but his offense is aggravated, in so far as to the error of heresy and the division of unity he adds the deceit of hypocrisy. Wherefore the depravity of each man, in proportion as it is more dangerous and wanting in straightforwardness, must be corrected with the more earnestness and energy; and yet, if he has anything that is good in him, especially if it be not of himself, but from God, we ought not to think it of no value because of his depravity, or to be blamed like it, or to be ascribed to it, rather than to His bountiful goodness, who even to a soul that plays the harlot, and goes after her lovers, yet gives His bread, and His wine, and His oil, and other food or ornaments, which are neither from herself nor from her lovers, but from Him who in compassion for her is even desirous to warn her to whom she should return.[fn-35-P3570_2007354:108-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_63_xiii_the_third_conference_of_abbot_chaeremon_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"45","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"And this care of His and providence with regard to us the Divine word has finely described by the prophet Hosea under the figure of Jerusalem as an harlot, and inclining with disgraceful eagerness to the worship of idols, where when she says: \"I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread, and my water, and my wool, and my flax, and my oil, and my drink;\" the Divine consideration replies having regard to her salvation and not to her wishes: \"Behold I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and I will stop it up with a wall, and she shall not find her paths.

But as a woman that despiseth her lover, so hath the house of Israel despised Me, saith the Lord.\"[fn-52-P5291_1902904:18-nf] Aptly then, as He has compared Jerusalem to an adulteress forsaking her husband, He compares His own love and persevering goodness to a man who is dying of love for a woman. For the goodness and love of God, which He ever shows to mankind,-since it is overcome by no injuries so as to cease from caring for our salvation, or be driven from His first intention, as if vanquished by our iniquities,-could not be more fitly described by any comparison than the case of a man inflamed with most ardent love for a woman, who is consumed by a more burning passion for her, the more he sees that he is slighted and despised by her. The Divine protection then is inseparably present with us, and so great is the kindness of the Creator towards His creatures, that His Providence not only accompanies it, but actually constantly precedes it, as the prophet experienced and plainly confessed, saying: \"My God will prevent me with His mercy.\"[fn-52-P5292_1903859:19-nf] And when He sees in us some beginnings of a good will, He at once enlightens it and strengthens it and urges it on towards salvation, increasing that which He Himself implanted or which He sees to have arisen from our own efforts. For He says \"Before they cry, I will hear them: While they are still speaking I will hear them;\" and again: \"As soon as He hears the voice of thy crying, He will answer thee.\"[fn-52-P5293_1904293:20-nf] And in His goodness, not only does He inspire us with holy desires, but actually creates occasions for life and opportunities for good results, and shows to those in error the direction of the way of salvation.","title":"XIII.
