{"verses":["In their affliction they will rise early to me:  Come, and let us\nreturn to the Lord.","For he hath taken us, and he will heal us:  he will strike, and he\nwill cure us.","He will revive us after two days:  on the third day he will raise\nus up, and we shall live in his sight.  We shall know, and we shall\nfollow on, that we may know the Lord.  His going forth is prepared as\nthe morning light, and he will come to us as the early and the latter\nrain to the earth.","What shall I do to thee, O Ephraim?  what shall I do to thee, O\nJuda?  your mercy is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that goeth away\nin the morning.","For this reason have I hewed them by the prophets, I have slain\nthem by the words of my mouth:  and thy judgments shall go forth as the\nlight.","For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice:  and the knowledge of God\nmore than holocausts.","But they, like Adam, have transgressed the covenant, there have\nthey dealt treacherously against me.","Galaad is a city of workers of idols, supplanted with blood.","And like the jaws of highway robbers, they conspire with the\npriests who murder in the way those that pass out of Sichem:  for they\nhave wrought wickedness.","I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel:  the\nfornications of Ephraim there:  Israel is defiled.","And thou also, O Juda, set thee a harvest, when I shall bring\nback the captivity of my people."]}
