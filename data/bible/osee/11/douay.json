{"verses":["As the morning passeth, so hath the king of Israel passed away.\nBecause Israel was a child, and I loved him:  and I called my son out of\nEgypt.","As they called them, they went away from before their face:  they\noffered victims to Baalim, and sacrificed to idols.","And I was like a foster father to Ephraim, I carried them in my\narms:  and they knew not that I healed them.","I will draw them with the cords of Adam, with the bands of love:\nand I will be to them as one that taketh off the yoke on their jaws:\nand I put his meat to him that he might eat.","He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian\nshall be his king:  because they would not be converted.","The sword hath begun in his cities, and it shall consume his\nchosen men, and shall devour their heads.","And my people shall long for my return:  but a yoke shall be put\nupon them together, which shall not be taken off.","How shall I deal with thee, O Ephraim, shall I protect thee, O\nIsrael?  how shall I make thee as Adama, shall I set thee as Seboim?  my\nheart is turned within me, my repentance is stirred up.","I will not execute the fierceness of my wrath:  I will not return\nto destroy Ephraim:  because I am God, and not man:  the holy one in the\nmidst of thee, and I will not enter into the city.","They shall walk after the Lord, he shall roar as a lion:  because\nhe shall roar, and the children of the sea shall fear.","And they shall fly away like a bird out of Egypt, and like a\ndove out of the land of the Assyrians:  and I will place them in their\nown houses, saith the Lord.","Ephraim hath compassed me about with denials, and the house of\nIsrael with deceit:  but Juda went down as a witness with God, and is\nfaithful with the saints."]}
