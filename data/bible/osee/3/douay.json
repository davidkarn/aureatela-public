{"verses":["And the Lord said to me:  Go yet again, and love a woman beloved of\nher friend, and an adulteress:  as the Lord loveth the children of\nIsrael, and they look to strange gods, and love the husks of the\ngrapes.","And I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for a\ncore of barley, and for half a core of barley.","And I said to her:  Thou shalt wait for me many days:  thou shalt\nnot play the harlot, and thou shalt be no man's, and I also will wait\nfor thee.","For the children of Israel shall sit many days without king, and\nwithout prince, and without sacrifice, and without altar, and without\nephod, and without theraphim.","And after this the children of Israel shall return and shall seek\nthe Lord, their God, and David, their king:  and they shall fear the\nLord, and his goodness, in the last days."]}
