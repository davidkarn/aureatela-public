{"verses":["Hear the word of the Lord, ye children of Israel, for the Lord\nshall enter into judgment with the inhabitants of the land:  for there\nis no truth, and there is no mercy, and there is no knowledge of God in\nthe land.","Cursing, and lying, and killing, and theft, and adultery, have\noverflowed, and blood hath touched blood.","Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth in it\nshall languish with the heat of the field, and with the fowls of the\nair:  yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be gathered together.","But yet let not any man judge:  and let not a man be rebuked:  for\nthy people are as they that contradict the priest.","And thou shalt fall today, and the prophet also shall fall with\nthee:  in the night I have made thy mother to be silent.","My people have been silent, because they had no knowledge:  because\nthou hast rejected knowledge, I will reject thee, that thou shalt not\ndo the office of priesthood to me:  and thou hast forgotten the law of\nthy God, I also will forget thy children.","According to the multitude of them, so have they sinned against\nme:  I will change their glory into shame.","They shall eat the sins of my people, and shall lift up their\nsouls to their iniquity.","And there shall be like people like priest:  and I will visit their\nways upon them, and I will repay them their devices.","And they shall eat and shall not be filled:  they have committed\nfornication, and have not ceased:  because they have forsaken the Lord\nin not observing the law.","Fornication, and wine, and drunkenness, take away the\nunderstanding.","My people have consulted their stocks, and their staff hath\ndeclared unto them:  for the spirit of fornication hath deceived them,\nand they have committed fornication against their God.","They offered sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burnt\nincense upon the hills:  under the oak, and the poplar, and the\nturpentine tree, because the shadow thereof was good:  therefore shall\nyour daughters commit fornication, aud your spouses shall be\nadulteresses.","I will not visit upon your daughters, when they shall commit\nfornication, and upon your spouses when they shall commit adultery:\nbecause themselves conversed with harlots, and offered sacrifice with\nthe effeminate, and the people that doth not understand shall be\nbeaten.","If thou play the harlot, O Israel, at least let not Juda offend:\nand go ye not into Galgal, and come not up into Bethaven, and do not\nswear:  The Lord liveth.","For Israel hath gone astray like a wanton heifer now will the\nLord feed them, as a lamb in a spacious place.","Ephraim is a partaker with idols, let him alone.","Their banquet is separated, they have gone astray by fornication:\nthey that should have protected them have loved to bring shame upon\nthem.","The wind hath bound them up in its wings, and they shall be\nconfounded because of their sacrifices."]}
