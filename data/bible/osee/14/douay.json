{"verses":["Let Samaria perish, because she hath stirred up her God to\nbitterness:  let them perish by the sword, let their little ones be\ndashed, and let the women with child be ripped up.","Return, O Israel, to the Lord thy God:  for thou hast fallen down\nby thy iniquity.","Take with you words, and return to the Lord, and say to him:  Take\naway all iniquity, and receive the good:  and we will render the calves\nof our lips.","Assyria shall not save us, we will not ride upon horses, neither\nwill we say any more:  The works of our hands are our gods:  for thou\nwilt have mercy on the fatherless that is in thee.","I will heal their breaches, I will love them freely:  for my wrath\nis turned away from them.","I will be as the dew, Israel shall spring as the lily, and his\nroot shall shoot forth as that of Libanus.","His branches shall spread, and his glory shall be as the olive\ntree:  and his smell as that of Libanus.","They shall be converted that sit under his shadow:  they shall\nlive upon wheat, and they shall blossom as a vine:  his memorial shall\nbe as the wine of Libanus.","Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols?  I will\nhear him, and I will make him flourish like a green fir tree:  from me\nis thy fruit found.","Who is wise, and he shall understand these things?  prudent, and\nhe shall know these things?  for the ways of the Lord are right, and the\njust shall walk in them:  but the transgressors shall fall in them."]}
