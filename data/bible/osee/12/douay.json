{"verses":["Ephraim feedeth on the wind, and followeth the burning heat:  all\nthe day long he multiplied lies and desolation:  and he hath made a\ncovenant with the Assyrians, and carried oil into Egypt.","Therefore there is a judgment of the Lord with Juda, and a\nvisitation for Jacob:  he will render to him according to his ways, and\naccording to his devices.","In the womb he supplanted his brother:  and by his strength he had\nsuccess with an angel.","And he prevailed over the angel, and was strengthened:  he wept,\nand made supplication to him:  he found him in Bethel, and there he\nspoke with us.","Even the Lord God of hosts, the Lord is his memorial.","Therefore turn thou to thy God:  keep mercy and judgment, and hope\nin thy God always.","He is like Chanaan, there is a deceitful balance in his hand, he\nhath loved oppression.","And Ephraim said:  But yet I am become rich, I have found me an\nidol:  all my labours shall not find me the iniquity that I have\ncommitted.","And I that am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt, will yet\ncause thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the feast.","And I have spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied\nvisions, and I have used similitudes by the ministry of the prophets.","If Galaad be an idol, then in vain were they in Galgal offering\nsacrifices with bullocks:  for their altars also are as heaps in the\nfurrows of the field.","Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a\nwife, and was a keeper for a wife.","But the Lord by a prophet brought Israel out of Egypt:  and he\nwas preserved by a prophet.","Ephraim hath provoked me to wrath with his bitterness, and his\nblood shall come upon him, and his Lord will render his reproach unto\nhim."]}
