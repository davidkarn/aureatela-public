{"verses":["The word of the Lord, that came to Osee, the son of Beeri, in the\ndays of Ozias, Joathan, Achaz, and Ezechias, kings of Juda, and in the\ndays of Jeroboam, the son of Joas, king of Israel.","The beginning of the Lord's speaking by Osee:  and the Lord said to\nOsee:  Go, take thee a wife of fornications, and have of her children of\nfornications:  for the land by fornication shall depart from the Lord.","So he went and took Gomer, the daughter of Debelaim:  and she\nconceived, and bore him a son.","And the Lord said to him:  Call his name Jezrahel:  for yet a little\nwhile, and I will visit the blood of Jezrahel upon the house of Jehu,\nand I will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.","And in that day I will break in pieces the bow of Israel in the\nvalley of Jezrahel.","And she conceived again, and bore a daughter, and he said to him:\nCall her name, Without mercy:  for I will not add any more to have mercy\non the house of Israel, but I will utterly forget them.","And I will have mercy on the house of Juda, and I will save them\nby the Lord, their God:  and I will not save them by bow, nor by sword,\nnor by battle, nor by horses, nor by horsemen.","And she weaned her that was called Without mercy.  And she\nconceived, and bore a son.","And he said:  Call his name, Not my people:  for you are not my\npeople, and I will not be yours.","And the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of\nthe sea, that is without measure, and shall not be numbered.  And it\nshall be in the place where it shall be said to them:  You are not my\npeople:  it shall be said to them:  Ye are the sons of the living God.","And the children of Juda, and the children of Israel, shall be\ngathered together:  and they shall appoint themselves one head, and\nshall come up out of the land:  for great is the day of Jezrahel."]}
