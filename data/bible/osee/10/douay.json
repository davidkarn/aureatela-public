{"verses":["Israel a vine full of branches, the fruit is agreeable to it:\naccording to the multitude of his fruit, he hath multiplied altars,\naccording to the plenty of his land he hath abounded with idols.","Their heart is divided:  now they shall perish:  he shall break\ndown their idols, he shall destroy their altars.","For now they shall say:  We have no king:  because we fear not the\nLord:  and what shall a king do to us?","You speak words of an unprofitable vision, and you shall make a\ncovenant:  and judgment shall spring up as bitterness in the furrows of\nthe field.","The inhabitants of Samaria have worshipped the kine of Bethaven:\nfor the people thereof have mourned over it, and the wardens of its\ntemple that rejoiced over it in its glory because it is departed from\nit.","For itself also is carried into Assyria, a present to the\navenging king:  shame shall fall upon Ephraim, and Israel shall be\nconfounded in his own will.","Samaria hath made her king to pass as froth upon the face of the\nwater.","And the high places of the idol, the sin of Israel shall be\ndestroyed:  the bur and the thistle shall grow up over their altars:  and\nthey shall say to the mountains Cover us; and to the hills:  Fall upon\nus.","From the days of Gabaa, Israel hath sinned, there they stood:  the\nbattle in Gabaa against the children of iniquity shall not overtake\nthem.","According to my desire, I will chastise them:  and the nations\nshall be gathered together against them, when they shall be chastised\nfor their two iniquities.","Ephraim is a heifer taught to love to tread out corn, but I\npassed over upon the beauty of her neck:  I will ride upon Ephraim, Juda\nshall plough, Jacob shall break the furrows for himself.","Sow for yourselves in justice, and reap in the mouth of mercy,\nbreak up your fallow ground:  but the time to seek the Lord is, when he\nshall come that shall teach you justice.","You have ploughed wickedness, you have reaped iniquity, you have\neaten the fruit of lying:  because thou hast trusted in thy ways, in the\nmultitude of thy strong ones.","A tumult shall arise among thy people:  and all thy fortresses\nshall be destroyed as Salmana was destroyed, by the house of him that\njudged Baal in the day of battle, the mother being dashed in pieces\nupon her children.","So hath Bethel done to you, because of the evil of your\niniquities."]}
