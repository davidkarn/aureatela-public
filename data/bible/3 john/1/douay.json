{"verses":["The Ancient, to the dearly beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.","Dearly beloved, concerning all things I make it my prayer that\nthou mayest proceed prosperously and fare well, as thy soul doth\nprosperously.","I was exceedingly glad when the brethren came and gave testimony\nto the truth in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.","I have no greater grace than this, to hear that my children walk\nin truth.","Dearly beloved, thou dost faithfully whatever thou dost for the\nbrethren:  and that for strangers,","Who have given testimony to thy charity in the sight of the\nchurch.  Whom thou shalt do well to bring forward on their way in a\nmanner worthy of God:","Because, for his name they went out, taking nothing of the\nGentiles.","We therefore ought to receive such:  that we may be fellow helpers\nof the truth.","I had written perhaps to the church:  but Diotrephes, who loveth to\nhave the preeminence among them, doth not receive us.","Dearly beloved, follow not that which is evil:  but that which is\ngood.  He that doth good is of God:  he that doth evil hath not seen God.","To Demetrius, testimony is given by all, and by the truth itself:\nyea and we also give testimony.  And thou knowest that our testimony is\ntrue.","I had many things to write unto thee:  but I would not by ink and\npen write to thee.","But I hope speedily to see thee:  and we will speak mouth to\nmouth.  Peace be to thee.  Our friends salute thee.  Salute the friends\nby name."]}
