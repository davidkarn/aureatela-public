We read in Isaiah the words, \"the fool will speak folly,\"[fn-55-P5533_1542598:3925-nf] and I am told that some one has been mad enough to put deacons before presbyters, that is, before bishops. For when the apostle clearly teaches that presbyters are the same as bishops, must not a mere server of tables and of widows[fn-55-P5534_1542858:3926-nf] be insane to set himself up arrogantly over men through whose prayers the body and blood of Christ are produced?[fn-55-P5535_1543004:3927-nf] Do you ask for proof of what I say? Listen to this passage: \"Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi with the bishops and deacons.\"[fn-55-P5536_1543283:3928-nf] Do you wish for another instance? In the Acts of the Apostles Paul thus speaks to the priests[fn-55-P5537_1543396:3929-nf] of a single church: \"Take heed unto yourselves and to all the flock, in the which the Holy Ghost hath made you bishops, to feed the church of God which He purchased with His own blood.\"[fn-55-P5538_1543603:3930-nf] And lest any should in a spirit of contention argue that there must then have been more bishops than one in a single church, there is the following passage which clearly proves a bishop and a presbyter to be the same. Writing to Titus the apostle says: \"For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain presbyters[fn-55-P5539_1544004:3931-nf] in every city, as I had appointed thee: if any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly. For a bishop must be blameless as the steward of God.\"[fn-55-P5540_1544227:3932-nf] And to Timothy he says: \"Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.\"[fn-55-P5541_1544398:3933-nf] Peter also says in his first epistle: \"The presbyters which are among you I exhort, who am your fellow-presbyter and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: feed the flock of Christ[fn-55-P5542_1544657:3934-nf] ...taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly, according unto God.\"[fn-55-P5543_1544766:3935-nf] In the Greek the meaning is still plainer, for the word used is episkopountej, that is to say, overseeing, and this is the origin of the name overseer or bishop.[fn-55-P5544_1544988:3936-nf] But perhaps the testimony of these great men seems to you insufficient. If so, then listen to the blast of the gospel trumpet, that son of thunder,[fn-55-P5545_1545156:3937-nf] the disciple whom Jesus loved[fn-55-P5546_1545209:3938-nf] and who reclining on the Saviour's breast drank in the waters of sound doctrine. One of his letters begins thus: \"The presbyter unto the elect lady and her children whom I love in the truth;\"[fn-55-P5547_1545425:3939-nf] and another thus: \"The presbyter unto the well-beloved Gains whom I love in the truth.\"[fn-55-P5548_1545532:3940-nf] When subsequently one presbyter was chosen to preside over the rest, this was done to remedy schism and to prevent each individual from rending the church of Christ by drawing it to himself. For even at Alexandria from the time of Mark the Evangelist until the episcopates of Heraclas and Dionysius the presbyters always named as bishop one of their own number chosen by themselves and set in a more exalted position, just as an army elects a general, or as deacons appoint one of themselves whom they know to be diligent and call him archdeacon. For what function, excepting ordination, belongs to a bishop that does not also belong to a presbyter? It is not the case that there is one church at Rome and another in all the world beside. Gaul and Britain, Africa and Persia, India and the East worship one Christ and observe one rule of truth. If you ask for authority, the world outweighs its capital.[fn-55-P5549_1546456:3941-nf] Wherever there is a bishop, whether it be at Rome or at Engubium, whether it be at Constantinople or at Rhegium, whether it be at Alexandria or at Zoan, his dignity is one and his priesthood is one. Neither the command of wealth nor the lowliness of poverty makes him more a bishop or less a bishop. All alike are successors of the apostles.[fn-55-P5550_1546829:3942-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_08_book_iii_","source_chapter":25,"source_paragraph":"224","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"17 But of the writings of John, not only his Gospel, but also the former of his epistles, has been accepted without dispute both now and in ancient times.[fn-19-P1917_877063:212-nf] But the other two are disputed.[fn-19-P1918_878394:213-nf] ","title":"Book III.","author":"Eusebius Pamphilus"},{"chapter":1,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_17_vi_on_monogamy_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"37","folder":"ANF-04","text":"These accordingly, I suppose, are they in whom my origin is counted.
