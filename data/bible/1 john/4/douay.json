{"verses":["Dearly beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits if\nthey be of God:  because many false prophets are gone out into the\nworld.","By this is the spirit of God known.  Every spirit which confesseth\nthat Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:","And every spirit that dissolveth Jesus is not of God.  And this is\nAntichrist, of whom you have heard that he cometh:  and he is now\nalready in the world.","You are of God, little children, and have overcome him.  Because\ngreater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.","They are of the world.  Therefore of the world they speak:  and the\nworld heareth them.","We are of God.  He that knoweth God heareth us.  He that is not of\nGod heareth us not.  By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit\nof error.","Dearly beloved, let us love one another:  for charity is of God.\nAnd every one that loveth is born of God and knoweth God.","He that loveth not knoweth not God:  for God is charity.","By this hath the charity of God appeared towards us, because God\nhath sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we may live by\nhim.","In this is charity:  not as though we had loved God, but because\nhe hath first loved us, and sent his Son to be a propitiation for our\nsins.","My dearest, if God hath so loved us, we also ought to love one\nanother.","No man hath seen God at any time.  If we love one another, God\nabideth in us:  and his charity is perfected in us.","In this we know that we abide in him, and he in us:  because he\nhath given us of his spirit.","And we have seen and do testify that the Father hath sent his Son\nto be the Saviour of the world.","Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth\nin him, and he in God.","And we have known and have believed the charity which God hath to\nus.  God is charity:  and he that abideth in charity abideth in God, and\nGod in him.","In this is the charity of God perfected with us, that we may have\nconfidence in the day of judgment:  because as he is, we also are in\nthis world.","Fear is not in charity:  but perfect charity casteth out fear,\nbecause fear hath sin.  And he that feareth is not perfected in charity.","Let us therefore love God:  because God first hath loved us.","If any man say:  I love God, and hateth his brother; he is a liar.\nFor he that loveth not his brother whom he seeth, how can he love God\nwhom he seeth not?","And this commandment we have from God, that he who loveth God\nlove also his brother."]}
