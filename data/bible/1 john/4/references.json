As though we, in asserting that He is one, say that He is desolate and solitary. Undoubtedly He has ministers, whom we call messengers. And that is true, which I have before related, that Seneca said in his Exhortations that God produced ministers of His kingdom. But these are neither gods, nor do they wish to be called gods or to be worshipped, inasmuch as they do nothing but execute the command and will of God. Nor, however, are they gods who are worshipped in common, whose number is small and fixed. But if the worshippers of the gods think that they worship those beings whom we call the ministers of the Supreme God, there is no reason why they should envy its who say that there is one God, and deny that there are many. If a multitude of gods delights them, we do not speak of twelve, or three hundred and sixty-five as Orpheus did; but we convict them of innumerable errors on the other side, in thinking that they are so few, Let them know, however, by what name they ought to be called, lest they do injury to the true God, whose name they set forth, while they assign it to more than one. Let them believe their own Apollo, who in that same response took away from the other gods their name, as he took away the dominion from Jupiter. For the third verse shows that the ministers of God ought not to be called gods, but angels. He spoke falsely respecting himself, indeed; for though he was of the number of demons, he reckoned himself among the angels of God, and then in other responses he confessed himself a demon. For when he was asked how he wished to be supplicated, he thus answered:-","title":"Book I.

Why do I still delay to relate the sequel? When her wedding day was now close at hand and when a marriage chamber was being got ready for the bride and bridegroom; secretly without any witnesses and with only the night to comfort her, she is said to have nerved herself with such considerations as these: \"What ails you, Demetrias? Why are you so fearful of defending your chastity? What you need is freedom and courage. If you are so panic-stricken in time of peace, what would you do if you were called on to undergo martyrdom? If you cannot bear so much as a frown from your own, how would you steel yourself to face the tribunals of persecutors?

Unhappy girl! you know not, you know not to whom your virginity is due. It is not long since you have trembled in the hands of the barbarians and clung to your grandmother and your mother cowering under their cloaks for safety. You have seen yourself a prisoner[fn-50-P5095_1404808:3633-nf] and your chastity not in your own power. You have shuddered at the fierce looks of your enemies; you have seen with secret agony the virgins of God ravished.

Perhaps they may themselves wish for you a course which they do not think you wish for yourself.\" When by these and other arguments she had wrought herself to the necessary pitch of resolution, she cast from her as so many hindrances all her ornaments and worldly attire. Her precious necklaces, costly pearls, and glowing gems she put back in their cases. Then dressing herself in a coarse tunic and throwing over herself a still courser cloak she came in at an unlooked for moment, threw herself down suddenly at her grandmother's knees, and with tears and sobs shewed her what she really was. That staid and holy woman was amazed when she beheld her granddaughter in so strange a dress. Her mother was completely overcome for joy. Both women could hardly believe that true which they had longed to be true.

Surely the man who says this is no ordinary blasphemer; the poison of his heresy is no common poison. Since our wills are free, they argue, we are no longer dependent upon God; and they forget the Apostle's words \"what hast thou that thou didst not receive? Now if thou didst receive it why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?\"[fn-53-P5351_1478312:3826-nf] A nice return, truly, does a man make to God when to assert the freedom of his will he rebels against Him! For our parts we gladly embrace this freedom, but we never forget to thank the Giver; knowing that we are powerless unless He continually preserves in us His own gift. As the apostle says, \"it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.\"[fn-53-P5352_1478720:3827-nf] To will and to run are mine, but they will cease to be mine unless God brings me His continual aid. For the same apostle says \"it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do.\"[fn-53-P5353_1478925:3828-nf] And in the Gospel the Saviour says: \"my Father worketh hitherto and I work.\"[fn-53-P5354_1479025:3829-nf] He is always a giver, always a bestower. It is not enough for me that he has given me grace once; He must give it me always. I seek that I may obtain, and when I have obtained I seek again. I am covetous of God's bounty; and as He is never slack in giving, so I am never weary in receiving. The more I drink, the more I thirst. For I have read the song of the psalmist: \"O taste and see that the Lord is good.\"[fn-53-P5355_1479457:3830-nf] Every good thing that we have is a tasting of the Lord.

Wherefore also the Holy Spirit consists in the same unity of substance, and in the same equality. For whether He is the unity of both, or the holiness, or the love, or therefore the unity because the love, and therefore the love because the holiness, it is manifest that He is not one of the two, through whom the two are joined, through whom the Begotten is loved by the Begetter, and loves Him that begat Him, and through whom, not by participation, but by their own essence, neither by the gift of any superior, but by their own, they are \"keeping the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace;\"[fn-11-P1131_465485:10-nf] which we are commanded to imitate by grace, both towards God and towards ourselves. \"On which two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\"[fn-11-P1132_465650:11-nf] So those three are God, one, alone, great, wise, holy, blessed. But we are blessed from Him, and through Him, and in Him; because we ourselves are one by His gift, and one spirit with Him, because our soul cleaves to Him so as to follow Him. And it is good for us to cleave to God, since He will destroy every man who is estranged from Him.[fn-11-P1133_466015:12-nf] Therefore the Ho!y Spirit, whatever it is, is something common both to the Father and Son. But that communion itself is consubstantial and co-eternal; and if it may fitly be called friendship, let it be so called; but it is more aptly called love. And this is also a substance, since God is a substance, and \"God is love,\" as it is written.[fn-11-P1134_466381:13-nf] But as He is a substance together with the Father and the Son, so that substance is together with them great, and together with them good, and together with them holy, and whatsoever else is said in reference to substance; since it is not one thing to God to be, and another to be great or to be good. and the rest, as we have shown above. For if love is less great therein [i.e. in God] than wisdom, then wisdom is loved in less degree than according to what it is; love is therefore equal, in order that wisdom may be loved according to its being; but wisdom is equal with the Father, as we have proved above; therefore also the Holy Spirit is equal; and if equal, equal in all things, off account of the absolute simplicity which is in that substance. And therefore they are not more than three: One who loves Him who is from Himself, and One who loves Him from whom He is, and Love itself. And if this last is nothing, how is \"God love\"?

And that no one may take it to his head to say that this applied properly to the Jews, and not to the world, did He not say in another place, \"If ye were of the world, the world would love his own\"?[fn-31-P3158_1768257:1-nf] Did He not reprove it of righteousness, when He said, \"O righteous Father, the world hath not known Thee\"?[fn-31-P3159_1768385:2-nf] And did He not reprove it of judgment when He declared that He would say to those on the left hand, \"Depart ye into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels\"?[fn-31-P3160_1768579:3-nf] And many other passages are to be found in the holy evangel, where Christ reproveth the world of these things. Why is it, then, He attributeth this to the Holy Spirit, as if it were His proper prerogative? Is it that, because Christ spake only among the nation of the Jews, He does not appear to have reproved the world, inasmuch as one may be understood to be reproved who actually hears the reprover; while the Holy Spirit, who was in His disciples when scattered throughout the whole world, is to be understood as having reproved not one nation, but the world? For mark what He said to them when about to ascend into heaven: \"It is not for you to know the times or the moments, which the Father hath put in His own power. But ye shall receive the power of the Holy Spirit, that cometh upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.\"[fn-31-P3161_1769520:4-nf] Surely this is to reprove the world.

We have frequently said, however, that the operations of the Trinity are inseparable;[fn-31-P3165_1770465:8-nf] but the Persons needed to be set forth one by one, that not only without separating Them, but also without confounding Them together, we may have a right understanding both of Their Unity and Trinity.","title":"Tractate XCV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_07_the_dialogue_against_the_luciferians","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"85","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"23.

No other thing, then, is chiefly to be regarded in this inquiry, which we make concerning the Trinity and concerning knowing God, except what is true love, nay, rather what is love. For that is to be called love which is true, otherwise it is desire; and so those who desire are said improperly to love, just as they who love are said improperly to desire. But this is true love, that cleaving to the truth we may live righteously, and so may despise all mortal things in comparison with the love of men, whereby we wish them to live righteously. For so we should be prepared also to die profitably for our brethren, as our Lord Jesus Christ taught us by His example. For as there are two commandments on which hang all the Law and the prophets, love of God and love of our neighbor;[fn-12-P1275_570944:16-nf] not without cause the Scripture mostly puts one for both: whether it be of God only, as is that text, \"For we know that all things work together for good to them that love God;\"[fn-12-P1276_571146:17-nf] and again, \"But if any man love God, the same is known of Him;[fn-12-P1277_571229:18-nf] and that, \"Because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us;\"[fn-12-P1278_571357:19-nf] and many other passages; because he who loves God must both needs do what God has commanded, and loves Him just in such proportion as he does so; therefore he must needs also love his neighbor, because God has commanded it: or whether it be that Scripture only mentions the love of our neighbor, as in that text, \"Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ;\"[fn-12-P1279_571753:20-nf] and again, \"For all the law is fufilled in one word, even in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself;\"[fn-12-P1280_571879:21-nf] and in the Gospel, \"All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the Law and the prophets.\"[fn-12-P1281_572036:22-nf] And many other passages occur in the sacred writings, in which only the love of our neighbor seems to be commanded for perfection, while the love of God is passed over in silence; whereas the Law and the prophets hang on both precepts. But this, too, is because be who loves his neighbor must needs also love above all else love itself.

Wherefore they who seek God through those Powers which rule over the world, or parts of the world, are removed and cast away far from Him; not by intervals of space, but by difference of affections: for they endeavor to find a path outwardly, and forsake their own inward things, within which is God. Therefore, even although they may either have heard some holy heavenly Power, or in some way or another may have thought of it, yet they rather covet its deeds at which human weakness marvels, but do not imitate the piety by which divine rest is acquired. For they prefer, through pride, to be able to do that which an angel does, more than, through devotion, to be that which an angel is. For no holy being rejoices in his own power, but in His from whom he has the power which he filly can have; and he knows it to be more a mark of power to be united to the Omnipotent by a pious will, than to be able, by his own power and will, to do what they may tremble at who are not able to do such things. Therefore the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, in doing such things, in order that He might teach better things to those who marvelled at them, and might turn those who were intent and in doubt about unusual temporal things to eternal and inner things, says, \"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you.\" And He does not say, Learn of me, because I raise those who have been dead four days; but He says, \"Learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart.\" For humility, which is most solid, is more powerful and safer than pride, that is most inflated.

He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love.\" And this passage declares sufficiently and plainly, that this same brotherly love itself (for that is brotherly love by which we love each other) is set forth by so great authority, not only to be from God, but also to be God. When, therefore, we love our brother from love, we love our brother from God; neither can it be that we do not love above all else that same love by which we love our brother: whence it may be gathered that these two commandments cannot exist unless interchangeably.

And let us seek to understand this, praying for help from Himself, whom we wish to understand; and as much as He grants, desiring to explain what we understand with so much pious care and anxiety, that even if in any case we say one thing for another, we may at least say nothing unworthy.

Even as now our wish is to see whether the Holy Spirit is properly that love which is most excellent which if He is not, either the Father is love, or the Son, or the Trinity itself; since we cannot withstand the most certain faith and weighty authority of Scripture, saying, \"God is love.\"[fn-13-P1320_588079:9-nf] And yet we ought not to deviate into profane error, so as to say anything of the Trinity which does not suit the Creator, but rather the creature, or which is feigned outright by mere empty thought.","title":"Book IX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_10_book_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"40.

These are they who have not defiled themselves with women, for they continued virgins. These follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth: for they were redeemed from among men, first-fruits to God and to the Lamb, and in their mouth was found no guile, and they are without spot.\"[fn-64-P6488_2010399:316-nf] Out of each tribe, the tribe of Dan excepted, the place of which is taken by the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand virgins who have been sealed are spoken of as future believers, who have not defiled themselves with women. And that we may not suppose the reference to be to those who know not harlots, he immediately added: \"For they continued virgins.\" Whereby he shows that all who have not preserved their virginity, in comparison of pure and angelic chastity and of our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, are defiled.[fn-64-P6489_2010933:317-nf] \"These are they who sing a new song which no man can sing except him that is a virgin. These are first-fruits unto God and unto the Lamb, and are without blemish.\" If virgins are first-fruits, it follows that widows and the continent in marriage, come after the first-fruits, that is, are in the second and third rank: nor can a lost people be saved unless it offer such sacrifices of chastity to God, and with pure victims reconcile the spotless Lamb. It would be endless work to explain the Gospel mystery of the ten virgins, five of whom were wise and five foolish. All I say now is, that as mere virginity without other works does not save, so all works without virginity, purity, continence, chastity, are imperfect. And we shall not be hindered in the least from taking this view by the objection of our opponent that our Lord was at Cana of Galilee, and joined in the marriage festivities when He turned water into wine. I shall very briefly reply, that He Who was circumcised on the eighth day, and for Whom a pair of turtle-doves and two young pigeons were offered on the day of purification, like others before He suffered, shewed His approval of Jewish custom, that He might not seem to give His enemies just cause for putting Him to death on the pretext that He destroyed the law and condemned nature. And even this was done for our sakes. For by going once to a marriage, He taught that men should marry only once. Moreover, at that time it was possible to injure virginity if marriage were not placed next to it, and the purity of widowhood in the third rank. But now when heretics are condemning wedlock, and despise the ordinance of God, we gladly hear anything he[fn-64-P6490_2012650:318-nf] may say in praise of marriage. For the Church does not condemn marriage, but makes it subordinate; nor does she reject it, but regulates it; for she knows, as was said before, that[fn-64-P6491_2012855:319-nf] in a great house there are notonly vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and earthenware; and that some are to honour, some to dishonour; and that whoever cleanses himself will be a vessel of honour, necessary, prepared for every good work.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":4,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_12_book_vii_","source_chapter":33,"source_paragraph":"149","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"Nestorius had an associate whom he had brought from Antioch, a presbyter named Anastasius; for this man he had the highest esteem, and consulted him in the management of his most important affairs. This Anastasius preaching one day in the church said, `Let no one call Mary Theotocos:[fn-21-P2195_948622:100-nf] for Mary was but a woman;[fn-21-P2196_948744:101-nf] and it is impossible that God should be born of a woman.' These words created a great sensation, and troubled many both of the clergy and laity; they having been heretofore taught to acknowledge Christ as God, and by no means to separate his humanity from his divinity on account of the economy of incarnation, heeding the voice of the apostle when he said, `Yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh; yet now henceforth know we him no more.'[fn-21-P2197_949228:102-nf] And again, `Wherefore, leaving the word of the beginning of Christ, let us go on unto perfection.'[fn-21-P2198_949348:103-nf] While great offense was taken in the church, as we have said, at what was thus propounded, Nestorius, eager to establish Anastasius' proposition-for he did not wish to have the man who was esteemed by himself found guilty of blasphemy-delivered several public discourses on the subject, in which he assumed a controversial attitude, and totally rejected the epithet Theotocos. Wherefore the controversy on the subject being taken in one spirit by some and in another by others, the discussion which ensued divided the church, and resembled the struggle of combatants in the dark, all parties uttering the most confused and contradictory assertions. Nestorius thus acquired the reputation among the masses of asserting the blasphemous dogma that the Lord is a mere man, and attempting to foist on the Church the dogmas of Paul of Samosata and Photinus; and so great a clamor was raised by the contention that it was deemed requisite to convene a general council to take cognizance of the matter in dispute. Having myself perused the writings of Nestorius, I have found him an unlearned man and shall candidly express the conviction of my own mind concerning him: and as in entire freedom from personal antipathies, I have already alluded to his faults, I shall in like manner be unbiassed by the criminations of his adversaries, to derogate from his merits. I cannot then concede that he was either a follower of Paul of Samosata or of Photinus, or that he denied the Divinity of Christ: but he seemed scared at the term Theotocos, as though it were some terrible phantom.[fn-21-P2199_950940:104-nf] The fact is, the cause-less alarm he manifested on this subject just exposed his extreme ignorance: for being a man of natural fluency as a speaker, he was considered well educated, but in reality he was disgracefully illiterate. In fact he contemned the drudgery of an accurate examination of the ancient expositors: and, puffed up with his readiness of expression, he did not give his attention to the ancients, but thought himself the greatest of all. Now he was evidently unacquainted with the fact that in the First Catholic epistle of John it was written in the ancient copies,[fn-22-P2200_951572:105-nf] `Every spirit that separates Jesus, is not of God.' The mutilation of this passage[fn-22-P2201_952045:106-nf] is attributable to those who desired to separate the Divine nature from the human economy: or to use the very language of the early interpreters, some persons have corrupted this epistle, aiming at `separating the manhood of Christ from his Deity.' But the humanity is united to the Divinity in the Saviour, so as to constitute not two persons but one only. Hence it was that the ancients, emboldened by this testimony, scrupled not to style Mary Theotocos. For thus Eusebius Pamphilus in his third book of the Life of Constantine[fn-22-P2202_952760:107-nf] writes in these terms:","title":"Book VII.","author":"Socrates Scholasticus"},{"chapter":4,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_11_book_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"42","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"29. It is mere trifling to quote the passage:[fn-68-P6867_2188545:244-nf] \"Know ye not that your bodies are a temple of the Holy Ghost,\" for it is customary in Holy Scripture to speak of a single object as though it were many, and of many as though they were one. And Jovinianus himself should know that even in a temple there are many divisions-the outer and the inner courts, the vestibules, the holy place, and the Holy of Holies. There are also in a temple kitchens, pantries, oil-cellars, and cupboards for the vessels. And so in the temple of our body there are different degrees of merit. God does not dwell in all alike, nor does He impart Himself to all in the same degree. A portion of the spirit of Moses was taken and given to the seventy elders. I suppose there is a difference between the abundance of the river, and that of the rivulets.[fn-68-P6868_2189346:245-nf] Elijah's spirit was given in double measure to Elisha, and thus double grace wrought greater miracles. Elijah while living restored a dead man to life; Elisha after death did the same. Elijah invoked famine on the people; Elisha in a single day put the enemy's forces in the power of the city which they besieged. No doubt the words, \"Know ye not that your bodies are a temple of the Holy Ghost,\" refer to the whole assembly of the faithful, who, joined together, make up the one body of Christ. But the question now is, who in the body is worthy to be the feet of Christ, and who the head? who is His eye, and who His hand? -a distinction indicated by the[fn-68-P6869_2190089:246-nf] two women in the Gospel, the penitent and the holy woman,one of whom held His feet, the other His head. Some authorities. however, think there was only one woman, and that she who began at His feet gradually advanced to His head. Jovinianus further urges against us our Lord's words,[fn-68-P6870_2190437:247-nf] \"I pray not for these only, but also for those who shall believe on me through their word: that as I, Father, in thee and thou in me are one, so they all may be one in us,\" and reminds us that the whole Christian people is one in God, and, as His well-beloved sons, are[fn-68-P6871_2190747:248-nf] \"partakers of the divine nature.\" We have already said, and the truth must now be inculcated more in detail, that we are not one in the Father and the Son according to nature, but according to grace. For the essence of the human soul and the essence of God are not the same, as the Manichaeans constantly assert. But, says our Lord:[fn-68-P6872_2191100:249-nf] \"Thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me.\" You see, then, that we are privileged to partake of His essence, not in the realm of nature, but of grace, and the reason why we are beloved of the Father is that He has loved the Son; and the members are loved, those namely of the body.[fn-68-P6873_2191409:250-nf] \"For as many as received Christ, to them gave He power to become sons of God, even to them that believe on His name: which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.\" The Word was made flesh that we might pass from the flesh into the Word. The Word did not cease to be what He had been; nor did the human nature lose that which it was by birth. The glory was increased, the nature was not changed. Do you ask how we are made one body with Christ?Your creator shall be your instructor:[fn-68-P6874_2191975:251-nf] \"He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me, and I in him. As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so he that eateth me, he also shall live because of me. This is the bread which came down out of heaven.\" But the Evangelist John, who had drunk in wisdom from the breast of Christ, agrees herewith, and says:[fn-68-P6875_2192350:252-nf] \"Hereby know we that we abide in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God.\" If you believe in Christ, as the apostles believed, you shall be made one body with them in Christ.

In order, however, that this love may be possessed, even as far as it can possibly be possessed in the body of this death, the determination of will avails but little, unless it be helped by God's grace through our Lord Jesus Christ.

Neither, indeed, on the one hand, would any injunctions be laid upon us to keep them, if our own will had nothing to do in the matter; nor, on the other hand, would there be any room for prayer, if our will were alone sufficient. God's commandments, therefore, are commended to us as being not grievous, in order that he to whom they are grievous may understand that he has not as yet received the gift which removes their grievousness; and that he may not think that he is really performing them, when he so keeps them that they are grievous to him. For it is a cheerful giver whom God loves.[fn-25-P2555_1022266:93-nf] Nevertheless, when a man finds God's commandments grievous, let him not be broken down by despair; let him rather oblige himself to seek, to ask, and to knock","title":"Concerning Man's Perfection in Righteousness","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_107_tractate_cii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"5. \"For the Father Himself,\" He says, \"loveth you, because ye have loved me.\" Is it the case, then, that He loveth, because we love; or rather, that we love, because He loveth?

For under the name of \"clean fear\" David signifies that will by which we shall necessarily shrink from sin, and guard against it, not with the anxiety of weakness, which fears that we may strongly sin, but with the tranquillity of perfect love. Or if no kind of fear at all shall exist in that most imperturbable security of perpetual and blissful delights, then the expression, \"The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever,\" must be taken in the same sense as that other, \"The patience of the poor shall not perish for ever\"[fn-24-P2413_1342998:83-nf] For patience, which is necessary only where ills are to be borne, shall not be eternal, but that which patience leads us to will be eternal.

The teaching of the apostles was surely in everything according to the mind of God: they forgot and omitted nothing of the Gospel. Where, then, do you show that they renewed the command to flee from city to city? In fact, it was utterly impossible that they should have laid down anything so utterly opposed to their own examples as a command to flee, while it was just from bonds, or the islands in which, for confessing, not fleeing from the Christian name, they were confined, they wrote their letters to the Churches. Paul[fn-19-P1974_594332:34-nf] bids us support the weak, but most certainly it is not when they flee. For how can the absent be supported by you? By bearing with them? Well, he says that people must be supported, if anywhere they have committed a fault through the weakness of their faith, just as (he enjoins) that we should comfort the faint-hearted; he does not say, however, that they should be sent into exile. But when he urges us not to give place to evil,[fn-19-P1975_594786:35-nf] he does not offer the suggestion that we should take to our heels, he only teaches that passion should be kept under restraint; and if he says that the time must be redeemed, because the days are evil,[fn-19-P1976_595006:36-nf] he wishes us to gain a lengthening of life, not by flight, but by wisdom. Besides, he who bids us shine as sons of light,[fn-19-P1977_595145:37-nf] does not bid us hide away out of sight as sons of darkness. He commands us to stand stedfast,[fn-19-P1978_595259:38-nf] certainly not to act an opposite. part by fleeing; and to be girt, not to play the fugitive or oppose the Gospel. He points out weapons, too, which persons who intend to run away would not require. And among these he notes the shield[fn-19-P1979_595513:39-nf] too, that ye may be able to quench the darts of the devil, when doubtless ye resist him, and sustain his assaults in their utmost force. Accordingly John also teaches that we must lay down our lives for the brethren;[fn-19-P1980_595748:40-nf] much more, then, we must do it for the Lord. This cannot be fulfilled by those who flee. Finally, mindful of his own Revelation, in which he had heard the doom of the fearful, (and so) speaking from personal knowledge, he warns us that fear must be put away. \"There is no fear,\" says he, \"in love; but perfect love casteth out fear; because fear has torment\"-the fire of the lake, no doubt. \"He that feareth is not perfect in love\"[fn-19-P1981_596201:41-nf] -to wit, the love of God. And yet who will flee from persecution, but he who fears? Who will fear, but he who has not loved? Yes; and if you ask counsel of the Spirit, what does He approve more than that utterance of the Spirit? For, indeed, it incites all almost to go and offer themselves in martyrdom, not to flee from it; so that we also make mention of it. If you are exposed to public infamy, says he, it is for your good; for he who is not exposed to dishonour among men is sure to be so before the Lord. Do not be ashamed; righteousness brings you forth into the public gaze. Why should you be ashamed of gaining glory? The opportunity is given you when you are before the eyes of men.

In the first book, the unity and equality of that highest Trinity is shown from Holy Scripture. In the second, and third, and fourth, the same: but a careful handling of the question respecting the sending of the Son and of the Holy Spirit has resulted in three books; and we have demonstrated, that He who is sent is not therefore less than He who sends because the one sent, the other was sent; since the Trinity, which is in all things equal, being also equally in its own nature unchangeable, and invisible, and everywhere present, works indivisibly. In the fifth,-with a view to those who think that the substance of the Father and of the Son is therefore not the same, because they suppose everything that is predicated of God to be predicated according to substance, and therefore contend that to beget and to be begotten, or to be begotten and unbegotten, as being diverse, are diverse substances,-it is demonstrated that not everything that is predicated of God is predicated according to substance, as He is called good and great according to substance, or anything else that is predicated of Him in respect to Himself, but that some things also are predicated relatively, i.e. not in respect to Himself, but in respect to something which is not Himself; as He is called the Father in respect to the Son, or the Lord in respect to the creature that serves Him; and that here, if anything thus relatively predicated, i.e. predicated in respect to something that is not Himself, is predicated also as in time, as, e.g., \"Lord, Thou hast become our refuge,\"[fn-19-P1919_954967:10-nf] then nothing happens to Him so as to work a change in Him, but He Himself continues altogether unchangeable in His own nature or essence. In the sixth, the question how Christ is called by the mouth of the apostle \"the power of God and the wisdom of God,\"[fn-19-P1920_955239:11-nf] is so far argued that the more careful handling of that question is deferred, viz. whether He from whom Christ is begotten is not wisdom Himself, but only the father of His own wisdom, or whether wisdom begat wisdom. But be it which it may, the equality of the Trinity became apparent in this book also, and that God was not triple, but a Trinity; and that the Father and the Son are not, as it were, a double as opposed to the single Holy Spirit: for therein three are not anything more than one. We considered, too, how to understand the words of Bishop Hilary, \"Eternity in the Father, form in the Image, use in the Gift.\" In the seventh, the question is explained which had been deferred: in what way that God who begat the Son is not only Father of His own power and wisdom, but is Himself also power and wisdom; so, too, the Holy Spirit; and yet that they are not three powers or three wisdoms, but one power and one wisdom, as one God and one essence. It was next inquired, in what way they are called one essence, three persons, or by some Greeks one essence, three substances; and we found that the words were so used through the needs of speech, that there might be one term by which to answer, when it is asked what the three are, whom we truly confess to be three, viz. Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit. In the eighth, it is made plain by reason also to those who understand, that not only the Father is not greater than the Son in the substance of truth, but that both together are not anything greater than the Holy Spirit alone, nor that any two at all in the same Trinity are anything greater than one, nor all three together anything greater than each severally. Next, I have pointed out, that by means of the truth, which is beheld by the understanding, and by means of the highest good, from which is all good, and by means of the righteousness for which a righteous mind is loved even by a mind not yet righteous, we might understand, so far as it is possible to understand, that not only incorporeal but also unchangeable nature which is God; and by means, too, of love, which in the Holy Scriptures is called God,[fn-19-P1921_957395:12-nf] by which, first of all, those who have understanding begin also, however feebly, to discern the Trinity, to wit, one that loves, and that which is loved, and love. In the ninth, the argument advances as far as to the image of God, viz. man in respect to his mind; and in this we found a kind of trinity, i.e. the mind, and the knowledge whereby the mind knows itself, and the love whereby it loves both itself and its knowledge of itself; and these three are shown to be mutually equal, and of one essence. In the tenth, the same subject is more carefully and subtly handled, and is brought to this point, that we found in the mind a still more manifest trinity of the mind, viz. in memory, and understanding, and will. But since it turned out also, that the mind could never be in such a case as not to remember, understand, and love itself, although it did not always think of itself; but that when it did think of itself, it did not in the same act of thought distinguish itself from things corporeal; the argument respecting the Trinity, of which this is an image, was deferred, in order to find a trinity also in the things themselves that are seen with the body, and to exercise the reader's attention more distinctly in that. Accordingly, in the eleventh, we chose the sense of sight, wherein that which should have been there found to hold good might be recognized also in the other four bodily senses. although not expressly mentioned; and so a trinity of the outer man first showed itself in those things which are discerned from without, to wit, from the bodily object which is seen, and from the form which is thence impressed upon the eye of the beholder, and from the purpose of the will combining the two. But these three things, as was patent, were not mutually equal and of one substance. Next, we found yet another trinity in the mind itself, introduced into it, as it were, by the things perceived from without; wherein the same three things, as it appeared, were of one substance: the image of the bodily object which is in the memory, and the form thence impressed when the mind's eye of the thinker is turned to it, and the purpose of the will combining the two. But we found this trinity to pertain to the outer man, on this account, that it was introduced into the mind from bodily objects which are perceived from without. In the twelfth, we thought good to distinguish wisdom from knowledge, and to seek first, as being the lower of the two, a kind of appropriate and special trinity in that which is specially called knowledge; but that although we have got now in this to something pertaining to the inner man, yet it is not yet to be either called or thought an image of God. And this is discussed in the thirteenth book by the commendation of Christian faith. In the fourteenth we discuss the true wisdom of man, viz. that which is granted him by God's gift in the partaking of that very God Himself, which is distinct from knowledge; and the discussion reached this point, that a trinity is discovered in the image of God, which is man in respect to his mind, which mind is \"renewed in the knowledge\" of God,\"after the image of Him that created\" man;[fn-19-P1922_960598:13-nf] \"after His own image;\"[fn-19-P1923_960640:14-nf] and so obtains wisdom,wherein is the contemplation of things eternal.","title":"Book XV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_21_book_xv_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"10. For if we recall where it was in these books that a trinity first began to show itself to our understanding, the eighth book is that which occurs to us; since it was there that to the best of our power we tried to raise the aim of the mind to understand that most excellent and unchangeable nature, which our mind is not. And we so contemplated this nature as to think of it as not far from us, and as above us, not in place, but by its own awful and wonderful excellence, and in such wise that it appeared to be with us by its own present light. Yet in this no trinity was yet manifest to us, because in that blaze of light we did not keep the eye of the mind steadfastly bent upon seeking it; only we discerned it in a sense, because there was no bulk wherein we must needs think the magnitude of two or three to be more than that of one. But when we came to treat of love, which in the Holy Scriptures is called God,[fn-19-P1941_971165:21-nf] then a trinity began to dawn upon us a little, i.e. one that loves, and that which is loved, and love. But because that ineffable light beat back our gaze, and it became in some degree plain that the weakness of our mind could not as yet be tempered to it, we turned back in the midst of the course we had begun, and planned according to the (as it were) more familiar consideration of our own mind, according to which man is made after the image of God,[fn-19-P1942_971640:22-nf] in order to relieve our overstrained attention; and thereupon we dwelt from the ninth to the fourteenth book upon the consideration of the creature, which we are, that we might the able to understand and behold the invisible things of God by those things which are made. And now that we have exercised the understanding, as far as was needful, or perhaps more than was needful, in lower things, lo! we wish, but have not strength, to raise ourselves to behold that highest Trinity which is God. For in such manner as we see most undoubted trinities, whether those which are wrought from without by corporeal things, or when these same things are thought of which were perceived from without; or when those things which take their rise in the mind, and do not pertain to the senses of the body, as faith, or as the virtues which comprise the art of living, are discerned by manifest reason, and, held fast by knowledge; or when the mind itself, by which we know whatever we truly say that we know, is known to itself, or thinks of itself; or when that mind beholds anything eternal and unchangeable, which itself is not;-in such way, then, I say, as we see in all these instances most undoubted trinities, because they are wrought in ourselves, or are in ourselves, when we remember, look at, or desire these things;-do we, I say, in such manner also see the Trinity that is God; because there also, by the understanding, we behold both Him as it were speaking, and His Word, i.e. the Father and the Son; and then, proceeding thence, the love common to both, namely, the Holy Spirit? These trinities that pertain to our senses or to our mind, do we rather see than believe them, but rather believe than see that God is a trinity? But if this is so, then doubtless we either do not at all understand and behold the invisible things of God by those things that are made, or if we behold them at all, we do not behold the Trinity in them; and there is therein somewhat to behold, and somewhat also which we ought to believe, even though not beheld. And as the eighth book showed that we behold the unchangeable good which we are not, so the fourteenth reminded us thereof, when we spoke of the wisdom that man has from God. Why, then, do we not recognize the Trinity therein? Does that wisdom which God is said to be, not perceive itself, and not love itself? Who would say this? Or who is there that does not see, that where there is no knowledge, there in no way is there wisdom? Or are we, in truth, to think that the Wisdom which is God knows other things, and does not know itself; or loves other things, and does not love itself? But if this is a foolish and impious thing to say or believe, then behold we have a trinity,-to wit, wisdom, and the knowledge wisdom has of itself, and its love of itself. For so, too, we find a trinity in man also, i.e. mind, and the knowledge wherewith mind knows itself, and the love wherewith it loves itself.","title":"Book XV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_21_book_xv_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"78","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"27. We have sufficiently spoken of the Father and of the Son, so far as was possible for us to see through this glass and in this enigma. We must now treat of the Holy Spirit, so far as by God's gift it is permitted to see Him. And the Holy Spirit, according to the Holy Scriptures, is neither of the Father alone, nor of the Son alone, but of both; and so intimates to us a mutual love, wherewith the Father and the Son reciprocally love one another. But the language of the Word of God, in order to exercise us, has caused those things to be sought into with the greater zeal, which do not lie on the surface, but are to be scrutinized in hidden depths, and to be drawn out from thence. The Scriptures, accordingly, have not said, The Holy Spirit is Love. If they had said so, they would have done away with no small part of this inquiry. But they have said, \"God is love;\"[fn-20-P2024_1028401:61-nf] so that it is uncertain and remains to be inquired whether God the Father is love, or God the Son, or God the Holy Ghost, or the Trinity itself which is God.

As, then, we call the only Word of God specially by the name of Wisdom, although universally both the Holy Spirit and the Father Himself is wisdom; so the Holy Spirit is specially called by the name of Love, although universally both the Father and the Son are love. But the Word of God, i.e. the only-begotten Son of God, is expressly called the Wisdom of God by the mouth of the apostle, where he says, \"Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.\"[fn-20-P2040_1035249:73-nf] But where the Holy Spirit is called Love, is to be found by careful scrutiny of the language of John the apostle, who, after saying, \"Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God,\" has gone on to say, \"And every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love.\" Here, manifestly, he has called that love God, which he said was of God; therefore God of God is love. But because both the Son is born of God the Father, and the Holy Spirit proceeds from God the Father, it is rightly asked which of them we ought here to think is the rather called the love that is God. For the Father only is so God as not to be of God; and hence the love that is so God as to be of God, is either the Son or the Holy Spirit. But when, in what follows, the apostle had mentioned the love of God, not that by which we love Him, but that by which He \"loved us, and sent His Son to be a propitiator for our sins,\"[fn-20-P2041_1036223:74-nf] and thereupon had exhorted us also to love one another, and that so God would abide in us,-because, namely, he had called God Love; immediately, in his wish to speak yet more expressly on the subject, \"Hereby,\" he says, \"know we that we dwell in Him, and He in us, because He hath given us of His Spirit.\" Therefore the Holy Spirit, of whom He hath given us, makes us to abide in God, and Him in us; and this it is that love does. Therefore He is the God that is love. Lastly, a little after, when he had repeated the same thing, and had said \"God is love,\" he immediately subjoined, \"And he who abideth in love, abideth in God, and God abideth in him;\" whence he had said above, \"Hereby we know that we abide in Him, and He in us, because He hath given us of His Spirit.\" He therefore is signified, where we read that God is love. Therefore God the Holy Spirit, who proceedeth from the Father, when He has been given to man, inflames him to the love of God and of his neighbor, and is Himself love. For man has not whence to love God, unless from God; and therefore he says a little after, \"Let us love Him, because He first loved us.\"[fn-20-P2042_1037378:75-nf] The Apostle Paul, too, says, \"The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us.\"[fn-20-P2043_1037519:76-nf] ","title":"Book XV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_24_the_prescription_against_heretics_","source_chapter":35,"source_paragraph":"115","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Besides all this, I add a review of the doctrines themselves, which, existing as they did in the days of the apostles, were both exposed and denounced by the said apostles.

Paul, in his first epistle to the Corinthians, sets his mark on certain who denied and doubted the resurrection.[fn-35-P3572_1214946:344-nf] This opinion was the especial property of the Sadducees.[fn-35-P3573_1215025:345-nf] A part of it, however, is maintained by Marcion and Apelles and Valentinus, and all other impugners of the resurrection.

(The apostle) directs a similar blow[fn-35-P3576_1215554:348-nf] against those who said that \"the resurrection was past already.\"[fn-35-P3577_1215640:349-nf] Such an opinion did the Valentinians assert of themselves.

From these primary eight[fn-35-P3582_1216142:354-nf] ten other ¦ons after them spring, and then the twelve others arise with their wonderful names, to complete the mere story of the thirty ¦ons. The same apostle, when disapproving of those who are \"in bondage to elements,\"[fn-35-P3583_1216440:355-nf] points us to some dogma of Hermogenes, who introduces matter as having no beginning,[fn-35-P3584_1216544:356-nf] and then compares it with God, who has no beginning.[fn-35-P3585_1216649:357-nf] By thus making the mother of the elements a goddess, he has it in his power \"to be in bondage\" to a being which he puts on a par with[fn-35-P3586_1216804:358-nf] God.

For although God's commandment appears sometimes to be kept by those who do not love Him, but only fear Him; yet where there is no love, no good work is imputed, nor is there any good work, rightly so called; because \"whatsoever is not of faith is sin,\"[fn-33-P3357_1298605:76-nf] and \"faith worketh by love.\"[fn-33-P3358_1298653:77-nf] Hence also that grace of God, whereby \"His love is shed abroad in our hearts through the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us,\"[fn-33-P3359_1298795:78-nf] must be so confessed by the man who would make a true confession, as to show his undoubting belief that nothing whatever in the way of goodness pertaining to godliness and real holiness can be accomplished without it. Not after the fashion of him who clearly enough shows us what he thinks of it when he says, that \"grace is bestowed in order that what God commands may be the more easily fulfilled;\" which of course means, that even without grace God's commandments may, although less easily, yet actually, be accomplished.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_22_book_i_","source_chapter":57,"source_paragraph":"169","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"He ought, moreover, carefully to note that, in the very same context from which he quoted that passage of Ambrose's, which seemed so satisfactory for his purpose, he also said this: \"To be spotless from the beginning is an impossibility to human nature.\"[fn-35-P3504_1341146:139-nf] In this sentence the venerable Ambrose does undoubtedly predicate feebleness and infirmity of that natural \"capacity,\" which Pelagius refuses faithfully to regard as corrupted by sin, and therefore boastfully extols.

Now of these two, that is, \"giving the vow to him that voweth,\" and \"He hath blessed the years of the just,\" the one is what we do, the other what we receive. But this other is not received from God, the liberal giver, until He, the helper, Himself has enabled us for the former; \"for man is not mighty in strength.\" \"The Lord shall make his adversary weak,\" to wit, him who envies the man that vows, and resists him, lest he should fulfill what he has vowed. Owing to the ambiguity of the Greek, it may also be understood \"his own adversary.\" For when God has begun to possess us, immediately he who had been our adversary becomes His, and is conquered by us; but not by our own strength, \"for man is not mighty in strength.\" Therefore \"the Lord shall make His own adversary weak, the Lord is holy,\" that he may be conquered by the saints, whom the Lord, the Holy of holies, hath made saints. For this reason, \"let not the prudent glory in his prudence, and let not the mighty glory in his might, and let not the rich glory in his riches; but let him that glorieth glory in this,-to understand and know the Lord, and to do judgment and justice in the midst of the earth,\" He in no small measure understands and knows the Lord who understands and knows that even this, that he can understand and know the Lord, is given to him by the Lord. \"For what hast thou,\" saith the apostle, \"that thou hast not received? But if thou hast received it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?\"[fn-30-P3057_1694242:27-nf] That is, as if thou hadst of thine own self whereof thou mightest glory. Now, he does judgment and justice who lives aright. But he lives aright who yields obedience to God when He commands. \"The end of the commandment,\" that is, to which the commandment has reference, \"is charity out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned.\" Moreover, this \"charity,\" as the Apostle John testifies, \"is of God,\"[fn-30-P3058_1694679:28-nf] Therefore to do justice and judgment is of God. But what is \"in the midst of the earth?\" For ought those who dwell in the ends of the earth not to do judgment and justice? Who would say so? Why, then, is it added, \"In the midst of the earth?\" For if this had not been added, and it had only been said, \"To do judgment and justice,\" this commandment would rather have pertained to both kinds of men,-both those dwelling inland and those on the sea-coast. But lest any one should think that, after the end of the life led in this body, there remains. a time for doing judgment and justice which he has not done while he was in the flesh, and that the divine judgment can thus be escaped, \"in the midst of the earth\" appears to me to be said of the time when every one lives in the body; for in this life every one carries about his own earth, which, on a man's dying, the common earth takes back, to be surely returned to him on his rising again. Therefore \"in the midst of the earth,\" that is, while our soul is shut up in this earthly body, judgment and justice are to be done, which shall be profitable for us hereafter, when \"every one shall receive according to that he hath done in the body, whether good or bad.\"[fn-30-P3059_1695916:29-nf] For when the apostle there says \"in the body,\" he means in the time he has lived in the body. Yet if any one blaspheme with malicious mind and impious thought, without any member of his body being employed in it, he shall not therefore be guiltless because he has not done it with bodily motion, for he will have done it in that time which he has spent in the body. In the same way we may suitably understand what we read in the psalm, \"But God, our King before the worlds, hath wrought salvation in the midst of the earth;\"[fn-30-P3060_1696460:30-nf] so that the Lord Jesus may be understood to be our God who is before the worlds, because by Him the worlds were made, working our salvation in the midst of the earth, for the Word was made flesh and dwelt in an earthly body.","title":"Book XVII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_23_introductory_notice","source_chapter":123,"source_paragraph":"380","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"All the commandments of God, then, are embraced in love, of which the apostle says: \"Now the end of the commandment is charity, out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned.\"[fn-27-P2788_1287431:236-nf] Thus the end of every commandment is charity, that is, every commandment has love for its aim.

But if, even in the case of criminal and sordid loves, we see how those who desire to be loved in return make it their special and absorbing business, by such proofs as are within their power, to render the strength of the love which they themselves bear plain and patent; if we also perceive how they affect to put forward an appearance of justice in what they thus offer, such as may qualify them in some sort to demand that a response be made in all fairness to them on the part of those souls which they are laboring to beguile; if, further, their own passion burns more vehemently when they observe that the minds which they are eager to possess are also moved now by the same fire: if thus, I say, it happens at once that the soul which before was torpid is excited so soon as it feels itself to be loved, and that the soul which was enkindled already becomes the more inflamed so soon as it is made cognizant of the return of its own love, it is evident that no greater reason is to be found why love should be either originated or enlarged, than what appears in the occasion when one who as yet loves not at all comes to know himself to be the object of love, or when one who is already a lover either hopes that he may yet be loved in turn, or has by this time the evidence of a response to his affection. And if this holds good even in the case of base loves, how much more[fn-28-P2861_1312473:33-nf] in (true) friendship? For what else have we carefully to attend to in this question touching the injuring of friendship than to this, namely, not to give our friend cause to suppose either that we do not love him at all, or that we love him less than he loves us? If, indeed, he is led to entertain this belief, he will be cooler in that love in which men enjoy the interchange of intimacies one with another; and if he is not of that weak type of character to which such an offense to affection will serve as a cause of freezing off from love altogether, he yet confines himself to that kind of affection in which he loves, not with the view of enjoyment to himself, but with the idea of studying the good of others. But again it is worth our while to notice how,-although superiors also have the wish to be loved by their inferiors, and are gratified with the zealous attention[fn-28-P2862_1313510:34-nf] paid to them by such, and themselves cherish greater affection towards these inferiors the more they become cognizant of that,-with what might of love, nevertheless, the inferior kindles so soon as he learns that he is beloved by his superior. For there have we love in its more grateful aspect, where it does not consume itself[fn-28-P2863_1313976:35-nf] in the drought of want, but flows forth in the plenteousness of beneficence. For the former type of love is of misery, the latter of mercy.[fn-28-P2864_1314144:36-nf] And furthermore, if the inferior was despairing even of the possibility of his being loved by his superior, he will now be inexpressibly moved to love if the superior has of his own will condescended to show how much he loves this person who could by no means be bold enough to promise himself so great a good. But what is there superior to God in the character of Judge? and what more desperate than man in the character of sinner?-than man, I ask, who had given himself all the more unreservedly up to the wardship and domination of proudpowers which are unable to make him blessed, as he had come more absolutely to despair of the possibility of his being an object of interest to that power which wills not to be exalted in wickedness, but is exalted in goodness.","title":"Introductory Notice.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_27_book_xxi","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"120","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"But that these perversely compassionate persons may see what is the purport of these words, \"How great is the abundance of Thy sweetness, Lord, which Thou hast hidden for them that fear Thee.\"[fn-42-P4258_2326847:66-nf] let them read what follows:\" \"And Thou hast perfected it for them that hope in Thee.\" For what means, \"Thou hast hidden it for them that fear Thee, \"Thou hast perfected it for them that hope in Thee,\" unless this, that to those who through fear of punishment seek to establish their own righteousness by the law, the righteousness of God is not sweet, because they are ignorant of it?

With respect to the Holy Spirit, however, there has not been as yet, on the part of learned and distinguished investigators of the Scriptures, a discussion of the subject full enough or careful enough to make it possible for us to obtain an intelligent conception of what also constitutes His special individuality (proprium): in virtue of which special individuality it comes to be the case that we cannot call Him either the Son or the Father, but only the Holy Spirit; excepting that they predicate Him to be the Gift of God, so that we may believe God not to give a gift inferior to Himself. At the same time they hold by this position, namely, to predicate the Holy Spirit neither as begotten, like the Son, of the Father; for Christ is the only one [so begotten]: nor as [begotten] of the Son, like a Grandson of the Supreme Father: while they do not affirm Him to owe that which He is to no one, but [admit Him to owe it] to the Father, of whom are all things; lest we should establish two Beginnings without beginning (ne duo constituamus principia isne principio), which would be an assertion at once most false and most absurd, and one proper not to the catholic faith, but to the error of certain heretics.[fn-32-P3275_1506357:92-nf] Some, however, have gone so far as to believe that the communion of the Father and the Son, and (so to speak) their Godhead (deitatem), which the Greeks designate qeotha, is the Holy Spirit; so that, inasmuch as the Father is God and the Son God, the Godhead itself, in which they are united with each other,-to wit, the former by begetting the Son, and the latter by cleaving to the Father,[fn-32-P3276_1506799:93-nf] -should [thereby] be constituted equal with Him by whom He is begotten. This Godhead, then, which they wish to be understood likewise as the love and charity subsisting between these two [Persons], the one toward the other, they affirm to have received the name of the Holy Spirit. And this opinion of theirs they support by many proofs drawn from the Scriptures; among which we might instance either the passage which says, \"For the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, who has been given unto us,\"[fn-32-P3277_1507383:94-nf] or many other proofs texts of a similar tenor: while they ground their position also upon the express fact that it is through the Holy Spirit that we are reconciled unto God; whence also, when He is called the Gift of God, they will have it that sufficient indication is offered of the love of God and the Holy Spirit being identical. For we are not reconciled unto Him except through that love in virtue of which we are also called sons:[fn-32-P3278_1507839:95-nf] as we are no more \"under fear, like servants,\"[fn-32-P3279_1507954:96-nf] because \"love, when it is made perfect, casteth out fear;\"[fn-32-P3280_1508033:97-nf] and [as] \"we have received the spirit of liberty, wherein we cry, Abba, Father.\"[fn-32-P3281_1508134:98-nf] And inasmuch as, being reconciled and called back into friendship through love, we shall be able to become acquainted with all the secret things of God, for this reason it is said of the Holy Spirit that \"He shall lead you into all truth.\"[fn-32-P3282_1508394:99-nf] For the same reason also, that confidence in preaching the truth, with which the apostles were filled at His advent,[fn-32-P3283_1508531:100-nf] is rightly ascribed to love; because diffidence also is assigned to fear, which the perfecting of love excludes. Thus, likewise, the same is called the Gift of God,[fn-32-P3284_1508715:101-nf] because no one enjoys that which he knows, unless he also love it. To enjoy the Wisdom of God, however, implies nothing else than to cleave to the same in love (ei dilectione cohaerere). Neither does any one abide in that which he apprehends, but by love; and accordingly the Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of sanctity (Spiritus Sanctus), inasmuch as all things that are sanctioned (sanciuntur)[fn-32-P3285_1509135:102-nf] are sanctioned with a view to their permanence, and there is no doubt that the term sanctity (sanctitatem) is derived from sanction (a sanciendo). Above all, however, that testimony is employed by the upholders of this opinion, where it is thus written, \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit;\"[fn-32-P3286_1509634:103-nf] \"for God is a Spirit.\"[fn-32-P3287_1509677:104-nf] For here He speaks of our regeneration,[fn-32-P3288_1509737:105-nf] which is not, according to Adam, of the flesh, but, according to Christ, of the Holy Spirit. Wherefore, if in this passage mention is made of the Holy Spirit, when it is said, \"For God is a Spirit,\" they maintain that we must take note that it is not said, \"for the Spirit is God,\"[fn-32-P3289_1510223:106-nf] but, \"for God is a Spirit;\" so that the very Godhead of the Father and the Son is in this passage called God, and that is the Holy Spirit.

With respect to the Holy Spirit, however, there has not been as yet, on the part of learned and distinguished investigators of the Scriptures, a discussion of the subject full enough or careful enough to make it possible for us to obtain an intelligent conception of what also constitutes His special individuality (proprium): in virtue of which special individuality it comes to be the case that we cannot call Him either the Son or the Father, but only the Holy Spirit; excepting that they predicate Him to be the Gift of God, so that we may believe God not to give a gift inferior to Himself. At the same time they hold by this position, namely, to predicate the Holy Spirit neither as begotten, like the Son, of the Father; for Christ is the only one [so begotten]: nor as [begotten] of the Son, like a Grandson of the Supreme Father: while they do not affirm Him to owe that which He is to no one, but [admit Him to owe it] to the Father, of whom are all things; lest we should establish two Beginnings without beginning (ne duo constituamus principia isne principio), which would be an assertion at once most false and most absurd, and one proper not to the catholic faith, but to the error of certain heretics.[fn-32-P3275_1506357:92-nf] Some, however, have gone so far as to believe that the communion of the Father and the Son, and (so to speak) their Godhead (deitatem), which the Greeks designate qeotha, is the Holy Spirit; so that, inasmuch as the Father is God and the Son God, the Godhead itself, in which they are united with each other,-to wit, the former by begetting the Son, and the latter by cleaving to the Father,[fn-32-P3276_1506799:93-nf] -should [thereby] be constituted equal with Him by whom He is begotten. This Godhead, then, which they wish to be understood likewise as the love and charity subsisting between these two [Persons], the one toward the other, they affirm to have received the name of the Holy Spirit. And this opinion of theirs they support by many proofs drawn from the Scriptures; among which we might instance either the passage which says, \"For the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, who has been given unto us,\"[fn-32-P3277_1507383:94-nf] or many other proofs texts of a similar tenor: while they ground their position also upon the express fact that it is through the Holy Spirit that we are reconciled unto God; whence also, when He is called the Gift of God, they will have it that sufficient indication is offered of the love of God and the Holy Spirit being identical. For we are not reconciled unto Him except through that love in virtue of which we are also called sons:[fn-32-P3278_1507839:95-nf] as we are no more \"under fear, like servants,\"[fn-32-P3279_1507954:96-nf] because \"love, when it is made perfect, casteth out fear;\"[fn-32-P3280_1508033:97-nf] and [as] \"we have received the spirit of liberty, wherein we cry, Abba, Father.\"[fn-32-P3281_1508134:98-nf] And inasmuch as, being reconciled and called back into friendship through love, we shall be able to become acquainted with all the secret things of God, for this reason it is said of the Holy Spirit that \"He shall lead you into all truth.\"[fn-32-P3282_1508394:99-nf] For the same reason also, that confidence in preaching the truth, with which the apostles were filled at His advent,[fn-32-P3283_1508531:100-nf] is rightly ascribed to love; because diffidence also is assigned to fear, which the perfecting of love excludes. Thus, likewise, the same is called the Gift of God,[fn-32-P3284_1508715:101-nf] because no one enjoys that which he knows, unless he also love it. To enjoy the Wisdom of God, however, implies nothing else than to cleave to the same in love (ei dilectione cohaerere). Neither does any one abide in that which he apprehends, but by love; and accordingly the Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of sanctity (Spiritus Sanctus), inasmuch as all things that are sanctioned (sanciuntur)[fn-32-P3285_1509135:102-nf] are sanctioned with a view to their permanence, and there is no doubt that the term sanctity (sanctitatem) is derived from sanction (a sanciendo). Above all, however, that testimony is employed by the upholders of this opinion, where it is thus written, \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit;\"[fn-32-P3286_1509634:103-nf] \"for God is a Spirit.\"[fn-32-P3287_1509677:104-nf] For here He speaks of our regeneration,[fn-32-P3288_1509737:105-nf] which is not, according to Adam, of the flesh, but, according to Christ, of the Holy Spirit. Wherefore, if in this passage mention is made of the Holy Spirit, when it is said, \"For God is a Spirit,\" they maintain that we must take note that it is not said, \"for the Spirit is God,\"[fn-32-P3289_1510223:106-nf] but, \"for God is a Spirit;\" so that the very Godhead of the Father and the Son is in this passage called God, and that is the Holy Spirit. To this is added another testimony which the Apostle John offers, when he says, \"For God is love.\"[fn-32-P3290_1510571:107-nf] For here, in like manner, what he says is not, \"Love is God,\"[fn-32-P3291_1510655:108-nf] but, \"God is love;\" so that the very Godhead is taken to be love.

And if thou passest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned, and[fn-78-P7854_2631170:77-nf] the flame shall not burn thee; for I, the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, am He who maketh thee safe.\"[fn-78-P7855_2631343:78-nf] Who also promises in the Gospel that divine help shall not be wanting to God's servants in persecutions, saying: \"But when they shall deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak. For it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak. For it is not ye who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaketh in you.\"[fn-78-P7856_2631699:79-nf] And again: \"Settle it in your hearts not to meditate before how to answer.

Have not I, the Lord God? And now go, and I will open thy mouth, and will instruct thee what thou shall say.\"[fn-78-P7858_2632239:81-nf] Nor is it difficult for God to open the mouth of a man devoted to Himself, and to inspire constancy and confidence in speech to His confessor; since in the book of Numbers He made even a she-ass to speak against the prophet Balaam.[fn-78-P7859_2632492:82-nf] Wherefore in persecutions let no one think what danger the devil is bringing in, but let him indeed consider what help God affords; nor let human mischief overpower the mind, but let divine protection strengthen the faith; since every one, according to the Lord's promises and the deservings of his faith, receives so much from God's help as he thinks that he receives.

But the folly of the obliteration is clearly seen. For as the apostle declares that the Lord will come \"to take vengeance on them that know not God and that obey not the gospel, who,\" he says, \"shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power\"[fn-79-P7924_2257398:732-nf] -it follows that, as He comes to inflict punishment, He must require \"the flaming fire.\" Thus on this consideration too we must, notwithstanding Marcion's opposition, conclude that Christ belongs to a God who kindles the flames[fn-79-P7925_2257651:733-nf] (of vengeance), and therefore to the Creator, inasmuch as He takes vengeance on such as know not the Lord, that is, on the heathen. For he has mentioned separately \"those who obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ,\"[fn-79-P7926_2257896:734-nf] whether they be sinners among Christians or among Jews. Now, to inflict punishment on the heathen, who very likely have never heard of the Gospel, is not the function of that God who is naturally unknown, and who is revealed nowhere else than in the Gospel, and therefore cannot be known by all men.[fn-79-P7927_2258218:735-nf] The Creator, however, ought to be known even by (the light of) nature, for He may be understood from His works, and may thereby become the object of a more widely spread knowledge. To Him, therefore, does it appertain to punish such as know not God, for none ought to be ignorant of Him. In the (apostle's) phrase, \"From the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power,\"[fn-79-P7928_2258628:736-nf] he uses the words of Isaiah who for the express reason makes the self-same Lord \"arise to shake terribly the earth.\"[fn-79-P7929_2258767:737-nf] Well, but who is the man of sin, the son of perdition,\" who must first be revealed before the Lord comes; \"who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; who is to sit in the temple of God, and boast himself as being God? \"[fn-79-P7930_2259085:738-nf] According indeed to our view, he is Antichrist; as it is taught us in both the ancient and the new prophecies,[fn-79-P7931_2259222:739-nf] and especially by the Apostle John, who says that \"already many false prophets are gone out into the world,\" the fore-runners of Antichrist, who deny that Christ is come in the flesh,[fn-79-P7932_2259460:740-nf] and do not acknowledge[fn-79-P7933_2259506:741-nf] Jesus (to be the Christ), meaning in God the Creator. According, however, to Marcion's view, it is really hard to know whether He might not be (after all) the Creator's Christ; because according to him He is not yet come. But whichsoever of the two it is, I want to know why he comes \"in all power, and with lying signs and wonders? \"[fn-79-P7934_2260736:742-nf] \"Because,\" he says, \"they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved; for which cause God shall send them an instinct of delusion[fn-79-P7935_2260907:743-nf] (to believe a lie), that they all might be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.\"[fn-79-P7936_2261052:744-nf] If therefore he be Antichrist, (as we hold), and comes according to the Creator's purpose, it must be God the Creator who sends him to fasten in their error those who did not believe the truth, that they might be saved; His likewise must be the truth and the salvation, who avenges (the contempt of) them by sending error as their substitute[fn-79-P7937_2261421:745-nf] -that is, the Creator, to whom that very wrath is a fitting attribute, which deceives with a lie those who are not captivated with truth. If, however, he is not Antichrist, as we suppose (him to be) then He is the Christ of the Creator, as Marcion will have it. In this case how happens it that he[fn-79-P7938_2261744:746-nf] can suborn the Creator's Christ to avenge his truth? But should he after all agree with us, that Antichrist is here meant, I must then likewise ask how it is that he finds Satan, an angel of the Creator, necessary to his purpose? Why, too, should Antichrist be slain by Him, whilst commissioned by the Creator to execute the function[fn-79-P7939_2262255:747-nf] of inspiring men with their love of untruth? In short, it is incontestable that the emissary,[fn-79-P7940_2262379:748-nf] and the truth, and the salvation belong to Him to whom also appertain the wrath, and the jealousy,[fn-79-P7941_2262530:749-nf] and \"the sending of the strong delusion,\"[fn-79-P7942_2262590:750-nf] on those who despise and mock, as well as upon those who are ignorant of Him; and therefore even Marcion will now have to come down a step, and concede to us that his god is \"a jealous god.\" (This being then an unquestionable position, I ask) which God has the greater fight to be angry? He, as I suppose, who from the beginning of all things has given to man, as primary witnesses for the knowledge of Himself, nature in her (manifold) works, kindly providences, plagues,[fn-79-P7943_2263087:751-nf] and indications (of His divinity),[fn-79-P7944_2263198:752-nf] but who in spite of all this evidence has not been acknowledged; or he who has been brought out to view[fn-79-P7945_2263343:753-nf] once for all in one only copy of the gospel-and even that without any sure authority-which actually makes no secret of proclaiming another god?

Behold, then, I find both in the Gospels and in the (writings of the) apostles a visible and an invisible God (revealed to us), under a manifest and personal distinction in the condition of both. There is a certain emphatic saying by John: \"No man hath seen God at any time; \"[fn-105-P10594_2976311:172-nf] meaning, of course, at any previous time But he has indeed taken away all question of time, by saying that God had never been seen. The apostle confirms this statement; for, speaking of God, he says, \"Whom no man hath seen, nor can see; \"[fn-105-P10595_2976569:173-nf] because the man indeed would die who should see Him.[fn-105-P10596_2976644:174-nf] But the very same apostles testify that they had both seen and \"handled\" Christ.[fn-105-P10597_2976777:175-nf] Now, if Christ is Himself both the Father and the Son, how can He be both the Visible and the Invisible? In order, however, to reconcile this diversity between the Visible and the Invisible, will not some one on the other side argue that the two statements are quite correct: that He was visible indeed in the flesh, but was invisible before His appearance in the flesh; so that He who as the Father was invisible before the flesh, is the same as the Son who was visible in the flesh? If, however, He is the same who was invisible before the incarnation, how comes it that He was actually seen in ancient times before (coming in) the flesh? And by parity of reasoning, if He is the same who was visible after (coming in) the flesh, how happens it that He is now declared to be invisible by the apostles? How, I repeat, can all this be, unless it be that He is one, who anciently was visible only in mystery and enigma, and became more clearly visible by His incarnation, even the Word who was also made flesh; whilst He is another whom no man has seen at any time, being none else than the Father, even Him to whom the Word belongs? Let us, in short, examine who it is whom the apostles saw. \"That,\" says John, \"which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life.\"[fn-105-P10598_2978120:176-nf] Now the Word of life became flesh, and was heard, and was seen, and was handled, because He was flesh who, before He came in the flesh, was the \"Word in the beginning with God\" the Father,[fn-105-P10599_2978329:177-nf] and not the Father with the Word. For although the Word was God, yet was He with God, because He is God of God; and being joined to the Father, is with the Father.[fn-106-P10600_2978514:178-nf] \"And we have seen His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father; \"[fn-106-P10601_2978630:179-nf] that is, of course, (the glory) of the Son, even Him who was visible, and was glorified by the invisible Father. And therefore, inasmuch as he had said that the Word of God was God, in order that he might give no help to the presumption of the adversary, (which pretended) that he had seen the Father Himself and in order to draw a distinction between the invisible Father and the visible Son, he makes the additional assertion, ex abundanti as it were: \"No man hath seen God at any time.\"[fn-106-P10602_2979142:180-nf] What God does he mean? The Word? But he has already said: \"Him we have seen and heard, and our hands have handled the Word of life.\" Well, (I must again ask, ) what God does he mean? It is of course the Father, with whom was the Word, the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, and has Himself declared Him.[fn-106-P10603_2979484:181-nf] He was both heard and seen and, that He might not be supposed to be a phantom, was actually handled. Him, too, did Paul behold; but yet he saw not the Father. \"Have I not,\" he says, \"seen Jesus Christ our Lord? \"[fn-106-P10604_2979716:182-nf] Moreover, he expressly called Christ God, saying: \"Of whom are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever.\"[fn-106-P10605_2979902:183-nf] He shows us also that the Son of God, which is the Word of God, is visible, because He who became flesh was called Christ. Of the Father, however, he says to Timothy: \"Whom none among men hath seen, nor indeed can see; \"and he accumulates the description in still ampler terms: \"Who only hath immortality, and dwelleth in the light which no man can approach unto.\"[fn-106-P10606_2980285:184-nf] It was of Him, too, that he had said in a previous passage: \"Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to the only God; \"[fn-106-P10607_2980435:185-nf] so that we might apply even the contrary qualities to the Son Himself-mortality, accessibility-of whom the apostle testifies that \"He died according to the Scriptures,\"[fn-106-P10608_2980625:186-nf] and that \"He was seen by himself last of all,\"[fn-106-P10609_2980693:187-nf] -by means, of course, of the light which was accessible, although it was not without imperilling his sight that he experienced that light.[fn-106-P10610_2980847:188-nf] A like danger to which also befell Peter, and John, and James, (who confronted not the same light) without risking the loss of their reason and mind; and if they, who were unable to endure the glory of the Son,[fn-106-P10611_2981080:189-nf] had only seen the Father, they must have died then and there: \"For no man shall see God, and live.\"[fn-106-P10612_2981214:190-nf] This being the case, it is evident that He was always seen from the beginning, who became visible in the end; and that He, (on the contrary, ) was not seen in the end who had never been visible from the beginning; and that accordingly there are two-the Visible and the Invisible. It was the Son, therefore, who was always seen, and the Son who always conversed with men, and the Son who has always worked by the authority and will of the Father; because \"the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do\"[fn-106-P10613_2981760:191-nf] -\"do\" that is, in His mind and thought.[fn-106-P10614_2981819:192-nf] For the Father acts by mind and thought; whilst the Son, who is in the Father's mind and thought,[fn-106-P10615_2981934:193-nf] gives effect and form to what He sees. Thus all things were made by tile Son, and without Him was not anything made.[fn-106-P10616_2982167:194-nf] ","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":4,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":33,"source_paragraph":"98","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But, (this doctrine of yours bears a likeness) to the Jewish faith, of which this is the substance-so to believe in One God as to refuse to reckon the Son besides Him, and after the Son the Spirit.

And who was it that had begun to give him his love, however small, but He who prepares the will, and perfects by His co-operation what He initiates by His operation? Forasmuch as in beginning He works in us that we may have the will, and in perfecting works with us when we have the will.[fn-61-P6169_2385629:188-nf] On which account the apostle says, \"I am confident of this very thing, that He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.\"[fn-61-P6170_2385841:189-nf] He operates, therefore, without us, in order that we may will; but when we will, and so will that we may act, He co-operates with us. We can, however, ourselves do nothing to effect good works of piety without Him either working that we may will, or co-working when we will. Now, concerning His working that we may will, it is said: \"It is God which worketh in you, even to will.\"[fn-61-P6171_2386241:190-nf] While of His co-working with us, when we will and act by willing, the apostle says, \"We know that in all things there is co-working for good to them that love God.\"[fn-61-P6172_2386427:191-nf] What does this phrase, \"all things,\" mean, but the terrible and cruel sufferings which affect our condition?

Is, then, that depravity not to be rebuked in a man because it is not peculiar to him who is rebuked, but is common to all? Nay, let that also be rebuked in individuals, which is common to all. For the circumstance that none is altogether free from it is no reason why it should not attach to each man. Those original sins, indeed, are said to be the sins of others, because individuals derived them from their parents; but they are not unreasonably said to be our own also, because in that one, as the apostle says, all have sinned.[fn-63-P6381_2443533:34-nf] Let, then, the damnable source be rebuked, that from the mortification of rebuke may spring the will of regeneration,-if, indeed, he who is rebuked is a child of promise,-in order that, by the noise of the rebuke sounding and lashing from without, God may by His hidden inspiration work in him from within to will also. If, however, being already regenerate and justified, he relapses of his own will into an evil life, assuredly he cannot say, \"I have not received,\" because of his own free choice to evil he has lost the grace of God, that he had received. And if, stung with compunction by rebuke, he wholesomely bewails, and returns to similar good works, or even better, certainly here most manifestly appears the advantage of rebuke.

And when this has gained an entrance into a man's heart it produces contempt of all things, and begets a forgetfulness of kinsfolk and an horror of the world itself. But by the contempt for the loss of all possessions humility is gained. And humility is attested by these signs: First of all if a man has all his desires mortified; secondly, if he conceals none of his actions or even of his thoughts from his superior; thirdly, if he puts no trust in his own opinion, but all in the judgment of his superior, and listens eagerly and willingly to his directions; fourthly, if he maintains in everything obedience and gentleness and constant patience; fifthly, if he not only hurts nobody else, but also is not annoyed or vexed at wrongs done to himself; sixthly, if he does nothing and ventures on nothing to which he is not urged by the Common Rule or by the example of our elders; seventhly, if he is contented with the lowest possible position, and considers himself as a bad workman and unworthy inthe case of everything enjoined to him; eighthly, if he does not only outwardly profess with his lips that he is inferior to all, but really believes it in the inmost thoughts of his heart; ninthly, if he governs his tongue, and is not over talkative; tenthly, if he is not easily moved or too ready to laugh. For by such signs and the like is true humility recognised. And when this has once been genuinely secured, then at once it leads you on by a still higher step to love which knows no fear;[fn-24-P2415_1020241:55-nf] and through this you begin, without any effort andas it were naturally, to keep up everything that you formerly observed not without fearof punishment; no longer now from regard of punishment or fear of it but from love of goodness itself, and delight in virtue.[fn-24-P2416_1020528:56-nf] ","title":"Book IV.

A hard matter has he put to us, my brethren! It is well for us that he should tell us himself how we are to discern them. He is about to tell us: fear not: but first see; mark: see that hereby is expressed the very thing that vain heretics[fn-44-P4403_2379452:47-nf] taunt us withal. Mark, see what he says, \"Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits whether they be from God.\" The Holy Spirit is spoken of in the Gospel by the name of water; where the Lord \"cried and said, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. He that believeth on me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.\"[fn-44-P4404_2379821:48-nf] But the evangelist has expounded of what He said this: for he goes on to say, \"But this spake He of the Spirit, which they that believed on Him should receive.\" Wherefore did not the Lord baptize many? But what saith he? \"For the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.\" Then seeing those had baptism, and had not yet received the Holy Ghost, whom on the day of Pentecost the Lord sent from heaven, the glorifying of the Lord was first waited for, so that the Spirit might be given. Even before He was glorified, and before He sent the Spirit, He yet invited men to prepare themselves for the receiving of the water of which He said, \"Whoso thirsteth, let him come and drink;\" and, \"He that believeth on me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.\" What meaneth, \"Rivers of living water\"? What is that water? Let no man ask me; ask the Gospel. \"But this,\" saith it, \"He said of the Spirit, which they should receive that should believe on Him.\" Consequently, the water of the sacrament is one thing: another, the water which betokens the Spirit of God. The water of the sacrament is visible: the water of the Spirit invisible. That washes the body, and betokens that which is done in the soul. By this Spirit the soul itself is cleansed and fed. This is the Spirit of God, which heretics and all that cut themselves off from the Church, cannot have. And whosoever do not openly cut themselves off, but by iniquity are cut off, and being within, whirl about as chaff and are not grain; these have not this Spirit. This Spirit is denoted by the Lord under the name of water: and we have heard from this epistle, \"Believe not every spirit;\" and those words of Solomon bear witness, \"From strange water keep thee far.\"[fn-44-P4405_2381603:49-nf] What meaneth, \"water\"? Spirit. Does water always signify spirit? Not always: but in some places it signifies the Spirit, in some places it signifies baptism, in some places signifies peoples,[fn-44-P4406_2381819:50-nf] in some places signifies counsel: thus thou findest it said in a certain place, \"Counsel is a fountain of life to them that possess it.\"[fn-44-P4407_2381976:51-nf] So then, in divers places of the Scriptures, the term \"water\" signifies divers things. Now however by the term water ye have heard the Holy Spirit spoken of, not by an interpretation of ours but by witness of the Gospel, where it saith, \"But this said He of the Spirit, which they should receive that should believe on Him.\" If then by the name of water is signified the Holy Spirit, and this epistle saith to us, \"Believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they be of God;\" let us understand that of this it is said, \"From strange water keep thee far, and from a strange fountain drink thou not.\"[fn-44-P4408_2382608:52-nf] What meaneth, \"From a strange fountain drink thou not\"?

Hear the Gospel: \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\"[fn-44-P4471_2412333:31-nf] But let no man imagine God to himself according to the lust of his eyes. For so he makes unto himself either a huge form, or a certain incalculable magnitude which, like the light which he sees with the bodily eyes, he makes extend through all directions; field after field of space he gives it all the bigness he can; or, he represents to himself like as it were an old man of venerable form. None of these things do thou imagine. There is something thou mayest imagine, if thou wouldest see God; \"God is love.\" What sort of face hath love? what form hath it? what stature? what feet? what hands hath it? no man can say.

Or if one should wish to have it, he might think of stealing it from another's house. Charity is praised to you; if it please you, have it, possess it: no need that ye should rob any man, no need that ye should think of buying it; it is to be had freely, without cost.

All of which things the gospel saying, which uses this figure, shows us that we ought also to observe spiritually; first that whatever has found an entrance into our hearts, and whatever doctrine has been received by us, should be most carefully examined to see whether it has been purified by the divine and heavenly fire of the Holy Ghost, or whether it belongs to Jewish superstition, or whether it comes from the pride of a worldly philosophy and only externally makes a show of religion. And this we can do, if we carry out the Apostle's advice, \"Believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits whether they are of God.\"[fn-36-P3616_1344863:64-nf] But by this kind those men also are deceived, who after having been professed as monks are enticed by the grace of style, and certain doctrines of philosophers, which at the first blush, owing to some pious meanings not out of harmony with religion, deceive as with the glitter of gold their hearers, whom they have superficially attracted, but render them poor and miserable for ever, like men deceived by false money made of copper: either bringing them back to the bustle of this world, or enticing them into the errors of heretics, and bombastic conceits: a thing which we read of as happening to Achan in the book of Joshua the son of Nun,[fn-36-P3617_1345527:65-nf] when he coveted a golden weight from the camp of the Philistines, and stole it, and was smitten with a curse and condemned to eternal death. In the second place we should be careful to see that no wrong interpretation fixed on to the pure gold of Scripture deceives us as to the value of the metal: by which means the devil in his craft tried to impose upon our Lord and Saviour as if He was a mere man, when by his malevolent interpretation he perverted what ought to be understood generally of all good men, and tried to fasten it specially on to Him, who had no need of the care of the angels: saying, \"For He shall give His angels charge concerning Thee, to keep Thee in all Thy ways: and in their hands they shall bear Thee up, lest at any time Thou dash Thy foot against a stone,\"[fn-36-P3618_1346334:66-nf] by a skilful assumption on his part giving a turn to the precious sayings of Scripture and twisting them into a dangerous sense, the very opposite of their true meaning, so as to offer to us the image and face of an usurper under cover of the gold colour which may deceive us. Or whether he tries to cheat us with counterfeits, for instance by urging that some work of piety should be taken up which as it does come from the true minds of the fathers, leads under the form of virtue to vice; and, deceiving us either by immoderate or impossible fasts, or by too long vigils, or inordinate prayers, or unsuitable reading, brings us to a bad end. Or, when he persuades us to give ourselves up to mixing in the affairs of others, and to pious visits, by which he may drive us away from the spiritual cloisters of the monastery, and the secrecy of its friendly peacefulness, and suggests that we take on our shoulders the anxieties and cares of religious women who are in want, that when a monk is inextricably entangled in snares of this sort he may distract him with most injurious occupations and cares. Or else when he incites a man to desire the holy office of the clergy under the pretext of edifying many people, and the love of spiritual gain, by which to draw us away from the humility and strictness of our life. All of which things, although they are opposed to our salvation and to our profession, yet when covered with a sort of veil of compassion and religion, easily deceive those who are lacking in skill and care. For they imitate the coins of the true king, because they seem at first full of piety, but are not stamped by those who have the right to coin, i.e., the approved Catholic fathers, nor do they proceed from the head public office for receiving them, but are made by stealth and by the fraud of the devil, and palmed off upon the unskilful and ignorant not without serious harm. And even although they seem to be useful and needful at first, yet if afterwards they begin to interfere with the soundness of our profession, and as it were to weaken in some sense the whole body of our purpose, it is well that they should be cut off and cast away from us like a member which may be necessary, but yet offends us and which seems to perform the office of the right hand or foot. For it is better, without one member of a command, i.e., its working or result, to continue safe and sound in other parts, and to enter as weak into the kingdom of heaven rather than with the whole mass of commands to fall into some error which by an evil custom separates us from our strict rule and the system purposed and entered upon, and leads to such loss, that it will never outweigh the harm that will follow, but will cause all our past fruits and the whole body of our work to be burnt in hell fire.[fn-36-P3619_1349181:67-nf] Of which kind of illusions it is well said in the Proverbs: \"There are ways which seem to be right to a man, but their latter end will come into the depths of hell,\"[fn-36-P3620_1349375:68-nf] and again \"An evil man is harmful when he attaches himself to a good man,\"[fn-36-P3621_1349477:69-nf] i.e., the devil deceives when he is covered with an appearance of sanctity: \"but he hates the sound of the watchman,\"[fn-36-P3622_1349622:70-nf] i.e., the power of discretion which comes from the words and warnings of the fathers.","title":"I.

Ye remember, beloved, that of the epistles of John the apostle the last past remains to be handled by us and expounded to you, as the Lord vouchsafes. Of this debt then we are mindful: and ye ought to be mindful of your claim. For indeed this same charity, which in this epistle is chiefly and almost alone commended, at once maketh us most faithful in paying our debts, and you most sweet in exacting your rights. I have said, most sweet in exacting, because where charity is not, he that exacts is bitter: but where charity is, both he that exacts is sweet, and he of whom it is exacted, although he undertakes some labor, yet charity makes the very labor to be almost no labor, and light. Do we not see how, even in dumb and irrational animals, where the love is not spiritual but carnal and natural, with great affection the mother yields herself to her young ones when they will have the milk which is their right: and however impetuously the suckling rushes at the teats, yet that is better for the mother than that it should not suck nor exact that which of love is due? Often we see great calves driving their heads at the cow's udders with a force that almost lifts up the mother's body, yet does she not kick them off; nay, if the young one be not there to suck, the towing of the dam calls for it to come to the teats. If then there be in us that spiritual charity of which the apostle saith, \"I became small in the midst of you even as a nurse cherishing her young ones;\"[fn-45-P4558_2459615:1-nf] we love you the more when ye are exacting. We like not the sluggish, because for the languid ones we are afraid. We have been obliged, however, to intermit the continuous reading of this epistle, because of certain stated lessons coming between, which must needs be read on their holy days, and the same preached upon. Let us now come back to the order which was interrupted; and what remains, holy brethren, receive ye with all attention. I know not whether charity could be more magnificently commended to us, than that it should be said, \"Charity is God.\"[fn-45-P4559_2460193:2-nf] Brief praise, yet mighty praise: brief in utterance, mighty in meaning! How soon is it said, \"Love is God!\" This also is short: if thou count it, it is one: if thouweigh it, how great is it! \"Love is God, and he that dwelleth,\" saith he, \"in love, dwelleth in God, and God dwelleth in him.\" Let God be thy house, and be thou an house of God; dwell in God, and let God dwell in thee. God dwelleth in thee, that He may hold thee: thou dwellest in God, that thou mayest not fall; for thus saith the apostle of this same charity \"Charity never falleth.\"[fn-45-P4560_2460762:3-nf] How should He fall whom God holdeth?","title":"Homily IX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_140_homily_ix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"2. \"Herein is our love made perfect in us that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as He is, so are we in this world.\"[fn-45-P4562_2460967:4-nf] He tells how each may prove himself, what progress charity has made in him or rather what progress he has made in charity. For if charity is God, God is capable neither of proficiency nor of deficiency: that charity is said to be making proficiency in thee, means only that thou makest proficiency in it. Ask therefore what proficiency thou hast made in charity, and what thine heart will answer thee, that thou mayest know the measure of thy profiting. For he has promised to show us in what we may know Him, and hath said, \"In this is love made perfectin us.\" Ask, in what? \"That we have boldness in the day of judgment.\" Whoso hath boldness in the day of judgment, in that man is charity made perfect. What is it to have boldness in the day of judgment? Not to fear lest the day of judgment should come. There are men who do not believe in a day of judgment; these cannot have boldness in a day which they do not believe will come. Let us pass these: may God awaken them, that they may live; why speak we of the dead? They do not believe that there will be a day of judgment; they neither fear nordesire what they do not believe. Some man has begun to believe in a day of judgment: if he has begun to believe, he has also begun to fear. But because he fears as yet, because he hath not yet boldness in the day of judgment, not yet is charity in that man made perfect. But for all that, is one to despair? In whom thou seest the beginning, why despairest thou of the end? What beginning do I see? (sayest thou.) That very fear. Hear the Scripture: \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\"[fn-45-P4563_2462586:5-nf] Well then, he has begun to fear the day of judgment: by fearing let him correct himself, let him watch against his enemies, i.e. his sins; let him begin to come to life again inwardly, and to mortify his members which are upon the earth, as the apostle saith, \"Mortify your members which are upon the earth.\"[fn-45-P4564_2462918:6-nf] By the members upon earth he means spiritual wickedness:[fn-45-P4565_2462991:7-nf] for he goes on to expound it, \"Covetousness, uncleanness,\"[fn-45-P4566_2463076:8-nf] and the rest which he there follows out. Now in proportion as this man who has begun to fear the day of judgment, mortifies his members which are upon the earth, in that proportion the heavenly members rise up and are strengthened. But the heavenly members are all good works. As the heavenly members rise up, he begins to desire that which once he feared. Once he feared lest Christ should come and find in him the impious whom He must condemn; now he longs for Him to come, because He shall find the pious man whom He may crown. Having now begun to desire Christ's coming, the chaste soul which desires the embrace of the Bridegroom renounces the adulterer, becomes a virgin within by faith, hope, and charity. Now hath the man boldness in the day of judgment: he fights not against himself when he prays, \"Thy kingdom come.\"[fn-45-P4567_2463920:9-nf] For he that fears test the kingdom of God should come, fears lest his prayer be heard. How can he be said to pray, who fears lest his prayer be heard? But he that prays with boldness of charity, wishes now that He may come. Of this same desire said one in the Psalm, \"And thou, Lord, how long? Turn, Lord, and deliver my soul.\"[fn-45-P4568_2464266:10-nf] He groaned at being so put off. For there are men who with patience submit to die; but there are some perfect who with patience endure to live. What do I mean? When a person still desires this life, that person, when the day of death comes, patiently endures death: he struggles against himself that he may follow the will of God, and in his mind desires that which God chooseth, not what man's will chooseth: from desire of the present life there comes a reluctance against death, but yet he takes to him patience and fortitude, that he may with an even mind meet death; he dies patiently. But when a man desires, as the apostle saith, \"to be dissolved and to be with Christ,\"[fn-45-P4569_2464963:11-nf] that person, not patiently dies, but patiently lives, delightedly dies. See the apostle patiently living, i.e. how with patience he here, not loves life, but endures it. \"To be dissolved,\" saith be, \"and to be with Christ, is far better: but to continue in the flesh is necessary for your sakes.\" Therefore, brethren, do your endeavor, settle it inwardly with yourselves to make this your concern, that ye may desire the day of judgment. No otherwise is charity proved to be perfect, but only when one has begun to desire that day. But that man desires it, who hath boldness in it, whose conscience feels no alarm in perfect and sincere charity.","title":"Homily IX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_140_homily_ix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"4. Now therefore concerning this same boldness, let us see what he says. Whence do we understand that charity is perfect? \"There is no fear in charity.\"[fn-45-P4573_2467647:13-nf] Then what say we of him that has begun to fear the day of judgment? If charity in him were perfect, he would not fear. For perfect charity would make perfect righteousness, and he would have nothing to fear: nay rather he would have something to desire; that iniquity may pass away, and God's kingdom come. So then, \"there is no fear in charity.\" But in what charity? Not in charity begun: in whatthen? \"But perfect charity,\" saith he, \"casteth out fear.\" Then let fear make the beginning, because \"the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\" Fear, so to say, prepares a place for charity. But when once charity has begun to inhabit, the fear which prepared the place for it is cast out. For in proportion as this increases, that decreases: and the more this comes to be within, is the fear cast out. Greater charity, less fear; less charity, greater fear. But if no fear, there is no way for charity to come in. As we see in sewing, the thread is introduced by means of the bristle;[fn-45-P4574_2468657:14-nf] the bristle first enters, but except it come out the thread does not come into its place: so fear first occupies the mind, but the fear does not remain there, because it enters only in order to introduce charity. When once there is the sense of security in the mind, what joy have we both in this world and in the world to come! Even in this world, who shall hurt us, being full of charity? See how the apostle exults concerning this very charity: \"Who shall separate us from the charity of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?\"[fn-45-P4575_2469266:15-nf] And Peter saith: \"And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers[fn-45-P4576_2469357:16-nf] of that which is good?-There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment.\"[fn-45-P4577_2469502:17-nf] The consciousness of sins torments the heart: justification has not yet taken place.

Fear doth goad: but fear not thou: charity enters in, and she heals the wound that fear inflicts. The fear of God so wounds as doth the leech's knife;[fn-45-P4579_2470206:19-nf] it takes away the rottenness, and seems to make the wound greater. Behold, when the rottenness was in the body, the wound was less, but perilous: then comes the knife; the wound smarted less than it smarts now while the leech is cutting it. It smarts more while he is operating upon it than it would if it were not operated upon; it smarts more under the healing operation, but only that it may never smart when the healing is effected. Then let fear occupy thine heart, that it may bring in charity; let the cicatrice succeed to the leech's knife. He is such an Healer, that the cicatrices do not even appear: only do thou put thyself under His hand. For if thou be without fear, thou canst not be justified.

By loving we became friends: but He loved us as enemies, that we might be made friends. He first loved us, and gave us the gift of loving Him. We did not yet love Him: by loving we are made beautiful. If a man deformed and ill-featured love a beautiful woman, what shall he do? Or what shall a woman do, if, being deformed and ill-featured and black-complexioned, she love a beautiful man? By loving can she become beautiful? Can he by loving become handsome? He loves a beautiful woman, and when he sees himself in a mirror, he is ashamed to lift up his face to her his lovely one of whom he is enamored. What shall he do that he may be beautiful? Does he wait for good looks to come? Nay rather, by waiting old age is added to him, and makes him uglier. There is nothing then to do, there is no way to advise him, but only that he should restrain himself, and not presume to love unequally: or if perchance he does love her, and wishes to take her to wife, in her let him love chastity, not the face of flesh. But our soul, my brethren, is unlovely by reason of iniquity: by loving God it becomes lovely. What a love must that be that makes the lover beautiful! But God is always lovely, never unlovely, never changeable. Who is always lovely first loved us; and what were we when He loved us but foul and unlovely? But not to leave us foul; no, but to change us, and of unlovely make us lovely. How shall we become lovely? By loving Him who is always lovely. As the love increases in thee, so the loveliness increases: for love is itself the beauty of the soul. \"Let us love, because He first loved us.\" Hear the apostle Paul: \"But God showed His love in us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us:\"[fn-45-P4599_2482839:34-nf] the just for the unjust, the beautiful for the foul. How find we Jesus beautiful? \"Thou art beauteous in loveliness surpassing the sons of men; grace is poured upon thy lips.\"[fn-46-P4600_2483034:35-nf] Why so? Again see why it is that He is fair; \"Beauteous in loveliness surpassing the sons of men:\" because \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\"[fn-46-P4601_2483240:36-nf] But in that He took flesh, He took upon Him, as it were, thy foulness, i.e. thy mortality, that He might adapt Himself to thee, and become suited to thee, and stir thee up to the love of the beauteousness within. Where then in Scripture do we find Jesus uncomely and deformed, as we have found Him comely and \"beauteous in loveliness surpassing the sons of men?\" where find we Him also deformed? Ask Esaias: \"And we saw Him, and He had no form nor comeliness.\"[fn-46-P4602_2483717:37-nf] There now are two flutes which seem to make discordant sounds: howbeit one Spirit breathes into both. By this it is said, \"Beauteous in loveliness surpassing the sons of men:\" by that it is said in Esaias, \"We saw Him, and He had no form nor comeliness.\" By one Spirit are both flutes filled, they make no dissonance. Turn not away thine ears, apply the understanding. Let us ask the apostle Paul, and let him expound to us the unison of the two flutes, Let him sound to us the note, \"Beauteous in loveliness surpassing the sons of men.-Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God.\"[fn-46-P4603_2484349:38-nf] Let him sound to us also the note, \"We saw Him, and He had no form nor comeliness.-He made Himself of no reputation, taking upon Him the form of a servant, made in the likeness of men, and in fashion found as man. He had no form nor comeliness,\" that He might give thee form and comeliness. What form? what comeliness? The love which is in charity:[fn-46-P4604_2484719:39-nf] that loving, thou mayest run;[fn-46-P4605_2484778:40-nf] running, mayest love.

Be thou fair only to the end He may love thee.

What is the way by which we run? Christ hath told us, \"I am the Way.\"[fn-46-P4625_2491965:4-nf] What the home to which we run? \"I am the Truth.\" By Him thou runnest, to Him thou runnest, in Him thou restest. But, that we might run by Him, He reached even unto us: for we were afar off, foreigners in a far country. Not enough that we were in a far country, we were feeble also that we could not stir. A Physician, He came to the sick: a Way, He extended Himself to them that were in a far country. Let us be saved by Him, let us walk in Him. This it is to \"believe that Jesus is the Christ,\" as Christians believe, who are not Christians only in name, but in deeds and in life, not as the devils believe. For \"the devils also believe and tremble,\"[fn-46-P4626_2492633:5-nf] as the Scripture tells us. What more could the devils believe, than that they should say, \"We know who thou art, the Son of God?\"[fn-46-P4627_2492780:6-nf] What the devils said, the same said Peter also. When the Lord asked them who He was, and whom did men say that He was, the disciples made answer to Him, \"Some say that thou art John the Baptist; some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God.\"[fn-46-P4628_2493190:7-nf] And this he heard from the Lord: \"Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona; for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.\" See what praises follow this faith. \"Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church.\" What meaneth, \"Upon this rock I will build my Church\"? Upon this faith; upon this that has been said, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God. Upon this rock,\" saith He, \"I will build my Church.\" Mighty praise! So then, Peter saith, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God:\" the devils also say, \"We know who thou art, the Son of God, the Holy One of God.\" This Peter said, this also the devils: the words the same, the mind not the same. And how is it clear that Peter said this with love? Because a Christian's faith is with love, but a devil's without love. How without love? Peter said this, that he might embrace Christ; the devils said it, that Christ might depart from them. For before they said, \"We know who thou art, the Son of God, they said, \"What have we to do with thee? Why art thou come to destroy us before the time?\" It is one thing then to confess Christ that thou mayest hold Christ, another thing to confess Christ that thou mayest drive Christ from thee. So then ye see, that in the sense in which he here saith, \"Whoso believeth,\" it is a faith of one's own, not as one has a faith in common with many. Therefore, brethren, let none of the heretics say to you, \"We also believe.\" For to this end have I given you an instance from the case of devils, that ye may not rejoice in the words of believing, but search well the deeds of the life.","title":"Homily X.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_141_homily_x_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"3. \"In this we know that we love the sons of God.\"[fn-46-P4632_2496260:9-nf] What is this, brethren? Just now he was speaking of the Son of God, not of sons of God: lo, here one Christ was set before us to contemplate, and we were told, \"Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth Him that begat,\" i, e. the Father, \"loveth Him also that is begotten of Him,\" i.e. the Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. And he goes on: \"In this we know that we love the sons of God;\" as if he bad been about to say, \"In this we know that we love the Son of God.\" He has said, \"the sons of God,\" whereas he was speaking just before of the Son of God-because the sons of God are the Body of the Only Son of God, and when He is the Head, we the members, it is one Son of God. Therefore, he that loves the sons of God, loves the Son of God, and he that loves the Son of God, loves the Father; nor can any love the Father except he love the Son, and he that loves the sons, loves also the Son of God. What sons of God? The members of the Son of God. And by loving he becomes himself a member, and comes through love to be in the frame of the body of Christ, so there shall be one Christ, loving Himself. For when the members love one another, the body loves itself. \"And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honored, all the members rejoice with it.\"[fn-46-P4633_2497604:10-nf] And then he goes on to say, \"Now ye are the body of Christ, and members.\" John was speaking just before of brotherly love, and said, \"He that loveth not his brother whom he seeth, how can he love God whom he seeth not?\"[fn-46-P4634_2497849:11-nf] But if thou lovest thy brother, haply thou lovest thy brother and lovest not Christ? How should that be, when thou lovest members of Christ? When therefore thou lovest members of Christ, thou lovest Christ; when thou lovest Christ, thou lovest the Son of God; when thou lovest the Son of God, thou lovest also the Father. The love therefore cannot be separated into parts. Choose what thou wilt love; the rest follow thee. Suppose thou say, I love God alone, God the Father. Thou liest: if thou lovest, thou lovest Him not alone; but if thou lovest the Father, thou lovest also the Son. Behold, sayest thou, I love the Father, and I love the Son: but this only, the Father God and the Son God, our Lord Jesus Christ, who ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father, that Word by which all things were made, and \"the Word was made flesh, and dwelt in us:\" this alone I love. Thou liest; for if thou lovest the Head, thou lovest also the members; but if thou lovest not the members, neither lovest thou the Head. Dost thou not quake at the voice uttered by the Head from Heaven on behalf of His members, \"Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou ME?\"[fn-46-P4635_2499032:12-nf] The persecutor of His members He called His persecutor: His lover, the lover of His members. Now what are His members, ye know, brethren: none other than the Church of God. \"In this we know that we love the sons of God, in that we love God.\" And how? Are not the sons of God one thing, God Himself another? But he that loves God, loves His precepts. And what are the precepts of God? \"A new commandment give I unto you, that ye love one another.\"[fn-46-P4636_2499496:13-nf] Let none excuse himself by another love, for another love; so and so only is it with this love: as the love itself is compacted in one, so all that hang by it doth it make one, and as fire melts them down into one. It is gold: the lump is molten and becomes some one thing. But unless the fervor of charity be applied, of many there can be no melting down into one. \"That we love God,\" by this \"know we that we love the sons of God.\"","title":"Homily X.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_141_homily_x_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"7. \"For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments.\"[fn-46-P4660_2509192:33-nf] Already ye have heard, \"On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\" See how He would not have thee divide thyself over a multitude of pages: \"On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\" On what two commandments? \"Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.

Therefore hold fast love, and set your minds at rest. Why fearest thou lest thou do evil to some man? Who does evil to the man he loves? Love[fn-46-P4662_2509890:35-nf] thou: it is impossible to do this without doing good. But it may be, thou rebukest? Kindness[fn-46-P4663_2509996:36-nf] does it, not fierceness.

And indeed there come somehow these different and contrary results, that sometimes hatred uses winning ways, and charity shows itself fierce. A person hates his enemy, and feigns friendship for him: he sees him doing some evil, he praises him: he wishes him to go headlong, wishes him to go blind over the precipice of his lusts, haply never to return; he praises him, \"For the sinner is praised in the desires of his soul;\"[fn-46-P4665_2510618:38-nf] he applies to him the unction of adulation; behold, he hates, and praises. Another sees his friend doing something of the same sort; he calls him back; if he will not hear, he uses words even of castigation, he scolds, he quarrels:[fn-46-P4666_2510865:39-nf] there are times when it comes to this, that one must even quarrel! Behold, hatred shows itself winningly gentle, and charity quarrels! Stay not thy regard upon the words of seeming kindness, or the seeming cruelty of the rebuke; look into the vein[fn-46-P4667_2511127:40-nf] they come from; seek the root whence they proceed. The one is gentle and bland that he may deceive, the other quarrels that he may correct. Well then, it is not for us, brethren, to enlarge your heart: obtain from God the gift to love one another. Love all men, even your enemies, not because they are your brethren, but that they may be your brethren; that ye may be at all times on fire with brotherly love, whether toward him that is become thy brother, or towards thine enemy, so that, by being beloved, he may become thy brother. Wheresoever ye love a brother, ye love a friend. Now is he with thee, now is he knit to thee in unity, yea catholic unity. If thou art living aright, thou lovest a brother made out of an enemy. But thou lovest some man who has not yet believed Christ, or, if he have believed, believes as do the devils: thou rebukest his vanity. Do thou love, and that with a brotherly love: he is not yet a brother, but thou lovest to the end he may be a brother. Well then, all our love is a brotherly love, towards Christians, towards all His members.

Wherefore we are \"to bless those who persecute us.

Wherefore also to those capable of perceiving he showed resurrection, that of the life still in the flesh, creeping on its belly. Whence also he applied the name \"brood of vipers\" to the voluptuous, who serve the belly and the pudenda, and cut off one another's heads for the sake of worldly pleasures. \"Little children, let us not love in word, or in tongue,\" says John, teaching them to be perfect, \"but in deed and in truth; hereby shall we know that we are of the truth.\"[fn-68-P6884_2109502:143-nf] And if \"God be love,\" piety also is love: \"there is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear.\"[fn-68-P6885_2109634:144-nf] \"This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments.\"[fn-68-P6886_2109718:145-nf] And again, to him who desires to become a Gnostic, it is written, \"But be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in love, in faith, in purity.\"[fn-68-P6887_2109903:146-nf] For perfection in faith differs, I think, from ordinary faith. And the divine apostle furnishes the rule for the Gnostic in these words, writing as follows: \"For I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, to be content. I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to lack. I can do all things through Him who strengtheneth me.\"[fn-68-P6888_2110362:147-nf] And also when discussing with others in order to put them, to shame, he does not shrink from saying, \"But call to mind the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions; partly, whilst ye were made a gazing-stock, both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used. For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took with joy the spoiling of your goods, knowing that you have a better and enduring substance. Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after doing the will of God, ye may obtain the promise. For yet a little while, and He that cometh will come, and will not tarry. Now the just shall live by faith: and if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are not of them that draw back unto perdition, but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.\"[fn-68-P6889_2111342:148-nf] He then brings forward a swarm of divine examples. For was it not \"by faith,\" he says, this endurance, that they acted nobly who \"had trial of mockeries and scourgings, and, moreover, of bonds and imprisonments? They were stoned, they were tempted, were slain with the sword. They wandered about in sheep-skins and goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts, in mountains, in dens, and caves of the earth. And all having received a good report, through faith, received not the promise of God\" (what is expressed by a parasiopesis is left to be understood, viz., \"alone \"). He adds accordingly, \"God having provided some better thing for us (for He was good), that they should not without us be made perfect. Wherefore also, having encompassing us such a cloud,\" holy and transparent, \"of witnesses, laying aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, let us run with patience the race set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.\"[fn-68-P6890_2112408:149-nf] Since, then, he specifies one salvation in Christ of the righteous,[fn-68-P6891_2112510:150-nf] and of us he has expressed the former unambiguously, and saying nothing less respecting Moses, adds, \"Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he had respect to the recompense of the reward. By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured as seeing Him who is invisible.\"[fn-68-P6892_2112908:151-nf] The divine Wisdom says of the martyrs, \"They seemed in the eyes of the foolish to die, and their departure was reckoned a calamity, and their migration from us an affliction. But they are in peace. For though in the sight of men they were punished, their hope was full of immortality.\"[fn-68-P6893_2113261:152-nf] He then adds, teaching martyrdom to be a glorious purification, \"And being chastened a little, they shall be benefited much; because God proved them,\" that is, suffered them to be tried, to put them to the proof, and to put to shame the author of their trial, \"and found them worthy of Himself,\" plainly to be called sons. \"As gold in the furnace He proved them, and as a whole burned-offering of sacrifice He accepted them.

I will then return to my father and will say unto him, `Father I have sinned against heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.'\"[fn-51-P5150_1861256:14-nf] But those words of humble penitence his father who ran to meet him received with greater affection than that with which they were spoken, and was not content to allow him lesser things, but passing through the two stages without delay restored him to his former dignity of sonship. We also ought forthwith to hasten on that by means of the indissoluble grace of love we may mount to that third stage of sonship, which believes that all that the father has is its own, and so we may be counted worthy to receive the image and likeness of our heavenly Father, and be able to say after the likeness of the true son: \"All that the Father hath is mine.\"[fn-51-P5151_1861929:15-nf] Which also the blessed Apostle declares of us, saying: \"All things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours.\"[fn-51-P5152_1862151:16-nf] And to this likeness the commands of our Saviour also summon us: \"Be ye,\" says He, \"perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect\"[fn-51-P5153_1862307:17-nf] For in these persons sometimes the love of goodness is found to be interrupted, when the vigour of the soul is relaxed by some coldness or joy or delight, and so loses either the fear of hell for the time, or the desire of future blessings. And there is indeed in these a stage leading to some advance, which affects us so that when from fear of punishment or from hope of reward we begin to avoid sin we are enabled to pass on to the stage of love, for \"fear,\" says one, \"is not in love, but perfect love casteth out fear: for fear hath torment, but he who fears is not perfect in love. We therefore love because God first loved us.\"[fn-51-P5154_1862964:18-nf] We can then only ascend to that true perfection when, as He first loved us for the grace of nothing but our salvation, we also have loved Him for the sake of nothing but His own love alone. Wherefore we must do our best to mount with perfect ardour of mind from this fear to hope, from hope to the love of God, and the love of the virtues themselves, that as we steadily pass on to the love of goodness itself, we may, as far as it is possible for human nature, keep firm hold of what is good.","title":"XI.

Of which fear and love the Lord in chiding some shows what is befitting for each one: \"A son knoweth his own father, and a servant feareth his lord: And if I be a Father, where is My honour: and if I be a Lord, where is my fear?\"[fn-51-P5163_1867256:19-nf] For one who is a servant must needs fear because \"if knowing his lord's will he has done things worthy of stripes, he shall be beaten with many stripes.\"[fn-51-P5164_1867426:20-nf] Whoever then by this love has attained the image and likeness of God, will now delight in goodness for the pleasure of goodness itself, and having somehow a like feeling of patience and gentleness will henceforth be angered by no faults of sinners, but in his compassion and sympathy will rather ask for pardon for their infirmities, and, remembering that for so long he himself was tried by the stings of similar passions till by the Lord's mercy he was saved, will feel that, as he was saved from carnal attacks not by the teaching of his own exertions but by God's protection, not anger but pity ought to be shown to those who go astray; and with full peace of mind will he sing to God the following verse: \"Thou hast broken my chains. I will offer to Thee the sacrifice of praise;\" and: \"except the Lord had helped me, my soul had almost dwelt in hell.\"[fn-51-P5165_1868307:21-nf] And while he continues in this humility of mind he will be able even to fulfil this Evangelic command of perfection: \"Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that persecute you and slander you.\"[fn-51-P5166_1868584:22-nf] And so it will be vouchsafed to us to attain that reward which is subjoined, whereby we shall not only bear the image and likeness of God, but shall even be called sons: \"that ye may be,\" says He \"sons of your Father which is in heaven, Who maketh His sun to rise on the good and evil, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust:\"[fn-51-P5167_1868938:23-nf] and this feeling the blessed John knew that he had attained when he said: \"that we may have confidence in the day of judgment, because as He is so are we also in this world.\"[fn-51-P5168_1869126:24-nf] For in what can a weak and fragile human nature be like Him, except in always showing a calm love in its heart towards the good and evil, the just and the unjust, in imitation of God, and by doing good for the love of goodness itself, arriving at that true adoption of the sons of God, of which also the blessed Apostle speaks as follows: \"Every one that is born of God doeth not sin, for His seed is in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God;\" and again: \"We know that every one who is born of God sinneth not, but his birth of God preserves him, and the wicked one toucheth him not?\"[fn-51-P5169_1869743:25-nf] And this must be understood not of all kinds of sins, but only of mortal sins: and if any one will not extricate and cleanse himself from these, for him the aforesaid Apostle tells us in another place that we ought not even to pray, saying: \"If a man knows his brother to be sinning a sin not unto death, let him ask, and He will give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he should ask for it.\"[fn-51-P5170_1870216:26-nf] But of those which he says are not unto death, from which even those who serve Christ faithfully cannot, with whatever care they keep themselves, be free, of these he says: \"If we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us;\" and again: \"If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.\"[fn-51-P5171_1870583:27-nf] For it is an impossibility for any one of the saints not to fall into those trivial faults which are committed by word, and thought, and ignorance, and forgetfulness, and necessity, and will, and surprise: which though quite different from that sin which is said to be unto death, still cannot be free from fault and blame.","title":"XI.

For no uniform crown of perfection can be offered to all men, because all have not the same virtue, or purpose, or fervour, and so the Divine Word has in some way appointed different ranks and different measures of perfection itself. And that this is so the variety of beatitudes in the gospel clearly shows. For though they are called blessed, whose is the kingdom of heaven, and blessed are they who shall possess the earth, and blessed are they who shall receive their consolation, and blessed are they who shall be filled, yet we believe that there is a great difference between the habitations of the kingdom of heaven, and the possession of the earth, whatever it be, and also between the reception of consolation and the fulness and satisfaction of righteousness; and that there is a great distinction between those who shall obtain mercy, and those who shall be deemed worthy to enjoy the most glorious vision of God. \"For there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for star differeth from star in glory, so also is the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-51-P5193_1875211:36-nf] While therefore in accordance with this rule holy Scripture praises those who fear God, and says \"Blessed are all they that fear the Lord,\"[fn-51-P5194_1875375:37-nf] and promises them for this a full measure of bliss, yet it says again: \"There is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear: for fear hath torment. But he that feareth is not yet perfect in love.\"[fn-51-P5195_1875611:38-nf] And again, though it is a grand thing to serve God, and it is said: \"Serve the Lord in fear;\" and: \"It is a great thing for thee to be called My servant;\" and: \"Blessed is that servant whom his Lord, when He cometh, shall find so doing,\"[fn-51-P5196_1875869:39-nf] yet it is said to the Apostles: \"I no longer call you servants, for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth: but I call you friends, for all things whatsoever I have heard from my Father, I have made known unto you.\"[fn-51-P5197_1876139:40-nf] And once more: \"Ye are My friends, if ye do whatever I command you.\"[fn-51-P5198_1876233:41-nf] You see then that there are different stages of perfection, and that we are called by the Lord from high things to still higher in such a way that he who has become blessed and perfect in the fear of God; going as it is written \"from strength to strength,\"[fn-51-P5199_1876511:42-nf] and from one perfection to another, i.e., mounting with keenness of soul from fear to hope, is summoned in the end to that still more blessed stage, which, is love, and he who has been \"a faithful and wise servant\"[fn-52-P5200_1876757:43-nf] will pass to the companionship of friendship and to the adoption of sons. So then our saying also must be understood according to this meaning: not that we say that the consideration of that enduring punishment or of that blessed recompense which is promised to the saints is of no value, but because, though they are useful and introduce those who pursue them to the first beginning of blessedness, yet again love, wherein is already fuller confidence, and a lasting joy, will remove them from servile fear and mercenary hope to the love of God, and carry them on to the adoption of sons, and somehow make them from being perfect still more perfect. For the Saviour says that in His Father's house are \"many mansions,\"[fn-52-P5201_1877501:44-nf] and although all the stars seem to be in the sky, yet there is a mighty difference between the brightness of the sun and of the moon, and between that of the morning star and the rest of the stars. And therefore the blessed Apostle prefers it not only above fear and hope but also above all gifts which are counted great and wonderful, and shows the way of love still more excellent than all. For when after finishing his list of spiritual gifts of virtues he wanted to describe its members, he began as follows: \"And yet I show unto you a still more excellent way. Though I speak with the tongues of men and angels, and though I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith so that I can remove mountains, and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profiteth me nothing.\" You see then that nothing more precious, nothing more perfect, nothing more sublime, and, if I may say so, nothing more enduring can be found than love. For \"whether there be prophecies, they shall fail, whether there be tongues, they shall cease, whether there be knowledge, it shall be destroyed,\" but \"love never faileth,\"[fn-52-P5202_1878734:45-nf] and without it not only those most excellent kinds of gifts, but even the glory of martyrdom itself will fail.","title":"XI.

And one of the prophets has finely described the grandeur of this fear, saying: \"Wisdom and knowledge are the riches of salvation: the fear of the Lord is his treasure.\"[fn-52-P5207_1879765:46-nf] He could not describe with greater clearness the worth and value of that fear than by saying that the riches of our salvation, which consist in true wisdom and knowledge of God, can only be preserved by the fear of the Lord.

For it was clearly of that other penal fear that the Apostle John said that \"He who feareth is not made perfect in love, for fear hath punishment.\"[fn-52-P5209_1880466:48-nf] There is then a great difference between this fear, to which nothing is lacking, which is the treasure of wisdom and knowledge, and that imperfect fear which is called \"the beginning of wisdom,\"[fn-52-P5210_1880681:49-nf] and which has in it punishment and so is expelled from the hearts of those who are perfect by the incoming of the fulness of love. For \"there is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear.\"[fn-52-P5211_1880903:50-nf] And in truth if the beginning of wisdom consists in fear, what will its perfection be except in the love Of Christ which, as it contains in it the fear which belongs to perfect love, is called not the beginning but the treasure of wisdom and knowledge? And therefore there is a twofold stage of fear. The one for beginners, i.e., for those who are still subject to the yoke and to servile terror; of which we read: \"And the servant shall fear his Lord;\"[fn-52-P5212_1881377:51-nf] and in the gospel: \"I no longer call you servants, for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth;\" and therefore \"the servant,\" He tells us, \"abideth not in the house for ever, but the Son abideth for ever.\"[fn-52-P5213_1881610:52-nf] For He is instructing us to pass on from that penal fear to the fullest freedom of love, and the confidence of the friends and sons of God. Finally the blessed Apostle, who had by the power of the Lord's love already passed through the servile stage of fear, scorns lower things and declares that he has been enriched with good things by the Lord, \"for God hath not given us\" he says \"a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind.\"[fn-52-P5214_1882090:53-nf] Those also who are inflamed with a perfect love of their heavenly Father, and whom the Divine adoption has already made sons instead of servants, he addresses in these words: \"For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.\"[fn-52-P5215_1882417:54-nf] It is of this fear too, that the prophet spoke when he would describe that sevenfold spirit, which according to the mystery of the Incarnation, full surely descended on the God man:[fn-52-P5216_1882619:55-nf] \"And there shall rest upon Him the Spirit of the Lord: the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the Spirit of counsel and of might, the Spirit of knowledge and of true godliness,\" and in the last place he adds as something special these words: \"And the Spirit of the fear of the Lord shall fill Him.\"[fn-52-P5217_1882984:56-nf] Where we must in the first place notice carefully that he does not say \"and there shall rest upon Him the Spirit of fear,\" as he said in the earlier cases, but he says \"there shall fill Him the Spirit of the fear of the Lord.\" For such is the greatness of its richness that when once it has seized on a man by its power, it takes possession not of a portion but of his whole mind. And not without good reason. For as it is closely joined to that love which \"never faileth,\" it not only fills the man, but takes a lasting and inseparable and continual possession of him in whom it has begun, and is not lessened by any allurements of temporal joy or delights, as is sometimes the case with that fear which is cast out. This then is the fear belonging to perfection, with which we are told that the God-man,[fn-52-P5218_1883810:57-nf] who came not only to redeem mankind, but also to give us a pattern of perfection and example of goodness, was filled. For the true Son of God \"who did no sin neither was guile found in His mouth,\"[fn-52-P5219_1884028:58-nf] could not feel that servile fear of punishment.","title":"XI.

Finally the blessed Apostle, who had by the power of the Lord's love already passed through the servile stage of fear, scorns lower things and declares that he has been enriched with good things by the Lord, \"for God hath not given us\" he says \"a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind.\"[fn-52-P5214_1882090:53-nf] Those also who are inflamed with a perfect love of their heavenly Father, and whom the Divine adoption has already made sons instead of servants, he addresses in these words: \"For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.\"[fn-52-P5215_1882417:54-nf] It is of this fear too, that the prophet spoke when he would describe that sevenfold spirit, which according to the mystery of the Incarnation, full surely descended on the God man:[fn-52-P5216_1882619:55-nf] \"And there shall rest upon Him the Spirit of the Lord: the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the Spirit of counsel and of might, the Spirit of knowledge and of true godliness,\" and in the last place he adds as something special these words: \"And the Spirit of the fear of the Lord shall fill Him.\"[fn-52-P5217_1882984:56-nf] Where we must in the first place notice carefully that he does not say \"and there shall rest upon Him the Spirit of fear,\" as he said in the earlier cases, but he says \"there shall fill Him the Spirit of the fear of the Lord.\" For such is the greatness of its richness that when once it has seized on a man by its power, it takes possession not of a portion but of his whole mind. And not without good reason. For as it is closely joined to that love which \"never faileth,\" it not only fills the man, but takes a lasting and inseparable and continual possession of him in whom it has begun, and is not lessened by any allurements of temporal joy or delights, as is sometimes the case with that fear which is cast out. This then is the fear belonging to perfection, with which we are told that the God-man,[fn-52-P5218_1883810:57-nf] who came not only to redeem mankind, but also to give us a pattern of perfection and example of goodness, was filled. For the true Son of God \"who did no sin neither was guile found in His mouth,\"[fn-52-P5219_1884028:58-nf] could not feel that servile fear of punishment.","title":"XI.

I gladly rejoice and am thankful, most brave and blessed brethren, at hearing of your faith and virtue, wherein the Church, our Mother, glories. Lately, indeed, she gloried, when, in consequence of an enduring confession, that punishment was undergone which drove the confessors of Christ into exile; yet the present confession is so much the more illustrious and greater in honour as it is braver in suffering. The combat has increased, and the glory of the combatants has increased also. Nor were you kept back from the struggle by fear of tortures, but by the very tortures themselves you were more and more stimulated to the conflict; bravely and firmly you have returned with ready devotion, to contend in the extremest contest. Of you I find that some are already crowned, while some are even now within reach of the crown of victory; but all whom the danger has shut up in a glorious company are animated to carry on the struggle with an equal and common warmth of virtue, as it behoves the soldiers of Christ in the divine camp: that no allurements may deceive the incorruptible stedfastness of your faith, no threats terrify you, no sufferings or tortures overcome you, because \"greater is He that is in us, than he that is in the world; \"[fn-49-P4900_1484451:2-nf] nor is the earthly punishment able to do more towards casting down, than is the divine protection towards lifting up. This truth is proved by the glorious struggle of the brethren, who, having become leaders to the rest in overcoming their tortures, afforded an example of virtue and faith, contending in the strife, until the strife yielded, being overcome. With what praises can I commend you, most courageous brethren? With what vocal proclamation can I extol the strength of your heart and the perseverance of your faith? You have borne the sharpest examination by torture, even unto the glorious consummation, and have not yielded to sufferings, but rather the sufferings have given way to you. The end of torments, which the tortures themselves did not give, the crown has given. The examination by torture waxing severer, continued for a long time to this result, not to overthrow the stedfast faith, but to send the men of God more quickly to the Lord. The multitude of those who were present saw with admiration the heavenly contest,-the contest of God, the spiritual contest, the battle of Christ,-saw that His servants stood with free voice, with unyielding mind, with divine virtue-bare, indeed, of weapons of this world, but believing and armed with the weapons of faith. The tortured stood more brave than the torturers; and the limbs, beaten and torn as they were, overcame the hooks that bent and tore them. The scourge, often repeated with all its rage, could not conquer invincible faith, even although the membrane which enclosed the entrails were broken, and it was no longer the limbs but the wounds of the servants of God that were tortured. Blood was flowing which might quench the blaze of persecution, which might subdue the flames of Gehenna with its glorious gore.[fn-49-P4901_1486260:3-nf] Oh, what a spectacle was that to the Lord,-how sublime, how great, how acceptable to the eyes of God in the allegiance and devotion of His soldiers! As it is written in the Psalms, when the Holy Spirit at once speaks to us and warns us: \"Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.\"[fn-49-P4902_1486804:4-nf] Precious is the death which has bought immortality at the cost of its blood, which has received the crown from the consummation of its virtues. How did Christ rejoice therein! How willingly did He both fight and conquer in such servants of His, as the protector of their faith, and giving to believers as much as he who taketh believes that he receives! He was present at His own contest; He lifted up, strengthened, animated the champions and assertors of His name. And He who once conquered death on our behalf, always conquers it in us. \"When they,\" says He, \"deliver you up, take no thought what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak. For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.\"[fn-49-P4903_1487580:5-nf] The present struggle has afforded a proof of this saying. A voice filled with the Holy Spirit broke forth from the martyr's mouth when the most blessed Mappalicus said to the proconsul in the midst of his torments, \"You shall see a contest to-morrow.\" And that which he said with the testimony of virtue and faith, the Lord fulfilled. A heavenly contest was exhibited, and the servant of God was crowned ill the struggle of the promised fight. This is the contest which the prophet Isaiah of old predicted, saying, \"It shall be no light contest for you with men, since God appoints the struggle.\"[fn-49-P4904_1488197:6-nf] And in order to show what this struggle would be, he added the words, \"Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and ye shall call His name Emmanuel.\"[fn-49-P4905_1488390:7-nf] This is the struggle of our faith in which we engage, in which we conquer, in which we are crowned. This is the struggle which the blessed Apostle Paul has shown to us, in which it behoves us to run and to attain the crown of glory. \"Do ye not know,\" says he, \"that they which run in a race, run all indeed, but one receiveth the prize? So run that ye may obtain.\" \"Now they do it that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.\"[fn-49-P4906_1488857:8-nf] Moreover, setting forth his own struggle, and declaring that he himself should soon be a sacrifice for the Lord's sake, he says, \"I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my assumption is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto all them also that love His appearing.\"[fn-49-P4907_1489354:9-nf] This fight, therefore, predicted of old by the prophets, begun by the Lord, waged by the apostles, Mappalicus promised again to the proconsul in his own name and that of his colleagues. Nor did the faithful voice deceive in his promise; he exhibited the fight to which he had pledged himself, and he received the reward which he deserved. I not only beseech but exhort the rest of you, that you all should follow that martyr now most blessed, and the other partners of that engagement,-soldiers and comrades, stedfast in faith, patient in suffering, victors in tortures,-that those who are united at once by the bond of confession, and the entertainment of a dungeon, may also be united in the consummation of their virtue and a celestial crown; that you by your joy may dry the tears of our Mother, the Church, who mourns over the wreck and death of very many; and that you may confirm, by the provocation of your example, the stedfastness of others who stand also. If the battle shall call you out, if the day of your contest shall come engage bravely, fight with constancy, as knowing that you are fighting under the eyes of a present Lord, that you are attaining by the confession of His name to His own glory; who is not such a one as that He only looks on His servants, but He Himself also wrestles in us, Himself is engaged,-Himself also in the struggles of our conflict not only crowns, but is crowned. But if before the day of your contest, of the mercy of God, peace shall supervene, let there still remain to you the sound will and the glorious conscience.[fn-49-P4908_1490942:10-nf] Nor let any one of you be saddened as if he were inferior to those who before you have suffered tortures, have overcome the world and trodden it under foot, and so have come to the Lord by a glorious road. For the Lord is the \"searcher out of the reins and the hearts.\"[fn-49-P4909_1491389:11-nf] He looks through secret things, and beholds that which is concealed. In order to merit the crown from Him, His own testimony alone is sufficient, who will judge us. Therefore, beloved brethren, either case is equally lofty and illustrious,-the former more secure, to wit, to hasten to the Lord with the consummation of our victory,-the latter more joyous; a leave of absence, after glory, being received to flourish in the praises of the Church. O blessed Church of ours, which the honour of the divine condescension illuminates, Which in our own times the glorious blood of martyrs renders illustrious! She was white before in the works of the brethren; now she has become purple in the blood of the martyrs. Among her flowers are wanting neither roses nor lilies. Now let each one strive for the largest dignity of either honour. Let them receive crowns, either white, as of labours, or of purple, as of suffering. In the heavenly camp both peace and strife have their own flowers, with which the soldier of Christ may be crowned for glory. I bid you, most brave and beloved brethren, always heartily farewell in the Lord; and have me in remembrance.Fare ye well.","title":"Epistle VIII.","author":"Cyprian"},{"chapter":4,"verse":18,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_86_who_is_the_rich_man_that_shall_be_saved_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"55","folder":"ANF-02","text":"XXXVIII.

But if He is also called `First-born of the creation[fn-62-P6296_2510263:409-nf] ,' still this is not as if He were levelled to the creatures, and only first of them in point of time (for how should that be, since He is `Only-begotten?'), but it is because of the Word's condescension[fn-62-P6297_2510714:410-nf] to the creatures, according to which He has become the `Brother' of `many.' For the term `Only-begotten' is used where there are no brethren, but `First-born[fn-62-P6298_2511565:411-nf] ' because of brethren. Accordingly it is nowhere written in the Scriptures, `the first-born of God,' nor `the creature of God;' but `Only-begotten' and `Son' and `Word' and `Wisdom,' refer to Him as proper to the Father[fn-62-P6299_2511812:412-nf] . Thus, `We have seen His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father[fn-63-P6300_2512365:413-nf] ;' and `God sent His Only-begotten Son[fn-63-P6301_2512423:414-nf] ;' and `O Lord, Thy Word endureth for ever[fn-63-P6302_2512487:415-nf] ;' and `In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God;' and `Christ the Power of God and the Wisdom of God[fn-63-P6303_2512625:416-nf] ;' and `This is My beloved Son;' and `Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God[fn-63-P6304_2512731:417-nf] .' But `first-born' implied the descent to the creation[fn-63-P6305_2512824:418-nf] ; for of it has He been called first-born; and `He created' implies His grace towards the works, for for them is He created. If then He is Only-begotten, as indeed He is, `First-born' needs some explanation; but if He be really First-born, then He is not Only-begotten[fn-63-P6306_2513246:419-nf] . For the same cannot be both Only-begotten and First-born, except in different relations;-that is, Only-begotten, because of His generation from the Father, as has been said; and First-born, because of His condescension to the creation and His making the many His brethren. Certainly, those two terms being inconsistent with each other, one should say that the attribute of being Only-begotten has justly the preference in the instance of the Word, in that there is no other Word, or other Wisdom, but He alone is very Son of the Father. Moreover[fn-63-P6307_2513947:420-nf] , as was before[fn-63-P6308_2514371:421-nf] said, not in connection with any reason, but absolutely[fn-63-P6309_2514441:422-nf] it is said of Him, `The Only-begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father[fn-63-P6310_2514651:423-nf] ;' but the word `First-born' has again the creation as a reason in connection with it, which Paul proceeds to say, `for in Him all things were created[fn-63-P6311_2514821:424-nf] .'

We then, by way of giving a rude view of the expressions in this passage, have been led into many words, but blessed John will shew from his Epistle the sense of the words, concisely and much more perfectly than we can. And he will both disprove the interpretation of these irreligious men, and will teach how we become in God and God in us; and bow again we become One in Him, and how far the Son differs in nature from us, and will stop the Arians from any longer thinking that they shall be as the Son, lest they hear it said to them, `Thou art a man and not God,' and `Stretch not thyself, being poor, beside a rich man[fn-67-P6705_2660877:181-nf] .' John then thus writes; `Hereby know we that we dwell in Him and He in us, because He hath given us of His Spirit[fn-67-P6706_2661036:182-nf] .' Therefore because of the grace of the Spirit which has been given to us, in Him we come to be, and He in us[fn-67-P6707_2661169:183-nf] ; and since it is the Spirit of God, therefore through His becoming in us, reasonably are we, as having the Spirit, considered to be in God, and thus is God in us. Not then as the Son in the Father, so also we become in the Father; for the Son does not merely partake the Spirit, that therefore He too may be in the Father; nor does He receive the Spirit, but rather He supplies It Himself to all; and the Spirit does not unite the Word to the Father[fn-67-P6708_2661642:184-nf] , but rather the Spirit receives from the Word. And the Son is in the Father, as His own Word and Radiance; but we, apart from the Spirit, are strange and distant from God, and by the participation of the Spirit we are knit into the Godhead; so that our being in the Father is not ours, but is the Spirit's which is in us and abides in us, while by the true confession we preserve it in us, John again saying, `Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him and he in Gods[fn-67-P6709_2662311:185-nf] .'

If those rejoiced whose bodily eyes were opened by the Lord, what joy was his who saw with the eyes of his soul the light ineffable, the abiding Word, the brilliance that dazzles the minds of the pious, the unfailing Wisdom, God abiding with the Father, and at some time come in the flesh and yet not to withdraw from the bosom of the Father? All this did Abraham see. For in saying \"my day,\" it may be uncertain of what He spake; whether the day of the Lord in time, when He should come the flesh, or that day of the Lord which knows not a dawn, and knows no decline. But for my part I doubt not that father Abraham knew it all. And where shall I find it out? Ought the testimony of our Lord Jesus Christ to satisfy us?

For it was a great matter that was in hand when marriage was sought for Abraham's seed.

Fools find fault with Abraham because he said, Put thy hand under my thigh. Those who find fault with Christ's flesh find fault with Abraham's conduct. But let us, brethren, if we acknowledge the flesh of Christ as worthy of veneration, despise not that thigh, but receive it as spoken of prophetically. For a prophet also was Abraham. Whose prophet? Of his own seed, and of his Lord.

The Lord, in exhorting His servants to endure with patience the hatred of the world, proposes to them no greater and better example than His own; seeing that, as the Apostle Peter says, \"Christ suffered for us, leaving us an example, that we should follow His steps.\"[fn-30-P3018_1708560:1-nf] And if we really do so, we do it by His assistance, who said, \"Without me ye can do nothing.\" But further, to those to whom He had already said, \"If the world hate you, know that it hated me before it hated] you,\" He now also says in the word you have just been hearing, when the Gospel was read, \"Remember my word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord: if they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.\" Now in saying, \"The servant is not greater than his lord,\" does He not clearly indicate how He would have us understand what He had said above, \"Henceforth I call you not servants\"?[fn-30-P3019_1709253:2-nf] For, you see, He calleth them servants. For what else can the words imply, \"The servant is not greater than his lord: if they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you\"? It is clear, therefore, that when it is said, \"Henceforth I call you not servants,\" He is to be understood as speaking of that servant[fn-30-P3020_1709592:3-nf] who abideth not in the house for ever,[fn-30-P3021_1709667:4-nf] but is characterized by the fear which love casteth out;[fn-30-P3022_1709743:5-nf] whereas, when it is here said, \"The servant is not greater than his lord: if they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you,\" that servant is meant who is distinguished by the clean fear which endureth for ever.[fn-30-P3023_1709980:6-nf] For this is the servant who is yet to hear, \"Well done, thou good servant: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\"[fn-30-P3024_1710108:7-nf] ","title":"Tractate LXXXVIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_97_tractate_xcii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"2. \"And ye also,\" He says,\" shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.\" The Holy Spirit shall bear witness, and so also shall ye. For, just because ye have been with me from the beginning, they can preach what ye know; which ye cannot do at present, because the fullness of that Spirit is not yet present within you. \"He therefore shall testify of me, and ye also shall bear witness:\" for the love of God shed abroad in your hearts by the Holy Spirit, who shall be given unto you,[fn-31-P3100_1742672:3-nf] will give you the confidence needful for such witness-bearing. And that certainly was still wanting to Peter, when, terrified by the question of a lady's maid, he could give no true testimony; but, contrary to his own promise, was driven by the greatness of his fear thrice to deny Him.[fn-31-P3101_1742973:4-nf] But there is no such fear in love, for perfect love casteth out fear.[fn-31-P3102_1743065:5-nf] In fine, before the Lord's passion, his slavish fear was questioned by a bond-woman; but after the Lord's resurrection, his free love by the very Lord of freedom:[fn-31-P3103_1743246:6-nf] and so on the one occasion he was troubled, on the other tranquillized; there he denied the One he had loved, here he loved the One he had denied. But still even then that very love was weak and straitened, till strengthened and expanded by the Holy Spirit. And then that Spirit, pervading him thus with the fullness of richer grace, kindled his hitherto frigid heart to such a witness-bearing for Christ, and unlocked those lips that in their previous tremor had suppressed the truth, that, when all on whom the Holy Spirit had descended were speaking in the tongues of all nations to the crowds of Jews collected around, he alone broke forth before the others in the promptitude of his testimony in behalf of the Christ, and con-rounded His murderers with the account of His resurrection. And if any one would enjoy the pleasure of gazing on a sight so charming in its holiness, let him read the Acts of the Apostles:[fn-31-P3104_1744183:7-nf] and there let him be filled with amazement at the preaching of the blessed Peter, over whose denial of his Master he had just been mourning; there let him behold that tongue, itself translated from diffidence to confidence, from bondage to liberty, converting to the confession of Christ the tongues of so many of His enemies, riot one of which he could bear when lapsing himself into denial. And what shall I say more? In him there shone forth such an effulgence of grace, and such a fullness of the Holy Spirit, and such a weight of most precious truth poured from the lips of the preacher, that he transformed that vast multitude of Jews who were the adversaries and murderers of Christ into men that were ready to die for His name, at whose hands he himself was formerly afraid to die with his Master. All this did that Holy Spirit when sent, who had previously only been promised. And it was these great and marvellous gifts of His own that the Lord foresaw, when He said, \"They have both seen and hated both me and my Father: that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause. But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, who proceedeth from the Father, He shall testify of me: and ye also shall bear witness.\" For He, in bearing witness Himself, and inspiring such witnesses with invincible courage, divested Christ's friends of their fear, and transformed into love the hatred of His enemies.","title":"Tractate XCII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_97_epistle_lxxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"ANF-05","text":"15.
