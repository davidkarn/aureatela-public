{"verses":["My little children, these things I write to you, that you may not\nsin.  But if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus\nChrist the just.","And he is the propitiation for our sins:  and not for ours only,\nbut also for those of the whole world.","And by this we know that we have known him, if we keep his\ncommandments.","He who saith that he knoweth him and keepeth not his commandments\nis a liar:  and the truth is not in him.","But he that keepeth his word, in him in very deed the charity of\nGod is perfected.  And by this we know that we are in him.","He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as\nhe walked.","Dearly beloved, I write not a new commandment to you, but an old\ncommandment which you had from the beginning.  The old commandment is\nthe word which you have heard.","Again a new commandment I write unto you:  which thing is true both\nin him and in you, because the darkness is passed and the true light\nnow shineth.","He that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is in\ndarkness even until now.","He that loveth his brother abideth in the light:  and there is no\nscandal in him.","But he that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in\ndarkness and knoweth not whither he goeth:  because the darkness hath\nblinded his eyes.","I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven\nyou for his name's sake.","I write unto you, fathers, because you have known him who is from\nthe beginning.  I write unto you, young men, because you have overcome\nthe wicked one.","I write unto you, babes, because you have known the Father.  I\nwrite unto you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God\nabideth in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.","Love not the world, nor the things which are in the world.  If any\nman love the world, the charity of the Father is not in him.","For all that is in the world is the concupiscence of the flesh\nand the concupiscence of the eyes and the pride of life, which is not\nof the Father but is of the world.","And the world passeth away and the concupiscence thereof:  but he\nthat doth the will of God abideth for ever.","Little children, it is the last hour:  and as you have heard that\nAntichrist cometh, even now there are become many Antichrists:  whereby\nwe know that it is the last hour.","They went out from us but they were not of us.  For if they had\nbeen of us, they would no doubt have remained with us:  but that they\nmay be manifest, that they are not all of us.","But you have the unction from the Holy One and know all things.","I have not written to you as to them that know not the truth, but\nas to them that know it:  and that no lie is of the truth.","Who is a liar, but he who denieth that Jesus is the Christ?  This\nis Antichrist, who denieth the Father and the Son.","Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father.  He that\nconfesseth the Son hath the Father also.","As for you, let that which you have heard from the beginning\nabide in you.  If that abide in you, which you have heard from the\nbeginning, you also shall abide in the Son and in the Father.","And this is the promise which he hath promised us, life\neverlasting.","These things have I written to you concerning them that seduce\nyou.","And as for you, let the unction, which you have received from him\nabide in you.  And you have no need that any man teach you:  but as his\nunction teacheth you of all things and is truth and is no lie.  And as\nit hath taught you, abide in him.","And now, little children, abide in him, that when he shall appear\nwe may have confidence and not be confounded by him at his coming.","If you know that he is just, know ye, that every one also who\ndoth justice is born of him."]}
