The book begins thus: \"Vanity of the vain, saith the Preacher, vanity of the vain; all is vanity. What profit hath a man of all his labor which he taketh under the sun?\"[fn-4-P447_197932:62-nf] If all these words are considered, weighed, and thoroughly examined, many things are found of essential importance to those who seek to flee from the world and to take shelter in God; but this requires time and our discourse hastens on to other topics. But, after this beginning, he goes on to show in detail that the vain[fn-4-P448_198277:63-nf] are those who are deceived by things of this sort; and he calls this which deceives them vanity,-not that God did not create those things, but because men choose to subject themselves by their sins to those things, which the divine law has made subject to them in well-doing. For when you consider things beneath yourself to be admirable and desirable, what is this but to be cheated and misled by unreal goods? The man, then, who is temperate in such mortal and transient things has his rule of life confirmed by both Testaments, that he should love none of these things, nor think them desirable for their own sakes, but should use them as far as is required for the purposes and duties of life, with the moderation of an employer instead of the ardor of a lover These remarks on temperance are few in proportion to the greatness of the theme, but perhaps too many in view of the task on hand.","title":"Of the Morals of the Catholic Church.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"268","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"6.

What brings you, a solitary, into the throng of men? The advice that I give is that of no inexperienced mariner who has never lost either ship or cargo, and has never known a gale. Lately shipwrecked as I have been myself, my warnings to other voyagers spring from my own fears. On one side, like Charybdis, self-indulgence sucks into its vortex the soul's salvation. On the other, like Scylla, lust, with a smile on her girl's face, lures it on to wreck its chastity. The coast is savage, and the devil with a crew of pirates carries irons to fetter his captives. Be not credulous, be not over-confident.The sea may be as smooth and smiling as a pond, its quiet surface may be scarcely ruffled by a breath of air, yet sometimes its waves are as high as mountains. There is danger in its depths, the foe is lurking there. Ease your sheets, spread your sails, fasten the cross as an ensign on your prow. The calm that you speak of is itself a tempest. \"Why so?\" you will perhaps argue; \"are not all my fellow-townsmen Christians?\" Your case, I reply, is not that of others. Listen to the words of the Lord: \"If thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and come and follow me.\"[fn-4-P414_76063:208-nf] You have already promised to be perfect. For when you forsook the army and made yourself an eunuch for the kingdom of heaven's sake,[fn-4-P415_76218:209-nf] you did so that you might follow the perfect life. Now the perfect servant of Christ has nothing beside Christ. Or if he have anything beside Christ he is not perfect. And if he be not perfect when he has promised God to be so, his profession is a lie. But \"the mouth that lieth slayeth the soul.\"[fn-4-P416_76538:210-nf] To conclude, then, if you are perfect you will not set your heart on your father's goods; and if you are not perfect you have deceived the Lord.

We are told, for instance, that lamentation was made for Moses; yet when the funeral of Joshua is described[fn-12-P1241_266494:836-nf] no mention at all is made of weeping. The reason, of course, is that under Moses-that is under the old Law-all men were bound by the sentence passed on Adam's sin, and when they descended into hell[fn-12-P1242_266715:837-nf] were rightly accompanied with tears. For, as the apostle says, \"death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned.\"[fn-12-P1243_266898:838-nf] But under Jesus,[fn-12-P1244_266934:839-nf] that is, under the Gospel of Christ, who has unlocked for us the gate of paradise, death is accompanied, not with sorrow, but with joy. The Jews go on weeping to this day; they make bare their feet, they crouch in sackcloth, they roll in ashes. And to make their superstition complete, they follow a foolish custom of the Pharisees, and eat lentils,[fn-12-P1245_267341:840-nf] to show, it would seem, for what poor fare they have lost their birthright.[fn-12-P1246_267571:841-nf] Of course they are right to weep, for as they do not believe in the Lord's resurrection they are being made ready for the advent of antichrist. But we who have put on Christ[fn-12-P1247_267766:842-nf] and according to the apostle are a royal and priestly race,[fn-12-P1248_267847:843-nf] we ought not to grieve for the dead. \"Moses,\" the Scripture tells us, \"said unto Aaron and unto Eleazar, and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left: Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people.\"[fn-12-P1249_268122:844-nf] Rend not your clothes, he says, neither mourn as pagans, lest you die. For, for us sin is death. In this same book, Leviticus, there is a provision which may perhaps strike some as cruel, yet is necessary to faith: the high priest is forbidden to approach the dead bodies of his father and mother, of his brothers and of his children;[fn-12-P1250_268487:845-nf] to the end, that no grief may distract a soul engaged in offering sacrifice to God, and wholly devoted to the Divine mysteries. Are we not taught the same lesson in theGospel in other words? Is not the disciple forbidden to say farewell to his home or to bury his dead father?[fn-12-P1251_268788:846-nf] Of the high priest, again, it is said: \"He shall not go out of the sanctuary, and the sanctification of his God shall not be contaminated, for the anointing oil of his God is upon him.\"[fn-12-P1252_268997:847-nf] Certainly, now that we have believed in Christ, and bear Him within us, by reason of the oil of His anointing which we have received,[fn-12-P1253_269158:848-nf] we ought not to depart from His temple-that is, from our Christian profession-we ought not to go forth to mingle with the unbelieving Gentiles, but always to remain within, as servants obedient to the will of the Lord.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"650","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"The leaders will rise as one man against my epistle; the mob of patricians will thunder at me.

I am aware that a talebearer-a class of persons who do a great deal of harm-once told her as a kindness that owing to her great fervour in virtue some people thought her mad and declared that something should be done for her head.

Down to the very day of her death two things were conspicuous in her life, one her great patience and the other the jealousy which was manifested towards her.

Cyprian to Magnus his son, greeting. With your usual religious diligence, you have consulted my poor intelligence, dearest son, as to whether, among other heretics, they also who come from Novatian ought, after his profane washing, to be baptized, and sanctified in the Catholic Church, with the lawful, and true, and only baptism of the Church. Respecting which matter, as much as the capacity of my faith and the sanctity and truth of the divine Scriptures suggest, I answer, that no heretics and schismatics at all have any power or right. For which reason Novatian neither ought to be nor can be expected, inasmuch as he also is without the Church and acting in opposition to the peace and love of Christ, from being counted among adversaries and antichrists. For our Lord Jesus Christ, when He testified in His Gospel that those who were not with Him were His adversaries, did not point out any species of heresy, but showed that all whatsoever who were not with Him, and who, not gathering with Him, were scattering His flock, were His adversaries; saying, \"He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.\"[fn-64-P6477_2085279:2-nf] Moreover, the blessed Apostle John himself distinguished no heresy or schism, neither did he set down any as specially separated; but he called all who had gone out from the Church, and who acted in opposition to the Church, antichrists, saying, \"Ye have heard that Antichrist cometh, and even now are come many antichrists; wherefore we know that this is the last time. They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us.\"[fn-64-P6478_2085850:3-nf] Whence it appears, that all are adversaries of the Lord and antichrists, who are known to have departed from charity and from the unity of the Catholic Church. In addition, moreover, the Lord establishes it in His Gospel, and says, \"But if he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a publican.\"[fn-64-P6479_2086198:4-nf] Now if they who despise the Church are counted heathens and publicans, much more certainly is it necessary that rebels and enemies, who forge false altars, and lawless priesthoods, and sacrilegious sacrifices, and corrupter names, should be counted among heathens and publicans; since they who sin less, and are only despisers of the Church, are by the Lord's sentence judged to be heathens and publicans.","title":"Epistle LXXV.","author":"Cyprian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_100_the_canonical_epistle","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"64","folder":"ANF-06","text":"For those who first, when the persecution waxed warm, leaped forth, standing around the judgment-seat, and beholding the holy martyrs who were hastening to the \"prize of their high calling,\"[fn-44-P4416_1334068:40-nf] then, fired with a holy zeal, gave themselves up to this, using much boldness, and especially when they saw those who were drawn aside and lapsed, on their account they were roused mightily within, and, as it were by some inward voice, impelled to war down and subdue the adversary who was exulting; for this they earnestly contended, that he might not seem \"to be wise in his own conceit,\"[fn-44-P4417_1334482:41-nf] on account of those things in which by reason of his subtlety they appeared to be inferior to him, even though it escaped his observation that he was overcome by those who with constancy endured the torments of the lash and scourge, and the sharp edge of the sword, the burning in the fire, and the immersion in the water.

Noah's ark was a type of the Church, as the Apostle Peter says-[fn-59-P5947_1751491:86-nf] \"In Noah's ark few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water: which also after a true likeness doth now save us, even baptism.\" As in the ark there were all kinds of animals, so also in the Church there are men of all races and characters. As in the one there was the leopard with the kids, the wolf with the lambs, so in the other there are found the righteous and sinners, that is,[fn-59-P5948_1751902:87-nf] vessels of gold and silver with those of wood and of earth. The ark had its rooms: the Church has many mansions. Eight souls were saved in Noah's ark. And[fn-59-P5949_1752077:88-nf] Ecclesiastes bids us \"give a portion to seven yea, even unto eight,\" that is to believe both Testaments. This is why some psalms bear the inscription[fn-59-P5950_1752244:89-nf] for the octave, and why the one hundred and nineteenth psalm is divided into portions of eight verses each beginning with its own letter for the instruction of the righteous. The beatitudes which our Lord spoke to his disciples on the mountain, thereby delineating the Church, are eight. And Ezekiel for the building of the temple employs the number eight. And you will find many other things expressed in the same way in the Scriptures. The raven also is sent forth from the ark but does not return, and afterwards the dove announces peace to the earth. So also in the Church's baptism, that most unclean bird the devil is expelled, and the dove of the Holy Spirit announces peace to our earth. The construction of the ark was such that it began with being thirty cubits broad and gradually narrowed to one. Similarly the Church, consisting of many grades, ends in deacons, presbyters, and bishops. The ark was in peril in the flood, the Church is in peril in the world. When Noah left the ark he planted a vineyard, drank thereof, and was drunken. Christ also, born in the flesh, planted the Church and suffered. The elder son made sport of his father's nakedness, the younger covered it: and the Jews mocked God crucified, the Gentiles honoured Him. The daylight would fail me if I were to explain all the mysteries of the ark and compare them with the Church. Who are the eagles amongst us? Who the doves and lions, who the stags, who the worms and serpents? So far as our subject requires I will briefly show you. It is not the sheep only who abide in the Church, nor do clean birds only fly to and fro there; but amid the grain other seed is sown,[fn-59-P5951_1754141:90-nf] \"amidst the neat corn-fields burrs and caltrops and barren oats lord it in the land.\" What is the husbandman to do? Root up the darnel? In that case the whole harvest is destroyed along with it. Every day the farmer diligently drives the birds away with strange noises, or frightens them with scarecrows: here he cracks a whip, there he spreadsout some other object to terrify them. Nevertheless he suffers from the raids of nimble roes or the wantonness of the wild asses; here the mice convey the corn to their garners underground, there the ants crowd thickly in and ravage the corn-field. Thus the case stands. No one who has land is free from care.[fn-59-P5952_1754821:91-nf] While the householder slept the enemy sowed tares among the wheat, and when the servants proposed to go and root them up the master forbade them, reserving for himself the separation of the chaff and the grain.[fn-59-P5953_1755059:92-nf] There are vessels of wrath and of mercy which the Apostle speaks of in the house of God. The day then will come when the storehouses of the Church shall be opened and the Lord will bring forth the vessels of wrath; and, as they depart, the saints will say,[fn-59-P5954_1755378:93-nf] \"They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us.\" No one can take to himself the prerogative of Christ, no one before the day of judgment can pass judgment upon men. If the Church is already cleansed, what shall we reserve for the Lord?[fn-59-P5955_1755707:94-nf] \"There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.\" When our judgment is so prone to error, upon whose opinion can we rely?","title":"The Dialogue Against the Luciferians","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_14_book_viii_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"35","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"12. Let no one say, I do not know what I love. Let him love his brother, and he will love the same love. For he knows the love with which he loves, more than the brother whom he loves. So now he can know God more than he knows his brother: clearly known more, because more present; known more, because more within him; known more, because more certain. Embrace the love of God, and by love embrace God. That is love itself, which associates together all good angels and all the servants of God by the bond of sanctity, and joins together us and them mutually with ourselves, and joins. us subordinately to Himself. In proportion, therefore, as we are healed from the swelling of pride, in such proportion are we more filled with love; and with what is he fall, who is full of love, except with God? Well, but you will say, I see love, and, as far as I am able, I gaze upon it with my mind, and I believe the Scripture, saying, that \"God is love; and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God;\"[fn-12-P1293_575763:30-nf] but when I see love, I do not see in it the Trinity. Nay, but thou dost see the Trinity if thou seest love. But if I can I will put you in mind, that thou mayest see that thou seest it; only let itself be present, that we may be moved by love to something good. Since, when we love love, we love one who loves something, and that on account of this very thing, that he does love something; therefore what does love love, that love itself also may be loved? For that is not love which loves nothing. But if it loves itself it must love something, that it may love itself as love. For as a word indicates something, and indicates also itself, but does not indicate itself to be a word, unless it indicates that it does indicate something; so love also loves indeed itself, but except it love itself as loving something, it loves itself not as love. What therefore does love love, except that which we love with love? But this, to begin from that which is nearest to us, is our brother. And listen how greatly the Apostle John commends brotherly love: \"He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.\"[fn-12-P1294_576931:31-nf] It is manifest that he placed the perfection of righteousness in the love of our brother; for he certainly is perfect in whom \"there is no occasion of stumbling.\" And yet he seems to have passed by the love of God in silence; which he never would have done, unless because he intends God to be understood in brotherly love itself. For in this same epistle, a little further on, he says most plainly thus: \"Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love.\" And this passage declares sufficiently and plainly, that this same brotherly love itself (for that is brotherly love by which we love each other) is set forth by so great authority, not only to be from God, but also to be God. When, therefore, we love our brother from love, we love our brother from God; neither can it be that we do not love above all else that same love by which we love our brother: whence it may be gathered that these two commandments cannot exist unless interchangeably. For since \"God is love,\" he who loves love certainly loves God; but he must needs love love, who loves his brother. And so a little after he says, \"For he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen\"?[fn-12-P1295_578265:32-nf] because the reason that he does not see God is, that he does not love his brother. For he who does not love his brother, abideth not in love; and he who abideth not in love, abideth not in God, because God is love. Further, he who abideth not in God, abideth not in light; for \"God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all.\"[fn-12-P1296_578618:33-nf] He therefore who abideth not in light, what wonder is it if he does not see light, that is, does not see God, because he is in darkness? But he sees his brother with human sight, with which God cannot be seen. But if he loved with spiritual love him whom he sees with human sight, he would see God, who is love itself, with the inner sight by which He can be seen. Therefore he who does not love his brother whom he sees, how can he love God, whom on that account he does not see, because God is love, which he has not who does not love his brother? Neither let that further question disturb us, how much of love we ought to spend upon our brother, and how much upon God: incomparably more upon God than upon ourselves, but upon our brother as much as upon ourselves; and we love ourselves so much the more, the more we love God. Therefore we love God and our neighbor from one and the same love; but we love God for the sake of God, and ourselves and our neighbors for the sake of God.","title":"Book VIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_17_vi_on_monogamy_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"ANF-04","text":"What, now, if he accommodatingly grants all indulgence to marry on the ground of his own (that is, of human) sense, out of the necessity which we have mentioned, inasmuch as \"better it is to marry than to burn? \"In fact, when he turns to the second case, by saying, \"But to the married I officially announce-not I, but the Lord\"-he shows that those things which he had said above had not been (the dictates) of the Lord's authority, but of human judgment.

The words which follow, \"that ye may give yourselves unto prayer, and may be together again,\" might lead one to suppose that the Apostle was expressing a wish and not making a concession because of the danger of a greater fall. He therefore at once adds, \"lest Satan tempt you for your incontinency.\" It is a fine permission which is conveyed in the words \"be together again.\" What it was that he blushed to call by its own name, and thought only better than a temptation of Satan and the effect of incontinence, we take trouble to discuss as if it were obscure, although he has explained his meaning by saying, \"this I say by way of permission, not by way of command.\" And do we still hesitate to speak of marriage as a concession to weakness, not a thing commanded, as though second and third marriages were not allowed on the same ground, as though the doors of the Church were not opened by repentance even to fornicators, and what is more, to the incestuous? Take the case of the man who outraged his step-mother. Does not the Apostle, after delivering him, in his first Epistle to the Corinthians, to Satan for the destruction of the flesh that his spirit might be saved, in the second Epistle take the offender back and strive to prevent a brother from being swallowed up by overmuch grief. The Apostle's wish is one thing, his pardon another. If a wish be expressed, it confers a right; if a thing is only called pardonable, we are wrong in using it. If you wish to know the Apostle's real mind, you must take in what follows: \"but I would that all men were as I am.\" Happy is the man who is like Paul! Fortunate is he who attends to the Apostle's command, not to his concession. This, says he, I wish, this I desire that ye be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ, who was a Virgin born of a Virgin, uncorrupt of her who was uncorrupt. We, because we are men, cannot imitate our Lord's nativity; but we may at least imitate His life. The former was the blessed prerogative of divinity, the latter belongs to our human condition and is part of human effort. I would that all men were like me, that while they are like me, they may also become like Christ, to whom I am like. For[fn-61-P6184_1865179:43-nf] \"he that believeth in Christ ought himself also to walk even as He walked.\"[fn-61-P6185_1865274:44-nf] \"Howbeit each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.\" What I wish, he says, is clear. But since in the Church there is a diversity of gifts, I acquiesce in marriage, lest I should seem to condemn nature. At the same time consider, that the gift of virginity is one, that of marriage, another. For were the reward the same for the married and for virgins, he would never after enjoining continence have said:[fn-61-P6186_1865742:45-nf] \"Each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.\" Where there is a distinction in one particular, there is a diversity also in other points. I grant that even marriage is a gift of God, but between gift and gift there is great diversity. In fact the Apostle himself speaking of the same person who had repented of his incestuous conduct, says:[fn-61-P6187_1866141:46-nf] \"so that contrariwise ye should rather forgive him and comfort him, and to whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also.\" And that we might not think a man's gift contemptible, he added,[fn-61-P6188_1866352:47-nf] \"for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes have I forgiven it, in the presence of Christ.\" There is diversity in the gifts of Christ. Hence it is that by way of type Joseph has a coat of many colours. And in the forty-fifth psalm we read,[fn-61-P6189_1866667:48-nf] \"at thy right hand doth stand the queen in a vesture of gold wrought about with divers colours.\" And the Apostle Peter says,[fn-61-P6190_1866841:49-nf] \"as heirs together of the manifold grace of God,\" where the more expressive Greek word poiki/lhj, i.e., varied, is used.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_10_book_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"40. The Apostle has described Jovinianus speaking with swelling cheeks and nicely balancing his inflated utterances, promising heavenly liberty, when he himself is the slave of vice and self-indulgence, a dog returning to his vomit. For although he boasts of being a monk, he has exchanged his dirty tunic, bare feet, common bread, and drink of water, for a snowy dress, sleek skin, honey-wine and dainty dishes, for the sauces of[fn-64-P6481_2007880:309-nf] Apicius and[fn-64-P6482_2007959:310-nf] Paxamus, for baths and rubbings, and for the cook-shops. Is it not clear that he prefers his belly to Christ, and thinks his ruddy complexion worth the kingdom of heaven? And yet that handsome monk so fat and sleek, and of bright appearance, who always walks with the air of a bridegroom, must either marry a wife if he is to show that virginity and marriage are equal: or if he does not marry one, it is useless for him to bandy words with us when his acts are on our side. And John agrees with this almost to the letter:[fn-64-P6483_2008584:311-nf] \"Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of this life, which is not of the Father, but is of the world.\" And, \"The world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever. A new commandment have I written unto you, which thing is true both in Christ and in you; because the darkness is passing away, and the true light already shineth.\" And again,[fn-64-P6484_2009176:312-nf] \"Beloved, now are we the children of God, and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be. But we know that, if he shall be manifested, we shall be like him: for we shall see him even as he is. And every one that hath this hope purifieth himself, even as he is pure.[fn-64-P6485_2009481:313-nf] Herein is our love made perfect, if we have boldness in the day of judgement: that as he is, even so may we be in this world.\" The Epistle of Jude also expresses nearly the same:[fn-64-P6486_2009707:314-nf] \"Hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.\" Let us read the Apocalypse of John, and we shall there find the Lamb upon Mount Sion,[fn-64-P6487_2009858:315-nf] and with Him \"a hundred and forty-four thousand of them that were sealed, having His name and the name of His Father written in their foreheads, who sing a new song, and no one can sing that song save they who have been redeemed out of the earth. These are they who have not defiled themselves with women, for they continued virgins. These follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth: for they were redeemed from among men, first-fruits to God and to the Lamb, and in their mouth was found no guile, and they are without spot.\"[fn-64-P6488_2010399:316-nf] Out of each tribe, the tribe of Dan excepted, the place of which is taken by the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand virgins who have been sealed are spoken of as future believers, who have not defiled themselves with women. And that we may not suppose the reference to be to those who know not harlots, he immediately added: \"For they continued virgins.\" Whereby he shows that all who have not preserved their virginity, in comparison of pure and angelic chastity and of our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, are defiled.[fn-64-P6489_2010933:317-nf] \"These are they who sing a new song which no man can sing except him that is a virgin. These are first-fruits unto God and unto the Lamb, and are without blemish.\" If virgins are first-fruits, it follows that widows and the continent in marriage, come after the first-fruits, that is, are in the second and third rank: nor can a lost people be saved unless it offer such sacrifices of chastity to God, and with pure victims reconcile the spotless Lamb. It would be endless work to explain the Gospel mystery of the ten virgins, five of whom were wise and five foolish. All I say now is, that as mere virginity without other works does not save, so all works without virginity, purity, continence, chastity, are imperfect. And we shall not be hindered in the least from taking this view by the objection of our opponent that our Lord was at Cana of Galilee, and joined in the marriage festivities when He turned water into wine. I shall very briefly reply, that He Who was circumcised on the eighth day, and for Whom a pair of turtle-doves and two young pigeons were offered on the day of purification, like others before He suffered, shewed His approval of Jewish custom, that He might not seem to give His enemies just cause for putting Him to death on the pretext that He destroyed the law and condemned nature. And even this was done for our sakes. For by going once to a marriage, He taught that men should marry only once. Moreover, at that time it was possible to injure virginity if marriage were not placed next to it, and the purity of widowhood in the third rank. But now when heretics are condemning wedlock, and despise the ordinance of God, we gladly hear anything he[fn-64-P6490_2012650:318-nf] may say in praise of marriage. For the Church does not condemn marriage, but makes it subordinate; nor does she reject it, but regulates it; for she knows, as was said before, that[fn-64-P6491_2012855:319-nf] in a great house there are notonly vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and earthenware; and that some are to honour, some to dishonour; and that whoever cleanses himself will be a vessel of honour, necessary, prepared for every good work.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":16,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_19_vii_on_modesty_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"37","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Plainly, if you show by what patronages of heavenly precedents and precepts it is that you open to adultery alone-and therein to fornication also-the gate of repentance, at this very line our hostile encounter will forthwith cross swords.

For he affirms that we do not sin at all; and to this end he treats at large, that he may make no such concession; setting forth that sins have been once for all deleted by Christ, not subsequently to obtain pardon; in which statement the sense requires us (to apply the statement) to an admonition to chastity. \"Every one,\" he says, \"who hath this hope, maketh himself chaste, because He too is chaste.

On this point, also, in reference to what has been said above, I think we may get a still better understanding of the words, \"A little while, and ye shall no more see me: and again a little while, and ye shall see me.\" For the whole of that space over which the present dispensation extends, is but a little while; and hence this same evangelist says in his epistle, \"It is the last hour.\"[fn-33-P3361_1865300:15-nf] For in this sense also He added, \"Because I go to the Father,\" which is to be referred to the preceding clause, where He saith, \"A little while, and ye shall no more see me;\" and not to the subsequent, where He saith, \"And again a little while, and ye shall see me.\" For by His going to the Father, He was to bring it about that they should not see Him. And on this account, therefore, His words did not mean that He was about to die, and to be withdrawn from their view till His resurrection; but that He was about to go to the Father, which He did after His resurrection, and when, after holding intercourse with them for forty days, He ascended into heaven.[fn-33-P3362_1865982:16-nf] He therefore addressed the words, \"A little while, and ye shall no more see me,\" to those who saw Him at the time in bodily form; because He was about to go to the Father, and never thereafter to be seen in that mortal state wherein they now beheld Him when so addressing them. But the words that He added, \"And again a little while, and ye shall see me,\" He gave as a promise to the Church universal: just as to it, also, He gave the other promise, \"Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.\"[fn-33-P3363_1866509:17-nf] The Lord is not slack concerning His promise: a little while, and we shall see Him, where we shall have no more any requests to make, any questions to put; for nothing shall remain to be desired, nothing lie hid to be inquired about. This little while appears long to us, because it is still in continuance; when it is over, we shall then feel what a little while it was. Let not, then, our joy be like that of the world, whereof it is said, \"But the world shall rejoice;\" and yet let not our sorrow in travailing in birth with such a desire be unmingled with joy; but, as the apostle says, be \"rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation;\"[fn-33-P3364_1867171:18-nf] for even the woman in travail, to whom we are compared, has herself more joy over the offspring that is soon to be, than sorrow over her present pains.

This is the simplicity that ought to be known in the Church, this is the charity that ought to be attained, that so the love of the brotherhood may imitate the cloves, that their gentleness and meekness may be like the lambs and sheep.

For how in that case would the words hold good, \"Who entereth into the house of a strong one to spoil his goods, unless first he shall have bound the strong one?\" Consequently this verse seems to compel us to believe that during that time, short as it is, no one will be added to the Christian community, but that the devil will make war with those who have previously become Christians, and that, though some of these may be conquered and desert to the devil, these do not belong to the predestinated number of the sons of God. For it is not without reason that John, the same apostle as wrote this Apocalypse, says in his epistle regarding certain persons, \"They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have remained with us.\"[fn-38-P3844_2116620:40-nf] But what shall become of the little ones? For it is beyond all belief that in these days there shall not be found some Christian children born, but not yet baptized, and that there shall not also be some born during that very period; and if there be such, we cannot believe that their parents shall not find some way of bringing them to the laver of regeneration. But if this shall be the case, how shall these goods be snatched from the devil when he is loose, since into his house no man enters to spoil his goods unless he has first bound him? On the contrary, we are rather to believe that in these days there shall be no lack either of those who fall away from, or of those who attach themselves to the Church; but there shall be such resoluteness, both in parents to seek baptism for their little ones, and in those who shall then first believe, that they shall conquer that strong one, even though unbound,-that is, shall both vigilantly comprehend, and patiently bear up against him, though employing such wiles and putting forth such force as he never before used; and thus they shall be snatched from him even though unbound. And yet the verse of the Gospel will not be untrue, \"Who entereth into the house of the strong one to spoil his goods, unless he shall first have bound the strong one?\" For in accordance with this true saying that order is observed-the strong one first bound, and then his goods spoiled; for the Church is so increased by the weak and strong from all nations far and near, that by its most robust faith in things divinely predicted and accomplished, it shall be able to spoil the goods of even the unbound devil. For as we must own that, \"when iniquity abounds, the love of many waxes cold,\"[fn-38-P3845_2118369:41-nf] and that those who have not been written in the book of life shall in large numbers yield to the severe and unprecedented persecutions and stratagems of the devil now loosed, so we cannot but think that not only those whom that time shall find sound in the faith, but also some who till then shall be without, shall become firm in the faith they have hitherto rejected and mighty to conquer the devil even though unbound, God's grace aiding them to understand the Scriptures, in which, among other things, there is foretold that very end which they themselves see to be arriving. And if this shall be so, his binding is to be spoken of as preceding, that there might follow a spoiling of him both bound and loosed; for it is of this it is said, \"Who shall enter into the house of the strong one to spoil his goods, unless he shall first have bound the strong one?\"","title":"Book XX","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_26_book_xx","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"87","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Some think that the Apostle Paul referred to the Roman empire, and that he was unwilling to use language more explicit, lest he should incur the calumnious charge of wishing ill to the empire which it was hoped would be eternal; so that in saying, \"For the mystery of iniquity doth already work,\" he alluded to Nero, whose deeds already seemed to be as the deeds of Antichrist. And hence some suppose that he shall rise again and be Antichrist. Others, again, suppose that he is not even dead, but that he was concealed that he might be supposed to have been killed, and that he now lives in concealment in the vigor of that same age which he had reached when he was believed to have perished, and will live until he is revealed in his own time and restored to his kingdom.[fn-39-P3936_2161605:94-nf] But I wonder that men can be so audacious in their conjectures. However, it is not absurd to believe that these words of the apostle, \"Only he who now holdeth, let him hold until he be taken out of the way,\" refer to the Roman empire, as if it were said, \"Only he who now reigneth, let him reign until he be taken out of the way.\" \"And then shall the wicked be revealed:\" no one doubts that this means Antichrist. But others think that the words, \"Ye know what withholdeth,\" and \"The mystery of iniquity worketh,\" refer only to the wicked and the hypocrites who are in the Church, until they reach a number so great as to furnish Antichrist with a great people, and that this is the mystery of iniquity, because it seems hidden; also that the apostle is exhorting the faithful tenaciously to hold the faith they hold when he says, \"Only he who now holdeth, let him hold until he be taken out of the way,\" that is, until the mystery of iniquity which now is hidden departs from the Church. For they suppose that it is to this same mystery John alludes when in his epistle he says, \"Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that Antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time. They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us.\"[fn-39-P3937_2163002:95-nf] As therefore there went out from the Church many heretics, whom John calls \"many antichrists,\" at that time prior to the end, and which John calls \"the last time,\" so in the end they shall go out who do not belong to Christ, but to that last Antichrist, and then he shall be revealed.","title":"Book XX","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_26_book_xx","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"104","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"There are many allusions to the last judgment in the Psalms, but for the most part only casual and slight. I cannot, however, omit to mention what is said there in express terms of the end of this world: \"In the beginning hast Thou laid the foundations of the earth, O Lord; and the heavens are the work of Thy hands. They shall perish, but Thou shall endure; yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; and as a vesture Thou shall change them, and they shall be changed: but Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail.\"[fn-39-P3992_2191743:128-nf] Why is it that Porphyry, while he lauds the piety of the Hebrews in worshipping a God great and true, and terrible to the gods themselves, follows the oracles of these gods in accusing the Christians of extreme folly because they say that this world shall perish? For here we find it said in the sacred books of the Hebrews, to that God whom this great philosopher acknowledges to be terrible even to the gods themselves, \"The heavens are the work of Thy hands; they shall perish.\" When the heavens, the higher and more secure part of the world, perish, shall the world itself be preserved? If this idea is not relished by Jupiter, whose oracle is quoted by this philosopher as an unquestionable authority in rebuke of the credulity of the Christians, why does he not similarly rebuke the wisdom of the Hebrews as folly, seeing that the prediction is found in their most holy books? But if this Hebrew wisdom, with which Porphyry is so captivated that he extols it through the utterances of his own gods, proclaims that the heavens are to perish, how is he so infatuated as to detest the faith of the Christians partly, if not chiefly, on this account, that they believe the world is to perish?-though how the heavens are to perish if the world does not is not easy to see. And, indeed, in the sacred writings which arepeculiar to ourselves, and not common to the Hebrews and us,-I mean the evangelic and apostolic books,-the following expressions are used: \"The figure of this world passeth away;\"[fn-39-P3993_2193265:129-nf] \"The world passeth away;\"[fn-39-P3994_2193314:130-nf] \"Heaven and earth shall pass away,\"[fn-39-P3995_2193372:131-nf] -expressions which are, I fancy, somewhat milder than \"They shall perish.\" In the Epistle of the Apostle Peter, too, where the world which then was is said to have perished, being overflowed with water, it is sufficiently obvious What part of the world is signified by the whole, and in what sense the word perished is to be taken, and what heavens were kept instore, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.[fn-39-P3996_2193840:132-nf] And when he says a little afterwards, \"The day of the Lord will come as a thief; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great rush, and the elements shall melt with burning heat, and the earth and the works which are in it shall be burned up and then adds, \"Seeing, then, that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be?\"[fn-39-P3997_2194225:133-nf] -these heavens which are to perish may be understood to be the same which he said were kept in store reserved for fire; and the elements which are to be burned are those which are full of storm and disturbance in this lowest part of the world in which he said that these heavens were kept in store; for the higher heavens in whose firmament are set the stars are safe, and remain in their integrity. For even the expression of Scripture, that \"the stars shall fall from heaven,\"[fn-39-P3998_2194731:134-nf] not to mention that a different interpretation is much preferable, rather shows that the heavens themselves shall remain, if the stars are to fall from them.

We answer, then, nothing of these qualities, inasmuch as the difference of sex belongs to \"the vessels\" of the parents; while the union of the two pertains to the procreation of children; and their fruitfulness to the blessing pronounced on the marriage institution. But all these things are of God; yet amongst them he was unwilling to name that \"lust of the flesh, which is not of the Father, but is of the world;\"[fn-41-P4165_1569934:34-nf] and \"of this world\" the devil is said to be \"the prince.\"[fn-41-P4166_1570012:35-nf] Now, the devil found no carnal concupiscence in the Lord, because the Lord did not come as a man to men by its means.

For why is the especial work of parents withdrawn and hidden even from the eyes of their children, except that it is impossible for them to be occupied in laudable procreation without shameful lust?

And therefore in the Gospel He threatens, and says: \"Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before my Father which is in heaven; but whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.\"[fn-78-P7804_2619974:37-nf] The Apostle Paul also says: \"For if we die with Him, we shall also live with Him; if we suffer, we shall also reign with Him; if we deny Him, He also will deny us.\"[fn-78-P7805_2620161:38-nf] John too: \"Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father; he that acknowledgeth the Son, hath both the Son and the Father.\"[fn-78-P7806_2620319:39-nf] Whence the Lord exhorts and strengthens us to contempt of death, saying: \"Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear Him which is able to kill soul and body in Gehenna.\"[fn-78-P7807_2620553:40-nf] And again: \"He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he who hateth his life in this world, shall keep it unto life eternal.\"[fn-78-P7808_2620698:41-nf] ","title":"Treatise XI.

Augustin replied: If you allow, in consideration of the authority of the Gospel, that Christ said that He came not to destroy the law and the prophets, but to fulfill them, you should show the same consideration to the authority of the apostle, when he says, \"All these things were our examples;\" and again of Christ, \"He was not yea and nay, but in Him was yea; for all the promises of God are in Him yea;\"[fn-18-P1826_1029214:9-nf] that is, they are set forth and fulfilled in Him. In this way you will see in the clearest light both what law Christ fulfilled, and how He fulfilled it. It is a vain attempt that you make to escape by your three kinds of law and your three kinds of prophets. It is quite plain, and the New Testament leaves no doubt on the matter, what law and what prophets Christ came not to destroy, but to fulfill. The law given by Moses is that which by Jesus Christ became grace and truth.[fn-18-P1827_1029716:10-nf] The law given by Moses is that of which Christ says, \"He wrote of me.\"[fn-18-P1828_1029804:11-nf] For undoubtedly this is the law which entered that the offence might abound;[fn-18-P1829_1029898:12-nf] words which you often ignorantly quote as a reproach to the law. Read what is there said of this law: \"The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, wrought death in me by that which is good.\"[fn-18-P1830_1030220:13-nf] The entrance of the law made the offense abound, not because the law required what was wrong, but because the proud and self-confident incurred additional guilt as transgressors after their acquaintance with the holy, and just, and good commandments of the law; so that, being thus humbled, they might learn that only by grace through faith could they be freed from subjection to the law as transgressors, and be reconciled to the law as righteous. So the same apostle says: \"For before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which was afterwards revealed. Therefore the law was our schoolmaster in Christ Jesus; but after faith came, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.\"[fn-18-P1831_1030943:14-nf] That is, we are no longer subject to the penalty of the law, because we are set free by grace. Before we received in humility the grace of the Spirit, the letter was only death to us, for it required obedience which we could not render. Thus Paul also says: \"The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.\"[fn-18-P1832_1031274:15-nf] Again, he says: \"For if a law had been given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law; but the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.\"[fn-18-P1833_1031546:16-nf] And once more: \"What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sent His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, that by sin He might condemn sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.\"[fn-18-P1834_1031861:17-nf] Here we see Christ coming not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it. As the law brought the proud under the guilt of transgression, increasing their sin by commandments which they could not obey, so the righteousness of the same law is fulfilled by the grace of the Spirit in those who learn from Christ to be meek and lowly in heart; for Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it. Moreover, because even for those who are under grace it is difficult in this mortal life perfectly to keep what is written in the law, Thou shall not covet, Christ, by the sacrifice of His flesh, as our Priest obtains pardon for us. And in this also He fulfills the law; for what we fail in through weakness is supplied by His perfection, who is the Head, while we are His members. Thus John says: \"My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not; and if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: He is the propitiation for our sins.\"[fn-18-P1835_1032867:18-nf] ","title":"Book XIX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"173","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In the Gospel: \"I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one cometh to the Father but by me.\"[fn-83-P8369_2756368:292-nf] Also in the same place: \"I am the door: by me if any man shall enter in, he shall be saved.\"[fn-83-P8370_2756481:293-nf] Also in the same place: \"Many prophets and righteous men have desired to see the things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.\"[fn-83-P8371_2756691:294-nf] Also in the same place: \"He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life: he that is not obedient in word to the Son hath not life; but the wrath of God shall abide upon him.\"[fn-83-P8372_2756889:295-nf] Also Paul to the Ephesians: \"And when He had come, He preached peace to you, to those which are afar off, and peace to those which are near, because through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.\"[fn-83-P8373_2757123:296-nf] Also to the Romans: \"For all have sinned, and fail of the glory of God; but they are justified by His gift and grace, through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus.\"[fn-83-P8374_2757316:297-nf] Also in the Epistle of Peter the apostle: \"Christ hath died once for our sins, the just for the unjust, that He might present us to God.\"[fn-83-P8375_2757479:298-nf] Also in the same place: \"For in this also was it preached to them that are dead, that they might be raised again.\"[fn-83-P8376_2757617:299-nf] Also in the Epistle of John: \"Whosoever denieth the Son, the same also hath not the Father.

I am often led to wonder when I consider the things that are said about Christ, even by those who are in earnest in their belief in Him. Though there is a countless number of names which can be applied to our Saviour, they omit the most of them, and if they should remember them, they declare that these titles are not to be understood in their proper sense, but tropically. But when they come to the title Logos (Word), and repeat that Christ alone is the Word of God, they are not consistent, and do not, as in the case of the other titles, search out what is behind the meaning of the term \"Word.\" I wonder at the stupidity of the general run of Christians in this matter. I do not mince matters; it is nothing but stupidity. The Son of God says in one passage, \"I am the light of the world,\" and in another, \"I am the resurrection,\" and again, \"I am the way and the truth and the life.\" It is also written, \"I am the door,\" and we have the saying, \"I am the good shepherd,\" and when the woman of Samaria says, \"We know the Messiah is coming, who is called Christ; when He comes, He will tell us all things,\" Jesus answers, \"I that speak unto thee am He.\" Again, when He washed the disciples' feet, He declared Himself in these words[fn-62-P6254_982473:92-nf] to be their Master and Lord: \"You call Me Master and Lord, and you say well, for so I am.\" He also distinctly announces Himself as the Son of God, when He says,[fn-62-P6255_982654:93-nf] \"He whom the Father sanctified and sent unto the world, to Him do you say, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God? \"and[fn-62-P6256_982806:94-nf] \"Father, the hour is come; glorify Thy Son, that the Son also may glorify Thee.\" We also find Him declaring Himself to be a king, as when He answers Pilate's question,[fn-62-P6257_982993:95-nf] \"Art Thou the King of the Jews? \"by saying, \"My kingdom is not of this world; if My kingdom were of this world, then would My servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews, but now is My kingdom not from hence.\" We have also read the words,[fn-62-P6258_983272:96-nf] \"I am the true vine and My Father is the husbandman,\" and again, \"I am the vine, ye are the branches.\" Add to these testimonies also the saying,[fn-62-P6259_983437:97-nf] \"I am the bread of life, that came down from heaven and giveth life to the world.\" These texts will suffice for the present, which we have picked up out of the storehouse of the Gospels, and in all of which He claims to be the Son of God. But in the Apocalypse of John, too, He says,[fn-62-P6260_983747:98-nf] \"I am the first and the last, and the living One, and I was dead. Behold, I am alive for evermore.\" And again,[fn-62-P6261_983876:99-nf] \"I am the A and the W, and the first and the last, the beginning and the end.\" The careful student of the sacred books, moreover, may gather not a few similar passages from the prophets, as where He calls Himself[fn-62-P6262_984111:100-nf] a chosen shaft, and a servant of God,[fn-62-P6263_984170:101-nf] and a light of the Gentiles.[fn-62-P6264_984225:102-nf] Isaiah also says,[fn-62-P6265_984264:103-nf] \"From my mother's womb hath He called me by my name, and He made my mouth as a sharp sword, and under the shadow of His hand did He hide me, and He said to me, Thou art My servant, O Israel, and in thee will I be glorified.\" And a little farther on: \"And my God shall be my strength, and He said to me, This is a great thing for thee to be called My servant, to set up the tribes of Jacob and to turn again the diaspora of Israel. Behold I have set thee for a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation to the end of the earth.\" And in Jeremiah too[fn-62-P6266_984857:104-nf] He likens Himself to a lamb, as thus: \"I was as a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter.\" These and other similar sayings He applies to Himself. In addition to these one might collect in the Gospels and the Apostles and in the prophets a countless number of titles which are applied to the Son of God, as the writers of the Gospels set forth their own views of what He is, or the Apostles extol Him out of what they had learned, or the prophets proclaim in advance His coining advent and announce the things concerning Him under various names. Thus John calls Him the Lamb of God, saying,[fn-62-P6267_985471:105-nf] \"Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world,\" and in these words he declares Him as a man,[fn-62-P6268_985601:106-nf] \"This is He about whom I said, that there cometh after me a man who is there before me; for He was before me.\" And in his Catholic Epistle John says that He is a Paraclete for our souls with the Father, as thus:[fn-62-P6269_985836:107-nf] \"And if any one sin, we have a Paraclete with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous,\" and he adds that He is a propitiation for our sins, and similarly Paul says He is a propitiation:[fn-62-P6270_986050:108-nf] \"Whom God set forth as a propitiation through faith in His blood, on account of forgiveness of the forepast sins, in the forbearance of God.\" According to Paul, too, He is declared to be the wisdom and the power of God, as in the Epistle to the Corinthians:[fn-62-P6271_986344:109-nf] \"Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.\" It is added that He is also sanctification and redemption: \"He was made to us of God,\" he says, \"wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.\" But he also teaches us, writing to the Hebrews, that Christ is a High-Priest:[fn-62-P6272_986654:110-nf] \"Having, therefore, a great High-Priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.\" And the prophets have other names for Him besides these. Jacob in his blessing of his sons[fn-62-P6273_986898:111-nf] says, \"Judah, thy brethren shall extol thee; thy hands are on the necks of thine enemies. A lion's whelp is Judah, from a shoot, my son, art thou sprung up; thou hast lain down and slept as a lion; who shall awaken him? \"We cannot now linger over these phrases, to show that what is said of Judah applies to Christ. What may be quoted against this view, viz., \"A ruler shall not part from Judah nor a leader from his loins, until He come for whom it is reserved; \"this can better be cleared up on another occasion . But Isaiah knows Christ to be spoken of under the names of Jacob and Israel, when he says,[fn-62-P6274_987528:112-nf] \"Jacob is my servant, I will help Him; Israel is my elect, my soul hath accepted Him. He shall declare judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not strive nor cry, neither shall any one hear His voice on the streets. A bruised rod shall He not break. and smoking flax shall He not quench, till He bring forth judgment from victory, and in His name shall the nations hope.\" That it is Christ about whom such prophecies are made, Matthew shows in his Gospel, where he quotes from memory and says:[fn-62-P6275_988040:113-nf] \"That the saying might be fulfilled, He shall not strive nor cry,\" etc. David also is called Christ, as where Ezekiel in his prophecy to the shepherds adds as from the mouth of God:[fn-62-P6276_988248:114-nf] \"I will raise up David my servant, who shall be their shepherd.\" For it is not the patriarch David who is to rise and be the shepherd of the saints, but Christ. Isaiah also called Christ the rod and the flower:[fn-62-P6277_988483:115-nf] \"There shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower shall spring out of tits root, and the spirit of God shall rest upon Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel slid of might, the spirit of knowledge and of godliness, and He shall be full of the spirit of the fear of the Lord.\" And in the Psalms our Lord is called the stone, as follows:[fn-62-P6278_988887:116-nf] \"The stone which the builders rejected is made the head of the comer. It is from the Lord, and it is wonderful in our eyes.\" And the Gospel shows, as also does Luke in the Acts, that the stone is no other than Christ; the Gospel as follows:[fn-62-P6279_989155:117-nf] \"Have ye never read, the stone which the builders rejected is made the head of the corner. Whosoever falls on this stone shall be broken, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.\" And Luke writes in Acts:[fn-62-P6280_989407:118-nf] \"This is the stone, which was set at naught of you the builders, which has become the head of the corner.\" And one of the names applied to the Saviour is that which He Himself does not utter, but which John records;-the Word who was in the beginning with God, God the Word. And it is worth our while to fix our attention for a moment on those scholars who omit consideration of most of the great names we have mentioned and regard this as the most important one. As to the former titles, they look for any account of them that any one may offer, but in the case of this one they proceed differently and ask, What is the Son of God when called the Word? The passage they employ most is that in the Psalms,[fn-62-P6281_990132:119-nf] \"My heart hath produced a good Word; \"and they imagine the Son of God to be the utterance of the Father deposited, as it were, in syllables, and accordingly they do not allow Him, if we examine them farther, any independent hypostasis, nor are they clear about His essence. I do not mean that they confuse its qualities, but the fact of His having an essence of His own. For no one can understand how that which is said to be \"Word\" can be a Son. And such an animated Word, not being a separate entity from the Father, and accordingly as it, having no subsistence. is not a Son, or if he is a Son, let them say that God the Word is a separate being and has an essence of His own. We insist, therefore, that as in the case of each of the titles spoken of above we turn from the title to the concept it suggests slid apply it and demonstrate how the Son of God is suitably described by it, the same course must be followed when we find Him called the Word. What caprice it is, in all these cases, not to stand upon the term employed, but to enquire in what sense Christ is to be understood to be the door, and in what way the vine, and why He is the way; but in the one case of His being called the Word, to follow a different course. To add to the authority, therefore, of what we have to say on the question, how the Son of God is the Word, we must begin with those names of which we spoke first as being applied to Him. This, we cannot deny, will seem to some to be superfluous and a digression, but the thoughtful reader will not think it useless to ask as to the concepts for which the titles are used; to observe these matters will clear the way for what is coming. And once we have entered upon the theology concerning the Saviour, as we seek with what diligence we can and find the various things that are taught about Him, we shall necessarily understand more about Him not only in His character as the Word, but in His other characters also.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_36_against_lying_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"38","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"31. But he who says that some lies are just, must be judged to say no other than that some sins are just, and therefore some things are just which are unjust: than which what can be more absurd? For whence is a thing a sin, but for that it is contrary to justice? Be it said then that some sins are great, some small, because it is true; and let us not listen to the Stoics who maintain all to be equal: but to say that some sins are unjust, some just, what else is it than to say that there be some unjust, some just iniquities? When the Apostle John saith, \"Every man who doeth sin, doeth also iniquity and sin is iniquity.\"[fn-44-P4473_2190280:59-nf] It is impossible therefore that a sin should be just, unless when we put the name of sin upon another thing in which one doth not sin, but either doeth or suffereth aught for sin. Namely, both sacrifices for sins are named \"sins,\" and the punishments of sins are sometimes called sins. These doubtless can be understood to be just sins, when just sacrifices are spoken of, or just punishments. But those things which are done against God's law cannot be just. It is said unto God, \"Thy law is truth:\"[fn-44-P4474_2190813:60-nf] and consequently, what is against truth cannot be just. Now who can doubt that every lie isagainst truth?

And John crieth out, \"No lie is of the truth.\"[fn-44-P4475_2191106:61-nf] No lie therefore is just.

It remains then that we understand as concerning those women, whether in Egypt or in Jericho, that for their humanity and mercy they received a reward, in any wise temporal, which indeed itself, while they wist not of it, should by prophetical signification prefigure somewhat eternal. But whether it be ever right, even for the saving of a man's life, to tell a lie, as it is a question in resolving which even the most learned do weary themselves, it did vastly surpass the capacity of those poor women, set in the midst of those nations, and accustomed to those manners. Therefore their ignorance in this as well as in those other things of which they were alike unknowing, but which are to be known by the children not of this world but of that which is to come, the patience of God did bear withal: Who yet, for their human kindness which they had shown to His servants, rendered unto them rewards of an earthly sort, albeit signifying somewhat of an heavenly. And Rahab, indeed, delivered out of Jericho, made transition into the people of God, where, being proficient, she might attain to eternal and immortal prizes which are not to be sought by any lie. Yet at that time when she did for the Israelite spies that good, and, for her condition of life, laudable work, she was not as yet such that it should be required of her, \"In your mouth let Yea be yea, Nay nay.\"[fn-44-P4482_2194768:66-nf] But as for those midwives, albeit Hebrewesses, if they savored only after the flesh, what or how great is the good they got of their temporal reward in that they made them houses, unless by making proficiency they attained unto that house of which is sung unto God, \"Blessed are they that dwell in thine house; for ever and ever they will praise thee?\"[fn-44-P4483_2195139:67-nf] It must be confessed, however, that it approacheth much unto righteousness, and though not yet in reality, even now in respect of hopefulness and disposition that mind is to be praised, which never lies except with intention and will to do good to some man, but to hurt no man. But as for us, when we ask whether it be the part of a good man sometimes to lie, we ask not concerning a person pertaining to Egypt, or to Jericho, or to Babylon, or still to Jerusalem itself, the earthly, which is in bondage with her children;[fn-44-P4484_2195683:68-nf] but concerning a citizen of that city which is above and free, our mother, eternal in the heavens.

Add to this, (and here is cause to cry out more piteously,) that, if once we grant it to have been tight for the saving of that sick man's life to tell him the lie, that his son was alive, then, by little and little and by minute degrees, the evil so grows upon us, and by slight accesses to such a heap of wicked lies does it, in its almost imperceptible encroachments, at last come, that no place can ever be any where found on which this huge mischief, by smallest additions rising into boundless strength, might be resisted. Wherefore, most providently is it written, \"He that despiseth small things shall fall by little and little.\"[fn-44-P4499_2205142:79-nf] Nay more: for these persons who are so enamored of this life, that they hesitate not to prefer it to truth, that a man may not die, say rather, that a man who must some time die may die somewhat later, would have us not only to lie, but even to swear fasely; to wit, that, test the vain health of man should somewhat more quickly pass away, we should take the name of the Lord our God in vain! And there are among them learned men who even fix rules, and set bounds when it is a duty, when not a duty, to commit perjury! O, where are ye, fountains of tears? And what shall we do? whither go? where hide us from the ire of truth, if we not only neglect to shun lies, but dare moreover to teach perjuries? For look they well to it, who uphold and defend lying, what kind, or what kinds, of lying they shall delight to justify: at least in the worship of God let them grant that there must be no lying; at least let them keep themselves from perjuries and blasphemies; at least there, where God's name, where God as witness, where God's oath[fn-45-P4500_2206202:80-nf] is interposed, where God's religion is the matter of discourse or colloquy, let none lie, none praise, none teach and enjoin, none justify a lie: of the other kinds of lies let him choose him out that which he accounteth to be the mildest and most innocent kind of lying, he who will have it to be right to lie.

But if, in order that he may be able to find some disciple, he upholds that he teaches a truth when he readies that it is meet to lie, how will that lie be of the truth, when the Apostle John reclaimeth, \"No lie is of the truth?\"[fn-45-P4501_2207027:81-nf] It is therefore not true, that it is sometimes right to lie; and that which is not true to no man is at all to be persuaded.","title":"Against Lying.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_38_book_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"87","folder":"ANF-10","text":"\"He came for a witness that He might bear witness of the light, that all through Him might believe.\"[fn-66-P6608_1144524:102-nf] Some of the dissenters from the Church's doctrine, men who profess to believe in Christ, have desired another being, as indeed their system requires, besides the Creator, and hence cannot allow His coming to the world to have been foretold by the prophets.[fn-66-P6609_1144799:103-nf] They therefore endeavour to get rid of the testimonies of the prophets about Christ, and say that the Son of God has no need of witnesses, but that He brings with Him His own evidence, partly in the sound words full of power which He proclaimed and partly in the wonderful works He did, which were sufficient at once to convince any one whatever. Then they say: If Moses is believed on account of his word and his works, and has no need of any witnesses to announce him beforehand, and if the prophets were received, every one of them, by these people, as messengers from God, how should not one who is much greater than Moses and the prophets accomplish His mission and benefit the human race, without prophets to bear witness about Him? They regard it as superfluous that He should have been foretold by the prophets, since the prophets were concerned, as these opponents would say, that those who believed in Christ should not receive Him as a new God, and therefore did what they could to bring them to that same God whom Moses and the prophets taught before Jesus. To this we must say that as there are many causes which may lead men to believe, since men who are not moved by one argument may be by another, so God is able to provide for men a number of occasions, any of which may cause their minds to open to the truth that God, who is over all, has taken on Himself human nature. It is manifest to all, how some are brought by the prophetic writings to the admiration of Christ. They are astounded at the voices of so many prophets before Him, which establish the place of His birth, the country of His upbringing, the power of His teaching, His working of wonderful works, and His human passion brought to a close by His resurrection. We must notice, too, that Christ's stupendous acts of power were able to bring to the faith those of Christ's own time, but that they lost their demonstrative force with the lapse of years and began to be regarded as mythical. Greater evidential value than that of the miracles then performed attaches to the comparison which we now make between these miracles and the prophecy of them; this makes it impossible for the student to cast any doubt on the former. The prophetic testimonies do not declare merely the advent of the Messiah; it is by no means the case that they teach this and nothing else. They teach a great deal of theology. The relation of the Father to the Son and of the Son to the Father may be learned not less from what the prophets announce about Christ, than from the Apostles narrating the splendours of the Son of God. A parallel case, which we may venture to adduce, is that of the martyrs, who were honoured by the witness they bore Him, and by no means conferred any favour on Him by their witnessing for the Son of God. And how is it if, as many of Christ's true disciples were honoured by having thus to witness for Him, so the prophets received from God as their special gift that of understanding about Christ and announcing Him before, and that they taught not only those living after Christ's advent how they should regard the Son of God, but those also who lived in the generations before Him? As he who in these times does not know the Son has not the Father either,[fn-66-P6610_1148110:104-nf] so also we are to understand it was in these earlier times. Hence \"Abraham rejoiced to see the day of Christ, and he saw it and was glad.\"[fn-66-P6611_1148271:105-nf] He, therefore, who declares that they are not to testify about Christ is seeking to deprive the chorus of the prophets of the greatest gift they have; for what office of equal importance would be left to prophecy, inspired as it is by the Holy Spirit, if all connection with the economy of our Lord and Master were taken away from it? For as these have their faith well ordered who approach the God of the universe through Mediator and High-Priest and Paraclete, and as his religion is a halting one who does not go in through the door to the Father, so also in the case of men of old time. Their religion was sanctified and made acceptable to God by their knowledge and faith and expectation of Christ. For we have observed that God declares Himself to be a witness and exhorts them all to declare the same about Christ, and to be imitators of Him, bearing witness of Him to all who require it. For he says,[fn-66-P6612_1149202:106-nf] \"Be witnesses for Me, and I am witness, saith the Lord God, and My servant whom I have chosen.\" Now every one who bears witness to the truth, whether he support it by words or deeds, or in whatever way, may properly be called a witness (martyr); but it has come to be the custom of the brotherhood, since they are struck with admiration of those who have contended to the death for truth and valour, to keep the name of martyr more properly for those who have borne witness to the mystery of godliness by shedding their blood for it. The Saviour gives the name of martyr to every one who bears witness to the truth He declares; thus at the Ascension He says to His disciples:[fn-66-P6613_1149901:107-nf] \"You shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in Judaea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth.\" The leper who was cleansed[fn-66-P6614_1150059:108-nf] had still to bring the gift which Moses commanded for a testimony to those who did not believe in the Christ. In the same way the martyrs bear witness for a testimony to the unbelieving, and so do all the saints whose deeds shine before men. They spend their life rejoicing in the cross of Christ and bearing witness to the true light.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":20,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_41_book_i_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"39","folder":"ANF-02","text":"And about your laughing at me and calling me \"Christian,\" you know not what you are saying.

With regard to which the Apostle John saith; \"Love not the world,neither the things that be in the world.

And therefore to that false patience it is possible that, without aid of God, the human will may suffice; harder, in proportion as it is more eager of lust, and bearing ills with the more endurance the worse itself becometh: while to this, which is true patience, the human will, unless aided and inflamed from above, doth not suffice, for the very reason that the Holy Spirit is the fire thereof; by Whom unless it be kindled to love that impassible Good, it is not able to bear the ill which it suffereth.","title":"On Patience","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_38_on_patience","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"15.

Suppose now that by some means Jesus were also called Vestitus (Clothed), as He is actually called Christ from the mystery of His anointing, would you in like manner say that Jesus was the Son of God, and at the same time suppose that Vestitus was the Father? Now then, concerning Christ, if Christ is the Father, the Father is an Anointed One, and receives the unction of course from another. Else if it is from Himself that He receives it, then you must prove it to us. But we learn no such fact from the Acts of the Apostles in that ejaculation of the Church to God, \"Of a truth, Lord, against Thy Holy Child Jesus, whom Thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the people of Israel were gathered together.\"[fn-108-P10857_3048785:396-nf] These then testified both that Jesus was the Son of God, and that being the Son, He was anointed by the Father. Christ therefore must be the same as Jesus who was anointed by the Father, and not the Father, who anointed the Son. To the same effect are the words of Peter: \"Let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ,\" that is, Anointed.[fn-108-P10858_3049223:397-nf] John, moreover, brands that man as \"a liar\" who \"denieth that Jesus is the Christ; \"whilst on the other hand he declares that \"every one is born of God who believeth that Jesus is the Christ.\"[fn-108-P10859_3049436:398-nf] Wherefore he also exhorts us to believe in the name of His (the Father's, ) Son Jesus Christ, that \"our fellowship may be with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.\"[fn-108-P10860_3049653:399-nf] Paul, in like manner, everywhere speaks of \"God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.\" When writing to the Romans, he gives thanks to God through our Lord Jesus Christ.[fn-108-P10861_3049843:400-nf] To the Galatians he declares himself to be \"an apostle not of men, neither by man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father.\"[fn-108-P10862_3049990:401-nf] You possess indeed all his writings, which testify plainly to the same effect, and set forth Two-God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father. (They also testify) that Jesus is Himself the Christ, and under one or the other designation the Son of God. For precisely by the same right as both names belong to the same Person, even the Son of God, does either name alone without the other belong to the same Person. Consequently, whether it be the name Jesus which occurs alone, Christ is also understood, because Jesus is the Anointed One; or if the name Christ is the only one given, then Jesus is identified with Him, because the Anointed One is Jesus. Now, of these two names Jesus Christ, the former is the proper one, which was given to Him by the angel; and the latter is only an adjunct, predicable of Him from His anointing,-thussuggesting the proviso that Christ must be the Son, not the Father. How blind, to be sure, is the man who fails to perceive that by the name of Christ some other God is implied, if he ascribes to the Father this name of Christ! For if Christ is God the Father, when He says, \"I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God,\"[fn-108-P10863_3051210:402-nf] He of course shows plainly enough that there is above Himself another Father and another God.

Nevertheless, he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.\"[fn-59-P5920_2316806:26-nf] And so again,\" If I do this willingly, I have a reward;\"[fn-59-P5921_2316888:27-nf] while in another passage he says, \"Be ye sober and righteous, and sin not;\"[fn-59-P5922_2316984:28-nf] and again, \"As ye have a readiness to will, so also let there be a prompt performance;\"[fn-59-P5923_2317092:29-nf] then he remarks to Timothy about the younger widows, \"When they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they choose to marry.\" So in another passage, \"All that will to live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution;\"[fn-59-P5924_2317337:30-nf] while to Timothy himself he says, \"Neglect not the gift that is in thee.\"[fn-59-P5925_2317432:31-nf] Then to Philemon he addresses this explanation: \"That thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but of thine own will.\"[fn-59-P5926_2317581:32-nf] Servants also he advises to obey their masters \"with a good will.\"[fn-59-P5927_2317666:33-nf] In strict accordance with this, James says: \"Do not err, my beloved brethren . . . and have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ with respect to persons;\"[fn-59-P5928_2317840:34-nf] and,\" Do not speak evil one of another.\"[fn-59-P5929_2317908:35-nf] So also John in his Epistle writes,\" Do not love the world,\"[fn-59-P5930_2317987:36-nf] and other things of the same import. Now wherever it is said, \"Do not do this,\" and \"Do not do that,\" and wherever there is any requirement in the divine admonitions for the work of the will to do anything, or to refrain from doing anything, there is at once a sufficient proof of free will. No man, therefore, when he sins, can in his heart blame God for it, but every man must impute the fault to himself. Nor does it detract at all from a man's own will when he performs any act in accordance with God.

If therefore any one of us wishes to be taken by Jesus, and led up by Him into the high mountain, and be deemed worthy of beholding His transfiguration apart, let him pass beyond the six days, because he no longer beholds the things which are seen, nor longer loves the world, nor the things in the world,[fn-81-P8143_1747166:228-nf] nor lusts after any worldly lust, which is the lust of bodies, and of the riches of the body, and of the glory which is after the flesh, and whatever things whose nature it is to distract and drag away the soul from the things which are better and diviner, and bring it down and fix it fast to the deceit of this age, in wealth and glory, and the rest of the lusts which are the foes of truth.

Be this far from being so, however, if these were of those who are predestinated and called according to His purpose,-who are truly the children of the promise. For the former, while they live piously, are called children of God; but because they will live wickedly, and die in that impiety, the foreknowledge of God does not call them God's children. For they are children of God whom as yet we have not, and God has already, of whom the Evangelist John says, \"that Jesus should die for that nation, and not for that nation only, but that also He should gather together in one the children of God which were scattered abroad;\"[fn-64-P6458_2468807:78-nf] and this certainly they were to become by believing, through the preaching of the gospel. And yet before this had happened they had already been enrolled as sons of God with unchangeable stedfastness in the memorial of their Father. And, again, there are some who are called by us children of God on account of grace received even in temporal things, yet are not so called by God; of whom the same John says, \"They went out from us, but they were not of us, because if they had been of us they would, no doubt, have continued with us.\"[fn-64-P6459_2469365:79-nf] He does not say, \"They went out from us, but because they did not abide with us they are no longer now of us;\" but he says, \"They went out from us, but they were not of us,\"-that is to say, even when they appeared among us, they were not of us. And as if it were said to him, Whence do you prove this? he says, \"Because if they had been of us, they would assuredly have continued with us.\"[fn-64-P6460_2469776:80-nf] It is the word of God's children; John is the speaker, who was ordained to a chief place among the children of God. When, therefore, God's children say of those who had not perseverance, \"They went out from us, but they were not of us,\" and add, \"Because if they had been of us, they would assuredly have continued with us,\" what else do they say than that they were not children, even when they were in the profession and name of children? Not because they simulated righteousness, but because they did not continue in it. For he does not say, \"For if they had been of us, they would assuredly have maintained a real and not a feigned righteousness with us;\" but he says, \"If they had been of us, they would assuredly have continued with us.\" Beyond a doubt, he wished them to continue in goodness. Therefore they were in goodness; but because they did not abide in it,-that is, they did not persevere unto the end,-he says, They were not of us, even when they were with us,-that is, they were not of the number of children, even when they were in the faith of children; because they who are truly children are foreknown and predestinated as conformed to the image of His Son, and are called according to His purpose, so as to be elected.

The phrase \"it is not lawful\" is, we think, used by the apostle instead of \"it is not possible; \"as also is the case in the passage where he says, \"All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me; but all things edify not.\"[fn-66-P6629_1337604:112-nf] For those things which are in our power because we may have them, he says are lawful for us. But the Paraclete, who is called the Holy Spirit, is so called from His work of consolation, paraclesis being termed in Latin consolatio. For if any one has deserved to participate in the Holy Spirit by the knowledge of His ineffable mysteries, he undoubtedly obtains comfort and joy of heart. For since he comes by the teaching of the Spirit to the knowledge of the reasons of all things which happen-how or why they occur-his soul can in no respect be troubled, or admit any feeling of sorrow; nor is he alarmed by anything, since, clinging to the Word of God and His wisdom, he through the Holy Spirit calls Jesus Lord. And since we have made mention of the Paraclete, and have explained as we were able what sentiments ought to be entertained regarding Him; and since our Saviour also is called the Paraclete in the Epistle of John, when he says, \"If any of us sin, we have a Paraclete with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and He is the propitiation for our sins; \"[fn-66-P6630_1338697:113-nf] let us consider whether this term Paraclete should happen to have one meaning when applied to the Saviour, and another when applied to the Holy Spirit. Now Paraclete, when spoken of the Saviour, seems to mean intercessor. For in Greek, Paraclete has both significations-that of intercessor and comforter. On account, then, of the phrase which follows, when he says, \"And He is the propitiation for our sins,\" the name Paraclete seems to be understood in the case of our Saviour as meaning intercessor; for He is said to intercede with the Father because of our sins. In the case of the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete must be understood in the sense of comforter, inasmuch as He bestows consolation upon the souls to whom He openly reveals the apprehension of spiritual knowledge.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_44_a_treatise_on_the_gift_of_perseverance_being_the_second_book","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"114","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Let the inquirer still go on, and say, \"Why is it that to some who have in good faith\nworshipped Him He has not given to persevere to the end?\" Why except because he does not speak\nfalsely who says, \"They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us,\ndoubtless they would have continued with us.\"[fn-70-P7031_2682555:36-nf] Are there, then, two natures of men?

Let no one, however, suppose that by this we affirm that some portion of the divinity of the Son of God was in Christ, and that the remaining portion was elsewhere or everywhere, which may be the opinion of those who are ignorant of the nature of an incorporeal and invisible essence. For it is impossible to speak of the parts of an incorporeal being, or to make any division of them; but He is in all things, and through all things, and above all things, in the manner in which we have spoken above, i.e., in the manner in which He is understood to be either \"wisdom,\" or the \"word,\" or the \"life,\" or the \"truth,\" by which method of understanding all confinement of a local kind is undoubtedly excluded. The Son of God, then, desiring for the salvation of the human race to appear unto men, and to sojourn among them, assumed not only a human body, as some suppose, but also a soul resembling our souls indeed in nature, but in will and power[fn-73-P7372_1691350:33-nf] resembling Himself, and such as might unfailingly accomplish all the desires and arrangements of the \"word\" and \"wisdom.\" Now, that He had a soul,[fn-73-P7373_1691542:34-nf] is most clearly shown by the Saviour in the Gospels, when He said, \"No man taketh my life from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it again.\"[fn-73-P7374_1691753:35-nf] And again, \"My soul is sorrowful even unto death.\"[fn-73-P7375_1691821:36-nf] And again, \"Now is my soul troubled.\"[fn-73-P7376_1691880:37-nf] For the \"Word\" of God is not to be understood to be a \"sorrowful and troubled\" soul, because with the authority of divinity He says, \"I have power to lay down my life.\" Nor yet do we assert that the Son of God was in that soul as he was in the soul of Paul or Peter and the other saints, in whom Christ is believed to speak as He does in Paul.

Of which soul, seeing it had received into itself the whole wisdom of God, and the truth, and the life, I think that the apostle also said this: \"Our life is hidden with Christ in God; but when Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall we also appear with him in glory.\"[fn-73-P7379_1693282:40-nf] For what other Christ can be here understood, who is said to be hidden in God, and who is afterwards to appear, except Him who is related to have been anointed with the oil of gladness, i.e., to have been filled with God essentially,[fn-73-P7380_1693541:41-nf] in whom he is now said to be hidden? For on this account is Christ proposed as an example to all believers, because as He always, even before he knew evil at all, selected the good, and loved righteousness, and hated iniquity, and therefore God anointed Him with the oil of gladness; so also ought each one, after a lapse or sin, to cleanse himself from his stains, making Him his example, and, taking Him as the guide of his journey, enter upon the steep way of virtue, that so perchance by this means, as far as possible we may, by imitating Him, be made partakers of the divine nature. according to the words of Scripture: \"He that saith that he believeth in Christ, ought so to walk, as He also walked.\"[fn-73-P7381_1694271:42-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_39_book_iii_","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"14","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"4.

Not that I am going to speak for a long time, do I say this; for behold, the lesson is now coming to an end: but lest haply of weariness we should hear Jess attentively than we ought that which is most necessary.-\"He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is no scandal,\" or \"none occasion of stumbling, in him.\" Who are they that take scandal or make scandal? They that are offended in Christ, and in the Church. They that are offended in Christ, are as if burnt by the sun, those in the Church as by the moon. But the Psalm saith, \"The sun shall not burn thee by day, neither the moon by night:[fn-40-P4030_2215152:62-nf] i.e., if thou hold fast charity, neither in Christ shall thou have occasion of falling, nor in the Church; neither Christ shall thou forsake, nor the Church. For he that forsakes the Church, how is he in Christ who is not in the members of Christ? How is he in Christ who is not in the body of Christ? Those therefore take scandal, or, occasion of failing, who forsake Christ or the Church. Whence do we understand that the Psalm in saying, \"By day shall the sun not burn thee, nor the moon by night,\" saith it of this, that the burning means scandal, or occasion of stumbling? In the first place mark the similitude itself. Just as the person whom something is burning saith, I cannot bear it, I cannot away with it, and draws back; so those persons who cannot bear some things in the Church, and withdraw themselves either from the name of Christ or from the Church, are taking scandal. For see how those took scandal as from the sun, those carnal ones to whom Christ preached of His flesh, saying, \"He that eateth not the flesh of the Son of Man and drinketh His blood, shall have no life in him.\"[fn-40-P4031_2216272:63-nf] Some seventy persons[fn-40-P4032_2216314:64-nf] said, \"Thisis an hard saying,\" and went back from Him, and there remained the twelve. All those the sun burnt, and they went back, not being able to bear the force of the Word. There remained therefore the twelve. And lest haply men should imagine that they confer a benefit upon Christ by believing on Christ, and not that the benefit is conferred by Him upon them; when the twelve were left, the Lord said to them, \"Will ye also go?\" That ye may know that I am necessary to you, not ye to me. But those whom the sun had not burnt, answered by the voice of Peter: \"Lord, Thou hast the word[fn-40-P4033_2217969:65-nf] of eternal life; whither shall we go?\" But who are they that the Church as the moon burneth by night? They that have made schisms. Hear the very word used in the apostle: \"Who is offended, and I burn not?\"[fn-40-P4034_2218188:66-nf] In what sense then is it, that there is no scandal or occasion of stumbling in him that loveth his brother? Because he that loveth his brother, beareth all things for unity's sake; because it is in the unity of charity that brotherly love exists. Some one, I know not who, offendeth thee: whether it be a bad man, or as thou supposest a bad man, or as thou pretendest a bad man: and dost thou desert so many good men? What sort of brotherly love is that which hath appeared in these[fn-40-P4035_2218691:67-nf] persons? While they accuse the Africans, they have deserted the whole world! What, were there no saints in the whole world? Or was it possible they should be condemned by you unheard? But oh! if ye loved your brethren, there would be none occasion of stumbling in you. Hear thou the Psalm, what it saith: \"Great peace have they that love Thy law, and there is to them none occasion of stumbling.\"[fn-40-P4036_2219104:68-nf] Great peace it saith there is for them that love the law of God, and that is why there is to them none occasion of stumbling. Those then who take scandal, or, occasion of stumbling, destroy peace. And of whom saith he that they take not and make not occasion of stumbling? They that love God's law. Consequently they are in charity. But some man will say, \"He said it of them that love God's law, not of the brethren.\" Hear thou what the Lord saith: \"A new commandment give I unto you that ye love one another.\"[fn-40-P4037_2219636:69-nf] What is the Law but commandment? Moreover, how is it they do not take occasion of stumbling, but because they forbear one another? As Paul saith, \"Forbearing one another in love, studying to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.\"[fn-40-P4038_2219900:70-nf] And to show that this is the law of Christ, hear the same apostle commending this very law. \"Bear ye one another's burdens,\" saith he, \"and so shall ye fulfill the law of Christ.\"[fn-40-P4039_2220100:71-nf] ","title":"Homily I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_132_homily_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"16","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"13. \"For he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth.\"[fn-40-P4041_2220229:72-nf] A great thing, my brethren: mark it, we beseech you. \"He that hateth his brother walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because the darkness hath blinded his eyes.\" What so blind as these who hate their brethren? For that ye may know that they are blind, they have stumbled at a Mountain. I say the same things often, that they may not slip out of your memory. The Stone which was \"cut out of the Mountain without hands,\" is it not Christ, who came of the kingdom of the Jews, without the work of man?[fn-40-P4042_2220767:73-nf] Has not that Stone broken in pieces all the kingdoms of the earth, that is, all the dominations of idols and demons? Has not that Stone grown, and become a great mountain, and filled the whole earth? Do we point with the finger to this Mountain in like manner as the moon on its third day[fn-40-P4043_2221104:74-nf] is pointed out to men? For example, when they wish people to see the new moon, they say, Lo, the moon! lo, where it is! and if there be some there who are not sharp-sighted, and say, Where then the finger is put forth that they may see it. Sometimes when they are ashamed to be thought blind, they say they have seen what they have not seen. Do we in this way point out the Church, my brethren? Is it not open? Is it not manifest? Has it not possessed all nations? Is not that fulfilled which so many .years before was promised to Abraham, that in his seed should all nations be blessed?[fn-40-P4044_2222027:75-nf] It was promised to one believer, and the world is filled with thousands of believers. Behold here the mountain filling the whole face of the earth! Behold the city of which it is said, \"A city set upon a mountain cannot be hid!\"[fn-40-P4045_2222276:76-nf] But those stumble at the mountain, and when it is said to them, Go up; \"There is no mountain,\" say they, and dash their heads against it sooner than seek a habitation there. Esaias was read yesterday; whosoever of you was awake not with his eyes only but with his ear, and not the ear of the body but the ear of the heart, noted this; \"In the last days shall the mountain of the house of the Lord be manifest, prepared upon the top of the mountains.\"[fn-40-P4046_2222745:77-nf] What so manifest as a mountain? But there are even mountains unknown, because they are situated in one part of the earth. Which of you knows Mount Olympus? Just as the people who dwell there do not know our Giddaba. These mountains are in different parts of the earth. But not so that Mountain, for it hath filled the whole face of the earth, and of it is said, \"Prepared upon the top of the mountains.\" It is a Mountain above the tops of all mountains. \"And,\" saith he, \"to it shall be gathered all nations.\" Who can fail to be aware of this Mountain? Who breaks his head by stumbling against it? Who is ignorant of the city set upon a mountain? But marvel not that it is unknown by these who hate the brethren, because they walk in darkness and know not whither they go, because the darkness hath blinded their eyes. They do not see the Mountain: I would not have thee marvel; they have no eyes. How is it they have no eyes? Because the darkness hath blinded them. How do we prove this? Because they hate the brethren, in that, while they are offended at Africans, they separate themselves from the whole earth: in that they do not tolerate for the peace of Christ those whom they defame, and do tolerate for the sake of Donatus[fn-40-P4047_2223992:78-nf] those whom they condemn.","title":"Homily I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_133_homily_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"4. \"I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you through His name.\"[fn-40-P4073_2237016:16-nf] Therefore, \"little children,\"[fn-40-P4074_2237066:17-nf] because in forgiveness of sins ye have your birth.

These three there are, and thou canst find nothing whereby human cupidity can be tempted, but either by the lust of the flesh, or the lust of the eyes, or the pride of life. By these three was the Lord tempted of the devil.[fn-41-P4128_2256054:61-nf] By the lust of the flesh He was tempted when it was said to Him, \"If thou be the Son of God, speak to these stones that they become bread,\" when He hungered after His fast. But in what way repelled He the tempter, and taught his soldier how to fight? Mark what He said to him: \"Not by bread alone doth man live, but by every word of God.\" He was tempted also by the lust of the eyes concerning a miracle, when he said to Him, \"Cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.\" He resisted the tempter, for to do the miracle, would only have been to seem either to have yielded, or to have done it from curiosity; for He wrought when He would, as God, howbeit as healing the weak. For if He had done it then, He might have been thought to wish only to do a miracle. But lest men should think this, mark what He answered; and when the like temptation shall happen to thee, say thou also the same: \"Get thee behind me, Satan; for it is written, Thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God:\" that is, if I do this I shall tempt God. He said what He would have thee to say. When the enemy suggests to thee, \"What sort of man, what sort of Christian, art thou? As yet hast thou done one miracle, or by thy prayers have the dead been raised, or hast thou healed the fevered? if thou wert truly of any moment, thou wouldest do some miracle:\" answer and say: \"It is written, Thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God:\" therefore I will not tempt God, as if I should belong to God if I do a miracle, and not belong if I do none: and what becomes then of His words, \"Rejoice, because your names are written in heaven\"? By \"pride of life\" how was the Lord tempted? When he carried Him up to an high place, and said to Him, \"All these will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.\" By the loftiness of an earthly kingdom he wished to tempt the King of all worlds: but the Lord who made heaven and earth trod the devil under foot. What great matter for the devil to be conquered by the Lord? Then what did He in the answer He made to the devil but teach thee the answer He would have thee to make? \"It is, written, Thou shall worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shall thou serve.\" Holding these things fast, ye shall not have the concupiscence of the world: by not having concupiscence of the world, neither shall the lust of the flesh, nor the lust of the eyes, nor the pride of life, subjugate you: and ye shall make place for Charity when she cometh, that ye may love God.

As regards our reverend friend Epiphanius, this is strange shuffling of yours, when you say that it was impossible for him to have written against you after his giving you the kiss and joining with you in prayer. It is as if you were to contend that he would not be dead if a short time before he had been alive, or as if it were not equally certain that he had first reproved you and then, after the kiss of peace, excommunicated you. \"They went out from us,\" it is said,[fn-94-P9473_2631344:39-nf] \"but they were not of us; otherwise they would no doubt have continued with us.\" The apostle bids us avoid a heretic after first and second admonition: of course this implies that he was a member of the flock of the church before he was avoided or condemned. I confess I cannot restrain my laughter when, at the prompting of some clever person, you strike up a hymn in honour of Epiphanius. Why, this is the `silly old man,' the `anthropomorphite,' this is the man who boasted in your presence of the six thousand books of Origen that he had read, who `thinks himself entrusted with the preaching of the Gospel against Origen among all nations in their own tongue' who `will not let others read Origen for fear they should discover what he has stolen from him.' Read what he has written, and the letter, or rather letters, one of which I will adduce as a testimonial to your orthodoxy, so that it may be seen how worthy he is of your present praise.[fn-94-P9474_2632314:40-nf] \"May God set you free, my brother, and the holy people of Christ which is entrusted to you, and all the brethren who are with you, and especially the Presbyter Rufinus, from the heresy of Origen, and all other heresies, and from the perdition which they bring.

He stands forth as the enemy of God and of the church.\" This is the testimony which this saintly man bears to you. This is the garland of praise which he gives you to parade in. Thus runs the letter which your golden coins extracted from the chamber of our brother Eusebius, so that you might calumniate the translator of it, and might fix upon me the guilt of a most manifest crime-that of rendering a Greek word as `dearest' which ought to have been `honourable!' But what is all this to you who can control all events by your prudent methods, and can trim your path between different possibilities, first saying, if you can find any one to believe you, that neither Anastasius nor Epiphanius ever wrote a line against you; and, secondly, when their actual letters cry out against you, and break down your audacious effrontery, despising the judgment of them both, and say it does not matter to you whether they wrote or not, since it was impossible for them to write against an innocent and an absent man.","title":"Book III.","author":"Rufinus"},{"chapter":2,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_134_homily_iii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"6. \"I write unto you not because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.\"[fn-41-P4162_2273477:20-nf] Behold, we are admonished how we may know antichrist.

Once more we come back to the difficulty of the question. Ask them one by one; they confess that Jesus is the Christ. The difficulty that hampers us comes of our taking what is said in the Epistle in too narrow a sense. At any rate ye see the question; this question puts both us and them to a stand, if it be not understood. Either we are antichrists, or they are antichrists; they call us antichrists, and say that we went out from them; we say the like of them. But now this epistle has marked out the antichrists by this cognizance: \"Whosoever denies that Jesus is the Christ,\" that same \"is an antichrist.\" Now therefore let us enquire who denies; and let us mark not the tongue, but the deeds. For if all be asked, all with one mouth confess that Jesus is the Christ. Let the tongue keep still for a little while, ask the life. If we shall find this, if the Scripture itself shall tell us that denial is a thing done not only with the tongue, but also with the deeds, then assuredly we find many antichrists, who with the mouth profess Christ, and in their manners dissent from Christ.

And with what face wilt thou go hence to Him that abideth for ever? \"But a powerful man threatens me, so that I must do some evil.\" What does he threaten? Prisons, chains, fires, torments, wild beasts: aye, but not eternal fire? Dread that which One Almighty threatens; love that which One Almighty promises; and all the world becomes vile in our regard, whether it promise or terrify. \"These things have I written unto you concerning them which seduce you; that ye may know that ye have an unction, and the unction which we have received from Him may abide in you.\"[fn-41-P4194_2288560:46-nf] In the unction we have the sacramental sign [of a thing unseen], the virtue itself is invisible;[fn-41-P4195_2288987:47-nf] the invisible unction is the Holy Ghost; the invisible unction is that charity, which, in whomsoever it be, shall be as a root to him: however burning the sun, he cannot wither.

If \"His unction teacheth you concerning all things,\" it seems we labor without a cause. And what mean we, to cry out as we do? Let us leave you to His unction, and let His unction teach you. But this is putting the question only to myself: I put it also to that same apostle: let him deign to hear a babe that asks of him: to John himself I say, Had those the unction to whom thou wast speaking? Thou hast said, \"His unction teachethyou concerning all things.\" To what purpose hast thou written an Epistle like this? what teaching didst \"thou \"give them? what instruction? what edification? See here now, brethren, see a mighty mystery.[fn-41-P4199_2290572:50-nf] The sound of our words strikes the ears, the Master is within. Do not suppose that any man learns ought from man. We can admonish by the sound of our voice; if there be not One within that shall teach, vain is the noise we make. Aye, brethren, have yea mind to know it? Have ye not all heard this present discourse? and yet how many will go from this place untaught! I, for my part, have spoken to all; but they to whom that Unction within speaketh not, they whom the Holy Ghost within teacheth not, those go back untaught. The teachings of the master from without are a sort of aids and admonitions. He that teacheth the hearts, hath His chair in heaven. Therefore saith He also Himself in the Gospel: \"Call no man your master upon earth; One is your Master, even Christ.\"[fn-42-P4200_2291591:51-nf] Let Him therefore Himself speak to you within, when not one of mankind is there: for though there be some one at thy side, there is none in thine heart.

There is then, I say, a Master within that teacheth: Christ teacheth; His inspiration teacheth. Where His inspiration and His unction is not, in vain do words make a noise from without. So are the words, brethren, which we speak from without, as is the husbandman to the tree: from without he worketh, applieth water and diligence of culture; let him from without apply what he will, does he form the apples? does he clothe the nakedness of thewood with a shady covering of leaves? does he do any thing like this from within? But whose doing is this? Hear the husbandman, the apostle: both see what we are, and hear the Master within: \"I have planted, Apollos haft watered; but God gave the increase: neither he that planteth is any thing, neither he that watereth, but He that giveth the increase, even God.\"[fn-42-P4202_2293185:53-nf] This then we say to you: whether we plant, or whether we water, by speaking we are not any thing; but He that giveth the increase, even God: that is, \"His unction which teacheth you concerning all things.\"","title":"Homily III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":29,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_135_homily_iv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"3. \"If ye know that He is righteous, know ye[fn-42-P4220_2298877:9-nf] that every one that doeth righteousness is born of Him.\"[fn-42-P4221_2299158:10-nf] The righteousness which at present is ours is of faith. Perfect righteousness is not, save only in the angels: and scarce in angels, if they be compared with God: yet if there be any perfect righteousness of souls and spirits which God hath created, it is in the angels, holy, just, good, by no lapse turned aside, by no pride falling, but remaining ever in the contemplation of the Word of God, and having nothing else sweet unto them save Him by whom they were created; in them is perfect righteousness: but in us it has begun to be, of faith, by the Spirit. Ye heard when the Psalm was read,\"Begin[fn-42-P4222_2299779:11-nf] to the Lord in confession.\"[fn-42-P4223_2299857:12-nf] \"Begin,\" saith it; the beginning of our righteousness is the confession of sins.

At present we are still fighting: if we fight we are in the lists;[fn-42-P4225_2300466:14-nf] we smite and are smitten; but who shall conquer, remains to be seen. And that man conquers, who even when he smites presumes not on his own strength, but relies upon God that cheers him on. The devil is alone when he fights against us. If we are with God, we overcome the devil: for if thou fight alone with the devil, thou wilt be overcome. He is a skillful enemy: how may palms has he won! Consider to what he has cast us down t That we are born mortal, comes of this, that he in the first place cast down from Paradise our very original. What then is to be done, seeing he is so well practised? Let the Almighty be invoked to thine aid against the devices of the devil. Let Him dwell in thee, who cannot be overcome, and thou shalt securely overcome him who is wont to overcome. But to overcome whom? Those in whom God dwelleth not. For, that ye may know it, brethren; Adam being in Paradise despised the commandment of God, and lifted up the neck, as if he desired to be his own master, and were loath to be subject to the will of God: so he fell from that immortality, from that blessedness. But there was a certain man, a man now well skilled, though a mortal born, who even as he sat on the dunghill, purifying with worms, overcame the devil: yea, Adam himself then overcame: even he, in Job; because Job was of his race. So then, Adam, overcome in Paradise, overcame on the dunghill. Being in Paradise, he gave ear to the persuasion of the woman which the devil had put into her: but being on the dunghill he said to Eve, \"Thou hast spoken as one of the foolish women.\"[fn-42-P4226_2302058:15-nf] There he lent an ear, here he gave an answer: when he was glad, he listened, when he was scourged, he overcame. Therefore, see what follows, my brethren, in the Epistle: because this is what it would have us lay to heart, that we may overcome the devil indeed, but not of ourselves. \"If ye know that He is righteous,\" saith it, \"know ye that every one that doeth righteousness is born of Him:\" of God, of Christ. And in that he hath said, \"Is born of Him,\" he cheers us on.

This, if ye remember, we gave you to understand in beginning to read this Epistle, that nothing in it is so commended as charity. Even if it seems to speak of various other things, to this it makes its way back, and whatever it says, it will needs bring all to bear upon charity. Let us see whether it does so here. Mark: \"Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin.\" We ask, what sin? because if thou understand all sin, it will be contrary to that place, \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\" Then let him say what sin; let him teach us; lest haply I may have rashly said that the sin here is the violation of charity, because he said above, \"He that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because the darkness hath blinded his eyes.\"[fn-43-P4309_2338722:24-nf] But perhaps he has said something in what comes afterwards, and has mentioned charity by name? See that this circuit of words hath this end, hath this issue. \"Whosoever is born of God, sinneth not, because His seed remaineth in him.\"[fn-43-P4310_2338976:25-nf] The \"seed\" of God, i.e. the word of God: whence the apostle saith, \"I have begotten you through the Gospel. And he cannot sin, because he is born of God.\"[fn-43-P4311_2339151:26-nf] Let him tell us this, let us see in what we cannot sin. \"In this are manifested the children of God and the children of the devil. Whosoever is not righteous is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.\"[fn-43-P4312_2339385:27-nf] Aye, now indeed it is manifest of what he speaks: \"Neither he that loveth not his brother.\" Therefore, love alone puts the difference between the children of God and the children of the devil. Let them all sign themselves with the sign of the cross of Christ; let them all respond, Amen; let all sing Alleluia; let all be baptized, let all come to church, let all build the walls of churches: there is no discerning of the children of God from the children of the devil, but only by charity. They that have charity are born of God: they that have it not, are not born of God. A mighty token, a mighty distinction! Have what thou wilt; if this alone thou have not, it profiteth thee nothing: other things if thou have not, have this, and thou hast fulfilled the law. \"For he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law,\" saith the apostle: and, \"Charity is the fulfilling of the law.\"[fn-43-P4313_2340289:28-nf] I take this to be the pearl which the merchant man in the Gospel is described to have been seeking, who \"found one pearl, and sold all that he had, and bought it.\"[fn-43-P4314_2340477:29-nf] This is the pearl of price, Charity, without which whatever thou mayest have, profiteth thee nothing: which if alone thou have, it sufficeth thee.

But wherein must we exercise ourselves? In brotherly love. Thou mayest say to me, I have not seen God: canst thou say to me, I have not seen man? Love thy brother.

The Apostle Paul also speaks of certain men who had erred concerning the truth, and were overthrowing the faith of some; whose word was eating as a canker. Yet in saying that they should be avoided, he nevertheless intimates that they were all in one great house, but as vessels to dishonor,-I suppose because they had not as yet gone out. Or if they had already gone out, how can he say that they were in the same great house with the honorable vessels, unless it was in virtue of the sacraments themselves, which even in the severed meetings of heretics are not changed, that he speaks of all as belonging to the same great house, though in different degrees of esteem, some to honor and some to dishonor? For thus he speaks in his Epistle to Timothy: \"But shun profane and vain babblings; for they will increase unto more ungodliness. And their word will eat as doth a canker; of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some. Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth firm, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are His. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, andsome to dishonor.

What hindrance does this offer to the knowledge of God? Why should it not rather be an assistance, and a means by which one might be better able to arrive at the truth? \"Truly it is no evil to have been educated, for education is the way to virtue; but to rank those amongst the number of the educated who hold erroneous opinions is what even the wise men among the Greeks would not do.

But those also who, though seeming to be within, are yet of such a kind, not only are without spiritually, but will in the end be separated in the body also. For all such are for nothing. But it does not therefore follow that the sacrament of baptism which is in them is nothing. For even in the very men who are cast out, if they return to their senses and come back, the salvation which had departed from them returns; but the baptism does not return, because it never had departed. And in what the Lord says, \"Go therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,\" He did not permit any to baptize except the good, inasmuch as He did not say to the bad, \"Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained.\"[fn-39-P3943_2148632:52-nf] How then do the wicked baptize within, who cannot remit sins?

Yet the baptism Of Christ should be acknowledged in both, and held invalid in none, whether before they are converted, though then it profit them nothing, or after they are converted, that so it may profit them, as he says, \"Since they themselves, by withdrawing when they have lost their savor from the Church, which is one, have become contrary to it, let that be done which is written, `The houses of those that are opposed to the law must need be cleansed.' And it therefore follows,\" he goes on to say, \"that those who have been polluted by being baptized by men opposed to Christ should first be cleansed, and only then baptized.\" What then? Are thieves and murderers not contrary to the law, which says, \"Thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not steal?\"[fn-39-P3945_2150028:54-nf] \"They must therefore needs be cleansed.\" Who will deny it?

But if they do neither the one nor the other, they are themselves too plainly the sport of every wind and surge, and are influenced by opinions, not their own, but of others, and being such, are as little worthy of deference now as before, in what they allege.

Doubtless, they desire that doctrines which have been judged wrong and have been reprobated should gain the ascendancy, and they make violent efforts to prejudice what was rightly defined. Nor should there be any reason on our part for any further explanation, or answer to their excuses, neither on theirs for further resistance, but for an acquiescence in what the leaders of their heresy subscribed; for though the subsequent change of Eusebius and his fellows was suspicious and immoral, their subscription, when they had the opportunity of at least some little defence of themselves, is a certain proof of the irreligion of their doctrine. For they would not have subscribed previously had they not condemned the heresy, nor would they have condemned it, had they not been encompassed with difficulty and shame; so that to change back again is a proof of their contentious zeal for irreligion.

Augustin answered: I seemed too a little while ago, when we were disputing about the oil of the sinner, to anoint your forehead, in order that you might say, if you dared, whether you yourself were not a sinner. You have had the hardihood to say as much. What a portentous sin! For in that you assert yourself to be a priest, what else have you maintained by quoting this testimony of the prophet, save that you are wholly without sin? For if you have sin, who is there that shall pray for you, according to your understanding of the words? For thus you blazon yourselves among the wretched people, quoting from the prophet: \"If the people shall sin, the priest shall pray for them: but if the priest shall sin, who will pray for him?[fn-54-P5499_2661755:334-nf] to the intent that they may believe you to be without sin, and entrust the wiping away their sins to your prayers. Truly ye are great men, exalted above your fellows, heavenly, godlike, angels indeed rather than men, who pray for the people, and will not have the people pray for you! Are you more righteous than Paul, more perfect than that great apostle, who was wont to commend himself to the prayers of those whom he taught? \"Continue,\" he says, \"in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving; withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds; that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.\"[fn-55-P5500_2662496:335-nf] See how prayer is made for an apostle, which you would have not made for a bishop. Do you perceive of how devilish a nature your pride is? Prayer is made for an apostle, that he may make manifest the mystery of Christ as he ought to speak. Accordingly, if you had a pious people under you, you ought to have exhorted them to pray for you, that you might not give utterance as you ought not. Are you more righteous than the evangelist John, who says, \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us?\"[fn-55-P5501_2663050:336-nf] Finally, are you more righteous than Daniel, whom you yourself quoted in this very epistle, going so far as to say, \"The most righteous king cast forth Daniel, as he supposed, to be devoured by wild beasts?\"-a thing which he never did suppose, since he said to Daniel himself, in the most friendly spirit, as the context of the lesson shows, \"Thy God, whom thou servest continually, He will deliver thee.\"[fn-55-P5502_2663476:337-nf] But on this subject we have already said much. With regard to the question now before us, viz., that Daniel was most righteous, it is proved not by your testimony, though that might be sufficient for me in the argument which I hold with you, but by the testimony of the Spirit of God, speaking also by the mouth of Ezekiel, where he named three men of most eminent righteousness, Noah, Daniel, and Job, who, he said, were the only men that could be saved from a certain excessive wrath of God, which was hanging over all the rest.[fn-55-P5503_2664027:338-nf] A man, therefore, of the highest righteousness, one of three conspicuous for righteousness, prays, and says, \"While I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin, and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God.\"[fn-55-P5504_2664306:339-nf] And you say that you are without sin, because forsooth you are a priest; and if the people sin, you pray for them: but if you sin, who shall pray for you? For clearly by the impiety of such arrogance you show yourself to be unworthy of the mediation of that Priest whom the prophet would have to be understood in these words, which you do not understand. For now that no one may ask why this was said, I will explain it so far as by God's grace I shall be able. God was preparing the minds of men, by His prophet, to desire a Priest of such a sort that none should pray for Him. He was Himself prefigured in the times of the first people and the first temple, in which all things were figures for our ensample. Therefore the high priest used to enter alone into the holy of holies, that he might make supplication for the people, which did not enter with the priest into that inner sanctuary;[fn-55-P5505_2665220:340-nf] just as our High Priest is entered into the secret places of the heavens, into that truer holy of holies, whilst we for whom He prays are still placed here.[fn-55-P5506_2665407:341-nf] It is with this reference that the prophet says, \"If the people shall sin, the priest shall pray for them: but if the priest shall sin, who will pray for him?\" Seek therefore a priest of such a kind that he cannot sin, nor need that one should pray for him. And for this reason prayer is made for the apostles by the people;[fn-55-P5507_2665762:342-nf] but for that Priest who is the Master and Lord of the apostles is prayer not made. Hear John confessing this, and saying, \"My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not.

In order then that we may be able well to do and to fulfil what we have been admonished of to-day, let us first persuade ourselves to this, above all things to have no hate. For when there is no beam in thine own eye, thou seest rightly whatever may be in thy brother's eye; and art uneasy, till thou cast out of thy brother's eye what thou seest to hurt it. The light that is in thee, doth not allow thee to neglect thy brother's light. Whereas if thou hate, and wouldest correct him, how dost thou improve his light, when thou hast lost thine own light? For the same Scripture, where it is written, \"Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer,\" hath expressly told us this also. \"He that hateth his brother is in darkness even until now.\"[fn-44-P4443_1887442:3-nf] Hatred then is darkness. Now it cannot but be, that he who hateth another, should first injure himself. For him he endeavours to hurt outwardly, he lays himself waste inwardly. Now in proportion as our soul is of more value than our body, so much the more ought we to provide for it, that it be not hurt. But he that hateth another, doth hurt his own soul. And what would he do to him whom he hateth? What would he do? He takes away his money, can he take his faith away? he wounds his good fame, can he wound his conscience? Whatever injury he does, is but external; now observe what his injury to himself is? For he who hateth another is an enemy to himself within. But because he is not sensible of what harm he is doing to himself, he is violent against another, and that the more dangerously. that he is not sensible of the evil he is doing to himself; because by this very violence he has lost the power of perception. Thou art violent against thine enemy; by this violence of thine he is spoiled, and thou art wicked. Great is the difference between the two. He hath lost his money, thou thine innocence. Ask which hath suffered the heavier loss? He hath lost a thing that was sure to perish, and thou art become one who must now perish thyself.","title":"Sermon XXXII. [LXXXII.

If He is man, how can another's body speak in his heart? If God, then Christ is not a man but God; for since Christ spoke in the Apostle, and only God could speak in him, therefore a Divine Christ spoke in him. And so you see that there is nothing to be said here, that no division or separation can be made between Christ and God: because complete Divinity was in Christ, and Christ was completely in God. No division or severing of the two can here be admitted. There is only one simple, pious, and sound confession to be made; viz., to adore, love, and worship Christ as God. But do you want to understand more fully and thoroughly that there is no separation to be made between God and Christ, and that we must hold that God is altogether one with Christ? Hear what the Apostle says to the Corinthians: \"For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive the proper things of the body, according as he hath done, whether it be good or evil.\"[fn-70-P7015_2541517:14-nf] But in another passage, in writing to the Romans he says: \"We shall all stand before the judgment seat of God: for it is written: As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.\"[fn-70-P7016_2541766:15-nf] You see then that the judgment seat of God is the same as that of Christ; understand then without any doubt that Christ is God; and when you see that the substance of God and Christ is altogether inseparable, admit also that the Person cannot be severed. Unless forsooth because the Apostle in one Epistle said that we should be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, and in another before that of God, you invent two judgment seats, and fancy that some will be judged by Christ and others by God. But this is foolish and wild, and madder than a madman's utterances. Acknowledge then the Lord of all, the God of the universe, acknowledge the judgment seat of God in the judgment seat of Christ. Love life, love your salvation, love Him by whom you were created. Fear Him by whom you are to be judged. For whether you will or no, you have to be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, and laying aside wicked blasphemy and the childish talk of unbelieving words, though you think that the judgment seat of God is different from that of Christ, you will come before the judgment seat of Christ, and will find by evidence that there is no gainsaying, that the judgment seat of God is indeed the same as that of Christ, and that in Christ the Son of God, there is all the glory of God the Son, and the power of God the Father. \"For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son, that all men may honour the Son as they honour the Father.\"[fn-70-P7017_2543264:16-nf] For whoever denies the Father denies the Son also. \"Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that confesseth the Son, hath the Father also.\"[fn-70-P7018_2543444:17-nf] And so you should learn that the glory of the Father and the Son is inseparable, and their majesty is inseparable also and that the Son cannot be honoured without the Father, nor the Father without the Son. But no man can honour God and the Son of God except in Christ the only-begotten Son of God. For it is impossible for a man to have the Spirit of God who is to be honoured except in the Spirit of Christ, as the Apostle says: \"But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. But if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.\"[fn-70-P7019_2544055:18-nf] And again: \"Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ Jesus who died, yea rather who rose again.\"[fn-70-P7020_2544255:19-nf] You see then now, even against your will, that there is absolutely no difference between the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ, or between the judgment of God and the judgment of Christ.

Of the Glory of the Father and the Spirit there is no question. You are slandering the Son, because you say that it was not the same Person who was born of Mary, as He who was begotten of God the Father. Tell me then: if you do not deny that the only Son of God was begotten of God, whom do you make out that He is who was born of Mary?

And thus there is a fourth Person whom you introduce, and whom (though in words you term Him a mere man) you assert actually not to have been a mere man, since you allow (not however as you ought) that He is to be honoured, worshipped, and adored. Since then the Son of God who was begotten of the Father is certainly to be worshipped, and He who was conceived of Mary by the Holy Ghost is to be worshipped, you make two Persons to be honoured and venerated, whom you so far sever from each other, as to venerate each with an honour special and peculiar to Him. And thus you see that by denying and by severing from Himself the Son of God, you destroy, as far as you can, the whole mystery of the divinity.

But what is this, \"He shall go in and out, and find pasture\"? To enter indeed into the Church by Christ the door, is eminently good; but to go out of the Church, as this same John the evangelist saith in his epistle, \"They went out from us, but they were not of us,\"[fn-19-P1959_1221315:28-nf] is certainly otherwise than good. Such a going out could not then be commended by the good Shepherd, when He said, \"And he shall go in and out, and find pasture.\" There is therefore not only some sort of entrance, but some outgoing also that is good, by the good door, which is Christ. But what is that praiseworthy and blessed outgoing? I might say, indeed, that we enter when we engage in some inward exercise of thought; and go out, when we take to some active work without: and since, as the apostle saith, Christ dwelleth in our hearts by faith,[fn-19-P1960_1221887:29-nf] to enter by Christ is to give ourselves to thought in accordance with that faith; but to go out by Christ is, in accordance also with that same faith, to take to outside works, that is to say, in the presence of others. Hence, also, we read in a psalm, \"Man goeth forth to his work;\"[fn-19-P1961_1222191:30-nf] and the Lord Himself saith, \"Let your works shine before men.\"[fn-19-P1962_1222273:31-nf] But I am better pleased that the Truth Himself, like a good Shepherd, and therefore a good Teacher, hath in a certain measure reminded us how we ought to understand His words, \"He shall go in and out, and find pasture,\" when He added in the sequel, \"The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.\" For He seems to me to have meant, That they may have life in coming in, and have it more abundantly at their departure. For no one can pass out by the door-that is, by Christ-to that eternal life which shall be open to the sight, unless by the same door-that is, by the same Christ-he has entered His church, which is His fold, to the temporal life, which is lived in faith. Therefore, He saith, \"I am come that they may have life,\" that is, faith, which worketh by love;[fn-19-P1963_1223165:32-nf] by which faith they enter the fold that they may live, for the just liveth by faith:[fn-19-P1964_1223268:33-nf] \"and that they may have it more abundantly,\" who, enduring unto the end, pass out by this same door, that is, by the faith of Christ; for as true believers they die, and will have life more abundantly when they come whither the Shepherd hath preceded them, where they shall die no more. Although, therefore, there is no want of pasture even here in the fold,-for we may understand the words \"and shall find pasture\" as referring to both, that is, both to their going in and their going out,-yet there only will they find the true pasture. where they shall be filled who hunger and thirst after righteousness,[fn-19-P1965_1223893:34-nf] -such pasture as was found by him to whom it was said, \"To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.\"[fn-19-P1966_1224009:35-nf] But how He Himself is the door, and Himself the Shepherd, so that He also may in a certain respect be understood as going in and out by Himself, and who is the porter, it would be too long to inquire to-day, and, according to the grace given us by Himself, to unfold in the way of dissertation.

Behold another lofty degree of your glory; behold, with confession, a double title to deserving well of God,-to stand with a firm step, and to drive away in this struggle, by the strength of your faith, those who endeavour to make a breach in the Gospel, and bring impious hands to the work of undermining the Lord's precepts:-to have before afforded the indications of courage, and now to afford lessons of life. The Lord, when, after His resurrection, He sent forth His apostles, charges them, saying, \"All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.\"[fn-51-P5141_1561082:2-nf] And the Apostle John, remembering this charge, subsequently lays it down in his epistle: \"Hereby,\" says he, \"we do know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. He that saith he knoweth Him, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.\"[fn-51-P5142_1561378:3-nf] You prompt the keeping of these precepts; you observe the divine and heavenly commands.

I rejoice, therefore, on your behalf, most brave and faithful brethren; and as much as I congratulate the martyrs there honoured for the glory of their strength, so much do I also equally congratulate you for the crown of the Lord's discipline. The Lord has shed forth His condescension in manifold kinds of liberality. He has distributed the praises of good soldiers and their spiritual glories in plentiful variety. We also are sharers in your honour; we count your glory our glory, whose times have been brightened by such a felicity, that it should be the fortune of our day to see the proved servants of God and Christ's soldiers crowned.

But it becomes us rather to inquire what is to be understood by this serving of Christ to which there is attached so great a reward. For if we have taken up the idea that the serving of Christ is the preparation of what is needful for the body, or the cooking and serving up of food, or the mixing of drink and handing the cup to one at the supper table; this, indeed, was done to Him by those who had the privilege of His bodily presence, as in the case of Martha and Mary, when Lazarus also was one of those who sat at the table. But in that sort of way Christ was served also by the reprobate Judas; for it was he also who had the money bag; and although he had the exceeding wickedness to steal of its contents, yet it was he also who provided what was needful for the meal.[fn-22-P2245_1377494:16-nf] And so also, when our Lord said to him, \"What thou doest, do quickly,\" there were some who thought that He only gave him orders to make some needful preparations for the feast-day, or to give something to the poor.[fn-22-P2246_1378033:17-nf] In no sense, therefore, was it of this class of servants that the Lord said, \"Where I am, there shall also my servant be,\" and \"If any man serve me, him will my Father honor;\" for we see that Judas, who served in this way, became an object of reprobation rather than of honor. Why, then, go elsewhere to find out what this serving of Christ implies, and not rather see its disclosure in the words themselves? for when He said, \"If any man serve me, let him follow me,\" He wished it to be understood just as if He had said, If any man doth not follow me, he serveth me not. And those, therefore, are the servants of Jesus Christ, who seek not their own things, but the things that are Jesus Christ's.[fn-22-P2247_1378759:18-nf] For \"let him follow me\" is just this: Let him walk in my ways, and not in his own; as it is written elsewhere, \"He that saith he abideth in Christ, ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked.\"[fn-22-P2248_1378978:19-nf] For he ought, if supplying food to the hungry, to do it in the way of mercy and not of boasting, seeking therein nothing else but the doing of good, and not letting his left hand know what his right hand doeth;[fn-22-P2249_1379209:20-nf] in other words, that all thought of self-seeking should be utterly estranged from a work of charity. He that serveth in this way serveth Christ, and will have it rightly said to him, \"Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of those who are mine, ye did it unto me.\"[fn-22-P2250_1379498:21-nf] And thus doing not only those acts of mercy that pertain to the body, but every good work, for the sake of Christ (for then will all be good, because \"Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth \"[fn-22-P2251_1379747:22-nf] ), he is Christ's servant even to that work of special love, which is to lay down his life for the brethren, for that were to lay it down also for Christ. For this also will He say hereafter in behalf of His members: Inasmuch as ye did it for these, ye have done it for me. And certainly it was in reference to such a work that He was also pleased to make and to style Himself a servant, when He says, \"Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto [served], but to minister [serve], and to lay down His life for many.\"[fn-22-P2252_1380292:23-nf] Every one, therefore, is the servant of Christ in the same way as Christ also is a servant.
