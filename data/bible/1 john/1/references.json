Fleshly concupiscence claims the functions of adult age, craves after beauty's harvest, rejoices in its own shame, pleads the necessity of a husband to the female sex, as a source of authority and of comfort, or to render it safe from evil rumours. To meet these its counsels, do you apply the examples of sisters of ours whose names are with the Lord,[fn-7-P757_184600:38-nf] -who, when their husbands have preceded them (to glory), give to no opportunity of beauty or of age the precedence over holiness. They prefer to be wedded to God.To God their beauty, to God their youth (is dedicated). With Him they live; with Him they converse; Him they \"handle\"[fn-7-P758_184955:39-nf] by day and by night; to the Lord they assign their prayers as dowries; from Him, as oft as they desire it, they receive His approbation[fn-7-P759_185137:40-nf] as dotal gifts. Thus they have laid hold for themselves of an eternal gift of the Lord; and while on earth, by abstaining from marriage, are already counted as belonging to the angelic family. Training yourself to an emulation of (their) constancy by the examples of such women, you will by spiritual affection bury that fleshly concupiscence, in abolishing the temporal[fn-7-P760_185526:41-nf] and fleeting desires of beauty and youth by the compensating gain of immortal blessings.","title":"Book I.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_05_procatechesis","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"6.

For the Father speaks it, that it may be His Word: yet not as a word producing a sound proceeds from the mouth, or is thought before it is pronounced. For this word is completed in certain spaces of time, but that is eternal, and speaks to us by enlightening us, what ought to be spoken to men, both of itself and of the Father.

For in so far as it is the Word. it is not what the Father is: because the Word is not the Father, and Word is spoken relatively, as is also Son, which assuredly is not the Father. And therefore Christ is the power and wisdom of God, because He Himself, being also power and wisdom, is from the Father, who is power and wisdom; as He is light of the Father, who is light, and the fountain of life with God the Father, who is Himself assuredly the fountain of life. For \"with Thee,\" He says, \"is the fountain of life, and in Thy light shall we see light.\"[fn-11-P1184_501762:6-nf] Because, \"as the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself:\"[fn-11-P1185_501880:7-nf] and, \"He was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world:\" and this light, \"the Word,\" was \"with God;\" but \"the Word also was God;\"[fn-11-P1186_502050:8-nf] and \"God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all:\"[fn-11-P1187_502121:9-nf] but a light that is not corporeal, but spiritual; yet not in such way spiritual, that it was wrought by illumination, as it was said to the apostles, \"Ye are the light of the world,\"[fn-11-P1188_502321:10-nf] but \"the light which lighteth every man,\" that very supreme wisdom itself who is God, of whom we now treat.

Being questioned by the maid-servant, he denied Christ once; being questioned a second thee, he denied Him; being questioned a third thee, he denied Him.[fn-64-P6455_2723655:24-nf] God be thanked, that the questioning ceased; if the questioning had not ceased, long would the denial have been repeated. So then after He rose again, then He confirmed them, then did they become spiritual. Had they at that thee then no sin? The Apostles spiritual, wrote spiritual epistles, they sent them to the Churches; \"they had no sin.\" This you say. I do not believe you, I ask themselves. Tell us, O holy Apostles, after the Lord rose again, and confirmed you with the Holy Ghost sent from heaven; did ye cease to have sin? Tell us, I pray you. Let us hear, that sinners may not despair, that they may not leave off to pray to God, because they are not without sin. Tell us. One of them saith. And who? He whom the Lord loved the most, and who lay on the Lord's Breast,[fn-64-P6456_2724459:25-nf] and drank in the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven which he was to pour forth again. Him I ask; \"Have ye sin or not?\" He maketh answer and saith, \"If we shall say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\"[fn-64-P6457_2724715:26-nf] Now it is the same John who said, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\"[fn-64-P6458_2724849:27-nf] See ye what heights he had passed, that he could reach to the WordSuch an one, and so great, who like an eagle soared above the clouds, who in the serene clearness of his mind saw, \"In the beginning was the Word ;\" he hath said, \"If we shall say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. But if we shall confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\"[fn-64-P6459_2725309:28-nf] Therefore pray ye.","title":"Sermon LXXXV.

But in respect to bodies, it may be the case that this gold and that gold may be equally true [real], but this may be greater than that, since magnitude is not the same thing in this case as truth; and it is one thing for it to be gold, another to be great. So also in the nature of the soul; a soul is not called great in the same respect in which it is called true. For he, too, has a true [real] soul who has not a great soul; since the essence of body and soul is not the essence of the truth [reality] itself; as is the Trinity, one God, alone, great, true, truthful, the truth. Of whom if we endeavor to think, so far as He Himself permits and grants, let us not think of any touch or embrace in local space, as if of three bodies, or of any compactness of conjunction, as fables tell of three-bodied Geryon; but let whatsoever may occur to the mind, that is of such sort as to be greater in three than in each singly, and less in one than in two, be rejected without any doubt; for so everything corporeal is rejected. But also in spiritual things let nothing changeable that may have occurred to the mind be thought of God. For when we aspire from this depth to that height, it is a step towards no small knowledge, if, before we can know what God is, we can already know what He is not. For certainly He is neither earth nor heaven; nor, as it were, earth and heaven; nor any such thing as we see in the heaven; nor any such thing as we do not see, but which perhaps is in heaven. Neither if you were to magnify in the imagination of your thought the light of the sun as much as you are able, either that it may be greater, or that it may be brighter, a thousand times as much, or times without number; neither is this God. Neither as[fn-12-P1243_542137:2-nf] we think of the pure angels as spirits animating celestial bodies, and changing and dealing with them after the will by which they serve God; not even if all, and there are \"thousands of thousands,\"[fn-12-P1244_542380:3-nf] were brought together into one, and became one; neither is any such thing God. Neither if you were to think of the same spirits as without bodies-a thing indeed most difficult for carnal thought to do. Behold and see, if thou canst, O soul pressed down by the corruptible body, and weighed down by earthly thoughts, many and various; behold and see, if thou canst, that God is truth.[fn-12-P1245_542780:4-nf] For it is written that \"God is light;\"[fn-12-P1246_542836:5-nf] not in such way as these eyes see, but in such way as the heart sees, when it is said, He is truth [reality]. Ask not what is truth [reality] for immediately the darkness of corporeal images and the clouds of phantasms will put themselves in the way, and will disturb that calm which at the first twinkling shone forth to thee, when I said truth [reality]. See that thou remainest, if thou canst, in that first twinkling with which thou art dazzled, as it were, by a flash, when it is said to thee, Truth [Reality]. But thou canst not; thou wilt glide back into those usual and earthly things. And what weight, pray, is it that will cause thee so to glide back, unless it be the bird-lime of the stains of appetite thou hast contracted, and the errors of thy wandering from the right path?","title":"Book VIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_14_book_viii_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"35","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"12. Let no one say, I do not know what I love. Let him love his brother, and he will love the same love. For he knows the love with which he loves, more than the brother whom he loves. So now he can know God more than he knows his brother: clearly known more, because more present; known more, because more within him; known more, because more certain. Embrace the love of God, and by love embrace God. That is love itself, which associates together all good angels and all the servants of God by the bond of sanctity, and joins together us and them mutually with ourselves, and joins. us subordinately to Himself. In proportion, therefore, as we are healed from the swelling of pride, in such proportion are we more filled with love; and with what is he fall, who is full of love, except with God? Well, but you will say, I see love, and, as far as I am able, I gaze upon it with my mind, and I believe the Scripture, saying, that \"God is love; and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God;\"[fn-12-P1293_575763:30-nf] but when I see love, I do not see in it the Trinity. Nay, but thou dost see the Trinity if thou seest love. But if I can I will put you in mind, that thou mayest see that thou seest it; only let itself be present, that we may be moved by love to something good. Since, when we love love, we love one who loves something, and that on account of this very thing, that he does love something; therefore what does love love, that love itself also may be loved? For that is not love which loves nothing. But if it loves itself it must love something, that it may love itself as love. For as a word indicates something, and indicates also itself, but does not indicate itself to be a word, unless it indicates that it does indicate something; so love also loves indeed itself, but except it love itself as loving something, it loves itself not as love. What therefore does love love, except that which we love with love? But this, to begin from that which is nearest to us, is our brother. And listen how greatly the Apostle John commends brotherly love: \"He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.\"[fn-12-P1294_576931:31-nf] It is manifest that he placed the perfection of righteousness in the love of our brother; for he certainly is perfect in whom \"there is no occasion of stumbling.\" And yet he seems to have passed by the love of God in silence; which he never would have done, unless because he intends God to be understood in brotherly love itself. For in this same epistle, a little further on, he says most plainly thus: \"Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love.\" And this passage declares sufficiently and plainly, that this same brotherly love itself (for that is brotherly love by which we love each other) is set forth by so great authority, not only to be from God, but also to be God. When, therefore, we love our brother from love, we love our brother from God; neither can it be that we do not love above all else that same love by which we love our brother: whence it may be gathered that these two commandments cannot exist unless interchangeably. For since \"God is love,\" he who loves love certainly loves God; but he must needs love love, who loves his brother. And so a little after he says, \"For he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen\"?[fn-12-P1295_578265:32-nf] because the reason that he does not see God is, that he does not love his brother. For he who does not love his brother, abideth not in love; and he who abideth not in love, abideth not in God, because God is love. Further, he who abideth not in God, abideth not in light; for \"God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all.\"[fn-12-P1296_578618:33-nf] He therefore who abideth not in light, what wonder is it if he does not see light, that is, does not see God, because he is in darkness? But he sees his brother with human sight, with which God cannot be seen. But if he loved with spiritual love him whom he sees with human sight, he would see God, who is love itself, with the inner sight by which He can be seen. Therefore he who does not love his brother whom he sees, how can he love God, whom on that account he does not see, because God is love, which he has not who does not love his brother? Neither let that further question disturb us, how much of love we ought to spend upon our brother, and how much upon God: incomparably more upon God than upon ourselves, but upon our brother as much as upon ourselves; and we love ourselves so much the more, the more we love God. Therefore we love God and our neighbor from one and the same love; but we love God for the sake of God, and ourselves and our neighbors for the sake of God.","title":"Book VIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_14_on_the_spirit_and_the_letter","source_chapter":67,"source_paragraph":"201","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Forasmuch, however, as an inferior righteousness may be said to be competent to this life, whereby the just man lives by faith[fn-18-P1839_802211:385-nf] although absent from the Lord, and, therefore, walking by faith and not yet by sight,[fn-18-P1840_802317:386-nf] -it may be without absurdity said, no doubt, in respect of it, that it is free from sin; for it ought not to be attributed to it as a fault, that it is not as yet sufficient for so great a love to God as is due to the final, complete, and perfect condition thereof. It is one thing to fail at present in attaining to the fulness of love, and another thing to be swayed by no lust. A man ought therefore to abstain from every unlawful desire, although he loves God now far less than it is possible to love Him when He becomes an object of sight; just as in matters connected with the bodily senses, the eye can receive no pleasure from any kind of darkness, although it may be unable to look with a firm sight amidst refulgent light. Only let us see to it that we so constitute the soul of man in this corruptible body,that, although it has not yet swallowed up and consumed the motions of earthly lust in that super-eminent perfection of the love of God, it nevertheless, in that inferior righteousness to which we have referred, gives no consent to the aforesaid lust for the purpose of effecting any unlawful thing. In respect, therefore, of that immortal life, the commandment is even now applicable: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might;\"[fn-18-P1841_803645:387-nf] but in reference to the present life the following: \"Let not sin reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.\"[fn-18-P1842_803803:388-nf] To the one, again, belongs, \"Thou shalt not covet;\"[fn-18-P1843_803875:389-nf] to the other, \"Thou shalt not go after thy lusts.\"[fn-18-P1844_803945:390-nf] To the one it appertains to seek for nothing more than to continue in its perfect state; to the other it belongs actively to do the duty committed to it, and to hope as its reward for the perfection of the future life,-so that in the one the just man may live forevermore in the sight of that happiness which in this life was his object of desire; in the other, he may live by that faith whereon rests his desire for the ultimate blessedness as its certain end. (These things being so, it will be sin in the man who lives by faith ever to consent to an unlawful delight,-by committing not only frightful deeds and crimes, but even trifling faults; sinful, if he lend an ear to a word that ought not to be listened to, or a tongue to a phrase which shouldnot be uttered; sinful, if he entertains a thought in his heart in such a way as to wish that an evil pleasure were a lawful one, although known to be unlawful by the commandment,-for this amounts to a consent to sin, which would certainly be carried out in act, unless fear of punishment deterred.)[fn-18-P1845_805025:391-nf] Have such just men, while living by faith, no need to say: \"Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors?\"[fn-18-P1846_805344:392-nf] And do they prove this to be wrong which is written, \"In Thy sight shall no man living be justified?\"[fn-18-P1847_805466:393-nf] and this: \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us?\"[fn-18-P1848_805581:394-nf] and, \"There is no manthat sinneth not;\"[fn-18-P1849_805641:395-nf] and again, \"There is not on the earth a righteous man, who doeth good and sinneth not\"[fn-18-P1850_805753:396-nf] (for both these statements are expressed in a general future sense,-\"sinneth not,\" \"will not sin,\"-not in the past time, \"has not sinned\")?-and all other places of this purport contained in the Holy Scripture? Since, however, these passages cannot possibly be false, it plainly follows, to my mind, that whatever be the quality or extent of the righteousness which we may definitely ascribe to the present life, there is not a man living in it who is absolutely free from all sin; and that it is necessary for every one to give, that it may be given to him;[fn-18-P1851_806335:397-nf] and to forgive, that it may be forgiven him;[fn-18-P1852_806404:398-nf] and whatever righteousness he has, not to presume that he has it of himself, but from the grace of God, who justifies him, and still to go on hungering and thirsting for righteousness[fn-18-P1853_806607:399-nf] from Him who is the living bread,[fn-18-P1854_806660:400-nf] and with whom is the fountain of life;[fn-18-P1855_806719:401-nf] who works in His saints, whilst labouring amidst temptation in this life, their justification in such manner that He may still have somewhat to impart to them liberally when they ask, and something mercifully to forgive them when they confess.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_12_book_vii_","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"192","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"10 Then he writes also an epistle: `John to the seven churches which are in Asia, grace be with you, and peace.'[fn-46-P4613_2127482:188-nf] But the evangelist did not prefix his name even to the Catholic Epistle; but without introduction he begins with the mystery of the divine revelation itself: `That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes.'[fn-46-P4614_2127750:189-nf] For because of such a revelation the Lord also blessed Peter, saying, `Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my heavenly Father.'[fn-46-P4615_2127953:190-nf] ","title":"Book VII.","author":"Eusebius Pamphilus"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_12_book_vii_","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"200","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"18 For the Gospel and Epistle agree with each other and begin in the same manner.

Accordingly, the sense in which he says we \"are utterly purified\" is, not in so far as we sin, but in so far as we do not sin. For, \"walking in the light,\" but not having communion with darkness, we shall act as they that are \"utterly purified; \"sin not being quite laid down, but not being wittingly committed.

For he affirms that we do not sin at all; and to this end he treats at large, that he may make no such concession; setting forth that sins have been once for all deleted by Christ, not subsequently to obtain pardon; in which statement the sense requires us (to apply the statement) to an admonition to chastity. \"Every one,\" he says, \"who hath this hope, maketh himself chaste, because He too is chaste.

This would be a real difficulty and one for ever incapable of solution were it not solved by the witness of John himself, who immediately goes on to say,[fn-65-P6593_2064420:4-nf] \"My little children, guard yourselves from idols.\" If everyone that is born of God sinneth not, and cannot be tempted by the devil, how is it that he bids them beware of temptation? Again in the same Epistle we read:[fn-65-P6594_2064654:5-nf] \"If we say that we have no sins, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.\" I suppose that John was baptized and was writing to the baptized: I imagine too that all sin is of the devil. Now John confesses himself a sinner, and hopes for forgiveness of sins after baptism. My friend Jovinianus says,[fn-65-P6595_2065178:6-nf] \"Touch me not, for I am clean.\" What then? Does the Apostle contradict himself? By no means. In the same passage he gives his reason for thus speaking:[fn-65-P6596_2065429:7-nf] \"My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye may not sin. But if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: and he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the whole world. And hereby know we that we know him, if we keep his commandments. He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily hath the love of God been perfected. Hereby know we that we are in him: he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked.\" My reason for telling you, little children, that everyone who is born of God sinneth not, is that you may not sin, and that you may know that so long as you sin not I you abide in the birth which God has given you. Yea, they who abide in that birth cannot sin.[fn-65-P6597_2066320:8-nf] \"For what communion hath light with darkness? Or Christ with Belial?\" As day is distinct from night, so righteousness and unrighteousness, sin and good works, Christ and Antichrist cannot blend. If we give Christ a lodging-place in our hearts, we banish the devil from thence. If we sin and the devil enter through the gate of sin, Christ will immediately withdraw. Hence David after sinning says:[fn-65-P6598_2066751:9-nf] \"Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation,\" that is, the joy which he had lost by sinning.[fn-65-P6599_2066858:10-nf] \"He who saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.\" Christ is called the truth:[fn-66-P6600_2067007:11-nf] \"I am the way, the truth, and the life.\" In vain do we make our boast in him whose commandments we keep not. To him that knoweth what is good, and doeth it not, it is sin.[fn-66-P6601_2067199:12-nf] \"As the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.\" And we must not think it a great matter to know the only God, when even devils believe and tremble. \"He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked.\" Our opponent may choose whichever of the two he likes; we give him his choice. Does he abide in Christ, or not? If he abide, let him then walk as Christ walked. But if there is[fn-66-P6602_2067660:13-nf] rashness in professing to copy the virtues of our Lord, he does not abide in Christ, for he does not walk as did Christ.[fn-66-P6603_2068078:14-nf] \"He did not sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: when he was reviled, he reviled not again, and as a lamb is dumb before its shearer, so opened he not his mouth.\" To Him came the prince of this world, and found nothing in Him: although He had done no sin, God made Him sin for us. But we, according to the Epistle of James,[fn-66-P6604_2068429:15-nf] \"all stumble in many things,\" and[fn-66-P6605_2068482:16-nf] \"no one is pure from sin, no not if his life be but a day long.\"[fn-66-P6606_2068582:17-nf] For who will boast \"that he has a clean heart? or who will be sure that he is pure from sin?\" And we are held guilty after the similitude of Adam's transgression. Hence David says,[fn-66-P6607_2068781:18-nf] \"Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.\" And the blessed Job,[fn-66-P6608_2068892:19-nf] \"Though I be righteous my mouth will speak wickedness, and though I be perfect, I shall be found perverse. If I wash myself with snow water and make my hands never so clean, yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch and mine own clothes shall abhor me.\" But that we may not utterly despair and think that if we sin after baptism we cannot be saved, he immediately checks the tendency:[fn-66-P6609_2069307:20-nf] \"And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our sins. And not for ours only, but also for the whole world.\" He addresses this to baptized believers, and he promises them the Lord as an advocate for their offences. He does not say: If you fall into sin, you have an advocate with the Father, Christ, and He is the propitiation for your sins: you might then say that he was addressing those whose baptism had been destitute of the true faith: but what he says is this, \"We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, and he is the propitiation for our sins.\" And not only for the sins of John and his contemporaries, but for those of the whole world. Now in \"the whole world\" are included apostles and all the faithful, and a clear proof is established that sin after baptism is possible. It is useless for us to have an advocate Jesus Christ, if sin be impossible.","title":"Book II.","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_16_on_nature_and_grace_against_pelagius","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"118","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"That, too, which is said to him, \"that it is nowhere written in so many words, A man can be without sin,\" he easily refutes thus: \"That the question here is not in what precise words each doctrinal statement is made.\" It is perhaps not without reason that, while in several passages of Scripture we may find it said that men are without excuse, it is nowhere found that any man is described as being without sin, except Him only, of whom it is plainly said, that \"He knew no sin.\"[fn-19-P1968_837435:33-nf] Similarly, we read in the passage where the subject is concerning priests: \"He was in all points tempted like as we are, only without sin,\"[fn-19-P1969_837594:34-nf] -meaning, of course, in that flesh which bore the likeness of sinful flesh, although it was not sinful flesh; a likeness, indeed, which it would not have borne if it had not been in every other respect the same as sinful flesh.

They are the faculties of seeing, and hearing, and smelling, and tasting, and touching. The fidelity of these senses is impugned with too much severity by the Platonists,[fn-27-P2737_915262:118-nf] and according to some by Heraclitus also, and Diocles, and Empedocles; at any rate, Plato, in the Timµus, declares the operations of the senses to be irrational, and vitiated[fn-27-P2738_915455:119-nf] by our opinions or beliefs. Deception is imputed to the sight, because it asserts that oars, when immersed in the water, are inclined or bent, notwithstanding the certainty that they are straight; because, again, it is quite sure that distant tower with its really quadrangular contour is round; because also it will discredit the fact of the truly parallel fabric of yonder porch or arcade, by supposing it to be narrower and narrower towards its end; and because it will join with the sea the sky which hangs at so great a height above it. In the same way, our hearing is charged with fallacy: we think, for instance, that is a noise in the sky which is nothing else than the rumbling of a carriage; or, if you prefer it[fn-27-P2739_916255:120-nf] the other way, when the thunder rolled at a distance, we were quite sure that it was a carriage which made the noise. Thus, too, are our faculties of smell and taste at fault, because the selfsame perfumes and wines lose their value after we have used them awhile. On the same principle our touch is censured, when the identical pavement which seemed rough to the hands is felt by the feet to be smooth enough; and in the baths a stream of warm water is pronounced to be quite hot at first, and beautifully temperate afterwards. Thus, according to them, our senses deceive us, when all the while we are (the cause of the discrepancies, by) changing our opinions. The Stoics are more moderate in their views; for they do not load with the obloquy of deception every one of the senses, and at all times. The Epicureans, again, show still greater consistency, in maintaining that all the senses are equally true in their testimony, and always so-only in a different way. It is not our organs of sensation that are at fault, but our opinion. The senses only experience sensation, they do not exercise opinion; it is the soul that opines. They separated opinion from the senses, and sensation from the soul. Well, but whence comes opinion, if not from the senses? Indeed, unless the eye had descried a round shape in that tower, it could have had no idea that it possessed roundness. Again, whence arises sensation if not from the soul? For if the soul had no body, it would have no sensation. Accordingly, sensation comes from the soul, and opinion from sensation; and the whole (process) is the soul. But further, it may well be insisted on that there is a something which causes the discrepancy between the report of the senses and the reality of the facts. Now, since it is possible, (as we have seen), for phenomena to be reported which exist not in the objects, why should it not be equally possible for phenomena to be reported which are caused not by the senses, but by reasons and conditions which intervene, in the very nature of the case? If so, it will be only right that they should be duly recognised. The truth is, that it was the water which was the cause of the oar seeming to be inclined or bent: out of the water, it was perfectly straight in appearance (as well as in fact). The delicacy of the substance or medium which forms a mirror by means of its luminosity, according as it is struck or shaken, by the vibration actually destroys the appearance of the straightness of a right line. In like manner, the condition of the open space which fills up the interval between it and us, necessarily causes the true shape of the tower to escape our notice; for the uniform density of the surrounding air covering its angles with a similar light obliterates their outlines. So, again, the equal breadth of the arcade is sharpened or narrowed off towards its termination, until its aspect, becoming more and more contracted under its prolonged roof, comes to a vanishing point in the direction of its farthest distance. So the sky blends itself with the sea, the vision becoming spent at last, which had maintained duly the boundaries of the two elements, so long as its vigorous glance lasted. As for the (alleged cases of deceptive) hearing, what else could produce the illusion but the similarity of the sounds? And if the perfume afterwards was less strong to the smell, and the wine more flat to the taste, and the water not so hot to the touch, their original strength was after all found in the whole of them pretty well unimpaired. In the matter, however, of the roughness and smoothness of the pavement, it was only natural and right that limbs like the hands and the feet, so different in tenderness and callousness, should have different impressions. In this way, then, there cannot occur an illusion in our senses without an adequate cause. Now if special causes, (such as we have indicated, ) mislead our senses add (through our senses) our opinions also, then we must no longer ascribe the deception to the senses, which follow the specific causes of the illusion, nor to the opinions we form; for these are occasioned and controlled by our senses, which only follow the causes. Persons who are afflicted with madness or insanity, mistake one object for another. Orestes in his sister sees his mother; Ajax sees Ulysses in the slaughtered herd; Athamas and Agave descry wild beasts in their children. Now is it their eyes or their phrenzy which you must blame for so vast a fallacy? All things taste bitter, in the redundancy of their bile, to those who have the jaundice. Is it their taste which you will charge with the physical prevarication, or their ill state of health? All the senses, therefore, are disordered occasionally, or imposed upon, but only in such a way as to be quite free of any fault in their own natural functions. But further still, not even against the specific causes and conditions themselves must we lay an indictment of deception. For, since these physical aberrations happen for stated reasons, the reasons do not deserve to be regarded as deceptions. Whatever ought to occur in a certain manner is not a deception. If, then, even these circumstantial causes must be acquitted of all censure and blame, how much more should we free from reproach the senses, over which the said causes exercise a liberal sway! Hence we are bound most certainly to claim for the senses truth, and fidelity, and integrity, seeing that they never render any other account of their impressions than is enjoined on them by the specific causes or conditions which in all cases produce that discrepancy which appears between the report of the senses and the reality of the objects. What mean you, then, O most insolent Academy? You overthrow the entire condition of human life; you disturb the whole order of nature; you obscure the good providence of God Himself: for the senses of man which God has appointed over all His works, that we might understand, inhabit, dispense, and enjoy them, (you reproach) as fallacious and treacherous tyrants! But is it not from these that all creation receives our services? Is it not by their means that a second form is impressed even upon the world?-so many arts, so many industrious resources, so many pursuits, such business, such offices, such commerce, such remedies, counsels, consolations, modes, civilizations, and accomplishments of life! All these things have produced the very relish and savour of human existence; whilst by these senses of man, he alone of all animated nature has the distinction of being a rational animal, with a capacity for intelligence and knowledge-nay, an ability to form the Academy itself! But Plato, in order to disparage the testimony of the senses, in the Phµdrus denies (in the person of Socrates) his own ability to know even himself, according to the injunction of the Delphic oracle; and in the Theµtetus he deprives himself of the faculties of knowledge and sensation; and again, in the Phµdrus he postpones till after death the posthumous knowledge, as he calls it, of the truth; and yet for all he went on playing the philosopher even before he died. We may not, I say, we may not call into question the truth of the (poor vilified) senses,[fn-27-P2740_923523:121-nf] lest we should even in Christ Himself, bring doubt upon[fn-27-P2741_923600:122-nf] the truth of their sensation; lest perchance it should be said that He did not really \"behold Satan as lightning fall from heaven; \"[fn-27-P2742_923753:123-nf] that He did not really hear the Father's voice testifying of Himself;[fn-27-P2743_923842:124-nf] or that He was deceived in touching Peter's wife's mother;[fn-27-P2744_923923:125-nf] or that the fragrance of the ointment which He afterwards smelled was different from that which He accepted for His burial;[fn-27-P2745_924070:126-nf] and that the taste of the wine was different from that which He consecrated in memory of His blood.[fn-27-P2746_924195:127-nf] On this false principle it was that Marcion actually chose to believe that He was a phantom, denying to Him the reality of a perfect body.

In us, therefore, these affections arise from human infirmity; but it was not so with the Lord Jesus, for even His infirmity was the consequence of His power. But so long as we wear the infirmity of this life, we are rather worse men than better if we have none of these emotions at all.

And therefore that which the Greeks call a0paqeia, and what the Latins would call, if their language would allow them, \"impassibilitas,\" if it be taken to mean an impassibility of spirit and not of body, or, in other words, a freedom from those emotions which are contrary to reason and disturb the mind, then it is obviously a good and most desirable quality, but it is not one which is attainable in this life. For the words of the apostle are the confession, not of the common herd, but of the eminently pious, just, and holy men: \"If we say we have: no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\"[fn-24-P2408_1340630:79-nf] When there shall be no sin in a man, then there shall be this apa/qeia.

It may, indeed, reasonably be maintained that the perfect blessedness we hope for shall be free from all sting of fear or sadness; but who thai is not quite lost to truth would say that neither love nor joy shall be experienced there?

Therefore, as the Word of Life is Life, so, too, the Spirit of Life is Life.","title":"Book I.","author":"St. Ambrose"},{"chapter":1,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_15_book_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"74","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"A.

Cyprian, in the fifty-fourth heading of the third book, lays it down that no one is free from stain and without sin, and he immediately gives proofs, among them the passage in Job,[fn-74-P7448_2474586:102-nf] \"Who is cleansed from uncleanness? Not he who has lived but one day upon the earth.\"[fn-74-P7449_2474690:103-nf] And in the fifty-first Psalm, \"Behold I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.\" And in the Epistle of John,[fn-74-P7450_2474839:104-nf] \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\" You, on the other hand, maintain that \"A man can be without sin,\" and that you may give your words the semblance of truth, you immediately add, \"And easily keep the commandments of God, if he chooses,\" and yet they have been seldom or never kept by any one. Now, if they were easy, they ought to have been kept by all. But if, to concede you a point, at rare intervals some one may be found able to keep them, it is clear that what is rare is difficult. And by way of supplementing this and displaying the greatness of your own virtues (we are to believe, forsooth, that you bring forth the sentiment out of the treasure of a good conscience), you have a heading to the effect that: \"We ought not to commit even light offences.\" And for fear some one might think you had not explained in the work the meaning of light, you add that, \"We must not even think an evil thought,\" forgetting the words,[fn-74-P7451_2475839:105-nf] \"Who understands his offences? Clear thou me from hidden faults, and keep back thy servant from presumptuous sins, O Lord.\" You should have known that the Church admits even failures through ignorance and sins of mere thought to be offences; so much so that she bids sacrifices be offered for errors, and the high priest who makes intercession for the whole people previously offers victims for himself. Now, if he were not himself righteous, he would never be commanded to offer for others. Nor, again, would he offer for himself if he were free from sins of ignorance.

Touching the second, however, of these points, we ought to pay careful attention to what he said in answer to the charge against him. \"Concerning the fact, indeed,\" says he, \"that before the Lord's coming there were persons without sin, we now again assert that previous to Christ's advent some men lived holy and righteous lives, according to the teaching of the sacred Scriptures.\" He did not dare to say: \"We now again assert that previous to Christ's advent there were persons without sin,\" although this had been laid to his charge after the very words of Coelestius. For he perceived how dangerous such a statement was, and into what trouble it would bring him. So he reduced the sentence to these harmless dimensions: \"We again assert that before the coming of Christ there were persons who led holy and righteous lives.\" Of course there were: who would deny it? But to say this is a very different thing from saying that they lived \"without sin.\" Because, indeed, those ancient worthies lived holy and righteous lives, they could for that very reason better confess: \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\"[fn-29-P2956_1145287:74-nf] In the present day, also, many men live holy and righteous lives; but yet it is no untruth they utter when in their prayer they say: \"Forgive us our debts, even as we forgive our debtors.\"[fn-29-P2957_1145494:75-nf] This avowal was accordingly acceptable to the judges, in the sense in which Pelagius solemnly declared his belief; but certainly not in the sense which Coelestius, according to the original charge against him, was said to hold.

Hence, in the order of the Creed, after the mention of the Holy Church is placed the remission of sins. For it is by this that the Church on earth stands: it is through this that what had been lost, and was found, is saved from being lost again. For, setting aside the grace of baptism, which is given as an antidote to original sin, so that what our birth imposes upon us, our new birth relieves us from (this grace, however, takes away all the actual sins also that have been committed in thought, word, and deed): setting aside, then, this great act of favor, whence commences man's restoration, and in which all our guilt, both original and actual, is washed away, the rest of our life from the time that we have the use of reason provides constant occasion for the remission of sins, however great may be our advance in righteousness.

Now they themselves, when they have been purified, shall be sacrifices of complete and perfect righteousness; for what more acceptable offering can such persons make to God than themselves? But this question of purgatorial punishments we must defer to another time, to give it a more adequate treatment.

But, say they, how is the flesh by a certain likeness compared unto the Church? What! doth the Church lust against Christ? whereas the same Apostle said, \"The Church is subject unto Christ.\"[fn-36-P3690_1741741:92-nf] Clearly the Church is subject unto Christ; because the spirit therefore lusteth against the flesh, that on every side the Church may be made subject to Christ; but the flesh lusteth against the spirit, because not as yet hath the Church received that peace which was promised perfect. And for this reason the Church is made subject unto Christ for the pledge of salvation, and the flesh lusteth against the spirit from the weakness of sickness. For neither were those other than members of the Church, unto whom he thus spake, \"Walk in the spirit, and fulfill not the lusts of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; for these are opposed the one to the other; that ye do not what we would.\"[fn-36-P3691_1742498:93-nf] These things were assuredly spoken unto the Church, which if it were not made subject unto Christ, the spirit would not in it lust against the flesh through continence. By reason of which they were indeed able not to perfect the lusts of the flesh, but through the flesh lusting against the Spirit they were not able to do the things which they would, that is, not even to have the very lusts of the flesh. Lastly, why should we not confess that in spiritual men the Church is subject unto Christ, but in carnal men yet lusteth against Christ? Did not they lust against Christ unto whom it was said, \"Is Christ divided?\"[fn-36-P3692_1743141:94-nf] and, \"I could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal. I have given unto yon milk to drink as unto babes in Christ, not meat, for ye were not as yet able; but not even now are ye able: for ye are still carnal. For whereas there is among you emulation, and strife, are ye not carnal?\"[fn-36-P3693_1743461:95-nf] Against whom doth emulation and strife lust, but against Christ? For these lusts of the flesh Christ healeth in His own, but loveth in none. Whence the holy Church, so long as it hath such members, is not yet without spot or wrinkle. To these are added those other sins also, for which the daily cry of the whole Church is, \"Forgive us our debts:\"[fn-36-P3694_1743835:96-nf] and, that we should not think spiritual persons exempt from these, not any one soever of carnal persons, nor any one soever of spiritual persons themselves, but he, who lay on the breast of the Lord,[fn-36-P3695_1744054:97-nf] and whom He loved before others, saith, \"If we shall say that we have not sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\"[fn-36-P3696_1744204:98-nf] But in every sin, more in what is greater, less in what is less, there is an act of lust against righteousness. And of Christ it is written: \"Who was made unto us by God, Wisdom, and Righteousness, and Sanctification, and Redemption.\"[fn-36-P3697_1744457:99-nf] In every sin therefore without doubt there is an act of lust against Christ. But when He, Who \"healeth all our sicknesses,\"[fn-36-P3698_1744601:100-nf] a shall have led His Church unto the promised healing of sickness, then in none of its members shall there be any, even the very least spot or wrinkle. Then in no way shall the flesh lust against the spirit, and therefore there shall be no cause why the spirit also lust against the flesh. Then all this conflict shall come to an end, then there shall be the highest concord of both substances; then to such a degree shall no one there be carnal, that even the flesh itself shall be spiritual. What therefore each one living after Christ doth with his flesh, whereas he both lusts against its evil lust, which he restrains, hereafter to be healed, which he holds, not yet healed; and yet nourisheth and cherisheth its good nature, since \"no one ever hated his own flesh,\"[fn-36-P3699_1745393:101-nf] this also Christ doth with the Church, so far as it is lawful to compare lesser with greater matters. For He both represses it with rebukes, that it burst not being puffed up with impunity; and raises it up with consolations, that it sink not being weighed down with infirmity. Hence is that of the Apostle, \"For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged; but when we are judged, we are rebuked of the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world.\"[fn-37-P3700_1745874:102-nf] And that in the Psalm, \"After the multitude of my griefs in my heart, Thy consolations have gladdened my soul.\"[fn-37-P3701_1746012:103-nf] We are therefore then to hope for perfect soundness of our flesh without any opposition, when there shall be sure security of the Church of Christ without any fear.","title":"On Continence.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_25_book_iii_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"22.

From their not distinguishing between the light which is God, and the light which God made, they imagine that God must have been in darkness before He made light, because darkness was over the deep before God said, \"Let there be light, and there was light.\" In the New Testament both these things are ascribed to God.

But sometimes a peril to eternal salvation itself is put forth against us;[fn-45-P4507_2211241:84-nf] which peril, they cry out, we by telling a lie, if otherwise if cannot be, must ward off. As, for instance, if a person who is to be baptized be in the power of impious and infidel men, and cannot be got at that he may be washed with the layer of regeneration, but by deceiving his keepers with a lie. From this most invidious cry, by which we are compelled, not for a man's wealth or honors in this world which are fleeting by, not for the life itself of this present time, but for the eternal salvation of a human being, to tell a lie, whither shall I betake me for refuge but unto thee, O truth? And by thee is put forth before me,[fn-45-P4508_2211893:85-nf] Chastity. For why, if those keepers may be enticed to admit us to baptize the man, by our committing lewdness, do we refuse to do things contrary to chastity, and yet, if by a lie they may be deceived, consent to do things contrary to truth? when without doubt no man would faithfully think chastity amiable, but because it is enjoined of truth? So then, to get at a man to baptize him, let the keepers be deceived by lying, if truth bid it. But how can truth bid in order that a man may be baptized, that we should tell a lie, if chastity biddeth not, in order that a man be baptized, that we should commit whoredom? Now why doth chastity not bid this, but because this truth teacheth not? If then, save what truth teacheth, we ought not to do, when truth teacheth not even for the sake of baptizing a man to do what is contrary to chastity, how shall she teach us to do for the sake of baptizing a man what is contrary to herself, the truth? But like as eyes not strong enough to look upon the sun yet do gladly look upon the objects which are by the sun enlightened, so, souls which have already strength to delight in the beauty of chastity are yet not straightway able to consider in her very self that truth whence charity hath her light, insomuch that when it cometh to the doing of somewhat that is adverse to truth, they should so start back in horror as they do start back in horror if aught be proposed to be done that is adverse to chastity. But that son, who, receiving the word shall be far from perdition, and nothing false cometh forth of his mouth,[fn-45-P4509_2213478:86-nf] accounts it as much debarred from him if, to the succoring of his fellow man he be urged to pass through a lie, as if it were through the deed of lewdness. And the Father heareth and granteth his prayer that he may avail without a lie to succor whom the Father Himself, Whose judgments are un-searchable, willeth to be succored. Such a son therefore so keeps watch against a lie, as he doth against sin. For indeed sometimes the name of lie is put for the name of sin: whence is that saying, \"All men are liars.\"[fn-45-P4510_2214018:87-nf] For it is so said, as if it were said, \"All men are sinners.\" And that: \"But if the truth of God hath abounded through my lie.\"[fn-45-P4511_2214177:88-nf] And therefore, when he lies as a man he sins as a man, and will be held by that sentence in which it is said, \"All men are liars;\" and, \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\"[fn-45-P4512_2214414:89-nf] But when nothing false cometh forth of his mouth, according to that grace will it so be, of which is said: \"He that is born of God, sinneth not.\"[fn-45-P4513_2214578:90-nf] For were this nativity by itself alone in us, no man would sin: and when it shall be alone, no man will sin.

Indeed,[fn-94-P9444_2594795:168-nf] without the soul we are nothing; there is not even the name of a human being, only that of a carcase. If, then, we are ignorant of the soul, it is in fact the soul that is ignorant of itself. Thus the only remaining question left for us to look into is, whether the soul was in this matter so ignorant of itself that it became known in any way it could.[fn-94-P9445_2595165:169-nf] The soul, in my opinion,[fn-94-P9446_2595210:170-nf] is sensual.[fn-94-P9447_2595237:171-nf] Nothing, therefore, pertaining to the soul is unconnected with sense,[fn-94-P9448_2595345:172-nf] nothing pertaining to sense is unconnected with the soul.[fn-94-P9449_2595436:173-nf] And if I may use the expression for the sake of emphasis, I would say, \"Anim£ anima sensus est\"-\"Sense is the soul's very soul.\" Now, since it is the soul that imparts the faculty of perception[fn-94-P9450_2595664:174-nf] to all (that have sense), and since it is itself that perceives the very senses, not to say properties, of them all how is it likely that it did not itself receive sense as its own natural constitution? Whence is it to know what is necessary for itself under given circumstances, from the very necessity of natural causes, if it knows not its own property, and what is necessary for it? To recognise this indeed is within the competence of every soul; it has, I mean, a practical knowledge of itself, without which knowledge of itself no soul could possibly have exercised its own functions.[fn-94-P9451_2596388:175-nf] I suppose, too, that it is especially suitable that man, the only rational animal, should have been furnished with such a soul as would make him the rational animal, itself being pre-eminently rational. Now, how can that soul which makes man a rational animal be itself rational if it be itself ignorant of its rationality, being ignorant of its own very self? So far, however, is it from being ignorant, that it knows its own Author, its own Master, and its own condition. Before it learns anything about God, it names the name of God. Before it acquires any knowledge of His judgment, it professes to commend itself to God. There is nothing one oftener hears of than that there is no hope after death; and yet what imprecations or deprecations does not the soul use according as the man dies after a well or ill spent life! These reflections are more fully pursued in a short treatise which we have written, \"On the Testimony of the Soul.\"[fn-94-P9452_2597352:176-nf] Besides, if the soul was ignorant of itself from the beginning, there is nothing it could[fn-94-P9453_2597481:177-nf] have learnt of Christ except its own quality.[fn-94-P9454_2597544:178-nf] It was not its own form that it learnt of Christ, but its salvation. For this cause did the Son of God descend and take on Him a soul, not that the soul might discover itself in Christ, but Christ in itself. For its salvation is endangered, not by its being ignorant of itself, but of the word of God. \"The life,\" says He, \"was manifested,\"[fn-94-P9455_2597911:179-nf] not the soul. And again, \"I am come to save the soul.\" He did not say, \"to explain\"[fn-94-P9456_2598015:180-nf] it. We could not know, of course,[fn-94-P9457_2598084:181-nf] that the soul, although an invisible essence, is born and dies, unless it were exhibited corporeally. We certainly were ignorant that it was to rise again with the flesh. This is the truth which it will be found was manifested by Christ. But even this He did not manifest in Himself in a different way than in some Lazarus, whose flesh was no more composed of soul[fn-94-P9458_2598465:182-nf] than his soul was of flesh.[fn-94-P9459_2598510:183-nf] What further knowledge, therefore, have we received of the structure[fn-94-P9460_2598596:184-nf] of the soul which we were ignorant of before? What invisible part was there belonging to it which wanted to be made visible by the flesh?

The light of men is a generic notion covering two special things; and with the darkness of men it is the same. He who has gained the light of men and shares its beams will do the work of light and know in the higher sense, being illuminated by the light of the higher knowledge. And we must recognize the analogous case of those on the other side, and of their evil actions, and of that which is thought to be bat is not really knowledge, since those who exercise it have the reason (Logos) not of light but of darkness. And because the sacred word knows the things which produce light, isaiah says:[fn-65-P6552_1122832:70-nf] \"Because Thy commandments are a light upon the earth,\" and David says in the Psalm,[fn-65-P6553_1122930:71-nf] \"The precept of the Lord is clear, enlightening the eyes.\" But since in addition to the commandments and the precepts there is a light of higher knowledge, we read in one of the twelve (prophets),[fn-65-P6554_1123140:72-nf] \"Sow to yourselves for righteousness, reap to yourselves for the fruit of life, make light for yourselves the light of knowledge.\" There is a further light of knowledge in addition to the commandments, and so we read, \"Make light for yourselves,\" not simply light, but what light?-the light of knowledge.

These are the misty questions of the praise of the creature, of the praise of marriage, of the praise of the law, of the praise of free will, of the praise of the saints; as if any one of our people were in the habit of disparaging those things, and not rather of announcing all things with due praises to the honour of the Creator and Saviour. But even the creature does not desire in such wise to be praised as to be unwilling to be healed. And the more marriage is to be praised, the less is to be attributed to it the shameful concupiscence of the flesh, which is not of the Father, but of the world; and which assuredly marriage found and did not make in men; because, moreover, it is actually in very many without marriage, and if nobody had sinned marriage itself might be without it. And the law, holy and just and good, is neither grace itself, nor is anything rightly done by it without grace; because the law is not given that it may give life, but it was added because of transgression, that it might conclude all persons convicted under sin, and that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.[fn-55-P5547_2179308:96-nf] And the free will taken captive does not avail, except for sin; but for righteousness, unless divinely set free and aided, it does not avail.

Lest any one should flatter himself as being innocent, and by exalting himself should more deeply perish, he is instructed and taught that he sins daily, in that he is bidden to entreat daily for his sins.

In the epistle on \"Works and Alms,\" he says: \"Let us then acknowledge, beloved brethren, the wholesome gift of the divine mercy, and let us who cannot be without some wound of conscience heal our wounds by the spiritual remedies for the cleansing and purging of our sins.

For, expounding Isaiah the Prophet in reference to what is written, \"I have begotten and brought up children, and they have despised me,\"[fn-57-P5785_2272533:126-nf] he undertook to dispute concerning the generations which are of God, and in that argument he quoted the testimony of John when he says, \"He that is bornof God sinneth not.\"[fn-57-P5786_2272724:127-nf] And, treating the samevery difficult question, he says: \"Since in this world there is none who is free from sin; since John himself says, `If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar.'[fn-57-P5787_2272941:128-nf] But if `they that are born of God sin not,' and if these words refer to those of them who are in the world, it is necessary that we should regard them as those numberless people who have obtained God's grace by the regeneration of the laver. But yet, when the prophet says, `All things are waiting upon Thee, that Thou mayest give them meat in season. That Thou givest them they gather for themselves; when Thou openest Thine hand, all things shall be filled with goodness. But when Thou turnest away Thy face, they shall be troubled: Thou shall take away their breath, and they shall fail, and shall be turned into their dust. Thou shall send forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be created: and Thou shalt renew the face of the earth,'[fn-57-P5788_2273696:129-nf] such things as these cannot seem to have been said of any time whatever but of that future time, in which there shall be a new earth and a new heaven. Therefore they shall be disturbed that they may take their beginning. `And when Thou openest Thy hand all things shall be filled with goodness,' which is not easily characteristic of this age. For concerning this age what does Scripture say? `There is none that doeth good, no, not one.'[fn-57-P5789_2274160:130-nf] If, therefore, there are different generations,-and here the very entrance into this life is the receiver of sins to such an extent that even he who begot should be despised; while another generation does not receive sins;-let us consider whether by any means there may not be a regeneration for us after the course of this life,-of which regeneration it is said, `In the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of His glory.'[fn-57-P5790_2274623:131-nf] For as that is called the regeneration of washing whereby we are renewed from the filth of sins washed away, so that seems to be called a regeneration by which we are purified from every stain of bodily materiality, and are regenerated in the pure sense of the soul to life eternal; so that every quality of regeneration may be purer than ofthat washing, so that no suspicion of sins can fall either on a man's doings, or even on his very thoughts themselves.\" Moreover, in another place in the same work he says: \"We see it to be impossible that any person created in a body can be absolutely spotless, since even Paul says I that he is imperfect. For thus he has it: `Not that I have already received, or am already perfect;'[fn-57-P5791_2275373:132-nf] and yet after a little he says, 'As many of us, therefore, as are perfect.'[fn-57-P5792_2275471:133-nf] Unless, perchance, there is one perfection in this world, another after this is completed, of which he says to the Corinthians, `When that which is perfect is come;'[fn-57-P5793_2275659:134-nf] and elsewhere, `Till we all come into the unity of the faith, and the knowledge of the Son of God, into the perfect man to the measure of the age of the fulness of Christ.'[fn-57-P5794_2275857:135-nf] As, then, the apostle says that many are placed in this world who are perfect along with him, but who, if you have regard to true perfection, could not be perfect, since he says, `We see now through a mirror, enigmatically; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then I shall know even as also I am known:'[fn-57-P5795_2276192:136-nf] so also there both are those who are 'spotless' in this world, and will be those who are 'spotless' in the kingdom of God, although certainly, if you consider it accurately, no person can be spotless, because no person is without sin.\" Also in the same he says: \"We see that, while we live in this life, we ought to purify ourselves and to seek God; and to begin from the purification of our soul, and as it were to establish the foundations of virtue, so that we may deserve to attain the perfection of our purgation after this life.\" And again, in the same he says: \"But laden and groaning, who does not say, `O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?'[fn-57-P5796_2276905:137-nf] So with the same teacher we give all varieties of interpretation. For if he is unhappy who recognises himself as involved in the evils of the body, certainly everybody is unhappy; for I should not call that man happy who, being confused with any darkness of his mind, does not know his own condition. That, moreover, has not absurdly come to be understood; for if a man who knows himself is unhappy, assuredly all are wretched, because every one either recognises his weakness by wisdom, or by folly is ignorant of it.\" Moreover, in the treatise \"On the Benefit of Death,\" he says:[fn-57-P5797_2277508:138-nf] \"Let death work in us, in order that that may work life also, a good life after death,-that is, a good life after victory, a good life after the contest is finished; so that now no longer the law of the flesh may know how to resist the law of the mind, that no longer we may have any contention with the body of death.\" Again, in the same treatise he says: \"Therefore, because the righteous have this reward, that they see the face of God, and that light which lightens every man, let us henceforth put on the desire of this kind of reward, that our soul may draw near to God, our prayer may draw near to Him, our desire may cleave, to Him, that we be not separated from Him. And placed here as we are, let us by meditating, by reading, by seeking, be united with God. Let us know Him as we can. For we know Him in part here; because here all things are imperfect, there all are perfect; here we are infants, there we shall be strong men. `We see,' says he, `now through a mirror in an enigma, but then face to face.' Then, His face being revealed, we shall be allowed to look upon the glory of God, which now our souls, involved in the compacted dregs of this body, and shadowed by some stains and filth of this flesh, cannot clearly see. `For who,' He says, `shall see my face and live?' and rightly. For if our eyes cannot bear the rays of the sun,-and if any one should gaze too long on the region of the sun he is said to be blinded,-if a creature cannot look upon a creature without deceit and offence, how can he without his own peril look upon the glittering face of the eternal Creator, covered as he is with the clothing of this body? For who is justified in God's sight, when even the infant of one day cannot be pure from sin, and no one can boast of his integrity and pureness of heart?\"","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"66","folder":"ANF-03","text":"If I fail in resolving this article (of our faith) by passages which may admit of dispute[fn-105-P10593_2975800:171-nf] out of the Old Testament, I will take out of the New Testament a confirmation of our view, that you may not straightway attribute to the Father every possible (relation and condition) which I ascribe to the Son. Behold, then, I find both in the Gospels and in the (writings of the) apostles a visible and an invisible God (revealed to us), under a manifest and personal distinction in the condition of both. There is a certain emphatic saying by John: \"No man hath seen God at any time; \"[fn-105-P10594_2976311:172-nf] meaning, of course, at any previous time But he has indeed taken away all question of time, by saying that God had never been seen.

In order, however, to reconcile this diversity between the Visible and the Invisible, will not some one on the other side argue that the two statements are quite correct: that He was visible indeed in the flesh, but was invisible before His appearance in the flesh; so that He who as the Father was invisible before the flesh, is the same as the Son who was visible in the flesh? If, however, He is the same who was invisible before the incarnation, how comes it that He was actually seen in ancient times before (coming in) the flesh? And by parity of reasoning, if He is the same who was visible after (coming in) the flesh, how happens it that He is now declared to be invisible by the apostles? How, I repeat, can all this be, unless it be that He is one, who anciently was visible only in mystery and enigma, and became more clearly visible by His incarnation, even the Word who was also made flesh; whilst He is another whom no man has seen at any time, being none else than the Father, even Him to whom the Word belongs? Let us, in short, examine who it is whom the apostles saw. \"That,\" says John, \"which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life.\"[fn-105-P10598_2978120:176-nf] Now the Word of life became flesh, and was heard, and was seen, and was handled, because He was flesh who, before He came in the flesh, was the \"Word in the beginning with God\" the Father,[fn-105-P10599_2978329:177-nf] and not the Father with the Word. For although the Word was God, yet was He with God, because He is God of God; and being joined to the Father, is with the Father.[fn-106-P10600_2978514:178-nf] \"And we have seen His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father; \"[fn-106-P10601_2978630:179-nf] that is, of course, (the glory) of the Son, even Him who was visible, and was glorified by the invisible Father. And therefore, inasmuch as he had said that the Word of God was God, in order that he might give no help to the presumption of the adversary, (which pretended) that he had seen the Father Himself and in order to draw a distinction between the invisible Father and the visible Son, he makes the additional assertion, ex abundanti as it were: \"No man hath seen God at any time.\"[fn-106-P10602_2979142:180-nf] What God does he mean? The Word? But he has already said: \"Him we have seen and heard, and our hands have handled the Word of life.\" Well, (I must again ask, ) what God does he mean? It is of course the Father, with whom was the Word, the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, and has Himself declared Him.[fn-106-P10603_2979484:181-nf] He was both heard and seen and, that He might not be supposed to be a phantom, was actually handled. Him, too, did Paul behold; but yet he saw not the Father. \"Have I not,\" he says, \"seen Jesus Christ our Lord? \"[fn-106-P10604_2979716:182-nf] Moreover, he expressly called Christ God, saying: \"Of whom are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever.\"[fn-106-P10605_2979902:183-nf] He shows us also that the Son of God, which is the Word of God, is visible, because He who became flesh was called Christ. Of the Father, however, he says to Timothy: \"Whom none among men hath seen, nor indeed can see; \"and he accumulates the description in still ampler terms: \"Who only hath immortality, and dwelleth in the light which no man can approach unto.\"[fn-106-P10606_2980285:184-nf] It was of Him, too, that he had said in a previous passage: \"Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to the only God; \"[fn-106-P10607_2980435:185-nf] so that we might apply even the contrary qualities to the Son Himself-mortality, accessibility-of whom the apostle testifies that \"He died according to the Scriptures,\"[fn-106-P10608_2980625:186-nf] and that \"He was seen by himself last of all,\"[fn-106-P10609_2980693:187-nf] -by means, of course, of the light which was accessible, although it was not without imperilling his sight that he experienced that light.[fn-106-P10610_2980847:188-nf] A like danger to which also befell Peter, and John, and James, (who confronted not the same light) without risking the loss of their reason and mind; and if they, who were unable to endure the glory of the Son,[fn-106-P10611_2981080:189-nf] had only seen the Father, they must have died then and there: \"For no man shall see God, and live.\"[fn-106-P10612_2981214:190-nf] This being the case, it is evident that He was always seen from the beginning, who became visible in the end; and that He, (on the contrary, ) was not seen in the end who had never been visible from the beginning; and that accordingly there are two-the Visible and the Invisible. It was the Son, therefore, who was always seen, and the Son who always conversed with men, and the Son who has always worked by the authority and will of the Father; because \"the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do\"[fn-106-P10613_2981760:191-nf] -\"do\" that is, in His mind and thought.[fn-106-P10614_2981819:192-nf] For the Father acts by mind and thought; whilst the Son, who is in the Father's mind and thought,[fn-106-P10615_2981934:193-nf] gives effect and form to what He sees.

Of the Father, however, he says to Timothy: \"Whom none among men hath seen, nor indeed can see; \"and he accumulates the description in still ampler terms: \"Who only hath immortality, and dwelleth in the light which no man can approach unto.\"[fn-106-P10606_2980285:184-nf] It was of Him, too, that he had said in a previous passage: \"Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to the only God; \"[fn-106-P10607_2980435:185-nf] so that we might apply even the contrary qualities to the Son Himself-mortality, accessibility-of whom the apostle testifies that \"He died according to the Scriptures,\"[fn-106-P10608_2980625:186-nf] and that \"He was seen by himself last of all,\"[fn-106-P10609_2980693:187-nf] -by means, of course, of the light which was accessible, although it was not without imperilling his sight that he experienced that light.[fn-106-P10610_2980847:188-nf] A like danger to which also befell Peter, and John, and James, (who confronted not the same light) without risking the loss of their reason and mind; and if they, who were unable to endure the glory of the Son,[fn-106-P10611_2981080:189-nf] had only seen the Father, they must have died then and there: \"For no man shall see God, and live.\"[fn-106-P10612_2981214:190-nf] This being the case, it is evident that He was always seen from the beginning, who became visible in the end; and that He, (on the contrary, ) was not seen in the end who had never been visible from the beginning; and that accordingly there are two-the Visible and the Invisible. It was the Son, therefore, who was always seen, and the Son who always conversed with men, and the Son who has always worked by the authority and will of the Father; because \"the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do\"[fn-106-P10613_2981760:191-nf] -\"do\" that is, in His mind and thought.[fn-106-P10614_2981819:192-nf] For the Father acts by mind and thought; whilst the Son, who is in the Father's mind and thought,[fn-106-P10615_2981934:193-nf] gives effect and form to what He sees.

Suppose now that by some means Jesus were also called Vestitus (Clothed), as He is actually called Christ from the mystery of His anointing, would you in like manner say that Jesus was the Son of God, and at the same time suppose that Vestitus was the Father? Now then, concerning Christ, if Christ is the Father, the Father is an Anointed One, and receives the unction of course from another. Else if it is from Himself that He receives it, then you must prove it to us. But we learn no such fact from the Acts of the Apostles in that ejaculation of the Church to God, \"Of a truth, Lord, against Thy Holy Child Jesus, whom Thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the people of Israel were gathered together.\"[fn-108-P10857_3048785:396-nf] These then testified both that Jesus was the Son of God, and that being the Son, He was anointed by the Father. Christ therefore must be the same as Jesus who was anointed by the Father, and not the Father, who anointed the Son. To the same effect are the words of Peter: \"Let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ,\" that is, Anointed.[fn-108-P10858_3049223:397-nf] John, moreover, brands that man as \"a liar\" who \"denieth that Jesus is the Christ; \"whilst on the other hand he declares that \"every one is born of God who believeth that Jesus is the Christ.\"[fn-108-P10859_3049436:398-nf] Wherefore he also exhorts us to believe in the name of His (the Father's, ) Son Jesus Christ, that \"our fellowship may be with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.\"[fn-108-P10860_3049653:399-nf] Paul, in like manner, everywhere speaks of \"God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.\" When writing to the Romans, he gives thanks to God through our Lord Jesus Christ.[fn-108-P10861_3049843:400-nf] To the Galatians he declares himself to be \"an apostle not of men, neither by man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father.\"[fn-108-P10862_3049990:401-nf] You possess indeed all his writings, which testify plainly to the same effect, and set forth Two-God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father. (They also testify) that Jesus is Himself the Christ, and under one or the other designation the Son of God. For precisely by the same right as both names belong to the same Person, even the Son of God, does either name alone without the other belong to the same Person. Consequently, whether it be the name Jesus which occurs alone, Christ is also understood, because Jesus is the Anointed One; or if the name Christ is the only one given, then Jesus is identified with Him, because the Anointed One is Jesus. Now, of these two names Jesus Christ, the former is the proper one, which was given to Him by the angel; and the latter is only an adjunct, predicable of Him from His anointing,-thussuggesting the proviso that Christ must be the Son, not the Father. How blind, to be sure, is the man who fails to perceive that by the name of Christ some other God is implied, if he ascribes to the Father this name of Christ! For if Christ is God the Father, when He says, \"I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God,\"[fn-108-P10863_3051210:402-nf] He of course shows plainly enough that there is above Himself another Father and another God.

Moreover, a presumptuous confidence in baptism introduces all kind of vicious delay and tergiversation with regard to repentance; for, feeling sure of undoubted pardon of their sins, men meanwhile steal the intervening time, and make it for themselves into a holiday-time[fn-113-P11330_3212277:48-nf] for sinning, rather than a time for learning not to sin. Further, how inconsistent is it to expect pardon of sins (to be granted) to a repentance which they have not fulfilled! This is to hold out your hand for merchandise, but not produce the price. For repentance is the price at which the Lord has determined to award pardon: He proposes the redemption[fn-113-P11331_3212703:49-nf] of release from penalty at this compensating exchange of repentance. If, then, sellers first examine the coin with which they make their bargains, to see whether it be cut, or scraped, or adulterated,[fn-113-P11332_3212927:50-nf] we believe likewise that the Lord, when about to make us the grant of so costly merchandise, even of eternal life, first institutes a probation of our repentance. \"But meanwhile let us defer the reality of our repentance: it will then, I suppose, be clear that we are amended when we are absolved.\"[fn-113-P11333_3213259:51-nf] By no means; (but our amendment should be manifested) while, pardon being in abeyance, there is still a prospect of penalty; while the penitent does not yet merit-so far as merit we can-his liberation; while God is threatening, not while He is forgiving. For what slave, after his position has been changed by reception of freedom, charges himself with his (past) thefts and desertions? What soldier, after his discharge, makes satisfaction for his (former) brands? A sinner is bound to bemoan himself before receiving pardon, because the time of repentance is coincident with that of peril and of fear. Not that I deny that the divine benefit-the putting away of sins, I mean-is in every way sure to such as are on the point of entering the (baptismal) water; but what we have to labour for is, that it may be granted us to attain that blessing. For who will grant to you, a man of so faithless repentance, one single sprinkling of any water whatever? To approach it by stealth, indeed, and to get the minister appointed over this business misled by your asseverations, is easy; but God takes foresight for His own treasure, and suffers not the unworthy to steal a march upon it. What, in fact, does He say? \"Nothing hid which shall not be revealed.\"[fn-113-P11334_3214534:52-nf] Draw whatever (veil of) darkness you please over your deeds, \"God is light.\"[fn-113-P11335_3214631:53-nf] But some think as if God were under a necessity of bestowing even on the unworthy, what He has engaged (to give); and they turn His liberality into slavery. But if it is of necessity that God grants us the symbol of death,[fn-113-P11336_3214872:54-nf] then He does so unwilling. But who permits a gift to be permanently retained which he has granted unwillingly? For do not many afterward fall out of (grace)? is not this gift taken away from many? These, no doubt, are they who do steal a march upon (the treasure), who, after approaching to the faith of repentance, set up on the sands a house doomed to ruin. Let no one, then, flatter himself on the ground of being assigned to the \"recruit-classes\" of learners, as if on that account he have a licence even now to sin. As soon as you \"know the Lord,[fn-113-P11337_3215496:55-nf] you should fear Him; as soon as you have gazed on Him, you should reverence Him. But what difference does your \"knowing\" Him make, while you rest in the same practises as in days bygone, when you knew Him not? What, moreover, is it which distinguishes you from a perfected[fn-113-P11338_3215821:56-nf] servant of God? Is there one Christ for the baptized, another for the learners? Have they some different hope or reward? some different dread of judgment? some different necessity for repentance? That baptismal washing is a sealing of faith, which faith is begun and is commended by the faith of repentance. We are not washed in order that we may cease sinning, but because we have ceased, since in heart we have been bathed[fn-113-P11339_3216269:57-nf] already. For the first baptism of a learner is this, a perfect fear;[fn-113-P11340_3216382:58-nf] thenceforward, in so far as you have understanding of the Lord faith is sound, the conscience having once for all embraced repentance. Otherwise, if it is (only) after the baptismal waters that we cease sinning, it is of necessity, not of free-will, that we put on innocence. Who, then, is pro-eminent in goodness? he who is not allowed, or he whom it displeases, to be evil? he who is bidden, or he whose pleasure it is, to be free from crime? Let us, then, neither keep our hands from theft unless the hardness of bars withstand us, nor refrain our eyes from the concupiscence of fornication unless we be withdrawn by guardians of our persons, if no one who has surrendered himself to the Lord is to cease sinning unless he be bound thereto by baptism. But if any entertain this sentiment, I know not whether he, after baptism, do not feel more sadness to think that he has ceased from sinning, than gladness that he hath escaped from it. And so it is becoming that learners desire baptism, but do not hastily receive it: for he who desires it, honours it; he who hastily receives it, disdains it: in the one appears modesty, in the other arrogance; the former satisfies, the latter neglects it; the former covets to merit it, but the latter promises it to himself as a due return; the former takes, the latter usurps it. Whom would you judge worthier, except one who is more amended? whom more amended, except one who is more timid, and on that account has fulfilled the duty of true repentance? for he has feared to continue still in sin, lest he should not merit the reception of baptism. But the hasty receiver, inasmuch as he promised it himself (as his due), being forsooth secure (of obtaining it), could not fear: thus he fulfilled not repentance either, because he lacked the instrumental agent of repentance, that is, fear.[fn-113-P11341_3218238:59-nf] Hasty reception is the portion of irreverence; it inflates the seeker, it despises the Giver. And thus it sometimes deceives,[fn-113-P11342_3218376:60-nf] for it promises to itself the gift before it be due; whereby He who is to furnish the gift is ever offended.","title":"On Repentance.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_44_a_treatise_on_the_gift_of_perseverance_being_the_second_book","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"92","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"In the fifth sentence of the prayer we say, \"Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our\ndebtors,\"[fn-69-P6975_2665976:13-nf] in which petition alone\nperseverance is not found to be asked for.

For we do not say, as the heretics suppose, that some part of the substance of God was converted into the Son, or that the Son was procreated by the Father out of things non-existent,[fn-73-P7353_1683765:18-nf] i.e., beyond His own substance, so that there once was a time when He did not exist; but, putting away all corporeal conceptions, we say that the Word and Wisdom was begotten out of the invisible and incorporeal without any corporeal feeling, as if it were an act of the will proceeding from the understanding. Nor, seeing He is called the Son of (His) love, will it appear absurd if in this way He be called the Son of (His) will. Nay, John also indicates that \"God is Light,\"[fn-73-P7354_1684272:19-nf] and Paul also declares that the Son is the splendour of everlasting light.[fn-73-P7355_1684365:20-nf] As light, accordingly, could never exist without splendour, so neither can the Son be understood to exist without the Father; for He is called the \"express image of His person,\"[fn-73-P7356_1684564:21-nf] and the Word and Wisdom. How, then, can it be asserted that there once was a time when He was not the Son? For that is nothing else than to say that there was once a time when He was not the Truth, nor the Wisdom, nor the Life, although in all these He is judged to be the perfect essence of God the Father; for these things cannot be severed from Him, or even be separated from His essence. And although these qualities are said to be many in understanding,[fn-73-P7357_1685043:22-nf] yet in their nature and essence they are one, and in them is the fulness of divinity.

This Son of God, then, in respect of the Word being God, which was in the beginning with God, no one will logically suppose to be contained in any place; nor yet in respect of His being \"Wisdom,\" or \"Truth,\" or the \"Life,\" or \"Righteousness,\" or \"Sanctification,\" or \"Redemption: \"for all these properties do not require space to be able to act or to operate, but each one of them is to be understood as meaning those individuals who participate in His virtue and working.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_134_fragments_of_caius","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"ANF-05","text":"I. ...those things at which he was present he placed thus.[fn-100-P10003_3108034:23-nf] The third book of the Gospel, that according to Luke, the well-known physician Luke wrote in his own name[fn-100-P10004_3108455:24-nf] in order after the ascension of Christ, and when Paul had associated him with himself[fn-100-P10005_3108667:25-nf] as one studious of right.[fn-100-P10006_3108731:26-nf] Nor did he himself see the Lord in the flesh; and he, according as he was able to accomplish it, began[fn-100-P10007_3109038:27-nf] his narrative with the nativity of John.

For the old life is old age with all its dotage, but the new life is the infancy of regeneration. But what are we to do? The past sins are pardoned, not only to these but to us; and after the pardon and abolition of all sins, by living in this world in the midst of temptations, some haply have been contracted.

Where is the man that hath charity, if Paul and it not, who said, \"Our mouth is open unto you, O ye Corinthians, our heart is enlarged; ye are not straitened in us:\"[fn-43-P4372_2363545:22-nf] who said,\" I will myself be spent for your souls:\" and so great grace was in him, that it was manifested that he had charity. And yet we find that he asked and did not receive. What say we, brethren? It is a question: look attentively to God: it is a great question, this also. Just as, where it was said of sin, \"He that is born of God sinneth not:\" we found this sin to be the violating of charity, and that this was the thing strictly intended in that place: so too we ask now what it is that he would say. For if thou look but to the words, it seems plain: if thou take the examples into the account, it is obscure. Than the words here nothing can be plainer. \"And whatsoever we ask, we shall receive of Him, because we keep His commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.\" \"Whatsoever we ask,\" saith he, \"we shall receive of Him.\" He hath put us sorely to straits. In the other place also he would put us to straits, if he meant all sin: but then we found room to expound it in this, that he meant it of a certain sin, not of all sin; howbeit o[ a sin which \"whosoever is born of God committeth not:\" and we found that this same sin is none other than the violation of charity. We have also a manifest example from the Gospel, when the Lord saith, \"If I had not come, they had not had sin.\"[fn-43-P4373_2364900:23-nf] How? Were the Jews innocent when He came to them, because He so speaks? Then if He had not come, would they have had no sin? Then did the Physician's presence make one sick, not take away the fever? What madman even would say this? He came not but to cure and heal the sick. Therefore when He said, \"If I had not come, they had not had sin,\" what would He have to be understood, but a certain sin in particular? For there was a sin which the Jews would not have had. What sin? That they believed not on Him, that when he had come they despised Him. As then He there said \"sin,\" and it does not follow that we are to understand all sin, but a certain sin: so here also not all sin, lest it be contrary to that place where he saith, \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us:\"[fn-43-P4374_2365732:24-nf] but a certain sin in particular, that is, the violation of charity.

And as in a dream we fancy that we hear, and that the organs of hearing are actually impressed, and that we see with our eyes-although neither the bodily organs of sight nor hearing are affected, but it is the mind alone which has these sensations-so there is no absurdity in believing that similar things occurred to the prophets, when it is recorded that they witnessed occurrences of a rather wonderful kind, as when they either heard the words of the Lord or beheld the heavens opened. For I do not suppose that the visible heaven was actually opened, and its physical structure divided, in order that Ezekiel might be able to record such an occurrence. Should not, therefore, the same be believed of the Saviour by every intelligent hearer of the Gospels?-although such an occurrence may be a stumbling-block to the simple, who in their simplicity would set the whole world in movement, and split in sunder the compact and mighty body of the whole heavens. But he who examines such matters more profoundly will say, that there being, as the Scripture calls it, a kind of general divine perception which the blessed man alone knows how to discover, according to the saying of Solomon, \"Thou shall find the knowledge of God; \"[fn-78-P7862_1882781:79-nf] and as there are various forms of this perceptive power, such as a faculty of vision which can naturally see things that are better than bodies, among which are ranked the cherubim and seraphim; and a faculty of hearing which can perceive voices which have not their being in the air; and a sense of taste which can make use of living bread that has come down from heaven, and that giveth life unto the world; and so also a sense of smelling, which scents such things as leads Paul to say that he is a sweet savour of Christ unto God;[fn-78-P7863_1883339:80-nf] and a sense of touch, by which John says that he \"handled with his hands of the Word of life; \"[fn-78-P7864_1883459:81-nf] -the blessed prophets having discovered this divine perception, and seeing and hearing in this divine manner, and tasting likewise, and smelling, so to speak, with no sensible organs of perception, and laying hold on the Logos by faith, so that a healing effluence from it comes upon them, saw in this manner what they record as having seen, and heard what they say they heard, and were affected in a similar manner to what they describe when eating the roll of a book that was given them.[fn-78-P7865_1883971:82-nf] And so also Isaac smelled the savour of his son's divine garments,[fn-78-P7866_1884064:83-nf] and added to the spiritual blessing these words: \"See, the savour of my son is as the savour of a full field which the Lord blessed.\"[fn-78-P7867_1884254:84-nf] And similarly to this, and more as a matter to be understood by the mind than to be perceived by the senses, Jesus touched the leper,[fn-78-P7868_1884413:85-nf] to cleanse him, as I think, in a twofold sense,-freeing him not only, as the multitude heard, from the visible leprosy by visible contact, but also from that other leprosy, by His truly divine touch. It is in this way, accordingly, that John testifies when he says, \"I beheld the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon Him. And I knew Him not; but He that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, Upon whom you will see the Spirit descending, and abiding on Him, the same is He that baptizeth with the Holy Ghost And I saw, and bear witness, that this is the Son of God.\"[fn-78-P7869_1885042:86-nf] Now it was to Jesus that the heavens were opened; and on that occasion no one except John is recorded to have seen them opened. But with respect to this opening of the heavens, the Saviour, foretelling to His disciples that it would happen, and that they would see it, says, \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye shall see the heavens opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.\"[fn-78-P7870_1885476:87-nf] And so Paul was carried away into the third heaven, having previously seen it opened, since he was a disciple of Jesus. It does not, however, belong to our present object to explain why Paul says, \"Whether in the body, I know not; or whether out of the body, I know not: God knoweth.\"[fn-78-P7871_1885782:88-nf] But I shall add to my argument even those very points which Celsus imagines, viz., that Jesus Himself related the account of the opening of the heavens, and the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Him at the Jordan in the form of a dove, although the Scripture does not assert that He said that He saw it. For this great man did not perceive that it was not in keeping with Him who commanded His disciples on the occasion of the vision on the mount, \"Tell what ye have seen to no man, until the Son of man he risen from the dead,\"[fn-78-P7872_1886333:89-nf] to have related to His disciples what was seen and heard by John at the Jordan. For it may be observed as a trait of the character of Jesus, that He on all occasions avoided unnecessary talk about Himself; and on that account said, \"If I speak of Myself, My witness is not true.\"[fn-78-P7873_1886637:90-nf] And since He avoided unnecessary talk about Himself, and preferred to show by acts rather than words that He was the Christ, the Jews for that reason said to Him, \"If Thou art the Christ, tell us plainly.\"[fn-78-P7874_1886860:91-nf] And as it is a Jew who, in the work of Celsus, uses the language to Jesus regarding the appearance of the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove, \"This is your own testimony, unsupported save by one of those who were sharers of your punishment, whom you adduce,\" it is necessary for us to show him that such a statement is not appropriately placed in the mouth of a Jew. For the Jews do not connect John with Jesus, nor the punishment of John with that of Christ. And by this instance, this man who boasts of universal knowledge is convicted of not knowing what words he ought to ascribe to a Jew engaged in a disputation with Jesus.","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_56_of_patience_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"25","folder":"ANF-03","text":"And this species of the divine patience indeed being, as it were, at a distance, may perhaps be esteemed as among \"things too high for us; \"[fn-122-P12214_3417083:14-nf] but what is that which, in a certain way, has been grasped by hand[fn-122-P12215_3417254:15-nf] among men openly on the earth?

And so, too, He cursed for the time to come the works of the sword; and, by the restoration of health, made satisfaction to him whom Himself had not hurt, through Patience, the mother of Mercy. I pass by in silence (the fact) that He is crucified, for this was the end for which He had come; yet had the death which must be undergone need of contumelies likewise?[fn-122-P12218_3419620:18-nf] Nay, but, when about to depart, He wished to be sated with the pleasure of patience. He is spitted on, scourged, derided, clad foully, more foully crowned. Wondrous is the faith of equanimity! He who had set before Him the concealing of Himself in man's shape, imitated nought of man's impatience! Hence, even more than from any other trait, ought ye, Pharisees, to have recognised the Lord. Patience of this kind none of men would achieve. Such and so mighty evidences-the very magnitude of which proves to be among the nations indeed a cause for rejection of the faith, but among us its reason and rearing-proves manifestly enough (not by the sermons only, in enjoining, but likewise by the sufferings of the Lord in enduring) to them to whom it is given to believe, that as the effect and excellence of some inherent propriety, patience is God's nature.","title":"Of Patience.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":5,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_56_book_ii_","source_chapter":71,"source_paragraph":"230","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Jesus taught us who it was that sent Him, in the words, \"None knoweth the Father but the Son; \"[fn-84-P8406_2111772:189-nf] and in these, \"No man hath seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him.\"[fn-84-P8407_2111925:190-nf] He, treating of Deity, stated to His true disciples the doctrine regarding God; and we, discovering traces of such teaching in the Scripture narratives, take occasion from such to aid our theological conceptions,[fn-84-P8408_2112157:191-nf] hearing it declared in one passage, that \"God is light, and in Him there is no darkness at all; \"[fn-84-P8409_2112330:192-nf] and in another, \"God is a Spirit, and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth.\"[fn-84-P8410_2112452:193-nf] But the purposes for which the Father sent Him are innumerable; and these any one may ascertain who chooses, partly from the prophets who prophesied of Him, and partly from the narratives of the evangelists.

For when the prophet says, \"Open Thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law,\"[fn-110-P11022_2967394:76-nf] or, \"the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes,\"[fn-110-P11023_2967479:77-nf] or, \"Lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death,\"[fn-110-P11024_2967554:78-nf] no one is so foolish as to suppose that the eyes of the body behold the wonders of the divine law, or that the law of the Lord gives light to the bodily eyes, or that the sleep of death falls on the eyes of the body. When our Saviour says, \"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear,\"[fn-110-P11025_2967855:79-nf] any one will understand that the ears spoken of are of a diviner kind. When it is said that the word of the Lord was \"in the hand\" of Jeremiah or of some other prophet; or when the expression is used, \"the law by the hand of Moses,\" or, \"I sought the Lord with my hands, and was not deceived,[fn-110-P11026_2968168:80-nf] -no one is so foolish as not to see that the word \"hands\" is taken figuratively, as when John says, \"Our hands have handled the Word of life.\"[fn-110-P11027_2968353:81-nf] And if you wish further to learn from the sacred writings that there is a diviner sense than the senses of the body, you have only to hear what Solomon says, \"Thou shalt find a divine sense.\"[fn-110-P11028_2968563:82-nf] ","title":"Book VII.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_61_book_ii_","source_chapter":104,"source_paragraph":"449","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"241. Augustin answered: I seemed too a little while ago, when we were disputing about the oil of the sinner, to anoint your forehead, in order that you might say, if you dared, whether you yourself were not a sinner. You have had the hardihood to say as much. What a portentous sin! For in that you assert yourself to be a priest, what else have you maintained by quoting this testimony of the prophet, save that you are wholly without sin? For if you have sin, who is there that shall pray for you, according to your understanding of the words? For thus you blazon yourselves among the wretched people, quoting from the prophet: \"If the people shall sin, the priest shall pray for them: but if the priest shall sin, who will pray for him?[fn-54-P5499_2661755:334-nf] to the intent that they may believe you to be without sin, and entrust the wiping away their sins to your prayers. Truly ye are great men, exalted above your fellows, heavenly, godlike, angels indeed rather than men, who pray for the people, and will not have the people pray for you! Are you more righteous than Paul, more perfect than that great apostle, who was wont to commend himself to the prayers of those whom he taught? \"Continue,\" he says, \"in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving; withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds; that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.\"[fn-55-P5500_2662496:335-nf] See how prayer is made for an apostle, which you would have not made for a bishop. Do you perceive of how devilish a nature your pride is? Prayer is made for an apostle, that he may make manifest the mystery of Christ as he ought to speak. Accordingly, if you had a pious people under you, you ought to have exhorted them to pray for you, that you might not give utterance as you ought not. Are you more righteous than the evangelist John, who says, \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us?\"[fn-55-P5501_2663050:336-nf] Finally, are you more righteous than Daniel, whom you yourself quoted in this very epistle, going so far as to say, \"The most righteous king cast forth Daniel, as he supposed, to be devoured by wild beasts?\"-a thing which he never did suppose, since he said to Daniel himself, in the most friendly spirit, as the context of the lesson shows, \"Thy God, whom thou servest continually, He will deliver thee.\"[fn-55-P5502_2663476:337-nf] But on this subject we have already said much. With regard to the question now before us, viz., that Daniel was most righteous, it is proved not by your testimony, though that might be sufficient for me in the argument which I hold with you, but by the testimony of the Spirit of God, speaking also by the mouth of Ezekiel, where he named three men of most eminent righteousness, Noah, Daniel, and Job, who, he said, were the only men that could be saved from a certain excessive wrath of God, which was hanging over all the rest.[fn-55-P5503_2664027:338-nf] A man, therefore, of the highest righteousness, one of three conspicuous for righteousness, prays, and says, \"While I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin, and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God.\"[fn-55-P5504_2664306:339-nf] And you say that you are without sin, because forsooth you are a priest; and if the people sin, you pray for them: but if you sin, who shall pray for you? For clearly by the impiety of such arrogance you show yourself to be unworthy of the mediation of that Priest whom the prophet would have to be understood in these words, which you do not understand. For now that no one may ask why this was said, I will explain it so far as by God's grace I shall be able. God was preparing the minds of men, by His prophet, to desire a Priest of such a sort that none should pray for Him. He was Himself prefigured in the times of the first people and the first temple, in which all things were figures for our ensample. Therefore the high priest used to enter alone into the holy of holies, that he might make supplication for the people, which did not enter with the priest into that inner sanctuary;[fn-55-P5505_2665220:340-nf] just as our High Priest is entered into the secret places of the heavens, into that truer holy of holies, whilst we for whom He prays are still placed here.[fn-55-P5506_2665407:341-nf] It is with this reference that the prophet says, \"If the people shall sin, the priest shall pray for them: but if the priest shall sin, who will pray for him?\" Seek therefore a priest of such a kind that he cannot sin, nor need that one should pray for him. And for this reason prayer is made for the apostles by the people;[fn-55-P5507_2665762:342-nf] but for that Priest who is the Master and Lord of the apostles is prayer not made. Hear John confessing this, and saying, \"My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and He is the propitiation for our sins.\"[fn-55-P5508_2666101:343-nf] \"We have,\" he says; and \"for our sins.\" I pray you, learn humility, that you may not fall, or rather, that in time you may arise again.

But in this life, when the corruptible body presseth down the soul,[fn-60-P6014_2912120:77-nf] if their Church is already of such a character as they maintain, they would not utter unto God the prayer which our Lord has taught us to employ: \"Forgive us our debts.\"[fn-60-P6015_2912309:78-nf] For since all sins have been remitted in baptism, why does the Church make this petition, if already, even in this life, it has neither spot nor wrinkle, nor any such thing?

Of which fear and love the Lord in chiding some shows what is befitting for each one: \"A son knoweth his own father, and a servant feareth his lord: And if I be a Father, where is My honour: and if I be a Lord, where is my fear?\"[fn-51-P5163_1867256:19-nf] For one who is a servant must needs fear because \"if knowing his lord's will he has done things worthy of stripes, he shall be beaten with many stripes.\"[fn-51-P5164_1867426:20-nf] Whoever then by this love has attained the image and likeness of God, will now delight in goodness for the pleasure of goodness itself, and having somehow a like feeling of patience and gentleness will henceforth be angered by no faults of sinners, but in his compassion and sympathy will rather ask for pardon for their infirmities, and, remembering that for so long he himself was tried by the stings of similar passions till by the Lord's mercy he was saved, will feel that, as he was saved from carnal attacks not by the teaching of his own exertions but by God's protection, not anger but pity ought to be shown to those who go astray; and with full peace of mind will he sing to God the following verse: \"Thou hast broken my chains.

What is that \"wedding garment\" then?

It is not that these are nothing; but\" I,\" if I have them, \"and have not charity, am nothing.\"How many good things profit nothing without this one good thing! If then I have not charity, though I bestow alms freely upon the poor, though I have come to the confession of Christ's Name even unto blood and fire, these things may be done even through the love of glory, and so are vain. Because then they may be done even from the love of glory, and so be vain, and not through the rich charity of a godly affection, he names them all also in express terms, and do thou give ear to them; \"though I distribute all my goods for the use of the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\"[fn-48-P4859_2084327:27-nf] This then is \"the wedding garment.\" Question yourselves; if ye have it, ye may be without fear in the Feast of the Lord. In one and the same man there exist two things, charity and desire. Let charity be born in thee, if it be yet unborn, and if it be born, be it nourished, fostered, increased. But as to that desire, though in this life it cannot be utterly extinguished; \"for if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us;\"[fn-48-P4860_2084808:28-nf] but in so far as desire is in us, so far we are not without sin: let charity increase, desire decrease; that the one, that is, charity, may one day be perfected, and desire be consumed. Put on \"the wedding garment:\" you I address, who as yet have it not. Ye are already within, already do ye approach to the Feast, and I still have ye not yet the garment to do honour to the Bridegroom; \"Ye are yet seeking your own things, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.\"[fn-48-P4861_2085292:29-nf] For \"the wedding garment\" is taken in honour of the union, the union, that is, of the Bridegroom to the Bride. Ye know the Bridegroom; it is Christ. Ye know the Bride; it is the Church. Pay honour[fn-48-P4862_2085508:30-nf] to the Bride, pay honour to the Bridegroom. If ye pay due honour to them both, ye will be their children. Therefore in this make progress. Love the Lord, and so learn to love yourselves; that when by loving the Lord ye shall have loved yourselves, ye may securely love your neighbour as yourselves.

For either through ignorance, or forgetfulness, orthought, or word, or surprise, or necessity, orweakness of the flesh, or defilement in adream, we often fall every day either againstour will or voluntarily; offences for whichDavid also prays the Lord, and asks for purification and pardon, and says: \"Who canunderstand sins? from my secret ones cleanseme; and from those of others spare Thy servant;\" and the Apostle: \"For the goodwhich I would I do not, and the evil which Iwould not, that I do.\" For which also the same man exclaims with a sigh \"O wretchedman that I am! who shall deliver me fromthe body of this death?\"[fn-62-P6291_2247885:38-nf] For we slip intothese so easily as it were by a law of nature,that however carefully and guardedly we areon the lookout against them, we cannot altogether avoid them.

For it will not be enough for a man to have kept himself clear from those foul stains of sins which the Lord hates, unless he has also secured by purity of heart and perfect Apostolical love that sweet fragrance of virtue in which the Lord delights. Thus far Abbot Pinufius discoursed on the marks of satisfaction and the end of penitence.

Further because we admit that the discursive lightness of the human mind cannot get rid of these idle and empty things, we thus consequently confess with truth that we are not without sin. For with whatever care a man tries to keep his heart, he can never, owing to the resistance of the nature of the flesh, keep it according to the desire of his spirit. For however far the human mind may have advanced and progressed towards a finer purity of contemplation, so much the more will it see itself to be unclean, as it were in the mirror of its purity, because while the soul raises itself for a loftier vision and as it looks forth yearns for greater things than it performs, it is sure always to despise as inferior and worthless the things in which it is mixed up. Since a keener sight notices more; and a blameless life produces greater sorrow when found fault with; and amendment of life, and earnest striving after goodness multiplies groans and sighs. For no one can rest content with that stage to which he has advanced, and however much a man may be purified in mind, so much the more does he see himself to be foul, and find grounds for humiliation rather than for pride, and, however swiftly he may climb to greater heights, so much more does he see above him whither he is tending. Finally that chosen Apostle \"whom Jesus loved,\"[fn-66-P6655_2384703:61-nf] who lay on His bosom, uttered this saying as if from the heart of the Lord: \"If we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.\"[fn-66-P6656_2384884:62-nf] And so if when we say that we have no sin, we have not the truth, that is Christ, in us, what good do we do except to prove ourselves by this very, profession, criminals and wicked among sinners?","title":"XXIII.

But that the Son has no beginning of being, but before He was made man was ever with the Father, John makes clear in his first Epistle, writing thus: `That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the Word of Life; and the Life was manifested, and we have seen it; and we bear witness and declare unto you that Eternal Life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us[fn-72-P7236_2874805:113-nf] .' While he says here that `the Life,' not `became,' but `was with the Father,' in the end of his Epistle he says the Son is the Life, writing, `And we are in Him that is True, even in His Son, Jesus Christ; this is the True God and Eternal Life[fn-72-P7237_2875084:114-nf] .' But if the Son is the Life, and the Life was with the Father, and if the Son was with the Father, and the same Evangelist says, `And the Word was with God[fn-72-P7238_2875260:115-nf] ,' the Son must be the Word, which is ever with the Father. And as the `Son' is `Word,' so `God' must be `the Father.' Moreover, the Son, according to John, is not merely `God' but `True God;' for according to the same Evangelist, `And the Word was God;' and the Son said, `I am the Life[fn-72-P7239_2875566:116-nf] .' Therefore the Son is the Word and Life which is with the Father. And again, what is said in the same John, `The Only-begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father[fn-72-P7240_2875754:117-nf] ,' shews that the Son was ever. For whom John calls Son, Him David mentions in the Psalm as God's Hand[fn-72-P7241_2875875:118-nf] , saying, `Why stretchest Thou not forth Thy Right Hand out of Thy bosom[fn-72-P7242_2875969:119-nf] ?' Therefore if the Hand is in the bosom, and the Son in the bosom, the Son will be the Hand, and the Hand will be the Son, through whom the Father made all things; for it is written, `Thy Hand made all these things,' and `He led out His people with His Hand[fn-72-P7243_2876256:120-nf] ;' therefore through the Son. And if `this is the changing of the Right Hand of the Most Highest,' and again, `Unto the end, concerning the things that shall be changed, a song for My Well-beloved[fn-72-P7244_2876492:121-nf] ;' the Well-beloved then is the Hand that was changed; concerning whom the Divine Voice also says, `This is My Beloved Son.'

In which Man, after the resurrection also, when the doors were shut, we know of His coming to the whole band[fn-72-P7292_2892989:160-nf] of the Apostles, and dispersing all that was hard to believe in it by His words, `Handle Me and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see Me have[fn-72-P7293_2893163:161-nf] .' And He did not say, `This,' or `this Man which I have taken to Me,' but `Me.' Wherefore the Samosatene will gain no allowance, being refuted by so many arguments for the union of God the Word, nay by God the Word Himself, who now brings the news to all, and assures them by eating, and permitting to them that handling of Him which then took place. For certainly he who gives food to others, and they who give him, touch hands. For `they gave Him,' Scripture says, `a piece of a broiled fish and of an honey-comb, and' when He had `eaten before them, He took the remains and gave to them[fn-72-P7294_2893776:162-nf] ,' See now, though not as Thomas was allowed, yet by another way, He afforded to them full assurance, in being touched by them; but if you would now see the scars, learn from Thomas. `Reach hither thy hand and thrust it into My side, and reach hither thy finger and behold My hands[fn-72-P7295_2894105:163-nf] ;' so says God the Word, speaking of His own[fn-72-P7296_2894170:164-nf] side and hands, and of Himself as whole man and God together, first affording to the Saints even perception of the Word through the body[fn-72-P7297_2894333:165-nf] , as we may consider, by entering when the doors were shut; and next standing near them in the body and affording full assurance.

As elsewhere the same Prophet says: \"Truth has sprung from the earth and righteousness hath looked down from heaven,\"[fn-72-P7207_2625315:16-nf] that we may know that when the Son of God looked down from heaven (i.e., came and descended), righteousness was born of the flesh of the Virgin, no phantasm of a body, but the Truth: for He is the Truth, according to His own witness of Truth: \"I am the Truth and the life.\"[fn-72-P7208_2625610:17-nf] And so as we have proved in the earlier books that this Truth; viz., the Lord Jesus Christ, was God when born of the Virgin, let us now do as we determined to do in the book before this, and show that He who was to be born of the Virgin, was always declared to be God beforehand. And so the prophet Isaiah says, \"Cease ye from the man whose breath is in his nostrils, for it is He in whom he is reputed to be;\" or as it is more exactly and clearly in the Hebrew: \"for he is reputed high.\"[fn-72-P7209_2626158:18-nf] But by saying \"cease ye,\" a term which deprecates violence, he admirably denotes the disturbance of persecution. \"Cease ye,\" he says, \"from the man whose breath is in his nostrils, for he is reputed high.\" Does he not in one and the same sentence speak of the taking upon Him of the manhood, and the truth of His Godhead? \"Cease ye,\" he says, \"from the man whose breath is in his nostrils, for he is reputed high.\" Does he not, I ask you, seem plainly to address the Lord's persecutors, and to say, \"Cease ye from the man\" whom ye are persecuting, for this man is God: and though He appears in the lowliness of human flesh, yet He still continues in the high estate of Divine glory? But by saying \"Cease ye from the man whose breath is in his nostrils,\" he admirably showed His manhood, by the clearest tokens of a human body, and this fearlessly and confidently, as one who would as urgently assert the truth of His humanity as that of His Godhead, for this is the true and Catholic faith, to believe that the Lord Jesus Christ possessed the substance of a true body just as He possessed a true and perfect Divinity. Unless possibly you think that anything can be made out of the fact that he uses the word \"High\" instead of \"God\"; whereas it is the habit of holy Scripture to put \"High\" for \"God,\" as where the prophet says: \"the Most High uttered His voice and the earth was moved,\"[fn-72-P7210_2627569:19-nf] and \"Thou alone art Most High over all the earth.\"[fn-72-P7211_2627652:20-nf] Isaiah too, who says this: \"The High and lofty one who inhabit eth eternity\":[fn-72-P7212_2627751:21-nf] where we are clearly to understand that as he there puts Most High without adding the name of God, so here too he speaks of God by the name of Most High.

The first stage of liberty is to be free from crimes. Give heed, my brethren, give heed, that I may not by any means mislead your understanding as to the nature of that liberty at present, and what it will be. Sift any one soever of the highest integrity in this life, and however worthy he may already be of the name of upright, yet is he not without sin. Listen to Saint John himself, the author of the Gospel before us, when he says in his epistle, \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\"[fn-17-P1754_1112093:22-nf] He alone could say this who was \"free among the dead:\" of Him only could it be said, who knew no sin. It could be said only of Him, for He also \"was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.\"[fn-17-P1755_1112316:23-nf] He alone could say, \"Behold, the prince of this world cometh, and shall find nothing in me.\" Sift any one else, who is accounted righteous, yet is he not in all respects without sin; not even such as was Job, to whom the Lord bore such testimony, that the devil was filled with envy, and demanded that he should be tempted, and was himself defeated in the temptation, to the end that Job might be proved.[fn-17-P1756_1112739:24-nf] And he was proved for this reason, not that the certainty of his carrying off the conqueror's wreath was unknown to God, but that he might become known as an object of imitation to others. And what says Job himself? \"For who is clean? not even the infant whose life is but a day's span upon the earth.\"[fn-17-P1757_1113057:25-nf] But it is plain that many are called righteous without opposition, because the term is understood as meaning, free from crime; for in human affairs there is no just ground of complaint attaching to those who are free from criminal conduct. But crime is grievous sin, deserving in the highest measure to be denounced and condemned. Not, however, that God condemns certain sins, and justifies and praises certain others. He approves of none. He hates them all. As the physician dislikes the ailment of the ailing, and works by his healing measures to get the ailment removed and the ailing relieved; so God by his grace worketh in us, that sin may be consumed, and man made free. But when, you will be saying, is it consumed? If it is lessened, why is it not consumed? That is growing less in the life of those who are advancing onwards, which is consumed in the life of those who have attained to perfection.","title":"Tractate XLI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_81_sermon_lxiv_cxiv_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"4.

Then carrying palms, the tokens of victory, with flaming tapers, with sounding hymns, and with fragrant incense, celebrating the triumph of his heavenly victory, they laid down the sacred relics, and buried them in the cemetery which had been long ago constructed by him, where too from henceforth, and even to this day, miraculous virtues cease not to show themselves. Pious vows, forsooth, are received with a propitious hearing; the health of the impotent is restored; the expulsion of unclean spirits testifies to the martyr's merits. These gifts, O Lord Jesus, are Thine, whose wont it is thus magnificently to honour Thy martyrs after death: Thou who with the Father and the Holy Consubstantial Spirit livest and reignest for evermore. Amen. After this, how that wolf and framer of treachery, that is Arius, covered with a sheep's skin, entered into the Lord's fold to worry and torment it, or in what manner he was enabled to attain to the dignity of the priesthood, let us employ ourselves in relating in brief,[fn-43-P4307_1288377:36-nf] And this not to annoy those who ventured to recall to the threshing-floor of the Lord those tares of apostacy and contagion that had been winnowed out of the Church by a heavenly fan i for these are without doubt reckoned eminent for sanctity, but thinking it a light thing to believe so holy a a man, they transgressed the injunctions of the divine command. What then? Do we reprehend them? By no means, For as long as this corruptible body weighs s down, and this earthly habitation depresses the sense of our infirmity, many are easily deceived in their imaginations, and think that which is unjust to be just, that to be holy which is impure. The Gibeonites who, by the divine threatenings, were to be utterly destroyed, having one thing in their wishes and another in their voice and mien, were able quickly to deceive Joshua,[fn-43-P4308_1289282:37-nf] that just distributor of the land of promise. David[fn-43-P4309_1289354:38-nf] also, full of prophetic inspiration, when he had heard the words of the deceitful youth, although it was by the inscrutable and just judgment of God, yet acted very differently from what the true nature of the case required. What also can be more sublime than the apostles, who have not removed themselves from our infirmity? For one of them writes, \"In many things we offend all; \"[fn-43-P4310_1289820:39-nf] and another, \"If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\"[fn-43-P4311_1289929:40-nf] But when we repent of these, so much the more readily do we obtain pardon, when we have sinned not willingly, but through ignorance or frailty. And certainly offences of this sort come not of prevarication, but of the indulgence of compassion. But I leave to others to write an apology for this; let us pursue what is in hand.
