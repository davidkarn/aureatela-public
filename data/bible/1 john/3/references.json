Sufficient to itself is a name so inimical to God, a substance of crime so copious, which reaches forth so many branches, diffuses so many veins, that from this name, for the greatest part, is drawn the material of all the modes in which the expansiveness of idolatry has to be foreguarded against by us, since in manifold wise it subverts the servants of God; and this not only when unperceived, but also when cloaked over. Most men simply regard idolatry as to be interpreted in these senses alone, viz.: if one burn incense, or immolate a victim, or give a sacrificial banquet, or be bound to some sacred functions or priesthoods; just as if one were to regard adultery as to be accounted in kisses, and in embraces, and in actual fleshly contact; or murder as to be reckoned only in the shedding forth of blood, and in the actual taking away of life. But how far wider an extent the Lord assigns to those crimes we are sure: when He defines adultery to consist even in concupiscence,[fn-6-P620_270867:6-nf] \"if one shall have cast an eye lustfully on,\" and stirred his soul with immodest commotion; when He judges murder[fn-6-P621_270997:7-nf] to consist even in a word of curse or of reproach, and in every impulse of anger, and in the neglect of charity toward a brother just as John teaches,[fn-6-P622_271164:8-nf] that he who hates his brother is a murderer. Else, both the devil's ingenuity in malice, and God the Lord's in the Discipline by which He fortifies us against the devil's depths,[fn-6-P623_271363:9-nf] would have but limited scope, if we were judged only in such faults as even the heathen nations have decreed punishable. How will our \"righteousness abound above that of the Scribes and Pharisees,\" as the Lord has prescribed,[fn-6-P624_271606:10-nf] unless we shall have seen through the abundance of that adversary quality, that is, of unrighteousness? But if the head of unrighteousness is idolatry, the first point is, that we be fore-fortified against the abundance of idolatry, while we recognise it not only in its palpable manifestations.","title":"On Idolatry.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":3,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_07_book_i_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"40","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"17. For this contemplation is held forth to us as the end of all actions, and the everlasting fullness of joy. For \"we are the sons of God; and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is.\"[fn-2-P275_96558:73-nf] For that which He said to His servant Moses, \"I am that I am; thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel, I Am hath sent me to you;\"[fn-2-P276_96714:74-nf] this it is which we shall contemplate when we shall live in eternity. For so it is said, \"And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.\"[fn-2-P277_96933:75-nf] This shall be when the Lord shall have come, and \"shall have brought to light the hidden things of darkness;\"[fn-2-P278_97062:76-nf] when the darkness of this present mortality and corruption shall have passed away. Then will be our morning, which is spoken of in the Psalm, \"In the morning will I direct my prayer unto Thee, and will contemplate Thee.\"[fn-2-P279_97302:77-nf] Of this contemplation I understand it to be said, \"When He shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father;\" that is, when He shall have brought the just, over whom now, living by faith, the Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus, reigns, to the contemplation of God, even the Father. If herein I am foolish, let him who knows better correct me; to me at least the case seems as I have said.[fn-2-P280_97733:78-nf] For we shall not seek anything else, when we shall have come to the contemplation of Him. But that contemplation is not yet, so long as our joy is in hope. For \"hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it,\"[fn-2-P281_98566:79-nf] viz. \"as long as the King sitteth at His table.\"[fn-2-P282_98639:80-nf] Then will take place that which is written, \"In Thy presence is fullness of joy.\"[fn-2-P283_98739:81-nf] Nothing more than that joy will be required; because there will be nothing more than can be required. For the Father will be manifested to us, and that will suffice for us. And this much Philip had well understood, so that he said to the Lord, \"Show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.\" But he had not yet understood that he himself was able to say this very same thing in this way also: Lord, show Thyself to us, and it sufficeth us. For, that he might understand this, the Lord replied to him, \"Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father.\" But because He intended him, before he could see this, to live by faith, He went on to say, \"Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?\"[fn-2-P284_99533:82-nf] For \"while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: for we walk by faith, not by sight.\"[fn-2-P285_99661:83-nf] For contemplation is the recompense of faith, for which recompense our hearts are purified by faith; as it is written, \"Purifying their hearts by faith.\"[fn-2-P286_99836:84-nf] And that our hearts are to be purified for this contemplation, is proved above all by this text, \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\"[fn-2-P287_100007:85-nf] And that this is life eternal, God says in the Psalm, \"With long life will I satisfy him, and show him my salvation,\"[fn-2-P288_100142:86-nf] Whether, therefore, we hear, Show us the Son; or whether we hear, Show us the Father; it is even all one, since neither can be manifested without the other. For they are one, as He also Himself says, \"My Father and I are one.\"[fn-2-P289_100387:87-nf] Finally, on account of this very indivisibility, it suffices that sometimes the Father alone, or the Son alone, should be named, as hereafter to fill us with the joy of His countenance.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_07_book_i_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"60","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"31. He is \"good,\" according to that sight, according to which God appears to the pure in heart; for \"truly God is good unto Israel even to such as are of a clean heart.\"[fn-4-P410_146275:183-nf] But when the wicked shall see the Judge, He will not seem good to them; because they will not rejoice in their heart to see Him, but all \"kindreds of the earth shall then wail because of Him,\"[fn-4-P411_146490:184-nf] namely, as being reckoned in the number of all the wicked and unbelievers. On this account also He replied to him, who had called Him Good Master, when seeking advice of Him how he might attain eternal life, \"Why askest thou me about good?[fn-4-P412_146749:185-nf] there is none good but One, that is, God.\"[fn-4-P413_146927:186-nf] And yet the Lord Himself, in another place, calls man good: \"A good man,\" He says, \"out of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth forth good things: and an evil man, out of the evil treasure of his heart, bringeth forth evil things.\"[fn-4-P414_147184:187-nf] But because that man was seeking eternal life, and eternal life consists in that contemplation in which God is seen, not for punishment, but for everlasting joy; and because he did not understand with whom he was speaking, and thought Him to be only the Son of man:[fn-4-P415_147472:188-nf] Why, He says, askest thou me about good? that is, with respect to that form which thou seest, why askest thou about good, and callest me, according to what thou seest, Good Master? This is the form of the Son of man, the form which has been taken, the form that will appear in judgment, not only to the righteous, but also to the ungodly; and the sight of this form will not be for good to those who are wicked. But there is a sight of that form of mine, in which when I was, I thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but in order to take this form I emptied myself.[fn-4-P416_148519:189-nf] That one God, therefore, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, who will not appear, except for joy which cannot be taken away from the just; for which future joy he sighs, who says, \"One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord:\"[fn-4-P417_148895:190-nf] that one God, therefore, Himself, I say, is alone good, for this reason, that no one sees Him for sorrow and wailing, but only for salvation and true joy. If you understand me after this latter form, then I am good; but if according to that former only, then why askest thou me about good? If thou art amongthose who \"shall look upon Him whom they have pierced,\"[fn-4-P418_149279:191-nf] that very sight itself will be evil to them, because it will be penal. That after this meaning, then, the Lord said, \"Why askest thou me about good? there is none good but One, that is, God,\" is probable upon those proofs which I have alleged, because that sight of God, whereby we shall contemplate the substance of God unchangeable and invisible to human eyes (which is promised to the saints alone; which the Apostle Paul speaks of, as \"face to face;\"[fn-4-P419_149756:192-nf] and of which the Apostle John says, \"We shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is;\"[fn-4-P420_149871:193-nf] and of which it is said, \"One thing have I desired of the Lord, that I may behold the beauty of the Lord,\" and of which the Lord Himself says, \"I will both love him, and will manifest myself to him;\"[fn-4-P421_150093:194-nf] and on account of which alone we cleanse our hearts by faith, that we may be those \"pure in heart who are blessed for they shall see God:\"[fn-4-P422_150253:195-nf] and whatever else is spoken of that sight: which whosoever turns the eye of love to seek it, may find most copiously scattered through all the Scriptures),-that sight alone, I say, is our chief good, for the attaining of which we are directed to do whatever we do aright. But that sight of the Son of man which is foretold, when all nations shall be gathered before Him, and shall say to Him, \"Lord, when saw we Thee an hungered, or thirsty, etc.?\" will neither be a good to the ungodly, who shall be sent into everlasting fire, nor the chief good to the righteous. For He still goes on to call these to the kingdom which has been prepared for them from the foundation of the world. For, as He will say to those, \"Depart into everlasting fire;\" so to these,\" Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you.\" And as those will go into everlasting burning; so the righteous will go into life eternal. But what is life eternal, except \"that they may know Thee,\" He says, \"the One true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent?\"[fn-4-P423_151320:196-nf] but know Him now in that glory of which He says to the Father, \"Which I had with Thee before the world was.\"[fn-4-P424_151459:197-nf] For then He will deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father,[fn-4-P425_151547:198-nf] that the good servant may enter into the joy of his Lord,[fn-4-P426_151627:199-nf] and that He may hide those whom God keeps in the hiding of His countenance from the confusion of men, namely, of those men who shall then be confounded by hearing this sentence; of which evil hearing \"the righteous man shall not be afraid\"[fn-4-P427_151893:200-nf] if only he be kept in \"the tabernacle,\" that is, in the true faith of the Catholic Church, from \"the strife of tongues,\"[fn-4-P428_152034:201-nf] that is, from the sophistries of heretics. But if there is any other explanation of the words of the Lord, where He says, \"Why asketh thou me about good? there is none good, but One, that is, God;\" provided only that the substance of the Father be not therefore believed to be of greater goodness than that of the Son, according to which He is the Word by whom all things were made; and if there is nothing in it abhorrent from sound doctrine; let us securely use it, and not one explanation only, but as many as we are able to find. For so much the more powerfully are the heretics proved wrong, the more outlets are open for avoiding their snares. But let us now start afresh, and address ourselves to the consideration of that which still remains.

I believe that he wrote it for the purpose of recommending these books which he was about to write on Offices, in which cry books he testifies that nothing in the whole range of philosophy is better and more profitable than to give precepts for living.

For when he had said, on account of the love of God with which he was specially inflamed, \"If I have found grace in thy sight, show me now Thyself plainly, that I may find grace in Thy sight;\" he immediately subjoined, on account of the love also of his neighbor, \"And that I may know that this nation is Thy people.\" It is therefore that \"appearance\" which hurries away every rational soul with the desire of it, and the more ardently the more pure that soul is; and it is the more pure the more it rises to spiritual things; and it rises the more to spiritual things the more it dies to carnal things.

Instead of the three proofs from Holy Scripture which you said would satisfy you if I could produce them, behold I have given you seven. Who, then, will put up with the follies of Origen? I will not use a severer word and so make myself like him or his followers, who presume at the peril of their soul to assert dogmatically whatever first comes into their head, and to dictate to God, whereas they ought either to pray to Him or to learn the truth from Him. For some of them say that the image of God which Adam had previously received was lost when he sinned. Others surmise that the body which the Son of God was destined to take of Mary was the image of the Creator. Some identify this image with the soul, others with sensation, others with virtue. These make it baptism, those assert that it is in virtue of God's image that man exercises universal sway. Like drunkards in their cups, they ejaculate now this, now that, when they ought rather to have avoided so serious a risk, and to have obtained salvation by simple faith, not denying the words of God. To God they ought to have left the sure and exact knowledge of His own gift, and of the particular way in which He has created men in His image and after His likeness. Forsaking this course, they have involved themselves in many subtle questions, and through these they have been plunged into the mire of sin. But we, dearly beloved, believe the words of the Lord, and know that God's image remains in all men, and we leave it to Him to know in what respect man is created in His image. And let no one be deceived by that passage in the epistle of John, which some readers fail to understand, where he says: \"Now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall See Him as He is.\"[fn-18-P1856_455057:1301-nf] For this refers to the glory which is then to be revealed[fn-18-P1857_455139:1302-nf] to His saints; just as also in another place we read the words \"from glory to glory,\"[fn-18-P1858_455247:1303-nf] of which glory the saints have even in this world received an earnest and a small portion.

Hence, likewise, they refuse to believe that in infants original sin is remitted through baptism, for they contend that no such original sin exists at all in people by their birth.

For this too the Lord calls a regeneration,-though, of course, not such as occurs through baptism, but still a regeneration wherein that which is now begun in the spirit shall be brought to perfection also in the body. \"In the regeneration,\" says He, \"when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.\"[fn-8-P800_482277:48-nf] For however entire and full be the remission of sins in baptism, nevertheless, if there was wrought by it at once, an entire and full change of the man into his everlasting newness,-I do not mean change in his body, which is now most clearly tending evermore to the old corruption and to death, after which it is to be renewed into a total and true newness,-but, the body being excepted, if in the soul itself, which is the inner man, a perfect renewal was wrought in baptism, the apostle would not say: \"Even though our outward man perishes, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.\"[fn-8-P801_482884:49-nf] Now, undoubtedly, he who is still renewed day by day is not as yet wholly renewed; and in so far as he is not yet wholly renewed, he is still in his old state.

And yet made it was, since we were then actually saved; for \"He saved us by the laver of regeneration.\"[fn-8-P803_484070:51-nf] In another passage, however, he tells us how this took place. \"Not they only,\" says he, \"but ourselves also, which have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.

Yet no man must be led by their history to say, for instance, that drunkenness is not sin, although so good a man was overtaken by it; for we read that Noah was once drunk,[fn-8-P825_490752:64-nf] but God forbid that it should be thought that he was an habitual drunkard.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_12_book_ii_","source_chapter":56,"source_paragraph":"169","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But, inasmuch as there are not wanting persons of such character, just as we say in answer to those who raise this question, that those things are punishments of sins before remission, which after remission become contests and exercises of the righteous; so again to such persons as are similarly perplexed about the death of the body, our answer ought to be so drawn as to show both that we acknowledge it to have accrued because of sin, and that we are not discouraged by the punishment of sins having been bequeathed to us for an exercise of discipline, in order that our great fear of it may be overcome by us as we advance in holiness.

Wherefore it ought to surprise no one, either that the death of the body could not possibly have happened to man unless sin had been previously committed, since it was of this that it was to become the punishment; nor that after the remission of their sins it comes to the faithful, in order that in their triumphing over the fear of it, the fortitude of righteousness may be exercised.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_07_lecture_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"4.

The Apostle has described Jovinianus speaking with swelling cheeks and nicely balancing his inflated utterances, promising heavenly liberty, when he himself is the slave of vice and self-indulgence, a dog returning to his vomit. For although he boasts of being a monk, he has exchanged his dirty tunic, bare feet, common bread, and drink of water, for a snowy dress, sleek skin, honey-wine and dainty dishes, for the sauces of[fn-64-P6481_2007880:309-nf] Apicius and[fn-64-P6482_2007959:310-nf] Paxamus, for baths and rubbings, and for the cook-shops. Is it not clear that he prefers his belly to Christ, and thinks his ruddy complexion worth the kingdom of heaven? And yet that handsome monk so fat and sleek, and of bright appearance, who always walks with the air of a bridegroom, must either marry a wife if he is to show that virginity and marriage are equal: or if he does not marry one, it is useless for him to bandy words with us when his acts are on our side. And John agrees with this almost to the letter:[fn-64-P6483_2008584:311-nf] \"Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of this life, which is not of the Father, but is of the world.\" And, \"The world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever. A new commandment have I written unto you, which thing is true both in Christ and in you; because the darkness is passing away, and the true light already shineth.\" And again,[fn-64-P6484_2009176:312-nf] \"Beloved, now are we the children of God, and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be. But we know that, if he shall be manifested, we shall be like him: for we shall see him even as he is.

These are they who have not defiled themselves with women, for they continued virgins. These follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth: for they were redeemed from among men, first-fruits to God and to the Lamb, and in their mouth was found no guile, and they are without spot.\"[fn-64-P6488_2010399:316-nf] Out of each tribe, the tribe of Dan excepted, the place of which is taken by the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand virgins who have been sealed are spoken of as future believers, who have not defiled themselves with women. And that we may not suppose the reference to be to those who know not harlots, he immediately added: \"For they continued virgins.\" Whereby he shows that all who have not preserved their virginity, in comparison of pure and angelic chastity and of our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, are defiled.[fn-64-P6489_2010933:317-nf] \"These are they who sing a new song which no man can sing except him that is a virgin. These are first-fruits unto God and unto the Lamb, and are without blemish.\" If virgins are first-fruits, it follows that widows and the continent in marriage, come after the first-fruits, that is, are in the second and third rank: nor can a lost people be saved unless it offer such sacrifices of chastity to God, and with pure victims reconcile the spotless Lamb. It would be endless work to explain the Gospel mystery of the ten virgins, five of whom were wise and five foolish. All I say now is, that as mere virginity without other works does not save, so all works without virginity, purity, continence, chastity, are imperfect. And we shall not be hindered in the least from taking this view by the objection of our opponent that our Lord was at Cana of Galilee, and joined in the marriage festivities when He turned water into wine. I shall very briefly reply, that He Who was circumcised on the eighth day, and for Whom a pair of turtle-doves and two young pigeons were offered on the day of purification, like others before He suffered, shewed His approval of Jewish custom, that He might not seem to give His enemies just cause for putting Him to death on the pretext that He destroyed the law and condemned nature. And even this was done for our sakes. For by going once to a marriage, He taught that men should marry only once. Moreover, at that time it was possible to injure virginity if marriage were not placed next to it, and the purity of widowhood in the third rank. But now when heretics are condemning wedlock, and despise the ordinance of God, we gladly hear anything he[fn-64-P6490_2012650:318-nf] may say in praise of marriage.

We profess, in short, in our prayer, that we will grant remission to our debtors;[fn-13-P1331_362527:44-nf] but it is not becoming to distend further, on the ground of the authority of such Scriptures, the cable of contention with alternate pull into diverse directions; so that one (Scripture) may seem to draw tight, another to relax, the reins of discipline-in uncertainty, as it were,-and the latter to debase the remedial aid of repentance through lenity, the former to refuse it through austerity. Further: the authority of Scripture will stand within its own limits, without reciprocal opposition. The remedial aid of repentance is determined by its own conditions, without unlimited concession; and the causes of it themselves are anteriorly distinguished without confusion in the proposition. We agree that the causes of repentance are sins. These we divide into two issues: some will be remissible, some irremissible: in accordance wherewith it will be doubtful to no one that some deserve chastisement, some condemnation. Every sin is dischargeable either by pardon or else by penalty: by pardon as the result of chastisement, by penalty as the result of condemnation. Touching this difference, we have not only already premised certain antithetical passages of the Scriptures, on one hand retaining, on the other remitting, sins;[fn-13-P1332_363778:45-nf] but John, too, will teach us: \"If any knoweth his brother to be sinning a sin not unto death, he shall request, and life shall be given to him; \"because he is not \"sinning unto death,\" this will be remissible. \"(There) is a sin unto death; not for this do I say that any is to request\"[fn-13-P1333_364088:46-nf] -this will be irremissible. So, where there is the efficacious power of \"making request,\" there likewise is that of remission: where there is no (efficacious power) of \"making request,\" there equally is none of remission either. According to this difference of sins, the condition of repentance also is discriminated. There will be a condition which may possibly obtain pardon,-in the case, namely, of a remissible sin: there will be a condition which can by no means obtain it,-in the case, namely, of an irremissible sin. And it remains to examine specially, with regard to the position of adultery and fornication, to which class of sins they ought to be assigned.","title":"VII.

That it is so with the angels of light we piously believe; but that the fallen angels, who by their own default lost that light, did not enjoy this blessedness even before they sinned, reason bids us conclude. Yet if their life was of any duration before they fell, we must allow them a blessedness of some kind, though not that which is accompanied with foresight. Or, if it seems hard to believe that, when the angels were created, some were created in ignorance either of their perseverance or their fail, while others were most certainly assured of the eternity of their felicity,-if it is hard to believe that they were not all from the beginning on an equal footing, until these who are now evil did of their own will fall away from the light of goodness, certainly it is much harder to believe that the holy angels are now uncertain of their eternal blessedness, and do not know regarding themselves as much as we have been able to gather regarding them from the Holy Scriptures. For what catholic Christian does not know that no new devil will ever arise among the good angels, as he knows that this present devil will never again return into the fellowship of the good? For the truth in the gospel promises to the saints and the faithful that they will be equal to the angels of God; and it is also promised them that they will \"go away into life eternal.\"[fn-18-P1853_1060359:30-nf] But if we are certain that we shall never lapse from eternal felicity, while they are not certain, then we shall not be their equals, but their superiors. But as the truth never deceives, and as we shall be their equals, they must be certain of their blessedness. And because the evil angels could not be certain of that, since their blessedness was destined to come to an end, it follows either that the angels were unequal, or that, if equal, the good angels were assured of the eternity of their blessedness after the perdition of the others; unless, possibly, some one may say that the words of the Lord about the devil \"He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth,\"[fn-18-P1854_1061071:31-nf] are to be understood as if he was not only a murderer from the beginning of the human race, when man, whom he could kill by his deceit, was made, but also that he did not abide in the truth from the time of his own creation, and was accordingly never blessed with the holy angels, but refused to submit to his Creator, and proudly exulted as if in a private lordship of his own, and was thus deceived and deceiving. For the dominion of the Almighty cannot be eluded; and he who will not piously submit himself to things as they are, proudly feigns, and mocks himself with a state of things that does not exist; so that what the blessed Apostle John says thus becomes intelligible: \"The devil sinneth from the beginning,\"[fn-18-P1855_1061812:32-nf] -that is, from the time he was created he refused righteousness, which none but a will piously subject to God can enjoy. Whoever adopts this opinion at least disagrees with those heretics the Manichees, and with any other pestilential sect that may suppose that the devil has derived from some adverse evil principle a nature proper to himself. These persons are so befooled by error, that, although they acknowledge with ourselves the authority of the gospels, they do not notice that the Lord did not say, \"The devil was naturally a stranger to the truth,\" but \"The devil abode not in the truth,\" by which He meant us to understand that he had fallen from the truth, in which, if he had abode, he would have become a partaker of it, and have remained in blessedness along with the holy angels.[fn-18-P1856_1062628:33-nf] ","title":"Book XI","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_17_book_xi","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"70","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"As for what John says about the devil, \"The devil sinneth from the beginning\"[fn-18-P1864_1063912:35-nf] they[fn-18-P1865_1063938:36-nf] who suppose it is meant hereby that the devil was made with a sinful nature, misunderstand it; for if sin be natural, it is not sin at all. And how do they answer the prophetic proofs,-either what Isaiah says when he represents the devil under the person of the king of Babylon, \"How art thou fallen, O Lucifer, son of the morning!\"[fn-18-P1866_1064294:37-nf] or what Ezekiel says, \"Thou hast been in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering,\"[fn-18-P1867_1064420:38-nf] where it is meant that he was some time without sin; for a little after it is still more explicitly said, \"Thou wast perfect in thy ways?\" And if these passages cannot well be otherwise interpreted, we must understand by this one also, \"He abode not in the truth,\" that he was once in the truth, but did not remain in it. And from this passage.\" The devil sinneth from the beginning,\" it is not to be supposed that he sinned from the beginning of his created existence, but from the beginning of his sin, when by his pride he had once commenced to sin.

Now let us see what he says about the Holy Spirit. \"After Him, we believe,\" he says, \"on the Comforter, the Spirit of Truth.\" I think it will be plain to all who come across this passage what object he has in view in thus perverting the declaration of the faith delivered to us by the Lord, in his statements concerning the Son and the Father. Though this absurdity has already been exposed, I will nevertheless endeavour, in few words, to make plain the aim of his knavery. As in the former case, he avoided using the name \"Father,\" that so he might not include the Son in the eternity of the Father, so he avoided employing the title Son, that he might not by it suggest His natural affinity to the Father; so here, too, he refrains from saying \"Holy Spirit,\" that he may not by this name acknowledge the majesty of His glory, and His complete union with the Father and the Son. For since the appellation of \"Spirit,\" and that of \"Holy,\" are by the Scriptures equally applied to the Father and the Son (for \"God is a Spirits[fn-12-P1225_665183:210-nf] ,\" and \"the anointed Lord is the Spirit before our face[fn-12-P1226_665262:211-nf] ,\" and \"the Lord our God is Holy[fn-12-P1227_665326:212-nf] ,\" and there is \"one Holy, one Lord Jesus Christ[fn-12-P1228_665395:213-nf] \") lest there should, by the use of these terms, be bred in the minds of his readers some orthodox conception of the Holy Spirit, such as would naturally arise in them from His sharing His glorious appellation with the Father and the Son, for this reason, deluding the ears of the foolish, he changes the words of the Faith as set forth by God in the delivery of this mystery, making a way, so to speak, by this sequence, for the entrance of his impiety against the Holy Spirit. For if he had said, \"We believe in the Holy Spirit,\" and \"God is a Spirit,\" any one instructed in things divine would have interposed the remark, that if we are to believe in the Holy Spirit, while God is called a Spirit, He is assuredly not distinct in nature from that which receives the same titles in a proper sense. For of all those things which are indicated not unreally, nor metaphorically, but properly and absolutely, by the same names, we are necessarily compelled to acknowledge that the nature also, which is signified by this identity of names, is one and the same. For this reason it is that, suppressing the name appointed by the Lord in the formula of the faith, he says, \"We believe in the Comforter.\" But I have been taught that this very name is also applied by the inspired Scripture to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost alike. For the Son gives the name of \"Comforter\" equally to Himself and to the Holy Spirit[fn-12-P1229_666903:214-nf] ; and the Father, where He is said to work comfort, surely claims as His own the name of \"Comforter.\" For assuredly he Who does the work of a Comforter does not disdain the name belonging to the work: for David says to the Father, \"Thou, Lord, hast holpen me and comforted me[fn-12-P1230_667203:215-nf] ,\" and the great Apostle applies to the Father the same language, when he says, \"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who comforteth us in all our tribulation[fn-12-P1231_667403:216-nf] \"; and John, in one of his Catholic Epistles, expressly gives to the Son the name of Comforter[fn-12-P1232_667520:217-nf] . Nay, more, the Lord Himself, in saying that another Comforter would be sent us, when speaking of the Spirit, clearly asserted this title of Himself in the first place. But as there are two senses of the parakalein[fn-12-P1233_667807:218-nf] ,-one to beseech, by words and gestures of respect, to induce him to whom we apply for anything, to feel with us in respect of those things for which we apply,-the other to comfort, to take remedial thought for affections of body and soul,-the Holy Scripture affirms the conception of the Paraclete, in either sense alike, to belong to the Divine nature. For at one time Paul sets before us by the word parakalein the healing power of God, as when he says, \"God, Who comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus[fn-12-P1234_668424:219-nf] \"; and at another time he uses this word in its other meaning, when he says, writing to the Corinthians, \"Now we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God[fn-12-P1235_668680:220-nf] .\" Now since these things are so, in whatever way you understand the title \"Paraclete,\" when used of the Spirit, you will not in either of its significations detach Him from His community in it with the Father and the Son. Accordingly, he has not been able, even though he wished it, to belittle the glory of the Spirit by ascribing to Him the very attribute which Holy Scripture refers also to the Father and to the Son. But in styling Him \"the Spirit of Truth,\" Eunomius' own wish, I suppose, was to suggest by this phrase subjection, since Christ is the Truth, and he called Him the Spirit of Truth, as if one should say that He is a possession and chattel of the Truth, without being aware that God is called a God of righteousness[fn-12-P1236_669437:221-nf] ; and we certainly do not understand thereby that God is a possession of righteousness. Wherefore also, when we hear of the \"Spirit of Truth,\" we acquire by that phrase such a conception as befits the Deity, being guided to the loftier interpretation by the words which follow it. For when the Lord said \"The Spirit of Truth,\" He immediately added \"Which proceedeth from the Father[fn-12-P1237_669966:222-nf] ,\" a fact which the voice of the Lord never asserted of any conceivable thing in creation, not of aught visible or invisible, not of thrones, principalities, powers, or dominions, nor of any other name that is named either in this world or in that which is to come. It is plain then that that, from share in which all creation is excluded, is something special and peculiar to uncreated being. But this man bids us believe in \"the Guide of godliness.\" Let a man then believe in Paul, and Barnabas, and Titus, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, and all those by whom we have been led into the way of thefaith. For if we are to believe in \"that which guides us to godliness,\" along with the Father and the Son, all the prophets and lawgivers and patriarchs, heralds, evangelists, apostles, pastors,and teachers, have equal honour with the Holy Spirit, as they bare been \"guides to godliness\" to those who came after them. \"Who came into being,\" he goes on, \"by the only God through the Only-begotten.\" In these words he gathers up in one head all his blasphemy. Once more he calls the Father \"only God,\" who employs the Only-begotten as an instrument for the production of the Spirit.

Who knows not that utterance of the Lord which tells us that they who are born of the Spirit are the children of God? For thus He expressly ascribes the birth of the children of God to the Spirit, saying, that as that which is born of the flesh is flesh, so that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. But as many as are born of the Spirit are called the children of God[fn-12-P1238_672086:223-nf] .

Hence when David says, \"they provoked God in the wilderness, and grieved Him in the desert[fn-12-P1244_673719:229-nf] ,\" the apostle refers to the Holy Spirit the despite done by the Israelites to God, in these terms: \"Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith, Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness; when your fathers tempted me[fn-12-P1245_674004:230-nf] ,\" and goes on to refer all that the prophecy refers to God, to the Person of the Holy Ghost.

Though this absurdity has already been exposed, I will nevertheless endeavour, in few words, to make plain the aim of his knavery. As in the former case, he avoided using the name \"Father,\" that so he might not include the Son in the eternity of the Father, so he avoided employing the title Son, that he might not by it suggest His natural affinity to the Father; so here, too, he refrains from saying \"Holy Spirit,\" that he may not by this name acknowledge the majesty of His glory, and His complete union with the Father and the Son. For since the appellation of \"Spirit,\" and that of \"Holy,\" are by the Scriptures equally applied to the Father and the Son (for \"God is a Spirits[fn-12-P1225_665183:210-nf] ,\" and \"the anointed Lord is the Spirit before our face[fn-12-P1226_665262:211-nf] ,\" and \"the Lord our God is Holy[fn-12-P1227_665326:212-nf] ,\" and there is \"one Holy, one Lord Jesus Christ[fn-12-P1228_665395:213-nf] \") lest there should, by the use of these terms, be bred in the minds of his readers some orthodox conception of the Holy Spirit, such as would naturally arise in them from His sharing His glorious appellation with the Father and the Son, for this reason, deluding the ears of the foolish, he changes the words of the Faith as set forth by God in the delivery of this mystery, making a way, so to speak, by this sequence, for the entrance of his impiety against the Holy Spirit. For if he had said, \"We believe in the Holy Spirit,\" and \"God is a Spirit,\" any one instructed in things divine would have interposed the remark, that if we are to believe in the Holy Spirit, while God is called a Spirit, He is assuredly not distinct in nature from that which receives the same titles in a proper sense. For of all those things which are indicated not unreally, nor metaphorically, but properly and absolutely, by the same names, we are necessarily compelled to acknowledge that the nature also, which is signified by this identity of names, is one and the same. For this reason it is that, suppressing the name appointed by the Lord in the formula of the faith, he says, \"We believe in the Comforter.\" But I have been taught that this very name is also applied by the inspired Scripture to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost alike. For the Son gives the name of \"Comforter\" equally to Himself and to the Holy Spirit[fn-12-P1229_666903:214-nf] ; and the Father, where He is said to work comfort, surely claims as His own the name of \"Comforter.\" For assuredly he Who does the work of a Comforter does not disdain the name belonging to the work: for David says to the Father, \"Thou, Lord, hast holpen me and comforted me[fn-12-P1230_667203:215-nf] ,\" and the great Apostle applies to the Father the same language, when he says, \"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who comforteth us in all our tribulation[fn-12-P1231_667403:216-nf] \"; and John, in one of his Catholic Epistles, expressly gives to the Son the name of Comforter[fn-12-P1232_667520:217-nf] . Nay, more, the Lord Himself, in saying that another Comforter would be sent us, when speaking of the Spirit, clearly asserted this title of Himself in the first place. But as there are two senses of the parakalein[fn-12-P1233_667807:218-nf] ,-one to beseech, by words and gestures of respect, to induce him to whom we apply for anything, to feel with us in respect of those things for which we apply,-the other to comfort, to take remedial thought for affections of body and soul,-the Holy Scripture affirms the conception of the Paraclete, in either sense alike, to belong to the Divine nature. For at one time Paul sets before us by the word parakalein the healing power of God, as when he says, \"God, Who comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus[fn-12-P1234_668424:219-nf] \"; and at another time he uses this word in its other meaning, when he says, writing to the Corinthians, \"Now we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God[fn-12-P1235_668680:220-nf] .\" Now since these things are so, in whatever way you understand the title \"Paraclete,\" when used of the Spirit, you will not in either of its significations detach Him from His community in it with the Father and the Son. Accordingly, he has not been able, even though he wished it, to belittle the glory of the Spirit by ascribing to Him the very attribute which Holy Scripture refers also to the Father and to the Son. But in styling Him \"the Spirit of Truth,\" Eunomius' own wish, I suppose, was to suggest by this phrase subjection, since Christ is the Truth, and he called Him the Spirit of Truth, as if one should say that He is a possession and chattel of the Truth, without being aware that God is called a God of righteousness[fn-12-P1236_669437:221-nf] ; and we certainly do not understand thereby that God is a possession of righteousness. Wherefore also, when we hear of the \"Spirit of Truth,\" we acquire by that phrase such a conception as befits the Deity, being guided to the loftier interpretation by the words which follow it. For when the Lord said \"The Spirit of Truth,\" He immediately added \"Which proceedeth from the Father[fn-12-P1237_669966:222-nf] ,\" a fact which the voice of the Lord never asserted of any conceivable thing in creation, not of aught visible or invisible, not of thrones, principalities, powers, or dominions, nor of any other name that is named either in this world or in that which is to come. It is plain then that that, from share in which all creation is excluded, is something special and peculiar to uncreated being. But this man bids us believe in \"the Guide of godliness.\" Let a man then believe in Paul, and Barnabas, and Titus, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, and all those by whom we have been led into the way of thefaith.

And there, accordingly, we find the only end that is satisfying to ourselves. He will therefore be eternal; for no end can satisfy us, save that which is found in Him who is endless.

Indeed, those men who say that there is no such directing faculty, have begun by supposing that the soul itself is simply a nonentity. One Dicµarchus, a Messenian, and amongst the medical profession Andreas and Asclepiades, have thus destroyed the (soul's) directing power, by actually placing in the mind the senses, for which they claim the ruling faculty. Asclepiades rides rough-shod over us with even this argument, that very many animals, after losing those parts of their body in which the soul's principle of vitality and sensation is thought mainly to exist, still retain life in a considerable degree, as well as sensation: as in the case of flies, and wasps, and locusts, when you have cut off their heads; and of she-goats, and tortoises, and eels, when you have pulled out their hearts. (He concludes), therefore, that there is no especial principle or power of the soul; for if there were, the soul's vigour and strength could not continue when it was removed with its domiciles (or corporeal organs). However, Dicµarchus has several authorities against him-and philosophers too-Plato, Strato, Epicurus, Democritus, Empedocles, Socrates, Aristotle; whilst in opposition to Andreas and Asclepiades (may be placed their brother) physicians Herophilus, Erasistratus, Diocles, Hippocrates, and Soranus himself; and better than all others, there are our Christian authorities. We are taught by God concerning both these questions-viz. that there is a ruling power in the soul, and that it is enshrined[fn-27-P2706_907462:96-nf] in one particular recess of the body. For, when one reads of God as being \"the searcher and witness of the heart; \"[fn-27-P2707_907596:97-nf] when His prophet is reproved by His discovering to him the secrets of the heart;[fn-27-P2708_907694:98-nf] when God Himself anticipates in His people the thoughts of their heart,[fn-27-P2709_907787:99-nf] \"Why think ye evil in your hearts? \"[fn-27-P2710_907846:100-nf] when David prays \"Create in me a clean heart, O God,\"[fn-27-P2711_907920:101-nf] and Paul declares, \"With the heart man believeth unto righteousness,\"[fn-27-P2712_908009:102-nf] and John says, \"By his own heart is each man condemned; \"[fn-27-P2713_908086:103-nf] when, lastly, \"he who looketh on a woman so as to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart,\"[fn-27-P2714_908231:104-nf] -then both points are cleared fully up, that there is a directing faculty of the soul, with which the purpose of God may agree; in other words, a supreme principle of intelligence and vitality (for where there is intelligence, there must be vitality), and that it resides in that most precious part[fn-27-P2715_908550:105-nf] of our body to which God especially looks: so that you must not suppose, with Heraclitus, that this sovereign faculty of which we are treating is moved by some external force; nor with Moschion,[fn-27-P2716_908768:106-nf] that it floats about through the whole body; nor with Plato, that it is enclosed in the head; nor with Zenophanes, that it culminates in the crown of the head; nor that it reposes in the brain, according to the opinion of Hippocrates; nor around the basis of the brain, as Herophilus thought; nor in the membranes thereof, as Strato and Erasistratus said; nor in the space between the eyebrows, as Strato the physician held; nor within the enclosure[fn-27-P2717_909327:107-nf] of the breast, according to Epicurus: but rather, as the Egyptians have always taught, especially such of them as were accounted the expounders of sacred truths;[fn-27-P2718_909504:108-nf] in accordance, too, with that verse of Orpheus or Empedocles:","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":3,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_107_tractate_cii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"3. \"These things,\" said He, \"have I spoken to you in proverbs: but the hour cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall show you plainly of my Father.\" I might be disposed to say that this hour, whereof He speaketh, must be understood as that future period when we shall see openly, as the blessed Paul says, \"face to face;\" that what He says, \"These things have I spoken to you in proverbs,\" is one with what has been said by the same apostle, \"Now we see through a glass, in a riddle:\"[fn-33-P3376_1871998:4-nf] and \"I will show you,\" because the Father shall be seen through the instrumentality of the Son, is akin to what He says elsewhere, \"Neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and [he] to whom the Son shall be pleased to reveal Him.\"[fn-33-P3377_1872259:5-nf] But such a sense seems to be interfered with by that which follows: \"At that day ye shall ask in my name.\" For in that future world, when we have reached the kingdom where we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is,[fn-33-P3378_1872501:6-nf] what shall we then have to ask, when our desire shall be satisfied with good things?[fn-33-P3379_1872605:7-nf] As it is also said in another psalm: \"I shall be satisfied when Thy glory shall be revealed.\"[fn-33-P3380_1872715:8-nf] For petition has to do with some kind of want, which can have no place there where such abundance shall reign.","title":"Tractate CII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_13_book_i_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"125","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"98.

The teaching of the apostles was surely in everything according to the mind of God: they forgot and omitted nothing of the Gospel. Where, then, do you show that they renewed the command to flee from city to city? In fact, it was utterly impossible that they should have laid down anything so utterly opposed to their own examples as a command to flee, while it was just from bonds, or the islands in which, for confessing, not fleeing from the Christian name, they were confined, they wrote their letters to the Churches. Paul[fn-19-P1974_594332:34-nf] bids us support the weak, but most certainly it is not when they flee. For how can the absent be supported by you? By bearing with them? Well, he says that people must be supported, if anywhere they have committed a fault through the weakness of their faith, just as (he enjoins) that we should comfort the faint-hearted; he does not say, however, that they should be sent into exile. But when he urges us not to give place to evil,[fn-19-P1975_594786:35-nf] he does not offer the suggestion that we should take to our heels, he only teaches that passion should be kept under restraint; and if he says that the time must be redeemed, because the days are evil,[fn-19-P1976_595006:36-nf] he wishes us to gain a lengthening of life, not by flight, but by wisdom. Besides, he who bids us shine as sons of light,[fn-19-P1977_595145:37-nf] does not bid us hide away out of sight as sons of darkness. He commands us to stand stedfast,[fn-19-P1978_595259:38-nf] certainly not to act an opposite. part by fleeing; and to be girt, not to play the fugitive or oppose the Gospel. He points out weapons, too, which persons who intend to run away would not require. And among these he notes the shield[fn-19-P1979_595513:39-nf] too, that ye may be able to quench the darts of the devil, when doubtless ye resist him, and sustain his assaults in their utmost force. Accordingly John also teaches that we must lay down our lives for the brethren;[fn-19-P1980_595748:40-nf] much more, then, we must do it for the Lord. This cannot be fulfilled by those who flee. Finally, mindful of his own Revelation, in which he had heard the doom of the fearful, (and so) speaking from personal knowledge, he warns us that fear must be put away. \"There is no fear,\" says he, \"in love; but perfect love casteth out fear; because fear has torment\"-the fire of the lake, no doubt. \"He that feareth is not perfect in love\"[fn-19-P1981_596201:41-nf] -to wit, the love of God. And yet who will flee from persecution, but he who fears? Who will fear, but he who has not loved? Yes; and if you ask counsel of the Spirit, what does He approve more than that utterance of the Spirit? For, indeed, it incites all almost to go and offer themselves in martyrdom, not to flee from it; so that we also make mention of it. If you are exposed to public infamy, says he, it is for your good; for he who is not exposed to dishonour among men is sure to be so before the Lord. Do not be ashamed; righteousness brings you forth into the public gaze. Why should you be ashamed of gaining glory? The opportunity is given you when you are before the eyes of men. So also elsewhere: seek not to die on bridal beds, nor in miscarriages, nor in soft fevers, but to die the martyr's death, that He may be glorified who has suffered for you.","title":"IX.

How, indeed, can this word fail to contradict the very defence and answer which Pelagius made; since the Bishop John asserted that Pelagius put in this answer in his presence, that \"he wished it to be understood that the man who was willing to labour and agonize for his salvation was able to avoid sin,\" while Pelagius himself, at this time engaged in a formal inquiry anti conducting his defence,[fn-31-P3118_1209362:148-nf] said, that \"it was by his own labour and the grace of God that a man is able to be without sin?\" Now, is a thing easy when labour is required to effect it? For I suppose that every man would agree with us in the opinion, that wherever there is labour there cannot be facility. And yet a carnal epistle of windiness and inflation flies forth, and, outrunning in speed the tardy record of the proceedings, gets first into men's hands; so as to assert that fourteen bishops in the East have determined, not only \"that a man is able to be without sin, and to keep God's commandments,\" but \"easily to keep.\" Nor is God's assistance once named: it is merely said, \"If he wishes;\" so that, of course, as nothing is affirmed of the divine grace, for which the earnest fight was made, it remains that the only thing one reads of in this epistle is the unhappy and self-deceiving-because represented as victorious-human pride. As if the Bishop John, indeed, had not expressly declared that he censured this statement, and that, by the help of three inspired texts of Scripture,[fn-31-P3119_1210564:149-nf] he had, as if by thunderbolts, struck to the ground the gigantic mountains of such presumption which they had piled up against the still over-towering heights of heavenly grace; or as if again those other bishops who were John's assessors could have borne with Pelagius, either in mind or even in ear, when he pronounced these words: \"We said that a man is able to be without sin and to keep the commandments of God, if he wishes,\" unless he had gone on at once to say: \"For the ability to do this God has given to him\" (for they were unaware that he was speaking of nature, and not of that grace which they had learnt from the teaching of the apostle); and had afterwards added this qualification: \"We never said, however, that any man could be found, who at no time whatever from his infancy to his old age had committed sin, but that if any person were converted from his sins, he could by his own exertion and the grace of God be without sin.\" Now, by the very fact that in their sentence they used these words, \"he has answered correctly,'that a man can, when he has the assistance and grace of God, be without sin;'\" what else did they fear than that, if he denied this, he would be doing a manifest wrong not to man's ability, but to God's grace? It has indeed not been defined when a man may become without sin; it has only been judicially settled, that this result can only be reached by the assisting grace of God; it has not, I say, been defined whether a man, whilst he is in this flesh which lusts against the Spirit, ever has been, or now is, or ever can be, by his present use of reason and free will, either in the full society of man or in monastic solitude, in such a state as to be beyond the necessity of offering up the prayer, not in behalf of others, but for himself personally: \"Forgive us our debts;\"[fn-31-P3120_1212412:150-nf] or whether this gift shall be consummated at the time when \"we shall be like Him, when we shall see Him as He is,\"[fn-31-P3121_1212548:151-nf] -when it shall be said, not by those that are fighting: \"I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind,\"[fn-31-P3122_1212697:152-nf] but by those that are triumphing: \"O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?\"[fn-31-P3123_1212814:153-nf] Now, this is perhaps hardly a question which ought to be discussed between catholics and heretics, but only among catholics with a view to a peaceful settlement.[fn-31-P3124_1212998:154-nf] ","title":"On the Proceedings of Pelagius,","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_21_book_xv","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"45","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"But though God made use of this very mode of address which we have been endeavoring to explain, and spoke to Cain in that form by which He was wont to accommodate Himself to our first parents and converse with them as a companion, what good influence had it on Cain? Did he not fulfill his wicked intention of killing his brother even after he was warned by God's voice? For when God had made a distinction between their sacrifices, neglecting Cain's, regarding Abel's, which was doubtless intimated by some visible sign to that effect; and when God had done so because the works of the one were evil but those of his brother good, Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. For thus it is written: \"And the Lord said unto Cain, Why are thou wroth, and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou offerest rightly, but dost not rightly distinguish, hast thou not sinned? Fret not thyself, for unto thee shall be his turning, and thou shalt rule over him.\"[fn-25-P2570_1426916:19-nf] In this admonition administered by God to Cain, that clause indeed, \"If thou offerest rightly, but dost not rightly distinguish, hast thou not sinned?\" is obscure, inasmuch as it is not apparent for what reason or purpose it was spoken, and many meanings have been put upon it, as each one who discusses it attempts to interpret it according to the rule of faith. The truth is, that a sacrifice is \"rightly offered\" when it is offered to the true God, to whom alone we must sacrifice. And it is \"not rightly distinguished\" when we do not rightly distinguish the places or seasons or materials of the offering, or the person offering, or the person to whom it is presented, or those to whom it is distributed for food after the oblation. Distinguishing[fn-25-P2571_1427688:20-nf] is here used for discriminating,-whether when an offering is made in a place where it ought not or of a material which ought to be offered not there but elsewhere; or when an offering is made at a wrong time, or of a material suitable not then but at some other time; or when that is offered which in no place nor any time ought to be offered; or when a man keeps to himself choicer specimens of the same kind than he offers to God; or when he or any other who may not lawfully partake profanely eats of the oblation. In which of these particulars Cain displeased God, it is difficult to determine. But the Apostle John, speaking of these brothers, says, \"Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.\"[fn-25-P2572_1428525:21-nf] He thus gives us to understand that God did not respect his offering because it was not rightly \"distinguished\" in this, that he gave to God something of his own but kept himself to himself. For this all do who follow not God's will but their own, who live not with an upright but a crooked heart, and yet offer to God such gifts as they suppose will procure from Him that He aid them not by healing but by gratifying their evil passions. And this is the characteristic of the earthly city, that it worships God or gods who may aid it in reigning victoriously and peacefully on earth not through love of doing good, but through lust of rule. The good use the world that they may enjoy God: the wicked, on the contrary, that they may enjoy the world would fain use God,-those of them, at least, who have attained to the belief that He is and takes an interest in human affairs. For they who have not yet attained even to this belief are still at a much lower level. Cain, then, when he saw that God had respect to his brother's sacrifice, but not to his own, should have humbly chosen his good brother as his example, and not proudly counted him his rival. But he was wroth, and his countenance fell. This angry regret for another person's goodness, even his brother's, was charged upon him by God as a great sin. And He accused him of it in the interrogation, \"Why are thou wroth, and why is thy countenance fallen?\" For God saw that he envied his brother, and of this He accused him. For to men, from whom the heart of their fellow is hid, it might be doubtful and quite uncertain whether that sadness bewailed his own wickedness by which, as he had learned, he had displeased God, or his brother's goodness, which had pleased God, and won His favorable regard to his sacrifice. But God, in giving the reason why He refused to accept Cain's offering and why Cain should rather have been displeased at himself than at his brother, shows him that though he was unjust in \"not rightly distinguishing,\" that is, not rightly living and being unworthy to have his offering received, he was more unjust by far in hating his just brother without a cause.","title":"Book XV","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_21_book_xv_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"52","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"14.

We have endeavored, then, so to do; in order that we might see in some ;way or other by this image which we are, Him by whom we are made, as by a glass. And this is intimated also in the words of the same apostle: \"But we with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.\"[fn-19-P1955_984406:27-nf] \"Beholding as in a glass,\"[fn-19-P1956_984454:28-nf] he has said, i.e. seeing by means of a glass, not looking from a watch-tower: an ambiguity that does not exist in the Greek language, whence the apostolic epistles have been rendered into Latin. For in Greek, a glass,[fn-19-P1957_984690:29-nf] in which the images of things are visible, is wholly distinct in the sound of the word also from a watch-tower,[fn-19-P1958_984817:30-nf] from the height of which we command a more distant view. And it is quite plain that the apostle, in using the word \"speculantes\" in respect to the glory of the Lord, meant it to come from \"speculum,\" not from \"specula.\" But where he says, \"We are transformed into the same image,\" he assuredly means to speak of the image of God; and by calling it \"the same,\" he means that very image which we see in the glass, because that same image is also the glory of the Lord; as he says elsewhere, \"For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God,\"[fn-19-P1959_985415:31-nf] -a text already discussed in the twelfth book. He means, then, by \"We are transformed,\" that we are changed from one form to another, and that we pass from a form that is obscure to a form that is bright: since the obscure form, too, is the image of God; and if an image, then assuredly also \"glory,\" in which we are created as men, being better than the other animals. For it is said of human nature in itself, \"The man ought not to cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God.\" And this nature, being the most excellent among things created, is transformed from a form that is defaced into a form that is beautiful, when it is justified by its own Creator from ungodliness. Since even in ungodliness itself, the more the faultiness is to be condemned, the more certainly is the nature to be praised. And therefore he has added, \"from glory to glory:\" from the glory of creation to the glory of justification. Although these words, \"from glory to glory,\" may be understood also in other ways;-from the glory of faith to the glory of sight, from the glory whereby we are sons of God to the glory whereby we shall be like Him, because \"we shall see Him as He is.\"[fn-19-P1960_986611:32-nf] But in that he has added \"as from the Spirit of the Lord,\" he declares that the blessing of so desirable a transformation is conferred upon us by the grace of God.","title":"Book XV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_21_book_xv_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"62","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"21.

Now if, under the law, no one is justified, how is he perfectly undefiled in the way who is still walking and hastening to reach the goal?

For she is holy, alike in body and in spirit, who sins neither in mind nor heart, knowing that God is one who examines also the heart; and, therefore, she takes every pains to possess a mind as well as a body free from sin. Such a person is aware that it is written, \"Keep thy[fn-8-P802_322021:38-nf] heart with all diligence\"; and again, \"God loveth[fn-8-P803_322099:39-nf] holy hearts, and all the undefiled are acceptable to him\"; and elsewhere, \"Blessed[fn-8-P804_322199:40-nf] are those of a pure heart; for they shall see God.\" I think that this last statement is made regarding those whom conscience accuses of the guilt of no sin; concerning whom I think that John also spoke in his Epistle when he said, \"If our heart[fn-8-P805_322465:41-nf] condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God, and whatsoever we ask we shall receive from him.\" I do not wish you to think that you have escaped the accusation of sin, although act does not follow desire, since it is written, \"Whosoever[fn-8-P806_322727:42-nf] looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart.\" And do not say, \"I had the thought, indeed, but I did not carry it out in act\"; for it is unlawful even to desire that which it is unlawful to do. Wherefore also blessed Peter issues a precept to this effect: \"purify your[fn-8-P807_323062:43-nf] souls\"; and if he had not been aware of such a thing as defilement of the soul, he would not have expressed a desire that it should be purified. But we should also very carefully consider that passage which says, \"These[fn-8-P808_323301:44-nf] are they who did not defile themselves with women, for they remained virgins, and they follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth\"; and should reflect whether, if these are joined to the Divine retinue, and traverse all the regions of the heavens, through the merit of chastity and purity alone, there may be also other means by which virginity being assisted may attain to the glory of so great blessedness. But whence shall we be able to know this?From the following passages (if I mistake not) in which it is written, \"These were[fn-8-P809_323851:45-nf] purchased from among men as the first fruits to God and the Lamb, and in their mouth there was found no falsehood, for they are without spot before the throne of God.\" You see, then, that they are spoken of as closely following in the footsteps of the Lord, not in virtue of one member only, but those are said to do so, who, besides virginity, had passed a life freed from all the pollution of sin. Wherefore, let the virgin especially despise marriage on this account, that, while she is safer than others, she may the more easily accomplish what is also required from those who are married; viz. keep herself from all sin, and obey all the commandments of the law. For if she does not marry, and nevertheless indulges in those things from which even married women are enjoined to keep themselves free, what will it profit her not to have married?For although it is not allowed to any Christian to commit sin, and it befits all without exception who are purified through the sanctification of the spiritual bath, to lead an unstained life, that they may be thoroughly identified[fn-8-P810_324960:46-nf] with the Church, which is described as being \"without[fn-8-P811_325031:47-nf] spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing,\" much more is it requisite that a virgin should reach this standard, whom neither the existence of a husband, nor of sons, nor of any other necessity, prevents from fully carrying out the demands of holy Scripture; nor shall she be able, if she fail, to defend herself by any sort of excuse.","title":"Letter II.

The heretics themselves also, since they are thought to have the Christian name and sacraments, Scriptures, and profession, cause great grief in the hearts of the pious, both because many who wish to be Christians are compelled by their dissensions to hesitate, and many evil-speakers also find in them matter for blaspheming the Christian name, because they too are at any rate called Christians. By these and similar depraved manners and errors of men, those who will live piously in Christ suffer persecution, even when no one molests or vexes their body; for they suffer this persecution, not in their bodies, but in their hearts. Whence is that word, \"According to the multitude of my griefs in my heart;\" for he does not say, in my body. Yet, on the other hand, none of them can perish, because the immutable divine promises are thought of. And because the apostle says, \"The Lord knoweth them that are His;[fn-35-P3585_1941977:116-nf] for whom He did foreknow, He also predestinated [to be] conformed to the image of His Son,\"[fn-35-P3586_1942092:117-nf] none of them can perish; therefore it follows in that psalm, \"Thy consolations have delighted my soul.\"[fn-35-P3587_1942218:118-nf] But that grief which arises in the hearts of the pious, who are persecuted by the manners of bad or false Christians, is profitable to the sufferers, because it proceeds from the charity in which they do not wish them either to perish or to hinder the salvation of others. Finally, great consolations grow out of their chastisement, which imbue the souls of the pious with a fecundity as great as the pains with which they were troubled concerning their own perdition. Thus in this world, in these evil days, not only from the time of the bodily presence of Christ and His apostles, but even from that of Abel, whom first his wicked brother slew because he was righteous,[fn-35-P3588_1942911:119-nf] and thenceforth even to the end of this world, the Church has gone forward on pilgrimage amid the persecutions of the world and the consolations of God.

Moreover, what greater reason is apparent for the advent of the Lord than that God might show His love in us, commending it powerfully, inasmuch as \"while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us\"?[fn-28-P2855_1310261:27-nf] And furthermore, this is with the intent that, inasmuch as charity is \"the end of the commandment,\"[fn-28-P2856_1310382:28-nf] and \"the fulfilling of the law,\"[fn-28-P2857_1310433:29-nf] we also may love one another and lay down our life for the brethren, even as He laid down His life for us.[fn-28-P2858_1310560:30-nf] And with regard to God Himself, its object is that, even if it were an irksome task to love Him, it may now at least cease to be irksome for us to return His love, seeing that\" He first loved us,\"[fn-28-P2859_1310778:31-nf] and \"spared not His own only Son, but delivered Him up for us all.\"[fn-28-P2860_1310870:32-nf] For their is no mightier invitation to love than to anticipate in loving; and that soul is over hard which, supposing it unwilling indeed to give love, is unwilling also to give the return of love. But if, even in the case of criminal and sordid loves, we see how those who desire to be loved in return make it their special and absorbing business, by such proofs as are within their power, to render the strength of the love which they themselves bear plain and patent; if we also perceive how they affect to put forward an appearance of justice in what they thus offer, such as may qualify them in some sort to demand that a response be made in all fairness to them on the part of those souls which they are laboring to beguile; if, further, their own passion burns more vehemently when they observe that the minds which they are eager to possess are also moved now by the same fire: if thus, I say, it happens at once that the soul which before was torpid is excited so soon as it feels itself to be loved, and that the soul which was enkindled already becomes the more inflamed so soon as it is made cognizant of the return of its own love, it is evident that no greater reason is to be found why love should be either originated or enlarged, than what appears in the occasion when one who as yet loves not at all comes to know himself to be the object of love, or when one who is already a lover either hopes that he may yet be loved in turn, or has by this time the evidence of a response to his affection. And if this holds good even in the case of base loves, how much more[fn-28-P2861_1312473:33-nf] in (true) friendship? For what else have we carefully to attend to in this question touching the injuring of friendship than to this, namely, not to give our friend cause to suppose either that we do not love him at all, or that we love him less than he loves us? If, indeed, he is led to entertain this belief, he will be cooler in that love in which men enjoy the interchange of intimacies one with another; and if he is not of that weak type of character to which such an offense to affection will serve as a cause of freezing off from love altogether, he yet confines himself to that kind of affection in which he loves, not with the view of enjoyment to himself, but with the idea of studying the good of others. But again it is worth our while to notice how,-although superiors also have the wish to be loved by their inferiors, and are gratified with the zealous attention[fn-28-P2862_1313510:34-nf] paid to them by such, and themselves cherish greater affection towards these inferiors the more they become cognizant of that,-with what might of love, nevertheless, the inferior kindles so soon as he learns that he is beloved by his superior. For there have we love in its more grateful aspect, where it does not consume itself[fn-28-P2863_1313976:35-nf] in the drought of want, but flows forth in the plenteousness of beneficence. For the former type of love is of misery, the latter of mercy.[fn-28-P2864_1314144:36-nf] And furthermore, if the inferior was despairing even of the possibility of his being loved by his superior, he will now be inexpressibly moved to love if the superior has of his own will condescended to show how much he loves this person who could by no means be bold enough to promise himself so great a good. But what is there superior to God in the character of Judge? and what more desperate than man in the character of sinner?-than man, I ask, who had given himself all the more unreservedly up to the wardship and domination of proudpowers which are unable to make him blessed, as he had come more absolutely to despair of the possibility of his being an object of interest to that power which wills not to be exalted in wickedness, but is exalted in goodness.","title":"Introductory Notice.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_26_book_xx","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"99","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"But in what way shall the good go out to see the punishment of the wicked?

Therefore it is said, \"They shall go out,\" because they shall know what is done by those who are without.

At the same time they hold by this position, namely, to predicate the Holy Spirit neither as begotten, like the Son, of the Father; for Christ is the only one [so begotten]: nor as [begotten] of the Son, like a Grandson of the Supreme Father: while they do not affirm Him to owe that which He is to no one, but [admit Him to owe it] to the Father, of whom are all things; lest we should establish two Beginnings without beginning (ne duo constituamus principia isne principio), which would be an assertion at once most false and most absurd, and one proper not to the catholic faith, but to the error of certain heretics.[fn-32-P3275_1506357:92-nf] Some, however, have gone so far as to believe that the communion of the Father and the Son, and (so to speak) their Godhead (deitatem), which the Greeks designate qeotha, is the Holy Spirit; so that, inasmuch as the Father is God and the Son God, the Godhead itself, in which they are united with each other,-to wit, the former by begetting the Son, and the latter by cleaving to the Father,[fn-32-P3276_1506799:93-nf] -should [thereby] be constituted equal with Him by whom He is begotten. This Godhead, then, which they wish to be understood likewise as the love and charity subsisting between these two [Persons], the one toward the other, they affirm to have received the name of the Holy Spirit. And this opinion of theirs they support by many proofs drawn from the Scriptures; among which we might instance either the passage which says, \"For the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, who has been given unto us,\"[fn-32-P3277_1507383:94-nf] or many other proofs texts of a similar tenor: while they ground their position also upon the express fact that it is through the Holy Spirit that we are reconciled unto God; whence also, when He is called the Gift of God, they will have it that sufficient indication is offered of the love of God and the Holy Spirit being identical. For we are not reconciled unto Him except through that love in virtue of which we are also called sons:[fn-32-P3278_1507839:95-nf] as we are no more \"under fear, like servants,\"[fn-32-P3279_1507954:96-nf] because \"love, when it is made perfect, casteth out fear;\"[fn-32-P3280_1508033:97-nf] and [as] \"we have received the spirit of liberty, wherein we cry, Abba, Father.\"[fn-32-P3281_1508134:98-nf] And inasmuch as, being reconciled and called back into friendship through love, we shall be able to become acquainted with all the secret things of God, for this reason it is said of the Holy Spirit that \"He shall lead you into all truth.\"[fn-32-P3282_1508394:99-nf] For the same reason also, that confidence in preaching the truth, with which the apostles were filled at His advent,[fn-32-P3283_1508531:100-nf] is rightly ascribed to love; because diffidence also is assigned to fear, which the perfecting of love excludes. Thus, likewise, the same is called the Gift of God,[fn-32-P3284_1508715:101-nf] because no one enjoys that which he knows, unless he also love it. To enjoy the Wisdom of God, however, implies nothing else than to cleave to the same in love (ei dilectione cohaerere). Neither does any one abide in that which he apprehends, but by love; and accordingly the Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of sanctity (Spiritus Sanctus), inasmuch as all things that are sanctioned (sanciuntur)[fn-32-P3285_1509135:102-nf] are sanctioned with a view to their permanence, and there is no doubt that the term sanctity (sanctitatem) is derived from sanction (a sanciendo). Above all, however, that testimony is employed by the upholders of this opinion, where it is thus written, \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit;\"[fn-32-P3286_1509634:103-nf] \"for God is a Spirit.\"[fn-32-P3287_1509677:104-nf] For here He speaks of our regeneration,[fn-32-P3288_1509737:105-nf] which is not, according to Adam, of the flesh, but, according to Christ, of the Holy Spirit. Wherefore, if in this passage mention is made of the Holy Spirit, when it is said, \"For God is a Spirit,\" they maintain that we must take note that it is not said, \"for the Spirit is God,\"[fn-32-P3289_1510223:106-nf] but, \"for God is a Spirit;\" so that the very Godhead of the Father and the Son is in this passage called God, and that is the Holy Spirit. To this is added another testimony which the Apostle John offers, when he says, \"For God is love.\"[fn-32-P3290_1510571:107-nf] For here, in like manner, what he says is not, \"Love is God,\"[fn-32-P3291_1510655:108-nf] but, \"God is love;\" so that the very Godhead is taken to be love. And with respect to the circumstance that, in that enumeration of mutually connected objects which is given when it is said, \"All things are yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's,\"[fn-32-P3292_1511009:109-nf] as also, \"The head of the woman is the man, the Head of the man is Christ, and the Head of Christ is God,\"[fn-32-P3293_1511143:110-nf] there is no mention of the Holy Spirit; this they affirm to be but an application of the principle that, in general, the connection itself is not wont to be enumerated among the things which are connected with each other. Whence, also, those who read with closer attention appear to recognize the express Trinity likewise in that passage in which it is said, \"For of Him, and through Him, and in Him, are all things.\"[fn-32-P3294_1511582:111-nf] \"Of Him,\" as if it meant, of that One who owes it to no one that He is: \"through Him,\" as if the idea were, through a Mediator; \"in Him,\" as if it were, in that One who holds together, that is, unites by connecting.","title":"Introductory Notice.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_28_book_xxii","source_chapter":31,"source_paragraph":"133","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"And now let us consider, with such ability as God may vouchsafe, how the saints shall be employed when they are clothed in immortal and spiritual bodies, and when the flesh shall live no longer in a fleshly but a spiritual fashion. And indeed, to tell the truth, I am at a loss to understand the nature of that employment, or, shall I rather say, repose and ease, for it has never come within the range of my bodily senses. And if I should speak of my mind or understanding, what is our understanding in comparison of its excellence? For then shall be that \"peace of God which,\" as the apostle says, \"passeth all understanding,\"[fn-45-P4527_2507528:67-nf] -that is to say, all human, and perhaps all angelic understanding, but certainly not the divine. That it passeth ours there is no doubt; but if it passeth that of the angels,-and he who says \"\"all understanding\" seems to make no exception in their favor, then we must understand him to mean thai neither we nor the angels can understand, as God understands, the peace which God Himself enjoys. Doubtless this passeth all understanding but His own. But as we shall one day be made to participate, according to our slender capacity, in His peace, both in ourselves, and with our neighbor, and with God our chief good, in this respect the angels understand the peace of God in their own measure, and men too, though now far behind them, whatever spiritual advance they have made.

Thus, then, the angels of God are our angels, as Christ is God's and also ours. They are God's, because they have not abandoned Him; they are ours, because we are their fellow-citizens. The Lord Jesus also said, \"See that ye despise not one of these little ones: for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always see the face of my Father which is in heaven.\"[fn-45-P4530_2509307:70-nf] As, then, they see, so shall we also see; but not yet do we thus see. Wherefore the apostle uses the words cited a little ago, \"Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face.\" This vision is reserved as the reward of our faith; and of it the Apostle John also says, \"When He shall appear, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.\"[fn-45-P4531_2509684:71-nf] \"By \"the face\" of God we are to understand His manifestation, and not a part of the body similar to that which in our bodies we call by that name.","title":"Book XXII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_118_treatise_viii_on_works_and_alms_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"19","folder":"ANF-05","text":"16.

I repeat his words once more: \"You assert,\" says he to me, \"that they, indeed, who have not been ever born might possibly have been good; those, however, who have peopled the world, and for whom Christ died, you decide to be the work of the devil, born in a disordered state, and guilty from the very beginning.\" Would that he only solved the entire controversy as he unties the knot of this question! For will he pretend to say that he merely spoke of adults in this passage? Why, the subject in hand is about infants, about human beings at their birth; and it is about these that he raises odium against us, because they are defined by us as guilty from the very first, because we declare them to be guilty, since Christ died for them. And why did Christ die for them if they are not guilty? It is entirely from them, yes, from them, we shall find the reason, wherefore he thought odium should be raised against me. He asks: \"How are infants guilty, for whom Christ died?\" We answer: Nay, how are infants not guilty, since Christ died for them? This dispute wants a judge to determine it. Let Christ be the Judge, and let Him tell us what is the object which has profited by His death? \"This is my blood,\" He says, \"which shall be shed[fn-43-P4390_1668446:133-nf] for many for the remission of sins.\"[fn-43-P4391_1668502:134-nf] Let the apostle, too, be His assessor in the judgment; since even in the apostle it is Christ Himself that speaks. Speaking of God the Father, he exclaims: \"He who spared. not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all!\"[fn-43-P4392_1668748:135-nf] I suppose that he describes Christ as so delivered up for us all, that infants in this matter are not separated from ourselves. But what need is there to dwell on this point, out of which even he no longer raises a contest? For the truth is, he not only confesses that Christ died even for infants, but he also reproves us out of this admission, because we say that these same infants are guilty for whom Christ died. Now, then, let the apostle, who says that Christ was delivered up for us all, also tell us why Christ was delivered up for us. \"He was delivered,\" says he, \"for our offences, and rose again for our justification.\"[fn-43-P4393_1669402:136-nf] If, therefore, as even this man both confesses and professes, both admits and objects, infants, too, are included amongst those for whom Christ was delivered up; and if it was for our sins that Christ was delivered up, even infants, of course, must have original sins, for whom Christ was delivered up; He must have something in them to heal, who (as Himself affirms) is not needed as a Physician by the whole, but by the sick;[fn-43-P4394_1669850:137-nf] He must have a reason for saving them, seeing that He came into the world, as the Apostle Paul says, \"to save sinners;\"[fn-43-P4395_1669992:138-nf] He must have something in them to remit, who testifies that He shed His blood \"for the remission of sins;\"[fn-43-P4396_1670120:139-nf] He must have good reason for seeking them out, who \"came,\" as He says, \"to seek and to save that which was lost;\"[fn-43-P4397_1670257:140-nf] the Son of man must find in them something to destroy, who came for the express purpose, as the Apostle John says, \"that He might destroy the works of the devil.\"[fn-43-P4398_1670441:141-nf] Now to this salvation of infants He must be an enemy, who asserts their innocence, in such a way as to deny them the medicine which is required by the hurt and wounded.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_116_tractate_cxi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"2. But as we have already, in a way proportionate to the brevity of our discourse, spoken of the objects of the promise, and of its own stability; let us now look at this one point, as far as we are able, what it is that He was pleased to promise when He said, \"I will that they also whom Thou hast given me be with me where I am.\" As far as pertains to the creaturehood wherein He was made of the seed of David according to the flesh,[fn-35-P3572_1982634:6-nf] not even He Himself was yet where He would afterwards be: but He could say in this way, \"where I am,\" to let us understand that He was soon to ascend into heaven, so that He spake of Himself as being already there, where He was presently to be. He could do so also in the same way as He had said on a former occasion, when speaking to Nicodemus, \"No man ascendeth into heaven, save He that came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven.\"[fn-35-P3573_1983100:7-nf] For there also He did not say, Will be, but \"is,\" because of the oneness of person, wherein God is at once man, and man God. He promised, therefore, that we should be in heaven; for thither the servant-form, which He received of the Virgin, has been elevated, and set at the right hand of the Father. Because of the same blessed hope the apostle also says: \"But God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ; by whose grace we are saved; and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.\"[fn-35-P3574_1983744:8-nf] And so accordingly we may understand the Lord to have said, \"That where I am, there they may be also.\" He, indeed, said of Himself that He was there already; but of us He merely declared that He wished us to be there with Him, without any indication that we were there already But what the Lord said that He wished to be done, the apostle spake of as already accomplished. For he said not, He will yet raise us up, and make us sit in heavenly places; but, \"hath raised us up, and made us sit in heavenly places:\" for it is not without good grounds, but in believing assurance, that he reckons as already done what he is certain will yet be done. But if it is in respect of the form of God, wherein He is equal to the Father, that we would be inclined to understand His words, \"I will that they also be with me, where I am,\" let our mind get quit of every thought of material images: whateverthe soul has had presented to it, that is endowed with length, or breadth, or thickness, tinted by the light with any sort of bodily hue, or diffused through local space of any kind, whether finite or infinite, let it, as far as possible, turn away from all such notions the glance of its contemplation on the inward bent of its thoughts. And let us not be making inquiries as to where the Son, the Father's co-equal, is, since no one has yet found out where He is not. But if any one would inquire, let him inquire rather how he may be with Him; not everywhere as He is, but wherever He may be. For when He said to the man that was expiating his crimes on the tree, and making confession unto salvation, \"Today shall thou be with me in paradise,\"[fn-35-P3575_1985400:9-nf] in respect to His human nature His own soul was on that very day to be in hell,[fn-35-P3576_1985500:10-nf] His flesh in the sepulchre; but as respected His Godhead He was certainly also in paradise. And therefore the soul of the thief, absolved from his by-gone crimes, and already in the blessed enjoyment of His grace, although it could not be everywhere as He was, yet could on that very day be also with Him in paradise, from which He, who is always everywhere, had not withdrawn. On this account, doubtless, it was not enough for Him to say, \"I will that they also be where I am;\" but He added, \"with me.\" For to be with Him is the chief good. For even the miserable can be where He is, since wheresoever any are, there is He also; but the blessed only are with Him, because it is only of Him that they can be blessed. Was it not truly said to God, \"If I ascend into heaven, Thou art there; and if I go down into hell, Thou art present?\"[fn-35-P3577_1986354:11-nf] or is not Christ after all that Wisdom of God which \"penetrateth everywhere because of its purity\"?[fn-35-P3578_1986474:12-nf] But the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not.[fn-35-P3579_1986567:13-nf] And similarly, to take a kind of illustration from what is visible, although greatly unlike, as the blind man, even though he be where the light is, is yet not himself with the light, but is really absent from that which is present; so the unbeliever and profane, or even the believer and pious, because not yet competent to gaze on the light of wisdom, although he cannot be anywhere that Christ is not there likewise, yet is not himself with Christ, I mean in actual sight. For we cannot doubt that the true believer is with Christ by faith; because in reference to this He saith, \"He that is not with me is against me.\"[fn-35-P3580_1987207:14-nf] But when He said to God the Father, \"I will that they also whom Thou hast given me be with me where I am,\" He spake exclusively of that sight wherein we shall see Him as He is.[fn-35-P3581_1987404:15-nf] ","title":"Tractate CXI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"140","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"86. Consequently, let us now take up the subject which we had postponed, and inquire what mystical meaning may underlie the report given by Matthew and Mark, namely, that on rising He made this statement, \"I will go before you into Galilee: there shall ye see me.\" For this announcement, if it was fulfilled at all, was certainly not fulfilled till a considerable interval had elapsed; whereas it is couched in terms which seem to lead us (although such a conclusion is not an absolute necessity) most naturally to expect that the appearance referred to would be either the only one or the first that would ensue. We observe, however, that the words in question are not given as the words of the evangelist himself, in the form of a narrative of a past occurrence, but as the words of the angel, who spoke according to the Lord's commission, and subsequently also as the words of the Lord Himself; that is to say, the words are used by the evangelist in his narrative, but they are presented by him as a direct statement of what was spoken by the angel and by the Lord. This, therefore, unquestionably compels us to accept them as uttered prophetically.[fn-27-P2724_1210862:350-nf] Now Galilee may be interpreted to mean either \"Transmigration\" or \"Revelation.\" Consequently, if we adopt the idea of \"Transmigration,\" what other sense occurs to us to put upon the sentence,\" He goeth before you into Galilee, there shall you see Him,\" but just this, that the grace of Christ was to be transferred from the people of Israel to the Gentiles? That in preaching the gospel to these Gentiles, the apostles would meet with no acceptance unless the Lord prepared a way for them in the hearts of men,-this may be what is to be understood by the sentence, \"He goeth before you into Galilee.\" And, again, that they would look with joy and wonder at the breaking down and removing of difficulties, and at the opening of a door for them in the Lord through the enlightenment of the believing,-this is what is to be understood by the words, \"there shall ye see Him;\" that is to say, there shall ye find His members, there shall ye recognise His living body in the person of those who shall receive you. Or, if we follow the second view which takes Galilee to signify \"Revelation,\" the idea may be, that He was now no more to be in the form of a servant, but in that form in which He is equal with the Father;[fn-27-P2725_1212260:351-nf] as He promised to those who loved Him when He said, according to the testimony of John, \"And I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.\"[fn-27-P2726_1212427:352-nf] That is to say, He was afterwards to manifest Himself, not merely as they saw Him before, nor merely in the way in which, rising as He did with His wounds upon Him, He was to give Himself to be touched as well as seen by them, but in the character of that ineffable light, wherewith He enlightens every man that cometh into this world, and in virtue of which He shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehends Him not.[fn-27-P2727_1212869:353-nf] Thus has He gone before us to something from which He withdraws not, although He comes to us, and which does not involve His leaving us, although He has preceded us thither. That will be a revelation which may be spoken of as a true Galilee, when we shall be like Him; there shall we see Him as He is.[fn-27-P2728_1213191:354-nf] Then, also, will there be for us the more blessed transmigration, from this world into that eternity, if we embrace His precepts so as to be counted worthy of being set apart on His right hand. For there, those on the left hand shall go away into eternal burning, but the righteous into life eternal.[fn-27-P2729_1213514:355-nf] Hence they shall pass thither, and there, shall they see Him, as the wicked do not see Him. For the wicked shall be taken away, so that he shall not see the brightness of the Lord;[fn-27-P2730_1213720:356-nf] and the unrighteousness shall not see the light. For He says, \"And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent;\"[fn-27-P2731_1213917:357-nf] even as He shall be known in that eternity to which He will bring His servants by the form of a servant, in order that in liberty they may contemplate the form of the Lord.

So John also says, \"He that hateth his brother is a murderer.\"[fn-18-P1874_1061185:42-nf] And as it was thought that adultery meant only the act of unlawful intercourse with a woman, the Master showed that the lust He describes is also adultery. Again, because perjury is a heinous sin, while there is no sin either in not swearing at all or in swearing truly, the Lord wished to secure us from departing from the truth by not swearing at all, rather than that we should be in danger of perjury by being in the habit of swearing truly. For one who never swears is less in danger of swearing falsely than one who is in the habit of swearing truly. So, in the discourses of the apostle which are recorded, he never used an oath, lest he should ever fall unawares into perjury from being in the habit of swearing. In his writings, on the other hand, where he had more leisure and opportunity for caution, we find him using oaths in several places,[fn-18-P1875_1062062:43-nf] to teach us that there is no sin in swearing truly, but that, on account of the infirmity of human nature, we are best preserved from perjury by not swearing at all.

Sin, then, is any transgression in deed, or word, or desire, of the eternal law.

Man, we know, consists of soul and body; but so does a beast. Again, it is plain that in the order of nature the soul is superior to the body. Moreover, in the soul of man there is reason, which is not in a beast.

But sometimes a peril to eternal salvation itself is put forth against us;[fn-45-P4507_2211241:84-nf] which peril, they cry out, we by telling a lie, if otherwise if cannot be, must ward off. As, for instance, if a person who is to be baptized be in the power of impious and infidel men, and cannot be got at that he may be washed with the layer of regeneration, but by deceiving his keepers with a lie. From this most invidious cry, by which we are compelled, not for a man's wealth or honors in this world which are fleeting by, not for the life itself of this present time, but for the eternal salvation of a human being, to tell a lie, whither shall I betake me for refuge but unto thee, O truth? And by thee is put forth before me,[fn-45-P4508_2211893:85-nf] Chastity. For why, if those keepers may be enticed to admit us to baptize the man, by our committing lewdness, do we refuse to do things contrary to chastity, and yet, if by a lie they may be deceived, consent to do things contrary to truth? when without doubt no man would faithfully think chastity amiable, but because it is enjoined of truth? So then, to get at a man to baptize him, let the keepers be deceived by lying, if truth bid it. But how can truth bid in order that a man may be baptized, that we should tell a lie, if chastity biddeth not, in order that a man be baptized, that we should commit whoredom? Now why doth chastity not bid this, but because this truth teacheth not? If then, save what truth teacheth, we ought not to do, when truth teacheth not even for the sake of baptizing a man to do what is contrary to chastity, how shall she teach us to do for the sake of baptizing a man what is contrary to herself, the truth? But like as eyes not strong enough to look upon the sun yet do gladly look upon the objects which are by the sun enlightened, so, souls which have already strength to delight in the beauty of chastity are yet not straightway able to consider in her very self that truth whence charity hath her light, insomuch that when it cometh to the doing of somewhat that is adverse to truth, they should so start back in horror as they do start back in horror if aught be proposed to be done that is adverse to chastity.

Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.\"[fn-99-P9900_2735119:152-nf] Accordingly, it is in our mind that he shows that we rise (with Christ), since it is by this alone that we are as yet able to reach to heavenly objects. These we should not \"seek,\" nor \"set our affection on,\" if we had them already in our possession. He also adds: \"For ye are dead\"-to your sins, he means, not to yourselves-\"and your life is hid with Christ in God.\"[fn-99-P9901_2735510:153-nf] Now that life is not yet apprehended which is hidden. In like manner John says: \"And it doth not yet appear what we shall be: we know, however, that when He shall be manifest, we shall be like Him.\"[fn-99-P9902_2735725:154-nf] We are far indeed from being already what we know not of; we should, of course, be sure to know it if we were already (like Him). It is therefore the contemplation of our blessed hope even in this life by faith (that he speaks of)-not its presence nor its possession, but only its expectation. Concerning this expectation and hope Paul writes to the Galatians: \"For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.\"[fn-99-P9903_2736181:155-nf] He says \"we wait for it,\" not we are in possession of it. By the righteousness of God, he means that judgment which we shall have to undergo as the recompense of our deeds. It is in expectation of this for himself that the apostle writes to the Philippians: \"If by any means,\" says he, \"I might attain to the resurrection of the dead. Not as though I had already attained, or were already perfect.\"[fn-99-P9904_2736598:156-nf] And yet he had believed, and had known all mysteries, as an elect vessel and the great teacher of the Gentiles; but for all that he goes on to say: \"I, however, follow on, if so be I may apprehend that for which I also am apprehended of Christ.\"[fn-99-P9905_2736870:157-nf] Nay, more: \"Brethren,\" (he adds), \"I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing (I do), forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of blamelessness,[fn-99-P9906_2737141:158-nf] whereby I may attain it; \"meaning the resurrection from the dead in its proper time. Even as he says to the Galatians: \"Let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due season we shall reap.\"[fn-99-P9907_2737486:159-nf] Similarly, concerning Onesiphorus, does he also write to Timothy: \"The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy in that day; \"[fn-99-P9908_2737634:160-nf] unto which day and time he charges Timothy himself \"to keep what had been committed to his care, without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ: which in His times He shall show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords,\"[fn-99-P9909_2737936:161-nf] speaking of (Him as) God It is to these same times that Peter in the Acts refers, when he says: \"Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; and He shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of His holy prophets.\"[fn-99-P9910_2738409:162-nf] ","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":3,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_38_book_iii_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"36","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"\"They assert,\" say they, \"that baptism, moreover, does not make men new-that is, does not give complete remission of sins; but they contend that they are partly made children of God and partly remain children of the world, that is, of the devil.\" They deceive; they lay traps; they shuffle; we do not say this. For we say that all men who are children of the devil are also children of the world; but not that all children of the world are also children of the devil. Far be it from us to say that the holy fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and others of this kind, were children of the devil when they were begetting in marriage, and those believers who until now and still hereafter continue to beget. And yet we cannot contradict the Lord when He says, \"The children of this world marry and give in marriage.\"[fn-54-P5404_2118890:13-nf] Some, therefore, are children of this world, and yet are not children of the devil. For although the devil is the author and source of all sins, yet it is not every sin that makes children of the devil; for the children of God also sin, since if they say they have no sins they deceive themselves, and the truth is not in them.[fn-54-P5405_2119236:14-nf] But they sin in virtue of that condition by which they are still children of this world; but by that grace wherewith they are the children of God they certainly sin not, because every one that is born of God sinneth not.[fn-54-P5406_2119475:15-nf] But unbelief makes children of the devil; and unbelief is specially called sin, as if it were the only one, if it is not expressed what is the nature of the sin. As when the \"apostle\" is spoken of, if it be not expressed what apostle, none is understood but Paul; because he is better known by his many epistles, and he laboured more than they all. For which reason, in what the Lord said of the Holy Spirit,\" He shall convict the world of sin,\"[fn-54-P5407_2119941:16-nf] He meant unbelief to be understood; for He said this when He was explaining, \"Of sin because they believed not on me,\"[fn-54-P5408_2120078:17-nf] and when He says, \"If I had not come and spoken to them, they should not have sin.\"[fn-54-P5409_2120180:18-nf] For He meant not that before they had no sin, but He wished to indicate that very want of faith by which they did not believe Him even when He was present to them and speaking to them; since they belonged to him of whom the apostle says, \"According to the prince of the power of the air, who now worketh in the children of unbelief.\"[fn-54-P5410_2120532:19-nf] Therefore they in whom there is not faith are the children of the devil, because they have not in the inner man any reason why there should be forgiven them whatever is committed either by human infirmity, or by ignorance, or by any evil will whatever. But those are the children of God who certainly, if they should \"say that they have no sin, deceive themselves,and the truth is not in them, but immediately\" (as it continues) \"when they confess their sins\" (which the children of the devil do not do, or do not do according to the faith which is peculiar to the children of God), \"He is faithful and just to forgive them their sins, and to cleanse them from all unrighteousness.\"[fn-54-P5411_2121232:20-nf] And in order that what we say may be more fully understood, let Jesus Himself be heard, who certainly was speaking to the children of God when He said: \"And if ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him.\"[fn-54-P5412_2121563:21-nf] For if these were not the children of God, He would not say to them, \"Your Father which is in heaven.\" And yet He says that they are evil, and that they know how to give good gifts to their children. Are they, then, evil in that they are the children of God? Away with the thought!

For, in respect to this infirmity, that little righteousness of man's is perfect according to its measure, when it understands even what it lacks. And therefore the apostle calls himself both perfect and imperfect,[fn-55-P5510_2161892:74-nf] -imperfect, to wit, in the thought of how much is wanting to him for the righteousness for the fulness of which he is still hungering and thirsting; but perfect in that he does not blush to confess his own imperfection, and goes forward in good that he may attain. As we can say that the wayfarer is perfect whose approach is well forwarded, although his intention is not carried out unless his arrival be actually effected. Therefore, when he had said,\" According to the righteousness which is in the law, I am one who has been without blame,\" he immediately added, \"What things were gain to me, those I counted but loss for Christ's sake. Yea, doubtless, and I count all things to be loss for the sake of the eminent knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord: for whose sake I have believed all things not only to be losses, but I have thought them to be even as dung, that I might gain Christ and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is by the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God in faith.\"[fn-55-P5511_2162967:75-nf] See! the apostle does not, of course, say falsely, that \"according to the righteousness which is of the law he was without blame;\" and yet those things which were gain to him, he casts away for Christ's sake, and thinks them losses, injuries, dung. And not only these things, but all other things which he mentioned previously; not on account of any kind of knowledge, but, as he himself says, \"the eminent knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord,\" which, beyond a doubt, he had as yet in faith, but not yet in sight. For then the knowledge of Christ will be eminent, when He shall be so revealed that what is believed is seen.

For, expounding Isaiah the Prophet in reference to what is written, \"I have begotten and brought up children, and they have despised me,\"[fn-57-P5785_2272533:126-nf] he undertook to dispute concerning the generations which are of God, and in that argument he quoted the testimony of John when he says, \"He that is bornof God sinneth not.\"[fn-57-P5786_2272724:127-nf] And, treating the samevery difficult question, he says: \"Since in this world there is none who is free from sin; since John himself says, `If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar.'[fn-57-P5787_2272941:128-nf] But if `they that are born of God sin not,' and if these words refer to those of them who are in the world, it is necessary that we should regard them as those numberless people who have obtained God's grace by the regeneration of the laver. But yet, when the prophet says, `All things are waiting upon Thee, that Thou mayest give them meat in season. That Thou givest them they gather for themselves; when Thou openest Thine hand, all things shall be filled with goodness. But when Thou turnest away Thy face, they shall be troubled: Thou shall take away their breath, and they shall fail, and shall be turned into their dust. Thou shall send forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be created: and Thou shalt renew the face of the earth,'[fn-57-P5788_2273696:129-nf] such things as these cannot seem to have been said of any time whatever but of that future time, in which there shall be a new earth and a new heaven. Therefore they shall be disturbed that they may take their beginning. `And when Thou openest Thy hand all things shall be filled with goodness,' which is not easily characteristic of this age. For concerning this age what does Scripture say? `There is none that doeth good, no, not one.'[fn-57-P5789_2274160:130-nf] If, therefore, there are different generations,-and here the very entrance into this life is the receiver of sins to such an extent that even he who begot should be despised; while another generation does not receive sins;-let us consider whether by any means there may not be a regeneration for us after the course of this life,-of which regeneration it is said, `In the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of His glory.'[fn-57-P5790_2274623:131-nf] For as that is called the regeneration of washing whereby we are renewed from the filth of sins washed away, so that seems to be called a regeneration by which we are purified from every stain of bodily materiality, and are regenerated in the pure sense of the soul to life eternal; so that every quality of regeneration may be purer than ofthat washing, so that no suspicion of sins can fall either on a man's doings, or even on his very thoughts themselves.\" Moreover, in another place in the same work he says: \"We see it to be impossible that any person created in a body can be absolutely spotless, since even Paul says I that he is imperfect. For thus he has it: `Not that I have already received, or am already perfect;'[fn-57-P5791_2275373:132-nf] and yet after a little he says, 'As many of us, therefore, as are perfect.'[fn-57-P5792_2275471:133-nf] Unless, perchance, there is one perfection in this world, another after this is completed, of which he says to the Corinthians, `When that which is perfect is come;'[fn-57-P5793_2275659:134-nf] and elsewhere, `Till we all come into the unity of the faith, and the knowledge of the Son of God, into the perfect man to the measure of the age of the fulness of Christ.'[fn-57-P5794_2275857:135-nf] As, then, the apostle says that many are placed in this world who are perfect along with him, but who, if you have regard to true perfection, could not be perfect, since he says, `We see now through a mirror, enigmatically; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then I shall know even as also I am known:'[fn-57-P5795_2276192:136-nf] so also there both are those who are 'spotless' in this world, and will be those who are 'spotless' in the kingdom of God, although certainly, if you consider it accurately, no person can be spotless, because no person is without sin.\" Also in the same he says: \"We see that, while we live in this life, we ought to purify ourselves and to seek God; and to begin from the purification of our soul, and as it were to establish the foundations of virtue, so that we may deserve to attain the perfection of our purgation after this life.\" And again, in the same he says: \"But laden and groaning, who does not say, `O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?'[fn-57-P5796_2276905:137-nf] So with the same teacher we give all varieties of interpretation. For if he is unhappy who recognises himself as involved in the evils of the body, certainly everybody is unhappy; for I should not call that man happy who, being confused with any darkness of his mind, does not know his own condition. That, moreover, has not absurdly come to be understood; for if a man who knows himself is unhappy, assuredly all are wretched, because every one either recognises his weakness by wisdom, or by folly is ignorant of it.\" Moreover, in the treatise \"On the Benefit of Death,\" he says:[fn-57-P5797_2277508:138-nf] \"Let death work in us, in order that that may work life also, a good life after death,-that is, a good life after victory, a good life after the contest is finished; so that now no longer the law of the flesh may know how to resist the law of the mind, that no longer we may have any contention with the body of death.\" Again, in the same treatise he says: \"Therefore, because the righteous have this reward, that they see the face of God, and that light which lightens every man, let us henceforth put on the desire of this kind of reward, that our soul may draw near to God, our prayer may draw near to Him, our desire may cleave, to Him, that we be not separated from Him. And placed here as we are, let us by meditating, by reading, by seeking, be united with God. Let us know Him as we can. For we know Him in part here; because here all things are imperfect, there all are perfect; here we are infants, there we shall be strong men. `We see,' says he, `now through a mirror in an enigma, but then face to face.' Then, His face being revealed, we shall be allowed to look upon the glory of God, which now our souls, involved in the compacted dregs of this body, and shadowed by some stains and filth of this flesh, cannot clearly see. `For who,' He says, `shall see my face and live?' and rightly. For if our eyes cannot bear the rays of the sun,-and if any one should gaze too long on the region of the sun he is said to be blinded,-if a creature cannot look upon a creature without deceit and offence, how can he without his own peril look upon the glittering face of the eternal Creator, covered as he is with the clothing of this body? For who is justified in God's sight, when even the infant of one day cannot be pure from sin, and no one can boast of his integrity and pureness of heart?\"","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_40_a_treatise_on_grace_and_free_will_","source_chapter":37,"source_paragraph":"125","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"The Apostle Peter, likewise, says, \"And, above all things, have fervent love among yourselves: for love shall cover the multitude of sins.\"[fn-61-P6189_2390406:202-nf] The Apostle James also says, \"If ye fulfil the royal law, according to the Scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well.\"[fn-61-P6190_2390569:203-nf] So also the Apostle John says, \"He that loveth his brother abideth in the right;\"[fn-61-P6191_2390670:204-nf] again, in another passage, \"Whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother; for this is the message which we have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.\"[fn-61-P6192_2390907:205-nf] Then he says again, \"This is His commandment, that we should believe on the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another.\"[fn-61-P6193_2391063:206-nf] Once more: \"And this commandment have we from Him that he who loveth God love his brother also.\"[fn-61-P6194_2391183:207-nf] Then shortly afterwards he adds, \"By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep His commandments; for this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments: and His commandments are not grievous.\"[fn-61-P6195_2391434:208-nf] While, in his second Epistle, it is written, \"Not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.\"[fn-61-P6196_2391623:209-nf] ","title":"A Treatise on Grace and Free Will.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_40_a_treatise_on_grace_and_free_will_","source_chapter":37,"source_paragraph":"125","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"The Apostle Peter, likewise, says, \"And, above all things, have fervent love among yourselves: for love shall cover the multitude of sins.\"[fn-61-P6189_2390406:202-nf] The Apostle James also says, \"If ye fulfil the royal law, according to the Scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well.\"[fn-61-P6190_2390569:203-nf] So also the Apostle John says, \"He that loveth his brother abideth in the right;\"[fn-61-P6191_2390670:204-nf] again, in another passage, \"Whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother; for this is the message which we have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.\"[fn-61-P6192_2390907:205-nf] Then he says again, \"This is His commandment, that we should believe on the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another.\"[fn-61-P6193_2391063:206-nf] Once more: \"And this commandment have we from Him that he who loveth God love his brother also.\"[fn-61-P6194_2391183:207-nf] Then shortly afterwards he adds, \"By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep His commandments; for this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments: and His commandments are not grievous.\"[fn-61-P6195_2391434:208-nf] While, in his second Epistle, it is written, \"Not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.\"[fn-61-P6196_2391623:209-nf] ","title":"A Treatise on Grace and Free Will.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_40_a_treatise_on_grace_and_free_will_","source_chapter":42,"source_paragraph":"135","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"It is no wonder that light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not.[fn-62-P6232_2400037:230-nf] In John's Epistle the Light declares,\" Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.\"[fn-62-P6233_2400198:231-nf] And in the Pelagian writings the darkness says, \"Love comes to us of our own selves.\" Now, if they only possessed the true, that is, Christian love, they would also know whence they obtained possession of it; even as the apostle knew when he said, \"But we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.\"[fn-62-P6234_2400618:232-nf] John says, \"God is love.\"[fn-62-P6235_2400666:233-nf] And thus the Pelagians affirm that they actually have God Himself, not from God, but from their own selves! and although they allow that we have the knowledge of the law from God, they will yet have it that love is from our very selves.

Because thou didst suffer the sun to rise and go down so often upon thy wrath, and madest it inveterate, because thou contractedst evil suspicions, and wateredst the mote, and by watering hast nourished it, and by nourishing it, hast made it a beam. Tremble then at least when it is said, \"Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer.\"[fn-34-P3438_1503097:38-nf] Thou hast not drawn the sword, nor inflicted any bodily wound, nor by any blow killed another; the thought only of hatred is in thy heart, and hereby art thou held to be a murderer, guilty art thou before the eyes of God. The other man is alive, and yet thou hast killed him. As far as thou art concerned, thou hast killed the man whom thou hatest. Reform then, and amend thyself, If scorpions or adders were in your houses, how would ye toil to purify them, that ye might be able to dwell in safety? Yet are ye angry, yea inveterate anger is in your hearts, and there grow so many hatreds, so many beams, so many scorpions, so many vipers, and will ye not then purify the house of God, your heart? Do then what is said, \"As we also forgive our debtors;\" and so say securely,\" Forgive us our debts.\" For without debts in this earth ye cannot live; but those great crimes which it is your blessing to have been forgiven in Baptism, and from which we ought to be ever free, are of one sort, and of another are those daily sins, without which a man cannot live in this world, by reason of which this daily prayer with its covenant and agreement is necessary; that as we say with all cheerfulness, \"Forgive us our debts;\" so we may say with all truth, \"As we also forgive our debtors.\" So much then have we said as touching past sins; what now for the future?","title":"Sermon VIII.

To whom would He have rather made known the veiled import of His own language, than to him to whom He disclosed the likeness of His own glory-to Peter, John, and James, and afterwards to Paul, to whom He granted participation in (the joys of) paradise too, prior to his martyrdom? Or do they also write differently from what they think-teachers using deceit, not truth? Addressing the Christians of Pontus, Peter, at all events, says, \"How great indeed is the glory, if ye suffer patiently, without being punished as evildoers! For this is a lovely feature, and even hereunto were ye called, since Christ also suffered for us, leaving you Himself as an example, that ye should follow His own steps.\"[fn-110-P11074_3143848:79-nf] And again: \"Beloved, be not alarmed by the fiery trial which is taking place among you, as though some strange thing happened unto you. For, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings, do ye rejoice; that, when His glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. If ye are reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; because glory and the Spirit of God rest upon you: if only none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evil-doer, or as a busybody in other men's matters; yet (if any man suffer) as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God on this behalf.\"[fn-110-P11075_3144490:80-nf] John, in fact, exhorts us to lay down our lives even for our brethren,[fn-110-P11076_3144618:81-nf] affirming that there is no fear in love: \"For perfect love casteth out fear, since fear has punishment; and he who fears is not perfect in love.\"[fn-110-P11077_3144785:82-nf] What fear would it be better to understand (as here meant), than that which gives rise to denial? What love does he assert to be perfect, but that which puts fear to flight, and gives courage to confess? What penalty will he appoint as the punishment of fear, but that which he who denies is about to pay, who has to be slain, body and soul, in hell? And if he teaches that we must die for the brethren, how much more for the Lord,-he being sufficiently prepared, by his own Revelation too, forgiving such advice! For indeed the Spirit had sent the injunction to the angel of the church in Smyrna: \"Behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried ten days. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.\"[fn-110-P11078_3145557:83-nf] Also to the angel of the church in Pergamus (mention was made) of Antipas,[fn-110-P11079_3145650:84-nf] the very faithful martyr, who was slain where Satan dwelleth. Also to the angel of the church in Philadelphia[fn-110-P11080_3145778:85-nf] (it was signified) that he who had not denied the name of the Lord was delivered from the last trial. Then to every conqueror the Spirit promises now the tree of life, and exemption from the second death; now the hidden manna with the stone of glistening whiteness, and the name unknown ( to every man save him that receiveth it); now power to rule with a rod of iron, and the brightness of the morning star; now the being clothed in white raiment, and not having the name blotted out of the book of life, and being made in the temple of God a pillar with the inscription on it of the name of God and of the Lord, and of the heavenly Jerusalem; now a sitting with the Lord on His throne,-which once was persistently refused to the sons of Zebedee.[fn-110-P11081_3146545:86-nf] Who, pray, are these so blessed conquerors, but martyrs in the strict sense of the word? For indeed theirs are the victories whose also are the fights; theirs, however, are the fights whose also is the blood. But the souls of the martyrs both peacefully rest in the meantime under the altar,[fn-110-P11082_3146859:87-nf] and support their patience by the assured hope of revenge; and, clothed in their robes, wear the dazzling halo of brightness, until others also may fully share in their glory. For yet again a countless throng are revealed, clothed in white and distinguished by palms of victory, celebrating their triumph doubtless over Antichrist, since one of the elders says, \"These are they who come out of that great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.\"[fn-110-P11083_3147370:88-nf] For the flesh is the clothing of the soul.

But by this line of argument we have shown why Christ loved John more than Peter, not why Peter loved Christ more than John. For if Christ loveth us more in the world to come, where we shall live unendingly with Him, than in the present, from which we are in the course of being rescued, that we may be always in the other, it does not follow on that account that we shall love Him less when better ourselves; since we can in no possible way be better ourselves, save by loving Him more. Why was it, then, that John loved Him less than Peter, if he signified that life, wherein He must be more abundantly loved, but because on that very account it was said, \"I will that he tarry,\" that is wait, \"till I come;\" for we have not yet the love itself, which will then be greater far, but are expecting that future, that we may have it when He shall come? Just as in his own epistle the same apostle declares, \"It has not yet appeared what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is.\"[fn-39-P3922_2167349:23-nf] Then accordingly shall we love the more that which we shall see. But the Lord Himself. in His predestinating knowledge, loveth more that future life of ours that is yet to come, such as He knows it will be hereafter in us, in order that by so loving us He may draw us onward to its possession. Wherefore, as all the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth,[fn-39-P3923_2167723:24-nf] we know our present misery, because we feel it; and therefore we love more the mercy of the Lord, which we wish to be exhibited in our deliverance from misery, and we ask and experience it daily,especially in the remission of sins: this it is that was signified by Peter, as loving more, but less beloved; because Christ loveth us less in our misery than in our blessedness. But the contemplation of the truth, such as it then shall be, we love less, because as yet we neither know nor possess it: this was signified by John as loving less, and therefore waiting both for that state itself, and for the perfecting in us of that love to Him, to which He is entitled, till the Lord come; but loved the more, because that it is, which is symbolized by him, that maketh him blessed.","title":"Tractate CXXIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_47_book_iii_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"96","folder":"ANF-04","text":"1. Now, respecting the end of the world and the consummation of all things, we have stated in the preceding pages, to the best of our ability, so far as the authority of holy Scripture enabled us, what we deem sufficient for purposes of instruction; and we shall here only add a few admonitory remarks, since the order of investigation has brought us back to the subject. The highest good, then, after the attainment of which the whole of rational nature is seeking, which is also called the end of all blessings,[fn-72-P7287_1644495:400-nf] is defined by many philosophers as follows: The highest good, they say, is to become as like to God as possible. But this definition I regard not so much as a discovery of theirs, as a view derived from holy Scripture. For this is pointed out by Moses, before all other philosophers, when he describes the first creation of man in these words: \"And God said, Let Us make man in Our own image, and after Our likeness; \"[fn-72-P7288_1644957:401-nf] and then he adds the words: \"So God created man in His own image: in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them, and He blessed them.\"[fn-72-P7289_1645133:402-nf] Now the expression, \"In the image[fn-72-P7290_1645190:403-nf] of God created He him,\" without any mention of the word\" likeness,\"[fn-72-P7291_1645272:404-nf] conveys no other meaning than this, that man received the dignity of God's image at his first creation; but that the perfection of his likeness has been reserved for the consummation,-namely, that he might acquire it for himself by the exercise of his own diligence in the imitation of God, the possibility of attaining to perfection being granted him at the beginning through the dignity of the divine image, and the perfect realization of the divine likeness being reached in the end by the fulfilment of the (necessary) works. Now, that such is the case, the Apostle John points out more clearly and unmistakeably, when he makes this declaration: \"Little children, we do not yet know what we shall be; but if a revelation be made to us from the Saviour, ye will say, without any doubt, we shall be like Him.\"[fn-72-P7292_1646103:405-nf] By which expression he points out with the utmost certainty, that not only was the end of all things to be hoped for, which he says was still unknown to him, but also the likeness to God, which will be conferred in proportion to the completeness of our deserts. The Lord Himself, in the Gospel, not only declares that these same results are future, but that they are to be brought about by His own intercession, He Himself deigning to obtain them from the Father for His disciples, saying, \"Father, I will that where I am, these also may be with Me; and as Thou and I are one, they also may be one in Us.\"[fn-72-P7293_1646736:406-nf] In which the divine likeness itself already appears to advance, if we may so express ourselves, and from being merely similar, to become the same,[fn-72-P7294_1646917:407-nf] because undoubtedly in the consummation or end God is \"all and in all.\" And with reference to this, it is made a question by some[fn-72-P7295_1647076:408-nf] whether the nature of bodily matter, although cleansed and purified, and rendered altogether spiritual, does not seem either to offer an obstruction towards attaining the dignity of the (divine) likeness, or to the property of unity,[fn-72-P7296_1649805:409-nf] because neither can a corporeal nature appear capable of any resemblance to a divine nature which is certainly incorporeal; nor can it be truly and deservedly designated one with it, especially since we are taught by the truths of our religion that that which alone is one, viz., the Son with the Father, must be referred to a peculiarity of the (divine) nature.","title":"Book III.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":3,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_45_book_xxxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"18.

For \"He was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified.\" We have proof also that He leads into all truth, for the only way to truth is by love, and \"the love of God,\" says the apostle, \"is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost who is given unto us.\"[fn-25-P2523_1524701:40-nf] We show, too, that in the words, \"when that which is perfect is come,\" Paul spoke of the perfection in the enjoyment of eternal life. For in the same place he says: \"Now we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face.\"[fn-25-P2524_1524942:41-nf] You cannot reasonably maintain that we see God face to face here. Therefore that which is perfect has not come to you. It is thus clear what the apostle thought on this subject.

Again, the words, \"The world cannot receive Him,\" plainly point to those who are usually called the world in Scripture-the lovers of the world, the wicked, or carnal; of whom the apostle says: \"The natural man perceiveth not the things which are of the Spirit of God.\"[fn-25-P2526_1525788:43-nf] Those are said to be of this world who can understand nothing beyond material things, which are the objects of sense in this world; as is the case with you, when, in your admiration of the sun and moon, you suppose all divine things to resemble them.

To profess himself to be without sin, is full of peril; and not only full of peril, but also full of error': \"We deceive ourselves,\" saith he, \"and the truth is not in us, if we say that we have no sin.\" But oh that thou hadst none, and saidst this! for then wouldest thou say truly, and in uttering the truth wouldest have not so much as a vestige of wrong to be afraid of. But, that thou doest ill if thou say so, is because it is a lie that thou sayest. \"The truth,\" saith he, \"is not in us, if we say that we have no sin.\" He saith not, \"Have not had;\" lest haply it should seem to be spoken of the past life. For the man here hath had sins: but from the time that he was born of God, he has begun not to have sins. If it were so, there would be no question to embarrass us. For we should say, We have been sinners, but now we are justified: we have had sin, but now we have none.

If John was not born of God, John, of whom ye have heard that he lay in the Lord's bosom; does any man dare engage for himself that in him has taken place that regeneration which it was not granted to that man to have, to whom it was granted to lie in the bosom of the Lord?

But let us distinguish God's different ways of hearing prayer. For we find some not heard for their wish, heard for salvation: and again some we find heard for their wish, not heard for salvation. Mark this difference, hold fast this example of a man not heard for his wish but heard for salvation. Hear the apostle Paul; for what is the hearing of prayer unto salvation, God Himself showed him: \"Sufficient for thee,\" saith He, \"is my grace; for strength is perfected in weakness.\" Thou hast besought, hast cried, hast thrice cried: the very cry thou didst raise once for all I heard, I turned not away mine ears from thee; I know what I should do: thou wouldest have it taken away, the healing thing by which thou art burned; I know the infirmity by which thou art burdened. Well then: here is a man who was heard for salvation, while as to his will he was not heard. Where find we persons heard for their will, not heard for salvation? Do we find, think we, some wicked, some impious man, heard of God for his will, not heard for salvation? If I put to you the instance of some man, perchance thou wilt say to me, \"It is thou that callest him wicked, for he was righteous; had he not been righteous, his prayer would not have been heard by God.\"The instance I am about to allege is of one, of whose iniquity and impiety none can doubt. The devil himself: he asked for Job, and received.[fn-43-P4379_2369045:27-nf] Have ye not here also heard concerning the devil, that \"he that committeth sin is of the devil\"?[fn-43-P4380_2369163:28-nf] Not that the devil created, but that the sinner imitates. Is it not said of him, \"He stood not in the truth\"?[fn-43-P4381_2369296:29-nf] Is not even he \"that old serpent,\" who, through the woman pledged the first man in the drink of poison?[fn-43-P4382_2369420:30-nf] Who even in the case of Job, kept for him his wife, that by her the husband might be, not comforted, but tempted? The devil asked for a holy man, to tempt him; and he received: the apostle asked that the thorn in the flesh might be taken from him, and he received not. But the apostle was more heard than the devil. For the apostle was heard for salvation, though not for his wish: the devil was heard for his wish, but for damnation. For that Job was yielded up to him to be tempted, was in order that by his standing the proof the devil should be tormented. But this, my brethren, we find not only in the Old Testament books, but also in the Gospel. The demons besought the Lord, when He expelled them from the man, that they might be permitted to go into the swine. Should the Lord not have power to tell them not to approach even those creatures? For, had it not been His will to permit this, they were not about to rebel against the King of heaven and earth. But with a view to a certain mystery, with a certain[fn-43-P4383_2370457:31-nf] ulterior meaning, He let the demons go into the swine: to show that the devil hath dominion in them that lead the life of swine.[fn-43-P4384_2370612:32-nf] Demons then were heard in their request; was the apostle not heard? Or rather (what is truer) shall we say, The apostle was heard, the demons not heard?

That of such a kind are some, nay very many, even within the Church, is testified both by Paul the apostle and by Cyprian the bishop. Why, then, do they baptize? Why also are some, who \"renounce the world in words and not in deeds,\" baptized without being converted from a life like this, and not rebaptized when they are converted? And as to what he says with such indignation, \"See the kind of things to which the Church is compelled to assent, being forced to communicate without baptism or the remission of sins,\" he could never have used such expressions had there not been the other bishops who elsewhere forced men to such things.

Wherefore also to those capable of perceiving he showed resurrection, that of the life still in the flesh, creeping on its belly.

And the divine apostle furnishes the rule for the Gnostic in these words, writing as follows: \"For I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, to be content. I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to lack. I can do all things through Him who strengtheneth me.\"[fn-68-P6888_2110362:147-nf] And also when discussing with others in order to put them, to shame, he does not shrink from saying, \"But call to mind the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions; partly, whilst ye were made a gazing-stock, both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used. For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took with joy the spoiling of your goods, knowing that you have a better and enduring substance. Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after doing the will of God, ye may obtain the promise. For yet a little while, and He that cometh will come, and will not tarry. Now the just shall live by faith: and if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are not of them that draw back unto perdition, but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.\"[fn-68-P6889_2111342:148-nf] He then brings forward a swarm of divine examples. For was it not \"by faith,\" he says, this endurance, that they acted nobly who \"had trial of mockeries and scourgings, and, moreover, of bonds and imprisonments? They were stoned, they were tempted, were slain with the sword. They wandered about in sheep-skins and goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts, in mountains, in dens, and caves of the earth. And all having received a good report, through faith, received not the promise of God\" (what is expressed by a parasiopesis is left to be understood, viz., \"alone \"). He adds accordingly, \"God having provided some better thing for us (for He was good), that they should not without us be made perfect. Wherefore also, having encompassing us such a cloud,\" holy and transparent, \"of witnesses, laying aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, let us run with patience the race set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.\"[fn-68-P6890_2112408:149-nf] Since, then, he specifies one salvation in Christ of the righteous,[fn-68-P6891_2112510:150-nf] and of us he has expressed the former unambiguously, and saying nothing less respecting Moses, adds, \"Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he had respect to the recompense of the reward. By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured as seeing Him who is invisible.\"[fn-68-P6892_2112908:151-nf] The divine Wisdom says of the martyrs, \"They seemed in the eyes of the foolish to die, and their departure was reckoned a calamity, and their migration from us an affliction.

For though in the sight of men they were punished, their hope was full of immortality.\"[fn-68-P6893_2113261:152-nf] He then adds, teaching martyrdom to be a glorious purification, \"And being chastened a little, they shall be benefited much; because God proved them,\" that is, suffered them to be tried, to put them to the proof, and to put to shame the author of their trial, \"and found them worthy of Himself,\" plainly to be called sons. \"As gold in the furnace He proved them, and as a whole burned-offering of sacrifice He accepted them.

For you have the fruits of an answer pointed out by our Lord's words in the case of the agreement of two persons; as it is said: \"If two of you shall agree upon earth touching anything for which they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.\"[fn-49-P4971_1790561:49-nf] You have another in the fulness of faith, which is compared to a grain of mustard-seed. \"For,\" He says, \"if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain: Be thou removed, and it shall be removed; and nothing shall be impossible to you.\"[fn-49-P4972_1790850:50-nf] You have it in continuance in prayer, which the Lord's words call, by reason of unwearied perseverance in petitioning, importunity: \"For, verily, I say unto you that if not because of his friendship, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as much as he needs.\"[fn-49-P4973_1791154:51-nf] You have it in the fruits of almsgiving: \"Shut up alms in the heart of the poor and it shall pray for thee in the time of tribulation.\"[fn-49-P4974_1791316:52-nf] You have it in the purifying of life and in works of mercy, as it is said: \"Loose the bands of wickedness, undo the bundles that oppress;\" and after a few words in which the barrenness of an unfruitful fast is rebuked, \"then,\" he says, \"thou shall call and the Lord shall hear thee; thou shalt cry, and He shall say, Here am I.\"[fn-49-P4975_1791669:53-nf] Sometimes also excess of trouble causes it to be heard, as it is said: \"When I was in trouble I called unto the Lord, and He heard me;\"[fn-49-P4976_1791838:54-nf] and again: \"Afflict not the stranger for if he crieth unto Me, I will hear him, for I am merciful.\"[fn-49-P4977_1791961:55-nf] You see then in how many ways the gift of an answer may be obtained, so that no one need be crushed by the despair of his conscience for securing those things which are salutary and eternal. For if in contemplating our wretchedness I admit that we are utterly destitute of all those virtues which we mentioned above, and that we have neither that laudable agreement of two persons, nor that faith which is compared to a grain of mustard seed, nor those works of piety which the prophet describes, surely we cannot be without that importunity which He supplies to all who desire it, owing to which alone the Lord promises that He will give whatever He has been prayed to give. And therefore we ought without unbelieving hesitation to persevere, and not to have the least doubt that by continuing in them we shall obtain all those things which we have asked according to the mind of God. For the Lord, in His desire to grant what is heavenly and eternal, urges us to constrain Him as it were by our importunity, as He not only does not despise or reject the importunate, but actually welcomes and praises them, and most graciously promises to grant whatever they have perseveringly hoped for; saying, \"Ask and ye shall receive: seek and ye shall find: knock and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it shall be opened;\"[fn-49-P4978_1793384:56-nf] and again: \"All things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive, and nothing shall be impossible to you.\"[fn-49-P4979_1793529:57-nf] And therefore even if all the grounds for being heard which we have mentioned are altogether wanting, at any rate the earnestness of importunity may animate us, as this is placed in the power of any one who wills without the difficulties of any merits or labours. But let not any suppliant doubt that he certainly will not be heard, so long as he doubts whether he is heard. But that this also shall be sought from the Lord unweariedly, we are taught by the example of the blessed Daniel, as, though he was heard from the first day on which he began to pray, he only obtained the result of his petition after one and twenty days.[fn-49-P4980_1794179:58-nf] Wherefore we also ought not to grow slack in the earnestness of the prayers we have begun, if we fancy that the answer comes but slowly, for fear lest perhaps the gift of the answer be in God's providence delayed, or the angel, who was to bring the Divine blessing to us, may when he comes forth from the Presence of the Almighty be hindered by the resistance of the devil, as it is certain that he cannot transmit and bring to us the desired boon, if he finds that we slack off from the earnestness of the petition made. And this would certainly have happened to the above mentioned prophet unless he had with incomparable steadfastness prolonged and persevered in his prayers until the twenty-first day. Let us then not be at all cast down by despair from the confidence of this faith of ours, even when we fancy that we are far from having obtained what we prayed for, and let us not have any doubts about the Lord's promise where He says: \"All things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing, ye shall receive.\"[fn-49-P4981_1795222:59-nf] For it is well for us to consider this saying of the blessed Evangelist John, by which the ambiguity of this question is clearly solved: \"This is,\" he says, \"the confidence which we have in Him, that whatsoever we ask according to His will, He heareth us.\"[fn-49-P4982_1795789:60-nf] He bids us then have a full and undoubting confidence of the answer only in those things which are not for our own advantage or for temporal comforts, but are in conformity to the Lord's will. And we are also taught to put this into our prayers by the Lord's Prayer, where we say \"Thy will be done,\"-Thine not ours. For if we also remember these words of the Apostle that \"we know not what to pray for as we ought\"[fn-49-P4983_1796228:61-nf] we shall see that we sometimes ask for things opposed to our salvation and that we are most providentially refused our requests by Him who sees what is good for us with greater right and truth than we can. And it is clear that this also happened to the teacher of the Gentiles when he prayed that the messenger of Satan who had been for his good allowed by the Lord's will to buffet him, might be removed, saying: \"For which I besought the Lord thrice that he might depart from me. And He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee, for strength is made perfect in weakness.\"[fn-49-P4984_1796840:62-nf] And this feeling even our Lord expressed when He prayed in the character[fn-49-P4985_1796933:63-nf] of man which He had taken, that He might give us a form of prayer as other things also by His example; saying thus: \"Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt,\"[fn-49-P4986_1797176:64-nf] though certainly His will was not discordant with His Father's will, \"For He had come to save what was lost and to give His life a ransom for many;\"[fn-49-P4987_1797346:65-nf] as He Himself says: \"No man taketh my life from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again.\"[fn-49-P4988_1797507:66-nf] In which character there is in the thirty-ninth Psalm the following sung by the blessed David, of the Unity of will which He ever maintained with the Father: \"To do Thy will: O My God, I am willing.\"[fn-49-P4989_1797727:67-nf] For even if we read of the Father: \"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son,\"[fn-49-P4990_1797852:68-nf] we find none the less of the Son: \"Who gave Himself for our sins.\"[fn-49-P4991_1797935:69-nf] And as it is said of the One: \"Who spared not His own Son, but gave Him for all of us,\"[fn-49-P4992_1798044:70-nf] so it is written of the other: \"He was offered because He Himself willed it.\"[fn-49-P4993_1798146:71-nf] And it is shown that the will of the Father and of the Son is in all things one, so that even in the actual mystery of the Lord's resurrection we are taught that there was no discord of operation. For just as the blessed Apostle declares that the Father brought about the resurrection of His body, saying: \"And God the Father, who raised Him from the dead,\"[fn-49-P4994_1798569:72-nf] so also the Son testifies that He Himself will raise again the Temple of His body, saying: \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again.\"[fn-49-P4995_1798808:73-nf] And therefore we being instructed by all these examples of our Lord which have been enumerated ought to end our supplications also with the same prayer, and always to subjoin this clause to all our petitions: \"Nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt.\"[fn-49-P4996_1799084:74-nf] But it is clear enough that one who does not[fn-49-P4997_1799204:75-nf] pray with attention of mind cannot observe that threefold reverence[fn-49-P4998_1800699:76-nf] which is usually practised in the assemblies of the brethren at the close of service.","title":"IX.

Now there is a great difference between the sin of one who is angry, and the cruelty of one who holds another in hatred. For even with our children are we angry; but who is ever found to hate his children? Among the very cattle too, the cow in a sort of weariness will sometimes in anger drive away her sucking calf; but anon she embraces it with all the affection of a mother. She is in a way disgusted with it, when she butts at it; yet when she misses it, she will seek after it. Nor do we discipline our children otherwise, than with a degree of anger and indignation; yet we should not discipline them at all, but in love to them. So far then is every one who is angry from hating; that sometimes one would be rather convicted of hating, if he were not angry. For suppose a child wishes to play in some river's stream, by whose force he would be like to perish; if you see this, and patiently suffer it, this would be hating; your patient suffering him, is his death. How far better is it to be angry and correct him, than by not being angry to suffer him to perish! Above all things then is hatred to be avoided, and the beam to be cast out of the eye. Great is the difference indeed between one's exceeding due limits in some words through anger, which he afterwards wipes off by repenting of it; and the keeping an insidious purpose shut up in the heart. Great, lastly, the difference between these words of Scripture; \"Mine eye is disordered because of anger.\"[fn-44-P4440_1886449:1-nf] Whereas of the other it is said, \"Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer.\"[fn-44-P4441_1886569:2-nf] Great is the difference between an eye disordered, and clean put out.

Paul, for instance, `separated an Apostle for the Gospel, which the Lord had promised afore by the Prophets[fn-62-P6227_2485163:351-nf] ,' was thereby made subordinate to the Gospel, of which he was made minister, and John, being chosen to prepare the Lord's way, was made subordinate to the Lord; but the Lord, not being made subordinate to any reason why He should be Word, save only that He is the Father's Offspring and Only-begotten Wisdom, when He becomes man, then assigns the reason why He is about to take flesh.

To provide against this also, He sends His own Son, and He becomes Son of Man, by taking created flesh; that, since all were under sentence of death, He, being other than them all, might Himself for all offer to death His own body; and that henceforth, as if all land died through Him, the word of that sentence might be accomplished (for `all died[fn-63-P6366_2537229:472-nf] ' in Christ), and all through Him might thereupon become free from sin and from the curse which came upon it, and might truly abide[fn-63-P6367_2537382:473-nf] for ever, risen from the dead and clothed in immortality and incorruption.

What, brethren, does He promise believers? \"And ye shall know the truth.\" Why so? Had they not come to such knowledge when the Lord was speaking? If they had not, how did they believe? They believed, not because they knew, but that they might come to know. For we believe in order that we may know, we do not know in order that we may believe. For what we shall yet know, neither eye hath seen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entered the heart of man.[fn-17-P1711_1088569:14-nf] For what is faith, but believing what you see not? Faith then is to believe what you see not; truth, to see what you have believed, as He Himself saith in a certain place. The Lord then walked on earth, first of all, for the creation of faith. He was man, He was made in a low condition. He was seen by all, but not by all was He known. By many was He rejected, by the multitude was He slain, by few was He mourned; and yet even by those who mourned Him, His true being was still unrecognized. All this is the beginning as it were of faith's lineaments and future up-building. As the Lord, referring thereto, saith in a certain place, \"He that loveth me keepeth my commandments; and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.\"[fn-17-P1712_1089387:15-nf] They certainly already saw the person to whom they were listening; and yet to them, if they loved Him, does He give it as a promise that they should see Him. So also here, \"Ye shall know the truth.\" How so? Is that not the truth which Thou hast been speaking? The truth it is, but as yet it is only believed, not beheld. If you abide in that which is believed, you shall attain to that which is seen. Hence John himself, the holy evangelist, says in his epistle, \"Dearly beloved, we are the sons of God; but it is not yet apparent what we shall be.\" We are so already, and something we shall be. What more shall we be than we are? Listen: \"It is not yet apparent what we shall be: [but] we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him.\" How? \"For we shall see Him as He is.\"[fn-17-P1713_1090192:16-nf] A great promise, but the reward of faith.

As He laid down His life for us, so ought we also, for the edification of others, and the maintenance of the faith,[fn-20-P2012_1247258:5-nf] to lay down our lives for the brethren. To the same effect He said to Peter, whom He wished to make a good shepherd. not in Peter's own person, but as a member of His body: \"Peter, lovest thou me? Feed my sheep.\" This He did once, again, and a third time, to the disciple's sorrow. And when the Lord had questioned him as often as lie judged it needful, that he who had thrice denied might thrice confess Him, and had a third time given him the charge to feed His sheep, He said to him, \"When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shall be old, thou shall stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.\" And the evangelist has explained the Lord's meaning: \"But this spake He, signifying by what death he should glorify God.\"[fn-20-P2013_1248161:6-nf] \"Feed my sheep\" applies, then, to this, that thou shouldst lay down thy life for my sheep.","title":"Tractate XLVII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_52_tractate_xlvii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"11. Let us turn, then, to what is true and easily understood. Take the case of any man, who does not consist of the word and soul and flesh, but only of soul and flesh; and let us inquire how any such man lays down his life. Can no ordinary man do so? Thou mayest say to me: No man has power to lay down his life [soul], and to take it again. But were not a man able to lay down his life, the Apostle John would not say, \"As Christ laid down his life for us, even so ought we also to lay down our lives for the brethren.\"[fn-20-P2045_1266179:29-nf] Therefore may we also (if only we are filled with His courage, for without Him we can do nothing) lay down our lives for the brethren. When some holy martyr has laid down his life for the brethren, who laid it down, and what laid he down? If we understand this, we shall perceive in what sense it was said byChrist, \"I have power to lay down my life.\"Art thou prepared, O man, to die for Christ? I am prepared, he replies. Let me repeat the question in other words. Art thou prepared to lay down thy life for Christ? And to these words he makes me the same reply, I am prepared, as he had, when I said, Art thou prepared to die? To lay down one's life [soul], is, then, the same as to die. But in whose behalf is the sacrifice in this case? For all men, when they die, lay down theirlife; but it is not all who lay it down for Christ. And no one has power to resume what he has laid down. But Christ both laid it down for us, and did so when it pleased Him; and when it pleased Him, He took it again. To lay down one's soul then, is to die. As also the Apostle Peter said to the Lord: \"I will lay down my life [soul] for Thy sake;\"[fn-20-P2046_1267332:30-nf] that is, I will die for Thy sake. View it, then, as referable to the flesh: the flesh layeth down its life, and the flesh taketh it again; not, indeed, the flesh by its own power, but by the power of Him that inhabiteth it. The flesh, then, layeth down its life in expiring. Look at the Lord Himself on the cross: He said, \"I thirst:\" those who were present dipped a sponge in vinegar, fastened it to a reed, and applied it to His mouth; then, having received it, He said, \"It is finished;\" meaning, All is fulfilled which had been prophesied regarding me as, prior to my death, still in the future. And because He had the power, when He pleased, to lay down His life, after He had said, \"It is finished,\" what adds the evangelist? \"And He bowed His head, and gave up the spirit.\"[fn-20-P2047_1268134:31-nf] This is to lay down the soul [life]. Only let your Charity attend to this. \"He bowed His head, and gave up the spirit.\" Who gave up what gave He up? He gave up the spirit; His flesh gave it up. What means, the flesh gave it up? The flesh sent it forth, breathed it out. For so, in becoming separated from the spirit, we are said to expire. Just as getting outside the paternal soil is to be expatriated, turning aside from the track is to deviate; so to become separated from the spirit is to expire; and thatspirit is the soul [life]. Accordingly, when the soul quits the flesh, and the flesh remains without the soul, then is a man said to lay down his soul [his human life]. When did Christ lay down His life? When it pleased the Word. For sovereign authority resided in the Word; and therein lay the power to determine when the flesh should lay down its life, and when it should take it again.","title":"Tractate XLVII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_84_sermon_lxvii_cxvii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"17","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"15. I render unspeakable thanks to our Lord God, that He hath vouchsafed, at your prayers, to deliver my infirmity from this most perplexed and difficult place. Yet above all things remember this, that the Creator transcends indescribably whatever we could gather from the creature, whether by the bodily senses, or the thought of the mind.

For we are not God; but with the mind or the interior eye of the heart we can see God.

For Moses likewise saw Him, and yet we find him saying to Him whom he saw, \"If I have found grace in Thy sight, show me now Thyself, that I may clearly see Thee;\"[fn-23-P2339_1421153:25-nf] for he saw Him not as He is.

He showed Himself, therefore, even before His incarnation, to the eyes of men, as it pleased Him, in the creature-form at His command, but not as He is.
