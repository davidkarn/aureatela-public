{"verses":["Behold what manner of charity the Father hath bestowed upon us,\nthat we should be called and should be the sons of God.  Therefore the\nworld knoweth not us, because it knew not him.","Dearly beloved, we are now the sons of God:  and it hath not yet\nappeared what we shall be.  We know that when he shall appear we shall\nbe like to him:  because we shall see him as he is.","And every one that hath this hope in him sanctifieth himself, as\nhe also is holy.","Whosoever committeth sin committeth also iniquity.  And sin is\niniquity.","And you know that he appeared to take away our sins:  and in him\nthere is no sin.","Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not:  and whosoever sinneth hath\nnot seen him nor known him.","Little children, let no man deceive you.  He that doth justice is\njust, even as he is just.","He that committeth sin is of the devil:  for the devil sinneth from\nthe beginning.  For this purpose the Son of God appeared, that he might\ndestroy the works of the devil.","Whosoever is born of God committeth not sin:  for his seed abideth\nin him.  And he cannot sin, because he is born of God.","In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the\ndevil.  Whosoever is not just is not of God, or he that loveth not his\nbrother.","For this is the declaration which you have heard from the\nbeginning, that you should love one another.","Not as Cain, who was of the wicked one and killed his brother.\nAnd wherefore did he kill him?  Because his own works were wicked:  and\nhis brother's just.","Wonder not, brethren, if the world hate you.","We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love\nthe brethren.  He that loveth not abideth in death.","Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer.  And you know that no\nmurderer hath eternal life abiding in himself.","In this we have known the charity of God, because he hath laid\ndown his life for us:  and we ought to lay down our lives for the\nbrethren.","He that hath the substance of this world and shall see his\nbrother in need and shall shut up his bowels from him:  how doth the\ncharity of God abide in him?","My little children, let us not love in word nor in tongue, but in\ndeed and in truth.","In this we know that we are of the truth and in his sight shall\npersuade our hearts.","For if our heart reprehend us, God is greater than our heart and\nknoweth all things.","Dearly beloved, if our heart do not reprehend us, we have\nconfidence towards God.","And whatsoever we shall ask, we shall receive of him:  because we\nkeep his commandments and do those things which are pleasing in his\nsight.","And this is his commandment:  That we should believe in the name\nof his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, as he hath given\ncommandment unto us.","And he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him, and he in\nhim.  And in this we know that he abideth in us by the Spirit which he\nhath given us."]}
