{"verses":["The Ancient to the lady Elect and her children, whom I love in the\ntruth:  and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth,","For the sake of the truth which dwelleth in us and shall be with\nus for ever.","Grace be with you, mercy and peace from God the Father and from\nChrist Jesus the Son of the Father:  in truth and charity.","I was exceeding glad that I found of thy children walking in\ntruth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.","And now I beseech thee, lady, not as writing a new commandment to\nthee, but that which we have had from the beginning, that we love one\nanother.","And this is charity:  That we walk according to his commandments.\nFor this is the commandment that, as you have heard from the beginning,\nyou should walk in the same:","For many seducers are gone out into the world who confess not that\nJesus Christ is come in the flesh.  This is a seducer and an antichrist.","Look to yourselves, that you lose not the things which you have\nwrought:  but that you may receive a full reward.","Whosoever revolteth and continueth not in the doctrine of Christ\nhath not God.  He that continueth in the doctrine, the same hath both\nthe Father and the Son.","If any man come to you and bring not this doctrine, receive him\nnot into the house nor say to him:  God speed you.","For he that saith unto him:  God speed you, communicateth with his\nwicked works.","Having more things to write unto you, I would not by paper and\nink:  for I hope that I shall be with you and speak face to face, that\nyour joy may be full.","The children of thy sister Elect salute thee."]}
