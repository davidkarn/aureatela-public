{"verses":["Now when David was dwelling in his house, he said to Nathan the\nprophet:  Behold I dwell in a house of cedar:  and the ark of the\ncovenant of the Lord is under skins.","And Nathan said to David:  Do all that is in thy heart:  for God is\nwith thee.","Now that night the word of God came to Nathan, saying:","Go, and speak to David my servant:  Thus saith the Lord:  Thou\nshalt not build me a house to dwell in.","For I have not remained in a house from the time that I brought\nup Israel, to this day:  but I have been always changing places in a\ntabernacle, and in a tent,","Abiding with all Israel.  Did I ever speak to any one, of all the\njudges of Israel whom I charged to feed my people, saying:  Why have you\nnot built me a house of cedar?","Now therefore thus shalt thou say to my servant David:  Thus saith\nthe Lord of hosts:  I took thee from the pastures, from following the\nflock, that thou shouldst be ruler of my people Israel.","And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone:  and have\nslain all thy enemies before thee, and have made thee a name like that\nof one of the great ones that are renowned in the earth.","And I have given a place my people Israel:  they shall be planted,\nand shall dwell therein, and shall be moved no more, neither shall the\nchildren of iniquity waste them, as at the beginning,","Since the days that I gave judges to my people Israel, and have\nhumbled all thy enemies.  And I declare to thee, that the Lord will\nbuild thee a house.","And when thou shalt have ended thy days to go to thy fathers, I\nwill raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons:  and I\nwill establish his kingdom.","He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for\never.","I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son:  and I\nwill not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was\nbefore thee.","But I will settle him in my house, and in my kingdom for ever:\nand his throne shall be most firm for ever.","According to all these words, and according to all this vision,\nso did Nathan speak to David.","And king David came and sat before the Lord, and said:  Who am I,\nO Lord God, and what is my house, that thou shouldst give such things\nto me?","But even this hath seemed little in thy sight, and therefore\nthou hast also spoken concerning the house of thy servant for the time\nto come:  and hast made me remarkable above all men, O Lord God.","What can David add more, seeing thou hast thus glorified thy\nservant, and known him?","O Lord, for thy servant's sake, according to thy own heart, thou\nhast shewn all this magnificence, and wouldst have all the great things\nto be known.","O Lord there is none like thee:  and here is no other God beside\nthee, of all whom we have heard of with our ears.","For what other nation is there upon earth like thy people\nIsrael, whom God went to deliver, and make a people for himself, and by\nhis greatness and terrors cast out nations before their face whom he\nhad delivered out of Egypt?","And thou hast made thy people Israel to be thy own people for\never, and thou, O Lord, art become their God.","Now therefore, O Lord, let the word which thou hast spoken to\nthy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do\nas thou hast said.","And let thy name remain and be magnified for ever:  and let it be\nsaid:  The Lord of hosts is God of Israel, and the house of David his\nservant remaineth before him.","For thou, O Lord my God, hast revealed to the ear of thy\nservant, that thou wilt build him a house:  and therefore thy servant\nhath found confidence to pray before thee.","And now O Lord, thou art God:  and thou hast promised to thy\nservant such great benefits.","And thou hast begun to bless the house of thy servant, that it\nmay be always before thee:  for seeing thou blessest it, O Lord, it\nshall be blessed for ever."]}
