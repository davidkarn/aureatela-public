{"verses":["David consulted with the captains of thousands, and of hundreds,\nand with all the commanders.","And he said to all the assembly of Israel:  If it please you; and\nif the words which I speak come from the Lord our God, let us send to\nthe rest of our brethren into all the countries of Israel, and to the\npriests, and the Levites, that dwell in the suburbs of the cities, to\ngather themselves to us,","And let us bring again the ark of our God to us:  for we sought it\nnot in the days of Saul.","And all the multitude answered that it should be so:  for the word\npleased all the people.","So David assembled all Israel from Sihor of Egypt, even to the\nentering into Emath, to bring the ark of God from Cariathiarim.","And David went up with all the men of Israel to the hill of\nCariathiarim which is in Juda, to bring thence the ark of the Lord God\nsitting upon the cherubims, where his name is called upon.","And they carried the ark of God upon a new cart out of the house\nof Abinadab.  And Oza and his brother drove the cart.","And David and all Israel played before God with all their might\nwith hymns, and with harps, and with psalteries, and timbrels, and\ncymbals, and trumpets,","And when they came to the floor of Chidon, Oza put forth his\nhand, to hold up the ark:  for the ox being wanton had made it lean a\nlittle on one side.","And the Lord was angry with Oza, and struck him, because he had\ntouched the ark; and he died there before the Lord.","And David was troubled because the Lord had divided Oza:  and he\ncalled that place the Breach of Oza to this day.","And he feared God at that time, saying:  How can I bring in the\nark of God to me?","And therefore he brought it not home to himself, that is, into\nthe city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the\nGethite.","And the ark of God remained in the house of Obededom three\nmonths:  and the Lord blessed his house, and all that he had."]}
