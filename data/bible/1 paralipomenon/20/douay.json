But David stayed at Jerusalem, when Joab smote\nRabba, and destroyed it.","And David took the crown of Melchom from his head, and found in\nit a talent weight of gold, and most precious stones, and he made\nhimself a diadem of it:  he took also the spoils of the city which were\nvery great.","And the people that were therein he brought out:  and made\nharrows, and sleds, and chariots of iron to go over them, so that they\nwere cut and bruised to pieces:  in this manner David dealt with all the\ncities of the children of Ammon:  and he returned with all his people to\nJerusalem.","After this there arose a war at Gazer against the Philistines:  in\nwhich Sabachai the Husathite slew Saphai of the race of Raphaim, and\nhumbled them.","Another battle also was fought against the Philistines, in which\nAdeodatus the son of Saltus a Bethlehemite slew the brother of Goliath\nthe Gethite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.","There was another battle also in Geth, in which there was a man\nof great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on\neach hand and foot:  who also was born of the stock of Rapha.","He reviled Israel:  but Jonathan the son of Samaa the brother of\nDavid slew him.  These were the sons of Rapha in Geth, who fell by the\nhand of David and his servants."]}
