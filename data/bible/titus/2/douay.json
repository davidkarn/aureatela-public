{"verses":["But speak thou the things that become sound doctrine:","That the aged men be sober, chaste, prudent, sound in faith, in\nlove, in patience.","The aged women, in like manner, in holy attire, not false\naccusers, not given to much wine, teaching well:","That they may teach the young women to be wise, to love their\nhusbands, to love their children.","To be discreet, chaste, sober, having a care of the house, gentle,\nobedient to their husbands:  that the word of God be not blasphemed.","Young men, in like manner, exhort that they be sober.","In all things shew thyself an example of good works, in doctrine,\nin integrity, in gravity,","The sound word that can not be blamed:  that he who is on the\ncontrary part may be afraid, having no evil to say of us.","Exhort servants to be obedient to their masters:  in all things\npleasing, not gainsaying:","Not defrauding, but in all things shewing good fidelity, that\nthey may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.","For the grace of God our Saviour hath appeared to all men:","Instructing us, that, denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we\nshould live soberly and justly and godly in this world,","Looking for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great\nGod and our Saviour Jesus Christ.","Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all\niniquity and might cleanse to himself a people acceptable, a pursuer of\ngood works.","These things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority.  Let\nno man despise thee."]}
