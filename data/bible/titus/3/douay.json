And these things I will have thee affirm\nconstantly, that they who believe in God may be careful to excel in\ngood works.  These things are good and profitable unto men.","But avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and\nstrivings about the law.

For there I have determined to winter.","Send forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollo, with care that nothing\nbe wanting to them.","And let our men also learn to excel in good works for necessary\nuses:  that they be not unfruitful.","All that are with me salute thee.  Salute them that love us in the\nfaith.  The grace of God be with you all.  Amen."]}
