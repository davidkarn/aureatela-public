{"verses":["Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according\nto the faith of the elect of God and the acknowledging of the truth,\nwhich is according to godliness:","Unto the hope of life everlasting, which God, who lieth not, hath\npromised before the times of the world:","But hath in due times manifested his word in preaching, which is\ncommitted to me according to the commandment of God our Saviour:","To Titus, my beloved son according to the common faith, grace and\npeace, from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Saviour.","For this cause I left thee in Crete:  that thou shouldest set in\norder the things that are wanting and shouldest ordain priests in every\ncity, as I also appointed thee:","If any be without crime, the husband of one wife.  having faithful\nchildren, not accused of riot or unruly.","For a bishop must be without crime, as the steward of God:  not\nproud, not subject to anger, nor given to wine, no striker, not greedy\nof filthy lucre:","But given to hospitality, gentle, sober, just, holy, continent:","Embracing that faithful word which is according to doctrine, that\nhe may be able to exhort in sound doctrine and to convince the\ngainsayers.","For there are also many disobedient, vain talkers and seducers:\nespecially they who are of the circumcision.","Who must be reproved, who subvert whole houses, teaching things\nwhich they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.","One of them a prophet of their own, said:  The Cretans are always\nliars, evil beasts, slothful bellies.","This testimony is true.  Wherefore, rebuke them sharply, that they\nmay be sound in the faith:","Not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn\nthemselves away from the truth.","All things are clean to the clean:  but to them that are defiled\nand to unbelievers, nothing is clean:  but both their mind and their\nconscience are defiled.","They profess that they know God:  but in their works they deny\nhim:  being abominable and incredulous and to every good work reprobate."]}
