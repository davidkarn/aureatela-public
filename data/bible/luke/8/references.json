Out of modesty I at first refused compliance, but as she persisted in her demand and frequently urged me to consent to it, I at last did so and taught her what I had learned not from myself-for self-confidence is the worst of teachers-but from the church's most famous writers. Wherever I stuck fast and honestly confessed myself at fault she would by no means rest content but would force me by fresh questions to point out to her which of many different solutions seemed to me the most probable. I will mention here another fact which to those who are envious may well seem incredible. While I myself beginning as a young man have with much toil and effort partially acquired the Hebrew tongue and study it now unceasingly lest if I leave it, it also may leave me; Paula, on making up her mind that she too would learn it, succeeded so well that she could chant the psalms in Hebrew and could speak the language without a trace of the pronunciation peculiar to Latin. The same accomplishment can be seen to this day in her daughter Eustochium, who always kept close to her mother's side, obeyed all her commands, never slept apart from her, never walked abroad or took a meal without her never had a penny that she could call her own, rejoiced when her mother gave to the poor her little patrimony, and fully believed that in filial affection she had the best heritage and the truest riches. I must not pass over in silence the joy which Paula felt when she heard her little granddaughter and namesake, the child of Laeta and Toxotius-who was born and I may even say conceived in answer to a vow of her parents dedicating her to virginity-when, I say, she heard the little one in her cradle sing \"alleluia\" and falter out the words \"grandmother\" and \"aunt.\" One wish alone made her long to see her native land again; that she might know her son and his wife and child[fn-41-P4149_1120189:2996-nf] to have renounced the world and to be serving Christ. And it has been granted to her in part. For while her granddaughter is destined to take the veil, her daughter-in-law has vowed herself to perpetual chastity, and by faith and alms emulates the example that her mother has set her. She strives to exhibit at Rome the virtues which Paula set forth in all their fulness at Jerusalem.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":8,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1153","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"You tell me farther that Vigilantius execrates vigils.

At this time a certain catechumen joined him, being desirous of becoming instructed in the doctrines[fn-2-P205_35948:17-nf] and habits of the most holy man. But, after the lapse only of a few days, the catechumen, seized with a languor, began to suffer from a violent fever. It so happened that Martin had then left home, and having remained away three days, he found on his return that life had departed from the catechumen; and so suddenly had death occurred, that he had left this world without receiving baptism. The body being laid out in public was being honored by the last sad offices on the part of the mourning brethren, when Martin hurries up to them with tears and lamentations. But then laying hold; as it were, of the Holy Spirit, with the whole powers of his mind, he orders the others to quit the cell in which the body was lying; and bolting the door, he stretches himself at full length on the dead limbs of the departed brother. Having given himself for some time to earnest prayer, and perceiving by means of the Spirit of God that power was present,[fn-2-P206_36966:18-nf] he then rose up for a little, and gazing on the countenance of the deceased, he waited without misgiving for the result of his prayer and of the mercy of the Lord. And scarcely had the space of two hours elapsed, when he saw the dead man begin to move a little in all his members, and to tremble with his eyes opened for the practice of sight. Then indeed, turning to the Lord with a loud voice and giving thanks, he filled the cell with his ejaculations. Hearing the noise, those who had been standing at the door immediately rush inside. And truly a marvelous spectacle met them, for they beheld the man alive whom they had formerly left dead. Thus being restored to life, and having immediately obtained baptism, he lived for many years afterwards; and he was the first who offered himself to us both as a subject that had experienced the virtues[fn-2-P207_37840:19-nf] of Martin, and as a witness to their existence. The same man was wont to relate that, when he left the body, he was brought before the tribunal of the Judge, and being assigned to gloomy regions and vulgar crowds, he received a severe 4 sentence. Then, however, he added, it was suggested by two angels of the Judge that he was the man for whom Martin was praying ; and that, on this account, he was ordered to be led back by the same angels, and given up to Martin, and restored to his former life. From this time forward, the name of the sainted man became illustrious, so that, as being reckoned holy by all, he was also deemed powerful and truly apostolical.","title":"On the Life of St. Martin.","author":"Sulpitius Severus"},{"chapter":8,"verse":45,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"60","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"And again in the Epistle to the Colossians, to them that have not the knowledge of the Only Begotten, there is mention of him that holdeth \"the head,\" that is, Christ, \"from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered increaseth with the increase of God.\"[fn-12-P1205_285115:48-nf] And that Christ is the head of the Church we have learned in another passage, when the apostle says \"gave him to be the head over all things to the Church,\"[fn-12-P1206_285294:49-nf] and \"of his fulness have all we received.\"[fn-12-P1207_285355:50-nf] And the Lord Himself says \"He shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.\"[fn-12-P1208_285451:51-nf] In a word, the diligent reader will perceive that \"of whom\" is used in diverse manners.[fn-12-P1209_285556:52-nf] For instance, the Lord says, \"I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.\"[fn-12-P1210_285647:53-nf] Similarly we have frequently observed \"of whom\" used of the Spirit. \"He that soweth to the spirit,\" it is said, \"shall of the spirit reap life ever!asting.\"[fn-12-P1211_285859:54-nf] John too writes, \"Hereby we know that he abideth in ns by(e0k) the spirit which he hath given us.\"[fn-12-P1212_286189:55-nf] \"That which is conceived in her,\" says the angel, \"is of the Holy Ghost,\"[fn-12-P1213_286280:56-nf] and the Lord says \"that which is born of the spirit is spirit.\"[fn-12-P1214_286365:57-nf] Such then is the case so far.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":8,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_17_vi_on_monogamy_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"41","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Turning now to the law, which is properly ours-that is, to the Gospel-by what kind of examples are we met, until we come to definite dogmas?

But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness. And why? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by works[fn-16-P1678_758465:269-nf] -in other words, working it out as it were by themselves, not believing that it is God who works within them. \"For it is God which worketh in us both to will and to do of His own good pleasure.\"[fn-16-P1679_758684:270-nf] And hereby \"they stumbled at the stumbling-stone.\"[fn-16-P1680_758756:271-nf] For what he said, \"not by faith, but as it were by works,\"[fn-16-P1681_758835:272-nf] he most clearly explained in the following words: \"They, being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.

In this place, however, it is certainly not circumcision which they wanted to establish as their own righteousness, because God established this by prescribing it Himself.

For whenever He raised anyone from the dead He[fn-67-P6786_2143957:175-nf] ordered that food should be given him to eat, lest the resurrection should be thought a delusion. And this is why Lazarus after his resurrection is[fn-67-P6787_2144263:176-nf] described as being at the feast with our Lord. We do not deny that fish and other kinds of flesh, if we choose, may be taken as food; but as we prefer virginity to marriage, so do we esteem fasting and spirituality above meats and full-bloodedness. And if Peter[fn-67-P6788_2144548:177-nf] before dinner went to the supper chamber at the sixth hour, a chance fit of hunger does not prejudice fasting. For, if this were so, because our Lord[fn-67-P6789_2144748:178-nf] at the sixth hour sat weary on the well of Samaria and wished to drink, all must of necessity, whether they so desire or not, drink at that time. Possibly it was the Sabbath, or the Lord's day, and he hungered at the sixth hour after two or three days' fasting; for I could never believe that the Apostle, if he had eaten a dinner only one day previous and had been blown out with a great meal, would have been hungry by noon next day. But if he did dine the day previous, and was hungry next day before luncheon, I do not think that a man who was so soon hungry ate until he was satisfied. Again, God by the mouth of Isaiah says what fast He did not choose:[fn-67-P6790_2145430:179-nf] \"In the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and afflict the lowly: ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness. it is not such a fast that I have chosen, saith the Lord.\" What kind He has chosen He thus teaches: \"Deal thy bread to the hungry, and bring the houseless poor into thy house. When thou seest the naked cover him, and hide not thyself from thine own flesh.\" He did not therefore reject fasting, but showed what He would have it to be: for that bodily hunger is not pleasing to God which is made null and void by strife, and plunder, and lust. If God does not desire fasting, how is it that in[fn-67-P6791_2146086:180-nf] Leviticus He commands the whole people in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, to fast until the evening, and threatens that he who does not afflict his soul shall die and be cut off from his people? How is it that the[fn-67-P6792_2146334:181-nf] graves of lust where the people fell in their devotion to flesh remain even to this day in the wilderness? Do we not read that the stupid people gorged themselves with quails until the wrath of God came upon them? Why was the man of God at whose prophecy the hand of King Jeroboam withered, and who ate contrary to the command of God,[fn-67-P6793_2146738:182-nf] immediately smitten? Strange that the lion which left the ass safe and sound should not spare the prophet just risen from his meal!He who, while he was fasting, had wrought miracles, no sooner ate a meal than he paid the penalty for the gratification. Joel also cries aloud:[fn-67-P6794_2147038:183-nf] \"Sanctify a fast, proclaim a time of healing,\" that it might appear that a fast is sanctified by other works, and that a holy fast avails for the cure of sin. Moreover, just as true virginity is not prejudiced by the counterfeit professions of the virgins of the devil, so neither is true fasting by the periodic fast and perpetual abstinence from certain kinds of food on the part of the worshippers of Isis and Cybele, particularly when a fast from bread is made up for by feasting on flesh. And just as the signs of Moses were imitated by the signs of the Egyptians which were in reality no signs at all, for the rod of Moses swallowed up the rods of the magicians: so when the devil tries to be the rival of God this does not prove that our religion is superstitious, but that we are negligent, since we refuse to do what even men of the world see clearly to be good.","title":"Book II.","author":false},{"chapter":8,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_20_commandment_tenth","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"ANF-02","text":"\"Remove from you,\" says he, \"grief; for she is the sister of doubt and anger.\" \"How, sir,\" say I, \"is she the sister of these? for anger, doubt, and grief seem to be quite different from each other.\" \"You are senseless, O man.

Thus ought every servant of God to feel and act, even one in an inferior place, that he may come to have a more important one, if he has made some upward step by his endurance of persecution. But when persons in authority themselves-I mean the very deacons, and presbyters, and bishops-take to flight, how will a layman be able to see with what view it was said, Flee from city to city? Thus, too, with the leaders turning their backs, who of the common rank will hope to persuade men to stand firm in the battle? Most assuredly a good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep, according to the word of Moses, when the Lord Christ had not as yet been revealed, but was already shadowed forth in himself: \"If you destroy this people,\" he says, \"destroy me also along with it.\"[fn-19-P1985_600348:43-nf] But Christ, confirming these foreshadowings Himself, adds: \"The bad shepherd is he who, on seeing the wolf, flees, and leaves the sheep to be torn in pieces.\"[fn-19-P1986_600527:44-nf] Why, a shepherd like this will be tuned off from the farm; the wages to have been given him at the time of his discharge will be kept from him as compensation; nay, even from his former savings a restoration of the master's loss will be required; for \"to him who hath shall be given, but from him who hath not shall be taken away even that which he seemeth to have.[fn-19-P1987_600910:45-nf] Thus Zechariah threatens: \"Arise, O sword, against the shepherds, and pluck ye out the sheep; and I will turn my hand against the shepherds.\"[fn-19-P1988_601072:46-nf] And against them both Ezekiel and Jeremiah declaim with kindred threatenings, for their not only wickedly eating of the Sheep,-they feeding themselves rather than those committed to their charge,-but also scattering the flock, and giving it over, shepherdless, a prey to all the beasts of the field. And this never happens more than when in persecution the Church is abandoned by the clergy. If any one recognises the Spirit also, he will hear him branding the runaways. But if it does not become the keepers of the flock to flee when the wolves invade it-nay, if that is absolutely unlawful (for He who has declared a shepherd of this sort a bad one has certainly condemned him; and whatever is condemned has, without doubt, become unlawful)-on this ground it will not be the duty of those who have been set over the Church to flee in the time of persecution. But otherwise, if the flock should flee, the overseer of the flock would have no call to hold his ground, as his doing so in that case would be, without good reason, to give to the flock protection, which it would not require in consequence of its liberty, forsooth, to flee.","title":"IX.

But most foolishly did our Pontic heresiarch act in this too. As if it would not be more readily believed that flesh in the Divine Being should rather be unborn than untrue, this belief having in fact had the way mainly prepared for it by the Creator's angels when they conversed in flesh which was real, although unborn. For indeed the notorious Philumena[fn-49-P4943_1562274:145-nf] persuaded Apelles and the other seceders from Marcion rather to believe that Christ did really carry about a body of flesh; not derived to Him, however, from birth, but one which He borrowed from the elements. Now, as Marcion was apprehensive that a belief of the fleshly body would also involve a belief of birth, undoubtedly He who seemed to be man was believed to be verily and indeed born. For a certain woman had exclaimed, \"Blessed is the womb that bare Thee, and the paps which Thou hast sucked!\"[fn-49-P4944_1563133:146-nf] And how else could they have said that His mother and His brethren were standing without?[fn-49-P4945_1563243:147-nf] But we shall see more of this in the proper place.[fn-49-P4946_1563316:148-nf] Surely, when He also proclaimed Himself as the Son of man, He, without doubt, confessed that He had been born. Now I would rather refer all these points to an examination of the gospel; but still, as I have already stated, if he, who seemed to be man, had by all means to pass as having been born, it was vain for him to suppose that faith in his nativity was to be perfected[fn-49-P4947_1563750:149-nf] by the device of an imaginary flesh. For what advantage was there in that being not true which was held to be true, whether it were his flesh or his birth? Or if you should say, let human opinion go for nothing;[fn-49-P4948_1564039:150-nf] you are then honouring your god under the shelter of a deception, since he knew himself to be something different from what he had made men to think of him. In that case you might possibly have assigned to him a putative nativity even, and so not have hung the question on this point. For silly women fancy themselves pregnant sometimes, when they are corpulent[fn-49-P4949_1564431:151-nf] either from their natural flux[fn-49-P4950_1564479:152-nf] or from some other malady. And, no doubt, it had become his duty, since he had put on the mere mask of his substance, to act out from its earliest scene the play of his phantasy, lest he should have failed in his part at the beginning of the flesh. You have, of course,[fn-49-P4951_1564775:153-nf] rejected the sham of a nativity, and have produced true flesh itself. And, no doubt, even the real nativity of a God is a most mean thing.[fn-49-P4952_1564945:154-nf] Come then, wind up your cavils[fn-49-P4953_1564996:155-nf] against the most sacred and reverend works of nature; inveigh against all that you are; destroy the origin of flesh and life; call the womb a sewer of the illustrious animal-in other words, the manufactory for the production of man; dilate on the impure and shameful tortures of parturition, and then on the filthy, troublesome, contemptible issues of the puerperal labour itself! But yet, after you have pulled all these things down to infamy, that you may affirm them to be unworthy of God, birth will not be worse for Him than death, infancy than the cross, punishment than nature, condemnation than the flesh. If Christ truly suffered all this, to be born was a less thing for Him. If Christ suffered evasively,[fn-49-P4954_1565727:156-nf] as a phantom; evasively, too, might He have been born. Such are Marcion's chief arguments by which he makes out another Christ; and I think that we show plainly enough that they are utterly irrelevant, when we teach how much more truly consistent with God is the reality rather than the falsehood of that condition[fn-49-P4955_1566059:157-nf] in which He manifested His Christ. Since He was \"the truth,\" He was flesh; since He was flesh, He was born. For the points which this heresy assaults are confirmed, when the means of the assault are destroyed. Therefore if He is to be considered in the flesh,[fn-49-P4956_1566335:158-nf] because He was born; and born, because He is in the flesh, and because He is no phantom,-it follows that He must be acknowledged as Himself the very Christ of the Creator, who was by the Creator's prophets foretold as about to come in the flesh, and by the process of human birth.[fn-49-P4957_1566632:159-nf] ","title":"Book III.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":8,"verse":32,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_25_homily_xix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"82","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"With this view He hath again mentioned heaven also, and their Father; to abash the hearer by this topic likewise; that he of all people, being of such a Father, should be made a wild beast of; and summoned as he is to heaven, should cherish an earthly and ordinary[fn-20-P2071_685859:49-nf] sort of mind.

By Isaiah the Lord called these wealthy ladies-\"Rise up, ye women that are at ease, and hear my voice\"[fn-59-P5994_1803340:702-nf] -that He might prove[fn-59-P5995_1803604:703-nf] them first as disciples, and then as assistants and helpers: \"Daughters, hear my words in hope; this day of the year cherish the memory of, in labour with hope.\" For it was \"in labour\" that they followed Him, and \"with hope\" did they minister to Him. On the subject of parables, let it suffice that it has been once for all shown that this kind of language[fn-59-P5996_1803980:704-nf] was with equal distinctness promised by the Creator. But there is that direct mode of His speaking[fn-59-P5997_1804095:705-nf] to the people\"Ye shall hear with the ear, but ye shall not understand\"[fn-59-P5998_1804187:706-nf] -which now claims notice as having furnished to Christ that frequent form of His earnest instruction: \"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.\"[fn-59-P5999_1804352:707-nf] Not as if Christ, actuated with a diverse spirit, permitted a hearing which the Creator had refused; but because the exhortation followed the threatening. First came, \"Ye shall hear with the ear, but shall not understand; \"then followed, \"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.\" For they wilfully refused to hear, although they had ears. He, however, was teaching them that it was the ears of the heart which were necessary; and with these the Creator had said that they would not hear. Therefore it is that He adds by His Christ, \"Take heed how ye hear,\"[fn-60-P6000_1804931:708-nf] and hear not,-meaning, of course, with the hearing of the heart, not of the ear. If you only attach a proper, sense to the Creator's admonition[fn-60-P6001_1805097:709-nf] suitable to the meaning of Him who was rousing the people to hear by the words, \"Take heed how ye hear,\" it amounted to a menace to such as would not hear. In fact,[fn-60-P6002_1805285:710-nf] that most merciful god of yours, who judges not, neither is angry, is minatory. This is proved even by the sentence which immediately follows: \"Whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.\"[fn-60-P6003_1805589:711-nf] What shall be given? The increase of faith, or understanding, or even salvation. What shall be taken away? That, of course, which shall be, given. By whom shall the gift and the deprivation be made? If by the Creator it be taken away, by Him also shall it be given. If by Marcion's god it be given, by Marcion's god also will it be taken away. Now, for whatever reason He threatens the \"deprivation,\" it will not be the work of a god who knows not how to threaten, because incapable of anger. I am, moreover, astonished when he says that \"a candle is not usually hidden,\"[fn-60-P6004_1806183:712-nf] who had hidden himself-a greater and more needful light-during so long a time; and when he promises that \"everything shall be brought out of its secrecy and made manifest,\"[fn-60-P6005_1806378:713-nf] who hitherto has kept his god in obscurity, waiting (I suppose) until Marcion be born. We now come to the most strenuously-plied argument of all those who call in question the Lord's nativity. They say that He testifies Himself to His not having been born, when He asks, \"Who is my mother, and who are my brethren? \"[fn-60-P6006_1806717:714-nf] In this manner heretics either wrest plain and simple words to any sense they choose by their conjectures, or else they violently resolve by a literal interpretation words which imply a conditional sense and are incapable of a simple solution,[fn-60-P6007_1806983:715-nf] as in this passage. We, for our part, say in reply, first, that it could not possibly have been told Him that His mother and His brethren stood without, desiring to see Him, if He had had no mother and no brethren. They must have been known to him who announced them, either some time previously, or then at that very time, when they desired to see Him, or sent Him their message. To this our first position this answer is usually given by the other side. But suppose they sent Him the message for the purpose of tempting Him? Well, but the Scripture does not say so; and inasmuch as it is usual for it to indicate what is done in the way of temptation (\"Behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted Him; \"[fn-60-P6008_1807770:716-nf] again, when inquiring about tribute, the Pharisees came to Him, tempting Him[fn-60-P6009_1807866:717-nf] ), so, when it makes no mention of temptation, it does not admit the interpretation of temptation. However, although I do not allow this sense, I may as well ask, by way of a superfluous refutation, for the reasons of the alleged temptation, To what purpose could they have tempted Him by naming His mother and His brethren? If it was to ascertain whether He had been born or not-when was a question raised on this point, which they must resolve by tempting Him in this way? Who could doubt His having been born, when they[fn-60-P6010_1808409:718-nf] saw Him before them a veritable man?-whom they had heard call Himself \"Son of man? \"-of whom they doubted whether He were God or Son of God, from seeing Him, as they did, in the perfect garb of human quality?-supposing Him rather to be a prophet, a great one indeed,[fn-60-P6011_1808752:719-nf] but still one who had been born as man? Even if it had been necessary that He should thus be tried in the investigation of His birth, surely any other proof would have better answered the trial than that to be obtained from mentioning those relatives which it was quite possible for Him, in spite of His true nativity, not at that moment to have had. For tell me now, does a mother live on contemporaneously[fn-60-P6012_1809220:720-nf] with her sons in every case? Have all sons brothers born for them?[fn-60-P6013_1809303:721-nf] May a man rather not have fathers and sisters (living), or even no relatives at all? But there is historical proof[fn-60-P6014_1809440:722-nf] that at this very time[fn-60-P6015_1809516:723-nf] a census had been taken in Judµa by Sentius Saturninus,[fn-60-P6016_1809640:724-nf] which might have satisfied their inquiry respecting the family and descent of Christ. Such a method of testing the point had therefore no consistency whatever in it and they \"who were standing without\" were really \"His mother and His brethren.\" It remains for us to examine His meaning when He resorts to non-literal[fn-60-P6017_1811442:725-nf] words, saying \"Who is my mother or my brethren? \"It seems as if His language amounted to a denial of His family and His birth; but it arose actually from the absolute nature of the case, and the conditional sense in which His words were to be explained.[fn-60-P6018_1811791:726-nf] He was justly indignant, that persons so very near to Him\" stood without,\" while strangers were within hanging on His words, especially as they wanted to call Him away from the solemn work He had in hand. He did not so much deny as disavow[fn-60-P6019_1812120:727-nf] them. And therefore, when to the previous question, \"Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?[fn-60-P6020_1812353:728-nf] He added the answer \"None but they who hear my words and do them,\" He transferred the names of blood-relationship to others, whom He judged to be more closely related to Him by reason of their faith. Now no one transfers a thing except from him who possesses that which is transferred. If, therefore, He made them \"His mother and His brethren\" who were not so, how could He deny them these relationships who really had them?

If it was to ascertain whether He had been born or not-when was a question raised on this point, which they must resolve by tempting Him in this way? Who could doubt His having been born, when they[fn-60-P6010_1808409:718-nf] saw Him before them a veritable man?-whom they had heard call Himself \"Son of man? \"-of whom they doubted whether He were God or Son of God, from seeing Him, as they did, in the perfect garb of human quality?-supposing Him rather to be a prophet, a great one indeed,[fn-60-P6011_1808752:719-nf] but still one who had been born as man? Even if it had been necessary that He should thus be tried in the investigation of His birth, surely any other proof would have better answered the trial than that to be obtained from mentioning those relatives which it was quite possible for Him, in spite of His true nativity, not at that moment to have had. For tell me now, does a mother live on contemporaneously[fn-60-P6012_1809220:720-nf] with her sons in every case? Have all sons brothers born for them?[fn-60-P6013_1809303:721-nf] May a man rather not have fathers and sisters (living), or even no relatives at all? But there is historical proof[fn-60-P6014_1809440:722-nf] that at this very time[fn-60-P6015_1809516:723-nf] a census had been taken in Judµa by Sentius Saturninus,[fn-60-P6016_1809640:724-nf] which might have satisfied their inquiry respecting the family and descent of Christ. Such a method of testing the point had therefore no consistency whatever in it and they \"who were standing without\" were really \"His mother and His brethren.\" It remains for us to examine His meaning when He resorts to non-literal[fn-60-P6017_1811442:725-nf] words, saying \"Who is my mother or my brethren? \"It seems as if His language amounted to a denial of His family and His birth; but it arose actually from the absolute nature of the case, and the conditional sense in which His words were to be explained.[fn-60-P6018_1811791:726-nf] He was justly indignant, that persons so very near to Him\" stood without,\" while strangers were within hanging on His words, especially as they wanted to call Him away from the solemn work He had in hand. He did not so much deny as disavow[fn-60-P6019_1812120:727-nf] them. And therefore, when to the previous question, \"Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?[fn-60-P6020_1812353:728-nf] He added the answer \"None but they who hear my words and do them,\" He transferred the names of blood-relationship to others, whom He judged to be more closely related to Him by reason of their faith. Now no one transfers a thing except from him who possesses that which is transferred. If, therefore, He made them \"His mother and His brethren\" who were not so, how could He deny them these relationships who really had them? Surely only on the condition of their deserts, and not by any disavowal of His near relatives; teaching them by His own actual example,[fn-60-P6021_1812984:729-nf] that \"whosoever preferred father or mother or brethren to the Word of God, was not a disciple worthy of Him.\"[fn-60-P6022_1813115:730-nf] Besides,[fn-60-P6023_1813144:731-nf] His admission of His mother and His brethren was the more express, from the fact of His unwillingness to acknowledge them. That He adopted others only confirmed those in their relationship to Him whom He refused because of their offence, and for whom He substituted the others, not as being truer relatives, but worthier ones. Finally, it was no great matter if He did prefer to kindred (that) faith which it[fn-60-P6024_1813569:732-nf] did not possess.[fn-60-P6025_1813643:733-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":8,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"87","folder":"ANF-03","text":"The fact that certain rich women clave to Christ, \"which ministered unto Him of their substance,\" amongst whom was the wife of the king's steward, is a subject of prophecy. By Isaiah the Lord called these wealthy ladies-\"Rise up, ye women that are at ease, and hear my voice\"[fn-59-P5994_1803340:702-nf] -that He might prove[fn-59-P5995_1803604:703-nf] them first as disciples, and then as assistants and helpers: \"Daughters, hear my words in hope; this day of the year cherish the memory of, in labour with hope.\" For it was \"in labour\" that they followed Him, and \"with hope\" did they minister to Him. On the subject of parables, let it suffice that it has been once for all shown that this kind of language[fn-59-P5996_1803980:704-nf] was with equal distinctness promised by the Creator. But there is that direct mode of His speaking[fn-59-P5997_1804095:705-nf] to the people\"Ye shall hear with the ear, but ye shall not understand\"[fn-59-P5998_1804187:706-nf] -which now claims notice as having furnished to Christ that frequent form of His earnest instruction: \"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.\"[fn-59-P5999_1804352:707-nf] Not as if Christ, actuated with a diverse spirit, permitted a hearing which the Creator had refused; but because the exhortation followed the threatening. First came, \"Ye shall hear with the ear, but shall not understand; \"then followed, \"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.\" For they wilfully refused to hear, although they had ears. He, however, was teaching them that it was the ears of the heart which were necessary; and with these the Creator had said that they would not hear. Therefore it is that He adds by His Christ, \"Take heed how ye hear,\"[fn-60-P6000_1804931:708-nf] and hear not,-meaning, of course, with the hearing of the heart, not of the ear. If you only attach a proper, sense to the Creator's admonition[fn-60-P6001_1805097:709-nf] suitable to the meaning of Him who was rousing the people to hear by the words, \"Take heed how ye hear,\" it amounted to a menace to such as would not hear. In fact,[fn-60-P6002_1805285:710-nf] that most merciful god of yours, who judges not, neither is angry, is minatory. This is proved even by the sentence which immediately follows: \"Whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.\"[fn-60-P6003_1805589:711-nf] What shall be given? The increase of faith, or understanding, or even salvation. What shall be taken away? That, of course, which shall be, given. By whom shall the gift and the deprivation be made? If by the Creator it be taken away, by Him also shall it be given. If by Marcion's god it be given, by Marcion's god also will it be taken away. Now, for whatever reason He threatens the \"deprivation,\" it will not be the work of a god who knows not how to threaten, because incapable of anger. I am, moreover, astonished when he says that \"a candle is not usually hidden,\"[fn-60-P6004_1806183:712-nf] who had hidden himself-a greater and more needful light-during so long a time; and when he promises that \"everything shall be brought out of its secrecy and made manifest,\"[fn-60-P6005_1806378:713-nf] who hitherto has kept his god in obscurity, waiting (I suppose) until Marcion be born. We now come to the most strenuously-plied argument of all those who call in question the Lord's nativity. They say that He testifies Himself to His not having been born, when He asks, \"Who is my mother, and who are my brethren? \"[fn-60-P6006_1806717:714-nf] In this manner heretics either wrest plain and simple words to any sense they choose by their conjectures, or else they violently resolve by a literal interpretation words which imply a conditional sense and are incapable of a simple solution,[fn-60-P6007_1806983:715-nf] as in this passage. We, for our part, say in reply, first, that it could not possibly have been told Him that His mother and His brethren stood without, desiring to see Him, if He had had no mother and no brethren. They must have been known to him who announced them, either some time previously, or then at that very time, when they desired to see Him, or sent Him their message. To this our first position this answer is usually given by the other side. But suppose they sent Him the message for the purpose of tempting Him? Well, but the Scripture does not say so; and inasmuch as it is usual for it to indicate what is done in the way of temptation (\"Behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted Him; \"[fn-60-P6008_1807770:716-nf] again, when inquiring about tribute, the Pharisees came to Him, tempting Him[fn-60-P6009_1807866:717-nf] ), so, when it makes no mention of temptation, it does not admit the interpretation of temptation.

Nothing of the kind. But the elements own[fn-60-P6030_1814772:735-nf] their own Maker, just as they had been accustomed to obey His servants also. Examine well the Exodus, Marcion; look at the rod of Moses, as it waves His command to the Red Sea, ampler than all the lakes of Judµa. How the sea yawns from its very depths, then fixes itself in two solidified masses, and so, out of the interval between them,[fn-60-P6031_1815128:736-nf] makes a way for the people to pass dry-shod across; again does the same rod vibrate, the sea returns in its strength, and in the concourse of its waters the chivalry of Egypt is engulphed! To that consummation the very winds subserved! Read, too, how that the Jordan was as a sword, to hinder the emigrant nation in their passage across its stream; how that its waters from above stood still, and its current below wholly ceased to run at the bidding of Joshua,[fn-60-P6032_1815641:737-nf] when his priests began to pass over![fn-60-P6033_1815702:738-nf] What will you say to this?

But I should have been content with the examples I have adduced without addition,[fn-60-P6034_1816768:739-nf] if a prediction of His present passage on the sea had not preceded Christ's coming. As psalm is, in fact, accomplished by this[fn-60-P6035_1816909:740-nf] crossing over the lake. \"The Lord,\" says the psalmist, \"is upon many waters.\"[fn-60-P6036_1817001:741-nf] When He disperses its waves, Habakkuk's words are fulfilled, where he says, \"Scattering the waters in His passage.\"[fn-60-P6037_1817137:742-nf] When at His rebuke the sea is calmed, Nahum is also verified: He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry,\"[fn-60-P6038_1817290:743-nf] including the winds indeed, whereby it was disquieted. With what evidence would you have my Christ vindicated? Shall it come from the examples, or from the prophecies, of the Creator? You suppose that He is predicted as a military and armed warrior,[fn-60-P6039_1817558:744-nf] instead of one who in a figurative and allegorical sense was to wage a spiritual warfare against spiritual enemies, in spiritual campaigns, and with spiritual weapons: come now, when in one man alone you discover a multitude of demons calling itself Legion,[fn-60-P6040_1817856:745-nf] of course comprised of spirits, you should learn that Christ also must be understood to be an exterminator of spiritual foes, who wields spiritual arms and fights in spiritual strife; and that it was none other than He,[fn-60-P6041_1818098:746-nf] who now had to contend with even a legion of demons. Therefore it is of such a war as this that the Psalm may evidently have spoken: \"The Lord is strong, The Lord is mighty in battle.\"[fn-60-P6042_1818312:747-nf] For with the last enemy death did He fight, and through the trophy of the cross He triumphed. Now of what God did the Legion testify that Jesus was the Son?[fn-60-P6043_1818489:748-nf] No doubt, of that God whose torments and abyss they knew and dreaded. It seems impossible for them to have remained up to this time in ignorance of what the power of the recent and unknown god was working in the world, because it is very unlikely that the Creator was ignorant thereof. For if He had been at any time ignorant that there was another god above Himself, He had by this time at all events discovered that there was one at work[fn-60-P6044_1818951:749-nf] below His heaven. Now, what their Lord had discovered had by this time become notorious to His entire family within the same world and the same circuit of heaven, in which the strange deity dwelt and acted.[fn-60-P6045_1819174:750-nf] As therefore both the Creator and His creatures[fn-60-P6046_1819244:751-nf] must have had knowledge of him, if he had been in existence, so, inasmuch as he had no existence, the demons really knew none other than the Christ of their own God. They do not ask of the strange god, what they recollected they must beg of the Creator-not to be plunged into the Creator's abyss. They at last had their request granted. On what ground? Because they had lied? Because they had proclaimed Him to be the Son of a ruthless God? And what sort of god will that be who helped the lying, and upheld his detractors? However, no need of this thought, for,[fn-60-P6047_1819851:752-nf] inasmuch as they had not lied, inasmuch as they had acknowledged that the God of the abyss was also their God, so did He actually Himself affirm that He was the same whom these demons acknowledged-Jesus, the Judge and Son of the avenging God. Now, behold an inkling[fn-60-P6048_1820160:753-nf] of the Creator's failings[fn-60-P6049_1820202:754-nf] and infirmities in Christ; for I on my side[fn-60-P6050_1820269:755-nf] mean to impute to Him ignorance. Allow me some indulgence in my effort against the heretic. Jesus is touched by the woman who had an issue of blood,[fn-60-P6051_1820430:756-nf] He knew not by whom. \"Who touched me? \"He asks, when His disciples alleged an excuse. He even persists in His assertion of ignorance: \"Somebody hath touched me,\" He says, and advances some proof: \"For I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.\" What says our heretic? Could Christ have known the person? And why did He speak as if He were ignorant? Why? Surely it was to challenge her faith, and to try her fear. Precisely as He had once questioned Adam, as if in ignorance: Adam, where art thou? \"[fn-60-P6052_1820952:757-nf] Thus you have both the Creator excused in the same way as Christ, and Christ acting similarly to[fn-60-P6053_1821088:758-nf] the Creator. But in this case He acted as an adversary of the law; and therefore, as the law forbids contact with a woman with an issue,[fn-60-P6054_1821257:759-nf] He desired not only that this woman should touch Him, but that He should heal her.[fn-60-P6055_1821360:760-nf] Here, then, is a God who is not merciful by nature, but in hostility! Yet, if we find that such was the merit of this woman's faith, that He said unto her, Thy faith hath saved thee.\"[fn-60-P6056_1821577:761-nf] what are you, that you should detect an hostility to the law in that act, which the Lord Himself shows us to have been done as a reward of faith? But will you have it that this faith of the woman consisted in the contempt which she had acquired for the law? Who can suppose, that a woman who had been. hitherto unconscious of any God, uninitiated as yet in any new law, should violently infringe that law by which she was up to this time bound? On what faith, indeed, was such an infringement hazarded? In what God believing? Whom despising? The Creator? Her touch at least was an act of faith. And if of faith in the Creator, how could she have violated His law,[fn-60-P6057_1822263:762-nf] when she was ignorant of any other God? Whatever her infringement of the law amounted to, it proceeded from and was proportionate to her faith in the Creator. But how can these two things be compatible? That she violated the law, and violated it in faith, which ought to have restrained her from such violation? I will tell you how her faith was this above all:[fn-60-P6058_1822662:763-nf] it made her believe that her God preferred mercy even to sacrifice; she was certain that her God was working in Christ; she touched Him, therefore, nor as a holy man simply, nor as a prophet, whom she knew to be capable of contamination by reason of his human nature, but as very God, whom she assumed to be beyond all possibility of pollution by any uncleanness.[fn-60-P6059_1823040:764-nf] She therefore, not without reason,[fn-60-P6060_1823093:765-nf] interpreted for herself the law, as meaning that such things as are susceptible of defilement become defiled, but not so God, whom she knew for certain to be in Christ. But she recollected this also, that what came under the prohibition of the law[fn-60-P6061_1823360:766-nf] was that ordinary and usual issue of blood which proceeds from natural functions every month, and in childbirth, not that which was the result of disordered health. Her case, however, was one of long abounding[fn-60-P6062_1823593:767-nf] ill health, for which she knew that the succour of God's mercy was needed, and not the natural relief of time. And thus she may: evidently be regarded as having discerned[fn-60-P6063_1823794:768-nf] the law, instead of breaking it. This will prove to be the faith which was to confer intelligence likewise. \"If ye will not believe,\" says (the prophet), \"ye shall not understand.\"[fn-60-P6064_1823995:769-nf] When Christ approved of the faith of this woman, which simply rested in the Creator, He declared by His answer to her,[fn-60-P6065_1824134:770-nf] that He was Himself the divine object of the faith of which He approved. Nor can I overlook the fact that His garment, by being touched, demonstrated also the truth of His body; for of course\"[fn-60-P6066_1824349:771-nf] it was a body, and not a phantom, which the garment clothed.[fn-60-P6067_1824425:772-nf] This indeed is not our point now; but the remark has a natural bearing on the question we are discussing. For if it were not a veritable body, but only a fantastic one, it could not for certain have received contamination, as being an unsubstantial thing.[fn-60-P6068_1824749:773-nf] He therefore, who, by reason of this vacuity of his substance, was incapable of contamination, how could he possibly have desired this touch?[fn-60-P6069_1824913:774-nf] As an adversary of the law, his conduct was deceitful, for he was not susceptible of a real pollution.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":8,"verse":28,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"89","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But \"what manner of man is this? for He commandeth even the winds and water!\"[fn-60-P6029_1814577:734-nf] Of course He is the new master and proprietor of the elements, now that the Creator is deposed, and excluded from their possession!

They do not ask of the strange god, what they recollected they must beg of the Creator-not to be plunged into the Creator's abyss. They at last had their request granted. On what ground? Because they had lied? Because they had proclaimed Him to be the Son of a ruthless God? And what sort of god will that be who helped the lying, and upheld his detractors?

I will tell you how her faith was this above all:[fn-60-P6058_1822662:763-nf] it made her believe that her God preferred mercy even to sacrifice; she was certain that her God was working in Christ; she touched Him, therefore, nor as a holy man simply, nor as a prophet, whom she knew to be capable of contamination by reason of his human nature, but as very God, whom she assumed to be beyond all possibility of pollution by any uncleanness.[fn-60-P6059_1823040:764-nf] She therefore, not without reason,[fn-60-P6060_1823093:765-nf] interpreted for herself the law, as meaning that such things as are susceptible of defilement become defiled, but not so God, whom she knew for certain to be in Christ. But she recollected this also, that what came under the prohibition of the law[fn-60-P6061_1823360:766-nf] was that ordinary and usual issue of blood which proceeds from natural functions every month, and in childbirth, not that which was the result of disordered health. Her case, however, was one of long abounding[fn-60-P6062_1823593:767-nf] ill health, for which she knew that the succour of God's mercy was needed, and not the natural relief of time. And thus she may: evidently be regarded as having discerned[fn-60-P6063_1823794:768-nf] the law, instead of breaking it.

For if it were not a veritable body, but only a fantastic one, it could not for certain have received contamination, as being an unsubstantial thing.[fn-60-P6068_1824749:773-nf] He therefore, who, by reason of this vacuity of his substance, was incapable of contamination, how could he possibly have desired this touch?[fn-60-P6069_1824913:774-nf] As an adversary of the law, his conduct was deceitful, for he was not susceptible of a real pollution.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":8,"verse":48,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"89","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But \"what manner of man is this? for He commandeth even the winds and water!\"[fn-60-P6029_1814577:734-nf] Of course He is the new master and proprietor of the elements, now that the Creator is deposed, and excluded from their possession! Nothing of the kind. But the elements own[fn-60-P6030_1814772:735-nf] their own Maker, just as they had been accustomed to obey His servants also. Examine well the Exodus, Marcion; look at the rod of Moses, as it waves His command to the Red Sea, ampler than all the lakes of Judµa. How the sea yawns from its very depths, then fixes itself in two solidified masses, and so, out of the interval between them,[fn-60-P6031_1815128:736-nf] makes a way for the people to pass dry-shod across; again does the same rod vibrate, the sea returns in its strength, and in the concourse of its waters the chivalry of Egypt is engulphed! To that consummation the very winds subserved! Read, too, how that the Jordan was as a sword, to hinder the emigrant nation in their passage across its stream; how that its waters from above stood still, and its current below wholly ceased to run at the bidding of Joshua,[fn-60-P6032_1815641:737-nf] when his priests began to pass over![fn-60-P6033_1815702:738-nf] What will you say to this? If it be your Christ that is meant above, he will not be more potent than the servants of the Creator. But I should have been content with the examples I have adduced without addition,[fn-60-P6034_1816768:739-nf] if a prediction of His present passage on the sea had not preceded Christ's coming. As psalm is, in fact, accomplished by this[fn-60-P6035_1816909:740-nf] crossing over the lake. \"The Lord,\" says the psalmist, \"is upon many waters.\"[fn-60-P6036_1817001:741-nf] When He disperses its waves, Habakkuk's words are fulfilled, where he says, \"Scattering the waters in His passage.\"[fn-60-P6037_1817137:742-nf] When at His rebuke the sea is calmed, Nahum is also verified: He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry,\"[fn-60-P6038_1817290:743-nf] including the winds indeed, whereby it was disquieted. With what evidence would you have my Christ vindicated? Shall it come from the examples, or from the prophecies, of the Creator? You suppose that He is predicted as a military and armed warrior,[fn-60-P6039_1817558:744-nf] instead of one who in a figurative and allegorical sense was to wage a spiritual warfare against spiritual enemies, in spiritual campaigns, and with spiritual weapons: come now, when in one man alone you discover a multitude of demons calling itself Legion,[fn-60-P6040_1817856:745-nf] of course comprised of spirits, you should learn that Christ also must be understood to be an exterminator of spiritual foes, who wields spiritual arms and fights in spiritual strife; and that it was none other than He,[fn-60-P6041_1818098:746-nf] who now had to contend with even a legion of demons. Therefore it is of such a war as this that the Psalm may evidently have spoken: \"The Lord is strong, The Lord is mighty in battle.\"[fn-60-P6042_1818312:747-nf] For with the last enemy death did He fight, and through the trophy of the cross He triumphed. Now of what God did the Legion testify that Jesus was the Son?[fn-60-P6043_1818489:748-nf] No doubt, of that God whose torments and abyss they knew and dreaded. It seems impossible for them to have remained up to this time in ignorance of what the power of the recent and unknown god was working in the world, because it is very unlikely that the Creator was ignorant thereof. For if He had been at any time ignorant that there was another god above Himself, He had by this time at all events discovered that there was one at work[fn-60-P6044_1818951:749-nf] below His heaven. Now, what their Lord had discovered had by this time become notorious to His entire family within the same world and the same circuit of heaven, in which the strange deity dwelt and acted.[fn-60-P6045_1819174:750-nf] As therefore both the Creator and His creatures[fn-60-P6046_1819244:751-nf] must have had knowledge of him, if he had been in existence, so, inasmuch as he had no existence, the demons really knew none other than the Christ of their own God. They do not ask of the strange god, what they recollected they must beg of the Creator-not to be plunged into the Creator's abyss. They at last had their request granted. On what ground? Because they had lied? Because they had proclaimed Him to be the Son of a ruthless God? And what sort of god will that be who helped the lying, and upheld his detractors? However, no need of this thought, for,[fn-60-P6047_1819851:752-nf] inasmuch as they had not lied, inasmuch as they had acknowledged that the God of the abyss was also their God, so did He actually Himself affirm that He was the same whom these demons acknowledged-Jesus, the Judge and Son of the avenging God. Now, behold an inkling[fn-60-P6048_1820160:753-nf] of the Creator's failings[fn-60-P6049_1820202:754-nf] and infirmities in Christ; for I on my side[fn-60-P6050_1820269:755-nf] mean to impute to Him ignorance. Allow me some indulgence in my effort against the heretic. Jesus is touched by the woman who had an issue of blood,[fn-60-P6051_1820430:756-nf] He knew not by whom. \"Who touched me? \"He asks, when His disciples alleged an excuse. He even persists in His assertion of ignorance: \"Somebody hath touched me,\" He says, and advances some proof: \"For I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.\" What says our heretic? Could Christ have known the person? And why did He speak as if He were ignorant? Why? Surely it was to challenge her faith, and to try her fear. Precisely as He had once questioned Adam, as if in ignorance: Adam, where art thou? \"[fn-60-P6052_1820952:757-nf] Thus you have both the Creator excused in the same way as Christ, and Christ acting similarly to[fn-60-P6053_1821088:758-nf] the Creator. But in this case He acted as an adversary of the law; and therefore, as the law forbids contact with a woman with an issue,[fn-60-P6054_1821257:759-nf] He desired not only that this woman should touch Him, but that He should heal her.[fn-60-P6055_1821360:760-nf] Here, then, is a God who is not merciful by nature, but in hostility! Yet, if we find that such was the merit of this woman's faith, that He said unto her, Thy faith hath saved thee.\"[fn-60-P6056_1821577:761-nf] what are you, that you should detect an hostility to the law in that act, which the Lord Himself shows us to have been done as a reward of faith? But will you have it that this faith of the woman consisted in the contempt which she had acquired for the law? Who can suppose, that a woman who had been. hitherto unconscious of any God, uninitiated as yet in any new law, should violently infringe that law by which she was up to this time bound? On what faith, indeed, was such an infringement hazarded? In what God believing? Whom despising? The Creator? Her touch at least was an act of faith. And if of faith in the Creator, how could she have violated His law,[fn-60-P6057_1822263:762-nf] when she was ignorant of any other God? Whatever her infringement of the law amounted to, it proceeded from and was proportionate to her faith in the Creator. But how can these two things be compatible? That she violated the law, and violated it in faith, which ought to have restrained her from such violation? I will tell you how her faith was this above all:[fn-60-P6058_1822662:763-nf] it made her believe that her God preferred mercy even to sacrifice; she was certain that her God was working in Christ; she touched Him, therefore, nor as a holy man simply, nor as a prophet, whom she knew to be capable of contamination by reason of his human nature, but as very God, whom she assumed to be beyond all possibility of pollution by any uncleanness.[fn-60-P6059_1823040:764-nf] She therefore, not without reason,[fn-60-P6060_1823093:765-nf] interpreted for herself the law, as meaning that such things as are susceptible of defilement become defiled, but not so God, whom she knew for certain to be in Christ. But she recollected this also, that what came under the prohibition of the law[fn-60-P6061_1823360:766-nf] was that ordinary and usual issue of blood which proceeds from natural functions every month, and in childbirth, not that which was the result of disordered health. Her case, however, was one of long abounding[fn-60-P6062_1823593:767-nf] ill health, for which she knew that the succour of God's mercy was needed, and not the natural relief of time. And thus she may: evidently be regarded as having discerned[fn-60-P6063_1823794:768-nf] the law, instead of breaking it. This will prove to be the faith which was to confer intelligence likewise. \"If ye will not believe,\" says (the prophet), \"ye shall not understand.\"[fn-60-P6064_1823995:769-nf] When Christ approved of the faith of this woman, which simply rested in the Creator, He declared by His answer to her,[fn-60-P6065_1824134:770-nf] that He was Himself the divine object of the faith of which He approved. Nor can I overlook the fact that His garment, by being touched, demonstrated also the truth of His body; for of course\"[fn-60-P6066_1824349:771-nf] it was a body, and not a phantom, which the garment clothed.[fn-60-P6067_1824425:772-nf] This indeed is not our point now; but the remark has a natural bearing on the question we are discussing.

Now, he who had advanced such a conjecture as this should first show that another god had been proclaimed by Christ. For nobody would have wanted to know how to pray, before he had learned whom he was to pray to. If, however, he had already learned this, prove it. If you find nowhere any proof, let me tell you[fn-63-P6362_1885186:1048-nf] that it was to the Creator that he asked for instruction in prayer, to whom John's disciples also used to pray. But, inasmuch as John had introduced some new order of prayer, this disciple had not improperly presumed to think that he ought also to ask of Christ whether they too must not (according to some special rule of their Master) pray, not indeed to another god, but in another manner. Christ accordingly[fn-63-P6363_1885615:1049-nf] would not have taught His disciple prayer before He had given him the knowledge of God Himself. Therefore what He actually taught was prayer to Him whom the disciple had already known. In short, you may discover in the import[fn-63-P6364_1885859:1050-nf] of the prayer what God is addressed therein. To whom can I say, \"Father? \"[fn-63-P6365_1885951:1051-nf] To him who had nothing to do with making me, from whom I do not derive my origin? Or to Him, who, by making and fashioning me, became my parent?[fn-63-P6366_1886117:1052-nf] Of whom can I ask for His Holy Spirit? Of him who gives not even the mundane spirit;[fn-63-P6367_1886222:1053-nf] or of Him \"who maketh His angels spirits,\" and whose Spirit it was which in the beginning hovered upon the waters.[fn-63-P6368_1886396:1054-nf] Whose kingdom shall I wish to come-his, of whom I never heard as the king of glory; or His, in whose hand are even the hearts of kings? Who shall give me my daily[fn-63-P6369_1886579:1055-nf] bread? Shall it be he who produces for me not a grain of millet-seed;[fn-63-P6370_1886670:1056-nf] or He who even from heaven gave to His people day by day the bread of angels?[fn-63-P6371_1886765:1057-nf] Who shall forgive me my trespasses?[fn-63-P6372_1886826:1058-nf] He who, by refusing to judge them, does not retain them; or He who, unless He forgives them, will retain them, even to His judgment? Who shall suffer us not to be led into temptation? He before whom the tempter will never be able to tremble; or He who from the beginning has beforehand condemned[fn-63-P6373_1887143:1059-nf] the angel tempter? If any one, with such a form,[fn-63-P6374_1887215:1060-nf] invokes another god and not the Creator, he does not pray; he only blasphemes.[fn-63-P6375_1887315:1061-nf] In like manner, from whom must I ask that I may receive? Of whom seek, that I may find? To whom knock, that it may be opened to me?[fn-63-P6376_1887465:1062-nf] Who has to give to him that asks, but He to whom all things belong, and whose am I also that am the asker? What, however, have I lost before that other god, that I should seek of him and find it. If it be wisdom and prudence, it is the Creator who has hidden them. Shall I resort to him, then, in quest of them? If it be health[fn-63-P6377_1887814:1063-nf] and life, they are at the disposal of the Creator. Nor must anything be sought and found anywhere else than there, where it is kept in secret that it may come to light. So, again, at no other door will I knock than at that out of which my privilege has reached me.[fn-63-P6378_1888117:1064-nf] In fine, if to receive, and to find, and to be admitted, is the fruit of labour and earnestness to him who has asked, and sought, and knocked, understand that these duties have been enjoined, and results promised, by the Creator. As for that most excellent god of yours, coming as he professes gratuitously to help man, who was not his (creature),[fn-63-P6379_1888594:1065-nf] he could not have imposed upon him any labour, or (endowed him with) any earnestness. For he would by this time cease to be the most excellent god, were he not spontaneously to give to every one who does not ask, and permit every one who seeks not to find, and open to every one who does not knock. The Creator, on the contrary,[fn-63-P6380_1888963:1066-nf] was able to proclaim these duties and rewards by Christ, in order that man, who by sinning had offended his God, might toil on (in his probation), and by his perseverance in asking might receive, and in seeking might find, and in knocking might enter. Accordingly, the preceding similitude[fn-63-P6381_1889269:1067-nf] represents the man who went at night and begged for the loaves, in the light of a friend and not a stranger, and makes him knock at a friend's house and not at a stranger's. But even if he has offended, man is more of a friend with the Creator than with the god of Marcion. At His door, therefore, does he knock to whom he had the right of access; whose gate he had found; whom he knew to possess bread; in bed now with His children, whom He had willed to be born.[fn-63-P6382_1889761:1068-nf] Even though the knocking is late in the day, it is yet the Creator's time. To Him belongs the latest hour who owns an entire age[fn-63-P6383_1890055:1069-nf] and the end thereof. As for the new god, however, no one could have knocked at his door late, for he has hardly yet[fn-63-P6384_1890190:1070-nf] seen the light of morning. It is the Creator, who once shut the door to the Gentiles, which was then knocked at by the Jews, that both rises and gives, if not now to man as a friend, yet not as a stranger, but, as He says, \"because of his importunity.\"[fn-63-P6385_1890484:1071-nf] Importunate, however, the recent god could not have permitted any one to be in the short time (since his appearance).[fn-63-P6386_1890623:1072-nf] Him, therefore, whom you call the Creator recognise also as \"Father.\" It is even He who knows what His children require. For when they asked for bread, He gave them manna from heaven; and when they wanted flesh, He sent them abundance of quails-not a serpent for a fish, nor for an egg a scorpion.[fn-63-P6387_1890940:1073-nf] It will, however, appertain to Him not to give evil instead of good, who has both one and the other in His power. Marcion's god, on the contrary, not having a scorpion, was unable to refuse to give what he did not possess; only He (could do so), who, having a scorpion, yet gives it not. In like manner, it is He who will give the Holy Spirit, at whose command[fn-63-P6388_1891326:1074-nf] is also the unholy spirit. When He cast out the \"demon which was dumb\"[fn-63-P6389_1891417:1075-nf] (and by a cure of this sort verified Isaiah),[fn-63-P6390_1891485:1076-nf] and having been charged with casting out demons by Beelzebub, He said, \"If I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? \"[fn-63-P6391_1891654:1077-nf] By such a question what does He otherwise mean, than that He ejects the spirits by the same power by which their sons also did-that is, by the power of the Creator? For if you suppose the meaning to be, \"If I by Beelzebub, etc., by whom your sons? \"-as if He would reproach them with having the power of Beelzebub,-you are met at once by the preceding sentence, that \"Satan cannot be divided against himself.\"[fn-63-P6392_1892086:1078-nf] So that it was not by Beelzebub that even they were casting out demons, but (as we have said) by the power of the Creator; and that He might make this understood, He adds: \"But if I with the finger of God cast out demons, is not the kingdom of God come near unto you? \"[fn-63-P6393_1892378:1079-nf] For the magicians who stood before Pharaoh and resisted Moses called the power of the Creator\"the finger of God.\"[fn-63-P6394_1892514:1080-nf] It was the finger of God, because it was a sign[fn-63-P6395_1892585:1081-nf] that even a thing of weakness was yet abundant in strength. This Christ also showed, when, recalling to notice (and not obliterating) those ancient wonders which were really His own,[fn-63-P6396_1892791:1082-nf] He said that the power of God must be understood to be the finger of none other God than Him, under[fn-63-P6397_1892928:1083-nf] whom it had received this appellation. His kingdom, therefore, was come near to them, whose power was called His \"finger.\" Well, therefore, did He connect[fn-63-P6398_1893098:1084-nf] with the parable of \"the strong man armed,\" whom \"a stronger man still overcame,\"[fn-63-P6399_1893200:1085-nf] the prince of the demons, whom He had already called Beelzebub and Satan; signifying that it was he who was overcome by the finger of God, and not that the Creator had been subdued by another god. Besides,[fn-64-P6400_1893431:1086-nf] how could His kingdom be still standing, with its boundaries, and laws, and functions, whom, even if the whole world were left entire to Him, Marcion's god could possibly seem to have overcome as \"the stronger than He,\" if it were not in consequence of His law that even Marcionites were constantly dying, by returning in their dissolution[fn-64-P6401_1893789:1087-nf] to the ground, and were so often admonished by even a scorpion, that the Creator had by no means been overcome?[fn-64-P6402_1893921:1088-nf] \"A (certain) mother of the company exclaims, `Blessed is the womb that bare Thee, and the paps which Thou hast sucked; 'but the Lord said, `Yea, rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.'\"[fn-64-P6403_1894392:1089-nf] Now He had in precisely similar terms rejected His mother or His brethren, whilst preferring those who heard and obeyed God.[fn-64-P6404_1894542:1090-nf] His mother, however, was not here present with Him. On that former occasion, therefore, He had not denied that He was her son by birth.[fn-64-P6405_1894716:1091-nf] On hearing this (salutation) the second time, He the second time transferred, as He had done before,[fn-64-P6406_1894834:1092-nf] the \"blessedness\" to His disciples from the womb and the paps of His mother, from whom, however, unless He had in her (a real mother) He could not have transferred it.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":8,"verse":18,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":39,"source_paragraph":"124","folder":"ANF-03","text":"\"Salvation comes to the house\" of Zacchµus even.[fn-68-P6826_1989404:1479-nf] For what reason? Was it because he also believed that Christ came by Marcion? But the blind man's cry was still sounding in the ears of all: \"Jesus, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.\" And \"all the people gave praise unto God\"-not Marcion's, but David's. Now, although Zacchµus was probably a Gentile,[fn-68-P6827_1989730:1480-nf] he yet from his intercourse with Jews had obtained a smattering[fn-68-P6828_1990137:1481-nf] of their Scriptures, and, more than this, had, without knowing it, fulfilled the precepts of Isaiah: \"Deal thy bread,\" said the prophet, \"to the hungry, and bring the poor that are cast out into thine house.\"[fn-68-P6829_1990380:1482-nf] This he did in the best possible way, by receiving the Lord, and entertaining Him in his house. \"When thou seest the naked cover him.\"[fn-68-P6830_1990539:1483-nf] This he promised to do, in an equally satisfactory way, when he offered the half of his goods for all works of mercy.[fn-68-P6831_1990687:1484-nf] So also \"he loosened the bands of wickedness. undid the heavy burdens, let the oppressed go free, and broke every yoke,\"[fn-68-P6832_1990867:1485-nf] when he said, \"If I have taken anything from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.\"[fn-68-P6833_1990990:1486-nf] Therefore the Lord said, \"This day is salvation come to this house.\"[fn-68-P6834_1991081:1487-nf] Thus did He give His testimony, that the precepts of the Creator spoken by the prophet tended to salvation.[fn-68-P6835_1991211:1488-nf] But when He adds, \"For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost,\"[fn-68-P6836_1991324:1489-nf] my present contention is not whether He was come to save what was lost, to whom it had once belonged, and from whom what He came to save had fallen away; but I approach a different question. Man, there can be no doubt of it, is here the subject of consideration. Now, since he consists of two parts,[fn-68-P6837_1991647:1490-nf] body and soul, the point to be inquired into is, in which of these two man would seem to have been lost? If in his body, then it is his body, not his soul, which is lost. What, however, is lost, the Son of man saves. The body,[fn-68-P6838_1991896:1491-nf] therefore, has the salvation. If, (on the other hand, ) it is in his soul that man is lost, salvation is designed for the lost soul; and the body which is not lost is safe.

Now, although Zacchµus was probably a Gentile,[fn-68-P6827_1989730:1480-nf] he yet from his intercourse with Jews had obtained a smattering[fn-68-P6828_1990137:1481-nf] of their Scriptures, and, more than this, had, without knowing it, fulfilled the precepts of Isaiah: \"Deal thy bread,\" said the prophet, \"to the hungry, and bring the poor that are cast out into thine house.\"[fn-68-P6829_1990380:1482-nf] This he did in the best possible way, by receiving the Lord, and entertaining Him in his house. \"When thou seest the naked cover him.\"[fn-68-P6830_1990539:1483-nf] This he promised to do, in an equally satisfactory way, when he offered the half of his goods for all works of mercy.[fn-68-P6831_1990687:1484-nf] So also \"he loosened the bands of wickedness. undid the heavy burdens, let the oppressed go free, and broke every yoke,\"[fn-68-P6832_1990867:1485-nf] when he said, \"If I have taken anything from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.\"[fn-68-P6833_1990990:1486-nf] Therefore the Lord said, \"This day is salvation come to this house.\"[fn-68-P6834_1991081:1487-nf] Thus did He give His testimony, that the precepts of the Creator spoken by the prophet tended to salvation.[fn-68-P6835_1991211:1488-nf] But when He adds, \"For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost,\"[fn-68-P6836_1991324:1489-nf] my present contention is not whether He was come to save what was lost, to whom it had once belonged, and from whom what He came to save had fallen away; but I approach a different question.

Still keeping by the order of time, Matthew next continues to the following effect: \"While He spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped Him, saying, My daughter is even now dead; but come and lay Thy hand upon her, and she shall live;\" and so on, until we come to the words, \"and the maid arose. And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.\"[fn-17-P1748_714071:284-nf] The other two, namely, Mark and Luke, in like manner give this same account, only they do not keep by the same order now. For they bring up this narrative in a different place, and insert it in another connection; to wit, at the point where He crosses the take and returns from the country of the Gerasenes, after casting out the devils and permitting them to go into the swine. Thus Mark introduces it, after he has related what took place among the Gerasenes, in the following manner: \"And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto Him: and He was nigh unto the sea. And there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw Him, he fell at His feet,\" etc.[fn-17-P1749_714827:285-nf] By this, then, we are certainly to understand that the occurrence in connection with the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue did take place after Jesus had passed across the lake again in the ship.[fn-17-P1750_715050:286-nf] It does not, however, appear from the words themselves how long after that passage this thing happened. But that some time did elapse is clear. For had there not been an interval, no period would be left within which those circumstances might fall which Matthew has just related in the matter of the feast in his house. These, indeed, he has told after the fashion of the evangelists, as if they were the story of another person's doings. But they are the story really of what took place in his own case, and at his own house. And after that narrative, what follows in the immediate context is nothing else than this notice of the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue. For he has constructed the whole recital in such a manner, that the mode of transition from one thing to the other has itself indicated with sufficient clearness that the words immediately, following give the narrative of what actually took place in immediate consecution. For after mentioning, in connection with the former incident, those words which Jesus spake with respect to the new cloth and the new wine, he has subjoined these other words, without any interruption in the narrative, namely, \"While He spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler.\" And this shows that, if the person approached Him while He was speaking these things, nothing else either done or said by Him could have intervened. In Mark's account, on the other hand, the place is quite apparent, as we have already pointed out, where other things [left unrecorded by him] might very well have come in. The case is much the same also with Luke, who, when he proceeds to follow up his version of the story of the miracle wrought among the Gerasenes, by giving his account of the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue, does not pass on to that in any such way as to place it in antagonism with Matthew's version, who, by his words, \"While He yet spake these things,\" gives us plainly to understand that the occurrence took place after those parables about the cloth and the wine. For when he has concluded his statement of what happened among the Gerasenes, Luke passes to the next subject in the following manner; \"And it came to pass that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received Him; for they were all waiting for Him. And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue, and he fell down at Jesus' feet,\" and so on.[fn-17-P1751_717695:287-nf] Thus we are given to understand that the crowd did indeed receive Jesus forthwith on the said occasion: for He was the person for whose return they, were waiting. But what is conveyed in the words which are directly added, \"And, behold, there came a man whose name was Jairus,\" is not to be taken to have occurred literally in immediate succession. On the contrary, the feast with the publicans, as Matthew records it, took place before that. For Matthew connects this present incident with that feast in such a way as to make it impossible for us to suppose that any other sequence of events can be the correct order.[fn-17-P1752_718339:288-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":8,"verse":50,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":30,"source_paragraph":"180","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"66. At the same time, however, there remains the fact that Matthew represents the ruler of the synagogue to have spoken to the Lord of his daughter, not merely as one likely to die, or as dying, or as on the very point of expiring, but as even then dead; while these other two evangelists report her as now nigh unto death, but not yet really dead, and keep so strictly to that version of the circumstances, that they tell us how the persons came at a later stage with the intelligence of her actual death, and with the message that for this reason the Master ought not now to trouble Himself by coming, with the purpose of laying His hand upon her, and so preventing her from dying,-the matter not being put as if He was one possessed of ability to raise the once dead to life. It becomes necessary for us, therefore, to investigate this fact lest it may seem to exhibit any contradiction between the accounts. And the way to explain it is to suppose that, by reason of brevity in the narrative, Matthew has preferred to express it as if the Lord had been really asked to do what it is clear He did actually do, namely, raise the dead to life. For what Matthew directs our attention to, is not the mere words spoken by the father about his daughter, but what is of more importance, his mind and purpose. Thus he has given words calculated to represent the father's real thoughts. For he had so thoroughly despaired of his child's case, that not believing that she whom he had just left dying, could possibly now be found yet in life, his thought rather was that she might be made alive again. Accordingly two of the evangelists have introduced the words which were literally spoken by Jairus. But Matthew has exhibited rather what the man secretly wished and thought. Thus both petitions were really addressed to the Lord; namely, either that He should restore the dying damsel, or that, if she was already dead, He might raise her to life again. But as it was Matthew's object to tell the whole story in short compass, he has represented the father as directly expressing in his request what, it is certain, had been his own real wish, and what Christ actually did. It is true, indeed, that if those two evangelists, or one of them, had told us that the father himself spake the words which the parties who came from his house uttered,-namely, that Jesus should not now trouble Himself, because the damsel had died,-then the words which Matthew has put into his mouth would not be in harmony with his thoughts. But, as the case really stands, it is not said that he gave his consent to the parties who brought that report, and who bade the Master no more think of coming now. And together with this, we have to observe, that when the Lord addressed him in these terms, \"Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole,\"[fn-17-P1756_722173:290-nf] He did not find fault with him on the ground of his want of belief, but really encouraged him to a yet stronger faith.

(There, Paul says,) \"And none of the Apostles saw I; but here, it is said (Barnabas), brought him to the Apostles.\"-Well, then, either (Paul) means, \"I went not up with intent to refer or attach myself to them (anaqesqai)-for what saith he? \"I referred not myself, neither went I to Jerusalem to those who were Apostles before me:\"[fn-9-P913_814818:1-nf] or else, that the laying await for him in Damascus was after his return from Arabia;[fn-9-P914_815959:2-nf] or else, again, that the visit to Jerusalem was after he came from Arabia. Certainly of his own accord he went not to the Apostles, but \"assayed to join himself unto the disciples \"-as being[fn-9-P915_816327:3-nf] a teacher, not a disciple-\" I went not,\" he says, \"for this purpose, that I should go to those who were Apostles before me: certainly, I learnt nothing from them.\" Or,[fn-9-P916_816709:4-nf] he does not speak of this visit, but passes it by, so that the order is, \"I went into Arabia, then I came to Damascus, then to Jerusalem, then to Syria:\" or else, again, that he went up to Jerusalem, then was sent to Damascus, then to Arabia, then again to Damascus, then to Caesarea. Also, the visit \"after fourteen years,\" probably, was when he brought up the [alms to the] brethren together with Barnabas: (Gal. ii. 1) or else he means a different occasion. (Acts xi. 30.) For the Historian for conciseness, often omits incidents, and condenses the times. Observe how unambitious the writer is, and how he does not even relate (related in ch. xxii. 17-21) that vision, but passes it by. \"He assayed,\" it says, \"to join himself to the disciples. And they were afraid of him.\" By this again is shown the ardor of Paul's character: not (only) from the mouth of Ananias, and of those who wondered at him there, but also of those in Jerusalem: \"they believed not that he was a disciple:\" for truly that was beyond all human expectation.[fn-9-P917_818923:5-nf] He[fn-9-P918_820001:6-nf] was no longer a wild beast, but a man mild and gentle! And observe how he does not go to the Apostles, such is his forbearance, but to the disciples, as being a disciple. He was not thought worthy of credit. \"But Barnabas\"-\" Son of Consolation\" is his appellation, whence also he makes himself easy of access to the man: for\"he was a kind man\" (ch. xi. 24), exceedingly, and this is proved both by the present instance, and in the affair of John (Mark)-\" having taken him, brought him to the Apostles, and related to them how he had seen the Lord in the way.\"[fn-9-P919_822073:7-nf] (xv. 39.) It is likely that at Damascus also he had heard all about him: whence he was not afraid but the others were, for he was a man whose glance inspired fear. \"How,\" it says, \"he had seen the Lord in the way, and that He had spoken unto him, and how in Damascus he had spoken boldly in the name of the Lord. And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem, and speaking boldly in the name of Jesus\" (v. 28): these things were demonstrative of the former, and by his acts he made good what was spoken of him. \"And he spake, and disputed with the Hellenists.\" (v. 29.) So then the disciples were afraid of him, and the Apostles did not trust him; by this therefore he relieves them of their fear. \"With the Hellenists:\" he means those who used the Greek tongue: and this he did, very wisely; for those others, those profound Hebrews had no mind even to see him. \"But they,\" it says, \"went about to slay him:\" a token, this, of his energy, and triumphant victory, and of their exceeding annoyance at what had happened. Thereupon, fearing lest the issue should be the same as in the case of Stephen, they sent him to Caesarea. For it says, \"When the brethren were aware of this, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus\" (v. 30), at the same time to preach, and likely to be more in safety, as being in his own country. But observe, I pray you, how far it is from being the case that everything is done by (miraculous) grace; how, on the contrary, God does in many things leave them to manage for themselves by their own wisdom and in a human way; so[fn-9-P920_825183:8-nf] to cut off the excuse of idle people: for if it was so in the case of Paul, much more in theirs.[fn-9-P921_825394:9-nf] \"Then, it says, \"the Church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace (they), being edified, and walking in the fear of the Lord, and abounded in the comfort of the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-9-P922_826466:10-nf] (v. 31.) He is about to relate that Peter goes down (from Jerusalem), therefore that you may not impute this to fear, he first says this. For while there was persecution, he was in Jerusalem, but when the affairs of the Church are everywhere in security, then it is that he leaves Jerusalem. See how fervent and energetic he is! For he did not think, because there was peace, therefore there was no need of his presence. Paul[fn-9-P923_827143:11-nf] departed, and there was peace: there is no war nor disturbance. Them, they respected most, as having often stood by them, and as being held in admiration by the multitude: but him, they despised, and were more savage against him. See, how great a war, and immediately, peace! See what that war effected. It dispersed the peace-makers. In Samaria, Simon was put to shame: in Judea, the affair of Sapphira took place. Not that, because there was peace, therefore matters became relaxed, but such was the peace as also to need exhortation. \"And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.\" (v. 32.) Like the commander of an army, he went about, inspecting the ranks, what part was compact, what in good order, what needed his presence. See how on all occasions he goes about, foremost. When an Apostle was to be chosen, he was the foremost: when the Jews were to be told, that these were \"not drunken,\" when the lame man was to be healed, when harangues to be made, he is before the rest: when the rulers were to be spoken to, he was the man; when Ananias, he (ch. i. 15; ii. 15; iii. 4-12; iv. 8; v. 3-15.): when healings were wrought by the shadow, still it was he. And look: where there was danger, he was the man, and where good[fn-9-P924_829465:12-nf] management (was needed); but where all is calm, there they act all in common, and he demands no greater honor (than the others). When need was to work miracles, he starts forward, and here again he is the man to labor and toil. \"And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy. And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And. he arose immediately.\" (v. 33, 34.) And why did he not wait for the man's faith, and ask if he wished to be healed? In the first place, the miracle served for exhortation to many: hear then how great the gain. \"And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.\" (v. 35.) For the man was notable. \"Arise, and make thy bed:\" he does well to give a proof of the miracle: for they not only released men of their diseases, but in giving the health they gave the strength also. Moreover, at that time they had given no proofs of their power, so that the man could not reasonably have been required to show his faith, as neither in the case of the lame man did they demand it. (ch. iii. 6.) As therefore Christ in the beginning of His miracles did not demand faith, so neither did these. For in Jerusalem indeed, as was but reasonable, the faith of the parties was first shown; \"they brought out their sick into the streets, but as Peter passed by, his shadow at least might fall upon some of them\" (ch. v. 15); for many miracles had been wrought there; but here this is the first that occurs. For of the miracles, some were wrought for the purpose of drawing others (to faith); some for the comfort of them that believed. \"Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and alms-deeds which she did. And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber. And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that be would not delay to come to them.\" (v. 36-38). Why did they wait till she was dead? Why was not Peter solicited (eskulh) before this? So right-minded (filosofountej) were they, they did not think it proper to trouble (skullein) the Disciples about such matters, and to take them away from the preaching: as indeed this is why it mentions that the place was near, seeing[fn-9-P925_832299:13-nf] they asked this as a thing beside his mark, and not now in the regular course. \"Not to delay to come unto them:\" for she was a disciple. And Peter arose, and went with them. And when he was come, they led him into the upper chamber.\" (v. 39.) They do not beseech, but leave it to him to give her life (swthrian.) See[fn-9-P926_833202:14-nf] what a cheering inducement to alms is here! \"And all the widows,\" it says, \"stood round him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them.\" Peter went into the apartment, as one who took it calmly, but see what an accession came of it! It is not without a meaning that the Writer has informed us of the woman's name, but to show that the name she bore (ferwnumoj hn) matched her character; as active and wakeful was she as an antelope. For in many instances there is a Providence in the giving of names, as we have often told you. \"She was full,\" it says, \"of good works:\" not only of alms, but \"of good works,\" first, and then of this good work in particular. \"Which,\" it says, \"Dorcas made while she was with them.\" Great humility! Not as we do; but they were all together in common, and in company with them she made these things and worked. \"But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.\" (v. 40.) Why does he put them all out? That he may not be confused nor disturbed by their weeping. \"And having knelt down, he prayed.\" Observe the intentness of his prayer. \"And[fn-9-P927_835086:15-nf] he gave her his hand.\" (v. 41.) So did Christ to the daughter of Jairus: \"And (says the Evangelist) having taken her by the hand.\" Mark severally, first the life, then the strength brought into her, the one by the word, the other by his hand-\" And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive:\" to some for comfort, because they received back their sister, and because they saw the miracle, and for kindly support (prostasian) to others. \"And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord. And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.\" (v. 42-43.)

In the first place, that we set not widowed continence either as bearing no fruit, or set it but level with the desert of married charity, or equal it unto virgin glory; or think that the Crown of Martyrdom, either established in habit of mind, although proof of trial be wanting, or in actual making trial of suffering, be added unto either one of those these chastities, without any increase of fruitfulness. Next, when we set it down that many men and women so keep virginal chastity, as that yet they do not the things which the Lord saith, \"If thou wiliest to be perfect, go, sell all that thou hast, and give unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in Heaven: and come, follow me;\"[fn-40-P4087_1929095:169-nf] and dare not unite themselves to those dwelling together, among whom no one saith that any thing is his own, but all things are unto them common;[fn-40-P4088_1929263:170-nf] do we think that there is no addition of fruitfulness unto the virgins of God, when they do this? or that the virgins of God are without any fruit, although they do not this? Therefore there are many gifts, and some brighter and higher than others, each than each. And at times one is fruitful in fewer gifts, but better; another in lower gifts, but more. And in what manner they be either made equal one to another, or distinguished one from another, in receiving eternal honors, who of men would dare to pronounce? whereas yet it is plain both that those differences are many, and that the better are profitable not for the present time, but for eternity. But I judge that the Lord willed to make mention of three differences of fruitfulness, the rest He left to such as understand.[fn-40-P4089_1930076:171-nf] For also another Evangelist hath made mention only of the hundred-fold:[fn-40-P4090_1930171:172-nf] we are not, therefore, are we, to think that he either rejected, or knew not of, the other two, but rather that he left them to be understood?","title":"Of Holy Virginity.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":8,"verse":35,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_31_the_oration_of_the_emperor_constantine","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"41","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"The great majority, however, in their folly, ascribe the regulation of the universe to nature, while some imagine fate, or accident,[fn-81-P8163_3344864:25-nf] to be the cause.

Thus an irreligious Pagan might bring the same reproaches against Christ in the Gospel, as Faustus brings against God in the Old Testament. He might say that Christ lacked foresight, not only because He was astonished at the faith of the centurion, but because He chose Judas as a disciple who proved disobedient to His commands; as Faustus objects to the precept given in Paradise, which, as it turned out, was not obeyed. He might also cavil at Christ's not knowing who touched Him, when the woman suffering from an issue of blood touched the hem of His garment; as Faustus blames God for not knowing where Adam had hid himself. If this ignorance is implied in God's saying, \"Where art thou, Adam?\"[fn-20-P2054_1206281:22-nf] the same may be said of Christ's asking, \"Who touched me?\"[fn-20-P2055_1206358:23-nf] The Pagans also might call Christ timid and envious, in not wishing five of the ten virgins to gain eternal life by entering into His kingdom, and in shutting them out, so that they knocked in vain in their entreaty to have the door opened, as if forgetful of His own promise, \"Knock, and it shall be opened unto you;\"[fn-20-P2056_1206701:24-nf] as Faustus charges God with fear and envy in not admitting man after his sin to eternal life. Again, he might call Christ greedy of the blood, not of beasts, but of men, because he said, \"He that loseth his life for my sake, shall keep it unto life eternal;\"[fn-20-P2057_1206979:25-nf] as Faustus reproaches God in reference to those animal sacrifices which prefigured the sacrifice of blood-shedding by which we are redeemed. He might also accuse Christ of jealousy, because in narrating His driving the buyers and sellers out of the temple, the evangelist quotes as applicable to Him the words, \"The jealousy of Thine house hath eaten me up;\"[fn-20-P2058_1207356:26-nf] as Faustus accuses God of jealousy in forbidding sacrifices to be offered to other gods. He might say that Christ was angry with both His friends and His enemies: with His friends, because He said, \"The servant that knows his lord's will, and doeth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes;\" and with His enemies, because He said, \"If any one shall not receive you, shake off against him the dust of your shoes; verily I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for Sodom in the day of judgment than for that city;\"[fn-20-P2059_1207896:27-nf] as Faustus accuses God of being angry at one time with His friends, and at another with His enemies; both of whom are spoken of thus by the apostle: \"They that have sinned without law shall perish without law, and they that have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law.\"[fn-20-P2060_1208194:28-nf] Or he might say that Christ shed the blood of many without mercy, for a slight offense or for nothing. For to a Pagan there would appear to be little or no harm in not having a wedding garment at the marriage feast, for which our King in the Gospel commanded a man to be bound hand and foot, and cast into outer darkness;[fn-20-P2061_1208534:29-nf] or in not wishing to have Christ for a king, which is the sin of which Christ says, \"Those that would not have me to reign over them, bring hither and slay before me;\"[fn-20-P2062_1208727:30-nf] as Faustus blames God in the Old Testament for slaughtering thousands of human beings for slight offenses, as Faustus calls them, or for nothing. Again, if Faustus finds fault with God's threatening to come with the sword, and to spare neither the righteous nor the wicked, might not the Pagan. find as much fault with the words of the Apostle Paul, when he says of our God,\" He spared not His own Son, but gave Him up for us all;\"[fn-20-P2063_1209178:31-nf] or of Peter, when, in exhorting the saints to be patient in the midst of persecution and slaughter, he says, \"It is time that judgment begin from the house of God; and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that believe not the gospel of the Lord? And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and sinner appear?\"[fn-20-P2064_1209546:32-nf] What can be more righteous than the Only-Begotten, whom nevertheless the Father did not spare? And what can be plainer than that the righteous also are not spared, but chastised with manifold afflictions, as is clearly implied in the words, \"If the righteous scarcely are saved\"? As it is said in the Old Testament, \"Whom the Lord loveth He correcteth, and chastiseth every son whom He receiveth;\"[fn-20-P2065_1209968:33-nf] and, \"If we receive good at the hand of the Lord, shall we not also receive evil?\"[fn-20-P2066_1210071:34-nf] So we read also in the New Testament, \"Whom I love I rebuke and chasten;\"[fn-20-P2067_1210162:35-nf] and, \"If we judge ourselves, we shall not be judged of the Lord; but when we are judged, we are corrected of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.\"[fn-20-P2068_1210346:36-nf] If a Pagan were to make such objections to the New Testament, would not the Manichaeans try to answer them, though they themselves make similar objections to the Old Testament? But supposing them able to answer the Pagan, how absurd it would be to defend in the one Testament what they find fault with in the other! But if they could not answer the objections of the Pagan, why should they not allow in both Testaments, instead of in one only, that what appears wrong to unbelievers, from their ignorance, should be believed to be right by pious readers even when they also are ignorant?","title":"Book XXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":8,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_28_hymn_xiii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"18.

To Saul,[fn-61-P6191_959400:62-nf] when still a persecutor it is said, \"Saul Saul, why persecutest thou Me? \"and, \"I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.\" There are those who still have thorns with which they crown and dishonour Jesus, those, namely, who are choked by the cares, and riches, and pleasures of life, and though they have received the word of God, do not bring it to perfection.[fn-61-P6192_959773:63-nf] We must beware, therefore, lest we also, as crowning Jesus with thorns of our own, should be entered in the Gospel and read of in this character by those who learn the Jesus, who is in all and is present in all rational and holy lives, learn how He is anointed with ointment, is entertained, is glorified, or how, on the other side, He is dishonoured, and mocked, and beaten.

Moreover, a presumptuous confidence in baptism introduces all kind of vicious delay and tergiversation with regard to repentance; for, feeling sure of undoubted pardon of their sins, men meanwhile steal the intervening time, and make it for themselves into a holiday-time[fn-113-P11330_3212277:48-nf] for sinning, rather than a time for learning not to sin. Further, how inconsistent is it to expect pardon of sins (to be granted) to a repentance which they have not fulfilled! This is to hold out your hand for merchandise, but not produce the price. For repentance is the price at which the Lord has determined to award pardon: He proposes the redemption[fn-113-P11331_3212703:49-nf] of release from penalty at this compensating exchange of repentance. If, then, sellers first examine the coin with which they make their bargains, to see whether it be cut, or scraped, or adulterated,[fn-113-P11332_3212927:50-nf] we believe likewise that the Lord, when about to make us the grant of so costly merchandise, even of eternal life, first institutes a probation of our repentance. \"But meanwhile let us defer the reality of our repentance: it will then, I suppose, be clear that we are amended when we are absolved.\"[fn-113-P11333_3213259:51-nf] By no means; (but our amendment should be manifested) while, pardon being in abeyance, there is still a prospect of penalty; while the penitent does not yet merit-so far as merit we can-his liberation; while God is threatening, not while He is forgiving. For what slave, after his position has been changed by reception of freedom, charges himself with his (past) thefts and desertions? What soldier, after his discharge, makes satisfaction for his (former) brands? A sinner is bound to bemoan himself before receiving pardon, because the time of repentance is coincident with that of peril and of fear. Not that I deny that the divine benefit-the putting away of sins, I mean-is in every way sure to such as are on the point of entering the (baptismal) water; but what we have to labour for is, that it may be granted us to attain that blessing. For who will grant to you, a man of so faithless repentance, one single sprinkling of any water whatever? To approach it by stealth, indeed, and to get the minister appointed over this business misled by your asseverations, is easy; but God takes foresight for His own treasure, and suffers not the unworthy to steal a march upon it. What, in fact, does He say? \"Nothing hid which shall not be revealed.\"[fn-113-P11334_3214534:52-nf] Draw whatever (veil of) darkness you please over your deeds, \"God is light.\"[fn-113-P11335_3214631:53-nf] But some think as if God were under a necessity of bestowing even on the unworthy, what He has engaged (to give); and they turn His liberality into slavery. But if it is of necessity that God grants us the symbol of death,[fn-113-P11336_3214872:54-nf] then He does so unwilling. But who permits a gift to be permanently retained which he has granted unwillingly? For do not many afterward fall out of (grace)? is not this gift taken away from many? These, no doubt, are they who do steal a march upon (the treasure), who, after approaching to the faith of repentance, set up on the sands a house doomed to ruin. Let no one, then, flatter himself on the ground of being assigned to the \"recruit-classes\" of learners, as if on that account he have a licence even now to sin. As soon as you \"know the Lord,[fn-113-P11337_3215496:55-nf] you should fear Him; as soon as you have gazed on Him, you should reverence Him. But what difference does your \"knowing\" Him make, while you rest in the same practises as in days bygone, when you knew Him not? What, moreover, is it which distinguishes you from a perfected[fn-113-P11338_3215821:56-nf] servant of God? Is there one Christ for the baptized, another for the learners? Have they some different hope or reward? some different dread of judgment? some different necessity for repentance? That baptismal washing is a sealing of faith, which faith is begun and is commended by the faith of repentance. We are not washed in order that we may cease sinning, but because we have ceased, since in heart we have been bathed[fn-113-P11339_3216269:57-nf] already. For the first baptism of a learner is this, a perfect fear;[fn-113-P11340_3216382:58-nf] thenceforward, in so far as you have understanding of the Lord faith is sound, the conscience having once for all embraced repentance. Otherwise, if it is (only) after the baptismal waters that we cease sinning, it is of necessity, not of free-will, that we put on innocence. Who, then, is pro-eminent in goodness? he who is not allowed, or he whom it displeases, to be evil? he who is bidden, or he whose pleasure it is, to be free from crime? Let us, then, neither keep our hands from theft unless the hardness of bars withstand us, nor refrain our eyes from the concupiscence of fornication unless we be withdrawn by guardians of our persons, if no one who has surrendered himself to the Lord is to cease sinning unless he be bound thereto by baptism. But if any entertain this sentiment, I know not whether he, after baptism, do not feel more sadness to think that he has ceased from sinning, than gladness that he hath escaped from it. And so it is becoming that learners desire baptism, but do not hastily receive it: for he who desires it, honours it; he who hastily receives it, disdains it: in the one appears modesty, in the other arrogance; the former satisfies, the latter neglects it; the former covets to merit it, but the latter promises it to himself as a due return; the former takes, the latter usurps it. Whom would you judge worthier, except one who is more amended? whom more amended, except one who is more timid, and on that account has fulfilled the duty of true repentance? for he has feared to continue still in sin, lest he should not merit the reception of baptism. But the hasty receiver, inasmuch as he promised it himself (as his due), being forsooth secure (of obtaining it), could not fear: thus he fulfilled not repentance either, because he lacked the instrumental agent of repentance, that is, fear.[fn-113-P11341_3218238:59-nf] Hasty reception is the portion of irreverence; it inflates the seeker, it despises the Giver.

And now, the statements regarding Pharaoh have troubled many, respecting whom God declared several times, \"I will harden Pharaoh's heart.\"[fn-68-P6858_1451150:70-nf] For if he is hardened by God, and commits sin in consequence of being hardened, he is not the cause of sin to himself; and if so, then neither does Pharaoh possess free-will. And some one will say that, in a similar way, they who perish have not free-will, and will not perish of themselves. The declaration also in Ezekiel, \"I will take away their stony hearts, and will put in them hearts of flesh, that they may walk in My precepts, and keep My commandments,\"[fn-68-P6859_1451642:71-nf] might lead one to think that it was God who gave the power to walk in His commandments, and to keep His precepts, by His withdrawing the hindrance-the stony heart, and implanting a better-a heart of flesh. And let us look also at the passage in the Gospel-the answer which the Saviour returns to those who inquired why He spake to the multitude in parables. His words are: \"That seeing they might not see; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest they should be converted, and their sins be forgiven them.\"[fn-68-P6860_1452183:72-nf] The passage also in Paul: \"It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy.\"[fn-68-P6861_1452338:73-nf] The declarations, too, in other places, that \"both to will and to do are of God; \"[fn-68-P6862_1452439:74-nf] \"that God hath mercy upon whom He will have mercy, and whom He will He hardeneth.

But\nto those who obediently hear the exhortation of truth is given the gift of God itself-that is, to\nhear obediently; while to those who do not thus hear it is not given. For it was not some one only,\nbut Christ who said, \"No man cometh unto me, except it were given him of my Father;\"[fn-71-P7141_2727238:92-nf] and, \"To you it is given to know the mystery of\nthe kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.\"[fn-71-P7142_2727357:93-nf] And concerning continence He says, \"Not all\nreceive this saying, but they to whom it is given.\"[fn-71-P7143_2727474:94-nf] And when the apostle would exhort married people\nto conjugal chastity, he says, \"I would that all men were even as I myself; but every man hath his\nproper gift of God, one after this manner, another after that;\"[fn-71-P7144_2727706:95-nf] where he plainly shows not only that continence\nis a gift of God, but even the chastity of those who are married. And although these things are true,\nwe still exhort to them as much as is given to any one of us to be able to exhort, because this also\nis His gift in whose hand are both ourselves and our discourses. Whence also says the apostle,\n\"According to this grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise architect, I have laid the\nfoundation.\"[fn-71-P7145_2728178:96-nf] And in another place he says,\n\"Even as the Lord hath given to every man: I have planted, Apollos has watered, but God has given the\nincrease. Therefore neither is he that planteth anything, nor he that watereth, but God that giveth\nthe increase.\"[fn-71-P7146_2728446:97-nf] And thus as only he\npreaches and exhorts rightly who has received this gift, so assuredly he who obediently hears him who\nrightly exhorts and preaches is he who has received this gift. Hence is what the Lord said, when,\nspeaking to those who had their fleshly ears open, He nevertheless told them, \"He that hath ears to\nhear let him hear;\"[fn-71-P7147_2728806:98-nf] which beyond a doubt\nhe knew that not all had. And from whom they have, whosoever they be that have them, the Lord Himself\nshows when He says, \"I will give them a heart to know me, and ears to hear.\"[fn-71-P7148_2729025:99-nf] Therefore, having ears is itself the gift of\nobeying, so that they who had that came to Him, to whom \"no one comes unless it were given to him of\nHis Father.\" Therefore we exhort and preach, but they who have ears to hear obediently hear us, while\nin them who have them not, it comes to pass what is written, that hearing they do not hear,-hearing,\nto wit, with the bodily sense, they do not hear with the assent of the heart. But why these should\nhave ears to hear, and those have them not,-that is, why to these it should be given by the Father to\ncome to the Son, while to those it should not be given,-who has known the mind of the Lord, or who\nhas been His counsellor? Or who art thou, O man, that repliest against God? Must that which is\nmanifest be denied, because that which is hidden cannot be comprehended?

In this case also is His Body now, that is, His Church. The faith of the few \"touches\" it, the throng of the many \"press\" it.

Those who examine this matter not in a disputatious but in a calm believing spirit are invited to come to Jesus, not outwardly but in heart, not in bodily presence but in the power of faith, as the centurion did, and then they will better understand Matthew's narrative. To such it is said in the Psalm \"Come unto Him, and be enlightened; and your faces shall not be ashamed.\"[fn-25-P2557_1552799:12-nf] Hence we learn that the centurion, whose faith was so highly spoken of, came to Christ more truly than the people who carried his message. We find an analogous case in the woman with the issue of blood, who was healed by touching the hem of Christ's garment. when Christ said, \"Some one hath touched me.\" The disciples wondered what Christ meant by saying, \"Who hath touched me?\" \"Some one hath touched me,\" when the crowd was thronging Him. In fact, they made this reply: \"The crowd throngeth Thee, and sayest Thou, Who hath touched me?\"[fn-25-P2558_1553357:13-nf] Now, as the people thronged Christ while the woman touched Him, so the messengers were sent to Christ, but the centurion really came to Him. In Matthew we have a not infrequent form of expression, and at the same time a symbolical import; while in Luke there is a simple narrative of the whole event, such as to draw our attention to the manner in which Matthew has recorded it. I wish one of those people who found their silly objections to the Gospels on such trifling difficulties would himself tell a story twice over, honestly giving a true account of what happened, and that his words were written down and read over to him. We should then see whether he would not say more or less at one time than at another; and whether the order would not be changed, not only of words, but of things; and whether he would not put some opinion of his own into the mouth of another, because, though he never heard him say it, he knew it perfectly well to be in his mind; and whether he would not sometimes put in a few words what he had before related at length. In these and other ways, which might perhaps be reduced to rule, the narratives of the same thing by two persons, or two narratives by the same person, might differ in many things without being opposed, might be unlike without being contradictory.

If I put to you the instance of some man, perchance thou wilt say to me, \"It is thou that callest him wicked, for he was righteous; had he not been righteous, his prayer would not have been heard by God.\"The instance I am about to allege is of one, of whose iniquity and impiety none can doubt. The devil himself: he asked for Job, and received.[fn-43-P4379_2369045:27-nf] Have ye not here also heard concerning the devil, that \"he that committeth sin is of the devil\"?[fn-43-P4380_2369163:28-nf] Not that the devil created, but that the sinner imitates. Is it not said of him, \"He stood not in the truth\"?[fn-43-P4381_2369296:29-nf] Is not even he \"that old serpent,\" who, through the woman pledged the first man in the drink of poison?[fn-43-P4382_2369420:30-nf] Who even in the case of Job, kept for him his wife, that by her the husband might be, not comforted, but tempted? The devil asked for a holy man, to tempt him; and he received: the apostle asked that the thorn in the flesh might be taken from him, and he received not. But the apostle was more heard than the devil. For the apostle was heard for salvation, though not for his wish: the devil was heard for his wish, but for damnation. For that Job was yielded up to him to be tempted, was in order that by his standing the proof the devil should be tormented. But this, my brethren, we find not only in the Old Testament books, but also in the Gospel. The demons besought the Lord, when He expelled them from the man, that they might be permitted to go into the swine. Should the Lord not have power to tell them not to approach even those creatures? For, had it not been His will to permit this, they were not about to rebel against the King of heaven and earth. But with a view to a certain mystery, with a certain[fn-43-P4383_2370457:31-nf] ulterior meaning, He let the demons go into the swine: to show that the devil hath dominion in them that lead the life of swine.[fn-43-P4384_2370612:32-nf] Demons then were heard in their request; was the apostle not heard? Or rather (what is truer) shall we say, The apostle was heard, the demons not heard? Their will was effected; his weal was perfected.","title":"Homily VI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":8,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_138_homily_vii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"10. \"No man hath seen God at any time:\"[fn-44-P4470_2411995:30-nf] He is a thing invisible; not with the eye but with the heart must He be sought.

Hear the Gospel: \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\"[fn-44-P4471_2412333:31-nf] But let no man imagine God to himself according to the lust of his eyes. For so he makes unto himself either a huge form, or a certain incalculable magnitude which, like the light which he sees with the bodily eyes, he makes extend through all directions; field after field of space he gives it all the bigness he can; or, he represents to himself like as it were an old man of venerable form. None of these things do thou imagine. There is something thou mayest imagine, if thou wouldest see God; \"God is love.\" What sort of face hath love? what form hath it? what stature? what feet? what hands hath it? no man can say.

Have I dug out jewels from hid treasures? What of this sort have I shown to your eyes? Is my face changed while I speak? I am in the flesh; I am in the same form in which I came forth to you; ye are in the same form in which ye came hither charity is praised, and ye shout applause. Certainly ye see nothing. But as it pleases you when ye praise, so let it please you that ye may keep it in your heart. For mark well what I say brethren; I exhort you all, as God enables me, unto a great treasure. If there were shown you a beautiful little vase, embossed,[fn-44-P4474_2414312:34-nf] inlaid with gold, curiously wrought, and it charmed your eyes, and drew towards it the eager desire of your heart, and you were pleased with the hand of the artificer, and the weight of the silver, and the splendor of the metal; would not each one of you say, \"O, if I had that vase!\" And to no purpose ye would say it, for it would not rest with you to have it. Or if one should wish to have it, he might think of stealing it from another's house. Charity is praised to you; if it please you, have it, possess it: no need that ye should rob any man, no need that ye should think of buying it; it is to be had freely, without cost.

They affirm that the Lord came in the last times of the world to endure suffering, for this end, that He might indicate the passion which occurred to the last of the Aeons, and might by His own end announce the cessation of that disturbance which had risen among the Aeons. They maintain, further, that that girl of twelve years old, the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue,[fn-63-P6311_1450590:97-nf] to whom the Lord approached and raised her from the dead, was a type of Achamoth, to whom their Christ, by extending himself, imparted shape, and whom he led anew to the perception of that light which had forsaken her. And that the Saviour appeared to her when she lay outside of the Pleroma as a kind of abortion, they affirm Paul to have declared in his Epistle to the Corinthians [in these words], \"And last of all, He appeared to me also, as to one born out of due time.\"[fn-63-P6312_1451086:98-nf] Again, the coming of the Saviour with His attendants to Achamoth is declared in like manner by him in the same Epistle, when he says, \"A woman ought to have a veil upon her head, because of the angels.\"[fn-63-P6313_1451308:99-nf] Now, that Achamoth, when the Saviour came to her, drew a veil over herself through modesty, Moses rendered manifest when he put a veil upon his face.

To this house it is said, \"Forbearing one another in love, endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace;\"[fn-45-P4552_2277296:154-nf] and, \"For the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.\"[fn-45-P4553_2277377:155-nf] For this house is composed of those that are good and faithful, and of the holy servants of God dispersed throughout the world, and bound together by the unity of the Spirit, whether they know each other personally or not. But we hold that others are said to be in the house after such a sort, that they belong not to the substance of the house, nor to the society of fruitful and peaceful justice, but only as the chaff is said to be among the corn; for that they are in the house we cannot deny, when the apostle says, \"But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some to dishonor.\"[fn-45-P4554_2278066:156-nf] Of this countless multitude are found to be not only the crowd which within the Church afflicts the hearts of the saints, who are so few in comparison with so vast a host, but also the heresies and schisms which exist in those who have burst the meshes of the net, and may now be said to be rather out of the house than in the house, of whom it is said, \"They went out from us, but they were not of us.\"[fn-45-P4555_2278981:157-nf] For they are more thoroughly separated, now that they are also divided from us in the body, than are those who live within the Church in a carnal and worldly fashion, and are separated from us in the spirit.","title":"Book VII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":8,"verse":41,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_44_sermon_xxvii_lxxvii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"6.

And in the Epistle to the Corinthians, he says, that \"to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge\" (1 Cor. xii. 8, 11); and that It divideth all as It willeth. And in addressing the Milesians, he says, \"Over which the Holy Ghost hath made you shepherds and overseers.\" (Acts xx. 28.)

For it was not by having toiled much and labored that we had this dignity allotted to us, but we received grace, and the successful result is a part of he heavenly gift. \"For obedience to the faith.\" So it was not the Apostles that achieved it, but grace that paved the way before them.

For when the Master declareth aught, they that hear should not be nice and curious handlers of what is told them, but receivers only; for this is why the Apostles were sent, to speak what they had heard, not to add aught from their own stock, and that we for our part should believe-that we should believe what?-\"concerning His Name.\" Not that we should be curious about the essence, but that we should believe on the Name; for this it was which also wrought the miracles. For it says, \"in the Name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk.\" (Acts iii. 6.) And this too requireth faith, neither can one grasp aught of these things by reasoning (logismw katagabein). \"Among all nations, among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ.\" What? did Paul preach then to all the nations? Now that he ran through the whole space from Jerusalem to Illyricum, and from thence again went forth to the very ends of the earth, is plain from what he writes to the Romans; but even if he did not come to all, yet still what he says is not false, for he speaks not of himself alone, but of the twelve Apostles, and all who declared the word after them. And in another sense, one should not see any fault to find with the phrase, if about himself, when one considers his ready mind, and how that after death he ceaseth not to preach in all parts of the world. And consider how he extols the gift, and shows that it is great and much more lofty than the former, since the old things were with one nation, but this gift drew sea and land to itself. And attend to this too, how free the mind of Paul is from all flattery; for when conversing with the Romans, who were seated as it were upon a sort of summit of the whole world, he attaches no more to them than to the other nations, nor does he on the score of their being then in power and ruling, say, that they have in spiritual things also any advantage.

This also He did in like manner in the case of the wine; for He did not merely show it to them, but also caused it to be borne to the governor of the feast, in order that one who knew nothing of what had been done, by his confession might bear to Him unsuspected testimony; wherefore the Evangelist saith, that the ruler of the feast \"knew not whence it was,\" thus showing the impartiality of his testimony. And in another place, when He raised the dead, He said, \"Give ye him to eat\";[fn-19-P1941_659083:8-nf] supplying this proof of a real resurrection, and by these means persuading even the foolish that He was no deceiver, no dealer in illusions,[fn-19-P1942_659271:9-nf] but that He had come for the salvation of the common nature of mankind.","title":"Homily XXXVII.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":8,"verse":54,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_26_tractate_xxi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"11.

For Lazarus rose to die again; we shall rise again to live for ever. Is it the Father that effects such a resurrection, or the Son? Nay verily, the Father in the Son. Consequently the Son, and the Father in the Son. Whence do we prove that He speaks of this resurrection? When He had said, \"As the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them, so also the Son quickeneth whom He will.\" Lest we should understand here that resurrection which He performs for a miracle, not for eternal life, He proceeded, saying, \"For the Father judgeth not any man, but all judgment hath He given to the Son.\" What is this? He was speaking of the resurrection of the dead, that \"as the Father raiseth the dead, and quickeneth them, so also the Son quickeneth whom He will;\" and immediately thereupon added as a reason, concerning the judgment, saying, \"for the Father judgeth not any man, but all judgment hath He given to the Son.\" Why said He this, but to indicate that He had spoken of that resurrection of the dead which will take place in the judgment?","title":"Tractate XXI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":8,"verse":43,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_33_part_i_containing_various_sections_of_the_works_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"96","folder":"ANF-06","text":"The question touching women in the time of their separation, whether it is proper for them when in such a condition to enter the house of God, I consider a superfluous inquiry.

If he is drawn, saith some one, he comes unwillingly. If he comes unwillingly, then he believes not; but if he believes not, neither does he come. For we do not run to Christ on foot, but by believing; nor is it by a motion of the body, but by the inclination of the heart that we draw nigh to Him. This is why that woman who touched the hem of His garment touched Him more than did the crowd that pressed Him. Therefore the Lord said, \"Who touched me?\" And the disciples wondering said, \"The multitude throng Thee, and press Thee, and sayest Thou, Vho touched me?\"[fn-12-P1271_802099:7-nf] And He repeated it, \"Somebody hath touched me.\" That woman touched, the multitude pressed.

For it has been sown by Apostles and Prophets. The Lord Himself sowed it. For He was in the Apostles, seeing that Christ also Himself reaped it. For they are nothing without Him; He is perfect without them. For He saith Himself to them, \"For without Me, ye can do nothing.\"[fn-52-P5261_2237585:15-nf] What then doth Christ from henceforth sowing among the Gentiles say? \"A sower went out to sow.\"[fn-52-P5262_2237698:16-nf] \"There\" are reapers \"sent out \"to reap,\" here \"an unwearied sower \"went out\" to sow.
