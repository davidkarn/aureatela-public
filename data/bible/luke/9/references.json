But, for these purposes, \"There is nought of communion between light and darkness,\"[fn-7-P741_307859:94-nf] between life and death or else we rescind what is written, \"The world shall rejoice, but ye shall grieve.\"[fn-7-P742_308118:95-nf] If we rejoice with the world, there is reason to fear that with the world we shall grieve too. But when the world rejoices, let us grieve; and when the world afterward grieves, we shall rejoice. Thus, too, Eleazar[fn-7-P743_308422:96-nf] in Hades,[fn-7-P744_308469:97-nf] (attaining refreshment in Abraham's bosom) and the rich man, (on the other hand, set in the torment of fire) compensate, by an answerable retribution, their alternate vicissitudes of evil and good. There are certain gift-days, which with some adjust the claim of honour, with others the debt of wages. \"Now, then,\" you say, \"I shall receive back what is mine, or pay back what is another's.\" If men have consecrated for themselves this custom from superstition, why do you, estranged as you are from all their vanity, participate in solemnities consecrated to idols; as if for you also there were some prescript about a day, short of the observance of a particular day, to prevent your paying or receiving what you owe a man, or what is owed you by a man? Give me the form after which you wish to be dealt with. For why should you skulk withal, when you contaminate your own conscience by your neighbour's ignorance? If you are not unknown to be a Christian, you are tempted, and you act as if you were not a Christian against your neighbour's conscience; if, however, you shall be disguised withal,[fn-7-P745_309810:98-nf] you are the slave of the temptation. At all events, whether in the latter or the former way, you are guilty of being \"ashamed of God.\"[fn-7-P746_310171:99-nf] But \"whosoever shall be ashamed of Me in the presence of men, of him will I too be ashamed,\" says He, \"in the presence of my Father who is in the heavens.\"[fn-7-P747_310367:100-nf] ","title":"On Idolatry.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":9,"verse":58,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_07_on_idolatry_","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"63","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But we must now treat of the garb only and apparatus of office.

But great and holy men, although they at the time knew excellently well that that death which separates the soul from the body is not to be dreaded, yet, in accordance with the sentiment of those who might fear it, punished some sins with death, both because the living were struck with a salutary fear, and because it was not death itself that would injure those who were being punished with death, but sin, which might be increased if they continued to live. They did not judge rashly on whom God had bestowed such a power of judging. Hence it is that Elijah inflicted death on many, both with his own hand[fn-5-P510_175839:190-nf] and by calling down fire from heaven;[fn-5-P511_175903:191-nf] as was done also without rashness by many other great and godlike men, in the same spirit of concern for the good of humanity. And when the disciples had quoted an example from this Elias, mentioning to the Lord what had been done by him, in order that He might give to themselves also the power of calling down fire from heaven to consume those who would not show Him hospitality, the Lord reproved in them, not the example of the holy prophet, but their ignorance in respect to taking vengeance, their knowledge being as yet elementary;[fn-5-P512_176464:192-nf] perceiving that they did not in love desire correction, but in hated desired revenge.

We are told, for instance, that lamentation was made for Moses; yet when the funeral of Joshua is described[fn-12-P1241_266494:836-nf] no mention at all is made of weeping. The reason, of course, is that under Moses-that is under the old Law-all men were bound by the sentence passed on Adam's sin, and when they descended into hell[fn-12-P1242_266715:837-nf] were rightly accompanied with tears. For, as the apostle says, \"death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned.\"[fn-12-P1243_266898:838-nf] But under Jesus,[fn-12-P1244_266934:839-nf] that is, under the Gospel of Christ, who has unlocked for us the gate of paradise, death is accompanied, not with sorrow, but with joy. The Jews go on weeping to this day; they make bare their feet, they crouch in sackcloth, they roll in ashes. And to make their superstition complete, they follow a foolish custom of the Pharisees, and eat lentils,[fn-12-P1245_267341:840-nf] to show, it would seem, for what poor fare they have lost their birthright.[fn-12-P1246_267571:841-nf] Of course they are right to weep, for as they do not believe in the Lord's resurrection they are being made ready for the advent of antichrist. But we who have put on Christ[fn-12-P1247_267766:842-nf] and according to the apostle are a royal and priestly race,[fn-12-P1248_267847:843-nf] we ought not to grieve for the dead. \"Moses,\" the Scripture tells us, \"said unto Aaron and unto Eleazar, and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left: Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people.\"[fn-12-P1249_268122:844-nf] Rend not your clothes, he says, neither mourn as pagans, lest you die. For, for us sin is death. In this same book, Leviticus, there is a provision which may perhaps strike some as cruel, yet is necessary to faith: the high priest is forbidden to approach the dead bodies of his father and mother, of his brothers and of his children;[fn-12-P1250_268487:845-nf] to the end, that no grief may distract a soul engaged in offering sacrifice to God, and wholly devoted to the Divine mysteries. Are we not taught the same lesson in theGospel in other words? Is not the disciple forbidden to say farewell to his home or to bury his dead father?[fn-12-P1251_268788:846-nf] Of the high priest, again, it is said: \"He shall not go out of the sanctuary, and the sanctification of his God shall not be contaminated, for the anointing oil of his God is upon him.\"[fn-12-P1252_268997:847-nf] Certainly, now that we have believed in Christ, and bear Him within us, by reason of the oil of His anointing which we have received,[fn-12-P1253_269158:848-nf] we ought not to depart from His temple-that is, from our Christian profession-we ought not to go forth to mingle with the unbelieving Gentiles, but always to remain within, as servants obedient to the will of the Lord.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":9,"verse":62,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"851","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1.

He who has contracted the obligations of marriage, is bound, and he who is bound is a slave; on the other hand he who is loosed is free. Since therefore you rejoice in the freedom of Christ, since your life is better than your profession, since you are all but on the housetop of which the Saviour speaks; you ought not to come down to take your clothes,[fn-55-P5519_1540000:3916-nf] you ought not to look behind you, you ought not having put your hand to the plough, then to let it go.[fn-55-P5520_1540144:3917-nf] Rather, if you can, imitate Joseph and leave your garment in the hand of your Egyptian mistress,[fn-55-P5521_1540263:3918-nf] that naked you may follow your Lord and Saviour.

Cyprian to Magnus his son, greeting. With your usual religious diligence, you have consulted my poor intelligence, dearest son, as to whether, among other heretics, they also who come from Novatian ought, after his profane washing, to be baptized, and sanctified in the Catholic Church, with the lawful, and true, and only baptism of the Church. Respecting which matter, as much as the capacity of my faith and the sanctity and truth of the divine Scriptures suggest, I answer, that no heretics and schismatics at all have any power or right. For which reason Novatian neither ought to be nor can be expected, inasmuch as he also is without the Church and acting in opposition to the peace and love of Christ, from being counted among adversaries and antichrists. For our Lord Jesus Christ, when He testified in His Gospel that those who were not with Him were His adversaries, did not point out any species of heresy, but showed that all whatsoever who were not with Him, and who, not gathering with Him, were scattering His flock, were His adversaries; saying, \"He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.\"[fn-64-P6477_2085279:2-nf] Moreover, the blessed Apostle John himself distinguished no heresy or schism, neither did he set down any as specially separated; but he called all who had gone out from the Church, and who acted in opposition to the Church, antichrists, saying, \"Ye have heard that Antichrist cometh, and even now are come many antichrists; wherefore we know that this is the last time. They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us.\"[fn-64-P6478_2085850:3-nf] Whence it appears, that all are adversaries of the Lord and antichrists, who are known to have departed from charity and from the unity of the Catholic Church. In addition, moreover, the Lord establishes it in His Gospel, and says, \"But if he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a publican.\"[fn-64-P6479_2086198:4-nf] Now if they who despise the Church are counted heathens and publicans, much more certainly is it necessary that rebels and enemies, who forge false altars, and lawless priesthoods, and sacrilegious sacrifices, and corrupter names, should be counted among heathens and publicans; since they who sin less, and are only despisers of the Church, are by the Lord's sentence judged to be heathens and publicans.","title":"Epistle LXXV.","author":"Cyprian"},{"chapter":9,"verse":60,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_11_book_i_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"76","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"They who say that Adam was so formed that he would even without any demerit of sin have died, not as the penalty of sin, but from the necessity of his being, endeavour indeed to refer that passage in the law, which says: \"On the day ye eat thereof ye shall surely die,\"[fn-2-P283_315973:3-nf] not to the death of the body, but to that death of the soul which takes place in sin.

When he was asserting the fitness of infants only just born to receive Christ's baptism, on a certain occasion when he was consulted whether this ought to be administered before the eighth day, he endeavoured, as far as he could, to prove that they were perfect,[fn-11-P1166_606844:20-nf] lest any one should suppose, from the number of the days (because it was on the eighth day that infants were before circumcised), that they so far lacked perfection. However, after bestowing upon them the full support of his argument, he still confessed that they were not free from original sin; because if he had denied this, he would have removed all reason for the very baptism which he was maintaining their fitness to receive. You can, if you wish, read for yourself the epistle of the illustrious martyr On the Baptism of Little Children; for it cannot fail to be within reach at Carthage. But I have deemed it right to transcribe some few statements of it into this letter of mine, so far as applies to the question before us; and I pray you to mark them carefully. \"Now with respect,\" says he, \"to the case of infants, whom you declared itwould be improper to baptize if presented within the second and third day after their birth, since that due regard ought to be paid to the law of circumcision of old, so that you thought that the infant should not be baptized and sanctified before the eighth day after its birth,-a far different view has been formed of the question in our council. Not a man there assented to what you thought ought to be done; but the whole of us rather determined that to no one born of men ought God's mercy and grace to be denied. For since the Lord in His gospel says, \"The Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them,\"[fn-11-P1167_608379:21-nf] so far as in us lies, not a soul ought, if possible, to be lost.\" You observe how in these words he supposes that it is fraught with ruin and death, not only to the flesh, but also to the soul, for one to depart this life without that saving sacrament. Wherefore, if he said nothing else, it was competent to us to conclude from his words that without sin the soul could not perish. See, however, what (when he shortly afterwards maintains the innocence of infants) he at the same time allows concerning them in the plainest terms: \"But if,\" says he, \"anything could hinder men from the attainment of grace, then their heavier sins might rather hinder those who have reached the stages of adults, and advanced life, and old age. Since, however, remission of sins is given even to the greatest sinners after they have believed, however much they have previously sinned against God, and since nobody is forbidden baptism and grace, how much more ought an infant not to be forbidden who newborn has done no sin, except that from havingbeen born cam ally after Adam he has contracted from his very birth the contagion of the primeval death!

He was, as I have often said,[fn-19-P1950_852366:81-nf] a remarkably eloquent man, and well-instructed in philosophy. But he had particularly cultivated logic, and was profoundly skilled in the interpretation of the holy Scriptures; insomuch that the heretic Eunomius often shrank from the acumen which his reasoning displayed. As regards his diet he was not simple; for although he practised the strictest moderation, yet his table was always sumptuously furnished. He was also accustomed to indulge himself by wearing white garments, and bathing twice a day in the public baths. And when some one asked him `why he, a bishop, bathed himself twice a day?' he replied, `Because it is inconvenient to bathe thrice.' Going one day from courtesy to visit the bishop Arsacius, he was asked by one of the friends of that bishop, `why he wore a garment so unsuitable for a bishop? and where it was written that an ecclesiastic should be clothed in white?' `Do you tell me first,' said he, `where it is written that a bishop should wear black?' When he that made the inquiry knew not what to reply to this counter-question: `You cannot show,' rejoined Sisinnius, `that a priest should be clothed in black.

For those things in regard to the substance of God, which needed at any time to be represented in some outward way, and so exhibited themselves to men's bodily senses, and then passed away, were formed for the moment by divine power from the subservient creation, and not from the dominant nature itself; which, ever abiding the same, excites into action whatever it pleases; and, itself unchangeable, changes all things else at its pleasure. In the same way also did that voice from the cloud actually strike upon the bodily ears, and on that bodily sense which is called the hearing;[fn-32-P3287_1830252:12-nf] and yet in no way are we to believe that the Word of God, which is the only-begotten Son, is defined, because He is called the Word, by syllables and sounds: for when a sermon is in course of delivery, all the sounds cannot be pronounced simultaneously; but the various individual sounds come, as it were, in their own order to the birth, and succeed those which are dying away, so that all that we have to say is completed only by the last syllable. Very different from this, surely, is the way in which the Father speaketh to the Son, that is to say, God to God, His Word. But this, so far as it can be understood by man, is a matter for the understanding of those who are fitted for the reception of solid food, and not of milk. Since, therefore, the Holy Spirit became not man by any assumption of humanity, and became not an angel by any assumption of angelic nature, and as little entered into the creature-state by the assumption of any creature-form whatever, how, in regard to Him, are we to understand those words of our Lord, \"For He shall not speak of Himself; but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak\"? A difficult question; yea, too difficult.

For it is in vain that an additional law has been reared, condemning the origin even of sins-that is, concupiscences and wills-no less than the actual deeds; if the fact that pardon was of old in some cases conceded to adultery is to be a reason why it shall be conceded at the present day. \"What will be the reward attaching to the restrictions imposed upon the more fully developed discipline of the present day, except that the eider (discipline) may be made the agent for granting indulgence to your prostitution? \"In that case, you will grant pardon to the idolater too, and to every apostate, because we find the People itself, so often guilty of these crimes, as often reinstated in their former privileges.

He says to the Lord, \"the people is full and maketh idols.\" Moses with empty stomach received the law written with the finger of God. The people that ate and drank and rose up to play fashioned a golden calf, and preferred an Egyptian ox to the majesty of the Lord. The toil of so many days perished through the fulness of a single hour. Moses boldly broke the tables: for he knew that drunkards cannot hear the word of God.[fn-67-P6742_2130843:133-nf] \"The beloved grew thick, waxed fat, and became sleek: he kicked and forsook the Lord which made him, and departed from the God of his salvation.\" Hence also it is enjoined in the same Book of Deuteronomy:[fn-67-P6743_2131154:134-nf] \"Beware, lest when thou hast eaten and drunk, and hast built goodly houses, and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and gold is multiplied, then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God.\" In short the people ate and their heart grew thick, lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart: so the people well fed and fat-fleshed could not bear the countenance of Moses who fasted, for, to correctly render the Hebrew, it was[fn-67-P6744_2131689:135-nf] furnished with horns through his converse with God. And it was not, as some think, to show that there is no difference between virginity and marriage, but to assert his sympathy with severe fasting, that our Lord and Saviour when he was transfigured on the Mount revealed Moses and Elias with Himself in glory. Although Moses and Elias were properly types of the Law and the Prophets, as is clearly witnessed by the Gospel:[fn-67-P6745_2132373:136-nf] \"They spake of his departure which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.\" For the passion of our Lord is declared not by virginity or marriage, but by the Law and the Prophets. If, however, any persons contentiously maintain that by Moses is signified marriage, by Elias virginity, let me tell them briefly that Moses died and was buried, but Elias was carried off in a chariot of fire and entered on immortality before he approached death. But the second writing of the tables could not be effected without fasting. What was lost by drunkenness was regained by abstinence, a proof that by fasting we can return to paradise, whence, though fulness, we have been expelled. In[fn-67-P6746_2133071:137-nf] Exodus we read that the battle was fought against Amalek while Moses prayed, and the whole people fasted until the evening.[fn-67-P6747_2133215:138-nf] Joshua, the son of Nun, bade sun and moon stand still, and the victorious army prolonged its fast for more than a day.[fn-67-P6748_2133354:139-nf] Saul, as it is written in the first book of Kings, pronounced a curse on him who ate bread before the evening, and until he had avenged himself upon his enemies. So none of his people tasted any food. And all they of the land took food. And so binding was a solemn fast once it was proclaimed to the Lord, that Jonathan, to whom the victory was due, was taken by lot, and[fn-67-P6749_2133964:140-nf] could not escape the charge of sinning in ignorance, and his father's hand was raised against him, and the prayers of the people scarce availed to save him.[fn-67-P6750_2134144:141-nf] Elijah after the preparation of a forty days fast saw God on Mount Horeb, and heard from Him the words, \"What doest thou here, Elijah?\" There is much more familiarity in this than in the \"Where art thou, Adam?\" of Genesis. The latter was intended to excite the fears of one who had fed and was lost; the former was affectionately addressed to a fasting servant.[fn-67-P6751_2134533:142-nf] When the people were assembled in Mizpeh, Samuel proclaimed a fast, and so strengthened them, and thus made them prevail against the enemy.[fn-67-P6752_2134695:143-nf] The attack of the Assyrians was repulsed, and the might of Sennacherib utterly crushed, by the tears and sackcloth of King Hezekiah, and by his humbling himself with fasting. So also the city of Nineveh by fasting excited compassion and turned aside the threatening wrath of the Lord. And[fn-67-P6753_2135006:144-nf] Sodom and Gomorrha might have appeased it, had they been willing to repent, and through the aid of fasting gain for themselves tears of repentance.[fn-67-P6754_2135180:145-nf] Ahab, the most impious of kings, by fasting and wearing sackcloth, succeeded in escaping the sentence of God, and in deferring the overthrow of his house to the days of his posterity.[fn-67-P6755_2135391:146-nf] Hannah, the wife of Elkanah, by fasting won the gift of a son.[fn-67-P6756_2135489:147-nf] At Babylon the magicians came into peril, every interpreter of dreams, soothsayer, and diviner was slain.

Then it is written that Daniel fasted for three weeks; he ate no pleasant bread; flesh and wine entered not his mouth; he was not anointed with oil; and the angel came to him saying,[fn-67-P6757_2135981:148-nf] \"Daniel, thou art worthy of compassion.\" He who in the eyes of God was worthy of compassion, afterwards was an object of terror to the lions in their den. How fair a thing is that which propitiates God, tames lions, terrifies demons!Habakkuk (although we do not find this in the Hebrew Scriptures[fn-67-P6758_2136344:149-nf] ) was sent to him with the reaper's meal, for by a week's abstinence he had merited so distinguished a server. David, when his son was in danger after his adultery, made confession in ashes and with fasting.[fn-67-P6759_2136618:150-nf] He tells us that he ate ashes like bread, and mingled his drink with weeping.[fn-67-P6760_2136715:151-nf] And that his knees became weak through fasting. Yet he had certainly heard from Nathan the words,[fn-67-P6761_2136833:152-nf] \"The Lord also hath put away thy sin.\" Samson and Samuel drank neither wine nor strong drink, for they were children of promise, and conceived in abstinence and fasting.[fn-67-P6762_2137026:153-nf] Aaron and the other priests when about to enter the temple, refrained from all intoxicating drink for fear they should die. Whence we learn that they die who minister in the Church without sobriety. And hence it is a reproach against Israel:[fn-67-P6763_2137286:154-nf] \"Ye gave my Nazarites wine to drink.\" Jonadab, the son of Rechab, commanded his sons to drink no wine for ever. And when Jeremiah offered them wine to drink, and they of their own accord refused it, the Lord spake by the prophet, saying:[fn-67-P6764_2137544:155-nf] \"Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.\" On the[fn-67-P6765_2137714:156-nf] threshold of the Gospel appears Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, the wife of one husband, and a woman who was always fasting. Long-continued chastity and persistent fasting welcomed a Virgin Lord. His forerunner and herald, John, fed on locusts and wild honey, not on flesh; and the hermits of the desert and the monks in their cells, at first used the same sustenance. But the Lord Himself consecrated His baptism by a forty days' fast, and He taught us that the more violent devils[fn-67-P6766_2138219:157-nf] cannot be overcome, except by prayer and fasting.[fn-67-P6767_2138561:158-nf] Cornelius the centurion was found worthy through alms-giving and frequent fasts to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit before baptism.[fn-67-P6768_2138714:159-nf] The Apostle Paul, after speaking of hunger and thirst, and his other labours, perils from robbers, shipwrecks, loneliness, enumerates frequent fasts. And he[fn-67-P6769_2138893:160-nf] advises his disciple Timothy, who had a weak stomach, and was subject to many infirmities, to drink wine in moderation: \"Drink no longer water,\" he says. The fact that he bids him no longer drink water shows that he had previously drunk water. The apostle would not have allowed this had not frequent infirmities and bodily pain demanded the concession.","title":"Book II.","author":false},{"chapter":9,"verse":28,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_21_viii_on_fasting_in_opposition_to_the_psychics_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"35","folder":"ANF-04","text":"On the other hand, he whose \"heart\" was habitually found \"lifted up\"[fn-17-P1760_516565:39-nf] rather than fattened up, who in forty days and as many nights maintained a fast above the power of human nature, while spiritual faith subministered strength (to his body),[fn-17-P1761_516813:40-nf] both saw with his eyes God's glory, and heard with his ears God's voice, and understood with his heart God's law: while He taught him even then (by experience) that man liveth not upon bread alone, but upon every word of God; in that the People, though fatter than he, could not constantly contemplate even Moses himself, fed as he had been upon God, nor his leanness, sated as it had been with His glory![fn-17-P1762_517286:41-nf] Deservedly, therefore, even while in the flesh, did the Lord show Himself to him, the colleague of His own fasts, no less than to Elijah.[fn-17-P1763_517477:42-nf] For Elijah withal had, by this fact primarily, that he had imprecated a famine,[fn-17-P1764_517615:43-nf] already sufficiently devoted himself to fasts: \"The Lord liveth,\" he said, \"before whom I am standing in His sight, if there shall be dew in these years, and rain-shower.\"[fn-17-P1765_517810:44-nf] Subsequently, fleeing from threatening Jezebel, after one single (meal of) food and drink, which he had found on being awakened by an angel, he too himself, in a space of forty days and nights, his belly empty, his mouth dry, arrived at Mount Horeb; where, when he had made a cave his inn, with how familiar a meeting with God was he received![fn-17-P1766_518202:45-nf] \"What (doest) thou, Elijah, here? \"[fn-17-P1767_518307:46-nf] Much more friendly was this voice than, \"Adam, where art thou? \"[fn-17-P1768_518390:47-nf] For the latter voice was uttering a threat to a fed man, the former soothing a fasting one.

And wouldest thou know certainly, that the Cross is a glory to Jesus? Hear His own words, not mine. Judas had become ungrateful to the Master of the house, and was about to betray Him. Having but just now gone forth from the table, and drunk His cup of blessing, in return for that drought of salvation he sought to shed righteous blood. He who did eat of His bread, was lifting up his heel against Him[fn-16-P1630_449072:23-nf] ; his hands were but lately receiving the blessed gifts[fn-16-P1631_449145:24-nf] , and presently for the wages of betrayal he was plotting His death.

For He, not for one day, but during forty years, not on the inferior aliment of bread and fish, but with the manna of heaven, supported the lives[fn-60-P6084_1827307:786-nf] of not five thousand, but of six hundred thousand human beings. However, such was the greatness of His miracle, that He willed the slender supply of food, not only to be enough, but even to prove superabundant;[fn-60-P6085_1827537:787-nf] and herein He followed the ancient precedent. For in like manner, during the famine in Elijah's time, the scanty and final meal of the widow of Sarepta was multiplied[fn-60-P6086_1827722:788-nf] by the blessing of the prophet throughout the period of the famine. You have the third book of the Kings.[fn-60-P6087_1827850:789-nf] If you also turn to the fourth book, you will discover all this conduct[fn-60-P6088_1827949:790-nf] of Christ pursued by that man of God, who ordered ten[fn-60-P6089_1828019:791-nf] barley loaves which had been given him to be distributed among the people; and when his servitor, after contrasting the large number of the persons with the small supply of the food, answered, \"What, shall I set this before a hundred men? \"he said again, \"Give them, and they shall eat: for thus saith the Lord, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof, according to the word of the Lord.\"[fn-60-P6090_1828600:792-nf] O Christ, even in Thy novelties Thou art old! Accordingly, when Peter, who had been an eye-witness of the miracle, and had compared it with the ancient precedents, and had discovered in them prophetic intimations of what should one day come to pass, answered (as the mouthpiece of them all) the Lord's inquiry, \"Whom say ye that I am? \"[fn-60-P6091_1828963:793-nf] in the words, \"Thou art the Christ,\" he could not but have perceived that He was that Christ, beside whom he knew of none else in the Scriptures, and whom he was now surveying[fn-60-P6092_1829159:794-nf] in His wonderful deeds. This conclusion He even Himself confirms by thus far bearing with it, nay, even enjoining silence respecting it.[fn-60-P6093_1829315:795-nf] For if Peter was unable to acknowledge Him to be any other than the Creator's Christ, while He commanded them \"to tell no man that saying,\" surely[fn-60-P6094_1829482:796-nf] He was unwilling to have the conclusion promulged which Peter had drawn. No doubt of that,[fn-60-P6095_1829588:797-nf] you say; but as Peter's conclusion was a wrong one, therefore He was unwilling to have a lie disseminated. It was, however, a different reason which He assigned for the silence, even because \"the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and scribes, and priests, and be slain, and be raised again the third day.\"[fn-60-P6096_1829940:798-nf] Now, inasmuch as these sufferings were actually foretold for the Creator's Christ (as we shall fully show in the proper place[fn-60-P6097_1830086:799-nf] ), so by this application of them to His own case[fn-60-P6098_1830172:800-nf] does He prove that it is He Himself of whom they were predicted. At all events, even if they had not been predicted, the reason which He alleged for imposing silence (on the disciples) was such as made it clear enough that Peter had made no mistake, that reason being the necessity of His undergoing these sufferings. \"Whosoever,\" says He, \"will save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.\"[fn-60-P6099_1830638:801-nf] Surely[fn-61-P6100_1830665:802-nf] it is the Son of man[fn-61-P6101_1830700:803-nf] who uttered this sentence. Look carefully, then, along with the king of Babylon, into his burning fiery furnace, and there you will discover one \"like the Son of man\" (for He was not yet really Son of man, because not yet born of man), even as early as then[fn-61-P6102_1831007:804-nf] appointing issues such as these. He saved the lives of the three brethren,[fn-61-P6103_1831099:805-nf] who had agreed to lose them for God's sake; but He destroyed those of the Chaldµans, when they had preferred to save them by the means of their idolatry. Where is that novelty, which you pretend[fn-61-P6104_1831319:806-nf] in a doctrine which possesses these ancient proofs? But all the predictions have been fulfilled[fn-61-P6105_1831428:807-nf] concerning martyrdoms which were to happen, and were to receive the recompenses of their reward from God. \"See,\" says Isaiah, \"how the righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and just men are taken away, and no man considereth.\"[fn-61-P6106_1831692:808-nf] When does this more frequently happen than in the persecution of His saints? This, indeed, is no ordinary matter,[fn-61-P6107_1831827:809-nf] no common casualty of the law of nature; but it is that illustrious devotion, that fighting for the faith, wherein whosoever loses his life for God saves it, so that you may here again recognize the Judge who recompenses the evil gain of life with its destruction, and the good loss thereof with its salvation. It is, however, a jealous God whom He here presents to me one who returns evil for evil. \"For whosoever,\" says He, \"shall be ashamed of me, of him will I also be ashamed.\"[fn-61-P6108_1832497:810-nf] Now to none but my Christ can be assigned the occasion[fn-61-P6109_1832572:811-nf] of such a shame as this. His whole course[fn-61-P6110_1832640:812-nf] was so exposed to shame as to open a way for even the taunts of heretics, declaiming[fn-61-P6111_1832738:813-nf] with all the bitterness in their power against the utter disgrace[fn-61-P6112_1832825:814-nf] of His birth and bringing-up, and the unworthiness of His very flesh.[fn-61-P6113_1832914:815-nf] But how can that Christ of yours be liable to a shame, which it is impossible for him to experience? Since he was never condensed[fn-61-P6114_1833511:816-nf] into human flesh in the womb of a woman, although a virgin; never grew from human seed, although only after the law of corporeal substance, from the fluids[fn-61-P6115_1833699:817-nf] of a woman; was never deemed flesh before shaped in the womb; never called f£tus[fn-61-P6116_1833806:818-nf] after such shaping; was never delivered from a ten months' writhing in the womb;[fn-61-P6117_1834077:819-nf] was never shed forth upon the ground, amidst the sudden pains of parturition, with the unclean issue which flows at such a time through the sewerage of the body, forthwith to inaugurate the light[fn-61-P6118_1834725:820-nf] of life with tears, and with that primal wound which severs the child from her who bears him;[fn-61-P6119_1834860:821-nf] never received the copious ablution, nor the meditation of salt and honey;[fn-61-P6120_1835064:822-nf] nor did he initiate a shroud with swaddling clothes;[fn-61-P6121_1835306:823-nf] nor afterwards did he ever wallow[fn-61-P6122_1835395:824-nf] in his own uncleanness, in his mother's lap; nibbling at her breast; long an infant; gradually[fn-61-P6123_1835524:825-nf] a boy; by slow degrees[fn-61-P6124_1835559:826-nf] a man.[fn-61-P6125_1835580:827-nf] But he was revealed[fn-61-P6126_1835618:828-nf] from heaven, full-grown at once, at once complete; immediately Christ; simply spirit, and power, and god. But as withal he was not true, because not visible; therefore he was no object to be ashamed of from the curse of the cross, the real endurance[fn-61-P6127_1835924:829-nf] of which he escaped, because wanting in bodily substance. Never, therefore, could he have said, \"Whosoever shall be ashamed of me.\" But as for our Christ, He could do no otherwise than make such a declaration;[fn-61-P6128_1836151:830-nf] \"made\" by the Father \"a little lower than the angels,\"[fn-61-P6129_1836234:831-nf] \"a worm and no man, a reproach of men, and despised of the people; \"[fn-61-P6130_1836323:832-nf] seeing that it was His will that \"with His stripes we should be healed,\"[fn-61-P6131_1836416:833-nf] that by His humiliation our salvation should be established. And justly did He humble Himself[fn-61-P6132_1836531:834-nf] for His own creature man, for the image and likeness of Himself, and not of another, in order that man, since he had not felt ashamed when bowing down to a stone or a stock, might with similar courage give satisfaction to God for the shamelessness of his idolatry, by displaying an equal degree of shamelessness in his faith, in not being ashamed of Christ. Now, Marcion, which of these courses is better suited to your Christ, in respect of a meritorious shame?[fn-61-P6133_1837014:835-nf] Plainly, you ought yourself to blush with shame for having given him a fictitious existence.[fn-61-P6134_1837138:836-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":9,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":23,"source_paragraph":"91","folder":"ANF-03","text":"He sends forth His disciples to preach the kingdom of God.[fn-60-P6073_1825470:775-nf] Does He here say of what God?

This conclusion He even Himself confirms by thus far bearing with it, nay, even enjoining silence respecting it.[fn-60-P6093_1829315:795-nf] For if Peter was unable to acknowledge Him to be any other than the Creator's Christ, while He commanded them \"to tell no man that saying,\" surely[fn-60-P6094_1829482:796-nf] He was unwilling to have the conclusion promulged which Peter had drawn. No doubt of that,[fn-60-P6095_1829588:797-nf] you say; but as Peter's conclusion was a wrong one, therefore He was unwilling to have a lie disseminated. It was, however, a different reason which He assigned for the silence, even because \"the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and scribes, and priests, and be slain, and be raised again the third day.\"[fn-60-P6096_1829940:798-nf] Now, inasmuch as these sufferings were actually foretold for the Creator's Christ (as we shall fully show in the proper place[fn-60-P6097_1830086:799-nf] ), so by this application of them to His own case[fn-60-P6098_1830172:800-nf] does He prove that it is He Himself of whom they were predicted. At all events, even if they had not been predicted, the reason which He alleged for imposing silence (on the disciples) was such as made it clear enough that Peter had made no mistake, that reason being the necessity of His undergoing these sufferings. \"Whosoever,\" says He, \"will save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.\"[fn-60-P6099_1830638:801-nf] Surely[fn-61-P6100_1830665:802-nf] it is the Son of man[fn-61-P6101_1830700:803-nf] who uttered this sentence. Look carefully, then, along with the king of Babylon, into his burning fiery furnace, and there you will discover one \"like the Son of man\" (for He was not yet really Son of man, because not yet born of man), even as early as then[fn-61-P6102_1831007:804-nf] appointing issues such as these. He saved the lives of the three brethren,[fn-61-P6103_1831099:805-nf] who had agreed to lose them for God's sake; but He destroyed those of the Chaldµans, when they had preferred to save them by the means of their idolatry. Where is that novelty, which you pretend[fn-61-P6104_1831319:806-nf] in a doctrine which possesses these ancient proofs? But all the predictions have been fulfilled[fn-61-P6105_1831428:807-nf] concerning martyrdoms which were to happen, and were to receive the recompenses of their reward from God. \"See,\" says Isaiah, \"how the righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and just men are taken away, and no man considereth.\"[fn-61-P6106_1831692:808-nf] When does this more frequently happen than in the persecution of His saints? This, indeed, is no ordinary matter,[fn-61-P6107_1831827:809-nf] no common casualty of the law of nature; but it is that illustrious devotion, that fighting for the faith, wherein whosoever loses his life for God saves it, so that you may here again recognize the Judge who recompenses the evil gain of life with its destruction, and the good loss thereof with its salvation. It is, however, a jealous God whom He here presents to me one who returns evil for evil. \"For whosoever,\" says He, \"shall be ashamed of me, of him will I also be ashamed.\"[fn-61-P6108_1832497:810-nf] Now to none but my Christ can be assigned the occasion[fn-61-P6109_1832572:811-nf] of such a shame as this. His whole course[fn-61-P6110_1832640:812-nf] was so exposed to shame as to open a way for even the taunts of heretics, declaiming[fn-61-P6111_1832738:813-nf] with all the bitterness in their power against the utter disgrace[fn-61-P6112_1832825:814-nf] of His birth and bringing-up, and the unworthiness of His very flesh.[fn-61-P6113_1832914:815-nf] But how can that Christ of yours be liable to a shame, which it is impossible for him to experience? Since he was never condensed[fn-61-P6114_1833511:816-nf] into human flesh in the womb of a woman, although a virgin; never grew from human seed, although only after the law of corporeal substance, from the fluids[fn-61-P6115_1833699:817-nf] of a woman; was never deemed flesh before shaped in the womb; never called f£tus[fn-61-P6116_1833806:818-nf] after such shaping; was never delivered from a ten months' writhing in the womb;[fn-61-P6117_1834077:819-nf] was never shed forth upon the ground, amidst the sudden pains of parturition, with the unclean issue which flows at such a time through the sewerage of the body, forthwith to inaugurate the light[fn-61-P6118_1834725:820-nf] of life with tears, and with that primal wound which severs the child from her who bears him;[fn-61-P6119_1834860:821-nf] never received the copious ablution, nor the meditation of salt and honey;[fn-61-P6120_1835064:822-nf] nor did he initiate a shroud with swaddling clothes;[fn-61-P6121_1835306:823-nf] nor afterwards did he ever wallow[fn-61-P6122_1835395:824-nf] in his own uncleanness, in his mother's lap; nibbling at her breast; long an infant; gradually[fn-61-P6123_1835524:825-nf] a boy; by slow degrees[fn-61-P6124_1835559:826-nf] a man.[fn-61-P6125_1835580:827-nf] But he was revealed[fn-61-P6126_1835618:828-nf] from heaven, full-grown at once, at once complete; immediately Christ; simply spirit, and power, and god. But as withal he was not true, because not visible; therefore he was no object to be ashamed of from the curse of the cross, the real endurance[fn-61-P6127_1835924:829-nf] of which he escaped, because wanting in bodily substance. Never, therefore, could he have said, \"Whosoever shall be ashamed of me.\" But as for our Christ, He could do no otherwise than make such a declaration;[fn-61-P6128_1836151:830-nf] \"made\" by the Father \"a little lower than the angels,\"[fn-61-P6129_1836234:831-nf] \"a worm and no man, a reproach of men, and despised of the people; \"[fn-61-P6130_1836323:832-nf] seeing that it was His will that \"with His stripes we should be healed,\"[fn-61-P6131_1836416:833-nf] that by His humiliation our salvation should be established. And justly did He humble Himself[fn-61-P6132_1836531:834-nf] for His own creature man, for the image and likeness of Himself, and not of another, in order that man, since he had not felt ashamed when bowing down to a stone or a stock, might with similar courage give satisfaction to God for the shamelessness of his idolatry, by displaying an equal degree of shamelessness in his faith, in not being ashamed of Christ. Now, Marcion, which of these courses is better suited to your Christ, in respect of a meritorious shame?[fn-61-P6133_1837014:835-nf] Plainly, you ought yourself to blush with shame for having given him a fictitious existence.[fn-61-P6134_1837138:836-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":9,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":23,"source_paragraph":"91","folder":"ANF-03","text":"He sends forth His disciples to preach the kingdom of God.[fn-60-P6073_1825470:775-nf] Does He here say of what God?

Who would have given such a commandment as this, but He who feeds the ravens and clothes[fn-60-P6074_1825696:776-nf] the flowers of the field?

But when He charges them to shake off the dust of their feet against such as should refuse to receive them, He also bids that this be done as a witness.

Again, that it was no new god which recommended[fn-60-P6078_1826477:780-nf] by Christ, was dearly attested by the opinion of all men, because some maintained to Herod that Jesus was the Christ; others, that He was John; some, that He was Elias; and others, that He was one of the old prophetess.[fn-60-P6079_1826714:781-nf] Now, whosoever of all these He might have been, He certainly was not raised up for the purpose of announcing another god after His resurrection.

However, such was the greatness of His miracle, that He willed the slender supply of food, not only to be enough, but even to prove superabundant;[fn-60-P6085_1827537:787-nf] and herein He followed the ancient precedent. For in like manner, during the famine in Elijah's time, the scanty and final meal of the widow of Sarepta was multiplied[fn-60-P6086_1827722:788-nf] by the blessing of the prophet throughout the period of the famine.

Look carefully, then, along with the king of Babylon, into his burning fiery furnace, and there you will discover one \"like the Son of man\" (for He was not yet really Son of man, because not yet born of man), even as early as then[fn-61-P6102_1831007:804-nf] appointing issues such as these. He saved the lives of the three brethren,[fn-61-P6103_1831099:805-nf] who had agreed to lose them for God's sake; but He destroyed those of the Chaldµans, when they had preferred to save them by the means of their idolatry. Where is that novelty, which you pretend[fn-61-P6104_1831319:806-nf] in a doctrine which possesses these ancient proofs? But all the predictions have been fulfilled[fn-61-P6105_1831428:807-nf] concerning martyrdoms which were to happen, and were to receive the recompenses of their reward from God. \"See,\" says Isaiah, \"how the righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and just men are taken away, and no man considereth.\"[fn-61-P6106_1831692:808-nf] When does this more frequently happen than in the persecution of His saints? This, indeed, is no ordinary matter,[fn-61-P6107_1831827:809-nf] no common casualty of the law of nature; but it is that illustrious devotion, that fighting for the faith, wherein whosoever loses his life for God saves it, so that you may here again recognize the Judge who recompenses the evil gain of life with its destruction, and the good loss thereof with its salvation. It is, however, a jealous God whom He here presents to me one who returns evil for evil. \"For whosoever,\" says He, \"shall be ashamed of me, of him will I also be ashamed.\"[fn-61-P6108_1832497:810-nf] Now to none but my Christ can be assigned the occasion[fn-61-P6109_1832572:811-nf] of such a shame as this. His whole course[fn-61-P6110_1832640:812-nf] was so exposed to shame as to open a way for even the taunts of heretics, declaiming[fn-61-P6111_1832738:813-nf] with all the bitterness in their power against the utter disgrace[fn-61-P6112_1832825:814-nf] of His birth and bringing-up, and the unworthiness of His very flesh.[fn-61-P6113_1832914:815-nf] But how can that Christ of yours be liable to a shame, which it is impossible for him to experience? Since he was never condensed[fn-61-P6114_1833511:816-nf] into human flesh in the womb of a woman, although a virgin; never grew from human seed, although only after the law of corporeal substance, from the fluids[fn-61-P6115_1833699:817-nf] of a woman; was never deemed flesh before shaped in the womb; never called f£tus[fn-61-P6116_1833806:818-nf] after such shaping; was never delivered from a ten months' writhing in the womb;[fn-61-P6117_1834077:819-nf] was never shed forth upon the ground, amidst the sudden pains of parturition, with the unclean issue which flows at such a time through the sewerage of the body, forthwith to inaugurate the light[fn-61-P6118_1834725:820-nf] of life with tears, and with that primal wound which severs the child from her who bears him;[fn-61-P6119_1834860:821-nf] never received the copious ablution, nor the meditation of salt and honey;[fn-61-P6120_1835064:822-nf] nor did he initiate a shroud with swaddling clothes;[fn-61-P6121_1835306:823-nf] nor afterwards did he ever wallow[fn-61-P6122_1835395:824-nf] in his own uncleanness, in his mother's lap; nibbling at her breast; long an infant; gradually[fn-61-P6123_1835524:825-nf] a boy; by slow degrees[fn-61-P6124_1835559:826-nf] a man.[fn-61-P6125_1835580:827-nf] But he was revealed[fn-61-P6126_1835618:828-nf] from heaven, full-grown at once, at once complete; immediately Christ; simply spirit, and power, and god. But as withal he was not true, because not visible; therefore he was no object to be ashamed of from the curse of the cross, the real endurance[fn-61-P6127_1835924:829-nf] of which he escaped, because wanting in bodily substance. Never, therefore, could he have said, \"Whosoever shall be ashamed of me.\" But as for our Christ, He could do no otherwise than make such a declaration;[fn-61-P6128_1836151:830-nf] \"made\" by the Father \"a little lower than the angels,\"[fn-61-P6129_1836234:831-nf] \"a worm and no man, a reproach of men, and despised of the people; \"[fn-61-P6130_1836323:832-nf] seeing that it was His will that \"with His stripes we should be healed,\"[fn-61-P6131_1836416:833-nf] that by His humiliation our salvation should be established. And justly did He humble Himself[fn-61-P6132_1836531:834-nf] for His own creature man, for the image and likeness of Himself, and not of another, in order that man, since he had not felt ashamed when bowing down to a stone or a stock, might with similar courage give satisfaction to God for the shamelessness of his idolatry, by displaying an equal degree of shamelessness in his faith, in not being ashamed of Christ. Now, Marcion, which of these courses is better suited to your Christ, in respect of a meritorious shame?[fn-61-P6133_1837014:835-nf] Plainly, you ought yourself to blush with shame for having given him a fictitious existence.[fn-61-P6134_1837138:836-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":9,"verse":22,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":23,"source_paragraph":"91","folder":"ANF-03","text":"He sends forth His disciples to preach the kingdom of God.[fn-60-P6073_1825470:775-nf] Does He here say of what God?

However, such was the greatness of His miracle, that He willed the slender supply of food, not only to be enough, but even to prove superabundant;[fn-60-P6085_1827537:787-nf] and herein He followed the ancient precedent. For in like manner, during the famine in Elijah's time, the scanty and final meal of the widow of Sarepta was multiplied[fn-60-P6086_1827722:788-nf] by the blessing of the prophet throughout the period of the famine.

His whole course[fn-61-P6110_1832640:812-nf] was so exposed to shame as to open a way for even the taunts of heretics, declaiming[fn-61-P6111_1832738:813-nf] with all the bitterness in their power against the utter disgrace[fn-61-P6112_1832825:814-nf] of His birth and bringing-up, and the unworthiness of His very flesh.[fn-61-P6113_1832914:815-nf] But how can that Christ of yours be liable to a shame, which it is impossible for him to experience? Since he was never condensed[fn-61-P6114_1833511:816-nf] into human flesh in the womb of a woman, although a virgin; never grew from human seed, although only after the law of corporeal substance, from the fluids[fn-61-P6115_1833699:817-nf] of a woman; was never deemed flesh before shaped in the womb; never called f£tus[fn-61-P6116_1833806:818-nf] after such shaping; was never delivered from a ten months' writhing in the womb;[fn-61-P6117_1834077:819-nf] was never shed forth upon the ground, amidst the sudden pains of parturition, with the unclean issue which flows at such a time through the sewerage of the body, forthwith to inaugurate the light[fn-61-P6118_1834725:820-nf] of life with tears, and with that primal wound which severs the child from her who bears him;[fn-61-P6119_1834860:821-nf] never received the copious ablution, nor the meditation of salt and honey;[fn-61-P6120_1835064:822-nf] nor did he initiate a shroud with swaddling clothes;[fn-61-P6121_1835306:823-nf] nor afterwards did he ever wallow[fn-61-P6122_1835395:824-nf] in his own uncleanness, in his mother's lap; nibbling at her breast; long an infant; gradually[fn-61-P6123_1835524:825-nf] a boy; by slow degrees[fn-61-P6124_1835559:826-nf] a man.[fn-61-P6125_1835580:827-nf] But he was revealed[fn-61-P6126_1835618:828-nf] from heaven, full-grown at once, at once complete; immediately Christ; simply spirit, and power, and god. But as withal he was not true, because not visible; therefore he was no object to be ashamed of from the curse of the cross, the real endurance[fn-61-P6127_1835924:829-nf] of which he escaped, because wanting in bodily substance. Never, therefore, could he have said, \"Whosoever shall be ashamed of me.\" But as for our Christ, He could do no otherwise than make such a declaration;[fn-61-P6128_1836151:830-nf] \"made\" by the Father \"a little lower than the angels,\"[fn-61-P6129_1836234:831-nf] \"a worm and no man, a reproach of men, and despised of the people; \"[fn-61-P6130_1836323:832-nf] seeing that it was His will that \"with His stripes we should be healed,\"[fn-61-P6131_1836416:833-nf] that by His humiliation our salvation should be established. And justly did He humble Himself[fn-61-P6132_1836531:834-nf] for His own creature man, for the image and likeness of Himself, and not of another, in order that man, since he had not felt ashamed when bowing down to a stone or a stock, might with similar courage give satisfaction to God for the shamelessness of his idolatry, by displaying an equal degree of shamelessness in his faith, in not being ashamed of Christ. Now, Marcion, which of these courses is better suited to your Christ, in respect of a meritorious shame?[fn-61-P6133_1837014:835-nf] Plainly, you ought yourself to blush with shame for having given him a fictitious existence.[fn-61-P6134_1837138:836-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":9,"verse":26,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":23,"source_paragraph":"91","folder":"ANF-03","text":"He sends forth His disciples to preach the kingdom of God.[fn-60-P6073_1825470:775-nf] Does He here say of what God? He forbids their taking anything for their journey, by way of either food or raiment. Who would have given such a commandment as this, but He who feeds the ravens and clothes[fn-60-P6074_1825696:776-nf] the flowers of the field? Who anciently enjoined for the treading ox an unmuzzled mouth,[fn-60-P6075_1825800:777-nf] that he might be at liberty to gather his fodder from his labour, on the principle that the worker is worthy of his hire?[fn-60-P6076_1825946:778-nf] Marcion may expunge such precepts, but no matter, provided the sense of them survives. But when He charges them to shake off the dust of their feet against such as should refuse to receive them, He also bids that this be done as a witness. Now no one bears witness except in a case which is decided by judicial process; and whoever orders inhuman conduct to be submitted to the trial by testimony,[fn-60-P6077_1826366:779-nf] does really threaten as a judge. Again, that it was no new god which recommended[fn-60-P6078_1826477:780-nf] by Christ, was dearly attested by the opinion of all men, because some maintained to Herod that Jesus was the Christ; others, that He was John; some, that He was Elias; and others, that He was one of the old prophetess.[fn-60-P6079_1826714:781-nf] Now, whosoever of all these He might have been, He certainly was not raised up for the purpose of announcing another god after His resurrection. He feeds the multitude in the desert place;[fn-60-P6080_1826925:782-nf] this, you must know[fn-60-P6081_1826968:783-nf] was after the manner of the Old Testament.[fn-60-P6082_1827028:784-nf] Or else,[fn-60-P6083_1827062:785-nf] if there was not the same grandeur, it follows that He is now inferior to the Creator. For He, not for one day, but during forty years, not on the inferior aliment of bread and fish, but with the manna of heaven, supported the lives[fn-60-P6084_1827307:786-nf] of not five thousand, but of six hundred thousand human beings. However, such was the greatness of His miracle, that He willed the slender supply of food, not only to be enough, but even to prove superabundant;[fn-60-P6085_1827537:787-nf] and herein He followed the ancient precedent. For in like manner, during the famine in Elijah's time, the scanty and final meal of the widow of Sarepta was multiplied[fn-60-P6086_1827722:788-nf] by the blessing of the prophet throughout the period of the famine. You have the third book of the Kings.[fn-60-P6087_1827850:789-nf] If you also turn to the fourth book, you will discover all this conduct[fn-60-P6088_1827949:790-nf] of Christ pursued by that man of God, who ordered ten[fn-60-P6089_1828019:791-nf] barley loaves which had been given him to be distributed among the people; and when his servitor, after contrasting the large number of the persons with the small supply of the food, answered, \"What, shall I set this before a hundred men? \"he said again, \"Give them, and they shall eat: for thus saith the Lord, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof, according to the word of the Lord.\"[fn-60-P6090_1828600:792-nf] O Christ, even in Thy novelties Thou art old! Accordingly, when Peter, who had been an eye-witness of the miracle, and had compared it with the ancient precedents, and had discovered in them prophetic intimations of what should one day come to pass, answered (as the mouthpiece of them all) the Lord's inquiry, \"Whom say ye that I am? \"[fn-60-P6091_1828963:793-nf] in the words, \"Thou art the Christ,\" he could not but have perceived that He was that Christ, beside whom he knew of none else in the Scriptures, and whom he was now surveying[fn-60-P6092_1829159:794-nf] in His wonderful deeds. This conclusion He even Himself confirms by thus far bearing with it, nay, even enjoining silence respecting it.[fn-60-P6093_1829315:795-nf] For if Peter was unable to acknowledge Him to be any other than the Creator's Christ, while He commanded them \"to tell no man that saying,\" surely[fn-60-P6094_1829482:796-nf] He was unwilling to have the conclusion promulged which Peter had drawn. No doubt of that,[fn-60-P6095_1829588:797-nf] you say; but as Peter's conclusion was a wrong one, therefore He was unwilling to have a lie disseminated. It was, however, a different reason which He assigned for the silence, even because \"the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and scribes, and priests, and be slain, and be raised again the third day.\"[fn-60-P6096_1829940:798-nf] Now, inasmuch as these sufferings were actually foretold for the Creator's Christ (as we shall fully show in the proper place[fn-60-P6097_1830086:799-nf] ), so by this application of them to His own case[fn-60-P6098_1830172:800-nf] does He prove that it is He Himself of whom they were predicted. At all events, even if they had not been predicted, the reason which He alleged for imposing silence (on the disciples) was such as made it clear enough that Peter had made no mistake, that reason being the necessity of His undergoing these sufferings. \"Whosoever,\" says He, \"will save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.\"[fn-60-P6099_1830638:801-nf] Surely[fn-61-P6100_1830665:802-nf] it is the Son of man[fn-61-P6101_1830700:803-nf] who uttered this sentence. Look carefully, then, along with the king of Babylon, into his burning fiery furnace, and there you will discover one \"like the Son of man\" (for He was not yet really Son of man, because not yet born of man), even as early as then[fn-61-P6102_1831007:804-nf] appointing issues such as these. He saved the lives of the three brethren,[fn-61-P6103_1831099:805-nf] who had agreed to lose them for God's sake; but He destroyed those of the Chaldµans, when they had preferred to save them by the means of their idolatry. Where is that novelty, which you pretend[fn-61-P6104_1831319:806-nf] in a doctrine which possesses these ancient proofs? But all the predictions have been fulfilled[fn-61-P6105_1831428:807-nf] concerning martyrdoms which were to happen, and were to receive the recompenses of their reward from God. \"See,\" says Isaiah, \"how the righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and just men are taken away, and no man considereth.\"[fn-61-P6106_1831692:808-nf] When does this more frequently happen than in the persecution of His saints? This, indeed, is no ordinary matter,[fn-61-P6107_1831827:809-nf] no common casualty of the law of nature; but it is that illustrious devotion, that fighting for the faith, wherein whosoever loses his life for God saves it, so that you may here again recognize the Judge who recompenses the evil gain of life with its destruction, and the good loss thereof with its salvation. It is, however, a jealous God whom He here presents to me one who returns evil for evil. \"For whosoever,\" says He, \"shall be ashamed of me, of him will I also be ashamed.\"[fn-61-P6108_1832497:810-nf] Now to none but my Christ can be assigned the occasion[fn-61-P6109_1832572:811-nf] of such a shame as this. His whole course[fn-61-P6110_1832640:812-nf] was so exposed to shame as to open a way for even the taunts of heretics, declaiming[fn-61-P6111_1832738:813-nf] with all the bitterness in their power against the utter disgrace[fn-61-P6112_1832825:814-nf] of His birth and bringing-up, and the unworthiness of His very flesh.[fn-61-P6113_1832914:815-nf] But how can that Christ of yours be liable to a shame, which it is impossible for him to experience?

Never, therefore, could he have said, \"Whosoever shall be ashamed of me.\" But as for our Christ, He could do no otherwise than make such a declaration;[fn-61-P6128_1836151:830-nf] \"made\" by the Father \"a little lower than the angels,\"[fn-61-P6129_1836234:831-nf] \"a worm and no man, a reproach of men, and despised of the people; \"[fn-61-P6130_1836323:832-nf] seeing that it was His will that \"with His stripes we should be healed,\"[fn-61-P6131_1836416:833-nf] that by His humiliation our salvation should be established.

This, to be sure,[fn-61-P6139_1837638:838-nf] was what he wished to be understood as the meaning of that voice from heaven: \"This is my beloved Son, hear Him\"[fn-61-P6140_1837814:839-nf] -Him, that is, not Moses or Elias any longer. The voice alone, therefore, was enough, without the display of Moses and Elias; for, by expressly mentioning whom they were to hear, he must have forbidden all[fn-61-P6141_1838040:840-nf] others from being heard. Or else, did he mean that Isaiah and Jeremiah and the others whom he did not exhibit were to be heard, since he prohibited those whom he did display? Now, even if their presence was necessary, they surely should not be represented as conversing together, which is a sign of familiarity; nor as associated in glory with him, for this indicates respect and graciousness; but they should be shown in some slough[fn-61-P6142_1838493:841-nf] as a sure token of their ruin, or even in that darkness of the Creator which Christ was sent to disperse, far removed from the glory of Him who was about to sever their words and writings from His gospel. This, then, is the way[fn-61-P6143_1838751:842-nf] how he demonstrates them to be aliens,[fn-61-P6144_1838802:843-nf] even by keeping them in his own company! This is how he shows they ought to be relinquished: he associates them with himself instead! This is how he destroys them: he irradiates them with his glory! How would their own Christ act? I suppose He would have imitated the frowardness (of heresy),[fn-61-P6145_1839128:844-nf] and revealed them just as Marcion's Christ was bound to do, or at least as having with Him any others rather than His own prophets! But what could so well befit the Creator's Christ, as to manifest Him in the company of His own foreannouncers?[fn-61-P6146_1839403:845-nf] -to let Him be seen with those to whom He had appeared in revelations?-to let Him be speaking with those who had spoken of Him?-to share His glory with those by whom He used to be called the Lord of glory; even with those chief servants of His, one of whom was once the moulder[fn-61-P6147_1839703:846-nf] of His people, the other afterwards the reformer[fn-61-P6148_1839810:847-nf] thereof; one the initiator of the Old Testament, the other the consummator[fn-61-P6149_1839930:848-nf] of the New? Well therefore does Peter, when recognizing the companions of his Christ in their indissoluble connection with Him, suggest an expedient: \"It is good for us to be here\" (good: that evidently means to be where Moses and Elias are); \"and let us make three tabernacles, one for Thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. But he knew not what he said.\"[fn-61-P6150_1840483:849-nf] How knew not? Was his ignorance the result of simple error? Or was it on the principle which we maintain[fn-61-P6151_1840608:850-nf] in the cause of the new prophecy,[fn-61-P6152_1840959:851-nf] that to grace ecstasy or rapture[fn-61-P6153_1841018:852-nf] is incident. For when a man is rapt in the Spirit, especially when he beholds the glory of God, or when God speaks through him, he necessarily loses his sensation,[fn-61-P6154_1841199:853-nf] because he is overshadowed with the power of God,-a point concerning which there is a question between us and the carnally-minded.[fn-61-P6155_1841352:854-nf] Now, it is no difficult matter to prove the rapture[fn-61-P6156_1842177:855-nf] of Peter. For how could he have known Moses and Elias, except (by being) in the Spirit? People could not have had their images, or statues, or likenesses; for that the law forbade. How, if it were not that he had seen them in the Spirit? And therefore, because it was in the Spirit that he had now spoken, and not in his natural senses, he could not know what he had said. But if, on the other hand,[fn-61-P6157_1842594:856-nf] he was thus ignorant, because he erroneously supposed that (Jesus) was their Christ, it is then evident that Peter, when previously asked by Christ, \"Whom they thought Him to be,\" meant the Creator's Christ, when he answered, \"Thou art the Christ; \"because if he had been then aware that He belonged to the rival god, he would not have made a mistake here. But if he was in error here because of his previous erroneous opinion,[fn-61-P6158_1843038:857-nf] then you may be sure that up to that very day no new divinity had been revealed by Christ, and that Peter had so far made no mistake, because hitherto Christ had revealed nothing of the kind; and that Christ accordingly was not to be regarded as belonging to any other than the Creator, whose entire dispensation[fn-61-P6159_1843388:858-nf] he, in fact, here described. He selects from His disciples three witnesses of the impending vision and voice. And this is just the way of the Creator. \"In the mouth of three witnesses,\" says He, \"shall every word be established.\"[fn-61-P6160_1843707:859-nf] He withdraws to a mountain. In the nature of the place I see much meaning. For the Creator had originally formed His ancient people on a mountain both with visible glory and His voice. It was only tight that the New Testament should be attested[fn-61-P6161_1843999:860-nf] on such an elevated spot[fn-61-P6162_1844043:861-nf] as that whereon the Old Testament had been composed;[fn-61-P6163_1844119:862-nf] under a like covering of cloud also, which nobody will doubt, was condensed out of the Creator's air. Unless, indeed, he[fn-61-P6164_1844267:863-nf] had brought down his own clouds thither, because he had himself forced his way through the Creator's heaven;[fn-61-P6165_1844398:864-nf] or else it was only a precarious cloud,[fn-61-P6166_1844500:865-nf] as it were, of the Creator which he used. On the present (as also on the former)[fn-61-P6167_1844705:866-nf] occasion, therefore, the cloud was not silent; but there was the accustomed voice from heaven, and the Father's testimony to the Son; precisely as in the first Psalm He had said, \"Thou art my Son, today have I begotten thee.\"[fn-61-P6168_1844948:867-nf] By the mouth of Isaiah also He had asked concerning Him, \"Who is there among you that feareth God? Let him hear the voice of His Son.\"[fn-61-P6169_1845101:868-nf] When therefore He here presents Him with the words, \"This is my (beloved) Son,\" this clause is of course understood, \"whom I have promised.\" For if He once promised, and then afterwards says, \"This is He,\" it is suitable conduct for one who accomplishes His purpose[fn-61-P6170_1845415:869-nf] that He should utter His voice in proof of the promise which He had formerly made; but unsuitable in one who is amenable to the retort, Can you, indeed, have a right to say, \"This is my son,\" concerning whom you have given us no previous information,[fn-61-P6171_1845694:870-nf] any more than you have favoured us with a revelation about your own prior existence? \"Hear ye Him,\" therefore, whom from the beginning (the Creator) had declared entitled to be heard in the name of a prophet, since it was as a prophet that He had to be regarded by the people. \"A prophet,\" says Moses, \"shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, of your sons\" (that is, of course, after a carnal descent[fn-61-P6172_1846178:871-nf] ); \"unto Him shall ye hearken, as unto me.\"[fn-61-P6173_1846264:872-nf] \"Every one who will not hearken unto Him, his soul[fn-61-P6174_1846339:873-nf] shall be cut off from amongst his people.\"[fn-61-P6175_1846402:874-nf] , So also Isaiah: \"Who is there among you that feareth God? Let him hear the voice of His Son.\"[fn-61-P6176_1846522:875-nf] This voice the Father was going Himself to recommend. For, says he,[fn-61-P6177_1846609:876-nf] He establishes the words of His Son, when He says, \"This is my beloved Son, hear ye Him.\" Therefore, even if there be made a transfer of the obedient \"heating\" from Moses and Elias to[fn-61-P6178_1847561:877-nf] Christ, it is still not from[fn-61-P6179_1847684:878-nf] another God, or to another Christ; but from\" the Creator to His Christ, in consequence of the departure of the old covenant and the supervening of the new. \"Not an ambassador, nor an angel, but He Himself,\" says Isaiah, \"shall save them; \"[fn-61-P6180_1847960:879-nf] for it is He Himself who is now declaring and fulfilling the law and the prophets.

For when a man is rapt in the Spirit, especially when he beholds the glory of God, or when God speaks through him, he necessarily loses his sensation,[fn-61-P6154_1841199:853-nf] because he is overshadowed with the power of God,-a point concerning which there is a question between us and the carnally-minded.[fn-61-P6155_1841352:854-nf] Now, it is no difficult matter to prove the rapture[fn-61-P6156_1842177:855-nf] of Peter. For how could he have known Moses and Elias, except (by being) in the Spirit? People could not have had their images, or statues, or likenesses; for that the law forbade. How, if it were not that he had seen them in the Spirit? And therefore, because it was in the Spirit that he had now spoken, and not in his natural senses, he could not know what he had said. But if, on the other hand,[fn-61-P6157_1842594:856-nf] he was thus ignorant, because he erroneously supposed that (Jesus) was their Christ, it is then evident that Peter, when previously asked by Christ, \"Whom they thought Him to be,\" meant the Creator's Christ, when he answered, \"Thou art the Christ; \"because if he had been then aware that He belonged to the rival god, he would not have made a mistake here.

But we have the entire structure[fn-61-P6182_1848541:881-nf] of this same vision in Habakkuk also, where the Spirit in the person of some[fn-61-P6183_1848634:882-nf] of the apostles says, \"O Lord, I have heard Thy speech, and was afraid.\" What speech was this, other than the words of the voice from heaven, This is my beloved Son, hear ye, Him? \"I considered thy works, and was astonished.\" When could this have better happened than when Peter, on seeing His glory, knew not what he was saying? \"In the midst of the two Thou shalt be known\"-even Moses and Elias.[fn-61-P6184_1849050:883-nf] These likewise did Zechariah see under the figure of the two olive trees and olive branches.[fn-61-P6185_1849261:884-nf] For these are they of whom he says, \"They are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.\" And again Habakkuk says, \"His glory covered the heavens\" (that is, with that cloud), \"and His splendour shall be like the light-even the light, wherewith His very raiment glistened.\" And if we would make mention of[fn-61-P6186_1849613:885-nf] the promise to Moses, we shall find it accomplished here. For when Moses desired to see the Lord, saying, \"If therefore I have found grace in Thy sight, manifest Thyself to me, that I may see Thee distinctly,\"[fn-61-P6187_1849874:886-nf] the sight which he desired to have was of that condition which he was to assume as man, and which as a prophet he knew was to occur. Respecting the face of God, however, he had already heard, \"No man shall see me, and live.\" \"This thing,\" said He, \"which thou hast spoken, will I do unto thee.\" Then Moses said, \"Show me Thy glory.\" And the Lord, with like reference to the future, replied, \"I will pass before thee in my glory,\" etc. Then at the last He says, \"And then thou shall see my back.\"[fn-61-P6188_1850423:887-nf] Not loins, or calves of the legs, did he want to behold, but the glory which was to be revealed in the latter days.[fn-61-P6189_1850569:888-nf] He had promised that He would make Himself thus face to face visible to him, when He said to Aaron, \"If there shall be a prophet among you, I will make myself known to him by vision, and by vision will I speak with him; but not so is my manner to Moses; with him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently\" (that is to say, in the form of man which He was to assume), \"and not in dark speeches.\"[fn-61-P6190_1851193:889-nf] Now, although Marcion has denied[fn-61-P6191_1851248:890-nf] that he is here represented as speaking with the Lord, but only as standing, yet, inasmuch as he stood \"mouth to mouth,\" he must also have stood \"face to face\" with him, to use his words,[fn-61-P6192_1851451:891-nf] not far from him, in His very glory-not to say,[fn-61-P6193_1851553:892-nf] in His presence. And with this glory he went away enlightened from Christ, just as he used to do from the Creator; as then to dazzle the eyes of the children of Israel, so now to smite those of the blinded Marcion, who has failed to see how this argument also makes against him.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":9,"verse":28,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"93","folder":"ANF-03","text":"You ought to be very much ashamed of yourself on this account too, for permitting him to appear on the retired mountain in the company of Moses and Elias,[fn-61-P6138_1837568:837-nf] whom he had come to destroy. This, to be sure,[fn-61-P6139_1837638:838-nf] was what he wished to be understood as the meaning of that voice from heaven: \"This is my beloved Son, hear Him\"[fn-61-P6140_1837814:839-nf] -Him, that is, not Moses or Elias any longer. The voice alone, therefore, was enough, without the display of Moses and Elias; for, by expressly mentioning whom they were to hear, he must have forbidden all[fn-61-P6141_1838040:840-nf] others from being heard. Or else, did he mean that Isaiah and Jeremiah and the others whom he did not exhibit were to be heard, since he prohibited those whom he did display? Now, even if their presence was necessary, they surely should not be represented as conversing together, which is a sign of familiarity; nor as associated in glory with him, for this indicates respect and graciousness; but they should be shown in some slough[fn-61-P6142_1838493:841-nf] as a sure token of their ruin, or even in that darkness of the Creator which Christ was sent to disperse, far removed from the glory of Him who was about to sever their words and writings from His gospel. This, then, is the way[fn-61-P6143_1838751:842-nf] how he demonstrates them to be aliens,[fn-61-P6144_1838802:843-nf] even by keeping them in his own company! This is how he shows they ought to be relinquished: he associates them with himself instead! This is how he destroys them: he irradiates them with his glory! How would their own Christ act? I suppose He would have imitated the frowardness (of heresy),[fn-61-P6145_1839128:844-nf] and revealed them just as Marcion's Christ was bound to do, or at least as having with Him any others rather than His own prophets! But what could so well befit the Creator's Christ, as to manifest Him in the company of His own foreannouncers?[fn-61-P6146_1839403:845-nf] -to let Him be seen with those to whom He had appeared in revelations?-to let Him be speaking with those who had spoken of Him?-to share His glory with those by whom He used to be called the Lord of glory; even with those chief servants of His, one of whom was once the moulder[fn-61-P6147_1839703:846-nf] of His people, the other afterwards the reformer[fn-61-P6148_1839810:847-nf] thereof; one the initiator of the Old Testament, the other the consummator[fn-61-P6149_1839930:848-nf] of the New? Well therefore does Peter, when recognizing the companions of his Christ in their indissoluble connection with Him, suggest an expedient: \"It is good for us to be here\" (good: that evidently means to be where Moses and Elias are); \"and let us make three tabernacles, one for Thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. But he knew not what he said.\"[fn-61-P6150_1840483:849-nf] How knew not? Was his ignorance the result of simple error? Or was it on the principle which we maintain[fn-61-P6151_1840608:850-nf] in the cause of the new prophecy,[fn-61-P6152_1840959:851-nf] that to grace ecstasy or rapture[fn-61-P6153_1841018:852-nf] is incident. For when a man is rapt in the Spirit, especially when he beholds the glory of God, or when God speaks through him, he necessarily loses his sensation,[fn-61-P6154_1841199:853-nf] because he is overshadowed with the power of God,-a point concerning which there is a question between us and the carnally-minded.[fn-61-P6155_1841352:854-nf] Now, it is no difficult matter to prove the rapture[fn-61-P6156_1842177:855-nf] of Peter. For how could he have known Moses and Elias, except (by being) in the Spirit? People could not have had their images, or statues, or likenesses; for that the law forbade. How, if it were not that he had seen them in the Spirit? And therefore, because it was in the Spirit that he had now spoken, and not in his natural senses, he could not know what he had said. But if, on the other hand,[fn-61-P6157_1842594:856-nf] he was thus ignorant, because he erroneously supposed that (Jesus) was their Christ, it is then evident that Peter, when previously asked by Christ, \"Whom they thought Him to be,\" meant the Creator's Christ, when he answered, \"Thou art the Christ; \"because if he had been then aware that He belonged to the rival god, he would not have made a mistake here. But if he was in error here because of his previous erroneous opinion,[fn-61-P6158_1843038:857-nf] then you may be sure that up to that very day no new divinity had been revealed by Christ, and that Peter had so far made no mistake, because hitherto Christ had revealed nothing of the kind; and that Christ accordingly was not to be regarded as belonging to any other than the Creator, whose entire dispensation[fn-61-P6159_1843388:858-nf] he, in fact, here described. He selects from His disciples three witnesses of the impending vision and voice. And this is just the way of the Creator. \"In the mouth of three witnesses,\" says He, \"shall every word be established.\"[fn-61-P6160_1843707:859-nf] He withdraws to a mountain. In the nature of the place I see much meaning. For the Creator had originally formed His ancient people on a mountain both with visible glory and His voice. It was only tight that the New Testament should be attested[fn-61-P6161_1843999:860-nf] on such an elevated spot[fn-61-P6162_1844043:861-nf] as that whereon the Old Testament had been composed;[fn-61-P6163_1844119:862-nf] under a like covering of cloud also, which nobody will doubt, was condensed out of the Creator's air. Unless, indeed, he[fn-61-P6164_1844267:863-nf] had brought down his own clouds thither, because he had himself forced his way through the Creator's heaven;[fn-61-P6165_1844398:864-nf] or else it was only a precarious cloud,[fn-61-P6166_1844500:865-nf] as it were, of the Creator which he used. On the present (as also on the former)[fn-61-P6167_1844705:866-nf] occasion, therefore, the cloud was not silent; but there was the accustomed voice from heaven, and the Father's testimony to the Son; precisely as in the first Psalm He had said, \"Thou art my Son, today have I begotten thee.\"[fn-61-P6168_1844948:867-nf] By the mouth of Isaiah also He had asked concerning Him, \"Who is there among you that feareth God? Let him hear the voice of His Son.\"[fn-61-P6169_1845101:868-nf] When therefore He here presents Him with the words, \"This is my (beloved) Son,\" this clause is of course understood, \"whom I have promised.\" For if He once promised, and then afterwards says, \"This is He,\" it is suitable conduct for one who accomplishes His purpose[fn-61-P6170_1845415:869-nf] that He should utter His voice in proof of the promise which He had formerly made; but unsuitable in one who is amenable to the retort, Can you, indeed, have a right to say, \"This is my son,\" concerning whom you have given us no previous information,[fn-61-P6171_1845694:870-nf] any more than you have favoured us with a revelation about your own prior existence? \"Hear ye Him,\" therefore, whom from the beginning (the Creator) had declared entitled to be heard in the name of a prophet, since it was as a prophet that He had to be regarded by the people. \"A prophet,\" says Moses, \"shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, of your sons\" (that is, of course, after a carnal descent[fn-61-P6172_1846178:871-nf] ); \"unto Him shall ye hearken, as unto me.\"[fn-61-P6173_1846264:872-nf] \"Every one who will not hearken unto Him, his soul[fn-61-P6174_1846339:873-nf] shall be cut off from amongst his people.\"[fn-61-P6175_1846402:874-nf] , So also Isaiah: \"Who is there among you that feareth God? Let him hear the voice of His Son.\"[fn-61-P6176_1846522:875-nf] This voice the Father was going Himself to recommend. For, says he,[fn-61-P6177_1846609:876-nf] He establishes the words of His Son, when He says, \"This is my beloved Son, hear ye Him.\" Therefore, even if there be made a transfer of the obedient \"heating\" from Moses and Elias to[fn-61-P6178_1847561:877-nf] Christ, it is still not from[fn-61-P6179_1847684:878-nf] another God, or to another Christ; but from\" the Creator to His Christ, in consequence of the departure of the old covenant and the supervening of the new. \"Not an ambassador, nor an angel, but He Himself,\" says Isaiah, \"shall save them; \"[fn-61-P6180_1847960:879-nf] for it is He Himself who is now declaring and fulfilling the law and the prophets. The Father gave to the Son new disciples,[fn-61-P6181_1848177:880-nf] after that Moses and Elias had been exhibited along with Him in the honour of His glory, and had then been dismissed as having fully discharged their duty and office, for the express purpose of affirming for Marcion's information the fact that Moses and Elias had a share in even the glory of Christ.

How long since did you begin to plead with us, that you are charging us with delay? Wherein have you borne with us, that you should even boast of your patience? The ass has only just arrived from ¦sop's well, and he is already braying.\" Now who would not thus have rebutted the unfairness of the rebuke, if he had supposed its author to belong to him who had had no right as yet to complain? Except that not even He[fn-62-P6208_1854631:904-nf] would have inveighed against them, if He had not dwelt among them of old in the law and by the prophets, and with mighty deeds and many mercies, and had always experienced them to be \"faithless.\" But, behold, Christ takes[fn-62-P6209_1854930:905-nf] infants, and teaches how all ought to be like them, if they ever wish to be greater.[fn-62-P6210_1855041:906-nf] The Creator, on the contrary,[fn-62-P6211_1855095:907-nf] let loose bears against children, in order to avenge His prophet Elisha, who had been mocked by them.[fn-62-P6212_1855211:908-nf] This antithesis is impudent enough, since it throws together[fn-62-P6213_1855298:909-nf] things so different as infants[fn-62-P6214_1855347:910-nf] and children,[fn-62-P6215_1855378:911-nf] -an age still innocent, and one already capable of discretion-able to mock, if not to blaspheme. As therefore God is a just God, He spared not impious children, exacting as He does honour for every time of life, and especially, of course, from youth. And as God is good, He so loves infants as to have blessed the midwives in Egypt, when they protected the infants of the Hebrews[fn-62-P6216_1855787:912-nf] which were in peril from Pharaoh's command.[fn-62-P6217_1855855:913-nf] Christ therefore shares this kindness with the Creator. As indeed for Marcion's god, who is an enemy to marriage, how can he possibly seem to be a lover of little children, which are simply the issue of marriage? He who hates the seed must needs also detest the fruit. Yea, he ought to be deemed more ruthless than the king of Egypt.[fn-62-P6218_1856211:914-nf] For whereas Pharaoh forbade infants to be brought up, he will not allow them even to be born, depriving them of their ten months' existence in the womb. And how much more credible it is, that kindness to little children should be attributed to Him who blessed matrimony for the procreation of mankind, and in such benediction included also the promise of connubial fruit itself, the first of which is that of infancy![fn-62-P6219_1856689:915-nf] The Creator, at the request of Elias, inflicts the blow[fn-62-P6220_1856834:916-nf] of fire from heaven in the case of that false prophet (of Baalzebub).[fn-62-P6221_1856932:917-nf] I recognise herein the severity of the Judge. And I, on the contrary, the severe rebuke[fn-62-P6222_1857044:918-nf] of Christ on His disciples, when they were for inflicting[fn-62-P6223_1857475:919-nf] a like visitation on that obscure village of the Samaritans.[fn-62-P6224_1857556:920-nf] The heretic, too, may discover that this gentleness of Christ was promised by the selfsame severest Judge. \"He shall not contend,\" says He, \"nor shall His voice be heard in the street; a bruised reed shall He not crush, and smoking flax shall He not quench.\"[fn-62-P6225_1857838:921-nf] Being of such a character, He was of course much the less disposed to burn men. For even at that time the Lord said to Elias,[fn-62-P6226_1857987:922-nf] \"He was not in the fire, but in the still small voice.\"[fn-62-P6227_1858082:923-nf] Well, but why does this most humane and merciful God reject the man who offers himself to Him as an inseparable companion?[fn-62-P6228_1858229:924-nf] If it were from pride or from hypocrisy that he had said, \"I will follow Thee whithersoever Thou goest, ' then, by judicially reproving an act of either pride or hypocrisy as worthy of rejection, He performed the office of a Judge. And, of course, him whom He rejected He condemned to the loss of not following the Saviour.[fn-62-P6229_1858577:925-nf] For as He calls to salvation him whom He does not reject, or him whom He voluntarily invites, so does He consign to perdition him whom He rejects. When, however, He answers the man, who alleged as an excuse his father's burial, \"Let the dead bury their dead, but go thou and preach the kingdom of God,\"[fn-62-P6230_1858947:926-nf] He gave a clear confirmation to those two laws of the Creator-that in Leviticus, which concerns the sacerdotal office, and forbids the priests to be present at the funerals even of their parents. \"The priest,\" says He, \"shall not enter where there is any dead person;[fn-62-P6231_1859238:927-nf] and for his father he shall not be defiled\"[fn-62-P6232_1859307:928-nf] ; as well as that in Numbers, which relates to the (Nazarite) vow of separation; for there he who devotes himself to God, among other things, is bidden \"not to come at any dead body,\" not even of his father, or his mother, or his brother.[fn-62-P6233_1859601:929-nf] Now it was, I suppose, for the Nazarite and the priestly office that He intended this man whom He had been inspiring[fn-62-P6234_1859740:930-nf] to preach the kingdom of God. Or else, if it be not so, he must be pronounced impious enough who, without the intervention of any precept of the law, commanded that burials of parents should be neglected by their sons. When, indeed, in the third case before us, (Christ) forbids the man \"to look back\" who wanted first \"to bid his family farewell,\" He only follows out the rule[fn-62-P6235_1860135:931-nf] of the Creator.

But if you come from some other god, I should wish you to tell us what you have ever committed to us belonging to yourself,[fn-62-P6202_1852879:898-nf] which it was our duty to believe, seeing that you are upbraiding us with `faithlessness, 'who have never yet revealed to us your own self. How long ago[fn-62-P6203_1853057:899-nf] did you begin to treat with us, that you should be complaining of the delay? On what points have you borne with us, that you should adduce[fn-62-P6204_1853213:900-nf] your patience? Like ¦sop's ass, you are just come from the well,[fn-62-P6205_1853294:901-nf] and are filling every place with your braying.\" I assume, besides,[fn-62-P6206_1853403:902-nf] the person of the disciple, against whom he has inveighed:[fn-62-P6207_1853476:903-nf] \"O perverse nation! how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? \"This outburst of his I might, of course, retort upon him most justly in such words as these: \"Whoever you are, O stranger, first tell us who you are, from whom you come, what right you have over us. Thus far, I suppose, you belong to the Creator, and so we have followed you, recognising in you all things which are His. Now, if you come from Him, we will bear your reproof. If, however, you are acting for another, pry thee tell us what you have ever conferred upon us that is simply your own, which it had become our duty to believe, seeing that you reproach us with `faithlessness, 'although up to this moment you show us no credentials. How long since did you begin to plead with us, that you are charging us with delay? Wherein have you borne with us, that you should even boast of your patience? The ass has only just arrived from ¦sop's well, and he is already braying.\" Now who would not thus have rebutted the unfairness of the rebuke, if he had supposed its author to belong to him who had had no right as yet to complain? Except that not even He[fn-62-P6208_1854631:904-nf] would have inveighed against them, if He had not dwelt among them of old in the law and by the prophets, and with mighty deeds and many mercies, and had always experienced them to be \"faithless.\" But, behold, Christ takes[fn-62-P6209_1854930:905-nf] infants, and teaches how all ought to be like them, if they ever wish to be greater.[fn-62-P6210_1855041:906-nf] The Creator, on the contrary,[fn-62-P6211_1855095:907-nf] let loose bears against children, in order to avenge His prophet Elisha, who had been mocked by them.[fn-62-P6212_1855211:908-nf] This antithesis is impudent enough, since it throws together[fn-62-P6213_1855298:909-nf] things so different as infants[fn-62-P6214_1855347:910-nf] and children,[fn-62-P6215_1855378:911-nf] -an age still innocent, and one already capable of discretion-able to mock, if not to blaspheme. As therefore God is a just God, He spared not impious children, exacting as He does honour for every time of life, and especially, of course, from youth. And as God is good, He so loves infants as to have blessed the midwives in Egypt, when they protected the infants of the Hebrews[fn-62-P6216_1855787:912-nf] which were in peril from Pharaoh's command.[fn-62-P6217_1855855:913-nf] Christ therefore shares this kindness with the Creator. As indeed for Marcion's god, who is an enemy to marriage, how can he possibly seem to be a lover of little children, which are simply the issue of marriage? He who hates the seed must needs also detest the fruit. Yea, he ought to be deemed more ruthless than the king of Egypt.[fn-62-P6218_1856211:914-nf] For whereas Pharaoh forbade infants to be brought up, he will not allow them even to be born, depriving them of their ten months' existence in the womb. And how much more credible it is, that kindness to little children should be attributed to Him who blessed matrimony for the procreation of mankind, and in such benediction included also the promise of connubial fruit itself, the first of which is that of infancy![fn-62-P6219_1856689:915-nf] The Creator, at the request of Elias, inflicts the blow[fn-62-P6220_1856834:916-nf] of fire from heaven in the case of that false prophet (of Baalzebub).[fn-62-P6221_1856932:917-nf] I recognise herein the severity of the Judge. And I, on the contrary, the severe rebuke[fn-62-P6222_1857044:918-nf] of Christ on His disciples, when they were for inflicting[fn-62-P6223_1857475:919-nf] a like visitation on that obscure village of the Samaritans.[fn-62-P6224_1857556:920-nf] The heretic, too, may discover that this gentleness of Christ was promised by the selfsame severest Judge. \"He shall not contend,\" says He, \"nor shall His voice be heard in the street; a bruised reed shall He not crush, and smoking flax shall He not quench.\"[fn-62-P6225_1857838:921-nf] Being of such a character, He was of course much the less disposed to burn men. For even at that time the Lord said to Elias,[fn-62-P6226_1857987:922-nf] \"He was not in the fire, but in the still small voice.\"[fn-62-P6227_1858082:923-nf] Well, but why does this most humane and merciful God reject the man who offers himself to Him as an inseparable companion?[fn-62-P6228_1858229:924-nf] If it were from pride or from hypocrisy that he had said, \"I will follow Thee whithersoever Thou goest, ' then, by judicially reproving an act of either pride or hypocrisy as worthy of rejection, He performed the office of a Judge. And, of course, him whom He rejected He condemned to the loss of not following the Saviour.[fn-62-P6229_1858577:925-nf] For as He calls to salvation him whom He does not reject, or him whom He voluntarily invites, so does He consign to perdition him whom He rejects. When, however, He answers the man, who alleged as an excuse his father's burial, \"Let the dead bury their dead, but go thou and preach the kingdom of God,\"[fn-62-P6230_1858947:926-nf] He gave a clear confirmation to those two laws of the Creator-that in Leviticus, which concerns the sacerdotal office, and forbids the priests to be present at the funerals even of their parents. \"The priest,\" says He, \"shall not enter where there is any dead person;[fn-62-P6231_1859238:927-nf] and for his father he shall not be defiled\"[fn-62-P6232_1859307:928-nf] ; as well as that in Numbers, which relates to the (Nazarite) vow of separation; for there he who devotes himself to God, among other things, is bidden \"not to come at any dead body,\" not even of his father, or his mother, or his brother.[fn-62-P6233_1859601:929-nf] Now it was, I suppose, for the Nazarite and the priestly office that He intended this man whom He had been inspiring[fn-62-P6234_1859740:930-nf] to preach the kingdom of God. Or else, if it be not so, he must be pronounced impious enough who, without the intervention of any precept of the law, commanded that burials of parents should be neglected by their sons. When, indeed, in the third case before us, (Christ) forbids the man \"to look back\" who wanted first \"to bid his family farewell,\" He only follows out the rule[fn-62-P6235_1860135:931-nf] of the Creator. For this (retrospection) He had been against their making, whom He had rescued out of Sodom.[fn-62-P6236_1860259:932-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":9,"verse":35,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":36,"source_paragraph":"118","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But Christ prohibits divorce, saying, \"Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband, also committeth adultery.\"[fn-66-P6658_1950353:1320-nf] In order to forbid divorce, He makes it unlawful to marry a woman that has been put away. Moses, however, permitted repudiation in Deuteronomy: \"When a man hath taken a wife, and hath lived with her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found unchastity in her; then let him write her a bill of divorcement and give it in her hand, and send her away out of his house.\"[fn-66-P6659_1950781:1321-nf] You see, therefore, that there is a difference between the law and the gospel- between Moses and Christ?[fn-66-P6660_1950910:1322-nf] To be sure there is![fn-66-P6661_1950964:1323-nf] But then you have rejected that other gospel which witnesses to the same verity and the same Christ.[fn-66-P6662_1951081:1324-nf] There, while prohibiting divorce, He has given us a solution of this special question respecting it: \"Moses,\" says He, \"because of the hardness of your hearts, suffered you to give a bill of divorcement; but from the beginning it was not so\"[fn-66-P6663_1951354:1325-nf] -for this reason, indeed, because He who had \"made them male and female\" had likewise said, \"They twain shall become one flesh; what therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.\"[fn-66-P6664_1951572:1326-nf] Now, by this answer of His (to the Pharisees), He both sanctioned the provision of Moses, who was His own (servant), and restored to its primitive purpose[fn-66-P6665_1951753:1327-nf] the institution of the Creator, whose Christ He was. Since, however, you are to be refuted out of the Scriptures which you have received, I will meet you on your own ground, as if your Christ were mine. When, therefore, He prohibited divorce, and yet at the same time represented[fn-66-P6666_1952051:1328-nf] the Father, even Him who united male and female, must He not have rather exculpated[fn-66-P6667_1952153:1329-nf] than abolished the enactment of Moses? But, observe, if this Christ be yours when he teaches contrary to Moses and the Creator, on the same principle must He be mine if I can show that His teaching is not contrary to them. I maintain, then, that there was a condition in the prohibition which He now made of divorce; the case supposed being, that a man put away his wife for the express purpose of[fn-66-P6668_1952574:1330-nf] marrying another. His words are: \"Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband, also committeth adultery,\"[fn-66-P6669_1952791:1331-nf] -\"put away,\" that is, for the reason wherefore a woman ought not to be dismissed, that another wife may be obtained. For he who marries a woman who is unlawfully put away is as much of an adulterer as the man who marries one who is un-divorced. Permanent is the marriage which is not rightly dissolved; to marry,[fn-66-P6670_1953127:1332-nf] therefore, whilst matrimony is undissolved, is to commit adultery. Since, therefore, His prohibition of divorce was a conditional one, He did not prohibit absolutely; and what He did not absolutely forbid, that He permitted on some occasions,[fn-66-P6671_1953445:1333-nf] when there is an absence of the cause why He gave His prohibition. In very deed[fn-66-P6672_1953541:1334-nf] His teaching is not contrary to Moses, whose precept He partially[fn-66-P6673_1953651:1335-nf] defends, I will not[fn-66-P6674_1953689:1336-nf] say confirms. If, however, you deny that divorce is in any way permitted by Christ, how is it that you on your side[fn-66-P6675_1953822:1337-nf] destroy marriage, not uniting man and woman, nor admitting to the sacrament of baptism and of the eucharist those who have been united in marriage anywhere else,[fn-66-P6676_1953997:1338-nf] unless they should agree together to repudiate the fruit of their marriage, and so the very Creator Himself? Well, then, what is a husband to do in your sect,[fn-66-P6677_1954213:1339-nf] if his wife commit adultery? Shall he keep her? But your own apostle, you know,[fn-66-P6678_1954311:1340-nf] does not permit \"the members of Christ to be joined to a harlot.\"[fn-66-P6679_1954396:1341-nf] Divorce, therefore, when justly deserved,[fn-66-P6680_1954462:1342-nf] has even in Christ a defender. So that Moses for the future must be considered as being confirmed by Him, since he prohibits divorce in the same sense as Christ does, if any unchastity should occur in the wife. For in the Gospel of Matthew he says, \"Whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery.\"[fn-66-P6681_1954845:1343-nf] He also is deemed equally guilty of adultery, who marries a woman put away by her husband. The Creator, however, except on account of adultery, does not put asunder what He Himself joined together, the same Moses in another passage enacting that he who had married after violence to a damsel, should thenceforth not have it in his power to put away his wife.[fn-66-P6682_1955226:1344-nf] Now, if a compulsory marriage contracted after violence shall be permanent, how much rather shall a voluntary one, the result of agreement! This has the sanction of the prophet: \"Thou shalt not forsake the wife of thy youth.\"[fn-66-P6683_1955481:1345-nf] Thus you have Christ following spontaneously the tracks of the Creator everywhere, both in permitting divorce and in for-bidding it. You find Him also protecting marriage, in whatever direction you try to escape. He prohibits divorce when He will have the marriage inviolable; He permits divorce when the marriage is spotted with unfaithfulness. You should blush when you refuse to unite those whom even your Christ has united; and repeat the blush when you disunite them without the good reason why your Christ would have them separated. I have[fn-66-P6684_1956049:1346-nf] now to show whence the Lord derived this decision[fn-66-P6685_1956115:1347-nf] of His, and to what end He directed it. It will thus become more fully evident that His object was not the abolition of the Mosaic ordinance[fn-66-P6686_1956277:1348-nf] by any suddenly devised proposal of divorce; because it was not suddenly proposed, but had its root in the previously mentioned John. For John reproved Herod, because he had illegally married the wife of his deceased brother, who had a daughter by her (a union which the law permitted only on the one occasion of the brother dying childless,[fn-66-P6687_1956648:1349-nf] when it even prescribed such a marriage, in order that by his own brother, and from his own wife,[fn-66-P6688_1956811:1350-nf] seed might be reckoned to the deceased husband),[fn-66-P6689_1956904:1351-nf] and was in consequence cast into prison, and finally, by the same Herod, was even put to death. The Lord having therefore made mention of John, and of course of the occurrence of his death, hurled His censure[fn-66-P6690_1957139:1352-nf] against Herod in the form of unlawful marriages and of adultery, pronouncing as an adulterer even the man who married a woman that had been put away from her husband. This he said in order the more severely to load Herod with guilt, who had taken his brother's wife, after she had been loosed from her husband not less by death than by divorce; who had been impelled thereto by his lust, not by the prescription of the (Levirate) law-for, as his brother had left a daughter, the marriage with the widow could not be lawful on that very account;[fn-66-P6691_1957709:1353-nf] and who, when the prophet asserted against him the law, had therefore put him to death. The remarks I have advanced on this case will be also of use to me in illustrating the subsequent parable of the rich man[fn-66-P6692_1958021:1354-nf] tormented in hell, and the poor man resting in Abraham's bosom.[fn-66-P6693_1958128:1355-nf] For this passage, so far as its letter goes, comes before us abruptly; but if we regard its sense and purport, it naturally[fn-66-P6694_1958278:1356-nf] fits in with the mention of John wickedly slain, and of Herod, who had been condemned by him for his impious marriage.[fn-66-P6695_1958413:1357-nf] It sets forth in bold outline[fn-66-P6696_1958486:1358-nf] the end of both of them, the \"torments\" of Herod and the \"comfort\" of John, that even now Herod might hear that warning: \"They have there Moses and the prophets, let them hear them.\"[fn-66-P6697_1958689:1359-nf] Marcion, however, violently turns the passage to another end, and decides that both the torment and the comfort are retributions of the Creator reserved in the next life[fn-66-P6698_1958882:1360-nf] for those who have obeyed the law and the prophets; whilst he defines the heavenly bosom and harbour to belong to Christ and his own god. Our answer to this is, that the Scripture itself which dazzles[fn-66-P6699_1959142:1361-nf] his sight expressly distinguishes between Abraham's bosom, where the poor man dwells, and the infernal place of torment. \"Hell\" (I take it) means one thing, and \"Abraham's bosom\" another. \"A great gulf.\" is said to separate those regions, and to hinder a passage from one to the other. Besides, the rich man could not have \"lifted up his eyes,\"[fn-67-P6700_1959569:1362-nf] and from a distance too, except to a superior height, and from the said distance all up through the vast immensity of height and depth. It must therefore be evident to every man of intelligence who has ever heard of the Elysian fields, that there is some determinate place called Abraham's bosom, and that it is designed for the reception of the souls of Abraham's children, even from among the Gentiles (since he is \"the father of many nations,\" which must be classed amongst his family), and of the same faith as that wherewithal he himself believed God, without the yoke of the law and the sign of circumcision. This region, therefore, I call Abraham's bosom. Although it is not in heaven, it is yet higher than hell,[fn-67-P6701_1960313:1363-nf] and is appointed to afford an interval of rest to the souls of the righteous, until the consummation of all things shall complete the resurrection of all men with the \"full recompense of their reward.\"[fn-67-P6702_1960565:1364-nf] This consummation will then be manifested in heavenly promises, which Marcion, however, claims for his own god, just as if the Creator had never announced them. Amos, however, tells us of \"those stories towards heaven\"[fn-67-P6703_1960835:1365-nf] which Christ \"builds\"-of course for His people. There also is that everlasting abode of which Isaiah asks, \"Who shall declare unto you the eternal place, but He (that is, of course, Christ) who walketh in righteousness, speaketh of the straight path, hateth injustice and iniquity? \"[fn-67-P6704_1961363:1366-nf] Now, although this everlasting abode is promised, and the ascending stories (or steps) to heaven are built by the Creator, who further promises that the seed of Abraham shall be even as the stars of heaven, by virtue certainly of the heavenly promise, why may it not be possible,[fn-67-P6705_1961749:1367-nf] without any injury to that promise, that by Abraham's bosom is meant some temporary receptacle of faithful souls, wherein is even now delineated an image of the future, and where is given some foresight of the glory[fn-67-P6706_1961990:1368-nf] of both judgments? If so, you have here, O heretics, during your present lifetime, a warning that Moses and the prophets declare one only God, the Creator, and His only Christ, and how that both awards of everlasting punishment and eternal salvation rest with Him, the one only God, who kills and who makes alive. Well, but the admonition, says Marcion, of our God from heaven has commanded us not to hear Moses and the prophets, but Christ; Hear Him is the command.[fn-67-P6707_1962564:1369-nf] This is true enough. For the apostles had by that time sufficiently heard Moses and the prophets, for they had followed Christ, being persuaded by Moses and the prophets. For even Peter would not have been able[fn-67-P6708_1962835:1370-nf] to say, \"Thou art the Christ,\"[fn-67-P6709_1962892:1371-nf] unless he had beforehand heard and believed Moses and the prophets, by whom alone Christ had been hitherto announced. Their faith, indeed, had deserved this confirmation by such a voice from heaven as should bid them hear Him, whom they had recognized as preaching peace, announcing glad tidings, promising an everlasting abode, building for them steps upwards into heaven.[fn-67-P6710_1963289:1372-nf] Down in hell, however, it was said concerning them: \"They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them!\"-event hose who did not believe them or at least did not sincerely[fn-67-P6711_1963525:1373-nf] believe that after death there were punishments for the arrogance of wealth and the glory of luxury, announced indeed by Moses and the prophets, but decreed by that God, who deposes princes from their thrones, and raiseth up the poor from dunghills.[fn-67-P6712_1963792:1374-nf] Since, therefore, it is quite consistent in the Creator to pronounce different sentences in the two directions of reward and punishment, we shall have to conclude that there is here no diversity of gods,[fn-67-P6713_1964055:1375-nf] but only a difference in the actual matters[fn-67-P6714_1964138:1376-nf] before us.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":9,"verse":20,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":36,"source_paragraph":"118","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But Christ prohibits divorce, saying, \"Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband, also committeth adultery.\"[fn-66-P6658_1950353:1320-nf] In order to forbid divorce, He makes it unlawful to marry a woman that has been put away.

But your own apostle, you know,[fn-66-P6678_1954311:1340-nf] does not permit \"the members of Christ to be joined to a harlot.\"[fn-66-P6679_1954396:1341-nf] Divorce, therefore, when justly deserved,[fn-66-P6680_1954462:1342-nf] has even in Christ a defender. So that Moses for the future must be considered as being confirmed by Him, since he prohibits divorce in the same sense as Christ does, if any unchastity should occur in the wife. For in the Gospel of Matthew he says, \"Whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery.\"[fn-66-P6681_1954845:1343-nf] He also is deemed equally guilty of adultery, who marries a woman put away by her husband. The Creator, however, except on account of adultery, does not put asunder what He Himself joined together, the same Moses in another passage enacting that he who had married after violence to a damsel, should thenceforth not have it in his power to put away his wife.[fn-66-P6682_1955226:1344-nf] Now, if a compulsory marriage contracted after violence shall be permanent, how much rather shall a voluntary one, the result of agreement! This has the sanction of the prophet: \"Thou shalt not forsake the wife of thy youth.\"[fn-66-P6683_1955481:1345-nf] Thus you have Christ following spontaneously the tracks of the Creator everywhere, both in permitting divorce and in for-bidding it. You find Him also protecting marriage, in whatever direction you try to escape. He prohibits divorce when He will have the marriage inviolable; He permits divorce when the marriage is spotted with unfaithfulness. You should blush when you refuse to unite those whom even your Christ has united; and repeat the blush when you disunite them without the good reason why your Christ would have them separated. I have[fn-66-P6684_1956049:1346-nf] now to show whence the Lord derived this decision[fn-66-P6685_1956115:1347-nf] of His, and to what end He directed it. It will thus become more fully evident that His object was not the abolition of the Mosaic ordinance[fn-66-P6686_1956277:1348-nf] by any suddenly devised proposal of divorce; because it was not suddenly proposed, but had its root in the previously mentioned John. For John reproved Herod, because he had illegally married the wife of his deceased brother, who had a daughter by her (a union which the law permitted only on the one occasion of the brother dying childless,[fn-66-P6687_1956648:1349-nf] when it even prescribed such a marriage, in order that by his own brother, and from his own wife,[fn-66-P6688_1956811:1350-nf] seed might be reckoned to the deceased husband),[fn-66-P6689_1956904:1351-nf] and was in consequence cast into prison, and finally, by the same Herod, was even put to death. The Lord having therefore made mention of John, and of course of the occurrence of his death, hurled His censure[fn-66-P6690_1957139:1352-nf] against Herod in the form of unlawful marriages and of adultery, pronouncing as an adulterer even the man who married a woman that had been put away from her husband. This he said in order the more severely to load Herod with guilt, who had taken his brother's wife, after she had been loosed from her husband not less by death than by divorce; who had been impelled thereto by his lust, not by the prescription of the (Levirate) law-for, as his brother had left a daughter, the marriage with the widow could not be lawful on that very account;[fn-66-P6691_1957709:1353-nf] and who, when the prophet asserted against him the law, had therefore put him to death. The remarks I have advanced on this case will be also of use to me in illustrating the subsequent parable of the rich man[fn-66-P6692_1958021:1354-nf] tormented in hell, and the poor man resting in Abraham's bosom.[fn-66-P6693_1958128:1355-nf] For this passage, so far as its letter goes, comes before us abruptly; but if we regard its sense and purport, it naturally[fn-66-P6694_1958278:1356-nf] fits in with the mention of John wickedly slain, and of Herod, who had been condemned by him for his impious marriage.[fn-66-P6695_1958413:1357-nf] It sets forth in bold outline[fn-66-P6696_1958486:1358-nf] the end of both of them, the \"torments\" of Herod and the \"comfort\" of John, that even now Herod might hear that warning: \"They have there Moses and the prophets, let them hear them.\"[fn-66-P6697_1958689:1359-nf] Marcion, however, violently turns the passage to another end, and decides that both the torment and the comfort are retributions of the Creator reserved in the next life[fn-66-P6698_1958882:1360-nf] for those who have obeyed the law and the prophets; whilst he defines the heavenly bosom and harbour to belong to Christ and his own god. Our answer to this is, that the Scripture itself which dazzles[fn-66-P6699_1959142:1361-nf] his sight expressly distinguishes between Abraham's bosom, where the poor man dwells, and the infernal place of torment. \"Hell\" (I take it) means one thing, and \"Abraham's bosom\" another. \"A great gulf.\" is said to separate those regions, and to hinder a passage from one to the other. Besides, the rich man could not have \"lifted up his eyes,\"[fn-67-P6700_1959569:1362-nf] and from a distance too, except to a superior height, and from the said distance all up through the vast immensity of height and depth. It must therefore be evident to every man of intelligence who has ever heard of the Elysian fields, that there is some determinate place called Abraham's bosom, and that it is designed for the reception of the souls of Abraham's children, even from among the Gentiles (since he is \"the father of many nations,\" which must be classed amongst his family), and of the same faith as that wherewithal he himself believed God, without the yoke of the law and the sign of circumcision. This region, therefore, I call Abraham's bosom. Although it is not in heaven, it is yet higher than hell,[fn-67-P6701_1960313:1363-nf] and is appointed to afford an interval of rest to the souls of the righteous, until the consummation of all things shall complete the resurrection of all men with the \"full recompense of their reward.\"[fn-67-P6702_1960565:1364-nf] This consummation will then be manifested in heavenly promises, which Marcion, however, claims for his own god, just as if the Creator had never announced them. Amos, however, tells us of \"those stories towards heaven\"[fn-67-P6703_1960835:1365-nf] which Christ \"builds\"-of course for His people. There also is that everlasting abode of which Isaiah asks, \"Who shall declare unto you the eternal place, but He (that is, of course, Christ) who walketh in righteousness, speaketh of the straight path, hateth injustice and iniquity? \"[fn-67-P6704_1961363:1366-nf] Now, although this everlasting abode is promised, and the ascending stories (or steps) to heaven are built by the Creator, who further promises that the seed of Abraham shall be even as the stars of heaven, by virtue certainly of the heavenly promise, why may it not be possible,[fn-67-P6705_1961749:1367-nf] without any injury to that promise, that by Abraham's bosom is meant some temporary receptacle of faithful souls, wherein is even now delineated an image of the future, and where is given some foresight of the glory[fn-67-P6706_1961990:1368-nf] of both judgments? If so, you have here, O heretics, during your present lifetime, a warning that Moses and the prophets declare one only God, the Creator, and His only Christ, and how that both awards of everlasting punishment and eternal salvation rest with Him, the one only God, who kills and who makes alive. Well, but the admonition, says Marcion, of our God from heaven has commanded us not to hear Moses and the prophets, but Christ; Hear Him is the command.[fn-67-P6707_1962564:1369-nf] This is true enough. For the apostles had by that time sufficiently heard Moses and the prophets, for they had followed Christ, being persuaded by Moses and the prophets. For even Peter would not have been able[fn-67-P6708_1962835:1370-nf] to say, \"Thou art the Christ,\"[fn-67-P6709_1962892:1371-nf] unless he had beforehand heard and believed Moses and the prophets, by whom alone Christ had been hitherto announced. Their faith, indeed, had deserved this confirmation by such a voice from heaven as should bid them hear Him, whom they had recognized as preaching peace, announcing glad tidings, promising an everlasting abode, building for them steps upwards into heaven.[fn-67-P6710_1963289:1372-nf] Down in hell, however, it was said concerning them: \"They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them!\"-event hose who did not believe them or at least did not sincerely[fn-67-P6711_1963525:1373-nf] believe that after death there were punishments for the arrogance of wealth and the glory of luxury, announced indeed by Moses and the prophets, but decreed by that God, who deposes princes from their thrones, and raiseth up the poor from dunghills.[fn-67-P6712_1963792:1374-nf] Since, therefore, it is quite consistent in the Creator to pronounce different sentences in the two directions of reward and punishment, we shall have to conclude that there is here no diversity of gods,[fn-67-P6713_1964055:1375-nf] but only a difference in the actual matters[fn-67-P6714_1964138:1376-nf] before us.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":9,"verse":57,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":25,"source_paragraph":"163","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"54.

As to the events next related, it is true that their exact order is not made apparent by Matthew's narrative. For after the notices of the two incidents in connection with the blind men and the dumb demoniac, he continues in the following manner: \"And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the kingdom of the gospel,[fn-17-P1776_727339:302-nf] and healing every sickness and every disease. But when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion on them, because they were troubled and prostrate,[fn-17-P1777_727522:303-nf] as sheep having no shepherd. Then saith He unto His disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He will send forth[fn-17-P1778_727738:304-nf] labourers into His harvest. And when He had called unto Him His twelve disciples, He gave them power against unclean spirits;\" and so forth, down to the words, \"Verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.\"[fn-17-P1779_728016:305-nf] This whole passage which we have now mentioned shows how He gave many counsels to His disciples. But whether Matthew has subjoined this section in its historical order, or has made its order dependent only on the succession in which it came up to his own mind, as has already been said, is not made apparent. Mark appears to have handled this paragraph in a succinct method, and to have entered upon its recital in the following terms: \"And He went round about the villages, teaching in their circuit:[fn-17-P1780_728545:306-nf] and He called unto Him the twelve, and began to send them by two and two, and gave them power over unclean spirits;\" and so on, down to where we read, \"Shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.\"[fn-17-P1781_728789:307-nf] But before narrating this incident, Mark has inserted, immediately after the story of the raising of the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue, an account of what took place on that occasion on which, in His own country, the people were astonished at the Lord, and asked from whence He had such wisdom and such capabilities,[fn-17-P1782_729137:308-nf] when they perceived His judgment: which account is given by Matthew after these counsels to the disciples, and after a number of other matters.[fn-17-P1783_729298:309-nf] It is uncertain, therefore, whether what thus happened in His own country has been recorded by Matthew in the succession in which it came to mind, after having been omitted at first, or whether it has been introduced by Mark in the way of an anticipation; and which of them, in short, has kept the order of actual occurrence, and which of them the order of his own recollection. Luke, again, in immediate succession to the mention of the raising of the daughter of Jaïrus to life, subjoins this paragraph, bearing on the power and the counsels given to the disciples, and that indeed with as great brevity as Mark.[fn-17-P1784_729937:310-nf] This evangelist, however, does not, any more than the others, introduce the subject in such a way as to produce the impression that it comes in also in the strictly historical order. Moreover, with regard to the names of the disciples, Luke, who gives their names in another place,[fn-17-P1785_730240:311-nf] -that is to say, in the earlier passage, where they are [represented as being] chosen on the mountain,-is not at variance in any respect with Matthew, with the exception of the single instance of the name of Judas the brother of James, whom Matthew designates Thaddaeus, although some codices also read Lebbaeus.[fn-17-P1786_730662:312-nf] But who would ever think of denying that one man may be known under two or three names?","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":9,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":32,"source_paragraph":"187","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"71. Another question which it is also usual to put is this: How comes it that Matthew and Luke have stated that the Lord said to His disciples that they were not to take a staff with them, whereas Mark puts the matter in this way: \"And He commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only;\"[fn-17-P1788_731464:313-nf] and proceeds further in this strain, \"no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:\" thereby making it quite evident that his narrative belongs to the same place and circumstances with which the narratives of those others deal who have mentioned that the staff was not to be taken? Now this question admits of being solved on the principle of understanding that the staff which, according to Mark, was to be taken, bears one sense, and that the staff which,according to Matthew and Luke, was not to be taken with them, is to be interpreted in a different sense; just in the same way as we find the term \"temptation\" used in one meaning, when it is said, \"God tempteth no man,\"[fn-17-P1789_732347:314-nf] and in a different meaning where it is said, \"The Lord your God tempteth [proveth] you, to know whether ye love Him.\"[fn-17-P1790_732484:315-nf] For in the former case the temptation of seduction is intended; but in the latter the temptation of probation. Another parallel occurs in the case of the term \"judgment,\" which must be taken in one way, where it is said, \"They that have done good unto the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of judgment;\"[fn-17-P1791_732849:316-nf] and in another way, where it is said, \"Judge me, O God, and discern[fn-17-P1792_732945:317-nf] my cause, in respect of an ungodly nation.\"[fn-17-P1793_733006:318-nf] For the former refers to the judgment of damnation, and the latter to the judgment of discrimination.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":9,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":45,"source_paragraph":"220","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"91. Matthew continues: \"At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus, and said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist: he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.\"[fn-19-P1900_777772:379-nf] Mark gives the same passage, and in the same manner, but not in the same order.[fn-19-P1901_777878:380-nf] For, after relating how the Lord sent forth the disciples with the charge to take nothing with them on the journey save a staff only, and after bringing to its close so much of the discourse which was then delivered as has been recorded by him, he has subjoined this section. He does not, however, connect it in such a way as to compel us to suppose that what it narrates took place actually in immediate sequence on what precedes it in the history. And in this, indeed, Matthew is at one with him. For Matthew's expression is, \"at that time,\" not \"on that day,\" or \"at that hour.\" Only there is this difference between them, that Mark refers not to Herod himself as the utterer of the words in question, but to the people, his statement being this: \"They said[fn-19-P1902_778664:381-nf] that John the Baptist was risen from the dead;\" whereas Matthew makes Herod himself the speaker, the phrase being: \"He said unto his servants.\" Luke, again, keeping the same order of narration as Mark, and introducing it also indeed, like Mark, in no such way as to compel us to suppose that his order must have been the order of actual occurrence, presents his version of the same passage in the following terms: \"Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by Him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead; and of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again. And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see Him.\"[fn-19-P1903_779638:382-nf] In these words Luke also attests Mark's statement, at least, so far as concerns the affirmation that it was not Herod himself, but other parties, who said that John was risen from the dead. But as regards his mentioning how Herod was perplexed, and his bringing in thereafter those words of the same prince: \"John have I beheaded: but who is this of whom I hear such things?\" we must either understand that after the said perplexity he became persuaded in his own mind of the truth of what was asserted by others, when he spoke to his servants, in accordance with the version given by Matthew, which runs thus: \"And he said to his servants, This is John the Baptist: he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him;\" or we must suppose that these words were uttered in a manner betraying that he was still in a state of perplexity. For had he said, \"Can this be John the Baptist?\" or, \"Can it chance that this is John the Baptist?\" there would have been no need of saying anything about a mode of utterance by which he might have revealed his dubiety and perplexity. But seeing that these forms of expression are not before us, his words may be taken to have been pronounced in either of two ways: so that we may either suppose him to have been convinced by what was said by others, and so to have spoken the words in question with a real belief [in John's reappearance]; or we may imagine him to have been still in that state of hesitancy of which mention is made by Luke. Our explanation is favoured by the fact that Mark, who had already told us how it was by others that the statement was made as to John having risen from the dead, does not fail to let us know also that in the end Herod himself spoke to this effect: \"It is John whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.\"[fn-19-P1904_781477:383-nf] For these words may also be taken to have beenpronounced in either of two ways,-namely, asthe utterances either of one corroborating a fact, or of one in doubt. Moreover, while Luke passes on to a new subject after the notice which he gives of this incident, those other two, Matthew and Mark, take occasion to tell us at this point in what way John was put to death by Herod.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":9,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":47,"source_paragraph":"224","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"93. After stating how the report of John's death was brought to Christ, Matthew continues his account, and introduces it in the following connection: \"When Jesus heard of it, He departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed Him on foot out of the cities. And He went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and He healed their sick.\"[fn-19-P1918_786313:391-nf] He mentions, therefore, that this took place immediately after John had suffered. Consequently it was after this that those things took place which have been previously recorded-namely, the circumstances which alarmed Herod, and induced him to say,\"John have I beheaded.\"[fn-19-P1919_786611:392-nf] For it must surely I be understood that these incidents occurred subsequently which report carried to the ears of Herod, so that he became anxious, and was inperplexity as to who that person possibly could be of whom he heard things so remarkable, when he had himself put John to death. Mark, again, after relating how John suffered, mentions that the disciples who had been sent forth returned to Jesus, and told Him all that they had done and taught; and that the Lord (a fact which he alone records) directed them to rest for a little while in a desert place, and that He went on board a vessel with them, and departed; and that the crowds of people, when they perceived that movement, went before them to that place; and that the Lord had compassion on them, and taught them many things; and that, when the hour was now advancing, it came to pass that all who were present were made to eat of the five loaves and the two fishes.[fn-19-P1920_787563:393-nf] This miracle has been recorded by all the four evangelists. For in like manner, Luke, who has given an account of the death of John at a much earlier stage in his narrative,[fn-19-P1921_787760:394-nf] in connection with the occasion of which we have spoken, in the present context tells us first of Herod's perplexity as to who the Lord could be, and immediately thereafter appends statements to the same effect with those in Mark,-namely, that the apostles returned to Him, and reported to Him all that they had done; and that then He took them with Him and departed into a desert place, and that the multitudes followed Him thither, and that He spake to them concerning the kingdom of God, and restored those who stood in need of healing. Then, too, he mentions that, when the day was declining, the miracle of the five loaves was wrought.[fn-19-P1922_788422:395-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":9,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":47,"source_paragraph":"224","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"93.

Consequently it was after this that those things took place which have been previously recorded-namely, the circumstances which alarmed Herod, and induced him to say,\"John have I beheaded.\"[fn-19-P1919_786611:392-nf] For it must surely I be understood that these incidents occurred subsequently which report carried to the ears of Herod, so that he became anxious, and was inperplexity as to who that person possibly could be of whom he heard things so remarkable, when he had himself put John to death. Mark, again, after relating how John suffered, mentions that the disciples who had been sent forth returned to Jesus, and told Him all that they had done and taught; and that the Lord (a fact which he alone records) directed them to rest for a little while in a desert place, and that He went on board a vessel with them, and departed; and that the crowds of people, when they perceived that movement, went before them to that place; and that the Lord had compassion on them, and taught them many things; and that, when the hour was now advancing, it came to pass that all who were present were made to eat of the five loaves and the two fishes.[fn-19-P1920_787563:393-nf] This miracle has been recorded by all the four evangelists. For in like manner, Luke, who has given an account of the death of John at a much earlier stage in his narrative,[fn-19-P1921_787760:394-nf] in connection with the occasion of which we have spoken, in the present context tells us first of Herod's perplexity as to who the Lord could be, and immediately thereafter appends statements to the same effect with those in Mark,-namely, that the apostles returned to Him, and reported to Him all that they had done; and that then He took them with Him and departed into a desert place, and that the multitudes followed Him thither, and that He spake to them concerning the kingdom of God, and restored those who stood in need of healing. Then, too, he mentions that, when the day was declining, the miracle of the five loaves was wrought.[fn-19-P1922_788422:395-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":9,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":48,"source_paragraph":"227","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"95. Matthew then proceeds and carries on his narrative in due consecution to the said incident connected with the five loaves in the following manner: \"And when it was evening, His disciples came to Him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.

Jesus said therefore, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.

And consequently there is no contradiction between the statements made by Matthew and John as to His going up again to the mountain. The only difference is, that Matthew uses the phrase \"He went up,\" while John's term is \"He departed.\" And there would be an antagonism between these two, only if in departing He had not gone up.

On the other hand, Luke, after the record of the miracle of the five loaves, passes to another subject, and diverges from this order of narration. For he makes no mention of that little ship, and of the Lord's pathway over the waters. But after the statement conveyed in these words, \"And they did all eat, and were filled, and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets,\" he has subjoined the following notice: \"And it came to pass, as He was alone praying, His disciples were with Him; and He asked them, saying, Who say the people that I am?\"[fn-19-P1950_808145:411-nf] Thus he relates in this succession something new, which is not given by those three who have left us the account of the manner in which the Lord walked upon the waters, and came to the disciples when they were on the voyage. It ought not, however, on this account, to be supposed that it was on that same mountain to which Matthew has told us He went up in order to pray alone, that He said to His disciples, \"Who say the people that I am?\" For Luke, too, seems to harmonize with Matthew in this, because his words are, \"as He was alone praying;\" while Matthew's were, \"He went up unto a mountain alone to pray.\" But it must by all means be held to have been on a different occasion that He put this question, since [it is said here, both that] He prayed alone, and [that] the disciples were with Him. Thus Luke, indeed, has mentioned only the fact of His being alone, but has said nothing of His being without His disciples, as is the case with Matthew and John, since [according to these latter] they left Him in order to go before Him to the other side of the sea.

Luke, again, records none of these things in the order here observed, with the exception of the incident with the little child whom He set before His disciples, for their imitation when they were thinking of their own greatness.[fn-20-P2036_835495:451-nf] For if he has also narrated some other matters of a tenor resembling those which are inserted in this discourse, these are sayings which he has recalled for notice in other connections, and on occasions different from the present: just as John[fn-20-P2037_835762:452-nf] introduces the Lord's words on the subject of the forgiveness of sins,-namely, those to the effect that they should be remitted to him to whom the apostles remitted them, and that they should be retained to him to whom they retained them, as spoken by the Lord after His resurrection; while Matthew mentions that in the discourse now under notice the Lord made this declaration, which, however, the self-same evangelist at the same time affirms to have been given on a previous occasion to Peter.[fn-20-P2038_836279:453-nf] Therefore, to preclude the necessity of having always to inculcate the same rule, we ought to bear in mind the fact that Jesus uttered the same word repeatedly, and in a number of different places,-a principle which we have pressed so often upon your attention already; and this consideration should save us from feeling any perplexity, even although the order of the sayings may be thought to create some difficulty.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":9,"verse":51,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":64,"source_paragraph":"268","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"120. Matthew continues giving his narrative in the following manner: \"And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, He departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan; and great multitudes followed Him; and He healed them there.[fn-20-P2042_837346:454-nf] The Pharisees also came unto Him, tempting Him, and saying, Is it lawful top a man to put away his wife for every cause?\" And so on, down to the words, \"He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.\"[fn-20-P2043_838139:455-nf] Mark also records this, and observes the same order. At the same time, we must certainly see to it that no appearance of contradiction be supposed to arise from the circumstance that the same Mark tells us how the Pharisees were asked by the Lord as to what Moses commanded them, and that on His questioning them to that effect they returned the answer regarding the bill of divorcement which Moses suffered them to write; whereas, according to Matthew's version, it was after the Lord had spoken those words in which He had shown them, out of the law, how God made male and female to be one flesh, and how, therefore, those [thus joined together of Him] ought not to be put asunder by man, that they gave the reply, \"Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?\" To this interrogation, also [as Matthew puts it], He says again in reply, \"Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.\" There is no difficulty, I repeat, in this; for it is not the case that Mark makes no kind of mention of the reply which was thus given by the Lord, but he brings it in after the answer which was returned by them to His question relating to the bill of divorcement.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":9,"verse":46,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":65,"source_paragraph":"272","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"123.

Luke, on the other hand, first mentions what He said to those who were asking each other who should be the greatest, and next subjoins at once the passage concerning the man whom they had seen casting out devils, although he did not follow Him; then he parts company with the other two at the point where he tells us how He stedfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem;[fn-20-P2052_844011:459-nf] and after the interposition of a number of subjects,[fn-20-P2053_844087:460-nf] he joins them again in giving the story of the rich man, to whom the word is addressed, \"Sell all that thou hast,\"[fn-20-P2054_844237:461-nf] which individual's case is related here by the other two evangelists, but still in the succession which is followed by all the narratives alike. For in the passage referred to in Luke, that writer does not fail to bring in the story of the little children, just as the other two do immediately before the mention of the rich man. With regard, then, to the accounts which are given us of this rich person, who asks what good thing he should do in order to obtain eternal life, there may appear to be some discrepancy between them, because the words were, according to Matthew, \"Why askest thou me about the good?\" while according to the others they were, \"Why callest thou me good?\" The sentence, \"Why askest thou me about the good?\" may then be referred more particularly to what was expressed by the man when he put the question, \"What good thing shall I do?\" For there we have both the name \"good\" applied to Christ, and the question put.[fn-20-P2055_845204:462-nf] But the address \"Good Master\" does not of itself convey the question.

First, then, let us consider what the hour really is at which He can have been crucified; and then we shall see how it happens that Mark has reported Him to have been crucified at the third hour. Now it was about the sixth hour when Pilate, who was sitting, as has been stated, at the time upon the judgment-seat, delivered Him up to be crucified. The expression is not that it was the sixth hour fully, but only that it was about the sixth hour; that is to say, the fifth hour was entirely gone, and so much of the sixth hour had also been entered upon. These writers, however, could not naturally use such phraseologies as the fifth hour and a quarter, or the fifth hour and a third, or the fifth hour and a hall or anything of that kind. For the Scriptures have the well-known habit of dealing simply with the round numbers, without mention of fractions, especially in matters of time. We have an example of this in the case of the \"eight days,\" after which, as they tell us, He went up into a mountain,[fn-24-P2465_1065272:160-nf] -a space which is given by Matthew and Mark as \"six days after,\"[fn-24-P2466_1065357:161-nf] because they look simply at the days between the one from which the reckoning commences and the one with which it closes. This is particularly to be kept in view when we notice how measured the terms are which John employs here. For he says not \"the sixth hour,\" but \"about the sixth hour.\" And yet, even had he not expressed himself in that way, but had stated merely that it was the sixth hour, it would still be competent for us to interpret the phrase in accordance with the method of speech with which we are, as I said, familiar in Scripture, namely, the use of the round numbers. And thus we could still take the sense quite fairly to be that, on the completion of the fifth hour and the commencement of the sixth, those matters were going on which are recorded in connection with the Lord's crucifixion, until, on the close of the sixth hour, and when He was hanging on the cross, the darkness occurred which is attested by three of the evangelists, namely, Matthew, Mark, and Luke.[fn-24-P2467_1066383:162-nf] ","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":9,"verse":49,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_15_book_iv_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"25","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"6.

Therefore have we erred from the way of truth, and the light of righteousness hath not shined unto us, and the sun hath not risen upon us. We have been wearied in the way of unrighteousness and perdition, and have walked through hard deserts, but have not known the way of the Lord. What hath pride profited us, or what hath the boasting of riches brought to us? All these things have passed away like a shadow.\" Likewise in the cxvth Psalm is shown the price and the reward of suffering: \"Precious,\" it says, \"in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.[fn-78-P7891_2653609:109-nf] In the cxxvth Psalm also is expressed the sadness of the struggle, and the joy of the retribution: \"They who sow,\" it says. \"in tears, shall reap in joy. As they walked, they walked and wept, casting their seeds; but as they come again, they shall come in exultation, bearing their sheaves.\"[fn-78-P7892_2653922:110-nf] And again, in the cxviiith Psalm: \"Blessed are those that are undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord. Blessed are they who search His testimonies, and seek Him out with their whole heart.\"[fn-78-P7893_2654150:111-nf] Moreover, the Lord in the Gospel, Himself the avenger of our persecution and the rewarder of our suffering, says: \"Blessed are they who suffer persecution for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\"[fn-78-P7894_2654391:112-nf] And again: \"Blessed shall ye be when men shall hate you, and shall separate you, and shall expel you, and shall revile your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake. Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy; for, behold, your reward is great in heaven.\"[fn-78-P7895_2654664:113-nf] And once more: \"Whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.\"[fn-78-P7896_2654772:114-nf] Nor do the rewards of the divine promise attend those alone who are reproached and slain; but if the passion itself, be wanting to the faithful, while their faith has remained sound and unconquered, and having forsaken and contemned all his possessions, the Christian has shown that he is following Christ, even be also is honoured by Christ among the martyrs, as He Himself promises and says: \"There is no man that leaveth house, or land, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake, but shall receive seven times as much in this present time, and in the world to come eternal life.\"[fn-78-P7897_2655411:115-nf] In the Apocalypse also He says the same thing: \"And I saw,\" saith he, \"the souls of them that were slain for the name of Jesus and the word of God.\" And when he had placed those who were slain in the first place, he added, saying: \"And whosoever had not worshipped the image of the beast, neither had received his mark upon their forehead or in their hand; \"all these he joins together, as seen by him at one time in the same place, and says, \"And they lived and reigned with Christ.\"[fn-78-P7898_2655923:116-nf] He says that all live and reign with Christ, not only who have been slain; but even whosoever, standing in firmness of the faith and in the fear of God, have not worshipped the image of the beast, and have not consented to his deadly and sacrilegious edicts.","title":"Treatise XI.

The fifth rule Tichonius lays down is one he designates of times,-a rule by which we can frequently discover or conjecture quantities of time which are not expressly mentioned in Scripture. And he says that this rule applies in two ways: either to the figure of speech called synecdoche, or to legitimate numbers. The figure synecdoche either puts the part for the whole, or the whole for the part. As, for example, in reference to the time when, in the presence of only three of His disciples, our Lord was transfigured on the mount, so that His face shone as the sun, and His raiment was white as snow, one evangelist says that this event occurred \"after eight days,\"[fn-52-P5255_2789683:86-nf] while another says that it occurred \"after six days.\"[fn-52-P5256_2789755:87-nf] Now both of these statements about the number of days cannot be true, unless we suppose that the writer who says \"after eight days,\" counted the latter part of the day on which Christ uttered the prediction and the first part of the day on which he showed its fulfillment as two whole days; while the writer who says \"after six days,\" counted only the whole unbroken days between these two. This figure of speech, which puts the part for the whole, explains also the great question about the resurrection of Christ.

The powers of the Spirit,[fn-93-P9332_2562045:77-nf] proved Him to be God, His sufferings attested the flesh of man. If His powers were not without the Spirit[fn-93-P9333_2562311:78-nf] in like manner, were not His sufferings without the flesh. if His flesh with its sufferings was fictitious, for the same reason was the Spirit false with all its powers. Wherefore halve[fn-93-P9334_2562657:79-nf] Christ with a lie? He was wholly the truth. Believe me, He chose rather to be born, than in any part to pretend-and that indeed to His own detriment-that He was bearing about a flesh hardened without bones, solid without muscles, bloody without blood, clothed without the tunic of skin,[fn-93-P9335_2562960:80-nf] hungry without appetite, eating without teeth, speaking without a tongue, so that His word was a phantom to the ears through an imaginary voice. A phantom, too, it was of course after the resurrection, when, showing His hands and His feet for the disciples to examine, He said, \"Behold and see that it is I myself, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have; \"[fn-93-P9336_2563373:81-nf] without doubt, hands, and feet, and bones are not what a spirit possesses, but only the flesh. Howdo you interpret this statement, Marcion, you who tell us that Jesus comes only from the most excellent God, who is both simple and good? See how He rather cheats, and deceives, and juggles the eyes of all, and the senses of all, as well as their access to and contact with Him! You ought rather to have brought Christ down, not from heaven, but from some troop of mountebanks, not as God besides man, but simply as a man, a magician; not as the High Priest of our salvation, but as the conjurer in a show; not as the raiser of the dead, but as the misleader[fn-93-P9337_2564050:82-nf] of the living,-except that, if He were a magician, He must have had a nativity!","title":"On the Flesh of Christ.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":9,"verse":56,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_39_on_the_flesh_of_christ_","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"53","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Well, now, let it be granted that the soul is made apparent by the flesh,[fn-94-P9442_2594441:166-nf] on the assumption that it was evidently necessary[fn-94-P9443_2594511:167-nf] that it should be made apparent in some way or other, that is, as being incognizable to itself and to us: there is still an absurd distinction in this hypothesis, which implies that we are ourselves separate from our soul, when all that we are is soul.

For he who had consulted had no doubt on the subject whether children on birth inherited original sin, which they might wash away by being born again. For be it far from the Christian faith to have at any time doubted on this matter. But he was in doubt whether the washing of regeneration, by which he made no question but that original sin was put away, ought to be given before the eighth day. To which consultation the most blessed Cyprian in reply said: \"But as regards the case of infants, which you say ought not to be baptized within the second or third day after their birth, and that the law of the ancient circumcision should be regarded, so that you think that one who is born should not be baptized and sanctified within the eighth day, we all thought very differently in our council. For to the course which you thought was to be taken no one agreed, but we all rather judged that the grace of a merciful God was not to be denied to any one born of men; for, as the Lord says in His gospel, `the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them.'[fn-57-P5708_2241307:73-nf] As far as we can, we must strive that, if possible, no soul be lost.\"[fn-57-P5709_2241395:74-nf] And a little afterwards he says: \"Nor ought any of us to shudder at what God hath condescended to make. For although the infant is still fresh from its birth, yet it is not such that any one should shudder at kissing it in giving grace and in making peace, since in the kiss of an infant every one of us ought for his very religion's sake to consider the still recent hands of God themselves, which in some sort we are kissing in the man just formed and newly born, when we are embracing that which God has made.\"[fn-57-P5710_2242009:75-nf] A little after, also, he says: \"But if anything could hinder men from obtaining grace, their more heinous sins might rather hinder those who are mature and grown up and older. But again, if even to the greatest sinners, and to those who have before sinned much against God, when they have subsequently believed, remission of sins is granted, and nobody is hindered from baptism and from grace; how much rather ought we to shrink from hindering an infant, who, being lately born, has not sinned, except that, being born after the flesh according to Adam, he has contracted the contagion of the ancient death at his earliest birth; who approaches more easily on this very account to the reception of the forgiveness of sins, in that to him are remitted not his own sins, but the sins of another!\"[fn-57-P5711_2242826:76-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":9,"verse":21,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_42_book_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"74","folder":"ANF-10","text":"\"Then enjoined He His disciples that they should tell no man thai He was the Christ.\"[fn-79-P7961_1695879:109-nf] It is written above that Jesus sent forth these twelve saying unto them, \"Go not into any way of the Gentiles,\"[fn-79-P7962_1696013:110-nf] and the other words which are recorded to have been said to them when He sent them to the apostleship. Did He then wish them when they were already discharging the function of Apostles to proclaim that He was the Christ? For, if He wished it, it is fitting to inquire why He now at all commands the disciples that they should not say that He was the Christ? Or if He did not wish it, how can the things concerning the apostleship be safely maintained? And these things also one may inquire at this place,-whether, when He sent away the Twelve, He did not send them away with the understanding that He was the Christ? But if the Twelve had such understanding, manifestly Peter had it also; how, then, is he now pronounced blessed? For the expression here plainly indicates that now for the first time Peter confessed that Christ was the Son of the living God, Matthew then, according to some of the manuscripts, has written, \"Then He commanded His disciples that they should tell no man that He was the Christ,\" but[fn-79-P7963_1697047:111-nf] Mark says, \"He charged them that they should tell no man of Him; \"[fn-79-P7964_1697136:112-nf] and Luke, \"He charged them and commanded them to tell this to no man.\"[fn-79-P7965_1697229:113-nf] But what is the \"this\"? Was it that also according to him, Peter answered and said to the question, \"Who say ye that I am.\"-\"The Christ, the Son of the living God? \"[fn-79-P7966_1697415:114-nf] You must know, however, that some manuscripts of the Gospel according to Matthew have, \"He charged.\"[fn-79-P7967_1697542:115-nf] The difficulty thus started seems to me a very real difficulty; but let a solution which cannot be impugned be sought out, and let the finder of it bring it forward before all, if it be more credible than that which shall be advanced by us as a fairly temperate view.[fn-79-P7968_1697832:116-nf] Consider, then, if you can say, that the belief that Jesus is the Christ is inferior to the knowledge of that which is believed. And perhaps also there is a difference in the knowledge of Jesus as the Christ, as every one who knows does not know Him alike. From the words in John, \"If ye abide in My word, ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free,\"[fn-79-P7969_1698243:117-nf] it is plain that belief without knowledge is inferior to knowing; but that there is a difference in the knowledge of Jesus as the Christ, as all who know Him do not know Him equally, is a fact self-evident to any one who gives even a very little consideration to the matter. For who would not acknowledge, for example, that Timothy, though he knew that Jesus was the Christ, had not been enlightened to such an extent in the knowledge of Him as the Apostle had been enlightened? And who would not also admit this-that though many, speaking the truth, say about God, \"He has given to me a true knowledge of things that are,\" yet they will not say this with equal insight and apprehension of the things known, nor as knowing the same number of things? But it is not only in respect of the difference of knowing that those who know do not know alike, bat also according to that which is the source of the knowledge; so that according to this he who knows the Son by the revelation of the Father,[fn-79-P7970_1699263:118-nf] as Peter is testified to have known, has the highest beatitude. Now, if these views of ours are sound, you will consider whether the Twelve formerly believed but did not know; but, after believing, they gained also the rudiments of knowledge and knew a few things about Him; and afterwards they continued to advance in knowledge so that they were able to receive the knowledge from the Father who reveals the Son; in which position Peter was, when he was pronounced blessed; for also he is pronounced blessed not merely because he said, \"Thou art the Christ,\" but with the addition, \"the Son of the living God.\" Accordingly Mark and Luke who have recorded that Peter answered and said, \"Thou art the Christ,\" but have not given the addition found in Matthew, have not recorded that he was declared blessed for what had been said, nor the blessing which followed the declaration of blessedness, \"Thou art Peter,\"[fn-79-P7971_1700197:119-nf] etc.","title":"Book XII."},{"chapter":9,"verse":28,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_42_book_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"106","folder":"ANF-10","text":"\"Verily I say unto you there be some of them that stand here that shall not taste of death.\"[fn-80-P8099_1731683:199-nf] Some refer these things to the going up-six days after, or, as Luke says,[fn-81-P8100_1731779:200-nf] eight days-of the three disciples into the high mountain with Jesus apart; and those who adopt this interpretation say that Peter and the remaining two did not taste of death before they saw the Son of man coining in His own kingdom and in His own glory. For when they saw Jesus transfigured before them so that \"His face shone,\" etc., \"they saw the kingdom of God coming with power.\"[fn-81-P8101_1732184:201-nf] For even as some spear-bearers stand around a king, so Moses and Elijah appeared to those who had gone up into the mountains, talking with Jesus. But it is worth while considering whether the sitting on the right hand and on the left band of the Saviour in His kingdom refers to them, so that the words, \"But for whom it is prepared,\" were[fn-81-P8102_1732543:202-nf] spoken because of them. Now this interpretation about the three Apostles not tasting of death until they have seen Jesus transfigured, is adapted to those who are designated by Peter as \"new-born babes longing for the reasonable milk which is without guile,\"[fn-81-P8103_1732823:203-nf] to whom Paul says, \"I have fed you with milk, not with meat,\"[fn-81-P8104_1732906:204-nf] etc. Now, too, every interpretation of a text which is able to build up those who cannot receive greater truths might reasonably be called milk, flowing from the holy ground of the Scriptures, which flows with milk and honey. But he who has been weaned, like Isaac,[fn-81-P8105_1733195:205-nf] worthy of the good cheer and reception which Abraham gave at the weaning of his son, would seek here and in every Scripture food which is different, I think, from that which is meat, indeed, but is not solid food, and from what are figuratively called herbs, which are food to one who has been weaned and is not yet strong but weak, according to the saying, \"He that is weak eateth herbs.\"[fn-81-P8106_1733605:206-nf] In like manner also he who has been weaned, like Samuel, and dedicated by his mother to God,[fn-81-P8107_1733718:207-nf] -she was Hannah, which is, by interpretation, grace, -would be also a son of grace, seeking, like one nurtured in the temple, flesh of God, the holy food of those who are at once perfect and priests.","title":"Book XII."},{"chapter":9,"verse":27,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_42_book_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"114","folder":"ANF-10","text":"But since here it is written in the three Evangelists, \"They shall not taste of death,\"[fn-81-P8132_1742493:220-nf] but in other writers different things are written concerning death, it may not be out of place to bring forward and examine these passages along with the \"taste.\" In the Psalms, then, it is said, \"What man is he that shall live and not see death? \"[fn-81-P8133_1742790:221-nf] And again, in another place, \"Let death come upon them and let them go down into Hades alive; \"[fn-81-P8134_1742909:222-nf] but in one of the prophets, \"Death becoming mighty has swallowed them up; \"[fn-81-P8135_1743004:223-nf] and in the Apocalypse, \"Death and Hades follow some.\"[fn-81-P8136_1743078:224-nf] Now in these passages it appears to me that it is one thing to taste of death, but another thing to see death, and another thing for it to come upon some, and that a fourth thing, different from the aforesaid, is signified by the words, \"Death becoming mighty has swallowed them up,\" and a fifth thing, different from these, by the words, Death and Hades follow them.\" And if yon were to collect them, you would perhaps find also other differences than those which we have mentioned, by a comparison of which with one another and right investigation, you would find the things signified in each place. But here I inquire whether it is a less evil to see death, but a greater evil than seeing to taste of it, but still worse than this that death should follow any one, and not only follow him, but also now come upon him and seize him whom it formerly followed; but to be swallowed up seems to be more grievous than all the things spoken of.

For He alone taught openly those mighty counsels which the Father designed both for all those who have been and shall be well-pleasing to Him, and also for those who have rebelled against His will, whether men or angels, when He said: `They shall come from the east [and from the west[fn-47-P4733_1015097:288-nf] ], and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven: but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness.'[fn-47-P4734_1015276:289-nf] And, `Many shall say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not eaten, and drunk, and prophesied, and cast out demons in Thy name?

Now, therefore, the question is, how could men of the party of the devil belong to the Church, which has no spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing,[fn-35-P3508_1984540:61-nf] of which also it is said, \"My dove is one?\"[fn-35-P3509_1984618:62-nf] But if they cannot, it is clear that she groans among those who are not of her, some treacherously laying wait within, some barking at her gate without. Such men, however, even within, both receive baptism, and possess it, and transmit it holy in itself; nor is it in any way defiled by their wickedness, in which they persevere even to the end. Wherefore the same blessed Cyprian teaches us that baptism is to be considered as consecrated in itself by the words of the gospel, as the Church has received, without joining to it or mingling with it any consideration of waywardness and wickedness on the part of either minister or recipients; since he himself points out to us both truths,-both that there have been some within the Church who did not cherish kindly Christian love, but practised envy and unkind dissension, of whom the Apostle Paul spoke; and also that the envious belong to the devil's party, as he testifies in the most open way in the epistle which he wrote about envy and malignity. Wherefore, since it is clearly possible that in those who belong to the devil's party, Christ's sacrament may yet be holy,-not, indeed, to their salvation, but to their condemnation,and that not only if they are led astray after they have been baptized, but even if they were such in heart when they received the sacrament, renouncing the world (as the same Cyprian shows) in words only and not in deeds;[fn-35-P3510_1986052:63-nf] and since even if afterwards they be brought into the right way, the sacrament is not to be again administered which they received when they were astray; so far as I can see, the case is already clear and evident, that in the question of baptism we have to consider, not who gives, but what he gives; not who receives, but what he receives not who has, but what he has. For if men of the party of the devil, and therefore in no way belonging to the one dove, can yet receive, and have, and give baptism in all its holiness, in no way defiled by their waywardness, as we are taught by the letters of Cyprian himself, how are we ascribing to heretics what does not belong to them? how are we saying that what is really Christ's is theirs, and not rather recognizing in them the signs of our Sovereign, and correcting the deeds of deserters from Him? Wherefore it is one thing, as the holy Cyprian says, \"for those within in the Church, to speak in the name of Christ another thing for those without, who are acting against the Church, to baptize in His name.\"[fn-35-P3511_1987132:64-nf] But both many who are within act against the Church by evil living, and by enticing weak souls to copy their lives; and some who are without speak in Christ's name, and are not forbidden to work the works of Christ, but only to be without, since for the healing of their souls we grasp at them, or reason with them, or exhort them. For he, too, was without who did not follow Christ with His disciples, and yet in Christ's name was casting out devils, which the Lord enjoined that he should not be prevented from doing;[fn-35-P3512_1987679:65-nf] although, certainly, in the point where he was imperfect he was to be made whole, in accordance with the words of the Lord, in which He says, \"He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.\"[fn-35-P3513_1987936:66-nf] Therefore both some things are done outside in the name of Christ not against the Church, and some things are done inside on the devil's part which are against the Church.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":9,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_59_book_ii","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"189","folder":"ANF-01","text":"4.

Soter is a name of five letters; Pater, too, contains five letters; Agape (love), too, consists of five letters; and our Lord, after[fn-70-P7083_1831619:187-nf] blessing the five loaves, fed with them five thousand men. Five virgins[fn-70-P7084_1831771:188-nf] were called wise by the Lord; and, in like manner, five were styled foolish. Again, five men are said to have been with the Lord when He obtained testimony[fn-70-P7085_1831953:189-nf] from the Father,-namely, Peter, and James, and John, and Moses, and Elias. The Lord also, as the fifth person, entered into the apartment of the dead maiden, and raised her up again; for, says [the Scripture], \"He suffered no man to go in, save Peter and James,[fn-70-P7086_1832237:190-nf] and the father and mother of the maiden.\"[fn-70-P7087_1832325:191-nf] The rich man in hell[fn-70-P7088_1832368:192-nf] declared that he had five brothers, to whom he desired that one rising from the dead should go. The pool from which the Lord commanded the paralytic man to go into his house, had five porches. The very form of the cross, too, has five extremities,[fn-70-P7089_1832637:193-nf] two in length, two in breadth, and one in the middle, on which [last] the person rests who is fixed by the nails. Each of our hands has five fingers; we have also five senses; our internal organs may also be reckoned as five, viz., the heart, the liver, the lungs, the spleen, and the kidneys. Moreover, even the whole person may be divided into this number [of parts],-the head, the breast, the belly, the thighs, and the feet. The human race passes through five ages first infancy, then boyhood, then youth, then maturity,[fn-70-P7090_1833233:194-nf] and then old age. Moses delivered the law to the people in five books. Each table which he received from God contained five[fn-70-P7091_1833401:195-nf] commandments. The veil covering[fn-70-P7092_1833629:196-nf] the holy of holies had five pillars. The altar of burnt-offering also was five cubits in breadth.[fn-70-P7093_1833748:197-nf] Five priests were chosen in the wilderness,-namely, Aaron,[fn-70-P7094_1833885:198-nf] Nadab, Abiud, Eleazar, Ithamar.

Augustin answered: You say truly that you will bring forth out of your store with greater abundance things which are not written in the Scriptures. For if you wish to bring forth proofs from holy Scripture, will you bring forth even those which you cannot find therein? But it is in your own power to multiply your lies according to your will. For where is what you quoted written? or when was that either suggested to our Lord, or answered by our Lord? \"Many lay on hands in Thy name, and are not with us,\" are words that no one of the disciples ever uttered to the Son of God; and therefore neither could the answer have been made by Him, \"Let them alone: if they are not against you, they are on your side.\" But there is something somewhat like it which we really do read in the gospel,-that a suggestion was made to the Lord about a certain man who was casting out devils in His name, but did not follow Him with His disciples; and in that case the Lord does say, \"Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us.\"[fn-52-P5276_2547428:224-nf] But this has nothing to do with pointing out parties whom the Lord is supposed to have spared. And if you have been deceived by an apparent resemblance of sentiment, this is not a lie, but merely human infirmity. But if you wished to cast a mist of falsehood over those who are unskilled in holy Scripture, then may you be pricked to the heart, and covered with confusion and corrected. Yet there is a point which we would urge in respect of this very man of whom the suggestion was made to our Lord. For even as at that time, beyond the communion of the disciples, the holiness of Christ was yet of the greatest efficacy, even so now, beyond the communion of the Church, the holiness of the sacraments is of avail. For neither is baptism consecrated save in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. But who will be so utterly insane as to declare that the name of the Son may be of avail even beyond the communion of the Church, but that this is not possible with the names of the Father and of the Holy Ghost? or that it may be of avail in healing a man, but not in consecrating baptism? But it is manifest that outside the communion of the Church, and the most holy bond of unity, and the most excellent gift of charity, neither he by whom the devil is cast out nor he who is baptized obtains eternal life; just as those do not obtain it, who through communion in the sacraments seem indeed to be within, and through the depravity of their character are understood to be without. But that Christ persecuted even with bodily chastisement those whom He drove with scourges from the temple, we have already said above.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":9,"verse":45,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_60_homily_liv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"39","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"Therefore He also reveals the thoughts of his mind, saying, \"Thou savorest[fn-53-P5335_1644592:35-nf] not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.\"","title":"Homily LIV.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":9,"verse":25,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_67_book_vi_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"493","folder":"ANF-02","text":"\"I would never part with virtue for unrighteous gain.\" But plainly, unrighteous gain is pleasure and pain, toil and fear; and, to speak comprehensively, the passions of the soul, the present of which is delightful, the future vexatious. \"For what is the profit,\" it is said, \"if you gain the world and lose the soul? \"[fn-89-P8915_2504074:212-nf] It is clear, then, that those who do not perform good actions, do not know what is for their own advantage.

It is a mystery that is being gone through this day in the Jordan. My mysteries are for myself and my own. There is a mystery here, not for the fulfilling of my own need, but for the designing of a remedy for those who have been wounded. There is a mystery, which gives in these waters the representation of the heavenly streams of the regeneration of men. Suffer it to be so now: when thou seest me doing what seemeth to me good among the works of my hands, in a manner befitting divinity, then attune thy praises to the acts accomplished.

Lend me, therefore, O Baptist, thy right hand for the present economy, even as Mary lent her womb for my birth. Immerse me in the streams of Jordan, even as she who bore me wrapped me m children's swaddling-clothes. Grant me thy baptism even as the Virgin granted me her milk. Lay hold of this head of mine, which the seraphim revere. With thy right hand lay hold of this head, that is related to thyself in kinship. Lay hold of this head, which nature has made to be touched. Lay hold of this head, which for this very purpose has been formed by myself and my Father. Lay hold of this head of mine, which, if one does lay hold of it in piety, will save him from ever suffering shipwreck. Baptize me, who am destined to baptize those who believe on me with water, and with the Spirit, and with fire: with water, capable of washing away the defilement of sins; with the Spirit, capable of making the earthly spiritual; with fire, naturally fitted to consume the thorns of transgressions. On hearing these words, the Baptist directed his mind to the object of the salvation,[fn-12-P1283_349743:21-nf] and comprehended the mystery which he had received, and discharged the divine command; for he was at once pious and ready to obey. And stretching forth slowly his right hand, which seemed both to tremble and to rejoice, he baptized the Lord.

It means I that have been a teacher (1 Cor. ix. 27) of all, that have gathered together countless good deeds, that am waiting for countless crowns, that desired Him so much, as to value His love above all things, who all my days am burning for Him, and hold all things (Phil. iii. 8) of second importance to the love of Him. For even being loved by Christ was not the only thing he cared for, but loving Him exceedingly also. And this last he cared most for (toutou malista hn).

And before he openly enters into his defence against these, he first lays down some seeds of it beforehand. For when he says, \"to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the giving of the Law, and the service of God, and the promises,\" he does but say that God willed them indeed to be saved, and this he showed by His former dealings, and by Christ's having sprung from them, and by what He promised to the Fathers. But they out of their own untreatable temper thrust the benefit away from them. And this is also the reason of his setting down such things as set forth God's gift, not such as were encomiums upon them. For the adoption came of His grace, and so too the glory, and the promises, and the Law. After taking all these things then into consideration, and reflecting how earnest God along with His Son, had been for their salvation, he lifts up his voice aloud, and says, \"Who is[fn-27-P2754_2624863:9-nf] blessed forever.

When the just man falls he shall not be overthrown, because the Lord will stretch out His hand[fn-38-P3865_980424:16-nf] .\" These thoughts, dearly-beloved, must be kept in mind not only for the Easter festival, but also for the sanctification of the whole life, and to this our present exercise ought to be directed, that what has delighted the souls of the faithful by the experience of a short observance may pass into a habit and remain unalterably, and if any fault creep in, it may be destroyed by speedy repentance. And because the cure of old-standing diseases is slow and difficult, remedies should be applied early, when the wounds are fresh, so that rising ever anew from all downfalls, we may deserve to attain to the incorruptible Resurrection of our glorified flesh in Christ Jesus our Lord, Who lives and reigns with the Father and the Holy Ghost for ever and ever. Amen.","title":"Sermon LXXI.

And who, giving away his own garment in winter, goes naked? or what enemy rejoices in the joy of the man that hates him? and what soldier goes to war without a full suit of armour? and what slave who has fulfilled his master's order will not be commended? and who in the race-coarse, having nobly run, does not receive the prize? and who that has washed his garments willingly defiles them?

He was, indeed, just beginning to beat a retreat from his erroneous conviction, as the order of proceedings shows[fn-11-P1144_275224:62-nf] , in so far as when hemmed in by your remonstrances he agreed to say what he had not said before and to acquiesce in that belief to which before he had been opposed. However, when he refused to give his consent to the anathematizing of his blasphemous dogma, you understood, brother[fn-11-P1145_275613:63-nf] , that he abode by his treachery and deserved to receive a verdict of condemnation. And yet, if he grieves over it faithfully and to good purpose, and, late though it be, acknowledges how rightly the bishops' authority has been set in motion; or if with his own mouth and hand in your presence he recants his wrong opinions,no mercy that is shown to him when penitent can be found fault with[fn-11-P1146_276135:64-nf] : because our Lord,that true and \"good shepherd\" who laid downHis life for His sheep[fn-11-P1147_276456:65-nf] and who came to save not lose men's souls[fn-11-P1148_276525:66-nf] , wishes us to imitate His kindness[fn-11-P1149_276582:67-nf] ; in order that while justice constrains us when we sin, mercy may prevent our rejection when we have returned.
