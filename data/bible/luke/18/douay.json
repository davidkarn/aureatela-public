{"verses":["And he spoke also a parable to them, that we ought always to pray\nand not to faint,","Saying:  There was a judge in a certain city, who feared not God\nnor regarded man.","And there was a certain widow in that city; and she came to him,\nsaying:  Avenge me of my adversary.","And he would not for a long time.  But afterwards he said within\nhimself:  Although I fear not God nor regard man,","Yet because this widow is troublesome to me, I will avenge her,\nlest continually coming she weary me.","And the Lord said:  Hear what the unjust judge saith.","And will not God revenge his elect who cry to him day and night?\nAnd will he have patience in their regard?","I say to you that he will quickly revenge them.

Which when the disciples saw, they rebuked them.","But Jesus, calling them together, said:  Suffer children to come\nto me and forbid them not:  for of such is the kingdom of God.","Amen, I say to you:  Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of\nGod as a child shall not enter into it.","And a certain ruler asked him, saying:  Good master, what shall I\ndo to possess everlasting life?","And Jesus said to him:  Why dost thou call me good?  None is good\nbut God alone.","Thou knowest the commandments:  Thou shalt not kill.  Thou shalt\nnot commit adultery:  Thou shalt not steal:  Thou shalt not bear false\nwitness:  Honour thy father and mother.","Who said:  All these things have I kept from my youth.","Which when Jesus had heard, he said to him:  Yet one thing is\nwanting to thee.  Sell all whatever thou hast and give to the poor:  and\nthou shalt have treasure in heaven.  And come, follow me.","He having heard these things, became sorrowful:  for he was very\nrich.","And Jesus seeing him become sorrowful, said:  How hardly shall\nthey that have riches enter into the kingdom of God","For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle\nthan for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.","And they that heard it said:  Who then can be saved?","He said to them:  The things that are impossible with men are\npossible with God.","Then Peter said:  Behold, we have left all things and have\nfollowed thee.","Who said to them:  Amen, I say to you, there is no man that hath\nleft home or parents or brethren or wife or children, for the kingdom\nof God's sake,","Who shall not receive much more in this present time, and in the\nworld to come life everlasting.","Then Jesus took unto him the twelve and said to them:  Behold, we\ngo up to Jerusalem; and all things shall be accomplished which were\nwritten by the prophets concerning the Son of man.","For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles and shall be mocked\nand scourged and spit upon.","And after they have scourged him, they will put him to death.\nAnd the third day he shall rise again.","And they understood none of these things, and this word was hid\nfrom them:  and they understood not the things that were said.","Now it came to pass, when he drew nigh to Jericho, that a\ncertain blind man sat by the way side, begging.","And when he heard the multitude passing by, he asked what this\nmeant.","And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.","And he cried out, saying:  Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.","And they that went before rebuked him, that he should hold his\npeace:  but he cried out much more:  Son of David, have mercy on me.","And Jesus standing, commanded him to be brought unto him.
