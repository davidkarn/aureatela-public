That I may not make myself tedious or exceed the due limits of a letter by repeating old stories, I will briefly relate to you an incident which happened in my childhood. The saintly Athanasius bishop of Alexandria had summoned the blessed Antony to that city to confute the heretics there. Hereupon Didymus, a man of great learning who had lost his eyes, came to visit the hermit and, the conversation turning upon the holy scriptures, Antony could not help admiring his ability and eulogizing his insight. At last he said: You do not regret, do you, the loss of your eyes? At first Didymus was ashamed to answer, but when the question had been repeated a second time and a third, he frankly confessed that his blindness was a great grief to him. Whereupon Antony said: \"I am surprised that a wise man should grieve at the loss of a faculty which he shares with ants and flies and gnats, and not rejoice rather in having one of which only saints and apostles have been thought worthy.\" From this story you may perceive how much better it is to have spiritual than carnal vision and to possess eyes into which the mote of sin cannot fall.[fn-28-P2824_742150:2007-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":6,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1116","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"22.

A Christian, even although rich, would perhaps not afford (all) these. Set before yourself, I beg of you, the examples of Gentiles. Most Gentile women, noble in extraction and wealthy in property, unite themselves indiscriminately with the ignoble and the mean, sought out for themselves for luxurious, or mutilated for licentious, purposes. Some take up with their own freedmen and slaves, despising public opinion, provided they may but have (husbands) from whom to fear no impediment to their own liberty. To a Christian believer it is irksome to wed a believer inferior to herself in estate, destined as she will be to have her wealth augmented in the person of a poor husband! For if it is \"the pour,\" not the rich, \"whose are the kingdoms of the heavens,\"[fn-9-P919_224103:57-nf] the rich will find more in the poor (than she brings him, or than she would in the rich). She will be dowered with an ampler dowry from the goods of him who is rich in God. Let her be on an equality with him. on earth, who in the heavens will perhaps not be so. Is there need for doubt, and inquiry, and repeated deliberation, whether he whom God has entrusted with His own property[fn-9-P920_224654:58-nf] is fit for dotal endowments?[fn-9-P921_224696:59-nf] Whence are we to find (words) enough fully to tell the happiness of that marriage which the Church cements, and the oblation confirms, and the benediction signs and seals; (which) angels carry back the news of (to heaven), (which) the Father holds for ratified? For even on earth children[fn-9-P922_225031:60-nf] do not rightly and lawfully wed without their fathers' consent. What kind of yoke is that of two believers, (partakers) of one hope, one desire,[fn-9-P923_225188:61-nf] one discipline, one and the same service? Both (are) brethren, both fellow servants, no difference of spirit or of flesh; nay, (they are) truly \"two in one flesh.\"[fn-9-P924_225436:62-nf] Where the flesh is one, one is the spirit ton. Together they pray, together prostrate themselves, together perform their fasts; mutually teaching, mutually exhorting,[fn-9-P925_225658:63-nf] mutually sustaining. Equally (are they) both (found) in the Church of God; equally at the banquet of God; equally in straits, in persecutions, in refreshments. Neither hides (ought) from the other; neither shuns the other; neither is troublesome to the other. The sick is visited, the indigent relieved, with freedom. Alms (are given) without (danger of ensuing) torment; sacrifices (attended) without scruple; daily diligence (discharged) without impediment: (there is) no stealthy signing, no trembling greeting, no mute benediction. Between the two echo psalms and hymns;[fn-9-P926_226252:64-nf] and they mutually challenge each other which shall better chant to their Lord. Such things when Christ sees and hears, He joys. To these He sends His own I peace.[fn-9-P927_226446:65-nf] Where two (are), there withal (is) He Himself.[fn-9-P928_226518:66-nf] Where He (is), there the Evil One is not.","title":"Book II.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_08_homily_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"But consider how Christ accredited his words by His deeds.

But the sense in which the apostle did write will be apparent, if first an agreement be come to that he did not write it in the sense of which the Psychics avail themselves. Such an agreement, moreover, will be come to if one first recall to mind those (passages) which are diverse from the passage in question, when tried by the standard of doctrine, of volition, and of Paul's own discipline. For, if he permits second nuptials, which were not \"from the beginning,\" how does he affirm that all things are being recollected to the beginning in Christ?[fn-12-P1200_320246:88-nf] If he wills us to iterate conjugal connections, how does he maintain that \"our seed is called\" in the but once married Isaac as its author? How does he make monogamy the base of his disposition of the whole Ecclesiastical Order, if this rule does not antecedently hold good in the case of laics, from whose ranks the Ecclesiastical Order proceeds?[fn-12-P1201_320616:89-nf] How does he call away from the enjoyment of marriage such as are still in the married position, saying that \"the time is wound up,\" if he calls back again into marriage such as through death had escaped from marriage? If these (passages) are diverse from that one about which the present question is, it will be agreed (as we have said) that he did not write in that sense of which the Psychics avail themselves; inasmuch as it is easier (of belief) that that one passage should have some explanation agreeable with the others, than that an apostle should seem to have taught (principles) mutually diverse. That explanation we shall be able to discover in the subject-matter itself. What was the subject-matter which led the apostle to write such (words)? The inexperience of a new and just rising Church, which he was rearing, to wit, \"with milk,\" not yet with the \"solid food\"[fn-12-P1202_321526:90-nf] of stronger doctrine; inexperience so great, that that infancy of faith prevented them from yet knowing what they were to do in regard of carnal and sexual necessity. The very phases themselves of this (inexperience) are intelligible from (the apostle's) rescripts, when he says:[fn-12-P1203_321851:91-nf] \"But concerning these (things) which ye write; good it is for a man not to touch a woman; but, on account of fornications, let each one have his own wife.\" He shows that there were who, having been \"apprehended by the faith\" in (the state of) marriage, were apprehensive that it might not be lawful for them thenceforward to enjoy their marriage, because they had believed on the holy flesh of Christ. And yet it is \"by way of allowance\" that he makes the concession, \"not by way of command; \"that is, indulging, not enjoining, the practice. On the other hand, he \"willed rather\" that all should be what he himself was. Similarly, too, in sending a rescript on (the subject of) divorce, he demonstrates that some had been thinking over that also, chiefly because withal they did not suppose that they were to persevere, after faith, in heathen marriages. They sought counsel, further, \"concerning virgins\"-for \"precept of the Lord\" there was none-(and were told) that \"it is good for a man if he so remain permanently; \"(\"so\"), of course, as he may have been found by the faith. \"Thou hast been bound to a wife, seek not loosing; thou hast been loosed from a wife, seek not a wife.\" \"But if thou shalt have taken to (thyself) a wife, thou hast not sinned; \"because to one who, before believing, had been \"loosed from a wife,\" she will not be counted a second wife who, subsequently to believing, is the first: for it is from (the time of our) believing that our life itself dates its origin. But here he says that he \"is sparing them; \"else \"pressure of the flesh\" would shortly follow, in consequence of the straits of the times, which shunned the encumbrances of marriage: yea, rather solicitude must be felt about earning the Lord's favour than a husband's. And thus he recalls his permission. So, then, in the very same passage in which he definitely rules that \"each one ought permanently to remain in that calling in which he shall be called; \"adding, \"A woman is bound so long as her husband liveth; but if he shall have fallen asleep, she is free: whom she shall wish let her marry, only in the Lord,\" he hence also demonstrates that such a woman is to be understood as has withal herself been \"found\" (by the faith) \"loosed from a husband,\" similarly as the husband \"loosed from a wife\"-the \"loosing\" having taken place through death, of course, not through divorce; inasmuch as to the divorced he would grant no permission to marry, in the teeth of the primary precept. And so \"a woman, if she shall have married, will not sin; \"because he will not be reckoned a second husband who is, subsequently to her believing, the first, any more (than a wife thus taken will be counted a second wife). And so truly is this the case, that he therefore adds, \"only in the Lord; \"because the question in agitation was about her who had had a heathen (husband), and had believed subsequently to losing him: for fear, to wit, that she might presume herself able to marry a heathen even after believing; albeit not even this is an object of care to the Psychics. Let us plainly know that, in the Greek original, it does not stand in the form which (through the either crafty or simple alteration of two syllables) has gone out into common use, \"But if her husband shall have fallen asleep,\" as if it were speaking of the future, and thereby seemed to pertain to her who has lost her husband when already in a believing state. If this indeed had been so, licence let loose without limit would have granted a (fresh) husband as often as one had been lost, without any such modesty in marrying as is congruous even to heathens. But even if it had been so, as if referring to future tim, e, \"If any (woman's). husband shall have died, even the future would just as much pertain to her whose husband shall die before she believed.

And they, plainly, will give husbands and wives as they would morsels of bread; for this is their rendering of \"To every one who asketh thee thou shalt give!\"[fn-11-P1198_318501:86-nf] And they will join you together in a virgin church, the one betrothed of the one Christ! And you will pray for your husbands, the new and the old. Make your election, to which of the twain you will play the adulteress. I think, to both. But if you have any wisdom, be silent on behalf of the dead one. Let your silence be to him a divorce, already endorsed in the dotal gifts of another. In this way you will earn the new husband's favour, if you forget the old. You ought to take more pains to please him for whose sake you have not preferred to please God! Such (conduct) the Psychics will have it the apostle approved, or else totally failed to think about, when he wrote: \"The woman is bound for such length of time as her husband liveth; but if he shall have died, she is free; whom she will let her marry, only in the Lord.\"[fn-11-P1199_319394:87-nf] For it is out of this passage that they draw their defence of the licence of second marriage; nay, even of (marriages) to any amount, if of second (marriage): for that which has ceased to be once for all, is open to any and every number. But the sense in which the apostle did write will be apparent, if first an agreement be come to that he did not write it in the sense of which the Psychics avail themselves. Such an agreement, moreover, will be come to if one first recall to mind those (passages) which are diverse from the passage in question, when tried by the standard of doctrine, of volition, and of Paul's own discipline. For, if he permits second nuptials, which were not \"from the beginning,\" how does he affirm that all things are being recollected to the beginning in Christ?[fn-12-P1200_320246:88-nf] If he wills us to iterate conjugal connections, how does he maintain that \"our seed is called\" in the but once married Isaac as its author? How does he make monogamy the base of his disposition of the whole Ecclesiastical Order, if this rule does not antecedently hold good in the case of laics, from whose ranks the Ecclesiastical Order proceeds?[fn-12-P1201_320616:89-nf] How does he call away from the enjoyment of marriage such as are still in the married position, saying that \"the time is wound up,\" if he calls back again into marriage such as through death had escaped from marriage? If these (passages) are diverse from that one about which the present question is, it will be agreed (as we have said) that he did not write in that sense of which the Psychics avail themselves; inasmuch as it is easier (of belief) that that one passage should have some explanation agreeable with the others, than that an apostle should seem to have taught (principles) mutually diverse. That explanation we shall be able to discover in the subject-matter itself. What was the subject-matter which led the apostle to write such (words)? The inexperience of a new and just rising Church, which he was rearing, to wit, \"with milk,\" not yet with the \"solid food\"[fn-12-P1202_321526:90-nf] of stronger doctrine; inexperience so great, that that infancy of faith prevented them from yet knowing what they were to do in regard of carnal and sexual necessity. The very phases themselves of this (inexperience) are intelligible from (the apostle's) rescripts, when he says:[fn-12-P1203_321851:91-nf] \"But concerning these (things) which ye write; good it is for a man not to touch a woman; but, on account of fornications, let each one have his own wife.\" He shows that there were who, having been \"apprehended by the faith\" in (the state of) marriage, were apprehensive that it might not be lawful for them thenceforward to enjoy their marriage, because they had believed on the holy flesh of Christ. And yet it is \"by way of allowance\" that he makes the concession, \"not by way of command; \"that is, indulging, not enjoining, the practice. On the other hand, he \"willed rather\" that all should be what he himself was. Similarly, too, in sending a rescript on (the subject of) divorce, he demonstrates that some had been thinking over that also, chiefly because withal they did not suppose that they were to persevere, after faith, in heathen marriages. They sought counsel, further, \"concerning virgins\"-for \"precept of the Lord\" there was none-(and were told) that \"it is good for a man if he so remain permanently; \"(\"so\"), of course, as he may have been found by the faith. \"Thou hast been bound to a wife, seek not loosing; thou hast been loosed from a wife, seek not a wife.\" \"But if thou shalt have taken to (thyself) a wife, thou hast not sinned; \"because to one who, before believing, had been \"loosed from a wife,\" she will not be counted a second wife who, subsequently to believing, is the first: for it is from (the time of our) believing that our life itself dates its origin. But here he says that he \"is sparing them; \"else \"pressure of the flesh\" would shortly follow, in consequence of the straits of the times, which shunned the encumbrances of marriage: yea, rather solicitude must be felt about earning the Lord's favour than a husband's. And thus he recalls his permission. So, then, in the very same passage in which he definitely rules that \"each one ought permanently to remain in that calling in which he shall be called; \"adding, \"A woman is bound so long as her husband liveth; but if he shall have fallen asleep, she is free: whom she shall wish let her marry, only in the Lord,\" he hence also demonstrates that such a woman is to be understood as has withal herself been \"found\" (by the faith) \"loosed from a husband,\" similarly as the husband \"loosed from a wife\"-the \"loosing\" having taken place through death, of course, not through divorce; inasmuch as to the divorced he would grant no permission to marry, in the teeth of the primary precept. And so \"a woman, if she shall have married, will not sin; \"because he will not be reckoned a second husband who is, subsequently to her believing, the first, any more (than a wife thus taken will be counted a second wife). And so truly is this the case, that he therefore adds, \"only in the Lord; \"because the question in agitation was about her who had had a heathen (husband), and had believed subsequently to losing him: for fear, to wit, that she might presume herself able to marry a heathen even after believing; albeit not even this is an object of care to the Psychics. Let us plainly know that, in the Greek original, it does not stand in the form which (through the either crafty or simple alteration of two syllables) has gone out into common use, \"But if her husband shall have fallen asleep,\" as if it were speaking of the future, and thereby seemed to pertain to her who has lost her husband when already in a believing state. If this indeed had been so, licence let loose without limit would have granted a (fresh) husband as often as one had been lost, without any such modesty in marrying as is congruous even to heathens. But even if it had been so, as if referring to future tim, e, \"If any (woman's). husband shall have died, even the future would just as much pertain to her whose husband shall die before she believed. Take it which way you. will, provided you do not overturn the rest.

It is one thing to fail at present in attaining to the fulness of love, and another thing to be swayed by no lust. A man ought therefore to abstain from every unlawful desire, although he loves God now far less than it is possible to love Him when He becomes an object of sight; just as in matters connected with the bodily senses, the eye can receive no pleasure from any kind of darkness, although it may be unable to look with a firm sight amidst refulgent light. Only let us see to it that we so constitute the soul of man in this corruptible body,that, although it has not yet swallowed up and consumed the motions of earthly lust in that super-eminent perfection of the love of God, it nevertheless, in that inferior righteousness to which we have referred, gives no consent to the aforesaid lust for the purpose of effecting any unlawful thing. In respect, therefore, of that immortal life, the commandment is even now applicable: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might;\"[fn-18-P1841_803645:387-nf] but in reference to the present life the following: \"Let not sin reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.\"[fn-18-P1842_803803:388-nf] To the one, again, belongs, \"Thou shalt not covet;\"[fn-18-P1843_803875:389-nf] to the other, \"Thou shalt not go after thy lusts.\"[fn-18-P1844_803945:390-nf] To the one it appertains to seek for nothing more than to continue in its perfect state; to the other it belongs actively to do the duty committed to it, and to hope as its reward for the perfection of the future life,-so that in the one the just man may live forevermore in the sight of that happiness which in this life was his object of desire; in the other, he may live by that faith whereon rests his desire for the ultimate blessedness as its certain end. (These things being so, it will be sin in the man who lives by faith ever to consent to an unlawful delight,-by committing not only frightful deeds and crimes, but even trifling faults; sinful, if he lend an ear to a word that ought not to be listened to, or a tongue to a phrase which shouldnot be uttered; sinful, if he entertains a thought in his heart in such a way as to wish that an evil pleasure were a lawful one, although known to be unlawful by the commandment,-for this amounts to a consent to sin, which would certainly be carried out in act, unless fear of punishment deterred.)[fn-18-P1845_805025:391-nf] Have such just men, while living by faith, no need to say: \"Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors?\"[fn-18-P1846_805344:392-nf] And do they prove this to be wrong which is written, \"In Thy sight shall no man living be justified?\"[fn-18-P1847_805466:393-nf] and this: \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us?\"[fn-18-P1848_805581:394-nf] and, \"There is no manthat sinneth not;\"[fn-18-P1849_805641:395-nf] and again, \"There is not on the earth a righteous man, who doeth good and sinneth not\"[fn-18-P1850_805753:396-nf] (for both these statements are expressed in a general future sense,-\"sinneth not,\" \"will not sin,\"-not in the past time, \"has not sinned\")?-and all other places of this purport contained in the Holy Scripture? Since, however, these passages cannot possibly be false, it plainly follows, to my mind, that whatever be the quality or extent of the righteousness which we may definitely ascribe to the present life, there is not a man living in it who is absolutely free from all sin; and that it is necessary for every one to give, that it may be given to him;[fn-18-P1851_806335:397-nf] and to forgive, that it may be forgiven him;[fn-18-P1852_806404:398-nf] and whatever righteousness he has, not to presume that he has it of himself, but from the grace of God, who justifies him, and still to go on hungering and thirsting for righteousness[fn-18-P1853_806607:399-nf] from Him who is the living bread,[fn-18-P1854_806660:400-nf] and with whom is the fountain of life;[fn-18-P1855_806719:401-nf] who works in His saints, whilst labouring amidst temptation in this life, their justification in such manner that He may still have somewhat to impart to them liberally when they ask, and something mercifully to forgive them when they confess.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_08_book_i_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"132","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"53.

If, then, the idea of humanityin Adam and Abel does not vary with the difference of their origin, neither the order nor the manner of their coming into existence making any difference in their nature, which is the same in both, according to the testimony of every one in his senses, and no one, not greatly needing treatment for insanity, would deny it; what necessity is there that against the divine nature we should admit this strange thought? Having heard of Father and Son from the Truth, we are taught in those two subjects the oneness of their nature; their natural relation to each other expressed by those names indicates that nature; and so do Our Lord's own words. For when He said, \"I and My Father are one[fn-8-P815_414598:120-nf] ,\" He conveys by that confession of a Father exactly the truth that He Himself is not a first cause, at the same time that He asserts by His union with the Father their common nature; so that these words of His secure our faith from the taint of heretical error on either side: for Sabellius has no ground for his confusion of the individuality of each Person, when the Only-begotten has so distinctly marked Himself off from the Father in those words, \"I and My Father;\" and Arius finds no confirmation of his doctrine of the strangeness of either nature to the other, since this oneness of both cannot admit distinction in nature. For that which is signified in these words by the oneness of Father and Son is nothing else but what belongs to them on the score of their actual being; all the other moral excellences which are to be observed in them as over and above[fn-8-P816_415486:121-nf] their nature may without error be set down as shared in by all created beings. For instance, Our Lord is called merciful and pitiful by the prophet[fn-8-P817_415668:122-nf] , and He wills us to be and to be called the same;. \"Be ye therefore merciful[fn-8-P818_415768:123-nf] ,\" and \"Blessed are the merciful[fn-8-P819_415821:124-nf] ,\" and many such passages. If, then, any one by diligence and attention has modelled himself according to the divine will, and become kind and pitiful and compassionate, or meek and lowly of heart, such as many of the saints are testified to have become in the pursuit of such excellences, does it follow that they are therefore one with God, or united to Him by virtue of any one of them? Not so. That which is not in every respect the same, cannot be `one' with him whose nature thus varies from it. Accordingly, a man becomes `one' with another, when in will, as our Lord says, they are `perfected into ones[fn-8-P820_416453:125-nf] ,' this union of wills being added to the connexion of nature. So also the Father and Son are one, the community of nature and the community of will running, in them, into one.

Therefore shall a man leave his father and mother, and he shall cleave unto his wife; and they two shall be one flesh.\"[fn-27-P2797_947708:166-nf] But this (gift of prophecy) only came on him afterwards, when God infused into him the ecstasy, or spiritual quality, in which prophecy consists. If, again, the evil of sin was developed in him, this must not be accounted as a natural disposition: it was rather produced by the instigation of the (old) serpent as far from being incidental to his nature as it was from being material in him, for we have already excluded belief in \"Matter.\"[fn-27-P2798_948173:167-nf] Now, if neither the spiritual element, nor what the heretics call the material element, was properly inherent in him (since, if he had been created out of matter, the germ of evil must have been an integral part of his constitution), it remains that the one only original element of his nature was what is called the animal (the principle of vitality, the soul), which we maintain to be simple and uniform in its condition. Concerning this, it remains for us to inquire whether, as being called natural, it ought to be deemed subject to change. (The heretics whom we have referred to) deny that nature is susceptible of any change,[fn-27-P2799_948836:168-nf] in order that they may be able to establish and settle their threefold theory, or \"trinity,\" in all its characteristics as to the several natures, because \"a good tree cannot produce evil fruit, nor a corrupt tree good fruit; and nobody gathers figs of thorns, nor grapes of brambles.\"[fn-28-P2800_949154:169-nf] If so, then \"God will not be able any longer to raise up from the stones children unto Abraham; nor to make a generation of vipers bring forth fruits of repentance.\"[fn-28-P2801_949344:170-nf] And if so, the apostle too was in error when he said in his epistle, \"Ye were at one time darkness, (but now are ye light in the Lord: )\"[fn-28-P2802_949505:171-nf] and, \"We also were by nature children of wrath; \"[fn-28-P2803_949573:172-nf] and, \"Such were some of you, but ye are washed.\"[fn-28-P2804_949641:173-nf] The statements, however, of holy Scripture will never be discordant with truth. A corrupt tree will never yield good fruit, unless the better nature be grafted into it; nor will a good tree produce evil fruit, except by the same process of cultivation. Stones also will become children of Abraham, if educated in Abraham's faith; and a generation of vipers will bring forth the fruits of penitence, if they reject the poison of their malignant nature. This will be the power of the grace of God, more potent indeed than nature, exercising its sway over the faculty that underlies itself within us-even the freedom of our will, which is described as au0tecou/sioj (of independent authority); and inasmuch as this faculty is itself also natural and mutable, in whatsoever direction it turns, it inclines of its own nature.

Now that which has received its constitution by being made or by being born, is by nature capable of being changed, for it can be both born again and re-made; whereas that which is not-made and unborn will remain for ever immoveable. Since, however, this state is suited to God alone, as the only Being who is unborn and not-made (and therefore immortal and unchangeable), it is absolutely certain that the nature of all other existences which are born and created is subject to modification and change; so that if the threefold state is to be ascribed to the soul, it must be supposed to arise from the mutability of its accidental circumstances, and not from the appointment of nature.","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":27,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_22_a_treatise_on_the_soul_","source_chapter":37,"source_paragraph":"137","folder":"ANF-03","text":"However, it is not for you alone, (Simon), that the transmigration philosophy has fabricated this story.

The transmigration of human souls, therefore, into any kind of heterogeneous bodies, he thought by all means indispensable, whenever any depravity whatever had not been fully perpetrated in the early stage of life's passage. Evil deeds (one may be sure) appertain to life. Moreover, as often as the soul has fallen short as a defaulter in sin, it has to be recalled to existence, until it \"pays the utmost farthing,\"[fn-29-P2913_1022565:240-nf] thrust out from time to time into the prison of the body. To this effect does he tamper with the whole of that allegory of the Lord which is extremely clear and simple in its meaning, and ought to be from the first understood in its plain and natural sense. Thus our \"adversary\" (therein mentioned[fn-29-P2914_1022883:241-nf] ) is the heathen man, who is walking with us along the same road of life which is common to him and ourselves. Now \"we must needs go out of the world,\"[fn-29-P2915_1023051:242-nf] if it be not allowed us to have conversation with them. He bids us, therefore, show a kindly disposition to such a man. \"Love your enemies,\" says He, \"pray for them that curse you,\"[fn-29-P2916_1023254:243-nf] lest such a man in any transaction of business be irritated by any unjust conduct of yours, and \"deliver thee to the judge\" of his own (nation[fn-29-P2917_1023417:244-nf] ), and you be thrown into prison, and be detained in its close and narrow cell until you have liquidated all your debt against him.[fn-29-P2918_1023569:245-nf] Then, again, should you be disposed to apply the term \"adversary\" to the devil, you are advised by the (Lord's) injunction, while you are in the way with him,\" to make even with him such a compact as may be deemed compatible with the requirements of your true faith. Now the compact you have made respecting him is to renounce him, and his pomp, and his angels. Such is your agreement in this matter. Now the friendly understanding you will have to carry out must arise from your observance of the compact: you must never think of getting back any of the things which you have abjured, and have restored to him, lest he should summon you as a fraudulent man, and a transgressor of your agreement, before God the Judge (for in this light do we read of him, in another passage, as \"the accuser of the brethren,\"[fn-29-P2919_1024395:246-nf] or saints, where reference is made to the actual practice of legal prosecution); and lest this Judge deliver you over to the angel who is to execute the sentence, and he commit you to the prison of hell, out of which there will be no dismissal until the smallest even of your delinquencies be paid off in the period before the resurrection.[fn-29-P2920_1024757:247-nf] What can be a more fitting sense than this? What a truer interpretation? If, however, according to Carpocrates, the soul is bound to the commission of all sorts of crime and evil conduct, what must we from his system understand to be its \"adversary\" and foe? I suppose it must be that better mind which shall compel it by force to the performance of some act of virtue, that it may be driven from body to body, until it be found in none a debtor to the claims of a virtuous life. This means, that a good tree is known by its bad fruit-in other words, that the doctrine of truth is understood from the worst possible precepts. I apprehend[fn-29-P2921_1025621:248-nf] that heretics of this school seize with especial avidity the example of Elias, whom they assume to have been so reproduced in John (the Baptist) as to make our Lord's statement sponsor for their theory of transmigration, when He said, \"Elias is come already, and they knew him not; \"[fn-29-P2922_1025919:249-nf] and again, in another passage, \"And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.\"[fn-29-P2923_1026040:250-nf] Well, then, was it really in a Pythagorean sense that the Jews approached John with the inquiry, \"Art thou Elias? \"[fn-29-P2924_1026177:251-nf] and not rather in the sense of the divine prediction, \"Behold, I will send you Elijah\" the Tisbite?[fn-29-P2925_1026297:252-nf] The fact, however, is, that their metempsychosis, or transmigration theory, signifies the recall of the soul which had died long before, and its return to some other body. But Elias is to come again, not after quitting life (in the way of dying), but after his translation (or removal without dying); not for the purpose of being restored to the body, from which he had not departed, but for the purpose of revisiting the world from which he was translated; not by way of resuming a life which he had laid aside, but of fulfilling prophecy,-really and truly the same man, both in respect of his name and designation, as well as of his unchanged humanity. How, therefore could John be Elias? You have your answer in the angel's announcement: \"And he shall go before the people,\" says he, \"in the spirit and power of Elias\"-not (observe) in his soul and his body. These substances are, in fact, the natural property of each individual; whilst \"the spirit and power\" are bestowed as external gifts by the grace of God and so may be transferred to another person according to the purpose and will of the Almighty, as was anciently the case with respect to the spirit of Moses.[fn-29-P2926_1027489:253-nf] ","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_13_book_i_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"183","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"162.

These times and these men are indicated by the apostle, when he says, \"But they that will be rich, fall into temptation, and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and in perdition.

But a good which is wholly without evil is a perfect good. A good, on the other hand, which contains evil is a faulty or imperfect good; and there can be no evil where there is no good. From all this we arrive at the curious result: that since every being, so far as it is a being, is good, when we say that a faulty being is an evil being, we just seem to say that what is good is evil, and that nothing but what is good can be evil, seeing that every being is good, and that no evil can exist except in a being. Nothing, then, can be evil except something which is good. And although this, when stated, seems to be a contradiction, yet the strictness of reasoning leaves us no escape from the conclusion.

Whoever, then, says, \"To be a man is an evil,\" or, \"To be wicked is a good,\" falls under the prophetic denunciation: \"Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil!\" For he condemns the work of God, which is the man, and praises the defect of man, which is the wickedness.

For it is plain that the apostles themselves have given an indulgence in the case of certain sins: take, for example, what the Apostle Paul says to those who are married: \"Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer: and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.\"[fn-25-P2585_1224137:162-nf] Now it is possible that it might not have been considered a sin to have intercourse with a spouse, not with a view to the procreation of children, which is the great blessing of marriage, but for the sake of carnal pleasure, and to save the incontinent from being led by their weakness into the deadly sin of fornication, or adultery, or another form of uncleanness which it is shameful even to name, and into which it is possible that they might be drawn by lust under the temptation of Satan. It is possible, I say, that this might not have been considered a sin, had the apostle not added: \"But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.\"[fn-25-P2586_1224811:163-nf] Who, then, can deny that it is a sin, when confessedly it is only by apostolic authority that permission is granted to those who do it? Another case of the same kind is where he says: \"Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?\"[fn-25-P2587_1225148:164-nf] And shortly afterwards: \"If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the Church. I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren? But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.\"[fn-25-P2588_1225519:165-nf] Now it might have been supposed in this case that it is not a sin to have a quarrel with another, that the only sin is in wishing to have it adjudicated upon outside the Church, had not the apostle immediately added: \"Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law with one another.\"[fn-25-P2589_1225850:166-nf] And lest any one should excuse himself by saying that he had a just cause, and was suffering wrong, and that he only wished the sentence of the judges to remove his wrong, the apostle immediately anticipates such thoughts and excuses, and says: \"Why do ye not rather take wrong? Why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?\" Thus bringing us back to our Lord's saying, \"If any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also;\"[fn-25-P2590_1226343:167-nf] and again, \"Of him that taketh away thy goods, ask them not again.\"[fn-25-P2591_1226431:168-nf] Therefore our Lord has forbidden His followers to go to law with other men about worldly affairs. And carrying out this principle, the apostle here declares that to do so is \"altogether a fault.\" But when, notwithstanding, he grants his permission to have Such cases between brethren decided in the Church, other brethren adjudicating, and only sternly forbids them to be carried outside the Church, it is manifest that here again an indulgence is extended to the infirmities of the weak. It is in view, then, of these sins, and others of the same sort, and of others again more trifling still, which consist of offenses in words and thought (as the Apostle James confesses, \"In many things we offend all\"[fn-25-P2592_1227157:169-nf] ), that we need to pray every day and often to the Lord, saying, \"Forgive us our debts,\" and to add in truth and sincerity, \"as we forgive our debtors.\"","title":"Introductory Notice","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_21_homily_xv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"For since the multitude was such as a multitude ever is,[fn-13-P1342_457625:3-nf] and consisted moreover of such as creep on the ground,[fn-13-P1343_457695:4-nf] He withdraws the choir of His disciples, and makes His discourse unto them: in His conversation with them providing that the rest also, who were yet very far from the level of His sayings, might find His lesson of self-denial no longer grievous unto them.

Cicero tells us that the laws recognize eight kinds of penalty,-damages, imprisonment, scourging, reparation,[fn-41-P4152_2282737:23-nf] disgrace, exile, death, slavery. Is there any one of these which may be compressed into a brevity proportioned to the rapid commission of the offence, so that no longer time may be spent in its punishment than in its perpetration, unless, perhaps, reparation? For this requires that the offender suffer what he did, as that clause of the law says, \"Eye for eye, tooth for tooth.\"[fn-41-P4153_2283231:24-nf] For certainly it is possible for an offender to lose his eye by the severity of legal retaliation in as brief a time as he deprived another of his eye by the cruelty of his own lawlessness. But if scourging be a reasonable penalty for kissing another man's wife, is not the fault of an instant visited with long hours of atonement, and the momentary delight punished with lasting pain? What shall we say of imprisonment? Must the criminal be confined only for so long a time as he spent on the offence for which he is committed? or is not a penalty of many years' confinement imposed on the slave who has provoked his master with a word, or has struck him a blow that is quickly over? And as to damages, disgrace, exile, slavery, which are commonly inflicted so as to admit of no relaxation or pardon, do not these resemble eternal punishments in so far as this short life allows a resemblance? For they are not eternal only because the life in which they are endured is not eternal; and yet the crimes which are punished with these most protracted sufferings are perpetrated in a very brief space of time. Nor is there any one who would suppose that the pains of punishment should occupy as short a time as the offense; or that murder, adultery, sacrilege, or any other crime, should be measured, not by the enormity of the injury or wickedness, but by the length of time spent in its perpetration. Then as to the award of death for any great crime, do the laws reckon the punishment to consist in the brief moment in which death is inflicted, or in this, that the offender is eternally banished from the society of the living? And just as the punishment of the first death cuts men off from this present mortal city, so does the punishment of the second death cut men off from that future immortal city. For as the laws of this present city do not provide for the executed criminal's return to it, so neither is he who is condemned to the second dearth recalled again to life everlasting. But if temporal sin is visited with eternal punishment, how, then, they say, is that true which your Christ says, \"With the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again?\"[fn-41-P4154_2285434:25-nf] and they do not observe that \"the same measure\" refers, not to an equal space of time, but to the retribution of evil or, in other words, to the law by which he, who has done evil suffers evil. Besides, these words could be appropriately understood as referring to the matter of which our Lord was speaking when He used them, viz., judgments and condemnation. Thus, if he who unjustly judges and condemns is himself justly judged and condemned, he receives \"with the same measure\" though not the same thing as he gave. For judgment he gave, and judgment he receives, though the judgment he gave was unjust, the judgment he receives just.","title":"Book XXI","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":32,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_28_the_second_epistle_of_clement","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"47","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Brethren, then, let us now at length repent, let us soberly turn to that which is good; for we are full of abundant folly and wickedness.

Nor could there be any discussion about His annulling[fn-56-P5643_1725409:373-nf] the Sabbath, if He had a right[fn-56-P5644_1725463:374-nf] to annul it. Moreover, He would have the right, if He belonged to the rival god; nor would it cause surprise to any one that He did what it was right for Him to do. Men's astonishment therefore arose from their opinion that it was improper for Him to proclaim the Creator to be God and yet to impugn His Sabbath. Now, that we may decide these several points first, lest we should be renewing them at every turn to meet each argument of our adversary which rests on some novel institution[fn-56-P5645_1725967:375-nf] of Christ, let this stand as a settled point, that discussion concerning the novel character of each institution ensued on this account, because as nothing was as yet advanced by Christ touching any new deity, so discussion thereon was inadmissible; nor could it be retorted, that from the very novelty of each several institution another deity was clearly enough demonstrated by Christ, inasmuch as it was plain that novelty was not in itself a characteristic to be wondered at in Christ, because it had been foretold by the Creator. And it would have been, of course, but right that a new[fn-56-P5646_1726602:376-nf] god should first be expounded, and his discipline be introduced afterwards; because it Would be the god that would impart authority to the discipline, and not the discipline to the god; except that (to be sure) it has happened that Marcion acquired his very perverse opinions not from a master, but his master from his opinion! All other points respecting the Sabbath I thus rule. If Christ interfered with[fn-56-P5647_1727023:377-nf] the Sabbath, He simply acted after the Creator's example; inasmuch as in the siege of the city of Jericho the carrying around the walls of the ark of the covenant for eight days running, and therefore on a Sabbath-day, actually[fn-56-P5648_1727271:378-nf] annulled the Sabbath, by the Creator's command-according to the opinion of those who think this of Christ in this passage of St. Luke, in their ignorance that neither Christ nor the Creator violated the Sabbath, as we shall by and by show. And yet the Sabbath was actually then broken[fn-56-P5649_1727575:379-nf] by Joshua,[fn-56-P5650_1727617:380-nf] so that the present charge might be alleged also against Christ. But even if, as being not the Christ of the Jews, He displayed a hatred against the Jews' most solemn day, He was only professedly following[fn-56-P5651_1727841:381-nf] the Creator, as being His Christ, in this very hatred of the Sabbath; for He exclaims by the mouth of Isaiah: \"Your new moons and your Sabbaths my soul hateth.\"[fn-56-P5652_1728031:382-nf] Now, in whatever sense these words were spoken, we know that an abrupt defence must, in a subject of this sort, be used in answer to an abrupt challenge. I shall now transfer the discussion to the very matter in which the teaching of Christ seemed to annul the Sabbath. The disciples had been hungry; on that the Sabbath day they had plucked some ears and rubbed them in their hands; by thus preparing their food, they had violated the holy day. Christ excuses them, and became their accomplice in breaking the Sabbath. The Pharisees bring the charge against Him. Marcion sophistically interprets the stages of the controversy (if I may call in the aid of the truth of my Lord to ridicule his arts), both in the scriptural record and in Christ's purpose.[fn-56-P5653_1728805:383-nf] For from the Creator's Scripture, and from the purpose of Christ, there is derived a colourable precedent[fn-56-P5654_1729263:384-nf] -as from the example of David, when he went into the temple on the Sabbath, and provided food by boldly breaking up the shew-bread.[fn-56-P5655_1729417:385-nf] Even he remembered that this privilege (I mean the dispensation from fasting) was allowed to the Sabbath from the very beginning, when the Sabbath-day itself was instituted. For although the Creator had forbidden that the manna should be gathered for two days, He yet permitted it on the one occasion only of the day before the Sabbath, in order that the yesterday's provision of food might free from fasting the feast of the following Sabbath-day. Good reason, therefore, had the Lord for pursuing the same principle in the annulling of the Sabbath (since that is the word which men will use); good reason, too, for expressing the Creator's will,[fn-56-P5656_1730104:386-nf] when He bestowed the privilege of not fasting on the Sabbath-day. In short, He would have then and there[fn-56-P5657_1730226:387-nf] put an end to the Sabbath, nay, to the Creator Himself, if He had commanded His disciples to fast on the Sabbath-day, contrary to the intention[fn-56-P5658_1730389:388-nf] of the Scripture and of the Creator's will. But because He did not directly defend[fn-56-P5659_1730487:389-nf] His disciples, but excuses them; because He interposes human want, as if deprecating censure; because He maintains the honour of the Sabbath as a day which is to be free from gloom rather than from work;[fn-56-P5660_1730723:390-nf] because he puts David and his companions on a level with His own disciples in their fault and their extenuation; because He is pleased to endorse[fn-56-P5661_1730908:391-nf] the Creator's indulgence:[fn-56-P5662_1731004:392-nf] because He is Himself good according to His example-is He therefore alien from the Creator? Then the Pharisees watch whether He would heal on the Sabbath-day,[fn-56-P5663_1731205:393-nf] that they might accuse Him-surely as a violator of the Sabbath, not as the propounder of a new god; for perhaps I might be content with insisting on all occasions on this one point, that another Christ[fn-56-P5664_1731426:394-nf] is nowhere proclaimed. The Pharisees, however, were in utter error concerning the law of the Sabbath, not observing that its terms were conditional, when it enjoined rest from labour, making certain distinctions of labour. For when it says of the Sabbath-day, \"In it thou shalt not do any work of thine,\"[fn-56-P5665_1731774:395-nf] by the word thine[fn-56-P5666_1731811:396-nf] it restricts the prohibition to human work-which every one performs in his own employment or business-and not to divine work. Now the work of healing or preserving is not proper to man, but to God. So again, in the law it says, \"Thou shalt not do any manner of work in it,\"[fn-56-P5667_1732452:397-nf] except what is to be done for any soul,[fn-56-P5668_1732512:398-nf] that is to say, in the matter of delivering the soul;[fn-56-P5669_1732887:399-nf] because what is God's work may be done by human agency for the salvation of the soul. By God, however, would that be done which the man Christ was to do, for He was likewise God.[fn-56-P5670_1733113:400-nf] Wishing, therefore, to initiate them into this meaning of the law by the restoration of the withered hand, He requires, \"Is it lawful on the Sabbath-days to do good, or not? to save life, or to destroy it? \"[fn-56-P5671_1733368:401-nf] In order that He might, whilst allowing that amount of work which He was about to perform for a soul,[fn-56-P5672_1733489:402-nf] remind them what works the law of the Sabbath forbade-even human works; and what it enjoined-even divine works, which might be done for the benefit of any soul,[fn-56-P5673_1733684:403-nf] He was called \"Lord of the Sabbath,\"[fn-56-P5674_1733755:404-nf] because He maintained[fn-56-P5675_1733796:405-nf] the Sabbath as His own institution. Now, even if He had annulled the Sabbath, He would have had the right to do so,[fn-56-P5676_1733929:406-nf] as being its Lord, (and) still more as He who instituted it. But He did not utterly destroy it, although its Lord, in order that it might henceforth be plain that the Sabbath was not broken[fn-56-P5677_1734134:407-nf] by the Creator, even at the time when the ark was carried around Jericho. For that was really[fn-56-P5678_1734330:408-nf] God's work, which He commanded Himself, and which He had ordered for the sake of the lives of His servants when exposed to the perils of war. Now, although He has in a certain place expressed an aversion of Sabbaths, by calling them your Sabbaths,[fn-56-P5679_1734589:409-nf] reckoning them as men's Sabbaths, not His own, because they were celebrated without the fear of God by a people full of iniquities, and loving God \"with the lip, not the heart,\"[fn-56-P5680_1734790:410-nf] He has yet put His own Sabbaths (those, that is, which were kept according to His prescription) in a different position; for by the same prophet, in a later passage,[fn-56-P5681_1734978:411-nf] He declared them to be \"true, and delightful, and inviolable.\" Thus Christ did not at all rescind the Sabbath: He kept the law thereof, and both in the former case did a work which was beneficial to the life of His disciples, for He indulged them with the relief of food when they were hungry, and in the present instance cured the withered hand; in each case intimating by facts, \"I came not to destroy, the law, but to fulfil it,\"[fn-56-P5682_1735446:412-nf] although Marcion has gagged[fn-56-P5683_1735494:413-nf] His mouth by this word.[fn-56-P5684_1735536:414-nf] For even in the case before us He fulfilled the law, while interpreting its condition; moreover, He exhibits in a dear light the different kinds of work, while doing what the law excepts from the sacredness of the Sabbath[fn-56-P5685_1735925:415-nf] and while imparting to the Sabbath-day itself, which from the beginning had been consecrated by the benediction of the Father, an additional sanctity by His own beneficent action. For He furnished to this day divine safeguards,[fn-56-P5686_1736213:416-nf] -a course which[fn-56-P5687_1736247:417-nf] His adversary would have pursued for some other days, to avoid honouring the Creator's Sabbath, and restoring to the Sabbath the works which were proper for it. Since, in like manner, the prophet Elisha on this day restored to life the dead son of the Shunammite woman,[fn-56-P5688_1736576:418-nf] you see, O Pharisee, and you too, O Marcion, how that it was proper employment for the Creator's Sabbaths of old[fn-56-P5689_1736716:419-nf] to do good, to save life, not to destroy it; how that Christ introduced nothing new, which was not after the example,[fn-56-P5690_1736847:420-nf] the gentleness, the mercy, and the prediction also of the Creator. For in this very example He fulfils[fn-56-P5691_1736964:421-nf] the prophetic announcement of a specific healing: \"The weak hands are strengthened,\" as were also \"the feeble knees\"[fn-56-P5692_1737102:422-nf] in the sick of the palsy.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"72","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Concerning the Sabbath also I have this to premise, that this question could not have arisen, if Christ did not publicly proclaim[fn-56-P5642_1725309:372-nf] the Lord of the Sabbath.

Marcion sophistically interprets the stages of the controversy (if I may call in the aid of the truth of my Lord to ridicule his arts), both in the scriptural record and in Christ's purpose.[fn-56-P5653_1728805:383-nf] For from the Creator's Scripture, and from the purpose of Christ, there is derived a colourable precedent[fn-56-P5654_1729263:384-nf] -as from the example of David, when he went into the temple on the Sabbath, and provided food by boldly breaking up the shew-bread.[fn-56-P5655_1729417:385-nf] Even he remembered that this privilege (I mean the dispensation from fasting) was allowed to the Sabbath from the very beginning, when the Sabbath-day itself was instituted. For although the Creator had forbidden that the manna should be gathered for two days, He yet permitted it on the one occasion only of the day before the Sabbath, in order that the yesterday's provision of food might free from fasting the feast of the following Sabbath-day. Good reason, therefore, had the Lord for pursuing the same principle in the annulling of the Sabbath (since that is the word which men will use); good reason, too, for expressing the Creator's will,[fn-56-P5656_1730104:386-nf] when He bestowed the privilege of not fasting on the Sabbath-day. In short, He would have then and there[fn-56-P5657_1730226:387-nf] put an end to the Sabbath, nay, to the Creator Himself, if He had commanded His disciples to fast on the Sabbath-day, contrary to the intention[fn-56-P5658_1730389:388-nf] of the Scripture and of the Creator's will. But because He did not directly defend[fn-56-P5659_1730487:389-nf] His disciples, but excuses them; because He interposes human want, as if deprecating censure; because He maintains the honour of the Sabbath as a day which is to be free from gloom rather than from work;[fn-56-P5660_1730723:390-nf] because he puts David and his companions on a level with His own disciples in their fault and their extenuation; because He is pleased to endorse[fn-56-P5661_1730908:391-nf] the Creator's indulgence:[fn-56-P5662_1731004:392-nf] because He is Himself good according to His example-is He therefore alien from the Creator? Then the Pharisees watch whether He would heal on the Sabbath-day,[fn-56-P5663_1731205:393-nf] that they might accuse Him-surely as a violator of the Sabbath, not as the propounder of a new god; for perhaps I might be content with insisting on all occasions on this one point, that another Christ[fn-56-P5664_1731426:394-nf] is nowhere proclaimed. The Pharisees, however, were in utter error concerning the law of the Sabbath, not observing that its terms were conditional, when it enjoined rest from labour, making certain distinctions of labour. For when it says of the Sabbath-day, \"In it thou shalt not do any work of thine,\"[fn-56-P5665_1731774:395-nf] by the word thine[fn-56-P5666_1731811:396-nf] it restricts the prohibition to human work-which every one performs in his own employment or business-and not to divine work. Now the work of healing or preserving is not proper to man, but to God. So again, in the law it says, \"Thou shalt not do any manner of work in it,\"[fn-56-P5667_1732452:397-nf] except what is to be done for any soul,[fn-56-P5668_1732512:398-nf] that is to say, in the matter of delivering the soul;[fn-56-P5669_1732887:399-nf] because what is God's work may be done by human agency for the salvation of the soul. By God, however, would that be done which the man Christ was to do, for He was likewise God.[fn-56-P5670_1733113:400-nf] Wishing, therefore, to initiate them into this meaning of the law by the restoration of the withered hand, He requires, \"Is it lawful on the Sabbath-days to do good, or not? to save life, or to destroy it? \"[fn-56-P5671_1733368:401-nf] In order that He might, whilst allowing that amount of work which He was about to perform for a soul,[fn-56-P5672_1733489:402-nf] remind them what works the law of the Sabbath forbade-even human works; and what it enjoined-even divine works, which might be done for the benefit of any soul,[fn-56-P5673_1733684:403-nf] He was called \"Lord of the Sabbath,\"[fn-56-P5674_1733755:404-nf] because He maintained[fn-56-P5675_1733796:405-nf] the Sabbath as His own institution. Now, even if He had annulled the Sabbath, He would have had the right to do so,[fn-56-P5676_1733929:406-nf] as being its Lord, (and) still more as He who instituted it. But He did not utterly destroy it, although its Lord, in order that it might henceforth be plain that the Sabbath was not broken[fn-56-P5677_1734134:407-nf] by the Creator, even at the time when the ark was carried around Jericho. For that was really[fn-56-P5678_1734330:408-nf] God's work, which He commanded Himself, and which He had ordered for the sake of the lives of His servants when exposed to the perils of war. Now, although He has in a certain place expressed an aversion of Sabbaths, by calling them your Sabbaths,[fn-56-P5679_1734589:409-nf] reckoning them as men's Sabbaths, not His own, because they were celebrated without the fear of God by a people full of iniquities, and loving God \"with the lip, not the heart,\"[fn-56-P5680_1734790:410-nf] He has yet put His own Sabbaths (those, that is, which were kept according to His prescription) in a different position; for by the same prophet, in a later passage,[fn-56-P5681_1734978:411-nf] He declared them to be \"true, and delightful, and inviolable.\" Thus Christ did not at all rescind the Sabbath: He kept the law thereof, and both in the former case did a work which was beneficial to the life of His disciples, for He indulged them with the relief of food when they were hungry, and in the present instance cured the withered hand; in each case intimating by facts, \"I came not to destroy, the law, but to fulfil it,\"[fn-56-P5682_1735446:412-nf] although Marcion has gagged[fn-56-P5683_1735494:413-nf] His mouth by this word.[fn-56-P5684_1735536:414-nf] For even in the case before us He fulfilled the law, while interpreting its condition; moreover, He exhibits in a dear light the different kinds of work, while doing what the law excepts from the sacredness of the Sabbath[fn-56-P5685_1735925:415-nf] and while imparting to the Sabbath-day itself, which from the beginning had been consecrated by the benediction of the Father, an additional sanctity by His own beneficent action. For He furnished to this day divine safeguards,[fn-56-P5686_1736213:416-nf] -a course which[fn-56-P5687_1736247:417-nf] His adversary would have pursued for some other days, to avoid honouring the Creator's Sabbath, and restoring to the Sabbath the works which were proper for it. Since, in like manner, the prophet Elisha on this day restored to life the dead son of the Shunammite woman,[fn-56-P5688_1736576:418-nf] you see, O Pharisee, and you too, O Marcion, how that it was proper employment for the Creator's Sabbaths of old[fn-56-P5689_1736716:419-nf] to do good, to save life, not to destroy it; how that Christ introduced nothing new, which was not after the example,[fn-56-P5690_1736847:420-nf] the gentleness, the mercy, and the prediction also of the Creator. For in this very example He fulfils[fn-56-P5691_1736964:421-nf] the prophetic announcement of a specific healing: \"The weak hands are strengthened,\" as were also \"the feeble knees\"[fn-56-P5692_1737102:422-nf] in the sick of the palsy.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"72","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Concerning the Sabbath also I have this to premise, that this question could not have arisen, if Christ did not publicly proclaim[fn-56-P5642_1725309:372-nf] the Lord of the Sabbath. Nor could there be any discussion about His annulling[fn-56-P5643_1725409:373-nf] the Sabbath, if He had a right[fn-56-P5644_1725463:374-nf] to annul it. Moreover, He would have the right, if He belonged to the rival god; nor would it cause surprise to any one that He did what it was right for Him to do. Men's astonishment therefore arose from their opinion that it was improper for Him to proclaim the Creator to be God and yet to impugn His Sabbath. Now, that we may decide these several points first, lest we should be renewing them at every turn to meet each argument of our adversary which rests on some novel institution[fn-56-P5645_1725967:375-nf] of Christ, let this stand as a settled point, that discussion concerning the novel character of each institution ensued on this account, because as nothing was as yet advanced by Christ touching any new deity, so discussion thereon was inadmissible; nor could it be retorted, that from the very novelty of each several institution another deity was clearly enough demonstrated by Christ, inasmuch as it was plain that novelty was not in itself a characteristic to be wondered at in Christ, because it had been foretold by the Creator. And it would have been, of course, but right that a new[fn-56-P5646_1726602:376-nf] god should first be expounded, and his discipline be introduced afterwards; because it Would be the god that would impart authority to the discipline, and not the discipline to the god; except that (to be sure) it has happened that Marcion acquired his very perverse opinions not from a master, but his master from his opinion! All other points respecting the Sabbath I thus rule. If Christ interfered with[fn-56-P5647_1727023:377-nf] the Sabbath, He simply acted after the Creator's example; inasmuch as in the siege of the city of Jericho the carrying around the walls of the ark of the covenant for eight days running, and therefore on a Sabbath-day, actually[fn-56-P5648_1727271:378-nf] annulled the Sabbath, by the Creator's command-according to the opinion of those who think this of Christ in this passage of St. Luke, in their ignorance that neither Christ nor the Creator violated the Sabbath, as we shall by and by show. And yet the Sabbath was actually then broken[fn-56-P5649_1727575:379-nf] by Joshua,[fn-56-P5650_1727617:380-nf] so that the present charge might be alleged also against Christ. But even if, as being not the Christ of the Jews, He displayed a hatred against the Jews' most solemn day, He was only professedly following[fn-56-P5651_1727841:381-nf] the Creator, as being His Christ, in this very hatred of the Sabbath; for He exclaims by the mouth of Isaiah: \"Your new moons and your Sabbaths my soul hateth.\"[fn-56-P5652_1728031:382-nf] Now, in whatever sense these words were spoken, we know that an abrupt defence must, in a subject of this sort, be used in answer to an abrupt challenge. I shall now transfer the discussion to the very matter in which the teaching of Christ seemed to annul the Sabbath. The disciples had been hungry; on that the Sabbath day they had plucked some ears and rubbed them in their hands; by thus preparing their food, they had violated the holy day. Christ excuses them, and became their accomplice in breaking the Sabbath. The Pharisees bring the charge against Him. Marcion sophistically interprets the stages of the controversy (if I may call in the aid of the truth of my Lord to ridicule his arts), both in the scriptural record and in Christ's purpose.[fn-56-P5653_1728805:383-nf] For from the Creator's Scripture, and from the purpose of Christ, there is derived a colourable precedent[fn-56-P5654_1729263:384-nf] -as from the example of David, when he went into the temple on the Sabbath, and provided food by boldly breaking up the shew-bread.[fn-56-P5655_1729417:385-nf] Even he remembered that this privilege (I mean the dispensation from fasting) was allowed to the Sabbath from the very beginning, when the Sabbath-day itself was instituted. For although the Creator had forbidden that the manna should be gathered for two days, He yet permitted it on the one occasion only of the day before the Sabbath, in order that the yesterday's provision of food might free from fasting the feast of the following Sabbath-day. Good reason, therefore, had the Lord for pursuing the same principle in the annulling of the Sabbath (since that is the word which men will use); good reason, too, for expressing the Creator's will,[fn-56-P5656_1730104:386-nf] when He bestowed the privilege of not fasting on the Sabbath-day.

Then the Pharisees watch whether He would heal on the Sabbath-day,[fn-56-P5663_1731205:393-nf] that they might accuse Him-surely as a violator of the Sabbath, not as the propounder of a new god; for perhaps I might be content with insisting on all occasions on this one point, that another Christ[fn-56-P5664_1731426:394-nf] is nowhere proclaimed.

Now the work of healing or preserving is not proper to man, but to God. So again, in the law it says, \"Thou shalt not do any manner of work in it,\"[fn-56-P5667_1732452:397-nf] except what is to be done for any soul,[fn-56-P5668_1732512:398-nf] that is to say, in the matter of delivering the soul;[fn-56-P5669_1732887:399-nf] because what is God's work may be done by human agency for the salvation of the soul.

By God, however, would that be done which the man Christ was to do, for He was likewise God.[fn-56-P5670_1733113:400-nf] Wishing, therefore, to initiate them into this meaning of the law by the restoration of the withered hand, He requires, \"Is it lawful on the Sabbath-days to do good, or not? to save life, or to destroy it? \"[fn-56-P5671_1733368:401-nf] In order that He might, whilst allowing that amount of work which He was about to perform for a soul,[fn-56-P5672_1733489:402-nf] remind them what works the law of the Sabbath forbade-even human works; and what it enjoined-even divine works, which might be done for the benefit of any soul,[fn-56-P5673_1733684:403-nf] He was called \"Lord of the Sabbath,\"[fn-56-P5674_1733755:404-nf] because He maintained[fn-56-P5675_1733796:405-nf] the Sabbath as His own institution. Now, even if He had annulled the Sabbath, He would have had the right to do so,[fn-56-P5676_1733929:406-nf] as being its Lord, (and) still more as He who instituted it. But He did not utterly destroy it, although its Lord, in order that it might henceforth be plain that the Sabbath was not broken[fn-56-P5677_1734134:407-nf] by the Creator, even at the time when the ark was carried around Jericho. For that was really[fn-56-P5678_1734330:408-nf] God's work, which He commanded Himself, and which He had ordered for the sake of the lives of His servants when exposed to the perils of war. Now, although He has in a certain place expressed an aversion of Sabbaths, by calling them your Sabbaths,[fn-56-P5679_1734589:409-nf] reckoning them as men's Sabbaths, not His own, because they were celebrated without the fear of God by a people full of iniquities, and loving God \"with the lip, not the heart,\"[fn-56-P5680_1734790:410-nf] He has yet put His own Sabbaths (those, that is, which were kept according to His prescription) in a different position; for by the same prophet, in a later passage,[fn-56-P5681_1734978:411-nf] He declared them to be \"true, and delightful, and inviolable.\" Thus Christ did not at all rescind the Sabbath: He kept the law thereof, and both in the former case did a work which was beneficial to the life of His disciples, for He indulged them with the relief of food when they were hungry, and in the present instance cured the withered hand; in each case intimating by facts, \"I came not to destroy, the law, but to fulfil it,\"[fn-56-P5682_1735446:412-nf] although Marcion has gagged[fn-56-P5683_1735494:413-nf] His mouth by this word.[fn-56-P5684_1735536:414-nf] For even in the case before us He fulfilled the law, while interpreting its condition; moreover, He exhibits in a dear light the different kinds of work, while doing what the law excepts from the sacredness of the Sabbath[fn-56-P5685_1735925:415-nf] and while imparting to the Sabbath-day itself, which from the beginning had been consecrated by the benediction of the Father, an additional sanctity by His own beneficent action. For He furnished to this day divine safeguards,[fn-56-P5686_1736213:416-nf] -a course which[fn-56-P5687_1736247:417-nf] His adversary would have pursued for some other days, to avoid honouring the Creator's Sabbath, and restoring to the Sabbath the works which were proper for it. Since, in like manner, the prophet Elisha on this day restored to life the dead son of the Shunammite woman,[fn-56-P5688_1736576:418-nf] you see, O Pharisee, and you too, O Marcion, how that it was proper employment for the Creator's Sabbaths of old[fn-56-P5689_1736716:419-nf] to do good, to save life, not to destroy it; how that Christ introduced nothing new, which was not after the example,[fn-56-P5690_1736847:420-nf] the gentleness, the mercy, and the prediction also of the Creator. For in this very example He fulfils[fn-56-P5691_1736964:421-nf] the prophetic announcement of a specific healing: \"The weak hands are strengthened,\" as were also \"the feeble knees\"[fn-56-P5692_1737102:422-nf] in the sick of the palsy.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":5,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"72","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Concerning the Sabbath also I have this to premise, that this question could not have arisen, if Christ did not publicly proclaim[fn-56-P5642_1725309:372-nf] the Lord of the Sabbath. Nor could there be any discussion about His annulling[fn-56-P5643_1725409:373-nf] the Sabbath, if He had a right[fn-56-P5644_1725463:374-nf] to annul it. Moreover, He would have the right, if He belonged to the rival god; nor would it cause surprise to any one that He did what it was right for Him to do. Men's astonishment therefore arose from their opinion that it was improper for Him to proclaim the Creator to be God and yet to impugn His Sabbath. Now, that we may decide these several points first, lest we should be renewing them at every turn to meet each argument of our adversary which rests on some novel institution[fn-56-P5645_1725967:375-nf] of Christ, let this stand as a settled point, that discussion concerning the novel character of each institution ensued on this account, because as nothing was as yet advanced by Christ touching any new deity, so discussion thereon was inadmissible; nor could it be retorted, that from the very novelty of each several institution another deity was clearly enough demonstrated by Christ, inasmuch as it was plain that novelty was not in itself a characteristic to be wondered at in Christ, because it had been foretold by the Creator. And it would have been, of course, but right that a new[fn-56-P5646_1726602:376-nf] god should first be expounded, and his discipline be introduced afterwards; because it Would be the god that would impart authority to the discipline, and not the discipline to the god; except that (to be sure) it has happened that Marcion acquired his very perverse opinions not from a master, but his master from his opinion! All other points respecting the Sabbath I thus rule. If Christ interfered with[fn-56-P5647_1727023:377-nf] the Sabbath, He simply acted after the Creator's example; inasmuch as in the siege of the city of Jericho the carrying around the walls of the ark of the covenant for eight days running, and therefore on a Sabbath-day, actually[fn-56-P5648_1727271:378-nf] annulled the Sabbath, by the Creator's command-according to the opinion of those who think this of Christ in this passage of St. Luke, in their ignorance that neither Christ nor the Creator violated the Sabbath, as we shall by and by show. And yet the Sabbath was actually then broken[fn-56-P5649_1727575:379-nf] by Joshua,[fn-56-P5650_1727617:380-nf] so that the present charge might be alleged also against Christ. But even if, as being not the Christ of the Jews, He displayed a hatred against the Jews' most solemn day, He was only professedly following[fn-56-P5651_1727841:381-nf] the Creator, as being His Christ, in this very hatred of the Sabbath; for He exclaims by the mouth of Isaiah: \"Your new moons and your Sabbaths my soul hateth.\"[fn-56-P5652_1728031:382-nf] Now, in whatever sense these words were spoken, we know that an abrupt defence must, in a subject of this sort, be used in answer to an abrupt challenge. I shall now transfer the discussion to the very matter in which the teaching of Christ seemed to annul the Sabbath. The disciples had been hungry; on that the Sabbath day they had plucked some ears and rubbed them in their hands; by thus preparing their food, they had violated the holy day. Christ excuses them, and became their accomplice in breaking the Sabbath. The Pharisees bring the charge against Him. Marcion sophistically interprets the stages of the controversy (if I may call in the aid of the truth of my Lord to ridicule his arts), both in the scriptural record and in Christ's purpose.[fn-56-P5653_1728805:383-nf] For from the Creator's Scripture, and from the purpose of Christ, there is derived a colourable precedent[fn-56-P5654_1729263:384-nf] -as from the example of David, when he went into the temple on the Sabbath, and provided food by boldly breaking up the shew-bread.[fn-56-P5655_1729417:385-nf] Even he remembered that this privilege (I mean the dispensation from fasting) was allowed to the Sabbath from the very beginning, when the Sabbath-day itself was instituted. For although the Creator had forbidden that the manna should be gathered for two days, He yet permitted it on the one occasion only of the day before the Sabbath, in order that the yesterday's provision of food might free from fasting the feast of the following Sabbath-day. Good reason, therefore, had the Lord for pursuing the same principle in the annulling of the Sabbath (since that is the word which men will use); good reason, too, for expressing the Creator's will,[fn-56-P5656_1730104:386-nf] when He bestowed the privilege of not fasting on the Sabbath-day. In short, He would have then and there[fn-56-P5657_1730226:387-nf] put an end to the Sabbath, nay, to the Creator Himself, if He had commanded His disciples to fast on the Sabbath-day, contrary to the intention[fn-56-P5658_1730389:388-nf] of the Scripture and of the Creator's will. But because He did not directly defend[fn-56-P5659_1730487:389-nf] His disciples, but excuses them; because He interposes human want, as if deprecating censure; because He maintains the honour of the Sabbath as a day which is to be free from gloom rather than from work;[fn-56-P5660_1730723:390-nf] because he puts David and his companions on a level with His own disciples in their fault and their extenuation; because He is pleased to endorse[fn-56-P5661_1730908:391-nf] the Creator's indulgence:[fn-56-P5662_1731004:392-nf] because He is Himself good according to His example-is He therefore alien from the Creator? Then the Pharisees watch whether He would heal on the Sabbath-day,[fn-56-P5663_1731205:393-nf] that they might accuse Him-surely as a violator of the Sabbath, not as the propounder of a new god; for perhaps I might be content with insisting on all occasions on this one point, that another Christ[fn-56-P5664_1731426:394-nf] is nowhere proclaimed. The Pharisees, however, were in utter error concerning the law of the Sabbath, not observing that its terms were conditional, when it enjoined rest from labour, making certain distinctions of labour. For when it says of the Sabbath-day, \"In it thou shalt not do any work of thine,\"[fn-56-P5665_1731774:395-nf] by the word thine[fn-56-P5666_1731811:396-nf] it restricts the prohibition to human work-which every one performs in his own employment or business-and not to divine work. Now the work of healing or preserving is not proper to man, but to God. So again, in the law it says, \"Thou shalt not do any manner of work in it,\"[fn-56-P5667_1732452:397-nf] except what is to be done for any soul,[fn-56-P5668_1732512:398-nf] that is to say, in the matter of delivering the soul;[fn-56-P5669_1732887:399-nf] because what is God's work may be done by human agency for the salvation of the soul. By God, however, would that be done which the man Christ was to do, for He was likewise God.[fn-56-P5670_1733113:400-nf] Wishing, therefore, to initiate them into this meaning of the law by the restoration of the withered hand, He requires, \"Is it lawful on the Sabbath-days to do good, or not? to save life, or to destroy it? \"[fn-56-P5671_1733368:401-nf] In order that He might, whilst allowing that amount of work which He was about to perform for a soul,[fn-56-P5672_1733489:402-nf] remind them what works the law of the Sabbath forbade-even human works; and what it enjoined-even divine works, which might be done for the benefit of any soul,[fn-56-P5673_1733684:403-nf] He was called \"Lord of the Sabbath,\"[fn-56-P5674_1733755:404-nf] because He maintained[fn-56-P5675_1733796:405-nf] the Sabbath as His own institution. Now, even if He had annulled the Sabbath, He would have had the right to do so,[fn-56-P5676_1733929:406-nf] as being its Lord, (and) still more as He who instituted it. But He did not utterly destroy it, although its Lord, in order that it might henceforth be plain that the Sabbath was not broken[fn-56-P5677_1734134:407-nf] by the Creator, even at the time when the ark was carried around Jericho. For that was really[fn-56-P5678_1734330:408-nf] God's work, which He commanded Himself, and which He had ordered for the sake of the lives of His servants when exposed to the perils of war. Now, although He has in a certain place expressed an aversion of Sabbaths, by calling them your Sabbaths,[fn-56-P5679_1734589:409-nf] reckoning them as men's Sabbaths, not His own, because they were celebrated without the fear of God by a people full of iniquities, and loving God \"with the lip, not the heart,\"[fn-56-P5680_1734790:410-nf] He has yet put His own Sabbaths (those, that is, which were kept according to His prescription) in a different position; for by the same prophet, in a later passage,[fn-56-P5681_1734978:411-nf] He declared them to be \"true, and delightful, and inviolable.\" Thus Christ did not at all rescind the Sabbath: He kept the law thereof, and both in the former case did a work which was beneficial to the life of His disciples, for He indulged them with the relief of food when they were hungry, and in the present instance cured the withered hand; in each case intimating by facts, \"I came not to destroy, the law, but to fulfil it,\"[fn-56-P5682_1735446:412-nf] although Marcion has gagged[fn-56-P5683_1735494:413-nf] His mouth by this word.[fn-56-P5684_1735536:414-nf] For even in the case before us He fulfilled the law, while interpreting its condition; moreover, He exhibits in a dear light the different kinds of work, while doing what the law excepts from the sacredness of the Sabbath[fn-56-P5685_1735925:415-nf] and while imparting to the Sabbath-day itself, which from the beginning had been consecrated by the benediction of the Father, an additional sanctity by His own beneficent action. For He furnished to this day divine safeguards,[fn-56-P5686_1736213:416-nf] -a course which[fn-56-P5687_1736247:417-nf] His adversary would have pursued for some other days, to avoid honouring the Creator's Sabbath, and restoring to the Sabbath the works which were proper for it.

For in this very example He fulfils[fn-56-P5691_1736964:421-nf] the prophetic announcement of a specific healing: \"The weak hands are strengthened,\" as were also \"the feeble knees\"[fn-56-P5692_1737102:422-nf] in the sick of the palsy.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":12,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"74","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Surely to Sion He brings good tidings, and to Jerusalem peace and all blessings; He goes up into a mountain, and there spends a night in prayer,[fn-56-P5696_1737617:423-nf] and He is indeed heard by the Father.

Now, the same number of apostles was thus portended, as if they were to be fountains and rivers which should water the Gentile world, which was formerly dry and destitute of knowledge (as He says by Isaiah: \"I will put streams in the unwatered ground\"[fn-57-P5712_1740307:439-nf] ); as if they were to be gems to shed lustre upon the church's sacred robe, which Christ, the High Priest of the Father, puts on; as if, also, they were to be stones massive in their faith, which the true Joshua took out of the layer of the Jordan, and placed in the sanctuary of His covenant. What equally good defence of such a number has Marcion's Christ to show? It is impossible that anything can be shown to have been done by him unconnectedly,[fn-57-P5713_1740782:440-nf] which cannot be shown to have been done by my Christ in connection (with preceding types).[fn-57-P5714_1740954:441-nf] To him will appertain the event[fn-57-P5715_1741010:442-nf] in whom is discovered the preparation for the same.[fn-57-P5716_1741074:443-nf] Again, He changes the name of Simon to peter,[fn-57-P5717_1741145:444-nf] inasmuch as the Creator also altered the names of Abram, and Sarai, and Oshea, by calling the latter Joshua, and adding a syllable to each of the former. But why Peter? If it was because of the vigour of his faith, there were many solid materials which might lend a name from their strength. Was it because Christ was both a rock and a stone? For we read of His being placed \"for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence.\"[fn-57-P5718_1741613:445-nf] I omit the rest of the passage.[fn-57-P5719_1741694:446-nf] Therefore He would fain[fn-57-P5720_1741734:447-nf] impart to the dearest of His disciples a name which was suggested by one of His own especial designations in figure; because it was, I suppose, more peculiarly fit than a name which might have been derived from no figurative description of Himself.[fn-57-P5721_1742002:448-nf] There come to Him from Tyre, and from other districts even, a transmarine multitude. This fact the psalm had in view: \"And behold tribes of foreign people, and Tyre, and the people of the Ethiopians; they were there.

It is impossible that anything can be shown to have been done by him unconnectedly,[fn-57-P5713_1740782:440-nf] which cannot be shown to have been done by my Christ in connection (with preceding types).[fn-57-P5714_1740954:441-nf] To him will appertain the event[fn-57-P5715_1741010:442-nf] in whom is discovered the preparation for the same.[fn-57-P5716_1741074:443-nf] Again, He changes the name of Simon to peter,[fn-57-P5717_1741145:444-nf] inasmuch as the Creator also altered the names of Abram, and Sarai, and Oshea, by calling the latter Joshua, and adding a syllable to each of the former. But why Peter? If it was because of the vigour of his faith, there were many solid materials which might lend a name from their strength. Was it because Christ was both a rock and a stone? For we read of His being placed \"for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence.\"[fn-57-P5718_1741613:445-nf] I omit the rest of the passage.[fn-57-P5719_1741694:446-nf] Therefore He would fain[fn-57-P5720_1741734:447-nf] impart to the dearest of His disciples a name which was suggested by one of His own especial designations in figure; because it was, I suppose, more peculiarly fit than a name which might have been derived from no figurative description of Himself.[fn-57-P5721_1742002:448-nf] There come to Him from Tyre, and from other districts even, a transmarine multitude. This fact the psalm had in view: \"And behold tribes of foreign people, and Tyre, and the people of the Ethiopians; they were there. Sion is my mother, shall a man say; and in her was born a man\" (forasmuch as the God-man was born), and He built her by the Father's will; that you may know how Gentiles then flocked to Him, because He was born the God-man who was to build the church according to the Father's will-even of other races also.[fn-57-P5722_1742668:449-nf] So says Isaiah too: \"Behold, these come from far; and these from the north and from the west;[fn-57-P5723_1742817:450-nf] and these from the land of the Persians.\"[fn-57-P5724_1742872:451-nf] Concerning whom He says again: \"Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold, all these have gathered themselves together.\"[fn-57-P5725_1743016:452-nf] And yet again: \"Thou seest these unknown and strange ones; and thou wilt say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these? But who hath brought me up these? And these, where have they been? \"[fn-57-P5726_1743228:453-nf] Will such a Christ not be (the Christ) of the prophets?

Therefore the Creator, in foretelling matters for laughter and tears, was the first who said that those who mourned should laugh. Accordingly, He who began (His course) with consolation for the poor, and the humble, and the hungry, and the weeping, was at once eager[fn-57-P5760_1751437:483-nf] to represent Himself as Him whom He had pointed out by the mouth of Isaiah: \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the poor.\"[fn-57-P5761_1751633:484-nf] \"Blessed are the needy, because theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\"[fn-57-P5762_1751719:485-nf] \"He hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted.\"[fn-57-P5763_1751788:486-nf] \"Blessed are they that hunger, for they shall be filled.\"[fn-57-P5764_1751866:487-nf] \"To comfort all that mourn.\"[fn-57-P5765_1751915:488-nf] \"Blessed are they that weep, for they shall laugh.\"[fn-57-P5766_1751987:489-nf] \"To give unto them that mourn in Sion, beauty (or glory) for ashes, and the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.\"[fn-57-P5767_1752164:490-nf] Now since Christ, as soon as He entered on His course,[fn-57-P5768_1752239:491-nf] fulfilled such a ministration as this, He is either, Himself, He who predicted His own coming to do all this; or else if he is not yet come who predicted this, the charge to Marcion's Christ must be a ridiculous one (although I should perhaps add a necessary[fn-57-P5769_1752522:492-nf] one), which bade him say, \"Blessed shall ye be, when men shall bate you, and shall reproach you, and shall cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.\"[fn-57-P5770_1752754:493-nf] In this declaration there is, no doubt, an exhortation to patience. Well, what did the Creator say otherwise by Isaiah? \"Fear ye not the reproach of men, nor be diminished by their contempt.\"[fn-57-P5771_1752966:494-nf] What reproach? what contempt? That which was to be incurred for the sake of the Son of man. What Son of man? He who (is come) according to the Creator's will. Whence shall we get our proof? From the very cutting off, which was predicted against Him; as when He says by Isaiah to the Jews, who were the instigators of hatred against Him: \"Because of you, my name is blasphemed amongst the Gentiles; \"[fn-57-P5772_1753400:495-nf] and in another passage: \"Lay the penalty on[fn-57-P5773_1753464:496-nf] Him who surrenders[fn-57-P5774_1753499:497-nf] His own life, who is held in contempt by the Gentiles, whether servants or magistrates.\"[fn-57-P5775_1753610:498-nf] Now, since hatred was predicted against that Son of man who has His mission from the Creator, whilst the Gospel testifies that the name of Christians, as derived from Christ, was to be hated for the Son of man's sake, because He is Christ, it determines the point that that was the Son of man in the matter of hatred who came according to the Creator's purpose, and against whom the hatred was predicted.

From usury and injustice shall He redeem their souls, and in His sight shall their name be honoured.\"[fn-57-P5741_1746542:464-nf] Again: \"The wicked shall be turned into hell, even all the nations that forget God; because the needy shall not alway be forgotten; the endurance of the poor shall not perish for ever.\"[fn-57-P5742_1746758:465-nf] Again: \"Who is like unto the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high, and yet looketh on the humble things that are in heaven and on earth!-who raiseth up the needy from off the ground, and out of the dunghill exalteth the poor; that He may set him with the princes of His people,\"[fn-57-P5743_1747058:466-nf] that is, in His own kingdom. And likewise earlier, in the book of Kings,[fn-57-P5744_1747154:467-nf] Hannah the mother of Samuel gives glory to God in these words: \"He raiseth the poor man from the ground, and the beggar, that He may set him amongst the princes of His people (that is, in His own kingdom), and on thrones of glory\" (even royal ones).[fn-57-P5745_1747472:468-nf] And by Isaiah how He inveighs against the oppressors of the needy \"What mean ye that ye set fire to my vineyard, and that the spoil of the poor is in your houses? Wherefore do ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the face of the needy? \"[fn-57-P5746_1747733:469-nf] And again: \"Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees; for in their decrees they decree wickedness, turning aside the needy from judgment, and taking away their rights from the poor of my people.\"[fn-57-P5747_1747959:470-nf] These righteous judgments He requires for the fatherless also, and the widows, as well as for consolation[fn-57-P5748_1748086:471-nf] to the very needy themselves. \"Do justice to the fatherless, and deal justly with the widow; and come, let us be reconciled,[fn-57-P5749_1748227:472-nf] saith the Lord.\"[fn-57-P5750_1748356:473-nf] To him, for whom in every stage of lowliness there is provided so much of the Creator's compassionate regard, shall be given that kingdom also which is promised by Christ, to whose merciful compassion belong, and for a great while have belonged,[fn-57-P5751_1748625:474-nf] those to whom the promise is made. For even if you suppose that the promises of the Creator were earthly, but that Christ's are heavenly, it is quite clear that heaven has been as yet the property of no other God whatever, than Him who owns the earth also; quite clear that the Creator has given even the lesser promises (of earthly blessing), in order that I may more readily believe Him concerning His greater promises (of heavenly blessings) also, than (Marcion's god), who has never given proof of his liberality by any preceding bestowal of minor blessings. \"Blessed are they that hunger, for they shall be filled.\"[fn-57-P5752_1749273:475-nf] I might connect this clause with the former one, because none but the poor and needy suffer hunger, if the Creator had not specially designed that the promise of a similar blessing should serve as a preparation for the gospel, that so men might know it to be His.[fn-57-P5753_1749557:476-nf] For thus does He say, by Isaiah, concerning those whom He was about to call from the ends of the earth-that is, the Gentiles: \"Behold, they shall come swiftly with speed: \"[fn-57-P5754_1749779:477-nf] swiftly, because hastening towards the fulness of the times; with speed, because unclogged by the weights of the ancient law. They shall neither hunger nor thirst. Therefore they shall be filled,-a promise which is made to none but those who hunger and thirst. And again He says: \"Behold, my servants shall be filled, but ye shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty.\"[fn-57-P5755_1750199:478-nf] As for these oppositions, we shall see whether they are not premonitors of Christ.[fn-57-P5756_1750303:479-nf] Meanwhile the promise of fulness to the hungry is a provision of God the Creator. \"Blessed are they that weep, for they shall laugh.\"[fn-57-P5757_1750473:480-nf] Turn again to the passage of Isaiah: \"Behold, my servants shall exult with joy, but ye shall be ashamed; behold, my servants shall be glad, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart.\"[fn-57-P5758_1750672:481-nf] And recognise these oppositions also in the dispensation of Christ. Surely gladness and joyous exultation is promised to those who are in an opposite condition-to the sorrowful, and sad, and anxious. Just as it is said in the 125th Psalm: \"They who sow in tears shall reap in joy.\"[fn-57-P5759_1750979:482-nf] Moreover, laughter is as much an accessory to the exulting and glad, as weeping is to the sorrowful and grieving. Therefore the Creator, in foretelling matters for laughter and tears, was the first who said that those who mourned should laugh. Accordingly, He who began (His course) with consolation for the poor, and the humble, and the hungry, and the weeping, was at once eager[fn-57-P5760_1751437:483-nf] to represent Himself as Him whom He had pointed out by the mouth of Isaiah: \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the poor.\"[fn-57-P5761_1751633:484-nf] \"Blessed are the needy, because theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\"[fn-57-P5762_1751719:485-nf] \"He hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted.\"[fn-57-P5763_1751788:486-nf] \"Blessed are they that hunger, for they shall be filled.\"[fn-57-P5764_1751866:487-nf] \"To comfort all that mourn.\"[fn-57-P5765_1751915:488-nf] \"Blessed are they that weep, for they shall laugh.\"[fn-57-P5766_1751987:489-nf] \"To give unto them that mourn in Sion, beauty (or glory) for ashes, and the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.\"[fn-57-P5767_1752164:490-nf] Now since Christ, as soon as He entered on His course,[fn-57-P5768_1752239:491-nf] fulfilled such a ministration as this, He is either, Himself, He who predicted His own coming to do all this; or else if he is not yet come who predicted this, the charge to Marcion's Christ must be a ridiculous one (although I should perhaps add a necessary[fn-57-P5769_1752522:492-nf] one), which bade him say, \"Blessed shall ye be, when men shall bate you, and shall reproach you, and shall cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.\"[fn-57-P5770_1752754:493-nf] In this declaration there is, no doubt, an exhortation to patience. Well, what did the Creator say otherwise by Isaiah? \"Fear ye not the reproach of men, nor be diminished by their contempt.\"[fn-57-P5771_1752966:494-nf] What reproach? what contempt? That which was to be incurred for the sake of the Son of man. What Son of man? He who (is come) according to the Creator's will. Whence shall we get our proof? From the very cutting off, which was predicted against Him; as when He says by Isaiah to the Jews, who were the instigators of hatred against Him: \"Because of you, my name is blasphemed amongst the Gentiles; \"[fn-57-P5772_1753400:495-nf] and in another passage: \"Lay the penalty on[fn-57-P5773_1753464:496-nf] Him who surrenders[fn-57-P5774_1753499:497-nf] His own life, who is held in contempt by the Gentiles, whether servants or magistrates.\"[fn-57-P5775_1753610:498-nf] Now, since hatred was predicted against that Son of man who has His mission from the Creator, whilst the Gospel testifies that the name of Christians, as derived from Christ, was to be hated for the Son of man's sake, because He is Christ, it determines the point that that was the Son of man in the matter of hatred who came according to the Creator's purpose, and against whom the hatred was predicted.

Now the destroyer, now the advocate of the prophets! He destroyed them as their rival, by converting their disciples; he took up their cause as their friend, by stigmatizing[fn-57-P5783_1755146:503-nf] their persecutors. But,[fn-57-P5784_1755189:504-nf] in as far as the defence of the prophets could not be consistent in the Christ of Marcion, who came to destroy them; in so far is it becoming to the Creator's Christ that He should stigmatize those who persecuted the prophets, for He in all things accomplished their predictions. Again, it is more characteristic of the Creator to upbraid sons with their fathers' sins, than it is of that god who chastizes no man for even his own misdeeds. But you will say, He cannot be regarded as defending the prophets simply because He wished to affirm the iniquity of the Jews for their impious dealings with their own prophets. Well, then, in this case,[fn-57-P5785_1755848:505-nf] no sin ought to have been charged against the Jews: they were rather deserving of praise and approbation when they maltreated[fn-57-P5786_1755986:506-nf] those whom the absolutely good god of Marcion, after so long a time, bestirred himself[fn-57-P5787_1756162:507-nf] to destroy. I suppose, however, that by this time he bad ceased to be the absolutely good god;[fn-57-P5788_1756275:508-nf] he had now sojourned a considerable while even with the Creator, and was no longer (like) the god of Epicurus[fn-57-P5789_1756406:509-nf] purely and simply. For see how he condescends[fn-57-P5790_1756520:510-nf] to curse, and proves himself capable of taking offence and feeling anger! He actually pronounces a woe! But a doubt is raised against us as to the import of this word, as if it carried with it less the sense of a curse than of an admonition. Where, however, is the difference, since even an admonition is not given without the sting of a threat, especially when it is embittered with a woe? Moreover, both admonition and threatening will be the resources of him[fn-57-P5791_1756998:511-nf] who knows how to feel angry, For no one will forbid the doing of a thing with an admonition or a threat, except him who will inflict punishment for the doing of it. No one would inflict punishment, except him who was susceptible of anger. Others, again, admit that the word implies a curse; but they will have it that Christ pronounced the woe, not as if it were His own genuine feeling, but because the woe is from the Creator, and He wanted to set forth to them the severity of the Creator in order that He might the more commend His own long-suffering[fn-57-P5792_1757572:512-nf] in His beatitudes Just as if it were not competent to the Creator, in the pre-eminence of both His attributes as the good God and Judge, that, as He had made clemency[fn-57-P5793_1757760:513-nf] the preamble of His benediction so He should place severity in the sequel of His curses; thus fully developing His discipline in both directions, both in following out the blessing and in providing against the curse.[fn-57-P5794_1757998:514-nf] He had already said of old, \"Behold, I have set before you blessing and cursing.\"[fn-57-P5795_1758118:515-nf] Which statement was really a presage of[fn-57-P5796_1758180:516-nf] this temper of the gospel. Besides, what sort of being is that who, to insinuate a belief in his own goodness, invidiously contrasted[fn-57-P5797_1758337:517-nf] with it the Creator's severity? Of little worth is the recommendation which has for its prop the defamation of another. And yet by thus setting forth the severity of the Creator, he, in fact, affirmed Him to be an object of fear.[fn-57-P5798_1758584:518-nf] Now if He be an object of fear, He is of course more worthy of being obeyed than slighted; and thus Marcion's Christ begins to teach favourably to the Creator's interests.[fn-57-P5799_1758773:519-nf] Then, on the admission above mentioned, since the woe which has regard to the rich is the Creator's, it follows that it is not Christ, but the Creator, who is angry with the rich; while Christ approves of[fn-58-P5800_1759002:520-nf] the incentives of the rich[fn-58-P5801_1759049:521-nf] -I mean, their pride, their pomp,[fn-58-P5802_1759106:522-nf] their love of the world, and their contempt of God, owing to which they deserve the woe of the Creator. But how happens it that the reprobation of the rich does not proceed from the same God who had just before expressed approbation of the poor? There is nobody but reprobates the opposite of that which he has approved. If, therefore, there be imputed to the Creator the woe pronounced against the rich, there must be claimed for Him also the promise of the blessing upon the poor; and thus the entire work of the Creator devolves on Christ.-If to Marcion's god there be ascribed the blessing of the poor, he must also have imputed to him the malediction of the rich; and thus will he become the Creator's equal,[fn-58-P5803_1759836:523-nf] both good and judicial; nor will there be left any room for that distinction whereby two gods are made; and when this distinction is removed, there will remain the verity which pronounces the Creator to be the one only God. Since, therefore, \"woe\" is a word indicative of malediction, or of some unusually austere[fn-58-P5804_1760177:524-nf] exclamation; and since it is by Christ uttered against the rich, I shall have to show that the Creator is also a despiser[fn-58-P5805_1760319:525-nf] of the rich, as I have shown Him to be the defender[fn-58-P5806_1760392:526-nf] of the poor, in order that I may prove Christ to be on the Creator's side in this matter, even when He enriched Solomon.[fn-58-P5807_1760533:527-nf] But with respect to this man, since, when a choice was left to him, he preferred asking for what he knew to be well-pleasing to God-even wisdom-he further merited the attainment of the riches, which he did not prefer. The endowing of a man indeed with riches, is not an incongruity to God, for by the help of riches even rich men are comforted and assisted; moreover, by them many a work of justice and charity is carried out. But yet there are serious faults[fn-58-P5808_1761019:528-nf] which accompany riches; and it is because of these that woes are denounced on the rich, even in the Gospel. \"Ye have received,\" says He, \"your consolation; \"[fn-58-P5809_1761191:529-nf] that is, of course, from their riches, in the pomps and vanities of the world which these purchase for them. Accordingly, in Deuteronomy, Moses says: \"Lest, when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, as well as thy silver and thy gold, thine heart be then lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God.\"[fn-58-P5810_1761634:530-nf] in similar terms, when king Hezekiah became proud of his treasures, and gloried in them rather than in God before those who had come on an embassy from Babylon,[fn-58-P5811_1761821:531-nf] (the Creator) breaks forth[fn-58-P5812_1761884:532-nf] against him by the mouth of Isaiah: \"Behold, the days come when all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store, shall be carried to Babylon.\"[fn-58-P5813_1762072:533-nf] So by Jeremiah likewise did He say: \"Let not the rich man glory in his riches but let him that glorieth even glory in the Lord.\"[fn-58-P5814_1762223:534-nf] Similarly against the daughters of Sion does He inveigh by Isaiah, when they were haughty through their pomp and the abundance of their riches,[fn-58-P5815_1762391:535-nf] just as in another passage He utters His threats against the proud and noble: \"Hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth, and down to it shall descend the illustrious, and the great, and the rich (this shall be Christ's `woe to the rich'); and man[fn-58-P5816_1762670:536-nf] shall be humbled,\" even he that exalts himself with riches; \"and the mighty man[fn-58-P5817_1762784:537-nf] shall be dishonoured,\" even he who is mighty from his wealth.[fn-58-P5818_1762858:538-nf] Concerning whom He says again: \"Behold, the Lord of hosts shall confound the pompous together with their strength: those that are lifted up shall be hewn down, and such as are lofty shall fall by the sword.\"[fn-58-P5819_1763085:539-nf] And who are these but the rich? Because they have indeed received their consolation, glory, and honour and a lofty position from their wealth. In Psalms 48 He also turns off our care from these and says: \"Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, and when his glory is increased: for when he shall die, he shall carry nothing away; nor shall his glory descend along with him.\"[fn-58-P5820_1763481:540-nf] So also in Psalms 61: \"Do not desire riches; and if they do yield you their lustre,[fn-58-P5821_1763590:541-nf] do not set your heart upon them.\"[fn-58-P5822_1763641:542-nf] Lastly, this very same woe is pronounced of old by Amos against the rich, who also abounded in delights. \"Woe unto them,\" says he, \"who sleep upon beds of ivory, and deliciously stretch themselves upon their couches; who eat the kids from the flocks of the goats, and sucking calves from the flocks of the heifers, while they chant to the sound of the viol; as if they thought they should continue long, and were not fleeting; who drink their refined wines, and anoint themselves with the costliest ointments.\"[fn-58-P5823_1764173:543-nf] Therefore, even if I could do nothing else than show that the Creator dissuades men from riches, without at the same time first condemning the rich, in the very same terms in which Christ also did, no one could doubt that, from the same authority, there was added a commination against the rich in that woe of Christ, from whom also had first proceeded the dissuasion against the material sin of these persons, that is, their riches. For such commination is the necessary sequel to such a dissuasive. He inflicts a woe also on \"the full, because they shall hunger; on those too which laugh now, because they shall mourn.\"[fn-58-P5824_1764816:544-nf] To these will correspond these opposites which occur, as we have seen above, in the benedictions of the Creator: \"Behold, my servants shall be full, but ye shall be hungry \"-even because ye have been filled; \"behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed\"[fn-58-P5825_1765105:545-nf] -even ye who shall mourn, who now are laughing. For as it is written in the psalm, \"They who sow in tears shall reap in joy,\"[fn-58-P5826_1765252:546-nf] so does it run in the Gospel: They who sow in laughter, that is, in joy, shall reap in tears. These principles did the Creator lay down of old; and Christ has renewed them, by simply bringing them into prominent view,[fn-58-P5827_1765491:547-nf] not by making any change in them. \"Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.\"[fn-58-P5828_1765648:548-nf] With equal stress does the Creator, by His prophet Isaiah, censure those who seek after human flattery and praise: \"O my people, they who call you happy mislead you, and disturb the paths of your feet.\"[fn-58-P5829_1765871:549-nf] In another passage He forbids all implicit trust in man, and likewise in the applause of man; as by the prophet Jeremiah: \"Cursed be the man that trusteth in man.\"[fn-58-P5830_1766056:550-nf] Whereas in Psalms 117 it is said: \"It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man; it is better to trust in the Lord than to place hope in princes.\"[fn-58-P5831_1766243:551-nf] Thus everything which is caught at by men is adjured by the Creator, down to their good words.[fn-58-P5832_1766364:552-nf] It is as much His property to condemn the praise and flattering words bestowed on the false prophets by their fathers, as to condemn their vexatious and persecuting treatment of the (true) prophets. As the injuries suffered by the prophets could not be imputed[fn-58-P5833_1766653:553-nf] to their own God, so the applause bestowed on the false prophets could not have been displeasing to any other god but the God of the true prophets.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":25,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"79","folder":"ANF-03","text":"\"In the like manner,\" says He,[fn-57-P5781_1754811:501-nf] \"did their fathers unto the prophets.\" What a turncoat[fn-57-P5782_1754886:502-nf] is Marcion's Christ!

Others, again, admit that the word implies a curse; but they will have it that Christ pronounced the woe, not as if it were His own genuine feeling, but because the woe is from the Creator, and He wanted to set forth to them the severity of the Creator in order that He might the more commend His own long-suffering[fn-57-P5792_1757572:512-nf] in His beatitudes Just as if it were not competent to the Creator, in the pre-eminence of both His attributes as the good God and Judge, that, as He had made clemency[fn-57-P5793_1757760:513-nf] the preamble of His benediction so He should place severity in the sequel of His curses; thus fully developing His discipline in both directions, both in following out the blessing and in providing against the curse.[fn-57-P5794_1757998:514-nf] He had already said of old, \"Behold, I have set before you blessing and cursing.\"[fn-57-P5795_1758118:515-nf] Which statement was really a presage of[fn-57-P5796_1758180:516-nf] this temper of the gospel. Besides, what sort of being is that who, to insinuate a belief in his own goodness, invidiously contrasted[fn-57-P5797_1758337:517-nf] with it the Creator's severity? Of little worth is the recommendation which has for its prop the defamation of another. And yet by thus setting forth the severity of the Creator, he, in fact, affirmed Him to be an object of fear.[fn-57-P5798_1758584:518-nf] Now if He be an object of fear, He is of course more worthy of being obeyed than slighted; and thus Marcion's Christ begins to teach favourably to the Creator's interests.[fn-57-P5799_1758773:519-nf] Then, on the admission above mentioned, since the woe which has regard to the rich is the Creator's, it follows that it is not Christ, but the Creator, who is angry with the rich; while Christ approves of[fn-58-P5800_1759002:520-nf] the incentives of the rich[fn-58-P5801_1759049:521-nf] -I mean, their pride, their pomp,[fn-58-P5802_1759106:522-nf] their love of the world, and their contempt of God, owing to which they deserve the woe of the Creator. But how happens it that the reprobation of the rich does not proceed from the same God who had just before expressed approbation of the poor? There is nobody but reprobates the opposite of that which he has approved. If, therefore, there be imputed to the Creator the woe pronounced against the rich, there must be claimed for Him also the promise of the blessing upon the poor; and thus the entire work of the Creator devolves on Christ.-If to Marcion's god there be ascribed the blessing of the poor, he must also have imputed to him the malediction of the rich; and thus will he become the Creator's equal,[fn-58-P5803_1759836:523-nf] both good and judicial; nor will there be left any room for that distinction whereby two gods are made; and when this distinction is removed, there will remain the verity which pronounces the Creator to be the one only God. Since, therefore, \"woe\" is a word indicative of malediction, or of some unusually austere[fn-58-P5804_1760177:524-nf] exclamation; and since it is by Christ uttered against the rich, I shall have to show that the Creator is also a despiser[fn-58-P5805_1760319:525-nf] of the rich, as I have shown Him to be the defender[fn-58-P5806_1760392:526-nf] of the poor, in order that I may prove Christ to be on the Creator's side in this matter, even when He enriched Solomon.[fn-58-P5807_1760533:527-nf] But with respect to this man, since, when a choice was left to him, he preferred asking for what he knew to be well-pleasing to God-even wisdom-he further merited the attainment of the riches, which he did not prefer. The endowing of a man indeed with riches, is not an incongruity to God, for by the help of riches even rich men are comforted and assisted; moreover, by them many a work of justice and charity is carried out. But yet there are serious faults[fn-58-P5808_1761019:528-nf] which accompany riches; and it is because of these that woes are denounced on the rich, even in the Gospel. \"Ye have received,\" says He, \"your consolation; \"[fn-58-P5809_1761191:529-nf] that is, of course, from their riches, in the pomps and vanities of the world which these purchase for them. Accordingly, in Deuteronomy, Moses says: \"Lest, when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, as well as thy silver and thy gold, thine heart be then lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God.\"[fn-58-P5810_1761634:530-nf] in similar terms, when king Hezekiah became proud of his treasures, and gloried in them rather than in God before those who had come on an embassy from Babylon,[fn-58-P5811_1761821:531-nf] (the Creator) breaks forth[fn-58-P5812_1761884:532-nf] against him by the mouth of Isaiah: \"Behold, the days come when all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store, shall be carried to Babylon.\"[fn-58-P5813_1762072:533-nf] So by Jeremiah likewise did He say: \"Let not the rich man glory in his riches but let him that glorieth even glory in the Lord.\"[fn-58-P5814_1762223:534-nf] Similarly against the daughters of Sion does He inveigh by Isaiah, when they were haughty through their pomp and the abundance of their riches,[fn-58-P5815_1762391:535-nf] just as in another passage He utters His threats against the proud and noble: \"Hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth, and down to it shall descend the illustrious, and the great, and the rich (this shall be Christ's `woe to the rich'); and man[fn-58-P5816_1762670:536-nf] shall be humbled,\" even he that exalts himself with riches; \"and the mighty man[fn-58-P5817_1762784:537-nf] shall be dishonoured,\" even he who is mighty from his wealth.[fn-58-P5818_1762858:538-nf] Concerning whom He says again: \"Behold, the Lord of hosts shall confound the pompous together with their strength: those that are lifted up shall be hewn down, and such as are lofty shall fall by the sword.\"[fn-58-P5819_1763085:539-nf] And who are these but the rich? Because they have indeed received their consolation, glory, and honour and a lofty position from their wealth. In Psalms 48 He also turns off our care from these and says: \"Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, and when his glory is increased: for when he shall die, he shall carry nothing away; nor shall his glory descend along with him.\"[fn-58-P5820_1763481:540-nf] So also in Psalms 61: \"Do not desire riches; and if they do yield you their lustre,[fn-58-P5821_1763590:541-nf] do not set your heart upon them.\"[fn-58-P5822_1763641:542-nf] Lastly, this very same woe is pronounced of old by Amos against the rich, who also abounded in delights. \"Woe unto them,\" says he, \"who sleep upon beds of ivory, and deliciously stretch themselves upon their couches; who eat the kids from the flocks of the goats, and sucking calves from the flocks of the heifers, while they chant to the sound of the viol; as if they thought they should continue long, and were not fleeting; who drink their refined wines, and anoint themselves with the costliest ointments.\"[fn-58-P5823_1764173:543-nf] Therefore, even if I could do nothing else than show that the Creator dissuades men from riches, without at the same time first condemning the rich, in the very same terms in which Christ also did, no one could doubt that, from the same authority, there was added a commination against the rich in that woe of Christ, from whom also had first proceeded the dissuasion against the material sin of these persons, that is, their riches. For such commination is the necessary sequel to such a dissuasive. He inflicts a woe also on \"the full, because they shall hunger; on those too which laugh now, because they shall mourn.\"[fn-58-P5824_1764816:544-nf] To these will correspond these opposites which occur, as we have seen above, in the benedictions of the Creator: \"Behold, my servants shall be full, but ye shall be hungry \"-even because ye have been filled; \"behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed\"[fn-58-P5825_1765105:545-nf] -even ye who shall mourn, who now are laughing. For as it is written in the psalm, \"They who sow in tears shall reap in joy,\"[fn-58-P5826_1765252:546-nf] so does it run in the Gospel: They who sow in laughter, that is, in joy, shall reap in tears. These principles did the Creator lay down of old; and Christ has renewed them, by simply bringing them into prominent view,[fn-58-P5827_1765491:547-nf] not by making any change in them. \"Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.\"[fn-58-P5828_1765648:548-nf] With equal stress does the Creator, by His prophet Isaiah, censure those who seek after human flattery and praise: \"O my people, they who call you happy mislead you, and disturb the paths of your feet.\"[fn-58-P5829_1765871:549-nf] In another passage He forbids all implicit trust in man, and likewise in the applause of man; as by the prophet Jeremiah: \"Cursed be the man that trusteth in man.\"[fn-58-P5830_1766056:550-nf] Whereas in Psalms 117 it is said: \"It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man; it is better to trust in the Lord than to place hope in princes.\"[fn-58-P5831_1766243:551-nf] Thus everything which is caught at by men is adjured by the Creator, down to their good words.[fn-58-P5832_1766364:552-nf] It is as much His property to condemn the praise and flattering words bestowed on the false prophets by their fathers, as to condemn their vexatious and persecuting treatment of the (true) prophets. As the injuries suffered by the prophets could not be imputed[fn-58-P5833_1766653:553-nf] to their own God, so the applause bestowed on the false prophets could not have been displeasing to any other god but the God of the true prophets.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":26,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"79","folder":"ANF-03","text":"\"In the like manner,\" says He,[fn-57-P5781_1754811:501-nf] \"did their fathers unto the prophets.\" What a turncoat[fn-57-P5782_1754886:502-nf] is Marcion's Christ! Now the destroyer, now the advocate of the prophets! He destroyed them as their rival, by converting their disciples; he took up their cause as their friend, by stigmatizing[fn-57-P5783_1755146:503-nf] their persecutors. But,[fn-57-P5784_1755189:504-nf] in as far as the defence of the prophets could not be consistent in the Christ of Marcion, who came to destroy them; in so far is it becoming to the Creator's Christ that He should stigmatize those who persecuted the prophets, for He in all things accomplished their predictions. Again, it is more characteristic of the Creator to upbraid sons with their fathers' sins, than it is of that god who chastizes no man for even his own misdeeds. But you will say, He cannot be regarded as defending the prophets simply because He wished to affirm the iniquity of the Jews for their impious dealings with their own prophets. Well, then, in this case,[fn-57-P5785_1755848:505-nf] no sin ought to have been charged against the Jews: they were rather deserving of praise and approbation when they maltreated[fn-57-P5786_1755986:506-nf] those whom the absolutely good god of Marcion, after so long a time, bestirred himself[fn-57-P5787_1756162:507-nf] to destroy. I suppose, however, that by this time he bad ceased to be the absolutely good god;[fn-57-P5788_1756275:508-nf] he had now sojourned a considerable while even with the Creator, and was no longer (like) the god of Epicurus[fn-57-P5789_1756406:509-nf] purely and simply. For see how he condescends[fn-57-P5790_1756520:510-nf] to curse, and proves himself capable of taking offence and feeling anger! He actually pronounces a woe! But a doubt is raised against us as to the import of this word, as if it carried with it less the sense of a curse than of an admonition. Where, however, is the difference, since even an admonition is not given without the sting of a threat, especially when it is embittered with a woe? Moreover, both admonition and threatening will be the resources of him[fn-57-P5791_1756998:511-nf] who knows how to feel angry, For no one will forbid the doing of a thing with an admonition or a threat, except him who will inflict punishment for the doing of it.

Well, but Christ plainly teaches a new kind of patience,[fn-58-P5841_1768076:558-nf] when He actually prohibits the reprisals which the Creator permitted in requiring \"an eye for an eye,[fn-58-P5842_1768296:559-nf] and a tooth for a tooth,\"[fn-58-P5843_1768491:560-nf] and bids us, on the contrary, \"to him who smiteth us on the one cheek, to offer the other also, and to give up our coat to him that taketh away our cloak.\"[fn-58-P5844_1768667:561-nf] No doubt these are supplementary additions by Christ, but they are quite in keeping with the teaching of the Creator.

When by Zechariah He commanded, \"Let none of you imagine evil against his brother,\"[fn-58-P5847_1769047:564-nf] He did not expressly include his neighbour; but then in another passage He says, \"Let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour.\"[fn-58-P5848_1769219:565-nf] He who counselled that an injury should be forgotten, was still more likely to counsel the patient endurance of it. But then, when He said, \"Vengeance is mine, and I will repay,\"[fn-58-P5849_1769421:566-nf] He thereby teaches that patience calmly waits for the infliction of vengeance. Therefore, inasmuch as it is incredible[fn-58-P5850_1769599:567-nf] that the same (God) should seem to require \"a tooth for a tooth and an eye for an eye,\" in return for an injury, who forbids not only all reprisals, but even a revengeful thought or recollection of an injury, in so far does it become plain to us in what sense He required \"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,\"-not, indeed, for the purpose of permitting the repetition of the injury by retaliating it, which it virtually prohibited when it forbade vengeance; but for the purpose of restraining the injury in the first instance, which it had forbidden on pain of retaliation or reciprocity;[fn-58-P5851_1770219:568-nf] so that every man, in view of the permission to inflict a second (or retaliatory) injury, might abstain from the commission of the first (or provocative) wrong. For He knows how much more easy it is to repress violence by the prospect of retaliation, than by the promise of (indefinite) vengeance. Both results, however, it was necessary to provide, in consideration of the nature and the faith of men, that the man who believed in God might expect vengeance from God, while he who had no faith (to restrain him) might fear the laws which prescribed retaliation.[fn-58-P5852_1770808:569-nf] This purpose[fn-58-P5853_1770881:570-nf] of the law, which it was difficult to understand, Christ, as the Lord of the Sabbath and of the law, and of all the dispensations of the Father, both revealed and made intelligible,[fn-58-P5854_1771082:571-nf] when He commanded that \"the other cheek should be offered (to the smiter),\" in order that He might the more effectually extinguish all reprisals of an injury, which the law had wished to prevent by the method of retaliation, (and) which most certainly revelation[fn-58-P5855_1771407:572-nf] had manifestly restricted, both by prohibiting the memory of the wrong, and referring the vengeance thereof to God. Thus, whatever (new provision) Christ introduced, He did it not in opposition to the law, but rather in furtherance of it, without at all impairing the prescription[fn-58-P5856_1771707:573-nf] of the Creator. If, therefore,[fn-58-P5857_1771773:574-nf] one looks carefully[fn-58-P5858_1771809:575-nf] into the very grounds for which patience is enjoined (and that to such a full and complete extent), one finds that it cannot stand if it is not the precept of the Creator, who promises vengeance, who presents Himself as the judge (in the case). If it were not so,[fn-58-P5859_1772143:576-nf] -if so vast a weight of patience-which is to refrain from giving blow for blow; which is to offer the other cheek; which is not only not to return railing for railing, but contrariwise blessing; and which, so far from keeping the coat, is to give up the cloak also-is laid upon me by one who means not to help me,-(then all I can say is, ) he has taught me patience to no purpose,[fn-58-P5860_1772541:577-nf] because he shows me no reward to his precept-I mean no fruit of such patience. There is revenge which he ought to have permitted me to take, if he meant not to inflict it himself; if he did not give me that permission, then he should himself have inflicted it;[fn-58-P5861_1772820:578-nf] since it is for the interest of discipline itself that an injury should be avenged. For by the fear of vengeance all iniquity is curbed. But if licence is allowed to it without discrimination,[fn-58-P5862_1773057:579-nf] it will get the mastery-it will put out (a man's) both eyes; it will knock out[fn-58-P5863_1773151:580-nf] every tooth in the safety of its impunity. This, however, is (the principle) of your good and simply beneficent god-to do a wrong to patience, to open the door to violence, to leave the righteous undefended, and the wicked unrestrained! \"Give to every one that asketh of thee\"[fn-58-P5864_1773447:581-nf] -to the indigent of course, or rather to the indigent more especially, although to the affluent likewise. But in order that no man may be indigent, you have in Deuteronomy a provision commanded by the Creator to the creditor.[fn-58-P5865_1773693:582-nf] \"There shall not be in thine hand an indigent man; so that the Lord thy God shall bless thee with blessings,\"[fn-58-P5866_1773818:583-nf] -thee meaning the creditor to whom it was owing that the man was not indigent. But more than this. To one who does not ask, He bids a gift to be given. \"Let there be, not,\" He says, \"a poor man in thine hand; \"in other words, see that there be not, so far as thy will can prevent;[fn-58-P5867_1774143:584-nf] by which command, too, He all the more strongly by inference requires[fn-58-P5868_1774239:585-nf] men to give to him that asks, as in the following words also: \"If there be among you a poor man of thy brethren, thou shalt not turn away thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother. But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him as much as he wanteth,\"[fn-58-P5869_1774549:586-nf] Loans are not usually given, except to such as ask for them. On this subject of lending,[fn-58-P5870_1774661:587-nf] however, more hereafter.[fn-58-P5871_1774704:588-nf] Now, should any one wish to argue that the Creator's precepts extended only to a man's brethren, but Christ's to all that ask, so as to make the latter a new and different precept, (I have to reply) that one rule only can be made out of those principles, which show the law of the Creator to be repeated in Christ.[fn-58-P5872_1775054:589-nf] For that is not a different thing which Christ enjoined to be done towards all men, from that which the Creator prescribed in favour of a man's brethren. For although that is a greater charity, which is shown to strangers, it is yet not preferable to that[fn-58-P5873_1775413:590-nf] which was previously due to one's neighbours. For what man will be able to bestow the love (which proceeds from knowledge of character,[fn-58-P5874_1775566:591-nf] upon strangers? Since, however, the second step[fn-58-P5875_1776029:592-nf] in charity is towards strangers, while the first is towards one's neighbours, the second step will belong to him to whom the first also belongs, more fitly than the second will belong to him who owned no first.[fn-58-P5876_1776255:593-nf] Accordingly, the Creator, when following the course of nature, taught in the first instance kindness to neighbours,[fn-58-P5877_1776404:594-nf] intending afterwards to enjoin it towards strangers; and when following the method of His dispensation, He limited charity first to the Jews, but afterwards extended it to the whole race of mankind. So long, therefore, as the mystery of His government[fn-58-P5878_1776676:595-nf] was confined to Israel, He properly commanded that pity should be shown only to a man's brethren; but when Christ had given to Him \"the Gentiles for His heritage, and the ends of the earth for His possession,\" then began to be accomplished what was said by Hosea: \"Ye are not my people, who were my people; ye have not obtained mercy, who once obtained mercy\"[fn-58-P5879_1777057:596-nf] -that is, the (Jewish) nation. Thenceforth Christ extended to all men the law of His Father's compassion, excepting none from His mercy, as He omitted none in His invitation. So that, whatever was the ampler scope of His teaching, He received it all in His heritage of the nations. \"And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.\"[fn-58-P5880_1777469:597-nf] In this command is no doubt implied its counterpart: \"And as ye would not that men should do to you, so should ye also not do to them likewise.\" Now, if this were the teaching of the new and previously unknown and not yet fully proclaimed deity, who had favoured me with no instruction beforehand, whereby I might first learn what I ought to choose or to refuse for myself, and to do to others what I would wish done to myself, not doing to them what I should be unwilling to have done to myself, it would certainly be nothing else than the chance-medley of my own sentiments[fn-58-P5881_1778065:598-nf] which he would have left to me, binding me to no proper rule of wish or action, in order that I might do to others what I would like for myself, or refrain from doing to others what I should dislike to have done to myself. For he has not, in fact, defined what I ought to wish or not to wish for myself as well as for others, so that I shape my conduct[fn-58-P5882_1778455:599-nf] according to the law of my own will, and have it in my power[fn-58-P5883_1778537:600-nf] not to render[fn-58-P5884_1778566:601-nf] to another what I would like to have rendered to myself-love, obedience, consolation, protection, and such like blessings; and in like manner to do to another what I should be unwilling to have done to myself-violence, wrong, insult, deceit, and evils of like sort. Indeed, the heathen who have not been instructed by God act on this incongruous liberty of the will and the conduct.[fn-58-P5885_1778967:602-nf] For although good and evil are severally known by nature, yet life is not thereby spent[fn-58-P5886_1779119:603-nf] under the discipline of God, which alone at last teaches men the proper liberty of their will and action in faith, asin the fear of God. The god of Marcion, therefore, although specially revealed, was, in spite of his revelation, unable to publish any summary of the precept in question, which had hitherto been so confined,[fn-58-P5887_1779463:604-nf] and obscure, and dark, and admitting of no ready interpretation, except according to my own arbitrary thought,[fn-58-P5888_1779591:605-nf] because he had provided no previous discrimination in the matter of such a precept. This, however, was not the case with my God[fn-58-P5889_1779744:606-nf] for He always and everywhere enjoined that the poor, and the orphan, and the widow should be protected, assisted, refreshed; thus by Isaiah He says: \"Deal thy bread to the hungry, and them that are houseless bring into thine house; when thou seest the naked, cover him.\"[fn-58-P5890_1780054:607-nf] By Ezekiel also He thus describes the just man: \"His bread will he give to the hungry, and the naked will he cover with a garment.\"[fn-58-P5891_1780208:608-nf] That teaching was even then a sufficient inducement to me to do to others what I would that they should do unto me. Accordingly, when He uttered such denunciations as, \"Thou shalt do no murder; thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness,\" He taught me to refrain from doing to others what I should be unwilling to have done to myself; and therefore the precept developed in the Gospel will belong to Him alone, who anciently drew it up, and gave it distinctive point, and arranged it after the decision of His own teaching, and has now reduced it, suitably to its importance,[fn-58-P5892_1780852:609-nf] to a compendious formula, because (as it was predicted in another passage) the Lord-that is, Christ\" was to make (or utter) a concise word on earth.\"[fn-58-P5893_1781017:610-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":29,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"81","folder":"ANF-03","text":"\"But I say unto you which hear\" (displaying here that old injunction, of the Creator: \"Speak to the ears of those who lend them to you\"[fn-58-P5837_1767307:554-nf] ), \"Love your enemies, and bless[fn-58-P5838_1767389:555-nf] those which hate you, and pray for them which calumniate you.\"[fn-58-P5839_1767528:556-nf] These commands the Creator included in one precept by His prophet Isaiah: \"Say, Ye are our brethren, to those who hate you.\"[fn-58-P5840_1767737:557-nf] For if they who are our enemies, and hate us, and speak evil of us, and calumniate us, are to be called our brethren, surely He did in effect bid us bless them that hate us, and pray for them who calumniate us, when He instructed us to reckon them as brethren. Well, but Christ plainly teaches a new kind of patience,[fn-58-P5841_1768076:558-nf] when He actually prohibits the reprisals which the Creator permitted in requiring \"an eye for an eye,[fn-58-P5842_1768296:559-nf] and a tooth for a tooth,\"[fn-58-P5843_1768491:560-nf] and bids us, on the contrary, \"to him who smiteth us on the one cheek, to offer the other also, and to give up our coat to him that taketh away our cloak.\"[fn-58-P5844_1768667:561-nf] No doubt these are supplementary additions by Christ, but they are quite in keeping with the teaching of the Creator.

But then, when He said, \"Vengeance is mine, and I will repay,\"[fn-58-P5849_1769421:566-nf] He thereby teaches that patience calmly waits for the infliction of vengeance. Therefore, inasmuch as it is incredible[fn-58-P5850_1769599:567-nf] that the same (God) should seem to require \"a tooth for a tooth and an eye for an eye,\" in return for an injury, who forbids not only all reprisals, but even a revengeful thought or recollection of an injury, in so far does it become plain to us in what sense He required \"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,\"-not, indeed, for the purpose of permitting the repetition of the injury by retaliating it, which it virtually prohibited when it forbade vengeance; but for the purpose of restraining the injury in the first instance, which it had forbidden on pain of retaliation or reciprocity;[fn-58-P5851_1770219:568-nf] so that every man, in view of the permission to inflict a second (or retaliatory) injury, might abstain from the commission of the first (or provocative) wrong. For He knows how much more easy it is to repress violence by the prospect of retaliation, than by the promise of (indefinite) vengeance. Both results, however, it was necessary to provide, in consideration of the nature and the faith of men, that the man who believed in God might expect vengeance from God, while he who had no faith (to restrain him) might fear the laws which prescribed retaliation.[fn-58-P5852_1770808:569-nf] This purpose[fn-58-P5853_1770881:570-nf] of the law, which it was difficult to understand, Christ, as the Lord of the Sabbath and of the law, and of all the dispensations of the Father, both revealed and made intelligible,[fn-58-P5854_1771082:571-nf] when He commanded that \"the other cheek should be offered (to the smiter),\" in order that He might the more effectually extinguish all reprisals of an injury, which the law had wished to prevent by the method of retaliation, (and) which most certainly revelation[fn-58-P5855_1771407:572-nf] had manifestly restricted, both by prohibiting the memory of the wrong, and referring the vengeance thereof to God. Thus, whatever (new provision) Christ introduced, He did it not in opposition to the law, but rather in furtherance of it, without at all impairing the prescription[fn-58-P5856_1771707:573-nf] of the Creator. If, therefore,[fn-58-P5857_1771773:574-nf] one looks carefully[fn-58-P5858_1771809:575-nf] into the very grounds for which patience is enjoined (and that to such a full and complete extent), one finds that it cannot stand if it is not the precept of the Creator, who promises vengeance, who presents Himself as the judge (in the case). If it were not so,[fn-58-P5859_1772143:576-nf] -if so vast a weight of patience-which is to refrain from giving blow for blow; which is to offer the other cheek; which is not only not to return railing for railing, but contrariwise blessing; and which, so far from keeping the coat, is to give up the cloak also-is laid upon me by one who means not to help me,-(then all I can say is, ) he has taught me patience to no purpose,[fn-58-P5860_1772541:577-nf] because he shows me no reward to his precept-I mean no fruit of such patience. There is revenge which he ought to have permitted me to take, if he meant not to inflict it himself; if he did not give me that permission, then he should himself have inflicted it;[fn-58-P5861_1772820:578-nf] since it is for the interest of discipline itself that an injury should be avenged. For by the fear of vengeance all iniquity is curbed. But if licence is allowed to it without discrimination,[fn-58-P5862_1773057:579-nf] it will get the mastery-it will put out (a man's) both eyes; it will knock out[fn-58-P5863_1773151:580-nf] every tooth in the safety of its impunity. This, however, is (the principle) of your good and simply beneficent god-to do a wrong to patience, to open the door to violence, to leave the righteous undefended, and the wicked unrestrained! \"Give to every one that asketh of thee\"[fn-58-P5864_1773447:581-nf] -to the indigent of course, or rather to the indigent more especially, although to the affluent likewise. But in order that no man may be indigent, you have in Deuteronomy a provision commanded by the Creator to the creditor.[fn-58-P5865_1773693:582-nf] \"There shall not be in thine hand an indigent man; so that the Lord thy God shall bless thee with blessings,\"[fn-58-P5866_1773818:583-nf] -thee meaning the creditor to whom it was owing that the man was not indigent. But more than this. To one who does not ask, He bids a gift to be given. \"Let there be, not,\" He says, \"a poor man in thine hand; \"in other words, see that there be not, so far as thy will can prevent;[fn-58-P5867_1774143:584-nf] by which command, too, He all the more strongly by inference requires[fn-58-P5868_1774239:585-nf] men to give to him that asks, as in the following words also: \"If there be among you a poor man of thy brethren, thou shalt not turn away thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother. But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him as much as he wanteth,\"[fn-58-P5869_1774549:586-nf] Loans are not usually given, except to such as ask for them. On this subject of lending,[fn-58-P5870_1774661:587-nf] however, more hereafter.[fn-58-P5871_1774704:588-nf] Now, should any one wish to argue that the Creator's precepts extended only to a man's brethren, but Christ's to all that ask, so as to make the latter a new and different precept, (I have to reply) that one rule only can be made out of those principles, which show the law of the Creator to be repeated in Christ.[fn-58-P5872_1775054:589-nf] For that is not a different thing which Christ enjoined to be done towards all men, from that which the Creator prescribed in favour of a man's brethren. For although that is a greater charity, which is shown to strangers, it is yet not preferable to that[fn-58-P5873_1775413:590-nf] which was previously due to one's neighbours. For what man will be able to bestow the love (which proceeds from knowledge of character,[fn-58-P5874_1775566:591-nf] upon strangers? Since, however, the second step[fn-58-P5875_1776029:592-nf] in charity is towards strangers, while the first is towards one's neighbours, the second step will belong to him to whom the first also belongs, more fitly than the second will belong to him who owned no first.[fn-58-P5876_1776255:593-nf] Accordingly, the Creator, when following the course of nature, taught in the first instance kindness to neighbours,[fn-58-P5877_1776404:594-nf] intending afterwards to enjoin it towards strangers; and when following the method of His dispensation, He limited charity first to the Jews, but afterwards extended it to the whole race of mankind. So long, therefore, as the mystery of His government[fn-58-P5878_1776676:595-nf] was confined to Israel, He properly commanded that pity should be shown only to a man's brethren; but when Christ had given to Him \"the Gentiles for His heritage, and the ends of the earth for His possession,\" then began to be accomplished what was said by Hosea: \"Ye are not my people, who were my people; ye have not obtained mercy, who once obtained mercy\"[fn-58-P5879_1777057:596-nf] -that is, the (Jewish) nation. Thenceforth Christ extended to all men the law of His Father's compassion, excepting none from His mercy, as He omitted none in His invitation. So that, whatever was the ampler scope of His teaching, He received it all in His heritage of the nations. \"And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.\"[fn-58-P5880_1777469:597-nf] In this command is no doubt implied its counterpart: \"And as ye would not that men should do to you, so should ye also not do to them likewise.\" Now, if this were the teaching of the new and previously unknown and not yet fully proclaimed deity, who had favoured me with no instruction beforehand, whereby I might first learn what I ought to choose or to refuse for myself, and to do to others what I would wish done to myself, not doing to them what I should be unwilling to have done to myself, it would certainly be nothing else than the chance-medley of my own sentiments[fn-58-P5881_1778065:598-nf] which he would have left to me, binding me to no proper rule of wish or action, in order that I might do to others what I would like for myself, or refrain from doing to others what I should dislike to have done to myself. For he has not, in fact, defined what I ought to wish or not to wish for myself as well as for others, so that I shape my conduct[fn-58-P5882_1778455:599-nf] according to the law of my own will, and have it in my power[fn-58-P5883_1778537:600-nf] not to render[fn-58-P5884_1778566:601-nf] to another what I would like to have rendered to myself-love, obedience, consolation, protection, and such like blessings; and in like manner to do to another what I should be unwilling to have done to myself-violence, wrong, insult, deceit, and evils of like sort. Indeed, the heathen who have not been instructed by God act on this incongruous liberty of the will and the conduct.[fn-58-P5885_1778967:602-nf] For although good and evil are severally known by nature, yet life is not thereby spent[fn-58-P5886_1779119:603-nf] under the discipline of God, which alone at last teaches men the proper liberty of their will and action in faith, asin the fear of God. The god of Marcion, therefore, although specially revealed, was, in spite of his revelation, unable to publish any summary of the precept in question, which had hitherto been so confined,[fn-58-P5887_1779463:604-nf] and obscure, and dark, and admitting of no ready interpretation, except according to my own arbitrary thought,[fn-58-P5888_1779591:605-nf] because he had provided no previous discrimination in the matter of such a precept. This, however, was not the case with my God[fn-58-P5889_1779744:606-nf] for He always and everywhere enjoined that the poor, and the orphan, and the widow should be protected, assisted, refreshed; thus by Isaiah He says: \"Deal thy bread to the hungry, and them that are houseless bring into thine house; when thou seest the naked, cover him.\"[fn-58-P5890_1780054:607-nf] By Ezekiel also He thus describes the just man: \"His bread will he give to the hungry, and the naked will he cover with a garment.\"[fn-58-P5891_1780208:608-nf] That teaching was even then a sufficient inducement to me to do to others what I would that they should do unto me. Accordingly, when He uttered such denunciations as, \"Thou shalt do no murder; thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness,\" He taught me to refrain from doing to others what I should be unwilling to have done to myself; and therefore the precept developed in the Gospel will belong to Him alone, who anciently drew it up, and gave it distinctive point, and arranged it after the decision of His own teaching, and has now reduced it, suitably to its importance,[fn-58-P5892_1780852:609-nf] to a compendious formula, because (as it was predicted in another passage) the Lord-that is, Christ\" was to make (or utter) a concise word on earth.\"[fn-58-P5893_1781017:610-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":31,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"81","folder":"ANF-03","text":"\"But I say unto you which hear\" (displaying here that old injunction, of the Creator: \"Speak to the ears of those who lend them to you\"[fn-58-P5837_1767307:554-nf] ), \"Love your enemies, and bless[fn-58-P5838_1767389:555-nf] those which hate you, and pray for them which calumniate you.\"[fn-58-P5839_1767528:556-nf] These commands the Creator included in one precept by His prophet Isaiah: \"Say, Ye are our brethren, to those who hate you.\"[fn-58-P5840_1767737:557-nf] For if they who are our enemies, and hate us, and speak evil of us, and calumniate us, are to be called our brethren, surely He did in effect bid us bless them that hate us, and pray for them who calumniate us, when He instructed us to reckon them as brethren. Well, but Christ plainly teaches a new kind of patience,[fn-58-P5841_1768076:558-nf] when He actually prohibits the reprisals which the Creator permitted in requiring \"an eye for an eye,[fn-58-P5842_1768296:559-nf] and a tooth for a tooth,\"[fn-58-P5843_1768491:560-nf] and bids us, on the contrary, \"to him who smiteth us on the one cheek, to offer the other also, and to give up our coat to him that taketh away our cloak.\"[fn-58-P5844_1768667:561-nf] No doubt these are supplementary additions by Christ, but they are quite in keeping with the teaching of the Creator.

Who, again, could possibly have added, \"and do not the things which I say? \"Could it have been he who was only then doing his best[fn-59-P5938_1790773:652-nf] to teach them? Or He who from the beginning had addressed to them His messages[fn-59-P5939_1790906:653-nf] both by the law and the prophets? He could then upbraid them with disobedience, even if He had no ground at any time else for His reproof. The fact is, that He who was then imputing to them their ancient obstinacy was none other than He who, before the coming of Christ, had addressed to them these words, \"This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart standeth far off from me.\"[fn-59-P5940_1791314:654-nf] Otherwise, how absurd it were that a new god, a new Christ, the revealer of a new and so grand a religion should denounce as obstinate and disobedient those whom he had never had it in his power to make trial of!","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":28,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":29,"source_paragraph":"104","folder":"ANF-03","text":"I prefer elsewhere refuting[fn-64-P6410_1895284:1093-nf] the faults which the Marcionites find in the Creator.

We have often already laid it down for certain,[fn-64-P6415_1896148:1098-nf] that He could not have been branded[fn-64-P6416_1896202:1099-nf] as the destroyer of the law if He had promulged another god. Therefore even the Pharisee, who invited Him to dinner in the passage before us,[fn-64-P6417_1896363:1100-nf] expressed some surprise[fn-64-P6418_1896402:1101-nf] in His presence that He had not washed before He sat down to meat, in accordance with the law, since it was the God of the law that He was proclaiming.[fn-64-P6419_1896576:1102-nf] Jesus also interpreted the law to him when He told him that they \"made clean the outside of the cup and the platter, whereas their inward part was full of ravening and wickedness.\" This He said, to signify that by the cleansing of vessels was to be understood before God the purification of men, inasmuch as it was about a man, and not about an unwashed vessel, that even this Pharisee had been treating in His presence. He therefore said: \"You wash the outside of the cup,\" that is, the flesh, \"but you do not cleanse your inside part,\"[fn-64-P6420_1897137:1103-nf] that is, the soul; adding: \"Did not He that made the outside,\" that is, the flesh, \"also make the inward part,\" that is to say, the soul?-by which assertion He expressly declared that to the same God belongs the cleansing of a man's external and internal nature, both alike being in the power of Him who prefers mercy not only to man's washing,[fn-64-P6421_1897504:1104-nf] but even to sacrifice.[fn-64-P6422_1897545:1105-nf] For He subjoins the command: \"Give what ye possess as alms, and all things shall be clean unto you.\"[fn-64-P6423_1897697:1106-nf] Even if another god could have enjoined mercy, he could not have done so previous to his becoming known. Furthermore, it is in this passage evident that they[fn-64-P6424_1897877:1107-nf] were not reproved concerning their God, but concerning a point of His instruction to them, when He prescribed to them figuratively the cleansing of their vessels, but really the works of merciful dispositions. In like manner, He upbraids them for tithing paltry herbs,[fn-64-P6425_1898182:1108-nf] but at the same time \"passing over hospitality[fn-64-P6426_1898249:1109-nf] and the love of God.[fn-64-P6427_1898502:1110-nf] The vocation and the love of what God, but Him by whose law of tithes they used to offer their rue and mint? For the whole point of the rebuke lay in this, that they cared about small matters in His service of course, to whom they failed to exhibit their weightier duties when He commanded them: \"Thou shalt love with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, the Lord thy God, who hath called thee out of Egypt.\"[fn-64-P6428_1898963:1111-nf] Besides, time enough had not yet passed to admit of Christ's requiring so premature-nay, as yet so distasteful[fn-64-P6429_1899096:1112-nf] -a love towards a new and recent, not to say a hardly i yet developed,[fn-64-P6430_1899184:1113-nf] deity. When, again, He upbraids those who caught at the uppermost places and the honour of public salutations, He only follows out the Creator's course,[fn-64-P6431_1899366:1114-nf] who calls ambitious persons of this character \"rulers of Sodom\"[fn-64-P6432_1899459:1115-nf] who forbids us \"to put confidence even in princes,\"[fn-64-P6433_1899532:1116-nf] and pronounces him to be altogether wretched who places his confidence in man. But whoever[fn-64-P6434_1899647:1117-nf] aims at high position, because he would glory in the officious attentions[fn-64-P6435_1899742:1118-nf] of other people, (in every such case, ) inasmuch as He forbade such attentions (in the shape) of placing hope and confidence in man, He at the same time[fn-64-P6436_1899914:1119-nf] censured all who were ambitious of high positions. He also inveighs against the doctors of the law themselves, because they were \"lading men with burdens grievous to be borne, which they did not venture to touch with even a finger of their own; \"[fn-64-P6437_1900176:1120-nf] but not as if He made a mock of[fn-64-P6438_1900230:1121-nf] the burdens of the law with any feeling of detestation towards it. For how could He have felt aversion to the law, who used with so much earnestness to upbraid them for passing over its weightier matters, alms-giving, hospitality,[fn-64-P6439_1900483:1122-nf] and the love of God? Nor, indeed, was it only these great things (which He recognized), but even[fn-64-P6440_1900620:1123-nf] the tithes of rue and the cleansing of cups. But, in truth, He would rather have deemed them excusable for being unable to carry burdens which could not be borne. What, then, are the burdens which He censures?[fn-64-P6441_1900847:1124-nf] None but those which they were accumulating of their own accord, when they taught for commandments the doctrines of men; for the sake of private advantage joining house to house, so as to deprive their neighbour of his own; cajoling[fn-64-P6442_1901096:1125-nf] the people, loving gifts, pursuing rewards, robbing the poor of the rights of judgment, that they might have the widow for a prey and the fatherless for a spoil.[fn-64-P6443_1901278:1126-nf] Of these Isaiah also says, \"Woe unto them that are strong in Jerusalem!\"[fn-64-P6444_1901389:1127-nf] and again, \"They that demand you shall rule over you.\"[fn-64-P6445_1901470:1128-nf] And who did this more than the lawyers?[fn-64-P6446_1901646:1129-nf] Now, if these offended Christ, it was as belonging to Him that they offended Him. He would have aimed no blow at the teachers of an alien law. But why is a \"woe\" pronounced against them for \"building the sepulchres of the prophets whom their fathers had killed? \"[fn-64-P6447_1901964:1130-nf] They rather deserved praise, because by such an act of piety they seemed to show that they did not allow the deeds of their fathers. Was it not because (Christ) was jealous[fn-64-P6448_1902159:1131-nf] of such a disposition as the Marcionites denounce, visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the fourth generation? What \"key,\" indeed, was it which these lawyers had,[fn-64-P6449_1902359:1132-nf] but the interpretation of the law? Into the perception of this they neither entered themselves, even because they did not believe (for \"unless ye believe, ye shall not understand\"); nor did they permit others to enter, because they preferred to teach them for commandments even the doctrines of men. When, therefore, He reproached those who did not themselves enter in, and also shut the door against others, must He be regarded as a disparager of the law, or as a supporter of it? If a disparager, those who were hindering the law ought to have been pleased; if a supporter, He is no longer an enemy of the law.[fn-64-P6450_1902994:1133-nf] But all these imprecations He uttered in order to tarnish the Creator as a cruel Being,[fn-64-P6451_1903118:1134-nf] against whom such as offended were destined to have a \"woe.\" And who would not rather have feared to provoke a cruel Being,[fn-64-P6452_1903274:1135-nf] by withdrawing allegiance[fn-64-P6453_1903317:1136-nf] from Him? Therefore the more He represented the Creator to be an object of fear, the more earnestly would He teach that He ought to be served. Thus would it behove the Creator's Christ to act.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"143","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"40. Besides, we ought certainly to note the fact that the evangelical and apostolical Scriptures do not confine this designation of His \"disciples\" to those twelve alone, but give the same appellation to all those who believed on Him, and were educated under His instruction for the kingdom of heaven. Out of the whole number of such He chose twelve, whom He also named apostles, as Luke mentions.

This leper is also referred to by Luke?[fn-16-P1618_661104:192-nf] not indeed in this order, but after the manner in which the writers are accustomed to act, recording at a subsequent point things which have been omitted at a previous stage, or bringing in at an earlier point occurrences which took place at a later period, according as they had incidents suggested to their minds by the heavenly influence, with which indeed they had become acquainted before, but which they were afterwards prompted to commit to writing as they came up to their recollection. This same Luke, however, has also left us a version of his own of that copious discourse of the Lord, in a passage which he commences just as the section in Matthew begins. For in the latter the words run thus: \"Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven;\"[fn-16-P1619_662046:193-nf] while in the former they are put thus: \"Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.\"[fn-16-P1620_662159:194-nf] Then, too, much of what follows in Luke's narrative is similar to what we have in the other. And finally, the conclusion given to the sermon is repeated in both Gospels in its entire identity,-namely, the story of the wise man who builds upon the rock, and the foolish man who builds upon the sand; the only difference being, that Luke speaks only of the stream beating against the house, and does not mention also the rain and the wind, as they occur in Matthew. Accordingly, it might very readily be believed that he has there introduced the self-same discourse of the Lord, but that at the same time he has omitted certain sentences which Matthew has inserted; that he has also brought in other sayings which Matthew has not mentioned; and that, in a similar manner, he has expressed certain of these utterances in somewhat different terms, but without detriment to the integrity of the truth.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"150","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"45. This we might very well suppose to have been the case, as I have said, were it not that a difficulty is felt to attach to the circumstance that Matthew tells us how this discourse was delivered on a mount by the Lord in a sitting posture; while Luke says that it was spoken on a plain by the Lord in a standing posture. This difference, accordingly, makes it seem as if the former referred to one discourse, and the latter to another. And what should there be, indeed, to hinder [us from supposing] Christ to have repeated elsewhere some words which He had already spoken, or from doing a second time certain things which He had already done on some previous occasion? However, that these two discourses, of which the one is inserted by Matthew and the other by Luke, are not separated by a long space of time, is with much probability inferred from the fact that, at once in what precedes and in what follows them, both the evangelists have related certain incidents either similar or perfectly identical, so that it is not unreasonably felt that the narrations of the writers who introduce these things are occupied with the same localities and days. For Matthew's recital proceeds in the following terms: \"And there followed Him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan. And seeing the multitudes, He went up into a mountain; and when He was set, His disciples came unto Him: and He opened His mouth, and taught them, saying, Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven ;\"[fn-16-P1622_664660:195-nf] and so forth. Here it may appear that His desire was to free Himself from the great crowds of people, and that for this reason He went up into the mountain, as if He meant to withdraw Himself from the multitudes, and seek an opportunity of speaking with His disciples alone. And this seems to be certified also by Luke, whose account is to the following effect: \"And it came to pass in those days, that He went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God. And when it was day, He called unto Him His disciples: and of them He chose twelve, whom also He named apostles; Simon, whom He also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew, Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alpheus, and Simon, who is called Zelotes, Judas the brother of James, and Judas Scarioth, which was the traitor. And He came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of His disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea-coast of Tyre[fn-16-P1623_665711:196-nf] and Sidon, which had come to hear Him, and to be healed of their diseases; and they that were vexed with unclean spirits were healed.[fn-16-P1624_665957:197-nf] And the whole multitude sought to touch Him; for there went virtue out of Him, and healed them all. And He lifted up His eyes on His disciples, and said, Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of heaven;\"[fn-16-P1625_666224:198-nf] and so on. Here the relation permits us to understand that, after selecting on the mountain twelve disciples out of the larger body, whom He also named apostles (which incident Matthew has omitted), He then delivered that discourse which Matthew has introduced, and which Luke has left unnoticed,-that is to say, the one on the mount; and that thereafter, when He had now come down, He spoke in the plain a second discourse similar to the first, on which Matthew is silent, but which is detailed by Luke; and further, that both these sermons were concluded in the same manner.[fn-16-P1626_666824:199-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":36,"source_paragraph":"201","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"81.

Accordingly, when Matthew says, \"And when He was departed thence, He came into their synagogue,\" the words do indeed import that the said coming did not take place until after He had departed from the previously mentioned locality; but, at the same time, they leave the question undecided as to the number of days which may have elapsed between His passing from the aforesaid corn-field and His coming into their synagogue; and they express nothing as to His going there in direct and immediate succession. And thus space is offered us for getting in the narrative of Luke, who tells us that it was on another Sabbath that this man's hand was restored.

Matthew continues his narrative, connecting it in the following manner with what precedes: \"But the Pharisees went out and held a council against Him, how they might destroy Him. But when Jesus knew it, He withdrew Himself from thence: and great multitudes followed Him, and He healed them all; and charged them that they should not make Him known: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet Esaias, saying;\" and so forth, down to where it is said, \"And in His name shall the Gentiles trust.\"[fn-18-P1847_755091:348-nf] He is the only one that records these facts. The other two have advanced to other themes. Mark, it is true, seems to some extent to have kept by the historical order: for he tells us how Jesus, on discovering the malignant disposition which was entertained toward Him by the Jews, withdrew to the sea along with His disciples, and that then vast multitudes flocked to Him, and He healed great numbers of them.[fn-18-P1848_755573:349-nf] But, at the same time, it is not quite clear at what precise point He begins to pass to a new subject, different from what would have followed in strict succession. He leaves it uncertain whether such a transition is made at the point where he tells us how the multitudes gathered about Him (for if that was the case now, it might equally well have been the case at some other time), or at the point where He says that \"He goeth up into a mountain.\" It is this latter circumstance that Luke also appears to notice when he says, \"And it came to pass in those days, that He went out into a mountain to pray.\"[fn-18-P1849_756203:350-nf] For by the expression \"in those days,\" he makes it plain enough that the incident referred to did not occur in immediate succession upon what precedes.[fn-18-P1850_756375:351-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":41,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_12_book_viii_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"25","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Since the great body of (the heretics) do not employ the counsel of the Lord, by having the beam in the eye,[fn-20-P2039_626976:4-nf] and announce that they see when in reality labouring under blindness, it seems to us expedient in no wise to be silent concerning the tenets of these.

Thou shalt not exalt thyself, but shalt be of a lowly mind.[fn-34-P3434_585509:245-nf] Thou shalt not take glory to thyself. Thou shalt not take evil counsel against thy neighbour.

As far as possible, thou shalt be pure in thy soul. Do not be ready to stretch forth thy hands to take, whilst thou contractest them to give. Thou shalt love, as the apple of thine eye, every one that speaketh to thee the word of the Lord. Thou shalt remember the day of judgment, night and day. Thou shalt seek out every day the faces of the saints,[fn-34-P3453_588949:264-nf] either by word examining them, and going to exhort them, and meditating how to save a soul by the word,[fn-34-P3454_589156:265-nf] or by thy hands thou shalt labour for the redemption of thy sins. Thou shalt not hesitate to give, nor murmur when thou givest. \"Give to every one that asketh thee,\"[fn-34-P3455_589715:266-nf] and thou shalt know who is the good Recompenser of the reward.

Thou shalt not make a schism, but thou shalt pacify those that contend by bringing them together. Thou shalt confess thy sins. Thou shalt not go to prayer with an evil conscience.

Evidently, in the case of Christ both the divine nature and the will and the sect are different from any previously known! He will have commanded either no martyrdoms at all, or those which must be understood in a sense different from the ordinary, being such a person as to urge no one to a risk of this kind as to promise no reward to them who suffer for Him, because He does not wish them to suffer; and therefore does He say, when setting forth His chief commands, \"Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\"[fn-110-P11043_3120954:57-nf] The following statement, indeed, applies first to all without restriction, then specially to the apostles themselves: \"Blessed shall ye be when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you, for my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad, since very great is your reward in heaven; for so used their fathers to do even to the prophets.\" So that He likewise foretold their having to be themselves also slain, after the example of the prophets. Though, even if He had appointed all this persecution in case He were obeyed for those only who were then apostles, assuredly through them along with the entire sacrament, with the shoot of the name, with the layer of the Holy Spirit, the rule about enduring persecution also would have had respect to us too, as to disciples by inheritance, and, (as it were, )bushes from the apostolic seed. For even thus again does He address words of guidance to the apostles: \"Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves; \"and, \"Beware of men, for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues; and ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles,\" etc.[fn-110-P11044_3122219:58-nf] Now when He adds, \"But the brother will deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child; and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death,\" He has dearly announced with reference to the others, (that they would be subjected to) this form of unrighteous conduct, which we do not find exemplified in the case of the apostles. For none of them had experience of a father or a brother as a betrayer, which very many of us have. Then He returns to the apostles: \"And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.\" How much more shall we, for whom there exists the necessity of being delivered up by parents too! Thus, by allotting this very betrayal, now to the apostles, now to all, He pours out the same destruction upon all the possessors of the name, on whom the name. along with the condition that it be an object of hatred, will rest. But he who will endure on to the end-this man will be saved. By enduring what but persecution,-betrayal,-death? For to endure to the end is nought else than to suffer the end. And therefore there immediately follow, \"The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his own lord; \"because, seeing the Master and Lord Himself was stedfast in suffering persecution, betrayal and death, much more will it be the duty of His servants and disciples to bear the same, that they may not seem as if superior to Him, or to have got an immunity from the assaults of unrighteousness, since this itself should be glory enough for them, to be conformed to the sufferings of their Lord and Master; and, preparing them for the endurance of these, He reminds them that they must not fear such persons as kill the body only, but are not able to destroy the soul, but that they must dedicate fear to Him rather who has such power that He can kill both body and soul, and destroy them in hell. Who, pray, are these slayers of the body only, but the governors and kings aforesaid-men, I ween? Who is the ruler of the soul also, but God only? Who is this but the threatener of fires hereafter, He without whose will not even one of two sparrows falls to the ground; that is, not even one of the two substances of man, flesh or spirit, because the number of our hairs also has been recorded before Him? Fear ye not, therefore. When He adds, \"Ye are of more value than many sparrows,\" He makes promise that we shall not in vain-that is, not without profit-fall to the ground if we choose to be killed by men rather than by God. \"Whosoever therefore will confess in me before men, in him will I confess also before my Father who is in heaven;[fn-110-P11045_3124856:59-nf] and whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I deny also before my Father who is in heaven.\" Clear, as I think, are the terms used in announcing, and the way to explain, the confession as well as the denial, although the mode of putting them is different. He who confesses himself a Christian, beareth witness that he is Christ's; he who is Christ's must be in Christ. If he is in Christ, he certainly confesses in Christ, when he confesses himself a Christian. For he cannot be this without being in Christ. Besides, by confessing in Christ he confesses Christ too: since, by virtue of being a Christian, he is in Christ, while Christ Himself also is in him. For if you have made mention of day, you have also held out to view the element of light which gives us day, although you may not have made mention of light. Thus, albeit He has not expressly said, \"He who will confess me,\" (yet) the conduct involved in daily confession Is not different from what is meant in our Lord's declaration. For he who confesses himself to be what he is, that is, a Christian, confesses that likewise by which he is it, that is, Christ. Therefore he who has denied that he is a Christian, has denied in Christ, by denying that he is in Christ while he denies that he is a Christian; and, on the other hand, by denying that Christ is in him, while He denies that he is in Christ, he will deny Christ too. Thus both he who will deny in Christ, will deny Christ, and he who will confess in Christ will confess Christ. It would have been enough, therefore, though our Lord had made an announcement about confessing merely. For, from His mode of presenting confession, it might be decided beforehand with reference to its opposite too-denial, that is-that denial is repaid by the Lord with denial, just as confession is with confession. And therefore, since in the mould in which the confession has been cast the state of (the case with reference to) denial also may be perceived, it is evident that to another manner of denial belongs what the Lord has announced concerning it, in terms different from those in which He speaks of confession, when He says, \"Who will deny me,\" not \"Who will deny in me.\" For He had foreseen that this form of violence also would, for the most part, immediately follow when any one had been forced to renounce the Christian name,-that he who had denied that he was a Christian would be compelled to deny Christ Himself too by blaspheming Him.

But there is more, because He threatens likewise shame with shame (in return): \"Whosoever shall be ashamed of me before men, of him will I also be ashamed before my Father who is in heaven.\" For He was aware that denial is produced even most of all by shame, that the state of the mind appears in the forehead, and that the wound of shame precedes that in the body.","title":"Scorpiace.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_45_scorpiace_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"38","folder":"ANF-03","text":"It remains for us, lest ancient times may perhaps have had the sacrament[fn-110-P11042_3120087:56-nf] (exclusively) their own, to review the modern Christian system, as though, being also from God, it might be different from what preceded, and besides, therefore, opposed thereto in its code of rules likewise, so that its Wisdom knows not to murder her own sons!

Doubtless, when the souls have departed from their bodies, and begun to be put upon trial in the several stories of the heavens, with reference to the engagement (under which they have come to Jesus), and to be questioned about those hidden mysteries of the heretics, they must then confess before the real powers and the real men,-the Teleti,[fn-110-P11049_3129035:60-nf] to wit, and the Abascanti,[fn-110-P11050_3129080:61-nf] and the Acineti[fn-110-P11051_3129122:62-nf] of Valentinus!

Clearly, it is so written. Yet not therefore must we understand that there is, besides us, another kind of man, which-for it is evidently thus (in the case proposed)-has been able to assume without invalidating a comparison between the two kinds, both the characteristics of the race and a unique property. For even if the life was tainted, so that condemned to contempt it might be likened to objects held in contempt, the nature was not forthwith taken away, so that there might be supposed to be another under its name. Rather is the nature preserved, though the life blushes; nor does Christ know other men than those with reference to whom He says, \"Whom do men say that I am? \"[fn-110-P11053_3130096:64-nf] And, \"As ye would that men should do to you, do ye likewise so to, them.\"[fn-110-P11054_3130190:65-nf] Consider whether He may not have I preserved a race such that He is looking for a testimony to Himself from them, as well as l consisting of those on whom He enjoins the interchange of righteous dealing. But if I should urgently demand that those heavenly men be described to me, Aratus will sketch more easily Perseus and Cepheus, and Erigone, and Ariadne, among the constellations. But who prevented the Lord from clearly prescribing that confession by men likewise has to be made where He plainly announced that His own would be; so that the statement might have run thus: \"Whosoever shall confess in me before men in heaven, I also will confess in him before my Father who is in heaven? \"He ought to have saved me from this mistake about confession on earth, which He would not have wished me to take part in, if He had commanded one in heaven; for I knew no other men but the inhabitants of the earth, man himself even not having up to that time been observed in heaven. Besides, what is the credibility of the things (alleged), that, being after death raised to heavenly places, I should be put to the test there, whither I would not be translated without being already tested, that I should there be tried in reference to a command where I could not come, but to find admittance? Heaven lies open to the Christian before the way to it does; because there is no way to heaven, but to him to whom heaven lies open; and he who reaches it will enter. What powers, keeping guard at the gate, do I hear you affirm to exist in accordance with Roman superstition, with a certain Carnus, Forculus, and Limentinus? What powers do you set in order at the railings? If you have ever read in David, \"Lift up your gates, ye princes, and let the everlasting gates be lifted up; and the King of glory shall enter in; \"[fn-110-P11055_3132036:66-nf] if you have also heard from Amos, \"Who buildeth up to the heavens his way of ascent, and is such as to pour forth his abundance (of waters) over the earth; \"[fn-110-P11056_3132212:67-nf] know that both that way of ascent was thereafter levelled with the ground, by the footsteps of the Lord, and an entrance thereafter opened up by the might of Christ, and that no delay or inquest will meet Christians on the threshold, since they have there to be not discriminated from one another, but owned, and not put to the question, but received in. For though you think heaven still shut, remember that the Lord left here to Peter and through him to the Church, the keys of it, which every one who has been here put to the question, and also made confession, will carry with him. But the devil stoutly affirms that we must confess there, to persuade us that we must deny here. I shall send before me fine documents, to be sure,[fn-110-P11057_3132963:68-nf] I shall carry with me excellent keys, the fear of them who kill the body only, but do nought against the soul: I shall be graced by the neglect of this command: I shall stand with credit in heavenly places, who could not stand in earthly: I shall hold out against the greater powers, who yielded to the lesser: I shall deserve to be at length let in, though now shut out. It readily occurs to one to remark further, \"If it is in heaven that men must confess, it is here too that they must deny.\" For where the one is, there both are. For contraries always go together. There will need to be carried on in heaven persecution even, which is the occasion of confession or denial. Why, then, do you refrain, O most presumptuous heretic, from transporting to the world above the whole series of means proper to the intimidation of Christians, and especially to put there the very hatred for the name, where Christ rules at the right hand of the Father? Will you plant there both synagogues of the Jews-fountains of persecution-before which the apostles endured the scourge, and heathen assemblages with their own circus, forsooth, where they readily join in the cry, Death to the third race?[fn-110-P11058_3134179:69-nf] But ye are bound to produce in the same place both our brothers, fathers, children, mothers-in-law, daughters-in-law and those of our household, through whose agency the betrayal has been appointed; likewise kings, governors, and armed authorities, before whom the matter at issue must be contested. Assuredly there will be in heaven a prison also, destitute of the sun's rays or full of light unthankfully, and fetters of the zones perhaps, and, for a rack-horse, the axis itself which whirls the heavens round. Then, if a Christian is to be stoned, hail-storms will be near; if burned, thunderbolts are at hand; if butchered, the armed Orion will exercise his function; if put an end to by beasts, the north will send forth the bears, the Zodiac the bulls and the lions. He who will endure these assaults to the end, the same shall be saved. Will there be then, in heaven, both an end, and suffering, a killing, and the first confession? And where will be the flesh requisite for all this? Where the body which alone has to be killed by men? Unerring reason has commanded us to set forth these things in even a playful manner; nor will any one thrust out the bar consisting in this objection (we have offered), so as not to be compelled to transfer the whole array of means proper to persecution, all the powerful instrumentality which has been provided for dealing with this matter, to the place where he has put the court before which confession should be made. Since confession is elicited by persecution, and persecution ended in confession, there cannot but be at the same time, in attendance upon these, the instrumentality which determines both the entrance and the exit, that is, the beginning and the end. But both hatred for the name will be here, persecution breaks out here, betrayal brings men forth here, examination uses force here, torture rages here, and confession or denial completes this whole course of procedure on the earth. Therefore, if the other things are here, confession also is not elsewhere; if confession is elsewhere, the other things also are not here. Certainly the other things are not elsewhere; therefore neither is confession in heaven. Or, if they will have it that the manner in which the heavenly examination and confession take place is different, it will certainly be also incumbent on them to devise a mode of procedure of their own of a very different kind, and opposed to that method which is indicated in the Scriptures. And we may be able to say, Let them consider (whether what they imagine to exist does so), if so be that this course of procedure, proper to examination and confession on earth-a course which has persecution as the source in which it originates, and which pleads dissension in the state-is preserved to its own faith, if so be that we must believe just as is also written, and understand just as is spoken. Here I endure the entire course (in question), the Lord Himself not appointing a different quarter of the world for my doing so. For what does He add after finishing with confession and denial? \"Think not that I am come to send peace on earth, but a sword,\"-undoubtedly on the earth. \"For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law. And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.\"[fn-110-P11059_3137697:70-nf] For so is it brought to pass, that the brother delivers up the brother to death, and the father the son: and the children rise up against the parents, and cause them to die. And he who endureth to the end let that man be saved.[fn-110-P11060_3137943:71-nf] So that this whole course of procedure characteristic of the Lord's sword, which has been sent not to heaven, but to earth, makes confession also to be there, which by enduring to the end is to issue in the suffering of death.","title":"Scorpiace.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":28,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_46_the_first_apology_of_justin","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"103","folder":"ANF-01","text":"Concerning chastity, He uttered such sentiments as these:[fn-36-P3657_645019:18-nf] \"Whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart before God.\" And, \"If thy right eye offend thee, cut it out; for it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of heaven with one eye, than, having two eyes, to be cast into everlasting fire.\" And, \"Whosoever shall marry her that is divorced from another husband, committeth adultery.\"[fn-36-P3658_645607:19-nf] And, \"There are some who have been made eunuchs of men, and some who were born eunuchs, and some who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake; but all cannot receive this saying.\"[fn-36-P3659_645834:20-nf] So that all who, by human law, are twice married,[fn-36-P3660_645904:21-nf] are in the eye of our Master sinners, and those who look upon a woman to lust after her.

For in these and other precepts of the Lord the faithful are distinguished, and the unfaithful at the same time disapproved. For these are rather to be borne with by the faithful than made subjects of reproach (exprobrandi); just as there is chaff with the wheat even to the last winnowing, and as there are bad fish with good even on to their separation, which is yet to be on the shore,-that is to say, at the end of the world. By no means, then, can that man be condemned by a human examination, whom God has reserved for His own judgment, that the purpose of God, according to which He has decreed to save what had perished, may be unalterable. And consequently, as His will suffers no change, let no man presume on matters which are not conceded to him. And herein is the meaning of that word which the apostle speaks: \"Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded? \"[fn-92-P9240_3009696:13-nf] To this, too, our Lord's word may refer: \"And if any man will take away thy coat, and sue thee at the law, let him have thy cloak also.\"[fn-92-P9241_3009852:14-nf] And in another place: \"Of him that taketh away thy goods, ask them not again.\"[fn-92-P9242_3009949:15-nf] Moreover, there are certain things which might be thought most trivial were they not shown in the Scriptures to be of more serious import. Who would ever consider the man who says to his brother \"Thou fool\" worthy of hell-fire, were it not that the Truth Himself told us so?[fn-92-P9243_3010242:16-nf] Those, furthermore, who commit those sins whereof the apostle says, \"They who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God,\"[fn-92-P9244_3010392:17-nf] are by all means to be guarded against, and are to be compelled to seek amendment if they do not choose it voluntarily, because they are marked with the stains of infamy, and go down into the pit, unless assistance is brought them by sacerdotal authority. Those also are to be dealt with in like manner of whom he says, \"With such persons, no, not to eat; \"[fn-92-P9245_3010767:18-nf] because such persons are branded with infamy until they are restored by sacerdotal authority, and reinstated in the bosom of our holy mother the Church; since those who are outside us cannot communicate with us. And it is manifest that these are outside us, and ought to be separated from us, with whom it is not lawful for us to eat or to take food. In like manner also, all persons who underlie the charge of any manner of turpitude and dishonour, are rendered infamous; and all who arm themselves against fathers are rendered infamous. \"Sand, and salt, and a mass of iron, is easier to bear than a man without understanding, and foolish and impious.\"[fn-92-P9246_3011440:19-nf] \"He that wanteth understanding thinks upon vain things; and a foolish and erring man imagineth follies.\"[fn-92-P9247_3011568:20-nf] For their suspicion has overthrown many, and their opinion hath held them in vanity. \"A stubborn heart shall fare evil at the last; and he that loveth danger shall perish therein. A heart that entereth two ways shall not have rest; and the evil heart in them shall be made to stumble. A wicked heart shall be laden with sorrows; and the sinner shall heap sin upon sin.\"[fn-92-P9248_3011960:21-nf] The holy apostles and their successors, having such things in mind, and foreseeing, as being filled with the Holy Spirit, the course of wicked men, and having regard to the simple, determined that the accusing of priests should be a matter undertaken with difficulty, or never undertaken, that they might not be ruined or displaced by wicked men. For if this were made an easy matter to secular and wicked men, there would remain no one, or but the scantiest few; seeing that it ever has been and still is the case-and (which is yet worse) that too in growing measure-that the wicked persecute the good, and that the carnal are hostile to the spiritual. For this reason, then, as has been already said, they decreed that such should not be accused at all; or if that could not be avoided, that the accusing of such should be made a matter of great difficulty. And they determined also, as has been stated above, by what persons that function should not be assumed; and they resolved further, that bishops should not be cast out from their own proper seats and churches. But if in any way the matter of accusation should be taken in hand before their rightful seat and all their property are restored by those laws, they should by no means be accused or criminated by any one, and should not answer any one on such charges, unless they choose to do so of their own accord. But after they have been reinstated, as has been before noted, and have had all their effects restored to them by those laws, when their affairs are arranged and set in order, they should then have a long period allowed them for the disposing of their case; and thereafter, if need be, they should be regularly summoned, and so come to the suit; and if the matter seem just, they should answer the propositions of their accusers with the help of their brethren. For so long as their effects, or their churches and property, are held by their adversaries, or by any person, no manner of reason allows that any charge ought to be preferred against them. And no one is at liberty by any means to bring any charge against them, whether superior or inferior, so long as they are dispossessed of their churches, effects, or powers. In like manner also it was decreed, and we too confirm the same statutes and hereby decree, that if any one among the clergy proves an enemy or traducer of his bishops, and seeks to criminate them, or conspires against them, at once, before the consideration of judicial investigation, he should be removed from the clerical order, and given over to the court (curioe), to which he shall devote himself zealously all the days of his life, and shall remain infamous without any hope of restoration. And let no one ever presume to be at once accuser, and judge, or witness; for in every judicial investigation there must always be four persons present: that is, the judges elected, and the accusers, and the defenders, and the witnesses. In like manner we decree and ordain by apostolic authority, that the flock should not dare to bring a charge against their pastor, to whose care they had been consigned, unless he falls into error in the faith; for the deeds of superiors are not to be smitten with the sword of the mouth; neither can the disciple be above the master, as the voice of Truth saith, \"The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.\"[fn-92-P9249_3015358:22-nf] ","title":"The Second Epistle","author":"The Decretals"},{"chapter":6,"verse":35,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_48_dialogue_of_justin","source_chapter":98,"source_paragraph":"528","folder":"ANF-01","text":"\"For the statement in the law, `Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree, '[fn-48-P4887_1073788:369-nf] confirms our hope which depends on the crucified Christ, not because He who has been crucified is cursed by God, but because God foretold that which would be done by you all, and by those like to your, who do not know[fn-48-P4888_1074028:370-nf] that this is He who existed before all, who is the eternal Priest of God, and King, and Christ.

If any one, indeed, venture to ascribe essential corruption to Him who was made after the image and likeness of God, then, in my opinion, this impious charge extends even to the Son of God Himself, for He is called in Scripture the image of God.[fn-74-P7413_1709734:65-nf] Or he who holds this opinion would certainly impugn the authority of Scripture, which says that man was made in the image of God; and in him are manifestly to be discovered traces of the divine image, not by any appearance of the bodily frame, which is corruptible, but by mental wisdom, by justice, moderation, virtue, wisdom, discipline; in fine, by the whole band of virtues, which are innate in the essence of God, and which may enter into man by diligence and imitation of God; as the Lord also intimates in the Gospel, when He says, \"Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful; \"[fn-74-P7414_1710373:66-nf] and, \"Be ye perfect, even as your Father also is perfect.\"[fn-74-P7415_1710450:67-nf] From which it is clearly shown that all these virtues are perpetually in God, and that they can never approach to or depart from Him, whereas by men they are acquired only slowly, and one by one. And hence also by these means they seem to have a kind of relationship with God; and since God knows all things, and none of things intellectual in themselves can elude His notice[fn-74-P7416_1710844:68-nf] (for God the Father alone, and His only-begotten Son, and the Holy Spirit, not only possess a knowledge of those things which they have created, but also of themselves), a rational understanding also, advancing from small things to great, and from things visible to things invisible, may attain to a more perfect knowledge. For it is placed in the body, and advances from sensible things themselves, which are corporeal, to things that are intellectual. But lest our statement that things intellectual are not cognisable by the senses should appear unbecoming, we shall employ the instance of Solomon, who says, \"You will find also a divine sense; \"[fn-74-P7417_1711545:69-nf] by which he shows that those things which are intellectual are to be sought out not by means of a bodily sense, but by a certain other which he calls \"divine.\" And with this sense must we look on each of those rational beings which we have enumerated above; and with this sense are to be understood those words which we speak, and those statements to be weighed which we commit to writing. For the divine nature knows even those thoughts which we revolve within us in silence. And on those matters of which we have spoken, or on the others which follow from them, according to the rule above laid down, are our opinions to be formed.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":6,"verse":28,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_38_letter_of_an_inquirer_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"136","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"§13.

Is it not evident to all that they are stones, as is the veritable Hermes himself? As the Halo is not a god, and as the Iris is not a god, but are states of the atmosphere and of the clouds; and as, likewise, a day is not a god, nor a year, nor time, which is made up of these, so neither is sun nor moon, by which each of those mentioned above is determined. Who, then, in his right senses, can imagine Correction, and Punishment, and Justice, and Retribution to be gods? For neither the Furies, nor the Fates, nor Destiny are gods, since neither Government, nor Glory, nor Wealth are gods, which last [as Plutus] painters represent as blind. But if you deify Modesty, and Love, and Venus, let these be followed by Infamy, and Passion, and Beauty, and Intercourse. Therefore Sleep and Death cannot reasonably any more be regarded as twin deities, being merely changes which take place naturally in living creatures; no more will you with propriety call Fortune, or Destiny, or the Fates goddesses. And if Strife and Battle be not gods, no more are Arês and Enyo. Still further, if the lightnings, and thunderbolts, and rains are not gods, how can fire and water be gods? how can shooting stars and comets, which are produced by atmospheric changes? He who calls Fortune a god, let him also so call Action. If, then, none of these, nor of the images formed by human hands, and destitute of feeling, is held to be a God, while a providence exercised about us is evidently the result of a divine power,[fn-32-P3204_942177:136-nf] it remains only to acknowledge this, that He alone who is truly God, only truly is and subsists. But those who are insensible to this are like men who have drunk mandrake or some other drug. May God grant that you may at length awake from this slumber, and know God; and that neither Gold, nor Stone, nor Tree, nor Action, nor Suffering, nor Disease, nor Fear, may appear in your eyes as a god. For there are, in sooth, \"on the fruitful earth thrice ten thousand\" demons, not immortal, nor indeed mortal; for they are not endowed with sensation, so as to render them capable of death, but only things of wood and stone, that hold despotic sway over men insulting and violating life through the force of custom. \"The earth is the Lord's,\" it is said, \"and the fulness thereof.\"[fn-32-P3205_943378:137-nf] Then why darest thou, while luxuriating in the bounties of the Lord, to ignore the Sovereign Ruler? \"Leave my earth,\" the Lord will say to thee. \"Touch not the water which I bestow. Partake not of the fruits of the earth produced by my husbandry\" Give to God recompense for your sustenance; acknowledge thy Master. Thou art God's creature. What belongs to Him, how can it with justice be alienated? For that which is alienated, being deprived of the properties that belonged to it, is also deprived of truth. For, after the fashion of Niobe, or, to express myself more mystically, like the Hebrew woman called by the ancients Lot's wife, are ye not turned into a state of insensibility? This woman we have heard, was turned into stone for her love of Sodore. And those who are godless, addicted to impiety, hard-hearted and foolish are Sodomites. Believe that these utterances are addressed to you from God. For think not that stones, and stocks, and birds, and serpents are sacred things, and men are not; but, on the contrary, regard men as truly sacred,[fn-32-P3206_944473:138-nf] and take beasts and stones for what they are. For there are miserable wretches of human kind, who consider that God utters His voice by the raven and the jackdaw, but says nothing by man; and honour the raven as a messenger of God. But the man of God, who croaks not, nor chatters, but speaks rationally and instructs lovingly, alas, they persecute; and while he is inviting them to cultivate righteousness, they try inhumanly to slay him, neither welcoming the grace which, comes from above, nor fearing the penalty. For they believe not God, nor understand His power, whose love to man is ineffable; and His hatred of evil is inconceivable. His anger augments punishment against sin; His love bestows blessings on repentance. It is the height of wretchedness to be deprived of the help which comes from God. Hence this blindness of eyes and dulness of hearing are more grievous than other inflictions of the evil one; for the one deprives them of heavenly vision, the other robs them of divine instruction. But ye, thus maimed as respects the truth, blind in mind, deaf in understanding, are not grieved, are not pained, have had no desire to see heaven and the Maker of heaven, nor, by fixing your choice on salvation, have sought to hear the Creator of the universe, and to learn of Him; for no hindrance stands in the way of him who is bent on the knowledge of God. Neither childlessness, nor poverty, nor obscurity, nor want, can hinder him who eagerly strives after the knowledge of God; nor does any one who has conquered[fn-32-P3207_946125:139-nf] by brass or iron the true wisdom for himself choose to exchange it, for it is vastly preferred to everything else. Christ is able to save in every place. For he that is fired with ardour and admiration for righteousness, being the lover of One who needs nothing, needs himself but little, having treasured up his bliss in nothing but himself and God, where is neither moth,[fn-32-P3208_946659:140-nf] robber, nor pirate, but the eternal Giver of good. With justice, then, have you been compared to those serpents who shut their ears against the charmers. For \"their mind,\" says the Scripture, \"is like the serpent, like the deaf adder, which stoppeth her ear, and will not hear the voice of the charmers.\"[fn-32-P3209_946988:141-nf] But allow yourselves to feel the influence of the charming strains of sanctity, and receive that mild word of ours, and reject the deadly poison, that it may be granted to you to divest yourselves as much as possible of destruction, as they[fn-32-P3210_947371:142-nf] have been divested of old age. Hear me, and do not stop your ears; do not block up the avenues of hearing, but lay to heart what is said. Excellent is the medicine of immortality! Stop at length your grovelling reptile motions.[fn-32-P3211_947654:143-nf] \"For the enemies of the Lord,\" says Scripture, \"shall lick the dust.\"[fn-32-P3212_947866:144-nf] Raise your eyes from earth to the skies, look up to heaven, admire the sight, cease watching with outstretched head the heel of the righteous, and hindering the way of truth. Be wise and harmless. Perchance the Lord will endow you with the wing of simplicity (for He has resolved to give wings to those that are earth-born), that you may leave your holes and dwell in heaven. Only let us with our whole heart repent, that we may be able with our whole heart to contain God. \"Trust in Him, all ye assembled people; pour out all your hearts before Him.\"[fn-32-P3213_948438:145-nf] He says to those that have newly abandoned wickedness, \"He pities them, and fills them with righteousness.\" Believe Him who is man and God; believe, O man. Believe, O man, the living God, who suffered and is adored. Believe, ye slaves,[fn-32-P3214_948694:146-nf] Him who died; believe, all ye of human kind, Him who alone is God of all men. Believe, and receive salvation as your reward. Seek God, and your soul shall live. He who seeks God is busying himself about his own salvation. Hast thou found God?-then thou hast life. Let us then seek, in order that we may live. The reward of seeking is life with God. \"Let all who seek Thee be glad and rejoice in Thee; and let them say continually, God be magnified.\"[fn-32-P3215_949221:147-nf] A noble hymn of God is an immortal man, established in righteousness, in whom the oracles of truth are engraved. For where but in a soul that is wise can you write truth? where love? where reverence? where meekness? Those who have had these divine characters impressed on them, ought, I think, to regard wisdom as a fair port whence to embark, to whatever lot in life they turn; and likewise to deem it the calm haven of salvation: wisdom, by which those who have betaken themselves to the Father, have proved good fathers to their children; and good parents to their sons, those who have known the Son; and good husbands to their wives, those who remember the Bridegroom; and good masters to their servants,[fn-32-P3216_949950:148-nf] those who have been redeemed from utter slavery. Oh, happier far the beasts than men involved in error! who live in ignorance as you, but do not counterfeit the truth. There are no tribes of flatterers among them. Fishes have no superstition: the birds worship not a single image; only they look with admiration on heaven, since, deprived as they are of reason, they are unable to know God. So are you not ashamed for living through so many periods of life in impiety, making yourselves more irrational than irrational creatures? You were boys, then striplings, then youths, then men, but never as yet were you good. If you have respect for old age, be wise, now that you have reached life's sunset; and albeit at the close of life, acquire the knowledge of God, that the end of life may to you prove the beginning of salvation. You have become old in superstition; as young, enter on the practice of piety. God regards you as innocent children. Let, then, the Athenian follow the laws of Solon, and the Argive those of Phoroneus, and the Spartan those of Lycurgus: but if thou enrol thyself as one of God's people, heaven is thy country, God thy lawgiver. And what are the laws? \"Thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt not seduce boys; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness; thou shalt love the Lord thy God.\"[fn-32-P3217_951387:149-nf] And the complements of these are those laws. of reason and words of sanctity which are inscribed on men's hearts: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; to him who strikes thee on the cheek, present also the other; \"[fn-32-P3218_951643:150-nf] \"thou shalt not lust, for by lust alone thou hast committed adultery.\"[fn-32-P3219_951734:151-nf] How much better, therefore, is it for men from the beginning not to wish to desire things forbidden, than to obtain their desires! But ye are not able to endure the austerity of salvation; but as we delight in sweet' things, and prize them higher for the agreeableness of the pleasure they yield, while, on the other hand, those bitter things which are distasteful to the palate are curative and healing, and the harshness of medicines strengthens people of weak stomach, thus custom pleases and, tickles; but custom pushes into the abyss, while truth conducts to heaven. Harsh it is at first, but a good nurse of youth; and it is at once the decorous place where the household maids and matrons dwell together, and the sage council-chamber. Nor is it difficult to approach, or impossible to attain, but is very near us in our very homes; as Moses, endowed with all wisdom, says, while referring to it, it has its abode in three departments of our constitution-in the hands, the mouth, and the heart: a meet emblem this of truth, which is embraced by these three things in all-will, action, speech. And be not afraid lest the multitude of pleasing objects which rise before you withdraw you from wisdom. You yourself will spontaneously surmount the frivolousness of custom, as boys when they have become men throw aside their toys. For with a celerity unsurpassable, and a benevolence to which we have ready access, the divine power, casting its radiance on the earth, hath filled the universe with the seed of salvation. For it was not without divine care that so great a work was accomplished in so brief a space by the Lord, who, though despised as to appearance, was in reality adored, the expiator of sin, the Saviour, the clement, the Divine Word, He that is truly most manifest Deity, He that is made equal to the Lord of the universe; because He was His Son, and the Word was in God, not disbelieved in by all when He was first preached, nor altogether unknown when, assuming the character of man, and fashioning Himself in flesh, He enacted the drama of human salvation: for He was a true champion and a fellow-champion with the creature. And being communicated most speedily to men, having dawned from His Father's counsel quicker than the sun, with the most perfect ease He made God shine on us.

After all this you dare to say ill your Apology, that you are not the defender nor the champion of Origen, though you think that Eusebius and Pamphilus said all too little in his defence. I shall try to write a reply to those works in another treatise if God grants me a sufficient span of life. For the present let it suffice that I have met your assertions, and that I have set the careful reader on his guard by stating that I never saw in writing the book which was known as the work of Pamphilus till I read it in your own manuscript. It was no great concern of mine to know what was written: in favour of a heretic, and therefore I always took it that the work of Pamphilus was different from that of Eusebius; but, after the question had been raised, I wished to reply to their works, and with this object I read what each of them had to say in Origen's behalf; and then I discerned clearly that the first of Eusebius' six books was the same which you had published both in Greek and Latin as the single book of Pamphilus, only altering the opinion shout the Son and the Holy Spirit, which bore on their face the mark of open blasphemy. It was thus that, when my friend, Dexter, who held the office of praetorian prefect, asked me, ten years ago, to make a list for him of the writers of our faith,[fn-93-P9345_2546543:49-nf] placed among the various treatises assigned to various authors this book as composed by Pamphilus, supposing the matter to be as it had been brought before the public by you and by your disciples. But, since Eusebius himself says that Pamphilus wrote nothing except some short letters to his friends, and the first of his six books contains the precise words which are fictitiously given by you under the name of Pamphilus, it is plain that your object in circulating this book was to introduce heresy under the authority of a martyr. I cannot allow you to make my mistake a cloak for your fraud, when you first pretend that the book is by Pamphilus and then pervert many of its passages so as to make them different in Latin from what they are in Greek. I believed the book to be by the writer whose name it bore, just as I did in reference to the Peri 'Arxwn, and many other of the works of Origen and of other Greek writers, which I never read fill now, and am now compelled to read, because the question of heresy has been raised, and l wish to know what ought to be avoided and what opposed. In my youth, therefore, I translated only the homilies which he delivered in public, and in which there are fewer causes of offence; and this in ignorance and at the request of others: I did not try to prejudice men by means of the parts which they approved in favour of the acceptance of those which are evidently heretical. At all events, to cut short a long discussion, I can point out whence I received the Peri 'Arxwn, namely, from those who copied it from your manuscript. We want in like manner to know whence your copy of it came; for if you are unable to name any one else as the source from which it was derived, you will yourself be convicted of falsifying it.[fn-93-P9346_2548412:50-nf] \"A good man from the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth what is good.\" A tree of a good stock is known by the sweetness of its fruit.

Do not be downcast: nor give up thy zeal, nor become the more torpid; but rather press onward with more eagerness; since even the Apostles, when they preached, although scourged, stoned, and constant inmates of the prisons, did not only after deliverance from dangers, but also in those very dangers, announce with greater forwardness the message of Truth. Paul is to be seen in prison, yea, even in chains, instructing and initiating:[fn-16-P1655_1303482:77-nf] and moreover doing the very same in a court of justice, in shipwreck, in tempest, and in a thousand dangers. Do thou too imitate these saints, and cease not from good works, so long as thou art able; and although thou seest the devil thwarting thee ten thousand times, never fall back! Thou perchance, bearing with thee thy wealth, hast met with shipwreck; but Paul carrying the word, far more precious than all wealth, was going to Rome, and was wrecked; and sustained innumerable hardships. And this he himself signified, when he said, \"Many times we desired to come unto you, but Satan hindered us.\"[fn-16-P1656_1304108:78-nf] And God permitted it; thus revealing the more abundantly His power, and showing that the multitude of things which the devil did, or prevented from being done, neither lessened nor interrupted the preaching of the Gospel. On this account Paul gave God thanks in all things; and knowing that he was himself thereby rendered more approved, he exhibited his exceeding forwardness on every occasion, letting none of these impediments prevent him!","title":"Homily I.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":6,"verse":29,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_56_of_patience_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Now, however, while we run through the causes of impatience, all the other precepts also will answer in their own places.

To cling to God continually, and as you say inseparably to hold fast to meditation on Him, is impossible for a man while still in this weak flesh of ours. But we ought to be aware on what we should have the purpose of our mind fixed, and to what goal we should ever recall the gaze of our soul: and when the mind can secure this it may rejoice; and grieve and sigh when it is withdrawn from this, and as often as it discovers itself to have fallen away from gazing on Him, it should admit that it has lapsed from the highest good, considering that even a momentary departure from gazing on Christ is fornication. And when our gaze has wandered ever so little from Him, let us turn the eyes of the soul back to Him, and recall our mental gaze as in a perfectly straight direction. For everything depends on the inward frame of mind, and when the devil has been expelled. from this, and sins no longer reign in it, it follows that the kingdom of God as founded in us, as the Evangelist says \"The kingdom of God cometh not with observation, nor shall men say Lo here, or lo there: for verily I say unto you that the kingdom of God is within you.\"[fn-35-P3539_1321607:14-nf] But nothing else can be \"within you,\" but knowledge or ignorance of truth, and delight either in vice or in virtue, through which we prepare a kingdom for the devil or for Christ in our heart: and of this kingdom the Apostle describes the character, when he says \"For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-35-P3540_1322000:15-nf] And so if the kingdom of God is within us, and the actual kingdom of God is righteousness and peace and joy, then the man who abides in these is most certainly in the kingdom of God, and on the contrary those who live in unrighteousness, and discord, and the sorrow that worketh death, have their place in the kingdom of the devil, and in hell and death. For by these tokens the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the devil are distinguished: and in truth if lifting up our mental gaze on high we would consider that state in which the heavenly powers live on high, who are truly in the kingdom of God, what should we imagine it to be except perpetual and lasting joy? For what is so specially peculiar and appropriate to true blessedness as constant calm and eternal joy? And that you may be quite sure that this, which we say, is really so, not on my own authority but on that of the Lord, hear how very clearly He describes the character and condition of that world: \"Behold,\" says He, \"I create new beavers and a new earth: and the former things shall not be remembered nor come into mind. But ye shall be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create.\"[fn-35-P3541_1323178:16-nf] And again \"joy and gladness shall be found therein: thanksgiving and the voice of praise, and there shall be month after month, and Sabbath after Sabbath.\"[fn-35-P3542_1323356:17-nf] And again: \"they shall obtain joy and gladness; and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.\"[fn-35-P3543_1323471:18-nf] And if you want to know more definitely about that life and the city of the saints, hear what the voice of the Lord proclaims to the heavenly Jerusalem herself: \"I will make,\" says He, \"thine officers peace and thine overseers righteousness. Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, desolation nor destruction within thy borders. And salvation shall take possession of thy walls, and praise of thy gates. The sun shall be no more thy light by day, neither shall the brightness of the moon give light to thee: but the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and thy God thy glory. Thy sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: but the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended:\"[fn-35-P3544_1324238:19-nf] and therefore the holy Apostle does not say generally or without qualification that every joy is the kingdom of God, but markedly and emphatically that joy alone which is \"in the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-35-P3545_1324450:20-nf] For he was perfectly aware of another detestable joy, of which we hear \"the world shall rejoice,\"[fn-35-P3546_1324571:21-nf] and \"woe unto you that laugh, for ye shall mourn.\"[fn-35-P3547_1324644:22-nf] In fact the kingdom of heaven must be taken in a threefold sense, either that the heavens shall reign, i.e., the saints over other things subdued, according to this text, \"Be thou over five cities, and thou over ten;\"[fn-35-P3548_1324883:23-nf] and this which is said to the disciples: \"Ye shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel:\"[fn-35-P3549_1325022:24-nf] or that the heavens themselves shall begin to be reigned over by Christ, when \"all things are subdued unto Him,\" and God begins to be \"all in all:\"[fn-35-P3550_1325193:25-nf] or else that the saints shall reign in heaven with the Lord.","title":"I.

But thus do I say, \"from strange hands,\" not as if the world were not God's possession, but that we have gifts of this sort, and receive them from others, in the same way as these men had them from the Egyptians who knew not God; and by means of these same do we erect in ourselves the tabernacle of God: for God dwells in those who act uprightly, as the Lord says: \"Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness, that they, when ye shall be put to flight,\"[fn-85-P8589_2427607:427-nf] may receive you into eternal tabernacles.\"[fn-85-P8590_2427799:428-nf] For whatsoever we acquired from unrighteousness when we were heathen, we are proved righteous, when we have become believers, by applying it to the Lord's advantage.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":6,"verse":46,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_62_book_iv_","source_chapter":39,"source_paragraph":"244","folder":"ANF-01","text":"3.

Who then are the clean? Those who make their way by faith steadily towards the Father and the Son; for this is denoted by the steadiness of those which divide the hoof; and they meditate day and night upon the words of God,[fn-89-P8996_2588991:55-nf] that they may be adorned with good works: for this is the meaning of the ruminants.

For you should each mind your own business, that so that which is most expedient may come about [and that your Church may again prosper], when those who have been dispersed have returned again to the unit of the one body, and spiritual peace is established by those who devoutly glorify God. To this end it is well, I think, to look out for high qualifications in your election, that he who is appointed to the Presidency may be suitable for the post. Now the Apostolic injunctions do not direct us to look to high birth, wealth, and distinction in the eyes of the world among the virtues of a Bishop; but if all this should, unsought, accompany your spiritual chiefs, we do not reject it, but consider it merely as a shadow accidentally[fn-43-P4325_2828956:3-nf] following the body; and none the less shall we welcome the more precious endowments, even though they happen to be apart from those boons of fortune. The prophet Amos was a goat-herd; Peter was a fisherman, and his brother Andrew followed the same employment; so too was the sublime John; Paul was a tent-maker, Matthew a publican, and the rest of the Apostles in the same way-not consuls, generals, prefects, or distinguished in rhetoric and philosophy, but poor, and of none of the learned professions, but starting from the more humble occupations of life: and yet for all that their voice went out into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world. \"Consider your calling, brethren, that not many wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called, but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world[fn-43-P4326_2829975:4-nf] .\" Perhaps even now it is thought something foolish, as things appear to men, when one is not able to do much from poverty, or is slighted because of meanness of extraction[fn-43-P4327_2830179:5-nf] , not of character. But who knows whether the horn of anointing is not poured out by grace upon such an one, even though he be less than the lofty and more illustrious? Which was mere to the interest of the Church at Rome, that it should at its commencement be presided over by some high-born and pompous senator, or by the fisherman Peter, who had none of this world's advantages to attract men to him[fn-43-P4328_2830675:6-nf] ? What house had he, what slaves, what property ministering luxury, by wealth constantly flowing in? But that stranger, without a table, without a roof over his head, was richer than those who have all things, because through having nothing he had God wholly. So too the people of Mesopotamia, though they had among them wealthy satraps, preferred Thomas above them all to the presidency of their Church; the Cretans preferred Titus, the dwellers at Jerusalem James, and we Cappadocians the centurion, who at the Cross acknowledged the Godhead of the Lord, though there were many at that time of splendid lineage, whose fortunes enabled them to maintain a stud, and who prided themselves upon having the first place in the Senate. And in all the Church one may see those who are great according to God's standard preferred above worldly magnificence. You too, I think, ought to have an eye to these spiritual qualifications at this time present, if you really mean to revive the ancient glory of your Church. For nothing is better known to you than your own history, that anciently, before the city near you[fn-43-P4329_2832018:7-nf] flourished, the seat of government was with you, and among Bithynian cities there was nothing preeminent above yours. And now, it is true, the public buildings that once graced it have disappeared, but the city that consists in men-whether we look to numbers or to quality-is rapidly rising to a level with its former splendour. Accordingly it would well become you to entertain thoughts that shall not fall below the height of the blessings that now are yours, but to raise your enthusiasm in the work before you to the height of the magnificence of your city, that you may find such a one to preside over the laity as will prove himself not unworthy of you[fn-43-P4330_2833059:8-nf] . For it is disgraceful, brethren, and utterly monstrous, that while no one ever becomes a pilot unless he is skilled in navigation, he who sits at the helm of the Church should not know how to bring the souls of those who sail with him safe into the haven of God. How many wrecks of Churches, men and all, have ere now taken place by the inexperience of their heads! Who can reckon what disasters might not have been avoided, had there been aught of the pilot's skill in those who had command? Nay, we entrust iron, to make vessels with, not to those who know nothing about the matter, but to those who are acquainted with the art of the smith; ought we not therefore to trust souls to him who is well-skilled to soften them by the fervent heat of the Holy Spirit, and who by the impress of rational implements may fashion each one of you to be a chosen and useful vessel? It is thus that the inspired Apostle bids us to take thought, in his Epistle to Timothy[fn-43-P4331_2834047:9-nf] , laying injunction upon all who hear, when he says that a Bishop must be without reproach. Is this all that the Apostle cares for, that he who is advanced to the priesthood should be irreproachable? and what is so great an advantage as that all possible qualifications should be included in one? But he knows full well that the subject is moulded by the character of his superior, and that the upright walk of the guide becomes that of his followers too. For what the Master is, such does he make the disciple to be. For it is impossible that he who has been apprenticed to the art of the smith should practise that of the weaver, or that one who has only been taught to work at the loom should turn out an orator or a mathematician: but on the contrary that which the disciple sees in his master he adopts and transfers to himself. For this reason it is that the Scripture says, \"Every disciple that is perfect shall be as his master[fn-43-P4332_2835002:10-nf] .\" What then, brethren? Is it possible to be lowly and subdued in character, moderate, superior to the love of lucre, wise in things divine, and trained to virtue and considerateness in works and ways, without seeing those qualities in one's master? Nay, I do not know how a man can become spiritual, if he has been a disciple in a worldly school. For how can they who are striving to resemble their master fail to be like him? What advantage is the magnificence of the aqueduct to the thirsty, if there is no water in it, even though the symmetrical disposition of columns[fn-43-P4333_2835717:11-nf] variously shaped rear aloft the pediment[fn-43-P4334_2835793:12-nf] ? Which would the thirsty man rather choose for the supply of his own need, to see marbles beautifully disposed or to find good spring water, even if it flowed through a wooden pipe, as long as the stream which it poured forth was clear and drinkable? Even so, brethren, those who look to godliness should neglect the trappings of outward show, and whether a man exults in powerful friends, or plumes himself on the long list of his dignities, or boasts that he receives large annual revenues, or is puffed up with the thought of his noble ancestry, or has his mind on all sides clouded[fn-43-P4335_2836394:13-nf] with the fumes of self-esteem, should have nothing to do with such an one, any more than with a dry aqueduct, if he display not in his life the primary and essential qualities for high office. But, employing the lamp of the Spirit for the search[fn-43-P4336_2836660:14-nf] , you should, as far as is possible, seek for \"a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed[fn-43-P4337_2837688:15-nf] ,\" that, by your election the garden of delight having been opened and the water of the fountain having been unstopped, there may be a common acquisition to the Catholic Church. May God grant that there may soon be found among you such an one, who shall be a chosen vessel, a pillar of the Church. But we trust in the Lord that so it will be, if you are minded by the grace of concord with one mind to see that which is good, preferring to your own wills the will of the Lord, and that which is approved of Him, and perfect, and well-pleasing in His eyes; that there may be such a happy issue among you, that therein we may rejoice, and you triumph, and the God of all be glorified, Whom glory becometh for ever and ever.","title":"Letter XIII.

For as we said a little while ago spirit does not beget spirit just as soul cannot procreate soul, though we do not doubt that the compacting of flesh is formed from man's seed, as the Apostle clearly distinguishes in the case of both substances; viz., flesh and spirit, what should be ascribed to whom as its author, and says: \"Moreover we have had fathers of our flesh for instructors, and we reverenced them: shall we not much more be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live? \"[fn-47-P4772_1733535:58-nf] What could show more clearly than this distinction, that he laid down that men were the fathers of our flesh, but always taught that God alone was the Father of souls. Although even in the actual compacting of this body a ministerial office alone must be attributed to men, but the chief part of its formation to God the Creator of all, as David says: \"Thy hands have made me and fashioned me:\"[fn-47-P4773_1733949:59-nf] And the blessed Job: \"Hast thou not milked me as milk, and curdled me as cheese? Thou hast put me together with bones and sinews;\"[fn-47-P4774_1734098:60-nf] and the Lord to Jeremiah: \"Before I formed thee in the womb, I knew thee.\"[fn-47-P4775_1734196:61-nf] But Ecclesiastes very clearly and accurately gathers the nature of either substance, and its beginning, by an examination of the rise and commencement, from which each originated, and by a consideration of the end to which each is tending, and decides also of the division of this body and soul, and discourses as follows: \"Before the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns unto God who gave it.\"[fn-47-P4776_1734632:62-nf] But what could be said with greater plainness than that he declares that the matter of the flesh which he styled dust, because it springs from the seed of man, and seems to be sown by his ministration, mush as it was taken from the earth, again return to the earth, while he points out that the spirit which is not begotten by intercourse between the sexes, but belongs to God alone in a special way, returns to its creator? And this also is clearly implied in that breathing by God, through which Adam in the first instance received his life. And so from these passages we clearly infer that no one can be called the Father of spirits but God alone, who makes them out of nothing whenever He pleases, while men can only be termed the fathers of our flesh. So then the devil also in as much as he was created a spirit or an angel and good, had no one as his Father but God his Maker. But when he had become puffed up by pride and had said in his heart: \"I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most High,\"[fn-47-P4777_1735685:63-nf] he became a liar, and \"abode not in the truth;\"[fn-47-P4778_1735773:64-nf] but brought forth a lie from his own storehouse of wickedness and so became not only a liar, but also the father of the actual lie, by which when he promised Divinity to man and said \"Ye shall be as gods,\"[fn-47-P4779_1736259:65-nf] he abode not in the truth, but from the beginning became a murderer, both by bringing Adam into a state of mortality, and by slaying Abel by the hand of his brother at his suggestion. But already the approach of dawn is bringing to a close our discussion, which has occupied nearly two whole nights, and our brief and simple words have drawn our bark of this Conference from the deep sea of questions to a safe harbour of silence, in which deep indeed, as the breath of the Divine Spirit drives us further in, so is there ever opened out a wider and boundless space reaching beyond the sight of our eye, and, as Solomon says, \"It will become much further from us than it was, and a great depth; who shall find it out?\"[fn-47-P4780_1737004:66-nf] Wherefore let us pray the Lord that both His fear and His love, which cannot fail, may continue steadfast in us, and make us wise in all things, and ever shield us unharmed, from the darts of the devil. For with these guards it is impossible for anyone to fall into the snares of death. But there is this difference between the perfect and imperfect, that in the case of the former love is steadfast, and so to speak riper and lasts more abidingly and so makes them persevere in holiness more steadfastly and more easily, while in the case of the latter its position is weaker and it more easily grows cold, and so quickly and more frequently allows them to be entangled in the snares of sin. And when we heard this, the words of this Conference so fired us that when we went away from the old man's cell we longed with a keener ardour of soul than when we first came, for the fulfilment of his teaching.","title":"VIII.

For they say, since what the Father wills, the Son wills also, and is not contrary either in what He thinks or in what He judges, but is in all respects concordant[fn-65-P6592_2615167:82-nf] with Him, declaring doctrines which are the same, and a word consistent and united with the Father's teaching, therefore it is that He and the Father are One; and some of them have dared to write as well as say this[fn-65-P6593_2615950:83-nf] . Now what can be more unseemly or irrational than this? for if therefore the Son and the Father are One and if in this way the Word is like the Father it follows forthwith[fn-65-P6594_2616148:84-nf] that the Angels[fn-65-P6595_2616313:85-nf] too, and the other beings above us, Powers and Authorities, and Thrones and Dominions, and what we see, Sun and Moon, and the Stars, should be sons also, as the Son; and that it should be said of them too, that they and the Father are one, and that each is God's Image and Word. For what God wills, that will they; and neither in judging nor in doctrine are they discordant, but in all things are obedient to their Maker. For they would not have remained in their own glory, unless, what the Father willed, that they had willed also. He, for instance, who did not remain, but went astray, heard the words, `How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning[fn-65-P6596_2617059:86-nf] ?'

And many now too keep the Saviour's command, being merciful `as their Father which is in heaven[fn-65-P6597_2617485:87-nf] ,' and observing the exhortation, `Be ye therefore followers of God as dear children, and walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us[fn-65-P6598_2617656:88-nf] ;' many too have become followers of Paul as he also of Christ[fn-65-P6599_2617746:89-nf] .

For though we have been made after the Image[fn-66-P6602_2618292:92-nf] , and called both image and glory of God, yet not on our own account still, but for that Image and true Glory of God inhabiting us, which is His Word, who was for us afterwards made flesh, have we this grace of our designation.","title":"Discourse III","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":6,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_60_discourse_iii","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"19.

The condition is laid down, the law fixed. \"Forgive as I forgive.\" Therefore He does not forgive, unless thou forgivest. \"Forgive as I forgive.\" Thou wishest to be forgiven when thou askest, forgive him that asks of thee. He that is skilled in heaven's laws[fn-56-P5672_2400316:10-nf] has dictated these prayers: He does not deceive thee; ask according to the tenor of His heavenly voice: say, \"Forgive us, as we also forgive,\" and do what thou sayest.

He who dictated the prayers to thee, is thine Advocate: if thou liest, He is a witness against thee: if thou dost not amend thyself, He will be thy Judge. So then both say it, and do.

Would ye that clause, \"Forgive us our debts,\" should be there, and that we should blot out what follows, \"As we also forgive our debtors \"? Thou shalt not blot it out, lest thou be first blotted out thyself. So then in this prayer thou sayest, \"Give,\" and thou sayest, \"Forgive:\" that thou mayest receive what thou hast not, and may be forgiven what thou hast done amiss. So then thou wishest to receive, give; thou wishest to be forgiven, forgive. It is a brief summary. Hear Christ Himself in another place, \"Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven.\" What will ye forgive?

But unrighteous and shameless avarice, which promises to do some kind act but eludes it, trusts not God, whose promises never fail, and trusts man, who makes such hasty bargains; and while he reckons the present more certain than the future, often deservedly finds that his greed for unjust gain is the cause of by no means unjust loss.","title":"Sermon XVII.

Let us, therefore, in the faith of the disciples, hold frequent converse with our Master. For the world is like the sea to us, my brethren, of which it is written, `This is the great and wide sea, there go the ships; the Leviathan, which Thou hast created to play therein[fn-95-P9595_3455497:44-nf] .' We float on this sea, as with the wind, through our own free-will, for every one directs his course according to his will, and either, under the pilotage of the Word, he enters into rest, or, laid hold on by pleasure, he suffers shipwreck, and is in peril by storm.

For not being confirmed in the faith, and having his regard towards temporal things, he cannot resist the difficulties which arise from afflictions. But like that house, built on the sand by the foolish man, so he, being without understanding[fn-95-P9597_3456260:46-nf] , fails before the assault of temptations, as it were by the winds. But the saints, having their senses exercised in self-possession[fn-95-P9598_3456411:47-nf] , and being strong in faith, and understanding the word, do not faint under trials; but although, from time to time, circumstances of greater trial are set against them, yet they continue faithful, and awaking the Lord Who is with them, they are delivered. So, passing through water and fire, they find relief and duly keep the feast, offering up prayers with thanksgiving to God Who has redeemed them. For either being tempted they are known, like Abraham, or suffering they are approved, like Job, or being oppressed and deceitfully treated, like Joseph, they patiently endure it, or being persecuted, they are not overtaken; but as it is written, through God they `leap over the wall[fn-95-P9599_3457115:48-nf] ' of wickedness, which divides and separates between brethren, and turns them from the truth.

We acknowledge, beloved brethren, that we are owing you, and ought now to repay, what was left over for consideration, how we can understand that there is no real mutual contrariety between these two statements, namely, that after saying, \"In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you, that I go to prepare a place for you;\"-where He makes it clear enough that He said so to them for the very reason that there are many mansions there already, and there is no need of preparing any;[fn-26-P2646_1550610:1-nf] -the Lord again says: \"And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.\" How is it that He goes and prepares a place, if there are many mansions already? If there were not such, He would have said, \"I go to prepare.\" Or if the place has still to be prepared, would He not then also properly have said, \"I go to prepare\"? Are these mansions in existence already, and yet needing still to be prepared? For if they were not in existence, He would have said, \"I go to prepare.\" And yet, because their present state of existence is such as still to stand in need of preparation, He does not go to prepare them in the same sense as they already exist; but if He go and prepare them as they shall be hereafter, He will come again and receive His own to Himself: that where He is, there they may be also. How then are there mansions in the Father's house, and these not different ones but the same, which already exist in a sense in which they can admit of no preparation, and yet do not exist, inasmuch as they are still to be prepared? How are we to think of this, but in the same way as the prophet, who also declares of God, that He has [already] made that which is yet to be. For he says not, Who will make what is yet to be, but, \"Who has made what is yet to be.\"[fn-26-P2647_1552611:2-nf] Therefore He has both made such things and is yet to make them. For they have not been made at all if He has not made them; nor will they ever be if He make them not Himself. He has made them therefore in the way of fore-ordaining them; He has yet to make them in the way of actual elaboration. Just as the Gospel plainly intimates when He chose His disciples, that is to say, at the time of His calling them;[fn-26-P2648_1553910:3-nf] and yet the apostle says, \"He chose us before the foundation of the world,\"[fn-26-P2649_1554002:4-nf] to wit, by predestination, not by actual calling. \"And whom He did predestinate, them He also called;\"[fn-26-P2650_1554119:5-nf] He hath chosen by predestination before the foundation of the world, He chooses by calling before its close. And so also has He prepared those mansions, and is still preparing them and He who has already made the things which are yet to be, is now preparing, not different ones, but the very mansions He has already prepared: what He has prepared in predestination, He is preparing by actual working. Already, therefore; they are, as respects predestination; if it were not so, He would have said, I will go and prepare, that is, I will predestinate. But because they are not yet in a state of practical preparedness He says, \"And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself.\"","title":"Tractate LXVIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":36,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_76_epistle_li_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"21","folder":"ANF-05","text":"16.

And these things they will do unto you, because they have not known the Father nor me. But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them.\"[fn-58-P5808_1809993:7-nf] Nor let any one wonder that we are harassed with constant persecutions, and continually tried with increasing afflictions, when the Lord before predicted that these things would happen in the last times, and has instructed us for the warfare by the teaching and exhortation of His words. Peter also, His apostle, has taught that persecutions occur for the sake of our being proved, and that we also should, by the example of righteous men who have gone before us, be joined to the love of God by death and sufferings. For he wrote in his epistle, and said, \"Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is thing happened unto you; but as often as ye partake in Christ's sufferings, rejoice in all things, that when His glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.

I wish you to know, most pious father, that in these days there has arrived in our parts a certain person named Manes, who gives out that he is to complete the doctrine of the New Testament. And in the statements which he has made there have been some things, indeed, which may harmonize with our faith; but there have been also certain affirmations of his which seem very far removed from what has come down to us by the tradition of our fathers. For he has interpreted some doctrines in a strange fashion, imposing on them certain notions of his own, which have appeared to me to be altogether foreign and opposed to the faith. On the ground of these facts I have now been induced to write this letter to you, knowing the completeness and fulness of your intelligence in doctrine, and being assured that none of these things can escape your cognizance. Accordingly, I have also indulged the confident hope that you cannot be kept back by any grudge[fn-36-P3692_1033765:413-nf] from explaining these matters to us. As to myself, indeed, it is not possible that I shall be drawn away into any novel doctrine; nevertheless, in behalf of all the less instructed, I have been led to ask a word with your authority. For, in truth, the man shows himself to be a person of extraordinary force of character, both in speech and in action; and indeed his very aspect and attire also bear that out. But I shall here write down for your information some few points which I have been able to retain in my memory out of all the topics which have been expounded by him: for I know that even by these few you will have an idea of the rest. You well understand, no doubt, that those who seek to set up any new dogma have the habit of very readily perverting into a conformity with their own notions any proofs they desire to take from the Scriptures.[fn-36-P3693_1034637:414-nf] In anticipation, however, of this, the apostolic word marks out the case thus: \"If any one preach any other gospel unto you than that which you have received, let him be accursed.\"[fn-36-P3694_1034870:415-nf] And consequently, in addition to what has been once committed to us by the apostles, a disciple of Christ ought to receive nothing new as doctrine.[fn-36-P3695_1035037:416-nf] But not to make what I have got to say too long, I return to the subject directly in view. This man then maintained that the law of Moses, to speak shortly, does not proceed from the good God, but from the prince of evil; and that it has no kinship with the new law of Christ, but is contrary and hostile to it, the one being the direct antagonist of the other. When I heard such a sentiment propounded, I repeated to the people that sentence of the Gospel in which our Lord Jesus Christ said of Himself: \"I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil it.\"[fn-36-P3696_1035912:417-nf] The man, however, averred that He did not utter this saying at all; for he held that when we find that He did abrogate[fn-36-P3697_1036051:418-nf] that same law, we are bound to give heed, above all other considerations, to the thing which He actually did. Then he began to cite a great variety of passages from the law, and also many from the Gospel and from the Apostle Paul, which have the appearance of contradicting each other. All this he gave forth at the same time with perfect confidence, and without any hesitation or fear; so that I verily believe he has that serpent as his helper, who is ever our adversary. Well, he declared that there in the law God said, \"I make the rich man and the poor man; \"[fn-36-P3698_1036635:419-nf] while here in the Gospel Jesus called the poor blessed,[fn-36-P3699_1036713:420-nf] and added, that no man could be His disciple unless he gave up all that he had.[fn-37-P3700_1036812:421-nf] Again, he maintained that there Moses took silver and gold from the Egyptians when the people[fn-37-P3701_1036927:422-nf] fled out of Egypt;[fn-37-P3702_1037005:423-nf] whereas Jesus delivered the precept that we should lust after nothing belonging to our neighbour. Then he affirmed that Moses had provided in the law, that an eye should be given in penalty for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;[fn-37-P3703_1037252:424-nf] but that our Lord bade us offer the other cheek also to him who smote the one.[fn-37-P3704_1037351:425-nf] He told us, too, that there Moses commanded the man to be punished and stoned who did any work on the Sabbath, and who failed to continue in all things that were written in the law,[fn-37-P3705_1037553:426-nf] as in fact was done to that person who, yet being ignorant, had gathered a bundle of sticks on the Sabbath-day; whereas Jesus cured a cripple on the Sabbath, and ordered him then also to take up his bed.[fn-37-P3706_1037777:427-nf] And further, He did not restrain His disciples from plucking the ears of corn and rubbing them with their hands on the Sabbath-day,[fn-37-P3707_1037929:428-nf] which yet was a thing which it was unlawful to do on the Sabbaths. And why should I mention other instances? For with many different assertions of a similar nature these dogmas of his were propounded with the utmost energy and the most fervid zeal. Thus, too, on the authority of an apostle, he endeavoured to establish the position that the law of Moses is the law of death, and that the law of Jesus, on the contrary, is the law of life. For he based that assertion on the passage which runs thus: \"In which also may God make us[fn-37-P3708_1038479:429-nf] able ministers of the New Testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. But if the ministration of death, engraven in letters on the stones,[fn-37-P3709_1038695:430-nf] was made in glory, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away; how shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious? For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. For if that which shall be done away is glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.\"[fn-37-P3710_1039283:431-nf] And this passage, as you are also well aware, occurs in the second Epistle to the Corinthians. Besides, he added to this another passage out of the first epistle, on which he based his affirmation that the disciples of the Old Testament were earthly and natural; and in accordance with this, that flesh and blood could not possess the kingdom of God.[fn-37-P3711_1039659:432-nf] He also maintained that Paul himself spoke in his own proper person when he said: \"If I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.\"[fn-37-P3712_1039845:433-nf] Further, he averred that the same apostle made this statement most obviously on the subject of the resurrection of the flesh. when he also said that \"he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh,\"[fn-37-P3713_1040114:434-nf] and that according to the letter the law has in it no advantage.[fn-37-P3714_1040199:435-nf] And again he adduced the statement, that \"Abraham has glory, but not before God; \"[fn-37-P3715_1040301:436-nf] and that \"by the law there comes only the knowledge of sin.\"[fn-37-P3716_1040381:437-nf] And many other things did he introduce, with the view of detracting from the honour of the law, on the ground that the law itself is sin; by which statements the simpler people were somewhat influenced, as he continued to bring them forward; and in accordance with all this, he also made use of the affirmation, that \"the law and the prophets were until John.\"[fn-37-P3717_1040764:438-nf] He declared, however, that John preached the true kingdom of heaven; for verily he held, that by the cutting off of his head it was signified that all who went before him, and who had precedence over him, were to be cut off, and that what was to come after him was alone to be maintained. With reference to all these things, therefore, O most pious Archelaus, send us back a short reply in writing: for I have heard that you have studied such matters in no ordinary degree; and that capacity which you possess is God's gift, inasmuch as God bestows these gifts upon those who are worthy of them, and who are His friends, and who show themselves allied to Him in community of purpose and life.

May it be well with you, incomparable and honourable father!","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":6,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"ANF-06","text":"40. I wish you to know, most pious father, that in these days there has arrived in our parts a certain person named Manes, who gives out that he is to complete the doctrine of the New Testament. And in the statements which he has made there have been some things, indeed, which may harmonize with our faith; but there have been also certain affirmations of his which seem very far removed from what has come down to us by the tradition of our fathers. For he has interpreted some doctrines in a strange fashion, imposing on them certain notions of his own, which have appeared to me to be altogether foreign and opposed to the faith. On the ground of these facts I have now been induced to write this letter to you, knowing the completeness and fulness of your intelligence in doctrine, and being assured that none of these things can escape your cognizance. Accordingly, I have also indulged the confident hope that you cannot be kept back by any grudge[fn-36-P3692_1033765:413-nf] from explaining these matters to us. As to myself, indeed, it is not possible that I shall be drawn away into any novel doctrine; nevertheless, in behalf of all the less instructed, I have been led to ask a word with your authority. For, in truth, the man shows himself to be a person of extraordinary force of character, both in speech and in action; and indeed his very aspect and attire also bear that out. But I shall here write down for your information some few points which I have been able to retain in my memory out of all the topics which have been expounded by him: for I know that even by these few you will have an idea of the rest. You well understand, no doubt, that those who seek to set up any new dogma have the habit of very readily perverting into a conformity with their own notions any proofs they desire to take from the Scriptures.[fn-36-P3693_1034637:414-nf] In anticipation, however, of this, the apostolic word marks out the case thus: \"If any one preach any other gospel unto you than that which you have received, let him be accursed.\"[fn-36-P3694_1034870:415-nf] And consequently, in addition to what has been once committed to us by the apostles, a disciple of Christ ought to receive nothing new as doctrine.[fn-36-P3695_1035037:416-nf] But not to make what I have got to say too long, I return to the subject directly in view. This man then maintained that the law of Moses, to speak shortly, does not proceed from the good God, but from the prince of evil; and that it has no kinship with the new law of Christ, but is contrary and hostile to it, the one being the direct antagonist of the other. When I heard such a sentiment propounded, I repeated to the people that sentence of the Gospel in which our Lord Jesus Christ said of Himself: \"I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil it.\"[fn-36-P3696_1035912:417-nf] The man, however, averred that He did not utter this saying at all; for he held that when we find that He did abrogate[fn-36-P3697_1036051:418-nf] that same law, we are bound to give heed, above all other considerations, to the thing which He actually did. Then he began to cite a great variety of passages from the law, and also many from the Gospel and from the Apostle Paul, which have the appearance of contradicting each other. All this he gave forth at the same time with perfect confidence, and without any hesitation or fear; so that I verily believe he has that serpent as his helper, who is ever our adversary. Well, he declared that there in the law God said, \"I make the rich man and the poor man; \"[fn-36-P3698_1036635:419-nf] while here in the Gospel Jesus called the poor blessed,[fn-36-P3699_1036713:420-nf] and added, that no man could be His disciple unless he gave up all that he had.[fn-37-P3700_1036812:421-nf] Again, he maintained that there Moses took silver and gold from the Egyptians when the people[fn-37-P3701_1036927:422-nf] fled out of Egypt;[fn-37-P3702_1037005:423-nf] whereas Jesus delivered the precept that we should lust after nothing belonging to our neighbour. Then he affirmed that Moses had provided in the law, that an eye should be given in penalty for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;[fn-37-P3703_1037252:424-nf] but that our Lord bade us offer the other cheek also to him who smote the one.[fn-37-P3704_1037351:425-nf] He told us, too, that there Moses commanded the man to be punished and stoned who did any work on the Sabbath, and who failed to continue in all things that were written in the law,[fn-37-P3705_1037553:426-nf] as in fact was done to that person who, yet being ignorant, had gathered a bundle of sticks on the Sabbath-day; whereas Jesus cured a cripple on the Sabbath, and ordered him then also to take up his bed.[fn-37-P3706_1037777:427-nf] And further, He did not restrain His disciples from plucking the ears of corn and rubbing them with their hands on the Sabbath-day,[fn-37-P3707_1037929:428-nf] which yet was a thing which it was unlawful to do on the Sabbaths.

Many things are set forth by inspired Scripture as binding upon all who are anxious to please God. But, for the present, I have only deemed it necessary to speak by way of brief reminder concerning the questions which have recently been stirred among you, so far as I have learnt from the study of inspired Scripture itself. I shall thus leave behind me detailed evidence, easy of apprehension, for the information of industrious students, who in their turn will be able to inform others. The Christian ought to be so minded as becomes his heavenly calling,[fn-28-P2894_958820:2-nf] and his life and conversation ought to be worthy of the Gospel of Christ.[fn-28-P2895_958911:3-nf] The Christian ought not to be of doubtful mind,[fn-28-P2896_958979:4-nf] nor by anything drawn away from the recollection of God and of His purposes and judgments. The Christian ought in all things to become superior to the righteousness existing under the law, and neither swear nor lie.[fn-28-P2897_959216:5-nf] He ought not to speak evil;[fn-28-P2898_959264:6-nf] to do violence;[fn-28-P2899_959296:7-nf] to fight;[fn-29-P2900_959324:8-nf] to avenge himself;[fn-29-P2901_959360:9-nf] to return evil for evil;[fn-29-P2902_959403:10-nf] to be angry.[fn-29-P2903_959435:11-nf] The Christian ought to be patient,[fn-29-P2904_959488:12-nf] whatever he have to suffer, and to convict the wrong-doer in season,[fn-29-P2905_959574:13-nf] not with the desire of his own vindication, but of his brother's reformation,[fn-29-P2906_959670:14-nf] according to the commandment of the Lord. The Christian ought not to say anything behind his brother's back with the object of calumniating him, for this is slander, even if what is said is true.[fn-29-P2907_959885:15-nf] He ought to turn away from the brother who speaks evil against him;[fn-29-P2908_959997:16-nf] he ought not to indulge in jesting.[fn-29-P2909_960081:17-nf] he ought not to laugh nor even to suffer laugh makers.[fn-29-P2910_960151:18-nf] He must not talk idly, saying things which are of no service to the hearers nor to such usage as is necessary and permitted us by God;[fn-29-P2911_960597:19-nf] so that workers may do their best as far as possible to work in silence; and that good words be suggested to them by those who are entrusted with the duty of carefully dispensing the word to the building up of the faith, lest God's Holy Spirit be grieved. Any one who comes in ought not to be able, of his own tree will, to accost or speak to any of the brothers, before those to whom the responsibility of general discipline is committed have approved of it as pleasing to God, with a view to the common good.[fn-29-P2912_961124:20-nf] The Christian ought not to be enslaved by wine;[fn-29-P2913_961517:21-nf] nor to be eager for flesh meat,[fn-29-P2914_961568:22-nf] and as a general rule ought not to be a lover of pleasure in eating or drinking,[fn-29-P2915_961668:23-nf] \"for every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things.\"[fn-29-P2916_961762:24-nf] The Christian ought to regard all the things that are given him for his use, not as his to hold as his own or to lay up;[fn-29-P2917_961903:25-nf] and, giving careful heed to all things as the Lord's, not to overlook any of the things that are being thrown aside and disregarded, should this be the case. No Christian ought to think of himself as his own master, but each should rather so think and act as though given by God to be slave to his like minded brethren;[fn-29-P2918_962245:26-nf] but \"every man in his own order.\"[fn-29-P2919_962301:27-nf] ","title":"Letter XXII","author":"St. Basil"}]
