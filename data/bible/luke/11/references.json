They are the sons of iniquity, and they believed in hypocrisy, and wickedness did not depart from them. For this reason they are not saved, since they cannot be used in the building on account of their iniquities. Wherefore they have been cut off and cast far away on account of the anger of the Lord, for they have roused Him to anger. But I shall explain to you the other stones which you saw lying in great numbers, and not going into the building. Those which are rough are those who have known the truth and not remained in it, nor have they been joined to the saints.[fn-3-P341_57551:23-nf] On this account are they unfit for use.\" \"Who are those that have rents? \"\"These are they who are at discord in their hearts one with another, and are not at peace amongst themselves: they indeed keep peace before each other, but when they separate one from the other, their wicked thoughts remain in their hearts. These, then, are the rents which are in the stones. But those which are shortened are those who have indeed believed, and have the larger share of righteousness; yet they have also a considerable share of iniquity, and therefore they are shortened and not whole.\" \"But who are these, Lady, that are white and round, and yet do not fit into the building of the tower? \"She answered and said, \"How long will you be foolish and stupid, and continue to put every kind of question and understand nothing? These are those who have faith indeed, but they have also the riches of this world. When, therefore, tribulation comes, on account of their riches and business they deny the Lord.\"[fn-3-P342_58694:24-nf] I answered and said to her, \"When, then, will they be useful for the building, Lady? \"When the riches that now seduce them have been circumscribed, then will they be of use to God.[fn-3-P343_58898:25-nf] \"For as a round stone cannot become square unless portions be cut off and cast away, so also those who are rich in this world cannot be useful to the Lord unless their riches be cut down.

But as far as concerns our present undertaking, neither on Mount Sinai do I see how it appears, by all those things which were fearfully displayed to the senses of mortal men, whether God the Trinity spake, or the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Spirit severally. But if it is allowable, without rash assertion, to venture upon a modest and hesitating conjecture from this passage, if it is possible to understand it of one person of the Trinity, why do we not rather understand the Holy Spirit to be spoken of, since the Law itself also, which was given there, is said to have been written upon tables of stone with the finger of God,[fn-5-P589_218442:97-nf] by which name we know the Holy Spirit to be signified in the Gospel.[fn-5-P590_218529:98-nf] And fifty days are numbered from the slaying of the lamb and the celebration of the Passover until the day in which these things began to be done in Mount Sinai; just as after the passion of our Lord fifty days are numbered from His resurrection, and then came the Holy Spirit which the Son of God had promised. And in that very coming of His, which we read of in the Acts of the Apostles, there appeared cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them:[fn-5-P591_219014:99-nf] which agrees with Exodus, where it is written, \"And Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in fire;\" and a little after, \"And the sight of the glory of the Lord,\" he says, \"was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.\"[fn-5-P592_219331:100-nf] Or if these things were therefore wrought because neither the Father nor the Son could be there presented in that mode without the Holy Spirit, by whom the Law itself must needs be written; then we know doubtless that God appeared there, not by His own substance, which remains invisible and unchangeable, but by the appearance above mentioned of the creature; but that some special person of the Trinity appeared, distinguished by a proper mark, as far as my capacity of understanding reaches, we do not see.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"284","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1.

I am aware that a talebearer-a class of persons who do a great deal of harm-once told her as a kindness that owing to her great fervour in virtue some people thought her mad and declared that something should be done for her head.

Down to the very day of her death two things were conspicuous in her life, one her great patience and the other the jealousy which was manifested towards her. Now jealousy gnaws the heart of him who harbours it: and while it strives to injure its rival raves with all the force of its fury against itself.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":11,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_07_homily_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"24","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"8.

And this in you yet further moves my admiration, that you do not, according to the manners of the most part of the men of our time, propose your questions by way of mere test, but with the honest desire to arrive at the actual truth. There is no lack in these days of captious listeners and questioners; but to find a character desirous of information, and seeking the truth as a remedy for ignorance, is very difficult. Just as in the hunters snare, or in the soldier's ambush, the trick is generally ingeniously concealed, so it is with the inquiries of the majority of the questioners who advance arguments, not so much with the view of getting any good out of them, as in order that, in the event of their failing to elicit answers which chime in with their own desires, they may seem to have fair ground for controversy.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":11,"verse":32,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"177","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"66.[fn-18-P1856_483019:561-nf] Of the beliefs and practices whether generally accepted or publicly enjoined which are preserved in the Church[fn-18-P1857_483150:562-nf] some we possess derived from written teaching; others we have received delivered to us \"in a mystery\"[fn-18-P1858_483474:563-nf] by the tradition of the apostles; and both of these in relation to true religion have the same force. And these no one will gainsay;-no one, at all events, who is even moderately versed in the institutions of the Church. For were we to attempt to reject such customs as have no written authority, on the ground that the importance they possess is small, we should unintentionally injure the Gospel in its very vitals; or, rather, should make our public definition a mere phrase and nothing more.[fn-18-P1859_486470:564-nf] For instance, to take the first and most general example, who is thence who has taught us in writing to sign with the sign of the cross those who have trusted in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ? What writing has taught us to turn to the East at the prayer? Which of the saints has left us in writing the words of tim invocation at the displaying[fn-18-P1860_491290:565-nf] of the bread of the Eucharist and the cup of blessing? For we are not, as is well known, content with what the apostle or the Gospel has recorded, but both in preface and conclusion we add other words as being of great importance to the validity of the ministry, and these we derive from unwritten teaching. Moreover we bless the water of baptism andthe oil of the chrism, and besides this the catechumen who is being baptized. On what written authority do we do this? Is not our authority silent and mystical tradition? Nay, by what written word is the anointing of oil[fn-18-P1861_492104:566-nf] itself taught? And whence comes the custom of baptizing thrice?[fn-18-P1862_492340:567-nf] And as to the other customs of baptism from what Scripture do we derive the renunciation of Satan and his angels? Does not this come from that unpublished and secret teaching which oar fathers guarded in a silence out of the reach of curious meddling and inquisitive investigation? Well had they learnt the lesson that the awful dignity of the mysteries is best preserved by silence. What the uninitiated are not even allowed: to look at was hardly likely to be publiclyparaded about in written documents. What was the meaning of the mighty Moses in not making all the parts of the tabernacle open to every one? The profane he stationed without the sacred barriers; the first courts he conceded to the purer; the Levites alone he judged worthy of being servants of the Deity; sacrifices and burnt offerings and the rest of the priestly functions he allotted to the priests; one chosen out of all he admitted to the shrine, and even this one not always but on only one day in the year, and of this one day a time was fixed for his entry so that he might gaze on the Holy of Holies amazed at the strangeness and novelty of the sight. Moses was wise enough to know that contempt stretches to the trite and to the obvious, while a keen interest is naturally associated with the unusual and the unfamiliar. In the same manner the Apostles and Fathers who laid down laws for the Church from the beginning thus guarded the awful dignity of the mysteries in secrecy and silence, for what is bruited abroad random among the common folk is no mystery at all. This is the reason for our tradition of unwritten precepts and practices, that the knowledge of our dogmas may not become neglected and contemned by the multitude through familiarity. \"Dogma\" and \"Kerugma\" are two distinct things; the former is observed in silence; the latter is proclaimed to all the world. One form of this silence is the obscurity employed in Scripture, which makes the meaning of \"dogmas\" difficult to be understood for the very advantage of the reader: Thus we all look to the East[fn-18-P1863_496971:568-nf] at our prayers, but few of us know that we are seeking our own old country,[fn-18-P1864_497282:569-nf] Paradise, which God planted in Eden in the East.[fn-18-P1865_497529:570-nf] We pray standing,[fn-18-P1866_497603:571-nf] on the first day of the week, but we do not all know the reason. On the day of the resurrection (or \"standing again\" Grk. a0na/stasij we remind ourselves of the grace given to us by standing at prayer, not only because we rose with Christ,[fn-18-P1867_497868:572-nf] and are bound to \"seek those things which are above,\"[fn-18-P1868_497941:573-nf] but because the day seems to us to be in some sense an image of the age which we expect, wherefore, though it is the beginning of days, it is not called by Moses first, but one.[fn-18-P1869_498455:574-nf] For he says \"There was evening, and therewas morning, one day,\" as though the same day often recurred. Now \"one and \"eighth\" are the same, in itself distinctly indicating that really \"one\" and \"eighth\" of which the Psalmist makes mention in certain titles of the Psalms, the state which follows after this present time, the day which knows no waning or eventide, and no successor, that age which endeth not or groweth old.[fn-18-P1870_498922:575-nf] Of necessity, then, the church teaches her own foster children to offer their prayers on that day standing, to the end that through continual reminder of the endless life we may not neglect to make provision for our removal thither. Moreover all Pentecost is a reminder of the resurrection expected in the age to come. For that one and first day, if seven times multiplied by seven, completes the seven weeks of the holy Pentecost; for, beginning at the first, Pentecost ends with the same, making fifty revolutions through the like intervening days. And so it is a likeness of eternity, beginning as it does and ending, as in a circling course, at the same point. On this day the rules of the church have educated us to prefer the upright attitude of prayer, for by their plain reminder they, as It were, make our mind to dwell no longer in the present but in the future. Moreover every time we fall upon our knees and rise from off them we shew by the very deed that by our sin we fell down to earth, and by the loving kindness of our Creator were called hack to heaven.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":11,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_12_book_ii_","source_chapter":23,"source_paragraph":"103","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"In like manner, all who are described in the Scriptures as exhibiting in their present life good will and the actions of righteousness, and all whohave lived like them since, although lacking the same testimony of Scripture; or all who are even now so living, or shall hereafter so live: all these are great, they are all righteous, and they are all really worthy of praise, - yet they are by no means without sin: inasmuch as, on the authority of the same Scriptures which make us believe in their virtues, we believe also that in \"God's sight no man living is justified,\"[fn-8-P888_510375:100-nf] whence all ask that He will \"not enter into judgment with His servants:\"[fn-8-P889_510470:101-nf] and that not only to all the faithful in general, but to each of them in particular, the Lord's Prayer is necessary, which He delivered to His disciples.[fn-8-P890_510646:102-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_12_book_ii_","source_chapter":23,"source_paragraph":"103","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"In like manner, all who are described in the Scriptures as exhibiting in their present life good will and the actions of righteousness, and all whohave lived like them since, although lacking the same testimony of Scripture; or all who are even now so living, or shall hereafter so live: all these are great, they are all righteous, and they are all really worthy of praise, - yet they are by no means without sin: inasmuch as, on the authority of the same Scriptures which make us believe in their virtues, we believe also that in \"God's sight no man living is justified,\"[fn-8-P888_510375:100-nf] whence all ask that He will \"not enter into judgment with His servants:\"[fn-8-P889_510470:101-nf] and that not only to all the faithful in general, but to each of them in particular, the Lord's Prayer is necessary, which He delivered to His disciples.[fn-8-P890_510646:102-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_12_book_ii_","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"111","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Although there are some men who are so eminent in righteousness that God speaks to them out of His cloudy pillar, such as \"Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among them that call upon His name,\"[fn-9-P912_519077:112-nf] the latter of whom is much praised for his piety and purity in the Scriptures of truth, from his earliest childhood, in which his mother, to accomplish her vow, placed him in God's temple, and devoted him to the Lord as His servant;-yet even of such men it is written, \"Thou, O God, wast propitious unto them, though Thou didst punish all their devices.\"[fn-9-P913_519453:113-nf] Now the children of wrath God punishes in anger; whereas it is in mercy that He punishes the children of grace; since \"whom He loveth He correcteth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth.\"[fn-9-P914_519666:114-nf] However, there are no punishments, no correction, no scourge of God, but what are owing to sin, except in the case of Him who prepared His back for the smiter, in order that He might experience all things in our likeness without sin, in order that He might be the saintly Priest of saints, making intercession even for saints, who with no sacrifice of truth say each one even for himself, \"Forgive us our trespasses, even as we also forgive them that trespass against us.\"[fn-9-P915_520174:115-nf] Wherefore even our opponents in this controversy, whilst they are chaste in their life, and commendable in character, and although they do not hesitate to do that which the Lord enjoined on the rich man, who inquired of Him about the attainment of eternal life, after he had told Him, in answer to His first question, that he had already fully kept every commandment in the law, - that \"if he wished to be perfect, he must sell all that he had and give to the poor, and transfer his treasure to heaven;\"[fn-9-P916_520715:116-nf] yet they do not in any one instance venture to say that they are without sin.

It is one thing to fail at present in attaining to the fulness of love, and another thing to be swayed by no lust. A man ought therefore to abstain from every unlawful desire, although he loves God now far less than it is possible to love Him when He becomes an object of sight; just as in matters connected with the bodily senses, the eye can receive no pleasure from any kind of darkness, although it may be unable to look with a firm sight amidst refulgent light. Only let us see to it that we so constitute the soul of man in this corruptible body,that, although it has not yet swallowed up and consumed the motions of earthly lust in that super-eminent perfection of the love of God, it nevertheless, in that inferior righteousness to which we have referred, gives no consent to the aforesaid lust for the purpose of effecting any unlawful thing. In respect, therefore, of that immortal life, the commandment is even now applicable: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might;\"[fn-18-P1841_803645:387-nf] but in reference to the present life the following: \"Let not sin reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.\"[fn-18-P1842_803803:388-nf] To the one, again, belongs, \"Thou shalt not covet;\"[fn-18-P1843_803875:389-nf] to the other, \"Thou shalt not go after thy lusts.\"[fn-18-P1844_803945:390-nf] To the one it appertains to seek for nothing more than to continue in its perfect state; to the other it belongs actively to do the duty committed to it, and to hope as its reward for the perfection of the future life,-so that in the one the just man may live forevermore in the sight of that happiness which in this life was his object of desire; in the other, he may live by that faith whereon rests his desire for the ultimate blessedness as its certain end. (These things being so, it will be sin in the man who lives by faith ever to consent to an unlawful delight,-by committing not only frightful deeds and crimes, but even trifling faults; sinful, if he lend an ear to a word that ought not to be listened to, or a tongue to a phrase which shouldnot be uttered; sinful, if he entertains a thought in his heart in such a way as to wish that an evil pleasure were a lawful one, although known to be unlawful by the commandment,-for this amounts to a consent to sin, which would certainly be carried out in act, unless fear of punishment deterred.)[fn-18-P1845_805025:391-nf] Have such just men, while living by faith, no need to say: \"Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors?\"[fn-18-P1846_805344:392-nf] And do they prove this to be wrong which is written, \"In Thy sight shall no man living be justified?\"[fn-18-P1847_805466:393-nf] and this: \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us?\"[fn-18-P1848_805581:394-nf] and, \"There is no manthat sinneth not;\"[fn-18-P1849_805641:395-nf] and again, \"There is not on the earth a righteous man, who doeth good and sinneth not\"[fn-18-P1850_805753:396-nf] (for both these statements are expressed in a general future sense,-\"sinneth not,\" \"will not sin,\"-not in the past time, \"has not sinned\")?-and all other places of this purport contained in the Holy Scripture? Since, however, these passages cannot possibly be false, it plainly follows, to my mind, that whatever be the quality or extent of the righteousness which we may definitely ascribe to the present life, there is not a man living in it who is absolutely free from all sin; and that it is necessary for every one to give, that it may be given to him;[fn-18-P1851_806335:397-nf] and to forgive, that it may be forgiven him;[fn-18-P1852_806404:398-nf] and whatever righteousness he has, not to presume that he has it of himself, but from the grace of God, who justifies him, and still to go on hungering and thirsting for righteousness[fn-18-P1853_806607:399-nf] from Him who is the living bread,[fn-18-P1854_806660:400-nf] and with whom is the fountain of life;[fn-18-P1855_806719:401-nf] who works in His saints, whilst labouring amidst temptation in this life, their justification in such manner that He may still have somewhat to impart to them liberally when they ask, and something mercifully to forgive them when they confess.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_08_book_i_","source_chapter":31,"source_paragraph":"270","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"159.

Whence the apostle withal judges, and that in a case of fornication,[fn-13-P1328_361909:41-nf] that \"such a man must be surrendered to Satan for the destruction of the flesh; \"[fn-13-P1329_362041:42-nf] chiding them likewise because \"brethren\" were not \"judged at the bar of the saints: \"[fn-13-P1330_362145:43-nf] for he goes on and says, \"To what (purpose is it) for me to judge those who are without? \"\"But you remit, in order that remission may be granted you by God.\" The sins which are (thus) cleansed are such as a man may have committed against his brother, not against God. We profess, in short, in our prayer, that we will grant remission to our debtors;[fn-13-P1331_362527:44-nf] but it is not becoming to distend further, on the ground of the authority of such Scriptures, the cable of contention with alternate pull into diverse directions; so that one (Scripture) may seem to draw tight, another to relax, the reins of discipline-in uncertainty, as it were,-and the latter to debase the remedial aid of repentance through lenity, the former to refuse it through austerity. Further: the authority of Scripture will stand within its own limits, without reciprocal opposition. The remedial aid of repentance is determined by its own conditions, without unlimited concession; and the causes of it themselves are anteriorly distinguished without confusion in the proposition. We agree that the causes of repentance are sins. These we divide into two issues: some will be remissible, some irremissible: in accordance wherewith it will be doubtful to no one that some deserve chastisement, some condemnation. Every sin is dischargeable either by pardon or else by penalty: by pardon as the result of chastisement, by penalty as the result of condemnation. Touching this difference, we have not only already premised certain antithetical passages of the Scriptures, on one hand retaining, on the other remitting, sins;[fn-13-P1332_363778:45-nf] but John, too, will teach us: \"If any knoweth his brother to be sinning a sin not unto death, he shall request, and life shall be given to him; \"because he is not \"sinning unto death,\" this will be remissible. \"(There) is a sin unto death; not for this do I say that any is to request\"[fn-13-P1333_364088:46-nf] -this will be irremissible. So, where there is the efficacious power of \"making request,\" there likewise is that of remission: where there is no (efficacious power) of \"making request,\" there equally is none of remission either. According to this difference of sins, the condition of repentance also is discriminated. There will be a condition which may possibly obtain pardon,-in the case, namely, of a remissible sin: there will be a condition which can by no means obtain it,-in the case, namely, of an irremissible sin. And it remains to examine specially, with regard to the position of adultery and fornication, to which class of sins they ought to be assigned.","title":"VII.

You repeat the words bride, sister, mother, and affirm that all these are titles of the one Church and names applied to all believers. The fact goes against you. For if the Church admits but one rank, and has not many members in one body, what necessity is there for calling her bride, sister, mother? It must be that she is the bride of some, the sister of others, the mother of others. All indeed stand on the right hand, but one stands as a bridegroom, another as a brother, a third as a son.[fn-68-P6877_2193323:253-nf] \"My little children\" says the Apostle, \"of whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you.\" Do you think that the children who are being born and the apostle who is in travail are of equal rank? And the folly of your contention that we love all the members alike, and do not prefer the eye to the finger, nor the hand to the ear, but that if one be lost all mourn, is proved by the lesson which the apostle teaches the Corinthians:[fn-68-P6878_2193786:254-nf] \"Some members are more honourable, others excite the sense of shame: and those parts to which shame attaches are clothed with more abundant honour; whereas our comely parts have no need of our care.\" Do you think that the mouth and the belly, the eyes and the outlets of the body are to be classed together as of equal merit?[fn-68-P6879_2194138:255-nf] \"The lamp of thy body,\" he says, \"is thine eye. If thine eye be blinded, thy whole body is in darkness.\" If you cut off a finger, or the tip of the ear, there is indeed pain, but the loss is not so great, nor is the disfigurement attended by so much pain as it would be were you to take out the eyes, mutilate the nose, or saw through a bone. Some members we can dispense with and yet live: without others life is an impossibility. Some offences are light, some heavy. It is one thing to owe ten thousand talents, another to owe a farthing. We shall have to give account of the idle word no less than of adultery; but it is not the same thing to be put to the blush, and to be put upon the rack, to grow red in the face and to ensure lasting torment. Do you think I am merely expressing my own views?Hear what the Apostle John says:[fn-68-P6880_2194994:256-nf] \"He who knows that his brother sinneth a sin not unto death, let him ask, and he shall give him life, even to him that sinneth not unto death. But he that hath sinned unto death, who shall pray for him?\" You observe that if we entreat for smaller offences, we obtain pardon: if for greater ones, it is difficult to obtain our request: and that there is a great difference between sins. And so with respect to the people of Israel who had sinned a sin unto death, it is said to Jeremiah:[fn-68-P6881_2195502:257-nf] \"Pray not thou for this people, neither entreat for them, and do not withstand me, for I will not hear thee.\" Moreover, if it be true that we all alike enter the world and all alike leave it, and this is a precedent for the world to come, it follows that whether righteous or sinners we shall all be equally esteemed by God, because the conditions of our birth and death are now the same. And if you contend that there are two Adorns, the one of the earth, the other from heaven; and that they who were in the earthly Adam stand on the left hand, those who were in the heavenly are on the right hand, before we go further, let me ask you a question concerning two brothers: Was Esau in the earthly Adam, or in the heavenly? No one doubts that you will reply, he was in the earthly. In which was Jacob? Without hesitation you will say, in the heavenly. How then was he in the heavenly when Christ had not yet come in the flesh-Christ who is called the second Adam from heaven? You must either reckon all before the incarnation of Christ in the old Adam, and even the just in the man from the earth, and then they will be on the left among your goats; or, if it be impious to give Isaac the same place as Ishmael, Jacob as Esau, the saints as sinners, the last Adam will date from the time when Christ was born of a Virgin, and your argument from the two Adams will not benefit your sheep and goats, because we have proved that in the first Adam there were both sheep and goats, and that of those who were in one and the same man, some stood on the right hand of God, others on the left:[fn-68-P6882_2197109:258-nf] \"For from Adam even until Moses death reigned over all, even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adam's transgression.\"","title":"Book II.","author":false},{"chapter":11,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_21_viii_on_fasting_in_opposition_to_the_psychics_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"68","folder":"ANF-04","text":"How unworthy, also, is the way in which you interpret to the favour of your own lust the fact that the Lord \"ate and drank\" promiscuously!

The old woman (in the Gospel)[fn-32-P3295_1163669:134-nf] had lost one of her ten pieces of silver, and therefore she sought it;[fn-32-P3296_1163758:135-nf] when, however, she found it, she ceased to look for it. The neighbour was without bread, and therefore he knocked; but as soon as the door was opened to him, and he received the bread, he discontinued knocking.[fn-32-P3297_1163988:136-nf] The widow kept asking to be heard by the judge, because she was not admitted; but when her suit was heard, thenceforth she was silent.[fn-32-P3298_1164142:137-nf] So that there is a limit both to seeking, and to knocking, and to asking. \"For to every one that asketh,\" says He, \"it shall be given, and to him that knocketh it shall be opened, and by him that seeketh it shall be found.\"[fn-32-P3299_1164390:138-nf] Away with the man[fn-33-P3300_1164427:139-nf] who is ever seeking because he never finds; for he seeks there where nothing can be found. Away with him who is always knocking because it will never be opened to him; for he knocks where there is none (to open). Away with him who is always asking because he will never be heard; for he asks of one who does not hear.","title":"The Prescription Against Heretics.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":11,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_15_book_iii_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"40","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"11.

This law was given to the Jews in the ten commandments, which they call the Decalogue. And these commandments, again, are reduced to two, namely that we should love God with all our heart, with all our soul, with all our mind; and that we should love our neighbor as ourselves.[fn-30-P3043_1422086:143-nf] For that on these two precepts hang all the law and the prophets, the Lord Himself has at once declared in the Gospel and shown in His own example.

The bitter waters are sweetened by wood, as hostile people become friendly by learning to honor the cross of Christ. The twelve fountains watering the seventy palm trees are a figure of apostolic grace watering the nations. As seven is mutiplied by ten, so the decalogue is fulfilled in the sevenfold operation of the Spirit. The enemy attempting to stop them in their way is overcome by Moses stretching out his hands in the figure of the cross. The deadly bites of serpents are healed by the brazen serpent, which was lifted up that they might look at it.

The evangelist, in reference to this, quotes the words, \"A bone of Him shall not be broken.\"[fn-14-P1459_784901:52-nf] The posts were marked with blood to keep away destruction, as people are marked on their foreheads with the sign of the Lord's passion for their salvation. The law was given on the fiftieth day after the passover; so the Holy Spirit came on the fiftieth day after the passion of the Lord. The law is said to have been written with the finger of God; and the Lord says of the Holy Spirit, \"With the finger of God I cast out devils.\"[fn-14-P1460_785352:53-nf] Such are the Scriptures in which Faustus, after shutting his eyes, declares that he can see no prediction of Christ.

But most foolishly did our Pontic heresiarch act in this too. As if it would not be more readily believed that flesh in the Divine Being should rather be unborn than untrue, this belief having in fact had the way mainly prepared for it by the Creator's angels when they conversed in flesh which was real, although unborn. For indeed the notorious Philumena[fn-49-P4943_1562274:145-nf] persuaded Apelles and the other seceders from Marcion rather to believe that Christ did really carry about a body of flesh; not derived to Him, however, from birth, but one which He borrowed from the elements. Now, as Marcion was apprehensive that a belief of the fleshly body would also involve a belief of birth, undoubtedly He who seemed to be man was believed to be verily and indeed born. For a certain woman had exclaimed, \"Blessed is the womb that bare Thee, and the paps which Thou hast sucked!\"[fn-49-P4944_1563133:146-nf] And how else could they have said that His mother and His brethren were standing without?[fn-49-P4945_1563243:147-nf] But we shall see more of this in the proper place.[fn-49-P4946_1563316:148-nf] Surely, when He also proclaimed Himself as the Son of man, He, without doubt, confessed that He had been born. Now I would rather refer all these points to an examination of the gospel; but still, as I have already stated, if he, who seemed to be man, had by all means to pass as having been born, it was vain for him to suppose that faith in his nativity was to be perfected[fn-49-P4947_1563750:149-nf] by the device of an imaginary flesh. For what advantage was there in that being not true which was held to be true, whether it were his flesh or his birth? Or if you should say, let human opinion go for nothing;[fn-49-P4948_1564039:150-nf] you are then honouring your god under the shelter of a deception, since he knew himself to be something different from what he had made men to think of him. In that case you might possibly have assigned to him a putative nativity even, and so not have hung the question on this point. For silly women fancy themselves pregnant sometimes, when they are corpulent[fn-49-P4949_1564431:151-nf] either from their natural flux[fn-49-P4950_1564479:152-nf] or from some other malady. And, no doubt, it had become his duty, since he had put on the mere mask of his substance, to act out from its earliest scene the play of his phantasy, lest he should have failed in his part at the beginning of the flesh. You have, of course,[fn-49-P4951_1564775:153-nf] rejected the sham of a nativity, and have produced true flesh itself. And, no doubt, even the real nativity of a God is a most mean thing.[fn-49-P4952_1564945:154-nf] Come then, wind up your cavils[fn-49-P4953_1564996:155-nf] against the most sacred and reverend works of nature; inveigh against all that you are; destroy the origin of flesh and life; call the womb a sewer of the illustrious animal-in other words, the manufactory for the production of man; dilate on the impure and shameful tortures of parturition, and then on the filthy, troublesome, contemptible issues of the puerperal labour itself! But yet, after you have pulled all these things down to infamy, that you may affirm them to be unworthy of God, birth will not be worse for Him than death, infancy than the cross, punishment than nature, condemnation than the flesh. If Christ truly suffered all this, to be born was a less thing for Him. If Christ suffered evasively,[fn-49-P4954_1565727:156-nf] as a phantom; evasively, too, might He have been born. Such are Marcion's chief arguments by which he makes out another Christ; and I think that we show plainly enough that they are utterly irrelevant, when we teach how much more truly consistent with God is the reality rather than the falsehood of that condition[fn-49-P4955_1566059:157-nf] in which He manifested His Christ.

You describe the one as choosing the latter and plunging without hesitation into the deep, while the other, refusing both, shews quite as much abhorrence of the worship of idols as his companion, but declines to commit himself to the waves, and waits for this fate to be violently forced upon him. You have suggested these circumstances, and you ask which of these two took the better course. I think that you will agree with me that the latter was the more praiseworthy. No one ought to withdraw himself from life unbidden, but should await either a natural or a violent death. Our Lord gave us this lesson when He bade those that are persecuted in one city flee to another and again commanded them to quit even this and depart to another.[fn-53-P5347_1287315:5-nf] In obedience to this teaching the divine Apostle escaped the violence of the governor of the city, and had no hesitation in speaking of the manner of his flight, but spoke of the basket, the wall, and the window, and boasted and glorified in the act.[fn-53-P5348_1287583:6-nf] For what looks discreditable is made honourable by the divine command. In the same manner the Apostle called himself at one time a Pharisee[fn-53-P5349_1288112:7-nf] and at another a Roman,[fn-53-P5350_1288154:8-nf] not because he was afraid of death, but acting quite fairly in fight.[fn-53-P5351_1288242:9-nf] In the same way when he had learnt the Jews' plot against him he appealed to Caesar[fn-53-P5352_1288391:10-nf] and sent his sister's son to the chief captain to report the designs hatched against him, not because he clung to this present life, but in obedience to the divine law. For assuredly our Lord does not wish us to throw ourselves into obvious peril; and this is taught us by deed as well as by word, for more than once He avoided the murderous violence of the Jews. And the great Peter, first of the Apostles, when he was loosed from his chains and had escaped from the hands of Herod, came to the house of John, who was surnamed Mark, and after removing the anxiety of his friends by his visit and bidding them maintain silence, betook himself to another house in the endeavour to conceal himself more effectually by the removal.[fn-53-P5353_1289139:11-nf] And we shall find just the same kind of wisdom in the old Testament, for the famous Moses, after playing the man in his struggle with the Egyptian and finding out the next day that the homicide had become known, ran away, travelled a long journey, and arrived at the land of Midian.[fn-53-P5354_1289446:12-nf] In like manner the great Elias when he had learnt Jezebel's threats did not give himself up to them which wished to kill him, but left the world and hurried to the desert.[fn-53-P5355_1289641:13-nf] And if it is right and agreeable to God to escape the violence of our enemies, surely it is much more right to refuse to obey them when they order a man to become his own murderer. Our Lord did not give in to the devil when he bade Him throw Himself down,[fn-53-P5356_1289923:14-nf] and when he had armed against Him the hands of the Jews by means of the scourge and the thorns and the nails, and the creature was urging Him to bring wholesale destruction on His wicked foes, the Lord Himself forbade, because He knew that His Passion was bringing salvation to the world, and it was for this reason that just before His Passion He said to His Apostles \"Pray that ye enter not into temptation,\"[fn-53-P5357_1290352:15-nf] and taught us to pray \"Lead us not into temptation.\"[fn-53-P5358_1290426:16-nf] Now let us shift our ground a little, and we shall see our way more clearly. Let us eliminate the sea from the argument, and suppose the judge to have given each of the martyrs a sword, and ordered the one who refused to sacrifice to cut off his own head; who in his senses would have endured to redden his hand with his own blood, become his own headsman, lift his hand against himself, in obedience to the judge's order?","title":"Letters of the Blessed Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":11,"verse":26,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_23_letters_of_the_blessed_theodoret_bishop_of_cyrus","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"443","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"In reality and by nature it is the God of all, and His only-begotten Son and the Holy Spirit which are God. This is distinctly taught us by the admirable Paul in the words \"For though there be that are called gods whether in heaven or in earth, as there are gods many and lords many, but to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in Him; and one Lord by whom are all things and we by Him.\"[fn-64-P6407_1643171:487-nf] And the Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of God and so also is the soul of man, for, it is written, \"His breath goeth forth,\"[fn-64-P6408_1643338:488-nf] and \"O ye spirits and souls of the righteous bless ye the Lord,\"[fn-64-P6409_1643426:489-nf] and the Psalmist David called the angels spirits. \"Who maketh His angels spirits and His ministers a flame of fire.\"[fn-64-P6410_1643586:490-nf] Why indeed do I mention the angels and the souls of men?

Thus though many are named fathers, we worship one Father, the Father before the ages, who Himself gave this title to men, as the Apostle says, \"For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom every fatherhood in heaven and earth is named.\"[fn-64-P6412_1644552:492-nf] Let us not then, because others are called christs, rob ourselves of the worship of our Lord Jesus Christ. For just as though many are called gods and fathers, there is one God and Father over all and before the ages;and though many are called sons, there is one real and natural Son; and though many are styled spirits there is one Holy Ghost; just so though many are called christs there is one Lord Jesus Christ by Whom are all things. And very properly does the Church cling to this name; for she has heard Paul, escorter of the Bride, exclaiming \"I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ,\"[fn-64-P6413_1645336:493-nf] and again \"Husbands love your wives as Christ also loved the Church,\"[fn-64-P6414_1645429:494-nf] and again \"For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.

Moreover, He says again, \"As water extinguisheth fire, so almsgiving quencheth sin.\"[fn-74-P7486_2491393:7-nf] Here also it is shown and proved, that as in the layer of saving water the fire of Gehenna is extinguished, so by almsgiving and works of righteousness the flame of sins is subdued. And because in baptism remission of sins is granted once for all, constant and ceaseless labour, following the likeness of baptism, once again bestows the mercy of God. The Lord teaches this also in the Gospel. For when the disciples were pointed out, as eating and not first washing their hands, He replied and said, \"He that made that which is within, made also that which is without. But give alms, and behold all things are clean unto you; \"[fn-74-P7487_2492041:8-nf] teaching hereby and showing, that not the hands are to be washed, but the heart, and that the foulness from inside is to be done away rather than that from outside; but that he who shall have cleansed what is within has cleansed also that which is without; and that if the mind is cleansed, a man has begun to be clean also in skin and body. Further, admonishing, and showing whence we may be clean and purged, He added that alms must be given. He who is pitiful teaches and warns us that pity must be shown; and because He seeks to save those whom at a great cost He has redeemed, He teaches that those who, after the grace of baptism, have become foul, may once more be cleansed.","title":"Treatise VIII.

For He says, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God[fn-24-P2433_686318:54-nf] . And that this grace is from the Father, He thus states, How much more shall your heavenly Father' give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him[fn-24-P2434_686478:55-nf] . And that we ought to worship God in the Spirit, He shews thus, But the hour cometh and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in Spirit and in truth; for the Father also seeketh such to warship Him.

Now, he who had advanced such a conjecture as this should first show that another god had been proclaimed by Christ. For nobody would have wanted to know how to pray, before he had learned whom he was to pray to. If, however, he had already learned this, prove it. If you find nowhere any proof, let me tell you[fn-63-P6362_1885186:1048-nf] that it was to the Creator that he asked for instruction in prayer, to whom John's disciples also used to pray. But, inasmuch as John had introduced some new order of prayer, this disciple had not improperly presumed to think that he ought also to ask of Christ whether they too must not (according to some special rule of their Master) pray, not indeed to another god, but in another manner. Christ accordingly[fn-63-P6363_1885615:1049-nf] would not have taught His disciple prayer before He had given him the knowledge of God Himself. Therefore what He actually taught was prayer to Him whom the disciple had already known. In short, you may discover in the import[fn-63-P6364_1885859:1050-nf] of the prayer what God is addressed therein. To whom can I say, \"Father? \"[fn-63-P6365_1885951:1051-nf] To him who had nothing to do with making me, from whom I do not derive my origin? Or to Him, who, by making and fashioning me, became my parent?[fn-63-P6366_1886117:1052-nf] Of whom can I ask for His Holy Spirit? Of him who gives not even the mundane spirit;[fn-63-P6367_1886222:1053-nf] or of Him \"who maketh His angels spirits,\" and whose Spirit it was which in the beginning hovered upon the waters.[fn-63-P6368_1886396:1054-nf] Whose kingdom shall I wish to come-his, of whom I never heard as the king of glory; or His, in whose hand are even the hearts of kings? Who shall give me my daily[fn-63-P6369_1886579:1055-nf] bread? Shall it be he who produces for me not a grain of millet-seed;[fn-63-P6370_1886670:1056-nf] or He who even from heaven gave to His people day by day the bread of angels?[fn-63-P6371_1886765:1057-nf] Who shall forgive me my trespasses?[fn-63-P6372_1886826:1058-nf] He who, by refusing to judge them, does not retain them; or He who, unless He forgives them, will retain them, even to His judgment? Who shall suffer us not to be led into temptation? He before whom the tempter will never be able to tremble; or He who from the beginning has beforehand condemned[fn-63-P6373_1887143:1059-nf] the angel tempter? If any one, with such a form,[fn-63-P6374_1887215:1060-nf] invokes another god and not the Creator, he does not pray; he only blasphemes.[fn-63-P6375_1887315:1061-nf] In like manner, from whom must I ask that I may receive? Of whom seek, that I may find? To whom knock, that it may be opened to me?[fn-63-P6376_1887465:1062-nf] Who has to give to him that asks, but He to whom all things belong, and whose am I also that am the asker? What, however, have I lost before that other god, that I should seek of him and find it. If it be wisdom and prudence, it is the Creator who has hidden them. Shall I resort to him, then, in quest of them? If it be health[fn-63-P6377_1887814:1063-nf] and life, they are at the disposal of the Creator. Nor must anything be sought and found anywhere else than there, where it is kept in secret that it may come to light. So, again, at no other door will I knock than at that out of which my privilege has reached me.[fn-63-P6378_1888117:1064-nf] In fine, if to receive, and to find, and to be admitted, is the fruit of labour and earnestness to him who has asked, and sought, and knocked, understand that these duties have been enjoined, and results promised, by the Creator. As for that most excellent god of yours, coming as he professes gratuitously to help man, who was not his (creature),[fn-63-P6379_1888594:1065-nf] he could not have imposed upon him any labour, or (endowed him with) any earnestness. For he would by this time cease to be the most excellent god, were he not spontaneously to give to every one who does not ask, and permit every one who seeks not to find, and open to every one who does not knock. The Creator, on the contrary,[fn-63-P6380_1888963:1066-nf] was able to proclaim these duties and rewards by Christ, in order that man, who by sinning had offended his God, might toil on (in his probation), and by his perseverance in asking might receive, and in seeking might find, and in knocking might enter. Accordingly, the preceding similitude[fn-63-P6381_1889269:1067-nf] represents the man who went at night and begged for the loaves, in the light of a friend and not a stranger, and makes him knock at a friend's house and not at a stranger's. But even if he has offended, man is more of a friend with the Creator than with the god of Marcion. At His door, therefore, does he knock to whom he had the right of access; whose gate he had found; whom he knew to possess bread; in bed now with His children, whom He had willed to be born.[fn-63-P6382_1889761:1068-nf] Even though the knocking is late in the day, it is yet the Creator's time. To Him belongs the latest hour who owns an entire age[fn-63-P6383_1890055:1069-nf] and the end thereof. As for the new god, however, no one could have knocked at his door late, for he has hardly yet[fn-63-P6384_1890190:1070-nf] seen the light of morning. It is the Creator, who once shut the door to the Gentiles, which was then knocked at by the Jews, that both rises and gives, if not now to man as a friend, yet not as a stranger, but, as He says, \"because of his importunity.\"[fn-63-P6385_1890484:1071-nf] Importunate, however, the recent god could not have permitted any one to be in the short time (since his appearance).[fn-63-P6386_1890623:1072-nf] Him, therefore, whom you call the Creator recognise also as \"Father.\" It is even He who knows what His children require. For when they asked for bread, He gave them manna from heaven; and when they wanted flesh, He sent them abundance of quails-not a serpent for a fish, nor for an egg a scorpion.[fn-63-P6387_1890940:1073-nf] It will, however, appertain to Him not to give evil instead of good, who has both one and the other in His power. Marcion's god, on the contrary, not having a scorpion, was unable to refuse to give what he did not possess; only He (could do so), who, having a scorpion, yet gives it not. In like manner, it is He who will give the Holy Spirit, at whose command[fn-63-P6388_1891326:1074-nf] is also the unholy spirit. When He cast out the \"demon which was dumb\"[fn-63-P6389_1891417:1075-nf] (and by a cure of this sort verified Isaiah),[fn-63-P6390_1891485:1076-nf] and having been charged with casting out demons by Beelzebub, He said, \"If I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? \"[fn-63-P6391_1891654:1077-nf] By such a question what does He otherwise mean, than that He ejects the spirits by the same power by which their sons also did-that is, by the power of the Creator? For if you suppose the meaning to be, \"If I by Beelzebub, etc., by whom your sons? \"-as if He would reproach them with having the power of Beelzebub,-you are met at once by the preceding sentence, that \"Satan cannot be divided against himself.\"[fn-63-P6392_1892086:1078-nf] So that it was not by Beelzebub that even they were casting out demons, but (as we have said) by the power of the Creator; and that He might make this understood, He adds: \"But if I with the finger of God cast out demons, is not the kingdom of God come near unto you? \"[fn-63-P6393_1892378:1079-nf] For the magicians who stood before Pharaoh and resisted Moses called the power of the Creator\"the finger of God.\"[fn-63-P6394_1892514:1080-nf] It was the finger of God, because it was a sign[fn-63-P6395_1892585:1081-nf] that even a thing of weakness was yet abundant in strength. This Christ also showed, when, recalling to notice (and not obliterating) those ancient wonders which were really His own,[fn-63-P6396_1892791:1082-nf] He said that the power of God must be understood to be the finger of none other God than Him, under[fn-63-P6397_1892928:1083-nf] whom it had received this appellation. His kingdom, therefore, was come near to them, whose power was called His \"finger.\" Well, therefore, did He connect[fn-63-P6398_1893098:1084-nf] with the parable of \"the strong man armed,\" whom \"a stronger man still overcame,\"[fn-63-P6399_1893200:1085-nf] the prince of the demons, whom He had already called Beelzebub and Satan; signifying that it was he who was overcome by the finger of God, and not that the Creator had been subdued by another god. Besides,[fn-64-P6400_1893431:1086-nf] how could His kingdom be still standing, with its boundaries, and laws, and functions, whom, even if the whole world were left entire to Him, Marcion's god could possibly seem to have overcome as \"the stronger than He,\" if it were not in consequence of His law that even Marcionites were constantly dying, by returning in their dissolution[fn-64-P6401_1893789:1087-nf] to the ground, and were so often admonished by even a scorpion, that the Creator had by no means been overcome?[fn-64-P6402_1893921:1088-nf] \"A (certain) mother of the company exclaims, `Blessed is the womb that bare Thee, and the paps which Thou hast sucked; 'but the Lord said, `Yea, rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.'\"[fn-64-P6403_1894392:1089-nf] Now He had in precisely similar terms rejected His mother or His brethren, whilst preferring those who heard and obeyed God.[fn-64-P6404_1894542:1090-nf] His mother, however, was not here present with Him.

For nobody would have wanted to know how to pray, before he had learned whom he was to pray to. If, however, he had already learned this, prove it. If you find nowhere any proof, let me tell you[fn-63-P6362_1885186:1048-nf] that it was to the Creator that he asked for instruction in prayer, to whom John's disciples also used to pray. But, inasmuch as John had introduced some new order of prayer, this disciple had not improperly presumed to think that he ought also to ask of Christ whether they too must not (according to some special rule of their Master) pray, not indeed to another god, but in another manner. Christ accordingly[fn-63-P6363_1885615:1049-nf] would not have taught His disciple prayer before He had given him the knowledge of God Himself. Therefore what He actually taught was prayer to Him whom the disciple had already known. In short, you may discover in the import[fn-63-P6364_1885859:1050-nf] of the prayer what God is addressed therein. To whom can I say, \"Father? \"[fn-63-P6365_1885951:1051-nf] To him who had nothing to do with making me, from whom I do not derive my origin? Or to Him, who, by making and fashioning me, became my parent?[fn-63-P6366_1886117:1052-nf] Of whom can I ask for His Holy Spirit? Of him who gives not even the mundane spirit;[fn-63-P6367_1886222:1053-nf] or of Him \"who maketh His angels spirits,\" and whose Spirit it was which in the beginning hovered upon the waters.[fn-63-P6368_1886396:1054-nf] Whose kingdom shall I wish to come-his, of whom I never heard as the king of glory; or His, in whose hand are even the hearts of kings? Who shall give me my daily[fn-63-P6369_1886579:1055-nf] bread? Shall it be he who produces for me not a grain of millet-seed;[fn-63-P6370_1886670:1056-nf] or He who even from heaven gave to His people day by day the bread of angels?[fn-63-P6371_1886765:1057-nf] Who shall forgive me my trespasses?[fn-63-P6372_1886826:1058-nf] He who, by refusing to judge them, does not retain them; or He who, unless He forgives them, will retain them, even to His judgment? Who shall suffer us not to be led into temptation? He before whom the tempter will never be able to tremble; or He who from the beginning has beforehand condemned[fn-63-P6373_1887143:1059-nf] the angel tempter? If any one, with such a form,[fn-63-P6374_1887215:1060-nf] invokes another god and not the Creator, he does not pray; he only blasphemes.[fn-63-P6375_1887315:1061-nf] In like manner, from whom must I ask that I may receive? Of whom seek, that I may find? To whom knock, that it may be opened to me?[fn-63-P6376_1887465:1062-nf] Who has to give to him that asks, but He to whom all things belong, and whose am I also that am the asker? What, however, have I lost before that other god, that I should seek of him and find it. If it be wisdom and prudence, it is the Creator who has hidden them. Shall I resort to him, then, in quest of them? If it be health[fn-63-P6377_1887814:1063-nf] and life, they are at the disposal of the Creator. Nor must anything be sought and found anywhere else than there, where it is kept in secret that it may come to light. So, again, at no other door will I knock than at that out of which my privilege has reached me.[fn-63-P6378_1888117:1064-nf] In fine, if to receive, and to find, and to be admitted, is the fruit of labour and earnestness to him who has asked, and sought, and knocked, understand that these duties have been enjoined, and results promised, by the Creator. As for that most excellent god of yours, coming as he professes gratuitously to help man, who was not his (creature),[fn-63-P6379_1888594:1065-nf] he could not have imposed upon him any labour, or (endowed him with) any earnestness. For he would by this time cease to be the most excellent god, were he not spontaneously to give to every one who does not ask, and permit every one who seeks not to find, and open to every one who does not knock. The Creator, on the contrary,[fn-63-P6380_1888963:1066-nf] was able to proclaim these duties and rewards by Christ, in order that man, who by sinning had offended his God, might toil on (in his probation), and by his perseverance in asking might receive, and in seeking might find, and in knocking might enter. Accordingly, the preceding similitude[fn-63-P6381_1889269:1067-nf] represents the man who went at night and begged for the loaves, in the light of a friend and not a stranger, and makes him knock at a friend's house and not at a stranger's. But even if he has offended, man is more of a friend with the Creator than with the god of Marcion. At His door, therefore, does he knock to whom he had the right of access; whose gate he had found; whom he knew to possess bread; in bed now with His children, whom He had willed to be born.[fn-63-P6382_1889761:1068-nf] Even though the knocking is late in the day, it is yet the Creator's time. To Him belongs the latest hour who owns an entire age[fn-63-P6383_1890055:1069-nf] and the end thereof. As for the new god, however, no one could have knocked at his door late, for he has hardly yet[fn-63-P6384_1890190:1070-nf] seen the light of morning. It is the Creator, who once shut the door to the Gentiles, which was then knocked at by the Jews, that both rises and gives, if not now to man as a friend, yet not as a stranger, but, as He says, \"because of his importunity.\"[fn-63-P6385_1890484:1071-nf] Importunate, however, the recent god could not have permitted any one to be in the short time (since his appearance).[fn-63-P6386_1890623:1072-nf] Him, therefore, whom you call the Creator recognise also as \"Father.\" It is even He who knows what His children require. For when they asked for bread, He gave them manna from heaven; and when they wanted flesh, He sent them abundance of quails-not a serpent for a fish, nor for an egg a scorpion.[fn-63-P6387_1890940:1073-nf] It will, however, appertain to Him not to give evil instead of good, who has both one and the other in His power. Marcion's god, on the contrary, not having a scorpion, was unable to refuse to give what he did not possess; only He (could do so), who, having a scorpion, yet gives it not. In like manner, it is He who will give the Holy Spirit, at whose command[fn-63-P6388_1891326:1074-nf] is also the unholy spirit. When He cast out the \"demon which was dumb\"[fn-63-P6389_1891417:1075-nf] (and by a cure of this sort verified Isaiah),[fn-63-P6390_1891485:1076-nf] and having been charged with casting out demons by Beelzebub, He said, \"If I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? \"[fn-63-P6391_1891654:1077-nf] By such a question what does He otherwise mean, than that He ejects the spirits by the same power by which their sons also did-that is, by the power of the Creator? For if you suppose the meaning to be, \"If I by Beelzebub, etc., by whom your sons? \"-as if He would reproach them with having the power of Beelzebub,-you are met at once by the preceding sentence, that \"Satan cannot be divided against himself.\"[fn-63-P6392_1892086:1078-nf] So that it was not by Beelzebub that even they were casting out demons, but (as we have said) by the power of the Creator; and that He might make this understood, He adds: \"But if I with the finger of God cast out demons, is not the kingdom of God come near unto you? \"[fn-63-P6393_1892378:1079-nf] For the magicians who stood before Pharaoh and resisted Moses called the power of the Creator\"the finger of God.\"[fn-63-P6394_1892514:1080-nf] It was the finger of God, because it was a sign[fn-63-P6395_1892585:1081-nf] that even a thing of weakness was yet abundant in strength. This Christ also showed, when, recalling to notice (and not obliterating) those ancient wonders which were really His own,[fn-63-P6396_1892791:1082-nf] He said that the power of God must be understood to be the finger of none other God than Him, under[fn-63-P6397_1892928:1083-nf] whom it had received this appellation. His kingdom, therefore, was come near to them, whose power was called His \"finger.\" Well, therefore, did He connect[fn-63-P6398_1893098:1084-nf] with the parable of \"the strong man armed,\" whom \"a stronger man still overcame,\"[fn-63-P6399_1893200:1085-nf] the prince of the demons, whom He had already called Beelzebub and Satan; signifying that it was he who was overcome by the finger of God, and not that the Creator had been subdued by another god. Besides,[fn-64-P6400_1893431:1086-nf] how could His kingdom be still standing, with its boundaries, and laws, and functions, whom, even if the whole world were left entire to Him, Marcion's god could possibly seem to have overcome as \"the stronger than He,\" if it were not in consequence of His law that even Marcionites were constantly dying, by returning in their dissolution[fn-64-P6401_1893789:1087-nf] to the ground, and were so often admonished by even a scorpion, that the Creator had by no means been overcome?[fn-64-P6402_1893921:1088-nf] \"A (certain) mother of the company exclaims, `Blessed is the womb that bare Thee, and the paps which Thou hast sucked; 'but the Lord said, `Yea, rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.'\"[fn-64-P6403_1894392:1089-nf] Now He had in precisely similar terms rejected His mother or His brethren, whilst preferring those who heard and obeyed God.[fn-64-P6404_1894542:1090-nf] His mother, however, was not here present with Him. On that former occasion, therefore, He had not denied that He was her son by birth.[fn-64-P6405_1894716:1091-nf] On hearing this (salutation) the second time, He the second time transferred, as He had done before,[fn-64-P6406_1894834:1092-nf] the \"blessedness\" to His disciples from the womb and the paps of His mother, from whom, however, unless He had in her (a real mother) He could not have transferred it.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":11,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"102","folder":"ANF-03","text":"When in a certain place he had been praying to that Father above,[fn-63-P6360_1884376:1046-nf] looking up with insolent and audacious eyes to the heaven of the Creator, by whom in His rough and cruel nature he might have been crushed with hail and lightning-just as it was by Him contrived that he was (afterwards) attached to a cross[fn-63-P6361_1884637:1047-nf] at Jerusalem-one of his disciples came to him and said, \"Master, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.\" This he said, forsooth, because he thought that different prayers were required for different gods!

If any one, with such a form,[fn-63-P6374_1887215:1060-nf] invokes another god and not the Creator, he does not pray; he only blasphemes.[fn-63-P6375_1887315:1061-nf] In like manner, from whom must I ask that I may receive? Of whom seek, that I may find? To whom knock, that it may be opened to me?[fn-63-P6376_1887465:1062-nf] Who has to give to him that asks, but He to whom all things belong, and whose am I also that am the asker? What, however, have I lost before that other god, that I should seek of him and find it. If it be wisdom and prudence, it is the Creator who has hidden them. Shall I resort to him, then, in quest of them? If it be health[fn-63-P6377_1887814:1063-nf] and life, they are at the disposal of the Creator. Nor must anything be sought and found anywhere else than there, where it is kept in secret that it may come to light. So, again, at no other door will I knock than at that out of which my privilege has reached me.[fn-63-P6378_1888117:1064-nf] In fine, if to receive, and to find, and to be admitted, is the fruit of labour and earnestness to him who has asked, and sought, and knocked, understand that these duties have been enjoined, and results promised, by the Creator. As for that most excellent god of yours, coming as he professes gratuitously to help man, who was not his (creature),[fn-63-P6379_1888594:1065-nf] he could not have imposed upon him any labour, or (endowed him with) any earnestness. For he would by this time cease to be the most excellent god, were he not spontaneously to give to every one who does not ask, and permit every one who seeks not to find, and open to every one who does not knock. The Creator, on the contrary,[fn-63-P6380_1888963:1066-nf] was able to proclaim these duties and rewards by Christ, in order that man, who by sinning had offended his God, might toil on (in his probation), and by his perseverance in asking might receive, and in seeking might find, and in knocking might enter. Accordingly, the preceding similitude[fn-63-P6381_1889269:1067-nf] represents the man who went at night and begged for the loaves, in the light of a friend and not a stranger, and makes him knock at a friend's house and not at a stranger's. But even if he has offended, man is more of a friend with the Creator than with the god of Marcion. At His door, therefore, does he knock to whom he had the right of access; whose gate he had found; whom he knew to possess bread; in bed now with His children, whom He had willed to be born.[fn-63-P6382_1889761:1068-nf] Even though the knocking is late in the day, it is yet the Creator's time. To Him belongs the latest hour who owns an entire age[fn-63-P6383_1890055:1069-nf] and the end thereof. As for the new god, however, no one could have knocked at his door late, for he has hardly yet[fn-63-P6384_1890190:1070-nf] seen the light of morning. It is the Creator, who once shut the door to the Gentiles, which was then knocked at by the Jews, that both rises and gives, if not now to man as a friend, yet not as a stranger, but, as He says, \"because of his importunity.\"[fn-63-P6385_1890484:1071-nf] Importunate, however, the recent god could not have permitted any one to be in the short time (since his appearance).[fn-63-P6386_1890623:1072-nf] Him, therefore, whom you call the Creator recognise also as \"Father.\" It is even He who knows what His children require. For when they asked for bread, He gave them manna from heaven; and when they wanted flesh, He sent them abundance of quails-not a serpent for a fish, nor for an egg a scorpion.[fn-63-P6387_1890940:1073-nf] It will, however, appertain to Him not to give evil instead of good, who has both one and the other in His power. Marcion's god, on the contrary, not having a scorpion, was unable to refuse to give what he did not possess; only He (could do so), who, having a scorpion, yet gives it not. In like manner, it is He who will give the Holy Spirit, at whose command[fn-63-P6388_1891326:1074-nf] is also the unholy spirit. When He cast out the \"demon which was dumb\"[fn-63-P6389_1891417:1075-nf] (and by a cure of this sort verified Isaiah),[fn-63-P6390_1891485:1076-nf] and having been charged with casting out demons by Beelzebub, He said, \"If I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? \"[fn-63-P6391_1891654:1077-nf] By such a question what does He otherwise mean, than that He ejects the spirits by the same power by which their sons also did-that is, by the power of the Creator? For if you suppose the meaning to be, \"If I by Beelzebub, etc., by whom your sons? \"-as if He would reproach them with having the power of Beelzebub,-you are met at once by the preceding sentence, that \"Satan cannot be divided against himself.\"[fn-63-P6392_1892086:1078-nf] So that it was not by Beelzebub that even they were casting out demons, but (as we have said) by the power of the Creator; and that He might make this understood, He adds: \"But if I with the finger of God cast out demons, is not the kingdom of God come near unto you? \"[fn-63-P6393_1892378:1079-nf] For the magicians who stood before Pharaoh and resisted Moses called the power of the Creator\"the finger of God.\"[fn-63-P6394_1892514:1080-nf] It was the finger of God, because it was a sign[fn-63-P6395_1892585:1081-nf] that even a thing of weakness was yet abundant in strength. This Christ also showed, when, recalling to notice (and not obliterating) those ancient wonders which were really His own,[fn-63-P6396_1892791:1082-nf] He said that the power of God must be understood to be the finger of none other God than Him, under[fn-63-P6397_1892928:1083-nf] whom it had received this appellation. His kingdom, therefore, was come near to them, whose power was called His \"finger.\" Well, therefore, did He connect[fn-63-P6398_1893098:1084-nf] with the parable of \"the strong man armed,\" whom \"a stronger man still overcame,\"[fn-63-P6399_1893200:1085-nf] the prince of the demons, whom He had already called Beelzebub and Satan; signifying that it was he who was overcome by the finger of God, and not that the Creator had been subdued by another god. Besides,[fn-64-P6400_1893431:1086-nf] how could His kingdom be still standing, with its boundaries, and laws, and functions, whom, even if the whole world were left entire to Him, Marcion's god could possibly seem to have overcome as \"the stronger than He,\" if it were not in consequence of His law that even Marcionites were constantly dying, by returning in their dissolution[fn-64-P6401_1893789:1087-nf] to the ground, and were so often admonished by even a scorpion, that the Creator had by no means been overcome?[fn-64-P6402_1893921:1088-nf] \"A (certain) mother of the company exclaims, `Blessed is the womb that bare Thee, and the paps which Thou hast sucked; 'but the Lord said, `Yea, rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.'\"[fn-64-P6403_1894392:1089-nf] Now He had in precisely similar terms rejected His mother or His brethren, whilst preferring those who heard and obeyed God.[fn-64-P6404_1894542:1090-nf] His mother, however, was not here present with Him. On that former occasion, therefore, He had not denied that He was her son by birth.[fn-64-P6405_1894716:1091-nf] On hearing this (salutation) the second time, He the second time transferred, as He had done before,[fn-64-P6406_1894834:1092-nf] the \"blessedness\" to His disciples from the womb and the paps of His mother, from whom, however, unless He had in her (a real mother) He could not have transferred it.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":11,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"102","folder":"ANF-03","text":"When in a certain place he had been praying to that Father above,[fn-63-P6360_1884376:1046-nf] looking up with insolent and audacious eyes to the heaven of the Creator, by whom in His rough and cruel nature he might have been crushed with hail and lightning-just as it was by Him contrived that he was (afterwards) attached to a cross[fn-63-P6361_1884637:1047-nf] at Jerusalem-one of his disciples came to him and said, \"Master, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.\" This he said, forsooth, because he thought that different prayers were required for different gods! Now, he who had advanced such a conjecture as this should first show that another god had been proclaimed by Christ. For nobody would have wanted to know how to pray, before he had learned whom he was to pray to. If, however, he had already learned this, prove it. If you find nowhere any proof, let me tell you[fn-63-P6362_1885186:1048-nf] that it was to the Creator that he asked for instruction in prayer, to whom John's disciples also used to pray. But, inasmuch as John had introduced some new order of prayer, this disciple had not improperly presumed to think that he ought also to ask of Christ whether they too must not (according to some special rule of their Master) pray, not indeed to another god, but in another manner. Christ accordingly[fn-63-P6363_1885615:1049-nf] would not have taught His disciple prayer before He had given him the knowledge of God Himself. Therefore what He actually taught was prayer to Him whom the disciple had already known. In short, you may discover in the import[fn-63-P6364_1885859:1050-nf] of the prayer what God is addressed therein. To whom can I say, \"Father? \"[fn-63-P6365_1885951:1051-nf] To him who had nothing to do with making me, from whom I do not derive my origin? Or to Him, who, by making and fashioning me, became my parent?[fn-63-P6366_1886117:1052-nf] Of whom can I ask for His Holy Spirit? Of him who gives not even the mundane spirit;[fn-63-P6367_1886222:1053-nf] or of Him \"who maketh His angels spirits,\" and whose Spirit it was which in the beginning hovered upon the waters.[fn-63-P6368_1886396:1054-nf] Whose kingdom shall I wish to come-his, of whom I never heard as the king of glory; or His, in whose hand are even the hearts of kings? Who shall give me my daily[fn-63-P6369_1886579:1055-nf] bread? Shall it be he who produces for me not a grain of millet-seed;[fn-63-P6370_1886670:1056-nf] or He who even from heaven gave to His people day by day the bread of angels?[fn-63-P6371_1886765:1057-nf] Who shall forgive me my trespasses?[fn-63-P6372_1886826:1058-nf] He who, by refusing to judge them, does not retain them; or He who, unless He forgives them, will retain them, even to His judgment?

For when they asked for bread, He gave them manna from heaven; and when they wanted flesh, He sent them abundance of quails-not a serpent for a fish, nor for an egg a scorpion.[fn-63-P6387_1890940:1073-nf] It will, however, appertain to Him not to give evil instead of good, who has both one and the other in His power. Marcion's god, on the contrary, not having a scorpion, was unable to refuse to give what he did not possess; only He (could do so), who, having a scorpion, yet gives it not. In like manner, it is He who will give the Holy Spirit, at whose command[fn-63-P6388_1891326:1074-nf] is also the unholy spirit. When He cast out the \"demon which was dumb\"[fn-63-P6389_1891417:1075-nf] (and by a cure of this sort verified Isaiah),[fn-63-P6390_1891485:1076-nf] and having been charged with casting out demons by Beelzebub, He said, \"If I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? \"[fn-63-P6391_1891654:1077-nf] By such a question what does He otherwise mean, than that He ejects the spirits by the same power by which their sons also did-that is, by the power of the Creator? For if you suppose the meaning to be, \"If I by Beelzebub, etc., by whom your sons? \"-as if He would reproach them with having the power of Beelzebub,-you are met at once by the preceding sentence, that \"Satan cannot be divided against himself.\"[fn-63-P6392_1892086:1078-nf] So that it was not by Beelzebub that even they were casting out demons, but (as we have said) by the power of the Creator; and that He might make this understood, He adds: \"But if I with the finger of God cast out demons, is not the kingdom of God come near unto you? \"[fn-63-P6393_1892378:1079-nf] For the magicians who stood before Pharaoh and resisted Moses called the power of the Creator\"the finger of God.\"[fn-63-P6394_1892514:1080-nf] It was the finger of God, because it was a sign[fn-63-P6395_1892585:1081-nf] that even a thing of weakness was yet abundant in strength. This Christ also showed, when, recalling to notice (and not obliterating) those ancient wonders which were really His own,[fn-63-P6396_1892791:1082-nf] He said that the power of God must be understood to be the finger of none other God than Him, under[fn-63-P6397_1892928:1083-nf] whom it had received this appellation. His kingdom, therefore, was come near to them, whose power was called His \"finger.\" Well, therefore, did He connect[fn-63-P6398_1893098:1084-nf] with the parable of \"the strong man armed,\" whom \"a stronger man still overcame,\"[fn-63-P6399_1893200:1085-nf] the prince of the demons, whom He had already called Beelzebub and Satan; signifying that it was he who was overcome by the finger of God, and not that the Creator had been subdued by another god. Besides,[fn-64-P6400_1893431:1086-nf] how could His kingdom be still standing, with its boundaries, and laws, and functions, whom, even if the whole world were left entire to Him, Marcion's god could possibly seem to have overcome as \"the stronger than He,\" if it were not in consequence of His law that even Marcionites were constantly dying, by returning in their dissolution[fn-64-P6401_1893789:1087-nf] to the ground, and were so often admonished by even a scorpion, that the Creator had by no means been overcome?[fn-64-P6402_1893921:1088-nf] \"A (certain) mother of the company exclaims, `Blessed is the womb that bare Thee, and the paps which Thou hast sucked; 'but the Lord said, `Yea, rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.'\"[fn-64-P6403_1894392:1089-nf] Now He had in precisely similar terms rejected His mother or His brethren, whilst preferring those who heard and obeyed God.[fn-64-P6404_1894542:1090-nf] His mother, however, was not here present with Him. On that former occasion, therefore, He had not denied that He was her son by birth.[fn-64-P6405_1894716:1091-nf] On hearing this (salutation) the second time, He the second time transferred, as He had done before,[fn-64-P6406_1894834:1092-nf] the \"blessedness\" to His disciples from the womb and the paps of His mother, from whom, however, unless He had in her (a real mother) He could not have transferred it.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":11,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"102","folder":"ANF-03","text":"When in a certain place he had been praying to that Father above,[fn-63-P6360_1884376:1046-nf] looking up with insolent and audacious eyes to the heaven of the Creator, by whom in His rough and cruel nature he might have been crushed with hail and lightning-just as it was by Him contrived that he was (afterwards) attached to a cross[fn-63-P6361_1884637:1047-nf] at Jerusalem-one of his disciples came to him and said, \"Master, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.\" This he said, forsooth, because he thought that different prayers were required for different gods! Now, he who had advanced such a conjecture as this should first show that another god had been proclaimed by Christ. For nobody would have wanted to know how to pray, before he had learned whom he was to pray to. If, however, he had already learned this, prove it. If you find nowhere any proof, let me tell you[fn-63-P6362_1885186:1048-nf] that it was to the Creator that he asked for instruction in prayer, to whom John's disciples also used to pray. But, inasmuch as John had introduced some new order of prayer, this disciple had not improperly presumed to think that he ought also to ask of Christ whether they too must not (according to some special rule of their Master) pray, not indeed to another god, but in another manner. Christ accordingly[fn-63-P6363_1885615:1049-nf] would not have taught His disciple prayer before He had given him the knowledge of God Himself. Therefore what He actually taught was prayer to Him whom the disciple had already known. In short, you may discover in the import[fn-63-P6364_1885859:1050-nf] of the prayer what God is addressed therein. To whom can I say, \"Father? \"[fn-63-P6365_1885951:1051-nf] To him who had nothing to do with making me, from whom I do not derive my origin? Or to Him, who, by making and fashioning me, became my parent?[fn-63-P6366_1886117:1052-nf] Of whom can I ask for His Holy Spirit? Of him who gives not even the mundane spirit;[fn-63-P6367_1886222:1053-nf] or of Him \"who maketh His angels spirits,\" and whose Spirit it was which in the beginning hovered upon the waters.[fn-63-P6368_1886396:1054-nf] Whose kingdom shall I wish to come-his, of whom I never heard as the king of glory; or His, in whose hand are even the hearts of kings? Who shall give me my daily[fn-63-P6369_1886579:1055-nf] bread? Shall it be he who produces for me not a grain of millet-seed;[fn-63-P6370_1886670:1056-nf] or He who even from heaven gave to His people day by day the bread of angels?[fn-63-P6371_1886765:1057-nf] Who shall forgive me my trespasses?[fn-63-P6372_1886826:1058-nf] He who, by refusing to judge them, does not retain them; or He who, unless He forgives them, will retain them, even to His judgment? Who shall suffer us not to be led into temptation? He before whom the tempter will never be able to tremble; or He who from the beginning has beforehand condemned[fn-63-P6373_1887143:1059-nf] the angel tempter? If any one, with such a form,[fn-63-P6374_1887215:1060-nf] invokes another god and not the Creator, he does not pray; he only blasphemes.[fn-63-P6375_1887315:1061-nf] In like manner, from whom must I ask that I may receive? Of whom seek, that I may find? To whom knock, that it may be opened to me?[fn-63-P6376_1887465:1062-nf] Who has to give to him that asks, but He to whom all things belong, and whose am I also that am the asker? What, however, have I lost before that other god, that I should seek of him and find it. If it be wisdom and prudence, it is the Creator who has hidden them. Shall I resort to him, then, in quest of them? If it be health[fn-63-P6377_1887814:1063-nf] and life, they are at the disposal of the Creator. Nor must anything be sought and found anywhere else than there, where it is kept in secret that it may come to light. So, again, at no other door will I knock than at that out of which my privilege has reached me.[fn-63-P6378_1888117:1064-nf] In fine, if to receive, and to find, and to be admitted, is the fruit of labour and earnestness to him who has asked, and sought, and knocked, understand that these duties have been enjoined, and results promised, by the Creator. As for that most excellent god of yours, coming as he professes gratuitously to help man, who was not his (creature),[fn-63-P6379_1888594:1065-nf] he could not have imposed upon him any labour, or (endowed him with) any earnestness. For he would by this time cease to be the most excellent god, were he not spontaneously to give to every one who does not ask, and permit every one who seeks not to find, and open to every one who does not knock. The Creator, on the contrary,[fn-63-P6380_1888963:1066-nf] was able to proclaim these duties and rewards by Christ, in order that man, who by sinning had offended his God, might toil on (in his probation), and by his perseverance in asking might receive, and in seeking might find, and in knocking might enter. Accordingly, the preceding similitude[fn-63-P6381_1889269:1067-nf] represents the man who went at night and begged for the loaves, in the light of a friend and not a stranger, and makes him knock at a friend's house and not at a stranger's. But even if he has offended, man is more of a friend with the Creator than with the god of Marcion. At His door, therefore, does he knock to whom he had the right of access; whose gate he had found; whom he knew to possess bread; in bed now with His children, whom He had willed to be born.[fn-63-P6382_1889761:1068-nf] Even though the knocking is late in the day, it is yet the Creator's time. To Him belongs the latest hour who owns an entire age[fn-63-P6383_1890055:1069-nf] and the end thereof. As for the new god, however, no one could have knocked at his door late, for he has hardly yet[fn-63-P6384_1890190:1070-nf] seen the light of morning. It is the Creator, who once shut the door to the Gentiles, which was then knocked at by the Jews, that both rises and gives, if not now to man as a friend, yet not as a stranger, but, as He says, \"because of his importunity.\"[fn-63-P6385_1890484:1071-nf] Importunate, however, the recent god could not have permitted any one to be in the short time (since his appearance).[fn-63-P6386_1890623:1072-nf] Him, therefore, whom you call the Creator recognise also as \"Father.\" It is even He who knows what His children require.

When He cast out the \"demon which was dumb\"[fn-63-P6389_1891417:1075-nf] (and by a cure of this sort verified Isaiah),[fn-63-P6390_1891485:1076-nf] and having been charged with casting out demons by Beelzebub, He said, \"If I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? \"[fn-63-P6391_1891654:1077-nf] By such a question what does He otherwise mean, than that He ejects the spirits by the same power by which their sons also did-that is, by the power of the Creator?

Besides,[fn-64-P6400_1893431:1086-nf] how could His kingdom be still standing, with its boundaries, and laws, and functions, whom, even if the whole world were left entire to Him, Marcion's god could possibly seem to have overcome as \"the stronger than He,\" if it were not in consequence of His law that even Marcionites were constantly dying, by returning in their dissolution[fn-64-P6401_1893789:1087-nf] to the ground, and were so often admonished by even a scorpion, that the Creator had by no means been overcome?[fn-64-P6402_1893921:1088-nf] \"A (certain) mother of the company exclaims, `Blessed is the womb that bare Thee, and the paps which Thou hast sucked; 'but the Lord said, `Yea, rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.'\"[fn-64-P6403_1894392:1089-nf] Now He had in precisely similar terms rejected His mother or His brethren, whilst preferring those who heard and obeyed God.[fn-64-P6404_1894542:1090-nf] His mother, however, was not here present with Him. On that former occasion, therefore, He had not denied that He was her son by birth.[fn-64-P6405_1894716:1091-nf] On hearing this (salutation) the second time, He the second time transferred, as He had done before,[fn-64-P6406_1894834:1092-nf] the \"blessedness\" to His disciples from the womb and the paps of His mother, from whom, however, unless He had in her (a real mother) He could not have transferred it.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":11,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"102","folder":"ANF-03","text":"When in a certain place he had been praying to that Father above,[fn-63-P6360_1884376:1046-nf] looking up with insolent and audacious eyes to the heaven of the Creator, by whom in His rough and cruel nature he might have been crushed with hail and lightning-just as it was by Him contrived that he was (afterwards) attached to a cross[fn-63-P6361_1884637:1047-nf] at Jerusalem-one of his disciples came to him and said, \"Master, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.\" This he said, forsooth, because he thought that different prayers were required for different gods! Now, he who had advanced such a conjecture as this should first show that another god had been proclaimed by Christ. For nobody would have wanted to know how to pray, before he had learned whom he was to pray to. If, however, he had already learned this, prove it. If you find nowhere any proof, let me tell you[fn-63-P6362_1885186:1048-nf] that it was to the Creator that he asked for instruction in prayer, to whom John's disciples also used to pray. But, inasmuch as John had introduced some new order of prayer, this disciple had not improperly presumed to think that he ought also to ask of Christ whether they too must not (according to some special rule of their Master) pray, not indeed to another god, but in another manner. Christ accordingly[fn-63-P6363_1885615:1049-nf] would not have taught His disciple prayer before He had given him the knowledge of God Himself. Therefore what He actually taught was prayer to Him whom the disciple had already known. In short, you may discover in the import[fn-63-P6364_1885859:1050-nf] of the prayer what God is addressed therein. To whom can I say, \"Father? \"[fn-63-P6365_1885951:1051-nf] To him who had nothing to do with making me, from whom I do not derive my origin? Or to Him, who, by making and fashioning me, became my parent?[fn-63-P6366_1886117:1052-nf] Of whom can I ask for His Holy Spirit? Of him who gives not even the mundane spirit;[fn-63-P6367_1886222:1053-nf] or of Him \"who maketh His angels spirits,\" and whose Spirit it was which in the beginning hovered upon the waters.[fn-63-P6368_1886396:1054-nf] Whose kingdom shall I wish to come-his, of whom I never heard as the king of glory; or His, in whose hand are even the hearts of kings? Who shall give me my daily[fn-63-P6369_1886579:1055-nf] bread? Shall it be he who produces for me not a grain of millet-seed;[fn-63-P6370_1886670:1056-nf] or He who even from heaven gave to His people day by day the bread of angels?[fn-63-P6371_1886765:1057-nf] Who shall forgive me my trespasses?[fn-63-P6372_1886826:1058-nf] He who, by refusing to judge them, does not retain them; or He who, unless He forgives them, will retain them, even to His judgment? Who shall suffer us not to be led into temptation? He before whom the tempter will never be able to tremble; or He who from the beginning has beforehand condemned[fn-63-P6373_1887143:1059-nf] the angel tempter? If any one, with such a form,[fn-63-P6374_1887215:1060-nf] invokes another god and not the Creator, he does not pray; he only blasphemes.[fn-63-P6375_1887315:1061-nf] In like manner, from whom must I ask that I may receive? Of whom seek, that I may find? To whom knock, that it may be opened to me?[fn-63-P6376_1887465:1062-nf] Who has to give to him that asks, but He to whom all things belong, and whose am I also that am the asker? What, however, have I lost before that other god, that I should seek of him and find it. If it be wisdom and prudence, it is the Creator who has hidden them. Shall I resort to him, then, in quest of them? If it be health[fn-63-P6377_1887814:1063-nf] and life, they are at the disposal of the Creator. Nor must anything be sought and found anywhere else than there, where it is kept in secret that it may come to light. So, again, at no other door will I knock than at that out of which my privilege has reached me.[fn-63-P6378_1888117:1064-nf] In fine, if to receive, and to find, and to be admitted, is the fruit of labour and earnestness to him who has asked, and sought, and knocked, understand that these duties have been enjoined, and results promised, by the Creator. As for that most excellent god of yours, coming as he professes gratuitously to help man, who was not his (creature),[fn-63-P6379_1888594:1065-nf] he could not have imposed upon him any labour, or (endowed him with) any earnestness. For he would by this time cease to be the most excellent god, were he not spontaneously to give to every one who does not ask, and permit every one who seeks not to find, and open to every one who does not knock. The Creator, on the contrary,[fn-63-P6380_1888963:1066-nf] was able to proclaim these duties and rewards by Christ, in order that man, who by sinning had offended his God, might toil on (in his probation), and by his perseverance in asking might receive, and in seeking might find, and in knocking might enter. Accordingly, the preceding similitude[fn-63-P6381_1889269:1067-nf] represents the man who went at night and begged for the loaves, in the light of a friend and not a stranger, and makes him knock at a friend's house and not at a stranger's. But even if he has offended, man is more of a friend with the Creator than with the god of Marcion. At His door, therefore, does he knock to whom he had the right of access; whose gate he had found; whom he knew to possess bread; in bed now with His children, whom He had willed to be born.[fn-63-P6382_1889761:1068-nf] Even though the knocking is late in the day, it is yet the Creator's time. To Him belongs the latest hour who owns an entire age[fn-63-P6383_1890055:1069-nf] and the end thereof. As for the new god, however, no one could have knocked at his door late, for he has hardly yet[fn-63-P6384_1890190:1070-nf] seen the light of morning. It is the Creator, who once shut the door to the Gentiles, which was then knocked at by the Jews, that both rises and gives, if not now to man as a friend, yet not as a stranger, but, as He says, \"because of his importunity.\"[fn-63-P6385_1890484:1071-nf] Importunate, however, the recent god could not have permitted any one to be in the short time (since his appearance).[fn-63-P6386_1890623:1072-nf] Him, therefore, whom you call the Creator recognise also as \"Father.\" It is even He who knows what His children require. For when they asked for bread, He gave them manna from heaven; and when they wanted flesh, He sent them abundance of quails-not a serpent for a fish, nor for an egg a scorpion.[fn-63-P6387_1890940:1073-nf] It will, however, appertain to Him not to give evil instead of good, who has both one and the other in His power. Marcion's god, on the contrary, not having a scorpion, was unable to refuse to give what he did not possess; only He (could do so), who, having a scorpion, yet gives it not. In like manner, it is He who will give the Holy Spirit, at whose command[fn-63-P6388_1891326:1074-nf] is also the unholy spirit. When He cast out the \"demon which was dumb\"[fn-63-P6389_1891417:1075-nf] (and by a cure of this sort verified Isaiah),[fn-63-P6390_1891485:1076-nf] and having been charged with casting out demons by Beelzebub, He said, \"If I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? \"[fn-63-P6391_1891654:1077-nf] By such a question what does He otherwise mean, than that He ejects the spirits by the same power by which their sons also did-that is, by the power of the Creator? For if you suppose the meaning to be, \"If I by Beelzebub, etc., by whom your sons? \"-as if He would reproach them with having the power of Beelzebub,-you are met at once by the preceding sentence, that \"Satan cannot be divided against himself.\"[fn-63-P6392_1892086:1078-nf] So that it was not by Beelzebub that even they were casting out demons, but (as we have said) by the power of the Creator; and that He might make this understood, He adds: \"But if I with the finger of God cast out demons, is not the kingdom of God come near unto you? \"[fn-63-P6393_1892378:1079-nf] For the magicians who stood before Pharaoh and resisted Moses called the power of the Creator\"the finger of God.\"[fn-63-P6394_1892514:1080-nf] It was the finger of God, because it was a sign[fn-63-P6395_1892585:1081-nf] that even a thing of weakness was yet abundant in strength. This Christ also showed, when, recalling to notice (and not obliterating) those ancient wonders which were really His own,[fn-63-P6396_1892791:1082-nf] He said that the power of God must be understood to be the finger of none other God than Him, under[fn-63-P6397_1892928:1083-nf] whom it had received this appellation.

Therefore what He actually taught was prayer to Him whom the disciple had already known. In short, you may discover in the import[fn-63-P6364_1885859:1050-nf] of the prayer what God is addressed therein. To whom can I say, \"Father? \"[fn-63-P6365_1885951:1051-nf] To him who had nothing to do with making me, from whom I do not derive my origin? Or to Him, who, by making and fashioning me, became my parent?[fn-63-P6366_1886117:1052-nf] Of whom can I ask for His Holy Spirit? Of him who gives not even the mundane spirit;[fn-63-P6367_1886222:1053-nf] or of Him \"who maketh His angels spirits,\" and whose Spirit it was which in the beginning hovered upon the waters.[fn-63-P6368_1886396:1054-nf] Whose kingdom shall I wish to come-his, of whom I never heard as the king of glory; or His, in whose hand are even the hearts of kings? Who shall give me my daily[fn-63-P6369_1886579:1055-nf] bread? Shall it be he who produces for me not a grain of millet-seed;[fn-63-P6370_1886670:1056-nf] or He who even from heaven gave to His people day by day the bread of angels?[fn-63-P6371_1886765:1057-nf] Who shall forgive me my trespasses?[fn-63-P6372_1886826:1058-nf] He who, by refusing to judge them, does not retain them; or He who, unless He forgives them, will retain them, even to His judgment? Who shall suffer us not to be led into temptation? He before whom the tempter will never be able to tremble; or He who from the beginning has beforehand condemned[fn-63-P6373_1887143:1059-nf] the angel tempter? If any one, with such a form,[fn-63-P6374_1887215:1060-nf] invokes another god and not the Creator, he does not pray; he only blasphemes.[fn-63-P6375_1887315:1061-nf] In like manner, from whom must I ask that I may receive? Of whom seek, that I may find? To whom knock, that it may be opened to me?[fn-63-P6376_1887465:1062-nf] Who has to give to him that asks, but He to whom all things belong, and whose am I also that am the asker? What, however, have I lost before that other god, that I should seek of him and find it. If it be wisdom and prudence, it is the Creator who has hidden them. Shall I resort to him, then, in quest of them? If it be health[fn-63-P6377_1887814:1063-nf] and life, they are at the disposal of the Creator. Nor must anything be sought and found anywhere else than there, where it is kept in secret that it may come to light. So, again, at no other door will I knock than at that out of which my privilege has reached me.[fn-63-P6378_1888117:1064-nf] In fine, if to receive, and to find, and to be admitted, is the fruit of labour and earnestness to him who has asked, and sought, and knocked, understand that these duties have been enjoined, and results promised, by the Creator. As for that most excellent god of yours, coming as he professes gratuitously to help man, who was not his (creature),[fn-63-P6379_1888594:1065-nf] he could not have imposed upon him any labour, or (endowed him with) any earnestness. For he would by this time cease to be the most excellent god, were he not spontaneously to give to every one who does not ask, and permit every one who seeks not to find, and open to every one who does not knock. The Creator, on the contrary,[fn-63-P6380_1888963:1066-nf] was able to proclaim these duties and rewards by Christ, in order that man, who by sinning had offended his God, might toil on (in his probation), and by his perseverance in asking might receive, and in seeking might find, and in knocking might enter. Accordingly, the preceding similitude[fn-63-P6381_1889269:1067-nf] represents the man who went at night and begged for the loaves, in the light of a friend and not a stranger, and makes him knock at a friend's house and not at a stranger's. But even if he has offended, man is more of a friend with the Creator than with the god of Marcion. At His door, therefore, does he knock to whom he had the right of access; whose gate he had found; whom he knew to possess bread; in bed now with His children, whom He had willed to be born.[fn-63-P6382_1889761:1068-nf] Even though the knocking is late in the day, it is yet the Creator's time. To Him belongs the latest hour who owns an entire age[fn-63-P6383_1890055:1069-nf] and the end thereof. As for the new god, however, no one could have knocked at his door late, for he has hardly yet[fn-63-P6384_1890190:1070-nf] seen the light of morning. It is the Creator, who once shut the door to the Gentiles, which was then knocked at by the Jews, that both rises and gives, if not now to man as a friend, yet not as a stranger, but, as He says, \"because of his importunity.\"[fn-63-P6385_1890484:1071-nf] Importunate, however, the recent god could not have permitted any one to be in the short time (since his appearance).[fn-63-P6386_1890623:1072-nf] Him, therefore, whom you call the Creator recognise also as \"Father.\" It is even He who knows what His children require. For when they asked for bread, He gave them manna from heaven; and when they wanted flesh, He sent them abundance of quails-not a serpent for a fish, nor for an egg a scorpion.[fn-63-P6387_1890940:1073-nf] It will, however, appertain to Him not to give evil instead of good, who has both one and the other in His power. Marcion's god, on the contrary, not having a scorpion, was unable to refuse to give what he did not possess; only He (could do so), who, having a scorpion, yet gives it not. In like manner, it is He who will give the Holy Spirit, at whose command[fn-63-P6388_1891326:1074-nf] is also the unholy spirit. When He cast out the \"demon which was dumb\"[fn-63-P6389_1891417:1075-nf] (and by a cure of this sort verified Isaiah),[fn-63-P6390_1891485:1076-nf] and having been charged with casting out demons by Beelzebub, He said, \"If I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? \"[fn-63-P6391_1891654:1077-nf] By such a question what does He otherwise mean, than that He ejects the spirits by the same power by which their sons also did-that is, by the power of the Creator? For if you suppose the meaning to be, \"If I by Beelzebub, etc., by whom your sons? \"-as if He would reproach them with having the power of Beelzebub,-you are met at once by the preceding sentence, that \"Satan cannot be divided against himself.\"[fn-63-P6392_1892086:1078-nf] So that it was not by Beelzebub that even they were casting out demons, but (as we have said) by the power of the Creator; and that He might make this understood, He adds: \"But if I with the finger of God cast out demons, is not the kingdom of God come near unto you? \"[fn-63-P6393_1892378:1079-nf] For the magicians who stood before Pharaoh and resisted Moses called the power of the Creator\"the finger of God.\"[fn-63-P6394_1892514:1080-nf] It was the finger of God, because it was a sign[fn-63-P6395_1892585:1081-nf] that even a thing of weakness was yet abundant in strength. This Christ also showed, when, recalling to notice (and not obliterating) those ancient wonders which were really His own,[fn-63-P6396_1892791:1082-nf] He said that the power of God must be understood to be the finger of none other God than Him, under[fn-63-P6397_1892928:1083-nf] whom it had received this appellation. His kingdom, therefore, was come near to them, whose power was called His \"finger.\" Well, therefore, did He connect[fn-63-P6398_1893098:1084-nf] with the parable of \"the strong man armed,\" whom \"a stronger man still overcame,\"[fn-63-P6399_1893200:1085-nf] the prince of the demons, whom He had already called Beelzebub and Satan; signifying that it was he who was overcome by the finger of God, and not that the Creator had been subdued by another god. Besides,[fn-64-P6400_1893431:1086-nf] how could His kingdom be still standing, with its boundaries, and laws, and functions, whom, even if the whole world were left entire to Him, Marcion's god could possibly seem to have overcome as \"the stronger than He,\" if it were not in consequence of His law that even Marcionites were constantly dying, by returning in their dissolution[fn-64-P6401_1893789:1087-nf] to the ground, and were so often admonished by even a scorpion, that the Creator had by no means been overcome?[fn-64-P6402_1893921:1088-nf] \"A (certain) mother of the company exclaims, `Blessed is the womb that bare Thee, and the paps which Thou hast sucked; 'but the Lord said, `Yea, rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.'\"[fn-64-P6403_1894392:1089-nf] Now He had in precisely similar terms rejected His mother or His brethren, whilst preferring those who heard and obeyed God.[fn-64-P6404_1894542:1090-nf] His mother, however, was not here present with Him. On that former occasion, therefore, He had not denied that He was her son by birth.[fn-64-P6405_1894716:1091-nf] On hearing this (salutation) the second time, He the second time transferred, as He had done before,[fn-64-P6406_1894834:1092-nf] the \"blessedness\" to His disciples from the womb and the paps of His mother, from whom, however, unless He had in her (a real mother) He could not have transferred it.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":11,"verse":20,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"102","folder":"ANF-03","text":"When in a certain place he had been praying to that Father above,[fn-63-P6360_1884376:1046-nf] looking up with insolent and audacious eyes to the heaven of the Creator, by whom in His rough and cruel nature he might have been crushed with hail and lightning-just as it was by Him contrived that he was (afterwards) attached to a cross[fn-63-P6361_1884637:1047-nf] at Jerusalem-one of his disciples came to him and said, \"Master, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.\" This he said, forsooth, because he thought that different prayers were required for different gods! Now, he who had advanced such a conjecture as this should first show that another god had been proclaimed by Christ. For nobody would have wanted to know how to pray, before he had learned whom he was to pray to. If, however, he had already learned this, prove it. If you find nowhere any proof, let me tell you[fn-63-P6362_1885186:1048-nf] that it was to the Creator that he asked for instruction in prayer, to whom John's disciples also used to pray.

For he would by this time cease to be the most excellent god, were he not spontaneously to give to every one who does not ask, and permit every one who seeks not to find, and open to every one who does not knock. The Creator, on the contrary,[fn-63-P6380_1888963:1066-nf] was able to proclaim these duties and rewards by Christ, in order that man, who by sinning had offended his God, might toil on (in his probation), and by his perseverance in asking might receive, and in seeking might find, and in knocking might enter. Accordingly, the preceding similitude[fn-63-P6381_1889269:1067-nf] represents the man who went at night and begged for the loaves, in the light of a friend and not a stranger, and makes him knock at a friend's house and not at a stranger's. But even if he has offended, man is more of a friend with the Creator than with the god of Marcion. At His door, therefore, does he knock to whom he had the right of access; whose gate he had found; whom he knew to possess bread; in bed now with His children, whom He had willed to be born.[fn-63-P6382_1889761:1068-nf] Even though the knocking is late in the day, it is yet the Creator's time. To Him belongs the latest hour who owns an entire age[fn-63-P6383_1890055:1069-nf] and the end thereof. As for the new god, however, no one could have knocked at his door late, for he has hardly yet[fn-63-P6384_1890190:1070-nf] seen the light of morning. It is the Creator, who once shut the door to the Gentiles, which was then knocked at by the Jews, that both rises and gives, if not now to man as a friend, yet not as a stranger, but, as He says, \"because of his importunity.\"[fn-63-P6385_1890484:1071-nf] Importunate, however, the recent god could not have permitted any one to be in the short time (since his appearance).[fn-63-P6386_1890623:1072-nf] Him, therefore, whom you call the Creator recognise also as \"Father.\" It is even He who knows what His children require. For when they asked for bread, He gave them manna from heaven; and when they wanted flesh, He sent them abundance of quails-not a serpent for a fish, nor for an egg a scorpion.[fn-63-P6387_1890940:1073-nf] It will, however, appertain to Him not to give evil instead of good, who has both one and the other in His power. Marcion's god, on the contrary, not having a scorpion, was unable to refuse to give what he did not possess; only He (could do so), who, having a scorpion, yet gives it not. In like manner, it is He who will give the Holy Spirit, at whose command[fn-63-P6388_1891326:1074-nf] is also the unholy spirit. When He cast out the \"demon which was dumb\"[fn-63-P6389_1891417:1075-nf] (and by a cure of this sort verified Isaiah),[fn-63-P6390_1891485:1076-nf] and having been charged with casting out demons by Beelzebub, He said, \"If I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? \"[fn-63-P6391_1891654:1077-nf] By such a question what does He otherwise mean, than that He ejects the spirits by the same power by which their sons also did-that is, by the power of the Creator? For if you suppose the meaning to be, \"If I by Beelzebub, etc., by whom your sons? \"-as if He would reproach them with having the power of Beelzebub,-you are met at once by the preceding sentence, that \"Satan cannot be divided against himself.\"[fn-63-P6392_1892086:1078-nf] So that it was not by Beelzebub that even they were casting out demons, but (as we have said) by the power of the Creator; and that He might make this understood, He adds: \"But if I with the finger of God cast out demons, is not the kingdom of God come near unto you? \"[fn-63-P6393_1892378:1079-nf] For the magicians who stood before Pharaoh and resisted Moses called the power of the Creator\"the finger of God.\"[fn-63-P6394_1892514:1080-nf] It was the finger of God, because it was a sign[fn-63-P6395_1892585:1081-nf] that even a thing of weakness was yet abundant in strength. This Christ also showed, when, recalling to notice (and not obliterating) those ancient wonders which were really His own,[fn-63-P6396_1892791:1082-nf] He said that the power of God must be understood to be the finger of none other God than Him, under[fn-63-P6397_1892928:1083-nf] whom it had received this appellation. His kingdom, therefore, was come near to them, whose power was called His \"finger.\" Well, therefore, did He connect[fn-63-P6398_1893098:1084-nf] with the parable of \"the strong man armed,\" whom \"a stronger man still overcame,\"[fn-63-P6399_1893200:1085-nf] the prince of the demons, whom He had already called Beelzebub and Satan; signifying that it was he who was overcome by the finger of God, and not that the Creator had been subdued by another god. Besides,[fn-64-P6400_1893431:1086-nf] how could His kingdom be still standing, with its boundaries, and laws, and functions, whom, even if the whole world were left entire to Him, Marcion's god could possibly seem to have overcome as \"the stronger than He,\" if it were not in consequence of His law that even Marcionites were constantly dying, by returning in their dissolution[fn-64-P6401_1893789:1087-nf] to the ground, and were so often admonished by even a scorpion, that the Creator had by no means been overcome?[fn-64-P6402_1893921:1088-nf] \"A (certain) mother of the company exclaims, `Blessed is the womb that bare Thee, and the paps which Thou hast sucked; 'but the Lord said, `Yea, rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.'\"[fn-64-P6403_1894392:1089-nf] Now He had in precisely similar terms rejected His mother or His brethren, whilst preferring those who heard and obeyed God.[fn-64-P6404_1894542:1090-nf] His mother, however, was not here present with Him. On that former occasion, therefore, He had not denied that He was her son by birth.[fn-64-P6405_1894716:1091-nf] On hearing this (salutation) the second time, He the second time transferred, as He had done before,[fn-64-P6406_1894834:1092-nf] the \"blessedness\" to His disciples from the womb and the paps of His mother, from whom, however, unless He had in her (a real mother) He could not have transferred it.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":11,"verse":27,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"102","folder":"ANF-03","text":"When in a certain place he had been praying to that Father above,[fn-63-P6360_1884376:1046-nf] looking up with insolent and audacious eyes to the heaven of the Creator, by whom in His rough and cruel nature he might have been crushed with hail and lightning-just as it was by Him contrived that he was (afterwards) attached to a cross[fn-63-P6361_1884637:1047-nf] at Jerusalem-one of his disciples came to him and said, \"Master, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.\" This he said, forsooth, because he thought that different prayers were required for different gods! Now, he who had advanced such a conjecture as this should first show that another god had been proclaimed by Christ. For nobody would have wanted to know how to pray, before he had learned whom he was to pray to. If, however, he had already learned this, prove it. If you find nowhere any proof, let me tell you[fn-63-P6362_1885186:1048-nf] that it was to the Creator that he asked for instruction in prayer, to whom John's disciples also used to pray. But, inasmuch as John had introduced some new order of prayer, this disciple had not improperly presumed to think that he ought also to ask of Christ whether they too must not (according to some special rule of their Master) pray, not indeed to another god, but in another manner. Christ accordingly[fn-63-P6363_1885615:1049-nf] would not have taught His disciple prayer before He had given him the knowledge of God Himself. Therefore what He actually taught was prayer to Him whom the disciple had already known. In short, you may discover in the import[fn-63-P6364_1885859:1050-nf] of the prayer what God is addressed therein. To whom can I say, \"Father? \"[fn-63-P6365_1885951:1051-nf] To him who had nothing to do with making me, from whom I do not derive my origin? Or to Him, who, by making and fashioning me, became my parent?[fn-63-P6366_1886117:1052-nf] Of whom can I ask for His Holy Spirit? Of him who gives not even the mundane spirit;[fn-63-P6367_1886222:1053-nf] or of Him \"who maketh His angels spirits,\" and whose Spirit it was which in the beginning hovered upon the waters.[fn-63-P6368_1886396:1054-nf] Whose kingdom shall I wish to come-his, of whom I never heard as the king of glory; or His, in whose hand are even the hearts of kings? Who shall give me my daily[fn-63-P6369_1886579:1055-nf] bread? Shall it be he who produces for me not a grain of millet-seed;[fn-63-P6370_1886670:1056-nf] or He who even from heaven gave to His people day by day the bread of angels?[fn-63-P6371_1886765:1057-nf] Who shall forgive me my trespasses?[fn-63-P6372_1886826:1058-nf] He who, by refusing to judge them, does not retain them; or He who, unless He forgives them, will retain them, even to His judgment? Who shall suffer us not to be led into temptation? He before whom the tempter will never be able to tremble; or He who from the beginning has beforehand condemned[fn-63-P6373_1887143:1059-nf] the angel tempter? If any one, with such a form,[fn-63-P6374_1887215:1060-nf] invokes another god and not the Creator, he does not pray; he only blasphemes.[fn-63-P6375_1887315:1061-nf] In like manner, from whom must I ask that I may receive? Of whom seek, that I may find? To whom knock, that it may be opened to me?[fn-63-P6376_1887465:1062-nf] Who has to give to him that asks, but He to whom all things belong, and whose am I also that am the asker? What, however, have I lost before that other god, that I should seek of him and find it. If it be wisdom and prudence, it is the Creator who has hidden them. Shall I resort to him, then, in quest of them? If it be health[fn-63-P6377_1887814:1063-nf] and life, they are at the disposal of the Creator. Nor must anything be sought and found anywhere else than there, where it is kept in secret that it may come to light. So, again, at no other door will I knock than at that out of which my privilege has reached me.[fn-63-P6378_1888117:1064-nf] In fine, if to receive, and to find, and to be admitted, is the fruit of labour and earnestness to him who has asked, and sought, and knocked, understand that these duties have been enjoined, and results promised, by the Creator.

Teaching one thing and doing another, he enjoins \"giving to every one that seeks; \"and yet he himself refuses to give to those \"who seek a sign.\"[fn-64-P6412_1895657:1095-nf] For a vast age he hides his own light from men, and yet says that a candle must not be hidden, but affirms that it ought to be set upon a candlestick, that it may give light to all.[fn-64-P6413_1895861:1096-nf] He forbids cursing again, and cursing much more of course; and yet he heaps his woe upon the Pharisees and doctors of the law.[fn-64-P6414_1896010:1097-nf] Who so closely resembles my God as: His own Christ? We have often already laid it down for certain,[fn-64-P6415_1896148:1098-nf] that He could not have been branded[fn-64-P6416_1896202:1099-nf] as the destroyer of the law if He had promulged another god. Therefore even the Pharisee, who invited Him to dinner in the passage before us,[fn-64-P6417_1896363:1100-nf] expressed some surprise[fn-64-P6418_1896402:1101-nf] in His presence that He had not washed before He sat down to meat, in accordance with the law, since it was the God of the law that He was proclaiming.[fn-64-P6419_1896576:1102-nf] Jesus also interpreted the law to him when He told him that they \"made clean the outside of the cup and the platter, whereas their inward part was full of ravening and wickedness.\" This He said, to signify that by the cleansing of vessels was to be understood before God the purification of men, inasmuch as it was about a man, and not about an unwashed vessel, that even this Pharisee had been treating in His presence. He therefore said: \"You wash the outside of the cup,\" that is, the flesh, \"but you do not cleanse your inside part,\"[fn-64-P6420_1897137:1103-nf] that is, the soul; adding: \"Did not He that made the outside,\" that is, the flesh, \"also make the inward part,\" that is to say, the soul?-by which assertion He expressly declared that to the same God belongs the cleansing of a man's external and internal nature, both alike being in the power of Him who prefers mercy not only to man's washing,[fn-64-P6421_1897504:1104-nf] but even to sacrifice.[fn-64-P6422_1897545:1105-nf] For He subjoins the command: \"Give what ye possess as alms, and all things shall be clean unto you.\"[fn-64-P6423_1897697:1106-nf] Even if another god could have enjoined mercy, he could not have done so previous to his becoming known. Furthermore, it is in this passage evident that they[fn-64-P6424_1897877:1107-nf] were not reproved concerning their God, but concerning a point of His instruction to them, when He prescribed to them figuratively the cleansing of their vessels, but really the works of merciful dispositions. In like manner, He upbraids them for tithing paltry herbs,[fn-64-P6425_1898182:1108-nf] but at the same time \"passing over hospitality[fn-64-P6426_1898249:1109-nf] and the love of God.[fn-64-P6427_1898502:1110-nf] The vocation and the love of what God, but Him by whose law of tithes they used to offer their rue and mint? For the whole point of the rebuke lay in this, that they cared about small matters in His service of course, to whom they failed to exhibit their weightier duties when He commanded them: \"Thou shalt love with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, the Lord thy God, who hath called thee out of Egypt.\"[fn-64-P6428_1898963:1111-nf] Besides, time enough had not yet passed to admit of Christ's requiring so premature-nay, as yet so distasteful[fn-64-P6429_1899096:1112-nf] -a love towards a new and recent, not to say a hardly i yet developed,[fn-64-P6430_1899184:1113-nf] deity. When, again, He upbraids those who caught at the uppermost places and the honour of public salutations, He only follows out the Creator's course,[fn-64-P6431_1899366:1114-nf] who calls ambitious persons of this character \"rulers of Sodom\"[fn-64-P6432_1899459:1115-nf] who forbids us \"to put confidence even in princes,\"[fn-64-P6433_1899532:1116-nf] and pronounces him to be altogether wretched who places his confidence in man. But whoever[fn-64-P6434_1899647:1117-nf] aims at high position, because he would glory in the officious attentions[fn-64-P6435_1899742:1118-nf] of other people, (in every such case, ) inasmuch as He forbade such attentions (in the shape) of placing hope and confidence in man, He at the same time[fn-64-P6436_1899914:1119-nf] censured all who were ambitious of high positions. He also inveighs against the doctors of the law themselves, because they were \"lading men with burdens grievous to be borne, which they did not venture to touch with even a finger of their own; \"[fn-64-P6437_1900176:1120-nf] but not as if He made a mock of[fn-64-P6438_1900230:1121-nf] the burdens of the law with any feeling of detestation towards it. For how could He have felt aversion to the law, who used with so much earnestness to upbraid them for passing over its weightier matters, alms-giving, hospitality,[fn-64-P6439_1900483:1122-nf] and the love of God? Nor, indeed, was it only these great things (which He recognized), but even[fn-64-P6440_1900620:1123-nf] the tithes of rue and the cleansing of cups. But, in truth, He would rather have deemed them excusable for being unable to carry burdens which could not be borne. What, then, are the burdens which He censures?[fn-64-P6441_1900847:1124-nf] None but those which they were accumulating of their own accord, when they taught for commandments the doctrines of men; for the sake of private advantage joining house to house, so as to deprive their neighbour of his own; cajoling[fn-64-P6442_1901096:1125-nf] the people, loving gifts, pursuing rewards, robbing the poor of the rights of judgment, that they might have the widow for a prey and the fatherless for a spoil.[fn-64-P6443_1901278:1126-nf] Of these Isaiah also says, \"Woe unto them that are strong in Jerusalem!\"[fn-64-P6444_1901389:1127-nf] and again, \"They that demand you shall rule over you.\"[fn-64-P6445_1901470:1128-nf] And who did this more than the lawyers?[fn-64-P6446_1901646:1129-nf] Now, if these offended Christ, it was as belonging to Him that they offended Him. He would have aimed no blow at the teachers of an alien law. But why is a \"woe\" pronounced against them for \"building the sepulchres of the prophets whom their fathers had killed? \"[fn-64-P6447_1901964:1130-nf] They rather deserved praise, because by such an act of piety they seemed to show that they did not allow the deeds of their fathers. Was it not because (Christ) was jealous[fn-64-P6448_1902159:1131-nf] of such a disposition as the Marcionites denounce, visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the fourth generation?

He also inveighs against the doctors of the law themselves, because they were \"lading men with burdens grievous to be borne, which they did not venture to touch with even a finger of their own; \"[fn-64-P6437_1900176:1120-nf] but not as if He made a mock of[fn-64-P6438_1900230:1121-nf] the burdens of the law with any feeling of detestation towards it. For how could He have felt aversion to the law, who used with so much earnestness to upbraid them for passing over its weightier matters, alms-giving, hospitality,[fn-64-P6439_1900483:1122-nf] and the love of God? Nor, indeed, was it only these great things (which He recognized), but even[fn-64-P6440_1900620:1123-nf] the tithes of rue and the cleansing of cups. But, in truth, He would rather have deemed them excusable for being unable to carry burdens which could not be borne. What, then, are the burdens which He censures?[fn-64-P6441_1900847:1124-nf] None but those which they were accumulating of their own accord, when they taught for commandments the doctrines of men; for the sake of private advantage joining house to house, so as to deprive their neighbour of his own; cajoling[fn-64-P6442_1901096:1125-nf] the people, loving gifts, pursuing rewards, robbing the poor of the rights of judgment, that they might have the widow for a prey and the fatherless for a spoil.[fn-64-P6443_1901278:1126-nf] Of these Isaiah also says, \"Woe unto them that are strong in Jerusalem!\"[fn-64-P6444_1901389:1127-nf] and again, \"They that demand you shall rule over you.\"[fn-64-P6445_1901470:1128-nf] And who did this more than the lawyers?[fn-64-P6446_1901646:1129-nf] Now, if these offended Christ, it was as belonging to Him that they offended Him. He would have aimed no blow at the teachers of an alien law. But why is a \"woe\" pronounced against them for \"building the sepulchres of the prophets whom their fathers had killed? \"[fn-64-P6447_1901964:1130-nf] They rather deserved praise, because by such an act of piety they seemed to show that they did not allow the deeds of their fathers. Was it not because (Christ) was jealous[fn-64-P6448_1902159:1131-nf] of such a disposition as the Marcionites denounce, visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the fourth generation? What \"key,\" indeed, was it which these lawyers had,[fn-64-P6449_1902359:1132-nf] but the interpretation of the law? Into the perception of this they neither entered themselves, even because they did not believe (for \"unless ye believe, ye shall not understand\"); nor did they permit others to enter, because they preferred to teach them for commandments even the doctrines of men. When, therefore, He reproached those who did not themselves enter in, and also shut the door against others, must He be regarded as a disparager of the law, or as a supporter of it? If a disparager, those who were hindering the law ought to have been pleased; if a supporter, He is no longer an enemy of the law.[fn-64-P6450_1902994:1133-nf] But all these imprecations He uttered in order to tarnish the Creator as a cruel Being,[fn-64-P6451_1903118:1134-nf] against whom such as offended were destined to have a \"woe.\" And who would not rather have feared to provoke a cruel Being,[fn-64-P6452_1903274:1135-nf] by withdrawing allegiance[fn-64-P6453_1903317:1136-nf] from Him?

Therefore even the Pharisee, who invited Him to dinner in the passage before us,[fn-64-P6417_1896363:1100-nf] expressed some surprise[fn-64-P6418_1896402:1101-nf] in His presence that He had not washed before He sat down to meat, in accordance with the law, since it was the God of the law that He was proclaiming.[fn-64-P6419_1896576:1102-nf] Jesus also interpreted the law to him when He told him that they \"made clean the outside of the cup and the platter, whereas their inward part was full of ravening and wickedness.\" This He said, to signify that by the cleansing of vessels was to be understood before God the purification of men, inasmuch as it was about a man, and not about an unwashed vessel, that even this Pharisee had been treating in His presence. He therefore said: \"You wash the outside of the cup,\" that is, the flesh, \"but you do not cleanse your inside part,\"[fn-64-P6420_1897137:1103-nf] that is, the soul; adding: \"Did not He that made the outside,\" that is, the flesh, \"also make the inward part,\" that is to say, the soul?-by which assertion He expressly declared that to the same God belongs the cleansing of a man's external and internal nature, both alike being in the power of Him who prefers mercy not only to man's washing,[fn-64-P6421_1897504:1104-nf] but even to sacrifice.[fn-64-P6422_1897545:1105-nf] For He subjoins the command: \"Give what ye possess as alms, and all things shall be clean unto you.\"[fn-64-P6423_1897697:1106-nf] Even if another god could have enjoined mercy, he could not have done so previous to his becoming known. Furthermore, it is in this passage evident that they[fn-64-P6424_1897877:1107-nf] were not reproved concerning their God, but concerning a point of His instruction to them, when He prescribed to them figuratively the cleansing of their vessels, but really the works of merciful dispositions.

For the whole point of the rebuke lay in this, that they cared about small matters in His service of course, to whom they failed to exhibit their weightier duties when He commanded them: \"Thou shalt love with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, the Lord thy God, who hath called thee out of Egypt.\"[fn-64-P6428_1898963:1111-nf] Besides, time enough had not yet passed to admit of Christ's requiring so premature-nay, as yet so distasteful[fn-64-P6429_1899096:1112-nf] -a love towards a new and recent, not to say a hardly i yet developed,[fn-64-P6430_1899184:1113-nf] deity.

Whether, indeed, it is as depreciating the Creator that he does not wish such trifles to be thought of, concerning which neither the crows nor the lilies labour, because, forsooth, they come spontaneously to hand[fn-64-P6495_1914219:1172-nf] by reason of their very worthlessness,[fn-64-P6496_1914284:1173-nf] will appear a little further on. Meanwhile, how is it that He chides them as being \"of little faith? \"[fn-64-P6497_1914414:1174-nf] What faith? Does He mean that faith which they were as yet unable to manifest perfectly in a god who has hardly yet revealed,[fn-64-P6498_1914563:1175-nf] and whom they were in process of learning as well as they could; or that faith which they for this express reason owed to the Creator, because they believed that He was of His own will supplying these wants of the human race, and therefore took no thought about them? Now, when He adds, \"For all these things do the nations of the world seek after,\"[fn-64-P6499_1914944:1176-nf] even by their not believing in God as the Creator and Giver of all things, since He was unwilling that they should be like these nations, He therefore upbraided them as being defective of faith in the same God, in whom He remarked that the Gentiles were quite wanting in faith. When He further adds, \"But your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things,\"[fn-65-P6500_1915328:1177-nf] I would first ask, what Father Christ would have to be here understood? If He points to their own Creator, He also affirms Him to be good, who knows what His children have need of; but if He refers to that other god, how does he know that food and raiment are necessary to man, seeing that he has made no such provision for him? For if he had known the want, he would have made the provision. If, however, he knows what things man has need of, and yet has failed to supply them, he is in the failure guilty of either malignity or weakness. But when he confessed that these things are necessary to man, he really affirmed that they are good. For nothing that is evil is necessary. So that he will not be any longer a depreciator of the works and the indulgences of the Creator, that I may here complete the answer[fn-65-P6501_1916165:1178-nf] which I deferred giving above. Again, if it is another god who has foreseen man's wants, and is supplying them, how is it that Marcion's Christ himself promises them?[fn-65-P6502_1916353:1179-nf] Is he liberal with another's property?[fn-65-P6503_1916415:1180-nf] \"Seek ye,\" says he, \"the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you\"-by himself, of course. But if by himself, what sort of being is he, who shall bestow the things of another? If by the Creator, whose all things are, then who[fn-65-P6504_1916686:1181-nf] is he that promises what belongs to another? If these things are \"additions\" to the kingdom, they must be placed in the second rank;[fn-65-P6505_1916836:1182-nf] and the second rank belongs to Him to whom the first also does; His are the food and raiment, whose is the kingdom. Thus to the Creator belongs the entire promise, the full reality[fn-65-P6506_1917041:1183-nf] of its parables, the perfect equalization[fn-65-P6507_1917100:1184-nf] of its similitudes; for these have respect to none other than Him to whom they have a parity of relation in every point.[fn-65-P6508_1917243:1185-nf] We are servants because we have a Lord in our God. We ought \"to have our loins girded: \"[fn-65-P6509_1917368:1186-nf] in other words, we are to be free from the embarrassments of a perplexed and much occupied life; \"to have our lights burning,\"[fn-65-P6510_1917518:1187-nf] that is, our minds kindled by faith, and resplendent with the works of truth. And thus \"to wait for our Lord,\"[fn-65-P6511_1917652:1188-nf] that is, Christ. Whence \"returning? \"If \"from the wedding,\" He is the Christ of the Creator, for the wedding is His. If He is not the Creator's, not even Marcion himself would have gone to the wedding, although invited, for in his god he discovers one who hates the nuptial bed. The parable would therefore have failed in the person of the Lord, if He were not a Being to whom a wedding is consistent. In the next parable also he makes a flagrant mistake, when he assigns to the person of the Creator that \"thief, whose hour, if the father of the family had only known, he would not have suffered his house to be broken through.\"[fn-65-P6512_1918305:1189-nf] How can the Creator wear in any way the aspect of a thief, Lord as He is of all mankind? No one pilfers or plunders his own property, but he[fn-65-P6513_1918469:1190-nf] rather acts the part of one who swoops down on the things of another, and alienates man from his Lord.[fn-65-P6514_1918598:1191-nf] Again, when He indicates to us that the devil is \"the thief,\" whose hour at the very beginning of the world, if man had known, he would never have been broken in upon[fn-65-P6515_1918805:1192-nf] by him, He warns us \"to be ready,\" for this reason, because \"we know not the hour when the Son of man shall come\"[fn-65-P6516_1918939:1193-nf] -not as if He were Himself the thief, but rather as being the judge of those who prepared not themselves, and used no precaution against the thief. Since, then, He is the Son of man, I hold Him to be the Judge, and in the Judge I claim[fn-65-P6517_1919197:1194-nf] the Creator. If then in this passage he displays the Creator's Christ under the title \"Son of man,\" that he may give us some presage[fn-65-P6518_1919348:1195-nf] of the thief, of the period of whose coming we are ignorant, you still have it ruled above, that no one is the thief of his own property; besides which, there is our principle also unimpaired[fn-65-P6519_1919560:1196-nf] -that in as far as He insists on the Creator as an object of fear, in so far does He belong to the Creator, and does the Creator's work. When, therefore, Peter asked whether He had spoken the parable \"unto them, or even to all,\"[fn-65-P6520_1919805:1197-nf] He sets forth for them, and for all who should bear rule in the churches, the similitude of stewards.[fn-65-P6521_1919930:1198-nf] That steward who should treat his fellow-servants well in his Lord's absence, would on his return be set as ruler over all his property; but he who should act otherwise should be severed, and have his portion with the unbelievers, when his lord should return on the day when he looked not for him, at the hour when he was not aware[fn-65-P6522_1920280:1199-nf] -even that Son of man, the Creator's Christ, not a thief, but a Judge. He accordingly, in this passage, either presents to us the Lord as a Judge, and instructs us in His character,[fn-65-P6523_1920488:1200-nf] or else as the simply good god; if the latter, he now also affirms his judicial attribute, although the heretic refuses to admit it. For an attempt is made to modify this sense when it is applied to his god,-as if it were an act of serenity and mildness simply to sever the man off, and to assign him a portion with the unbelievers, under the idea that he was not summoned (before the judge), but only returned to his own state! As if this very process did not imply a judicial act! What folly! What will be the end of i the severed ones? Will it not be the forfeiture of salvation, since their separation will be from those who shall attain salvation? What, again, will be the condition of the unbelievers? Will it not be damnation? Else, if these severed and unfaithful ones shall have nothing to suffer, there will, on the other hand, be nothing for the accepted and the believers to obtain. If, however, the accepted and the believers shall attain salvation, it must needs be that the rejected and the unbelieving should incur the opposite issue, even the loss of salvation. Now here is a judgment, and He who holds it out before us belongs to the Creator. Whom else than the God of retribution can I understand by Him who shall \"beat His servants with stripes,\" either \"few or many,\" and shall exact from them what He had committed to them? Whom is it suitable[fn-65-P6524_1921881:1201-nf] for me to obey, but Him who remunerates? Your Christ proclaims, \"I am come to send fire on the earth.\"[fn-65-P6525_1922000:1202-nf] That[fn-65-P6526_1922028:1203-nf] most lenient being, the lord who has no hell, not long before had restrained his disciples from demanding fire on the churlish village. Whereas He[fn-65-P6527_1922208:1204-nf] burnt up Sodom and Gomorrah with a tempest of fire. Of Him the psalmist sang, \"A fire shall go out before Him, and burn up His enemies round about.\"[fn-65-P6528_1922385:1205-nf] By Hoses He uttered the threat, \"I will send a fire upon the cities of Judah; \"[fn-65-P6529_1922488:1206-nf] and[fn-65-P6530_1922516:1207-nf] by Isaiah, \"A fire has been kindled in mine anger.\" He cannot lie. If it is not He who uttered His voice out of even the burning bush, it can be of no importance[fn-65-P6531_1922854:1208-nf] what fire you insist upon being understood. Even if it be but figurative fire, yet, from the very fact that he takes from my element illustrations for His own sense, He is mine, because He uses what is mine. The similitude of fire must belong to Him who owns the reality thereof. But He will Himself best explain the quality of that fire which He mentioned, when He goes on to say, \"Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division.\"[fn-65-P6532_1923344:1209-nf] It is written \"a sword,\"[fn-65-P6533_1923392:1210-nf] but Marcion makes an emendation[fn-65-P6534_1923880:1211-nf] of the word, just as if a division were not the work of the sword. He, therefore, who refused to give peace, intended also the fire of destruction. As is the combat, so is the burning. As is the sword, so is the flame. Neither is suitable for its lord. He says at last, \"The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother-in-law against the daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law.\"[fn-65-P6535_1924476:1212-nf] Since this battle among the relatives[fn-65-P6536_1924537:1213-nf] was sung by the prophet's trumpet in the very words, I fear that Micah[fn-65-P6537_1924627:1214-nf] must have predicted it to Marcion's Christ!

They ask of me now a righteous judgment, and desire to approach to God, saying, What! because we have fasted, and Thou hast not seen: we have humiliated our souls, and Thou hast not known. For in the days of fasting are found your own wills; for either ye torment those who are subjected to you, or ye fast for strifes and judgments, or ye strike your neighbours with fists. For what do you fast unto me, that to-day your voice should be heard in clamour? This fast I have not chosen, save that a man should humble his soul. And if thou shalt bend thy neck like a ring, and spread under thee sackcloth and ashes, neither thus shall it be called an acceptable fast. Not such a fast have I chosen, saith the Lord; but loose every knot of unrighteousness, let go the chokings of impotent engagements.[fn-85-P8547_2778420:334-nf] Send away the harassed into rest, and scatter every unrighteous contract. Break thy bread to the hungry, and bring the houseless poor into thy dwelling. If thou seest the naked, clothe him; and despise not them of thy own seed in thy house. Then shall thy seasonable light break forth, and thy garments shall quickly arise; and righteousness shall go before thee: and the glory of God shall surround thee. Then thou shalt cry out, and God shall hear thee; while thou art yet speaking, He shall say, Here I am.\"[fn-85-P8548_2778966:335-nf] Concerning this same thing in Job: \"I have preserved the needy from the hand of the mighty; and I have helped the orphan, to whom there was no helper. The mouth of the widow blessed me, since I was the eye of the blind; I was also the foot of the lame, and the father of the weak.\"[fn-85-P8549_2779272:336-nf] Of this same matter in Tobit: \"And I said to Tobias, My son, go and bring whatever poor man thou shalt find out of our brethren, who still has God in mind with his whole heart. Bring him hither, and he shall eat my dinner together with me. Behold, I attend thee, my son, until thou come.\"[fn-85-P8550_2779594:337-nf] Also in the same place: \"All the days of thy life, my son, keep God in mind, and transgress not His precepts. Do justice all the days of thy life, and do not walk in the way of unrighteousness; because if thou act truly, there will be respect of thy works. Give alms of thy substance, and turn not thy face from any poor man. So shall it come to pass that the face of God shall not be turned away from thee. Even as thou hast, my son, so do: if thou hast abundant substance, give the more alms therefrom; if thou hast little, communicate even of that little. And do not fear when thou givest alms: thou layest up for thyself a good reward against the day of need; because alms delivereth from death, and does not suffer to go into darkness. Alms is a good office for all who do it in the sight of the most high God.\"[fn-85-P8551_2780430:338-nf] On this same subject in Solomon in Proverbs: \"He that hath pity on the poor lendeth unto the Lord.\"[fn-85-P8552_2780552:339-nf] Also in the same place: \"He that giveth to the poor shall never want; but he who turns away his eye shall be in much penury.\"[fn-85-P8553_2780700:340-nf] Also in the same place: \"Sins are purged away by alms-giving and faith.\"[fn-85-P8554_2780798:341-nf] Again, in the same place: \"If thine enemy hunger, feed him; and if he thirst, give him to drink: for by doing this thou shalt scatter live coals upon his head.\"[fn-85-P8555_2780980:342-nf] Again, in the same place: \"As water extinguishes fire, so alms-giving extinguishes sin.\"[fn-85-P8556_2781091:343-nf] In the same in Proverbs: \"Say not, Go away, and return, to-morrow I will give; when you can do good immediately. For thou knowest not what may happen on the coming day.\"[fn-85-P8557_2781285:344-nf] Also in the same place: \"He who stoppeth his ears that he may not hear the weak, shall himself call upon God, and there shall be none to hear him.\"[fn-85-P8558_2781455:345-nf] Also in the same place: \"He who has his conversation without reproach in righteousness, leaves blessed children.\"[fn-85-P8559_2781591:346-nf] In the same in Ecclesiasticus: \"My son, if thou hast, do good by thyself, and present worthy offerings to God; remember that death delayeth not.\"[fn-85-P8560_2781757:347-nf] Also in the same place: \"Shut up alms in the heart of the poor, and this will entreat for thee from all evil.\"[fn-85-P8561_2781892:348-nf] Concerning this thing in the thirty-sixth Psalm, that mercy is beneficial also to one's posterity: \"I have been young, and I have also grown old; and I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging their bread. The whole day he is merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is in blessing.\"[fn-85-P8562_2782214:349-nf] Of this same thing in the fortieth Psalm: \"Blessed is he who considereth over the poor and needy: in the evil day God will deliver him.\"[fn-85-P8563_2782378:350-nf] Also in the cxith Psalm: \"He hath distributed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness shall remain from generation to generation.\"[fn-85-P8564_2782534:351-nf] Of this same thing in Hosea: \"I desire mercy rather than sacrifice, and the knowledge of God more than whole burnt-offerings.\"[fn-85-P8565_2782681:352-nf] Of this same thing also in the Gospel according to Matthew: \"Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be satisfied.\"[fn-85-P8566_2782851:353-nf] Also in the same place: \"Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.\"[fn-85-P8567_2782951:354-nf] Also in the same place: \"Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not dig through and steal: for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\"[fn-85-P8568_2783188:355-nf] Also in the same place: \"The kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchantman seeking goodly pearls: and when he hath found a precious pearl, he went away and sold all that he had, and bought it.\"[fn-85-P8569_2783406:356-nf] That even a small work is of advantage, also in the same place: \"And whoever shall give to drink to one of the least of these a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, His reward shall not perish.\"[fn-85-P8570_2783660:357-nf] That alms are to be denied to none, also in the same place: \"Give to every one that asketh thee; and from him who would wish to borrow, be not turned away.\"[fn-85-P8571_2783837:358-nf] Also in the same place: \"If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. He saith, Which? Jesus saith unto him, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Honour thy father and mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. The young man saith unto Him, All these things have I observed: what lack I yet? Jesus saith unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.\"[fn-85-P8572_2784383:359-nf] Also in the same place: \"When the Son of man shall come in His majesty, and all the angels with Him, then He shall sit on the throne of His glory: and all nations shall be gathered together before Him; and He shall separate them one from another, even as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats: and He shall place the sheep on the right hand, but the goats on the left hand. Then shall the King say unto them that are on His right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, receive the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world. For I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me to drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. Then shall the righteous answer Him, and say, Lord, when saw we Thee[fn-85-P8573_2785235:360-nf] a stranger, and took Thee in: naked, and clothed Thee? And when saw we Thee sick, and in prison, and came to Thee? And the King, answering, shall say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it to one of the least of these my brethren, ye did it unto me. Then shall He say unto them who are on His left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, which my Father hath prepared for the devil and his angels: for I was hungry, and ye gave me not to eat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me not to drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: I was naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. Then shall they also answer, and say, Lord, when saw we Thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto Thee? And He shall answer them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not unto me. And these shall go away into everlasting burning: but the righteous into life eternal.\"[fn-85-P8574_2786373:361-nf] Concerning this same matter in the Gospel according to Luke: \"Sell your possessions, and give alms.\"[fn-85-P8575_2786499:362-nf] Also in the same place: \"He who made that which is within, made that which is without also. But give alms, and, behold, all things are pure unto you.\"[fn-85-P8576_2786671:363-nf] Also in the same place: \"Behold, the half of my substance I give to the poor; and if I have defrauded any one of anything, I restore him fourfold. And Jesus said unto him, that salvation has this day been wrought for this house, since he also is a son of Abraham.\"[fn-85-P8577_2786960:364-nf] Of this same thing also in the second Epistle to the Corinthians: \"Let your abundance supply their want, that their abundance also may be the supplement of your want, that there may be equality: as it is written, He who had much had not excess; and he who had little had no lack.\"[fn-85-P8578_2787264:365-nf] Also in the same place: \"He who soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he who soweth in blessing shall reap also of blessing. But let every one do as he has proposed in his heart: not as if sorrowfully, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.\"[fn-85-P8579_2787555:366-nf] Also in the same place: \"As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.\"[fn-85-P8580_2787714:367-nf] Likewise in the same place: \"Now he who ministereth seed to the sower, shall both supply bread to be eaten, and shall multiply your seed, and shall increase the growth of the fruits of your righteousness: that in all things ye may be made rich.\"[fn-85-P8581_2787981:368-nf] Also in the same place: \"The administration of this service has not only supplied that which is lacking to the saints, but has abounded by much giving of thanks unto God.\"[fn-85-P8582_2788179:369-nf] Of this same matter in the Epistle of John: \"Whoso hath this world's substance, and seeth his brother desiring, and shutteth up his bowels from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? \"[fn-85-P8583_2788389:370-nf] Of this same thing in the Gospel according to Luke: \"When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor brethren, nor neighbours, nor the rich; lest haply they also invite thee again, and a recompense be made thee. But when thou makest a banquet, call the poor, the weak, the blind, and lame: and thou shalt be blessed; because they have not the means of rewarding thee: but thou I shalt be recompensed in the resurrection of the I just.\"[fn-85-P8584_2788865:371-nf] ","title":"Treatise XII.

It is written in the Gospel, of the mother and brethren of Christ, that is, His kindred after the flesh, that, when word had been brought to Him, and they were standing without, because they could not come to Him by reason of the crowd, He made answer, \"Who is My mother? or who are My brethren? and stretching forth His Hand over His disciples, He saith, These are My brethren: and whosoever shall have done the will of My Father, that man is to Me brother, and mother, and sister.\"[fn-38-P3880_1842090:5-nf] What else teaching us, than to prefer to kindred after the flesh, our descent after the Spirit: and that men are not blessed for this reason, that they are united by nearness of flesh unto just and holy men, but that, by obeying and following, they cleave unto their doctrine and conduct. Therefore Mary is more blessed in receiving the faith of Christ,than in conceiving the flesh of Christ. For to a certain one who said, \"Blessed is the womb, which bare Thee,\"[fn-38-P3881_1842575:6-nf] He Himself made answer, \"Yea, rather, blessed are they who hear the Word of God, and keep it.\" Lastly, to His brethren, that is, His kindred after the flesh, who believed not in Him, what profit was there in that being of kin? Thus also her nearness as a Mother would have been of no profit to Mary, had she not borne Christ in her heart after a more blessed manner than in her flesh.","title":"Of Holy Virginity.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_12_tractate_vii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"11. For those who have a cause, and wish to supplicate the emperor, seek for some one skilled in the law, and trained in the schools, to compose their petition for them; lest perchance, if they ask in an unbecoming manner, they not only do not obtain what they seek, but get punishment instead of a benefit. When, therefore, the apostles sought to petition, and could not find how to approach the Emperor God, they said unto Christ, \"Lord, teach us to pray;\" that is to say, \"O thou who art our skilled One in the law, our Assessor, yea, the Concessor of God, compose for us prayers.\" And the Lord taught them from the book of the celestial law, taught them how to pray; and in that which He taught, He laid down a certain condition: \"Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.\"[fn-5-P528_224685:19-nf] If thou seekest not according to the law, thou becomest guilty. Dost thou not tremble before the Emperor, having become guilty? Offer the sacrifice of humility, offer the sacrifice of mercy; pray, saying, Forgive me, for I also forgive. But if thou sayest, do. For what wilt thou do? whither wilt thou go if thou hast lied in thy prayers? Not as it is said in the forum, thou shalt lose the benefit of the rescript; but thou shall not obtain a rescript. For it is the law of the forum that he who shall have lied in his petition shall derive no benefit from that which he has obtained. But this among men, because a man can be deceived: the emperor might have been deceived, when thou didst address to him thy petition; for thou saidest what thou wouldest, and he to whom thou didst speak knew not whether it was true or false; he sent thee away to thy adversary to be confuted if possible, so that if before the judge thou shouldest be convicted of falsehood (because he was not able not to grant the rescript, not knowing whether thou hadst lied), thou shouldest lose the benefit of the rescript, in the place to which thou hadst taken it. But God, who knows whether thou liest or speakest the truth, does not cause thee to lose in the judgment the benefit, but does not permit thee to obtain it, because thou hast dared to lie to the Truth.","title":"Tractate VII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":29,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_27_book_v_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"292","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"231. \"This generation,\" it says, \"is an evil generation.

Do thou, therefore, O lover of this festival, when thou hast considered well the glorious mysteries of Bethlehem, which were brought to pass for thy sake, gladly join thyself to the heavenly host, which is celebrating magnificently thy salvation.[fn-60-P6029_1842003:21-nf] As once David did before the ark, so do thou, before this virginal throne, joyfully lead the dance. Hymn with gladsome song the Lord, who is always and everywhere present, and Him who from Teman,[fn-60-P6030_1842219:22-nf] as says the prophet, hath thought fit to appear, and that in the flesh, to the race of men. Say, with Moses, \"He is my God, and I will glorify Him; my father's God, and I will exalt Him.\"[fn-60-P6031_1842425:23-nf] Then, after thine hymn of thanksgiving, we shall usefully inquire what cause aroused the King of Glory to appear in Bethlehem. His compassion for us compelled Him, who cannot be compelled, to be born in a human body at Bethlehem. But what necessity was there that He, when a suckling infant,[fn-60-P6032_1842735:24-nf] that He who, though both in time, was not limited by time, that He, who though wrapped in swaddling clothes, was not by them held fast, what necessity was there that He should be an exile and a stranger from His country? Should you, forsooth, wish to know this, ye congregation most holy, and upon whom the Spirit of God hath breathed, listen to Moses proclaiming plainly to the people, stimulating them, as it were, to the knowledge of this extraordinary nativity, and saying, \"Every male that openeth the womb, shall be called holy to the Lord.\"[fn-60-P6033_1843941:25-nf] O wondrous circumstance! \"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!\"[fn-60-P6034_1844056:26-nf] It became indeed the Lord of the law and the prophets to do all things in accordance with His own law, and not to make void the law, but to fulfil it, and rather to connect with the fulfilment of the law the beginning of His grace. Therefore it is that the mother, who was superior to the law, submits to the law. And she, the holy and undefiled one, observes that time of forty days that was appointed for the unclean. And He who makes us free from the law, became subject to the law; and there is offered for Him, who hath sanctified us, a pair of clean birds,[fn-60-P6035_1844637:27-nf] in testimony of those who approach clean and blameless. Now that that parturition was polluted, and stood not in need of expiatory victims, Isaiah is our witness, who proclaims distinctly to the whole earth under the sun: \"Before she travailed,\" he says, \"she brought forth before her pains came, she escaped, and brought forth a man-child.\"[fn-60-P6036_1844997:28-nf] Who hath heard such a thing? Who hath seen such things? The must holy virgin mother, therefore, escaped entirely the manner of women even before she brought forth: doubtless, in order that the Holy Spirit, betrothing her unto Himself, and sanctifying her, she might conceive without intercourse with man. She hath brought forth her first-born Son, even the only-begotten Son of God, Him, I say, who in the heavens above shone forth as the only-begotten, without mother, froth out His Father's substance, and preserved the virginity of His natural unity undivided and inseparable; and who on earth, in the virgin's nuptial chamber, joined to Himself the nature of Adam, like a bridegroom, by an inalienable union, and preserved His mother's purity uncorrupt and un injured-Him, in short, who in heaven was begotten without corruption, and on earth brought forth in a manner quite unspeakable. But to return to our subject.","title":"Oration Concerning Simeon and Anna","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":11,"verse":27,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_39_on_the_flesh_of_christ_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"43","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But whenever a dispute arises about the nativity, all who reject it as creating a presumption in favour of the reality of Christ's flesh, wilfully deny that God Himself was born, on the ground that He asked, \"Who is my mother, and who are my brethren? \"[fn-93-P9361_2572265:100-nf] Let, therefore, Apelles hear what was our answer to Marcion in that little work, in which we challenged his own (favourite) gospel to the proof, even that the material circumstances of that remark (of the Lord's) should be considered.[fn-93-P9362_2572541:101-nf] First of all, nobody would have told Him that His mother and brethren were standing outside, if he were not certain both that He had a mother and brethren, and that they were the very persons whom he was then announcing,-who had either been known to him before, or were then and there discovered by him; although heretics[fn-93-P9363_2572900:102-nf] have removed this passage from the gospel, because those who were admiring His doctrine said that His supposed father, Joseph the carpenter, and His mother Mary, and His brethren, and His sisters, were very well known to them. But it was with the view of tempting Him, that they had mentioned to Him a mother and brethren which He did not possess. The Scripture says nothing of this, although it is not in other instances silent when anything was done against Him by way of temptation. \"Behold,\" it says, \"a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted Him.\"[fn-93-P9364_2573482:103-nf] And in another passage: \"The Pharisees also came unto Him, tempting Him.\" Who[fn-93-P9365_2573579:104-nf] was to prevent its being in this place also indicated that this was done with the view of tempting Him? I do not admit what you advance of your own apart from Scripture. Then there ought to be suggested[fn-93-P9366_2573835:105-nf] some occasion[fn-93-P9367_2573865:106-nf] for the temptation. What could they have thought to be in Him which required temptation? The question, to be sure, whether He had been born or not? For if this point were denied in His answer, it might come out on the announcement of a temptation. And yet no temptation, when aiming at the discovery of the point which prompts the temptation by its doubtfulness, falls upon one so abruptly, as not to be preceded by the question which compels the temptation whilst raising the doubt. Now, since the nativity of Christ had never come into question, how can you contend that they meant by their temptation to inquire about a point on which they had never raised a doubt? Besides,[fn-93-P9368_2574559:107-nf] if He had to be tempted about His birth, this of course was not the proper way of doing it,-by announcing those persons who, even on the supposition of His birth, might possibly not have been in existence. We have all been born, and yet all of us have not either brothers or mother. He might with more probability have had even a father than a mother, and uncles more likely than brothers. Thus is the temptation about His birth unsuitable, for it might have been contrived without any mention of either His mother or His brethren. It is clearly more credible that, being certain that He had both a mother and brothers, they tested His divinity rather than His nativity, whether, when within, He knew what was without; being tried by the untrue announcement of the presence of persons who were not present. But the artifice of a temptation might have been thwarted thus: it might have happened that He knew that those whom they were announcing to be \"standing without,\" were in fact absent by the stress either of sickness, or of business, or a journey which He was at the time aware of. No one tempts (another) in a way in which he knows that he may have himself to bear the shame of the temptation. There being, then, no suitable occasion for a temptation, the announcement that His mother and His brethren had actually turned up[fn-93-P9369_2575917:108-nf] recovers its naturalness. But there is some ground for thinking that Christ's answer denies His mother and brethren for the present, as even Apelles might learn. \"The Lord's brethren had not yet believed in Him.\"[fn-93-P9370_2576153:109-nf] So is it contained in the Gospel which was published before Marcion's time; whilst there is at the same time a want of evidence of His mother's adherence to Him, although the Marthas and the other Marys were in constant attendance on Him. In this very passage indeed, their unbelief is evident. Jesus was teaching the way of life, preaching the kingdom of God and actively engaged in healing infirmities of body and soul; but all the while, whilst strangers were intent on Him, His very nearest relatives were absent. By and by they turn up, and keep outside; but they do not go in, because, forsooth, they set small store[fn-93-P9371_2576796:110-nf] on that which was doing within; nor do they even wait,[fn-93-P9372_2576884:111-nf] as if they had something which they could contribute more necessary than that which He was so earnestly doing; but they prefer to interrupt Him, and wish to call Him away from His great work Now, I ask you, Apelles, or will you Marcion, please (to tell me), if you happened to be at a stage play, or had laid a wager[fn-93-P9373_2577230:112-nf] on a foot race or a chariot race, and were called away by such a message, would you not have exclaimed, \"What are mother and brothers to me? \"[fn-93-P9374_2577426:113-nf] And did not Christ, whilst preaching and manifesting God, fulfilling the law and the prophets, and scattering the darkness of the long preceding age, justly employ this same form of words, in order to strike the unbelief of those who stood outside, or to shake off the importunity of those who would call Him away from His work? If, however, He had meant to deny His own nativity, He would have found place, time, and means for expressing Himself very differently,[fn-93-P9375_2577974:114-nf] and not in words which might be uttered by one who had both a mother and brothers. When denying one's parents in indignation, one does not deny their existence, but censures their faults. Besides, He gave Others the preference; and since He shows their title to this favour-even because they listened to the word (of God)-He points out in what sense He denied His mother and His brethren. For in whatever sense He adopted as His own those who adhered to Him, in that did He deny as His[fn-93-P9376_2578526:115-nf] those who kept aloof from Him. Christ also is wont to do to the utmost that which He enjoins on others. How strange, then, would it certainly[fn-93-P9377_2578700:116-nf] have been, if, while he was teaching others not to esteem mother, or father, or brothers, as highly as the word of God, He were Himself to leave the word of God as soon as His mother and brethren were announced to Him! He denied His parents, then, in the sense in which He has taught us to deny ours-for God's work. But there is also another view of the case: in the abjured mother there is a figure of the synagogue, as well as of the Jews in the unbelieving brethren. In their person Israel remained outside, whilst the new disciples who kept close to Christ within, hearing and believing, represented the Church, which He called mother in a preferable sense and a worthier brotherhood, with the repudiation of the carnal relationship. It was in just the same sense, indeed, that He also replied to that exclamation (of a certain woman), not denying His mother's \"womb and paps,\" but designating those as more \"blessed who hear the word of God.\"[fn-93-P9378_2579691:117-nf] ","title":"On the Flesh of Christ.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":11,"verse":27,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_31_on_virginity","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"68","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But besides other things the action of Miriam the prophetess also gives rise to these surmisings of ours. Directly the sea was crossed she took in her hand a dry and sounding timbrel and conducted the women's dance[fn-28-P2835_1917946:131-nf] . By this timbrel the story may mean to imply virginity, as first perfected by Miriam; whom indeed I would believe to be a type of Mary the mother of God[fn-28-P2836_1918122:132-nf] . Just as the timbrel emits a loud sound because it is devoid of all moisture and reduced to the highest degree of dryness, so has virginity a clear and ringing report amongst men because it repels from itself the vital sap of merely physical life. Thus, Miriam's timbrel being a dead thing, and virginity being a deadening of the bodily passions, it is perhaps not very far removed from the bounds of probability[fn-28-P2837_1918838:133-nf] that Miriam was a virgin. However, we can but guess and surmise, we cannot clearly prove, that this was so, and that Miriam the prophetess led a dance of virgins, even though many of the learned have affirmed distinctly that she was unmarried, from the fact that the history makes no mention either of her marriage or of her being a mother; and surely she would have been named and known, not as \"the sister of Aaron[fn-28-P2838_1919290:134-nf] ,\" but from her husband, if she had had one; since the head of the woman is not the brother but the husband. But if, amongst a people with whom motherhood was sought after and classed as a blessing and, regarded as a public duty, the grace of virginity, nevertheless came to be regarded as a precious thing, how does it behove us to feel towards it, who do not \"judge\" of the Divine blessings[fn-28-P2839_1919704:135-nf] \"according to the flesh\"? Indeed it has been revealed in the oracles of God, on what occasion to conceive and to bring forth is a good thing, and what species of fecundity was desired by God's saints; for both the Prophet Isaiah and the divine Apostle have made this clear and certain. The one cries, \"From fear of Thee, O Lord, have I conceived[fn-28-P2840_1920198:136-nf] ;\" the other boasts that he is the parent of the largest family of any, bringing to the birth whole cities and nations; not the Corinthians and Galatians only whom by his travailings he moulded for the Lord, but all in the wide circuit from Jerusalem to Illyricum; his children filled the world, \"begotten\" by him in Christ through the Gospel[fn-28-P2841_1920668:137-nf] . In the same strain the womb of the Holy Virgin, which ministered to an Immaculate Birth, is pronounced blessed in the Gospel[fn-28-P2842_1920830:138-nf] ; for that birth did not annul the Virginity, nor did the Virginity impede so great a birth. When the \"spirit of salvation[fn-28-P2843_1920976:139-nf] ,\" as Isaiah names it, is being born, the willings of the flesh are useless. There is also a particular teaching of the Apostle, which harmonizes with this; viz. each man of us is a double man[fn-28-P2844_1921309:140-nf] ; one the outwardly visible, whose natural fate it is to decay; the other perceptible only in the secret of the heart, yet capable of renovation. If this teaching is true,-and it must be true[fn-28-P2845_1921523:141-nf] because Wisdom is speaking there,-then there is no absurdity in supposing a double marriage also which answers in every detail to either man; and, maybe, if one was to assert boldly that the body's virginity was the co-operator and the agent of the inward marriage, this assertion would not be much beside the probable fact.","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":11,"verse":42,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_41_treatise_on_rebuke_and_grace","source_chapter":46,"source_paragraph":"144","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"And what is written, that \"He wills all men' to be saved,\"[fn-66-P6606_2521126:154-nf] while yet all men are not saved, may be understood in many ways, some of which I have mentioned in other writings[fn-66-P6607_2521261:155-nf] of mine; but here I will say one thing: \"He wills all men to be saved,\" is so said that all the predestinated may be understood by it, because every kind of men is among them.

And so the title of serpent and the comparison to beasts most clearly suggests not the dignity of an angel but the infamy of an apostate. Finally the occasion of the envy and seduction, which led him to deceive man, arose from the ground of his previous fall, in that he saw that man, who had but recently been formed out of the dust of the ground, was to be called to that glory, from which he remembered that he himself, while still one of the princes, had fallen. And so that first fall of his, which was due to pride, and which obtained for him the name of the serpent, was followed by a second owing to envy: and as this one found him still in the possession of something upright so that he could enjoy some interchange of conference and counsel with man, by the Lord's sentence he was very properly cast down to the lowest depth, that he might no longer walk as before erect, and looking up on high, but should cleave to the ground and creep along, and be brought low upon his belly and feed upon the earthly food and works of sins, and henceforward proclaim his secret hostility, and put between himself and man an enmity that is to our advantage, and a discord that is to our profit, so that while men are on their guard against him as a dangerous enemy, he can no longer injure them by a deceptive show of friendship.","title":"VIII.

My tears have been my meat day and night,\"[fn-49-P4943_1785188:41-nf] declaring with daily crying and lamentation: \"Woe is me that my sojourning is prolonged;\" and: \"Too long hath my soul been a sojourner.\"[fn-49-P4944_1785349:42-nf] In another way do the tears flow forth, which without any conscience of deadly sin, yet still proceed from the fear of hell and the recollection of It hat terrible judgment, with the terror of which the prophet was smitten and prayed to God, saying: \"Enter not into judgment with Thy servant, for in Thy sight shall no man living be justified.\"[fn-49-P4945_1785714:43-nf] There is too another kind of tears, which are caused not by knowledge of one's self but by the hardness and sins of others; whereby Samuel is described as having wept for Saul, and both the Lord in the gospel and Jeremiah in former days for the city of Jerusalem, the latter thus saying: \"Oh, that my head were water and mine eyes a fountain of tears!

And this is clearly shown not only by the words of the Psalm itself, but also by its title, which runs as follows in the character of that poor person of whom it is said in the gospel that \"blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven:\"[fn-49-P4948_1786895:46-nf] \"A prayer of the poor when he was in distress and poured forth his prayer to God.\"[fn-49-P4949_1787002:47-nf] ","title":"IX.

For you have the fruits of an answer pointed out by our Lord's words in the case of the agreement of two persons; as it is said: \"If two of you shall agree upon earth touching anything for which they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.\"[fn-49-P4971_1790561:49-nf] You have another in the fulness of faith, which is compared to a grain of mustard-seed. \"For,\" He says, \"if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain: Be thou removed, and it shall be removed; and nothing shall be impossible to you.\"[fn-49-P4972_1790850:50-nf] You have it in continuance in prayer, which the Lord's words call, by reason of unwearied perseverance in petitioning, importunity: \"For, verily, I say unto you that if not because of his friendship, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as much as he needs.\"[fn-49-P4973_1791154:51-nf] You have it in the fruits of almsgiving: \"Shut up alms in the heart of the poor and it shall pray for thee in the time of tribulation.\"[fn-49-P4974_1791316:52-nf] You have it in the purifying of life and in works of mercy, as it is said: \"Loose the bands of wickedness, undo the bundles that oppress;\" and after a few words in which the barrenness of an unfruitful fast is rebuked, \"then,\" he says, \"thou shall call and the Lord shall hear thee; thou shalt cry, and He shall say, Here am I.\"[fn-49-P4975_1791669:53-nf] Sometimes also excess of trouble causes it to be heard, as it is said: \"When I was in trouble I called unto the Lord, and He heard me;\"[fn-49-P4976_1791838:54-nf] and again: \"Afflict not the stranger for if he crieth unto Me, I will hear him, for I am merciful.\"[fn-49-P4977_1791961:55-nf] You see then in how many ways the gift of an answer may be obtained, so that no one need be crushed by the despair of his conscience for securing those things which are salutary and eternal. For if in contemplating our wretchedness I admit that we are utterly destitute of all those virtues which we mentioned above, and that we have neither that laudable agreement of two persons, nor that faith which is compared to a grain of mustard seed, nor those works of piety which the prophet describes, surely we cannot be without that importunity which He supplies to all who desire it, owing to which alone the Lord promises that He will give whatever He has been prayed to give. And therefore we ought without unbelieving hesitation to persevere, and not to have the least doubt that by continuing in them we shall obtain all those things which we have asked according to the mind of God. For the Lord, in His desire to grant what is heavenly and eternal, urges us to constrain Him as it were by our importunity, as He not only does not despise or reject the importunate, but actually welcomes and praises them, and most graciously promises to grant whatever they have perseveringly hoped for; saying, \"Ask and ye shall receive: seek and ye shall find: knock and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it shall be opened;\"[fn-49-P4978_1793384:56-nf] and again: \"All things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive, and nothing shall be impossible to you.\"[fn-49-P4979_1793529:57-nf] And therefore even if all the grounds for being heard which we have mentioned are altogether wanting, at any rate the earnestness of importunity may animate us, as this is placed in the power of any one who wills without the difficulties of any merits or labours. But let not any suppliant doubt that he certainly will not be heard, so long as he doubts whether he is heard. But that this also shall be sought from the Lord unweariedly, we are taught by the example of the blessed Daniel, as, though he was heard from the first day on which he began to pray, he only obtained the result of his petition after one and twenty days.[fn-49-P4980_1794179:58-nf] Wherefore we also ought not to grow slack in the earnestness of the prayers we have begun, if we fancy that the answer comes but slowly, for fear lest perhaps the gift of the answer be in God's providence delayed, or the angel, who was to bring the Divine blessing to us, may when he comes forth from the Presence of the Almighty be hindered by the resistance of the devil, as it is certain that he cannot transmit and bring to us the desired boon, if he finds that we slack off from the earnestness of the petition made. And this would certainly have happened to the above mentioned prophet unless he had with incomparable steadfastness prolonged and persevered in his prayers until the twenty-first day. Let us then not be at all cast down by despair from the confidence of this faith of ours, even when we fancy that we are far from having obtained what we prayed for, and let us not have any doubts about the Lord's promise where He says: \"All things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing, ye shall receive.\"[fn-49-P4981_1795222:59-nf] For it is well for us to consider this saying of the blessed Evangelist John, by which the ambiguity of this question is clearly solved: \"This is,\" he says, \"the confidence which we have in Him, that whatsoever we ask according to His will, He heareth us.\"[fn-49-P4982_1795789:60-nf] He bids us then have a full and undoubting confidence of the answer only in those things which are not for our own advantage or for temporal comforts, but are in conformity to the Lord's will. And we are also taught to put this into our prayers by the Lord's Prayer, where we say \"Thy will be done,\"-Thine not ours. For if we also remember these words of the Apostle that \"we know not what to pray for as we ought\"[fn-49-P4983_1796228:61-nf] we shall see that we sometimes ask for things opposed to our salvation and that we are most providentially refused our requests by Him who sees what is good for us with greater right and truth than we can. And it is clear that this also happened to the teacher of the Gentiles when he prayed that the messenger of Satan who had been for his good allowed by the Lord's will to buffet him, might be removed, saying: \"For which I besought the Lord thrice that he might depart from me. And He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee, for strength is made perfect in weakness.\"[fn-49-P4984_1796840:62-nf] And this feeling even our Lord expressed when He prayed in the character[fn-49-P4985_1796933:63-nf] of man which He had taken, that He might give us a form of prayer as other things also by His example; saying thus: \"Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt,\"[fn-49-P4986_1797176:64-nf] though certainly His will was not discordant with His Father's will, \"For He had come to save what was lost and to give His life a ransom for many;\"[fn-49-P4987_1797346:65-nf] as He Himself says: \"No man taketh my life from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again.\"[fn-49-P4988_1797507:66-nf] In which character there is in the thirty-ninth Psalm the following sung by the blessed David, of the Unity of will which He ever maintained with the Father: \"To do Thy will: O My God, I am willing.\"[fn-49-P4989_1797727:67-nf] For even if we read of the Father: \"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son,\"[fn-49-P4990_1797852:68-nf] we find none the less of the Son: \"Who gave Himself for our sins.\"[fn-49-P4991_1797935:69-nf] And as it is said of the One: \"Who spared not His own Son, but gave Him for all of us,\"[fn-49-P4992_1798044:70-nf] so it is written of the other: \"He was offered because He Himself willed it.\"[fn-49-P4993_1798146:71-nf] And it is shown that the will of the Father and of the Son is in all things one, so that even in the actual mystery of the Lord's resurrection we are taught that there was no discord of operation. For just as the blessed Apostle declares that the Father brought about the resurrection of His body, saying: \"And God the Father, who raised Him from the dead,\"[fn-49-P4994_1798569:72-nf] so also the Son testifies that He Himself will raise again the Temple of His body, saying: \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again.\"[fn-49-P4995_1798808:73-nf] And therefore we being instructed by all these examples of our Lord which have been enumerated ought to end our supplications also with the same prayer, and always to subjoin this clause to all our petitions: \"Nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt.\"[fn-49-P4996_1799084:74-nf] But it is clear enough that one who does not[fn-49-P4997_1799204:75-nf] pray with attention of mind cannot observe that threefold reverence[fn-49-P4998_1800699:76-nf] which is usually practised in the assemblies of the brethren at the close of service.","title":"IX.

For the latter title, as I have said, does nettling more than signify all the works, individually and collectively, which have come to be at the will of God through the Word; but the title Father has its significance and its bearing only from the Son. And, whereas the Word surpasses things originated, by so much and more doth calling God Father surpass the calling Him Un-originate. For the latter is unscriptural and suspicious, because it has various senses; so that, when a man is asked concerning it, his mind is carried about to many ideas; but the word Father is simple and scriptural, and more accurate, and only implies the Son. And `Unoriginate' is a word of the Greeks, who know not the Son; but `Father' has been acknowledged and vouchsafed by our Lord. For He, knowing Himself whose Son He was, said, `I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me;' and, `He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father,' and `I and the Father are One[fn-55-P5514_2183925:189-nf] ;' but nowhere is He found to call the Father Unoriginate.

And it was His will that the Summary[fn-55-P5516_2184585:191-nf] of our faith should have the same bearing, in bidding us be baptized, not into the name of Unoriginate and originate, nor into the name of Creator and creature, but into the Name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

For My faith is she betrothed to whom it is said in the Song of Songs, \"Come from Lebanon, My spouse, coming and passing over to Me from the beginning of faith.\"[fn-53-P5384_2285065:10-nf] Therefore betrothed too, because faith is the beginning of betrothal. For something is promised by the bridegroom, and by this plighted faith is he held bound. Now to the fish the Lord opposed the serpent, to faith the devil. Wherefore to this betrothed one does the Apostle say, \"I have betrothed you to One Husband, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ.\" And, \"I fear lest as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds also should be corrupted from the purity which is in Christ;\"[fn-53-P5385_2285634:11-nf] that is, which is in the faith of Christ. For he says, \"That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.\"[fn-53-P5386_2285760:12-nf] Therefore let not the devil corrupt our faith, let him not devour the fish.","title":"Sermon LV. [CV.

For every day did the Pharisees wash themselves in water before they dined; as if a daily washing could be a cleansing of the heart. Then He showed what sort of persons they were. He told them who saw them; for He saw not their faces only but their inward parts. For that ye may know this, that Pharisee, to whom Christ made answer, thought within himself, he uttered nothing aloud, yet the Lord heard him. For within himself he blamed the Lord Christ, because He had so come to his feast without having washed. He was thinking, the Lord heard, therefore He answered.

Yea rather by rebuking He did spare him, that being reformed He might spare him in the judgment. And what is it that He showeth to us? That Baptism also which is conferred once for all, cleanses by faith. Now faith is within, not without.

How then doth He say to them, \"Give alms, and behold all things are clean unto you\"? If the Pharisees had paid heed to Him, and given alms, at once according to His word \"all things would have been clean to them;\" what need then was there for them to believe on Him?

Not wheat only, but wine, and oil; nor this only, but even the most trifling things, cummin, rue, mint, and anise,[fn-54-P5440_2304683:5-nf] in obdience to God's precept, they tithed all; put aside, that is, a tenth part, and gave alms of it.

For Scripture says that that which was born of Mary is of the Holy\nGhost.[fn-75-P7537_2772876:38-nf] Who also filled with righteousness\n(justitia) that which was created: for it says `He appeared in the flesh, was justified in the\nSpirit.'[fn-75-P7538_2773036:39-nf] Again: Who made Him also to be\nfeared by the devils: `For I,' He says, `by the Spirit of God cast out devils.'[fn-75-P7539_2773168:40-nf] Who also made His flesh a temple. `For I saw His\nspirit descending like a dove and abiding upon Him.'[fn-75-P7540_2773290:41-nf] Again: Who granted to Him His ascension into\nHeaven. For it says, \"Giving a commandment to the apostles whom He had chosen, by the Holy Ghost He\nwas taken up.\"[fn-75-P7541_2773466:42-nf] Finally that it was He who\ngranted such glory to Christ.\" The whole of your blasphemy then consists in this: that Christ had\nnothing of Himself: nor did He, a mere man, as you say, receive anything from the Word, i.e., the Son\nof God; but everything in Him was the gift of the Spirit. If thenwe can show that all that which you\nrefer to the Spirit, is His own, what remains but that we prove that He whom you therefore would have\ntaken to be a man, because as you say everything which He has is another's, is therefore God, because\neverything which He has is His own? And indeed we will prove this not only by discussion and\nargument, but by the voice of Divinity Itself: for nothing testifies of God better than things\ndivine. And because nothing knows itself better than the very glory of God, we believe nothing on the\nsubject of God with greater right than those writings in which God Himself is His own witness. First\nthen, as to this that you say that the Holy Spirit created His humanity; we might take it simply, if\nwe could acknowledge that you had not brought it forward in the interests of unbelief. For neither do\nwe deny that the flesh of the Lord was conceived by the Holy Ghost: but we assert that the body was\nconceived by the co-operation of the Holy Ghost in such a way that we can say that His\nHumanity[fn-75-P7542_2774807:43-nf] was created for Himself by the\nSon of God, as the Holy Spirit Itself says in holy Scripture, testifying that \"Wisdom hath builded\nfor Itself a house.\"[fn-75-P7543_2774977:44-nf] You see then that\nthat which was conceived by the Holy Ghost was built and perfected by the Son of God: not that the\nwork of the Son of God is one thing, and the work of the Holy Ghost another: but that through the\nunity of the Godhead and glory the operation of the Spirit is the building of the Son of God; and the\nbuilding of the Son of God is the co-operation of the Holy Ghost. And so we read not only that the\nHoly Ghost came upon the Virgin, but also that the power of the Most High overshadowed the Virgin;\nthat since Wisdom Itself is the fulness of the Godhead, no one might doubt that when Wisdom built\nItself a house all the fulness of the Godhead was present. But the wretched hardness of your\nblasphemy, while it tries to sever Christ from the Son of God, fails to see that it is entirely\nsevering the nature of the Godhead from Itself. Unless perhaps you believe that the house is\ntherefore built for Him by the Holy Ghost because He Himself was insufficient and incapable of\nbuilding for Himself an house. But it is as absurd as it is wild, to believe that He, whom we believe\nto have created the whole universe of things heavenly and earthly by His will, was unable to build\nfor Himself a body: especially as the power of the Holy Ghost is His power, and the Divinity and\nGlory of the Trinity are so united and inseparable, that we cannot think of anything at all in One\nPerson of the Trinity, which can be separated from the fulness of the Godhead. Therefore when this is\nlaid down and grasped; viz., that according to the faith of holy Scripture, when the Holy Ghost came\nupon (the Virgin) and the power of the Most High overshadowed her, Wisdom builded Itself an house;\nthe rest of the slanders of your blasphemy come to nothing. For neither is it doubtful that He made\nall things by Himself and in Himself, in whose name and faith, the faith even of believers can do\nanything. For neither did He need the aid of another, as neither have they needed it, who have\ntrusted in His power. And so as for your assertions that He was justified by the Spirit, and that the\nSpirit made Him to be feared by the devils, and that His flesh became the temple of the Holy Ghost,\nand that He was taken up by the Spirit into heaven, they are all blasphemous and wild: not because we\nare to believe that in all these things which He Himself did, the unity and cooperation of the Spirit\nwas wanting - since the Godhead is never wanting to Itself, and the [power of the Trinity was ever\npresent in the Saviour's works - but because you will have it that the Holy Ghost gave assistance to\nthe Lord Jesus Christ as if He had been feeble and powerless; and that He granted those things to\nHim, which He was unable to procure for Himself. Learn then from sacred witnesses to believe God, and\nnot to mingle falsehood with truth: for the subject does not admit it, and common sense abhors the\nidea of mingling the notions of the spirit of the devil with the witnesses that are Divine.","title":"Book VII.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":11,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_79_letter_x_for_338_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"2.

But if the baptism of heretics can have the regeneration of the second birth, those who are baptized among them must be counted not heretics, but children of God. For the second birth, which occurs in baptism, begets sons of God. But if the spouse of Christ is one, which is the Catholic Church, it is she herself who alone bears sons of God. For there are not many spouses of Christ, since the apostle says, \"I have espoused you, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ; \"[fn-64-P6425_2064936:21-nf] and, \"Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, for the King hath greatly desired thy beauty; \"[fn-64-P6426_2065097:22-nf] and, \"Come with me, my spouse, from Lebanon; thou shalt come, and shalt pass over from the source of thy faith; \"[fn-64-P6427_2065229:23-nf] and, \"I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse.\"[fn-64-P6428_2065302:24-nf] We see that one person is everywhere set forward, because also the spouse is one.

Whence also she cannot bear children of God; unless, as appears to Stephen, heresy indeed brings them forth and exposes them, while the Church takes them up when exposed, and nourishes those for her own whom she has not born, although she cannot be the mother of strange children.

Dust we are and unto dust we shall return.[fn-27-P2737_923451:75-nf] And He will send the Holy Ghost and create us and renew the face of the earth.[fn-27-P2738_923553:76-nf] For what the holy Paul calls resurrection David describes as renewal. Let us hear, once more, him who was caught into the third heaven. What does he say? \"You are the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you.\"[fn-27-P2739_923786:77-nf] Now every temple[fn-27-P2740_923823:78-nf] is a temple of God, and if we are a temple of the Holy Ghost, then the Holy Ghost is God. It is also called Solomon's temple, but this is in the sense of his being its builder. And if we are a temple of the Holy Ghost in this sense, then the Holy Ghost is God, for \"He that built all things is God.\"[fn-27-P2741_924303:79-nf] If we are a temple of one who is worshipped, and who dwells in us, let us confess Him to be God, for thou shale worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shall thou serve.[fn-27-P2742_924490:80-nf] Supposing them to object to the word \"God,\" let them learn what this word means. God is called Qeo\\j either because He placed (teqeike/nai) all things or because He beholds (Qea=sqai) all things. If He is called Qeo\\j because He \"placed\" or \"beholds\" all things, and the Spirit knoweth all the things of God, as the Spirit in us knoweth our things, then the Holy Ghost is God.[fn-27-P2743_924902:81-nf] Again, if the sword of the spirit is the word of God,[fn-27-P2744_925167:82-nf] then the Holy Ghost is God, inasmuch as the sword belongs to Him of whom it is also called the word. Is He named the right hand of the Father? For \"the right hand of the Lord bringeth mighty things to pass;\"[fn-27-P2745_925393:83-nf] and \"thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.\"[fn-27-P2746_925532:84-nf] But the Holy Ghost is the finger of God, as it is said \"if I by the finger of God cast out devils,\"[fn-27-P2747_925648:85-nf] of which the version in another Gospel is \"if I by the Spirit of God cast out devils.\"[fn-27-P2748_925753:86-nf] So the Holy Ghost is of the same nature as the Father and the Son.","title":"Letter VIII","author":"St. Basil"}]
