{"verses":["Now the publicans and sinners drew near unto him to hear him.","And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying:  This man\nreceiveth sinners and eateth with them.","And he spoke to them this parable, saying:","What man of you that hath an hundred sheep, and if he shall lose\none of them, doth he not leave the ninety-nine in the desert and go\nafter that which was lost, until he find it?","And when he hath found it, lay it upon his shoulders, rejoicing?","And coming home, call together his friends and neighbours, saying\nto them:  Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost?","I say to you that even so there shall be joy in heaven upon one\nsinner that doth penance, more than upon ninety-nine just who need not\npenance.","Or what woman having ten groats, if she lose one groat, doth not\nlight a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently until she find\nit?","And when she hath found it, call together her friends and\nneighbours, saying:  Rejoice with me, because I have found the groat\nwhich I had lost.","So I say to you, there shall be joy before the angels of God\nupon one sinner doing penance.","And he said:  A certain man had two sons.","And the younger of them said to his father:  Father, give me the\nportion of substance that falleth to me.  And he divided unto them his\nsubstance.","And not many days after, the younger son, gathering all\ntogether, went abroad into a far country:  and there wasted his\nsubstance, living riotously.","And after he had spent all, there came a mighty famine in that\ncountry:  and he began to be in want.","And he went and cleaved to one of the citizens of that country.\nAnd he sent him into his farm to feed swine.","And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks the swine\ndid eat:  and no man gave unto him.","And returning to himself, he said:  How many hired servants in my\nfather's house abound with bread, and I here perish with hunger!","I will arise and will go to my father and say to him:  Father, I\nhave sinned against heaven and before thee.","I am not worthy to be called thy son:  make me as one of thy\nhired servants.","And rising up, he came to his father.  And when he was yet a\ngreat way off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion and\nrunning to him fell upon his neck and kissed him.","And the son said to him:  Father:  I have sinned against heaven\nand before thee I am not now worthy to be called thy son.","And the father said to his servants:  Bring forth quickly the\nfirst robe and put it on him:  and put a ring on his hand and shoes on\nhis feet.","And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it:  and let us eat\nand make merry:","Because this my son was dead and is come to life again, was lost\nand is found.  And they began to be merry.","Now his elder son was in the field and when he came and drew\nnigh to the house, he heard music and dancing.","And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things\nmeant.","And he said to him:  Thy brother is come and thy father hath\nkilled the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe.","And he was angry and would not go in.  His father therefore\ncoming out began to entreat him.","And he answering, said to his father:  Behold, for so many years\ndo I serve thee and I have never transgressed thy commandment:  and yet\nthou hast never given me a kid to make merry with my friends.","But as soon as this thy son is come, who hath devoured his\nsubstance with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.","But he said to him:  Son, thou art always with me; and all I have\nis thine.","But it was fit that we should make merry and be glad:  for this\nthy brother was dead and is come to life again; he was lost, and is\nfound."]}
