{"verses":["And it came to pass that on one of the days, as he was teaching\nthe people in the temple and preaching the gospel, the chief priests\nand the scribes, with the ancients, met together,","And spoke to him, saying:  Tell us, by what authority dost thou\nthese things?  Or, who is he that hath given thee this authority?","And Jesus answering, said to them:  I will also ask you one thing.\nAnswer me:","The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?","But they thought within themselves, saying:  If we shall say, From\nheaven:  he will say:  Why then did you not believe in him?","But if we say, of men:  the whole people will stone us.  For they\nare persuaded that John was a prophet.","And they answered that they knew not whence it was.","And Jesus said to them:  Neither do I tell you by what authority I\ndo these things.","And he began to speak to the people this parable:  A certain man\nplanted a vineyard and let it out to husbandmen:  and he was abroad for\na long time.","And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they\nshould give him of the fruit of the vineyard.  Who, beating him, sent\nhim away empty.","And again he sent another servant.  But they beat him also and,\ntreating him reproachfully, sent him away empty.","And again he sent the third:  and they wounded him also and cast\nhim out.","Then the lord of the vineyard said:  What shall I do?  I will send\nmy beloved son.  It may be, when they see him, they will reverence him.","Whom, when the husbandmen saw, they thought within themselves,\nsaying:  This is the heir.  Let us kill him, that the inheritance may be\nours.","So casting him out of the vineyard, they killed him.  What\ntherefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them?","He will come and will destroy these husbandmen and will give the\nvineyard to others.  Which they hearing, said to him:  God forbid.","But he looking on them, said:  What is this then that is written,\nThe stone, which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of\nthe corner?","Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be bruised:  and upon\nwhomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.","And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him\nthe same hour:  but they feared the people, for they knew that he spoke\nthis parable to them.","And being upon the watch, they sent spies, who should feign\nthemselves just, that they might take hold of him in his words, that\nthey might deliver him up to the authority and power of the governor.","And they asked him, saying:  Master, we know that thou speakest\nand teachest rightly:  and thou dost not respect any person, but\nteachest the way of God in truth.","Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or no?","But he, considering their guile, said to them:  Why tempt you me?","Shew me a penny.  Whose image and inscription hath it?  They\nanswering, said to him:  Caesar's.","And he said to them:  Render therefore to Caesar the things, that\nare Caesar's:  and to God the things that are God's.","And they could not reprehend his word before the people:  and\nwondering at his answer, they held their peace.","And there came to him some of the Sadducees, who deny that there\nis any resurrection:  and they asked him,","Saying:  Master, Moses wrote unto us:  If any man's brother die,\nhaving a wife, and he leave no children, that his brother should take\nher to wife and raise up seed unto his brother.","There were therefore seven brethren:  and the first took a wife\nand died without children.","And the next took her to wife:  and he also died childless.","And the third took her.  And in like manner, all the seven:  and\nthey left no children and died.","Last of all the woman died also.","In the resurrection therefore, whose wife of them shall she be?\nFor all the seven had her to wife.","And Jesus said to them:  The children of this world marry and are\ngiven in marriage:","But they that shall be accounted worthy of that world and of the\nresurrection from the dead shall neither be married nor take wives.","Neither can they die any more for they are equal to the angels\nand are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.","Now that the dead rise again, Moses also shewed at the bush,\nwhen he called the Lord:  The God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and\nthe God of Jacob.","For he is not the God of the dead, but of the living:  for all\nlive to him.","And some of the scribes answering, said to him:  Master, thou\nhast said well.","And after that they durst not ask him any more questions.","But he said to them:  How say they that Christ is the son of\nDavid?","And David himself saith in the book of Psalms:  The Lord said to\nmy Lord, sit thou on my right hand,","Till I make thy enemies thy footstool.","David then calleth him Lord.  And how is he his son?","And in the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples:","Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes and love\nsalutations in the market place and the first chairs in the synagogues\nand the chief rooms at feasts:","Who devour the houses of widows, feigning long prayer.  These\nshall receive greater damnation."]}
