{"verses":["And it came to pass, that when the multitudes pressed upon him to\nhear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Genesareth,","And saw two ships standing by the lake:  but the fishermen were\ngone out of them and were washing their nets.","And going into one of the ships that was Simon's, he desired him\nto draw back a little from the land.  And sitting, he taught the\nmultitudes out of the ship.","Now when he had ceased to speak, he said to Simon:  Launch out into\nthe deep and let down your nets for a draught.","And Simon answering said to him:  Master, we have laboured all the\nnight and have taken nothing:  but at thy word I will let down the net.","And when they had done this, they enclosed a very great multitude\nof fishes:  and their net broke.","And they beckoned to their partners that were in the other ship,\nthat they should come and help them.  And they came and filled both the\nships, so that they were almost sinking.","Which when Simon Peter saw, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying:\nDepart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.","For he was wholly astonished, and all that were with him, at the\ndraught of the fishes which they had taken.","And so were also James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were\nSimon's partners.  And Jesus saith to Simon:  Fear not:  from henceforth\nthou shalt catch men.","And having brought their ships to land, leaving all things, they\nfollowed him.","And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man\nfull of leprosy who, seeing Jesus and falling on his face, besought him\nsaying:  Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.","And stretching forth his hand, he touched him, saying:  I will.  Be\nthou cleansed.  And immediately the leprosy departed from him.","And he charged him that he should tell no man, but:  Go, shew\nthyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing according as Moses\ncommanded, for a testimony to them.","But the fame of him went abroad the more:  and great multitudes\ncame together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities.","And he retired into the desert; and prayed.","And it came to pass on a certain day, as he sat teaching, that\nthere were also Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, that were\ncome out of every town of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem:  and the\npower of the Lord was to heal them.","And behold, men brought in a bed a man who had the palsy:  and\nthey sought means to bring him in and to lay him before him.","And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in,\nbecause of the multitude, they went up upon the roof and let him down\nthrough the tiles with his bed into the midst before Jesus.","Whose faith when he saw, he said:  Man, thy sins are forgiven\nthee.","And the scribes and Pharisees began to think, saying:  Who is this\nwho speaketh blasphemies?  Who can forgive sins, but God alone?","And when Jesus knew their thoughts, answering he said to them:\nWhat is it you think in your hearts?","Which is easier to say:  Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say:\nArise and walk?","But that you may know that the Son of man hath the power on earth\nto forgive sins (he saith to the sick of the palsy), I say to thee to:\nArise, take up thy bed and go into thy house.","And immediately rising up before them, he took up the bed on\nwhich he lay:  and he went away to his own house, glorifying God.","And all were astonished:  and they glorified God.  And they were\nfilled with fear, saying:  We have seen wonderful things to-day.","And after these things, he went forth and saw a publican named\nLevi, sitting at the receipt of custom:  and he said to him:  Follow me.","And leaving all things, he rose up and followed him.","And Levi made him a great feast in his own house:  And there was a\ngreat company of publicans and of others that were at table with them.","But the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying to his disciples:\nWhy do you eat and drink with publicans and sinners?","And Jesus answering, said to them:  They that are whole need not\nthe physician:  but they that are sick.","I came not to call the just, but sinners to penance.","And they said to him:  Why do the disciples of John fast often and\nmake prayers, and the disciples of the Pharisees in like manner; but\nthine eat and drink?","To whom he said:  Can you make the children of the bridegroom fast\nwhilst the bridegroom is with them?","But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away\nfrom them:  then shall they fast in those days.","And he spoke also a similitude to them:  That no man putteth a\npiece from a new garment upon an old garment:  otherwise he both rendeth\nthe new, and the piece taken from the new agreeth not with the old.","And no man putteth new wine into old bottles:  otherwise the new\nwine will break the bottles; and it will be spilled and the bottles\nwill be lost.","But new wine must be put into new bottles:  and both are\npreserved.","And no man drinking old hath presently a mind to new:  for he\nsaith:  The old is better."]}
