All this may perhaps seem to you matter for jesting, seeing that you take so much pleasure in comedies and lyrics and mimes like those of Lentulus;[fn-55-P5580_1555736:3964-nf] although so blunted is your wit that I am not disposed to allow that you can understand even language so simple. You may treat the words of prophets with contempt, but Amos will still make answer to you: \"Thus saith the Lord, For three transgressions and for four shall I not turn away from him?\"[fn-55-P5581_1556116:3965-nf] For inasmuch as Damascus, Gaza, Tyre, Edom, the Ammonites and the Moabites, the Jews also and the children of Israel, although God had often prophesied to them to turn and to repent, had refused to hear His voice, the Lord wishing to shew that He had most just cause for the wrath that he was going to bring upon them used the words already quoted, \"For three transgressions and for four shall I not turn away from them?\" It is wicked, God says, to harbour evil thoughts; yet I have allowed them to do so. It is still more wicked to carry them out; yet in My mercy and kindness I have permitted even this. But should the sinful thought have become the sinful deed? Should men in their pride have trampled thus on my tenderness? Nevertheless \"I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live;\"[fn-55-P5582_1556979:3966-nf] and as it is not they that are whole who need a physician but they that are sick,[fn-55-P5583_1557088:3967-nf] even after his sin I hold out a hand to the prostrate sinner and exhort him, polluted as he is in his own blood,[fn-55-P5584_1557222:3968-nf] to wash away his stains with tears of penitence. But if even then he shews himself unwilling to repent, and if, after he has suffered shipwreck, he refuses to clutch the plank which alone can save him, I am compelled at last to say: \"Thus saith the Lord, For three transgressions and for four shall I not turn away from him?\" For this \"turning away\" God accounts a punishment, inasmuch as the sinner is left to his own devices. It is thus that he visits the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation;[fn-55-P5585_1557783:3969-nf] not punishing those who sin immediately but pardoning their first offences and only passing sentence on them for their last. For if it were otherwise and if God were to stand forth on the moment as the avenger of iniquity, the church would lose many of its saints; and certainly would be deprived of the apostle Paul. The prophet Ezekiel, from whom we have quoted above, repeating God's words spoken to himself speaks thus: \"Open thy mouth and eat what I shall give thee. And behold,\" he says, \"an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein; and he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and a song, and woe.\"[fn-55-P5586_1558496:3970-nf] The first of these three belongs to you if you prove willing, as a sinner, to repent of your sins. The second belongs to those who are holy, who are called upon to sing praises to God; for praise does not become a sinner's mouth. And the third belongs to persons like you who in despair have given themselves over to uncleanness, to fornication, to the belly, and to the lowest lusts; men who suppose that death ends all and that there is nothing beyond it; who say: \"When the overflowing scourge shall pass through it shall not come unto us.\"[fn-55-P5587_1559086:3971-nf] The book which the prophet eats is the whole series of the Scriptures, which in turn bewail the penitent, celebrate the righteous, and curse the desperate. For nothing is so displeasing to God as an impenitent heart. Impenitence is the one sin for which there is no forgiveness. For if one who ceases to sin is pardoned even after he has sinned, and if prayer has power to bend the judge; it follows that every impenitent sinner must provoke his judge to wrath. Thus despair is the one sin for which there is no remedy. By obstinate rejection of God's grace men turn His mercy into sternness and severity. Yet, that you may know that God does every day call sinners to repentance, hear Isaiah's Words: \"In that day,\" he says, \"did the Lord God of Hosts call to weeping and to mourning and to baldness and to girding with sackcloth: and behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine; let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we shall die.\" After these words filled with the recklessness of despair the Scripture goes on to say: \"And it was revealed in my ears by the Lord of Hosts, Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die.\"[fn-55-P5588_1560295:3972-nf] Only when they become dead to sin, will their sin be forgiven them. For, so long as they live in sin, it cannot be put away.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":5,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_14_npnf1_14_06_homily_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-14","text":"From what country[fn-2-P212_18663:2-nf] then was he?

And yet, when you ask them, whether those that are not baptized, and are not made joint-heirs with Christ and par-takers of the kingdom of heaven, have at any rate the blessing of eternal life in the resurrection of the dead, they are extremely perplexed, and find no way out of their difficulty. For what Christian is there who would allow it to be said, that any one could attain to eternal salvation without being born again in Christ,-[a result] which He meant to be effected through baptism, at the very time when such a sacrament was purposely instituted for regenerating in the hope of eternal salvation? Whence the apostle says: \"Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us by the laver[fn-4-P418_359526:75-nf] of regeneration.\"[fn-4-P419_359559:76-nf] This salvation, however, he says, consists in hope, while we live here below, where he says, \"For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.\"[fn-4-P420_359855:77-nf] Who then could be so bold as to affirm, that without the regeneration of which the apostle speaks, infants could attain to eternal salvation, as if Christ died not for them? For \"Christ died for the ungodly.\"[fn-4-P421_360088:78-nf] As for them, however, who (as is manifest) never did an ungodly act in all their own life, if also they are not bound by any bond of sin in their original nature, how did He die for them, who died for the ungodly? If they were hurt by no malady of original sin, how is it they are carried to the Physician Christ, for the express purpose of receiving the sacrament of eternal salvation, by the pious anxiety of those who run to Him? Why rather is it not said to them in the Church: Take hence these innocents: \"they that are whole need not a physician, but they that are sick;\"-Christ \"came not to call the righteous, but sinners?\"[fn-4-P422_360736:79-nf] There never has been heard, there never is heard, there never will be heard in the Church, such a fiction concerning Christ.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":32,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_11_book_i_","source_chapter":42,"source_paragraph":"152","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"This reasoning will carry more weight, after I have collected the mass of Scripture testimonies which I have undertaken to adduce.

He that believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.\"[fn-5-P523_395769:129-nf] Now, who can be unaware that, in the case of infants, being baptized is to believe, and not being baptized is not to believe? From the Gospel of John we have already adduced some passages. However, I must alsorequest your attention to the following: JohnBaptist says of Christ, \"Behold the Lamb of God, Behold Him which taketh away the sin of the world;\"[fn-5-P524_396150:130-nf] and He too says of Himself, \"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish.\"[fn-5-P525_396324:131-nf] Now, inasmuch as infants are only able to become His sheep by baptism, it must needs come to pass that they perish if they are not baptized, because they will not have that eternal life which He gives to His sheep.

You have the Lord saying of the Pharisees, \"They sit in Moses' seat.\"[fn-65-P6522_2748520:16-nf] The Lord did not mean them only; as if He would send those who should believe on Christ to the school of the Jews, that they might learn there wherein is the way to the kingdom of heaven. Did not the Lord come for this end, that He might establish a Church, and separate those Jews who had a good faith, and a good hope, and a good love, as wheat from the chaff, and might make them one wall of the circumcision, to which should be joined another wall from the uncircumcision of the Gentiles, of which two walls coming from different directions, Himself should be the Corner-Stone? Did not the same Lord therefore say of these two people who were to be one, \"And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold\"? Now He was speaking to the Jews; \"Them also,\" said He, \"must I bring, that there may be one fold, and One Shepherd.\"[fn-65-P6523_2749370:17-nf] Therefore there were two ships[fn-65-P6524_2749418:18-nf] out of which He had called His disciples. They figured these two people, when they let down their nets, and took up so great a draught[fn-65-P6525_2749569:19-nf] and so large a number of fishes, that the nets were almost broken. \"And they laded,\" it is said, \"both the ships.\" The two ships figured the One Church, but made out of two peoples, joined together in Christ, though coming from different parts. Of this too the two wives, who had one husband Jacob, Leah and Rachel, are a figure.[fn-65-P6526_2749909:20-nf] Of these two, the two blind men also are a figure, who sat by the way side, to whom the Lord gave sight.[fn-65-P6527_2750038:21-nf] And if ye pay attention to the Scriptures, ye will find the two Churches, which are not two but One, figured out in many places. For to this end the Corner-Stone serveth, for to make of two One. To this end serveth That Shepherd, for to make of two flocks One. So then the Lord who was to teach the Church, and to have a school of His Own beyond the Jews, as we see at present, would He be likely to send those who believe on Him unto the Jews, to learn? But under the name of the Scribes and Pharisees He intimated that there would be some in His Church who would say and not do; but, in the person of Moses He designated Himself. For Moses represented Him, and for this reason did he put a vail before him, when he was speaking to the people; because as long as they were in the law given up to carnal joys and pleasures, and looking for an earthly kingdom, a vail was put upon their face, that they should not see Christ in the Scriptures. For when the vail was taken away, after that the Lord had suffered, the secrets of the temple were discovered. Accordingly when He was hanging on the Cross, the vail of the temple was rent from the top even to the bottom;[fn-65-P6528_2751222:22-nf] and the Apostle Paul says expressly, \"But when thou shalt turn to Christ, the vail shall be taken away.\"[fn-65-P6529_2751349:23-nf] Whereas with him who turneth not to Christ, though he read the law of Moses, the vail is laid upon his heart, as the Apostle says. When the Lord then would signify beforehand that there would be some such in His Church, what did He say? \"The Scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses' seat.

But I will descend even to this point of contest now, making a separation between the doctrine of apostles and their power. Discipline governs a man, power sets a seal upon him; apart from the fact that power is the Spirit, but the Spirit is God. What, moreover, used (the Spirit) to teach? That there must be no communicating with the works of darkness.[fn-16-P1632_482253:266-nf] Observe what He bids. Who, moreover, was able to forgive sins? This is His alone prerogative: for \"who remitteth sins but God alone? \"[fn-16-P1633_482429:267-nf] and, of course, (who but He can remit) mortal sins, such as have been committed against Himself,[fn-16-P1634_482557:268-nf] and against His temple? For, as far as you are concerned, such as are chargeable with offence against you personally, you are commanded, in the person of Peter, to forgive even seventy times sevenfold.[fn-16-P1635_482802:269-nf] And so, if it were agreed that even the blessed apostles had granted any such indulgence (to any crime) the pardon of which (comes) from God, not from man, it would be competent (for them) to have done so, not in the exercise of discipline, but of power. For they both raised the dead,[fn-16-P1636_483112:270-nf] which God alone (can do), and restored the debilitated to their integrity,[fn-16-P1637_483226:271-nf] which none but Christ (can do); nay, they inflicted plagues too, which Christ would not do. For it did not beseem Him to be severe who had come to suffer. Smitten were both Ananias[fn-16-P1638_483447:272-nf] and Elymas[fn-16-P1639_483478:273-nf] -Ananias with death, Elymas with blindness-in order that by this very fact it might be proved that Christ had had the power of doing even such (miracles). So, too, had the prophets (of old) granted to the repentant the pardon of murder, and therewith of adultery, inasmuch as they gave, at the same time, manifest proofs of seventy.[fn-16-P1640_483835:274-nf] Exhibit therefore even now to me,[fn-16-P1641_483905:275-nf] apostolic sir, prophetic evidences, that I may recognise your divine virtue, and vindicate to yourself the power of remitting such sins!

Their object in such a malignant perversion of the true doctrine, is to show that the less exalted statements, which our Lord utters in tits humanity, are to be thought to have issued from the Godhead Itself, that so they may show their blasphemy to have a stronger case, if it is upheld by the actual acknowledgment of the Lord. For this reason it is that Eunomius says, \"He who in the last days became man did not take upon Himself the man made up of soul and body.\" But, after searching through all the inspired and sacred Scripture, I do not find any such statement as this, that the Creator of all things, at the time of His ministration here on earth for man, took upon Himself flesh only without a soul. Under stress of necessity, then, looking to the object contemplated by the plan of salvation, to the doctrines of the Fathers, and to the inspired Scriptures, I will endeavour to confute the impious falsehood which is being fabricated with regard to this matter. The Lord came \"to seek and to save that which was lost[fn-12-P1204_656584:193-nf] .\" Now it was not the body merely, but the whole man, compacted of soul and body, that was lost: indeed, if we are to speak more exactly, the soul was lost sooner than the body. For disobedience is a sin, not of the body, but of the will: and the will properly belongs to the soul, from which the whole disaster of our nature bad its beginning, as the threat of God, that admits of no falsehood, testifies in the declaration that, in the day that they should eat of the forbidden fruit, death without respite would attach to the act. Now since the condemnation of man was twofold, death correspondingly effects in each part of our nature the deprivation of the twofold life that operates in him who is thus mortally stricken. For the death of the body consists in the extinction of the means of sensible perception, and in the dissolution of the body into its kindred elements: but \"the soul that sinneth,\" he saith, \"it shall die[fn-12-P1205_657543:194-nf] .\" Now sin is nothing else than alienation from God, Who is the true and only life. Accordingly the first man lived many hundred years after his disobedience, and yet God lied not when He said, \"In the day that ye eat thereof ye shall surely die[fn-12-P1206_657814:195-nf] .\" For by the fact of his alienation from the true life, the sentence of death was ratified against him that self-same day: and after this, at a much later time, there followed also the bodily death of Adam. He therefore Who came for this cause that He might seek and save that which was lost, (that which the shepherd in the parable calls the sheep,) both finds that which is lost, and carries home on His shoulders the whole sheep, not its skin only, that He may make the man of God complete, united to the deity in body and in soul. And thus He Who was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin, left no part of our nature which He did not take upon Himself. Now the soul is not sin though it is capable of admitting sin into it as the result of being ill-advised: and this He sanctifies by union with Himself for this end, that so the lump may be holy along with the first-fruits. Wherefore also the Angel, when informing Joseph of the destruction of the enemies of the Lord, said, \"They are dead which sought the young Child's life[fn-12-P1207_658887:196-nf] ,\" (or \"soul\"): and the Lord says to the Jews, \"Ye seek to kill Me, a man that hath told you the truth[fn-12-P1208_659073:197-nf] .\" Now by \"Man\" is not meant the body of a man only, but that which is composed of both, soul and body.

John, by liberating the soul also from its own malady after He had given health to the body, where He saith, \"Thou art made whole, sin no more[fn-12-P1211_659932:200-nf] ,\" thou, that is, who hast been cured in both, I mean in soul and in body. For so too does S. Paul speak, \"for to make in Himself of twain one new man[fn-12-P1212_660105:201-nf] .\" And so too He foretells that at the time of His Passion He would voluntarily detach His soul from His body, saying, \"No man taketh\" my soul \"from Me, but I lay it down of Myself: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again[fn-12-P1213_660370:202-nf] .\" Yea, the prophet David also, according to the interpretation of the great Peter, said with foresight of Him, \"Thou wilt not leave My soul in hell, neither wilt Thou suffer Thine Holy One to see corruption[fn-12-P1214_660678:203-nf] ,\" while the Apostle Peter thus expounds the saying, that \"His soul was not left in hell, neither His flesh did see corruption.\" For His Godhead, alike before taking flesh and in the flesh and after His Passion, is immutably the same, being at all times what It was by nature, and so continuing for ever. But in the suffering of His human nature the Godhead fulfilled the dispensation for our benefit by severing the soul for a season from the body, yet without being Itself separated from either of those elements to which it was once for all united, and by joining again the elements which had been thus parted, so as to give to all human nature a beginning and an example which it should follow of the resurrection from the dead, that all the corruptible may put on incorruption, and all the mortal may put on immortality, our first-fruits having been transformed to the Divine nature by its union with God, as Peter said, \"This same Jesus Whom ye crucified, hath God made both Lord and Christ[fn-12-P1215_661720:204-nf] ;\" and we might cite many passages of Scripture to support such a position, showing how the Lord, reconciling the world to Himself by the Humanity of Christ, apportioned His work of benevolence to men between His soul and His body, willing through His soul and touching them through His body.

To answer for ourselves in the first place, while we consider it no longer a duty to offer sacrifices, we recognize sacrifices as part of the mysteries of Revelation, by which the things prophesied were foreshadowed. For they were our examples, and in many and various ways they all pointed to the one sacrifice which we now commemorate. Now that this sacrifice has been revealed, and has been offered in due time, sacrifice is no longer binding as an act of worship, while it retains its symbolical authority. For these things \"were written for our learning, upon whom the end of the world is come.\"[fn-12-P1268_667164:7-nf] What you object to in sacrifice is the slaughter of animals, though the whole animal creation is intended conditionally in some way for the use of man. You are merciful to beasts, believing them to contain the souls of human beings, while you refuse a piece of bread to a hungry beggar. The Lord Jesus, on the other hand, was cruel to the swine when He granted the request of the devils to be allowed to enter into them.[fn-12-P1269_667603:8-nf] The same Lord Jesus, before the sacrifice of His passion, said to a leper whom He had cured, \"Go, show thyself to the priest, and give the offering, as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.\"[fn-12-P1270_667819:9-nf] When God, by the prophets, repeatedly declares that He needs no offering, as indeed reason teaches us that offerings cannot be needed by Him who stands in need of nothing, the human mind is led to inquire what God wished to teach us by these sacrifices. For, assuredly, He would not have required offerings of which He had no need. except to teach us something that it would profit us to know, and which was suitably set forth by means of these symbols. How much better and more honorable it would be for you to be still bound by these sacrifices, which have an instructive meaning, though they are not now necessary, than to require your followers to offer to you as food what you believe to be living victims. The Apostle Paul says most appropriately of some who preached the gospel to gratify their appetite, that their \"god was their belly.\"[fn-12-P1271_668681:10-nf] But the arrogance of your impiety goes much beyond this; for, instead of making your belly your god, you do what is far worse in making your belly the purifier of God. Surely it is great madness to make a pretence of piety in not slaughtering animals, while you hold that the souls of animals inhabit all the food you eat, and yet make what you call living creatures suffer such torture from your hands and teeth.","title":"Book VI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_21_book_xv_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"57","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"17. But let us now speak of those things of which we think as known, and have in our knowledge even if we do not think of them; whether they belong to the contemplative knowledge, which, as I have argued, is properly to be called wisdom, or to the active which is properly to be called knowledge. For both together belong to one mind, and are one image of God. But when we treat of the lower of the two distinctly and separately, then it is not to be called an image of God, although even then, too, some likeness of that Trinity may be found in it; as we showed in the thirteenth book. We speak now, therefore, of the entire knowledge of man altogether, in which whatever is known to us is known; that, at any rate, which is true; otherwise it would not be known. For no one knows what is false, except when he knows it to be false; and if he knows this, then he knows what is true: for it is true that that is false. We treat, therefore, now of those things which we think as known, and which are known to us even if they are not being thought of But certainly, if we would utter them in words, we can only do so by thinking them. For although there were no words spoken, at any rate, he who thinks speaks in his heart. And hence that passage in the book of Wisdom: \"They said within themselves, thinking not aright.\"[fn-19-P1971_992857:36-nf] For the words, \"They said within themselves,\" are explained by the addition of \"thinking.\" A like passage to this is that in the Gospel,-that certain scribes, when they heard the Lord's words to the paralytic man, \"Be of good cheer, my son, thy sins are forgiven thee,\" said within themselves, \"This man blasphemeth.\" For how did they \"say within themselves,\" except by thinking? Then follows, \"And when Jesus saw their thoughts, He said, Why think ye evil in your thoughts?\"[fn-19-P1972_993351:37-nf] So far Matthew. But Luke narrates the same thing thus: \"The scribes and Pharisees began to think, saying, Who is this that speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone? But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, He, answering, said unto them, What think ye in your hearts?\"[fn-19-P1973_993655:38-nf] That which in the book of Wisdom is, \"They said, thinking,\" is the same here with, \"They thought, saying.\" For both there and here it is declared, that they spake within themselves, and in their own heart, i.e. spake by thinking. For they \"spake within themselves,\" and it was said to them, \"What think ye?\" And the Lord Himself says of that rich man whose ground brought forth plentifully, \"And he thought within himself, saying.\"[fn-19-P1974_994108:39-nf] ","title":"Book XV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":39,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_24_the_prescription_against_heretics_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"64","folder":"ANF-03","text":"\"They have,\" says He, \"Moses and Elias,\"[fn-32-P3239_1154235:87-nf] -in other words, the law and the prophets, which preach Christ; as also in another place He says plainly, \"Search the Scriptures, in which ye expect (to find) salvation; for they testify of me; \"[fn-32-P3240_1154448:88-nf] which will be the meaning of \"Seek, and ye shall find.\" For it is clear that the next words also apply to the Jews: \"Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.\"[fn-32-P3241_1154623:89-nf] The Jews had formerly been in covenant with[fn-32-P3242_1154686:90-nf] God; but being afterwards cast off on account of their sins, they began to be[fn-32-P3243_1154776:91-nf] without God. The Gentiles, on the contrary, had never been in covenant with God; they were only as \"a drop from a bucket,\" and \"as dust from the threshing floor,[fn-32-P3244_1154974:92-nf] and were ever outside the door. Now, how shall he who was always outside knock at the place where he never was? What door does he know of, when he has passed through none, either by entrance or ejection? Is it not rather he who is aware that he once lived within and was thrust out, that (probably) found the door and knocked thereat?

Therefore it was to Israel that he spake when He said, \"I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\"[fn-32-P3247_1155765:95-nf] Not yet had He \"cast to the dogs the children's bread; \"[fn-32-P3248_1155841:96-nf] not yet did He charge them to \"go into the way of the Gentiles.\"[fn-32-P3249_1155920:97-nf] It is only at the last that He instructs them to \"go and teach all nations, and baptize them,\"[fn-32-P3250_1156032:98-nf] when they were so soon to receive \"the Holy Ghost, the Comforter, who should guide them into all the truth.\"[fn-32-P3251_1156164:99-nf] And this, too, makes towards the the same conclusion. If the apostles, who were ordained[fn-32-P3252_1156273:100-nf] to be teachers to the Gentiles, were themselves to have the Comforter for their teacher, far more needless[fn-32-P3253_1156398:101-nf] was it to say to us, \"Seek, and ye shall find,\" to whom was to come, without research,[fn-32-P3254_1156513:102-nf] our instruction[fn-32-P3255_1156543:103-nf] by the apostles, and to the apostles themselves by the Holy Ghost.

Then at last they left their boats, and followed Him, understanding that it was He who had begun to accomplish what He had declared. It is quite another case, when he affected to choose from the college of shipmasters, intending one day to appoint the shipmaster Marcion his apostle. We have indeed already laid it down, in opposition to his Antitheses, that the position of Marcion derives no advantage from the diversity which he supposes to exist between the Law and the Gospel, inasmuch as even this was ordained by the Creator, and indeed predicted in the promise of the new Law, and the new Word, and the new Testament. Since, however, he quotes with especial care,[fn-54-P5495_1691419:234-nf] as a proof in his domain,[fn-54-P5496_1691476:235-nf] a certain companion in misery (suntalai/pwron), and associate in hatred (summisou/menon), with himself, for the cure of leprosy,[fn-54-P5497_1691643:236-nf] I shall not be sorry to meet him, and before anything else to point out to him the force of the law figuratively interpreted, which, in this example of a leper (who was not to be touched, but was rather to be removed from all intercourse with others), prohibited any communication with a person who was defiled with sins, with whom the apostle also forbids us even to eat food,[fn-54-P5498_1692043:237-nf] forasmuch as the taint of sins would be communicated as if contagious: wherever a man should mix himself with the sinner. The Lord, therefore, wishing that the law should be more profoundly understood as signifying spiritual truths by carnal facts[fn-54-P5499_1692312:238-nf] -and thus[fn-55-P5500_1692363:239-nf] not destroying, but rather building up, that law which He wanted to have more earnestly acknowledged-touched the leper, by whom (even although as man He might have been defiled) He could not be defiled as God, being of course incorruptible. The prescription, therefore, could not be meant for Him, that He was bound to observe the law and not touch the unclean person, seeing that contact with the unclean would not cause defilement to Him. I thus teach that this (immunity) is consistent in my Christ, the rather when I show that it is not consistent in yours. Now, if it was as an enemy[fn-55-P5501_1692972:240-nf] of the law that He touched the leper-disregarding the precept of the law by a contempt of the defilement-how could he be defiled, when he possessed not a body[fn-55-P5502_1693147:241-nf] which could be defiled? For a phantom is not susceptible of defilement. He therefore, who could not be defiled, as being a phantom, will not have an immunity from pollution by any divine power, but owing to his fantastic vacuity; nor can he be regarded as having despised pollution, who had not in fact any material capacity[fn-55-P5503_1693527:242-nf] for it; nor, in like manner, as having destroyed the law, who had escaped defilement from the occasion of his phantom nature, not from any display of virtue. If, however, the Creator's prophet Elisha cleansed Naaman the Syrian alone,[fn-55-P5504_1693778:243-nf] to the exclusion of[fn-55-P5505_1693813:244-nf] so many lepers in Israel,[fn-55-P5506_1693890:245-nf] this fact contributes nothing to the distinction of Christ, as if he were in this way the better one for cleansing this Israelite leper, although a stranger to him, whom his own Lord had been unable to cleanse. The cleansing of the Syrian rather[fn-55-P5507_1694185:246-nf] was significant throughout the nations of the world[fn-55-P5508_1694280:247-nf] of their own cleansing in Christ their light,[fn-55-P5509_1694611:248-nf] steeped as they were in the stains of the seven deadly sins:[fn-55-P5510_1694770:249-nf] idolatry, blasphemy, murder, adultery, fornication, false-witness, and fraud.[fn-55-P5511_1694876:250-nf] Seven times, therefore, as if once for each,[fn-55-P5512_1696020:251-nf] did he wash in Jordan; both in order that he might celebrate the expiation of a perfect hebdomad;[fn-55-P5513_1696153:252-nf] and because the virtue and fulness of the one baptism was thus solemnly imputed[fn-55-P5514_1696293:253-nf] to Christ, alone, who was one day to establish on earth not only a revelation, but also a baptism, endued with compendious efficacy.[fn-55-P5515_1696444:254-nf] Even Marcion finds here an antithesis:[fn-55-P5516_1696636:255-nf] how that Elisha indeed required a material resource, applied water, and that seven times; whereas Christ, by the employment of a word only, and that but once for all, instantly effected[fn-55-P5517_1696845:256-nf] the cure. And surely I might venture[fn-55-P5518_1696905:257-nf] to claim[fn-55-P5519_1696939:258-nf] the Very Word also as of the Creator's substance. There is nothing of which He who was the primitive Author is not also the more powerful one. Forsooth,[fn-55-P5520_1697113:259-nf] it is incredible that that power of the Creator should have, by a word, produced a remedy for a single malady, which once by a word brought into being so vast a fabric as the world! From what can the Christ of the Creator be better discerned, than from the power of His word? But Christ is on this account another (Christ), because He acted differently from Elisha-because, in fact, the master is more powerful than his servant! Why, Marcion, do you lay down the rule, that things are done by servants just as they are by their very masters? Are you not afraid that it will turn to your discredit, if you deny that Christ belongs to the Creator, on the ground that He was once more powerful than a servant of the Creator-since, in comparison with the weakness of Elisha, He is acknowledged to be the greater, if indeed greater![fn-55-P5521_1697999:260-nf] For the cure is the same, although there is a difference in the working of it. What has your Christ performed more than my Elisha? Nay, what great thing has the word of your Christ performed, when it has simply done that which a river of the Creator effected? On the same principle occurs all the rest. So far as renouncing all human glory went, He forbade the man to publish abroad the cure; but so far as the honour of the law was concerned, He requested that the usual course should be followed: \"Go, show thyself to the priest, and present the offering which Moses commanded.\"[fn-55-P5522_1698604:261-nf] For the figurative signs of the law in its types He still would have observed, because of their prophetic import.[fn-55-P5523_1698737:262-nf] These types signified that a man, once a sinner, but afterwards purified[fn-55-P5524_1698836:263-nf] from the stains thereof by the word of God, was bound to offer unto God in the temple a gift, even prayer and thanksgiving in the church through Christ Jesus, who is the Catholic Priest of the Father.[fn-55-P5525_1699056:264-nf] Accordingly He added: \"that it may be for a testimony unto you\"-one, no doubt, whereby He would testify that He was not destroying the law, but fulfilling it; whereby, too, He would testify that it was He Himself who was foretold as about to undertake[fn-55-P5526_1699421:265-nf] their sicknesses and infirmities. This very consistent and becoming explanation of \"the testimony,\" that adulator of his own Christ, Marcion seeks to exclude under the cover of mercy and gentleness. For, being both good (such are his words), and knowing, besides, that every man who had been freed from leprosy would be sure to perform the solemnities of the law, therefore He gave this precept. Well, what then? Has He continued in his goodness (that is to say, in his permission of the law) or not? For if he has persevered in his goodness, he will never become a destroyer of the law; nor will he ever be accounted as belonging to another god, because there would not exist that destruction of the law which would constitute his claim to belong to the other god. If, however, he has not continued good, by a subsequent destruction of the law, it is a false testimony which he has since imposed upon them in his cure of the leper; because he has forsaken his goodness, in destroying the law. If, therefore, he was good whilst upholding the law,[fn-55-P5527_1700511:266-nf] he has now become evil as a destroyer of the law. However, by the support which he gave to the law, he affirmed that the law was good. For no one permits himself in the support of an evil thing. Therefore he is not only bad if he has permitted obedience to a bad law; but even worse still, if he has appeared[fn-55-P5528_1700843:267-nf] as the destroyer of a good law. So that if he commanded the offering of the gift because he knew that every cured leper would be sure to bring one; he possibly abstained from commanding what he knew would be spontaneously done. In vain, therefore, was his coming down, as if with the intention of destroying the law, when he makes concessions to the keepers of the law. And yet,[fn-55-P5529_1701238:268-nf] because he knew their disposition,[fn-55-P5530_1701288:269-nf] he ought the more earnestly to have prevented their neglect of the law,[fn-55-P5531_1701375:270-nf] since he had come for this purpose. Why then did he not keep silent, that man might of his own simple will obey the law? For then might he have seemed to some extent[fn-55-P5532_1701566:271-nf] to have persisted in his patience. But he adds also his own authority increased by the weight of this \"testimony.\" Of what testimony, I ask,[fn-55-P5533_1701727:272-nf] if not that of the assertion of the law? Surely it matters not in what way he asserted the law-whether as good, or as supererogatory,[fn-55-P5534_1701873:273-nf] or as patient, or as inconstant-provided, Marcion, I drive you from your position.[fn-55-P5535_1701976:274-nf] Observe,[fn-55-P5536_1701999:275-nf] he commanded that the law should be fulfilled. In whatever way he commanded it, in the same way might he also have first uttered that sentiment:[fn-55-P5537_1702157:276-nf] \"I came not to destroy the law, but to fulfil it.\"[fn-55-P5538_1702227:277-nf] What business, therefore, had you to erase out of the Gospel that which was quite consistent in it?[fn-55-P5539_1702347:278-nf] For you have confessed that, in his goodness, he did in act what you deny that he did in word.[fn-55-P5540_1702466:279-nf] We have therefore good proof that He uttered the word, in the fact that He did the deed; and that you have rather expunged the Lord's word, than that our (evangelists)[fn-55-P5541_1702823:280-nf] have inserted it.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":12,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"66","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Out of so many kinds of occupations, why indeed had He such respect for that of fishermen, as to select from it for apostles Simon and the sons of Zebedee (for it cannot seem to be the mere fact itself for which the narrative was meant to be drawn out[fn-54-P5492_1690334:231-nf] ), saying to Peter, when he trembled at the very large draught of the fishes, \"Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men? \"[fn-54-P5493_1690499:232-nf] By saying this, He suggested to them the meaning of the fulfilled prophecy, that it was even He who by Jeremiah had foretold, \"Behold, I will send many fishers; and they shall fish them,\"[fn-54-P5494_1690712:233-nf] that is, men. Then at last they left their boats, and followed Him, understanding that it was He who had begun to accomplish what He had declared. It is quite another case, when he affected to choose from the college of shipmasters, intending one day to appoint the shipmaster Marcion his apostle. We have indeed already laid it down, in opposition to his Antitheses, that the position of Marcion derives no advantage from the diversity which he supposes to exist between the Law and the Gospel, inasmuch as even this was ordained by the Creator, and indeed predicted in the promise of the new Law, and the new Word, and the new Testament. Since, however, he quotes with especial care,[fn-54-P5495_1691419:234-nf] as a proof in his domain,[fn-54-P5496_1691476:235-nf] a certain companion in misery (suntalai/pwron), and associate in hatred (summisou/menon), with himself, for the cure of leprosy,[fn-54-P5497_1691643:236-nf] I shall not be sorry to meet him, and before anything else to point out to him the force of the law figuratively interpreted, which, in this example of a leper (who was not to be touched, but was rather to be removed from all intercourse with others), prohibited any communication with a person who was defiled with sins, with whom the apostle also forbids us even to eat food,[fn-54-P5498_1692043:237-nf] forasmuch as the taint of sins would be communicated as if contagious: wherever a man should mix himself with the sinner. The Lord, therefore, wishing that the law should be more profoundly understood as signifying spiritual truths by carnal facts[fn-54-P5499_1692312:238-nf] -and thus[fn-55-P5500_1692363:239-nf] not destroying, but rather building up, that law which He wanted to have more earnestly acknowledged-touched the leper, by whom (even although as man He might have been defiled) He could not be defiled as God, being of course incorruptible. The prescription, therefore, could not be meant for Him, that He was bound to observe the law and not touch the unclean person, seeing that contact with the unclean would not cause defilement to Him. I thus teach that this (immunity) is consistent in my Christ, the rather when I show that it is not consistent in yours. Now, if it was as an enemy[fn-55-P5501_1692972:240-nf] of the law that He touched the leper-disregarding the precept of the law by a contempt of the defilement-how could he be defiled, when he possessed not a body[fn-55-P5502_1693147:241-nf] which could be defiled? For a phantom is not susceptible of defilement. He therefore, who could not be defiled, as being a phantom, will not have an immunity from pollution by any divine power, but owing to his fantastic vacuity; nor can he be regarded as having despised pollution, who had not in fact any material capacity[fn-55-P5503_1693527:242-nf] for it; nor, in like manner, as having destroyed the law, who had escaped defilement from the occasion of his phantom nature, not from any display of virtue. If, however, the Creator's prophet Elisha cleansed Naaman the Syrian alone,[fn-55-P5504_1693778:243-nf] to the exclusion of[fn-55-P5505_1693813:244-nf] so many lepers in Israel,[fn-55-P5506_1693890:245-nf] this fact contributes nothing to the distinction of Christ, as if he were in this way the better one for cleansing this Israelite leper, although a stranger to him, whom his own Lord had been unable to cleanse. The cleansing of the Syrian rather[fn-55-P5507_1694185:246-nf] was significant throughout the nations of the world[fn-55-P5508_1694280:247-nf] of their own cleansing in Christ their light,[fn-55-P5509_1694611:248-nf] steeped as they were in the stains of the seven deadly sins:[fn-55-P5510_1694770:249-nf] idolatry, blasphemy, murder, adultery, fornication, false-witness, and fraud.[fn-55-P5511_1694876:250-nf] Seven times, therefore, as if once for each,[fn-55-P5512_1696020:251-nf] did he wash in Jordan; both in order that he might celebrate the expiation of a perfect hebdomad;[fn-55-P5513_1696153:252-nf] and because the virtue and fulness of the one baptism was thus solemnly imputed[fn-55-P5514_1696293:253-nf] to Christ, alone, who was one day to establish on earth not only a revelation, but also a baptism, endued with compendious efficacy.[fn-55-P5515_1696444:254-nf] Even Marcion finds here an antithesis:[fn-55-P5516_1696636:255-nf] how that Elisha indeed required a material resource, applied water, and that seven times; whereas Christ, by the employment of a word only, and that but once for all, instantly effected[fn-55-P5517_1696845:256-nf] the cure. And surely I might venture[fn-55-P5518_1696905:257-nf] to claim[fn-55-P5519_1696939:258-nf] the Very Word also as of the Creator's substance. There is nothing of which He who was the primitive Author is not also the more powerful one. Forsooth,[fn-55-P5520_1697113:259-nf] it is incredible that that power of the Creator should have, by a word, produced a remedy for a single malady, which once by a word brought into being so vast a fabric as the world! From what can the Christ of the Creator be better discerned, than from the power of His word? But Christ is on this account another (Christ), because He acted differently from Elisha-because, in fact, the master is more powerful than his servant! Why, Marcion, do you lay down the rule, that things are done by servants just as they are by their very masters? Are you not afraid that it will turn to your discredit, if you deny that Christ belongs to the Creator, on the ground that He was once more powerful than a servant of the Creator-since, in comparison with the weakness of Elisha, He is acknowledged to be the greater, if indeed greater![fn-55-P5521_1697999:260-nf] For the cure is the same, although there is a difference in the working of it. What has your Christ performed more than my Elisha? Nay, what great thing has the word of your Christ performed, when it has simply done that which a river of the Creator effected? On the same principle occurs all the rest. So far as renouncing all human glory went, He forbade the man to publish abroad the cure; but so far as the honour of the law was concerned, He requested that the usual course should be followed: \"Go, show thyself to the priest, and present the offering which Moses commanded.\"[fn-55-P5522_1698604:261-nf] For the figurative signs of the law in its types He still would have observed, because of their prophetic import.[fn-55-P5523_1698737:262-nf] These types signified that a man, once a sinner, but afterwards purified[fn-55-P5524_1698836:263-nf] from the stains thereof by the word of God, was bound to offer unto God in the temple a gift, even prayer and thanksgiving in the church through Christ Jesus, who is the Catholic Priest of the Father.[fn-55-P5525_1699056:264-nf] Accordingly He added: \"that it may be for a testimony unto you\"-one, no doubt, whereby He would testify that He was not destroying the law, but fulfilling it; whereby, too, He would testify that it was He Himself who was foretold as about to undertake[fn-55-P5526_1699421:265-nf] their sicknesses and infirmities.

Therefore he is not only bad if he has permitted obedience to a bad law; but even worse still, if he has appeared[fn-55-P5528_1700843:267-nf] as the destroyer of a good law. So that if he commanded the offering of the gift because he knew that every cured leper would be sure to bring one; he possibly abstained from commanding what he knew would be spontaneously done.

Concerning the forgiveness of sins, Micah also says: \"Who is a God like unto Thee? pardoning iniquity, and passing by the transgressions of the remnant of Thine heritage. He retaineth not His anger as a testimony against them, because He delighteth in mercy. He will turn again, and will have compassion upon us; He wipeth away our iniquities, and casteth our sins into the depths of the sea.\"[fn-55-P5552_1705036:288-nf] Now, if nothing of this sort had been predicted of Christ, I should find in the Creator examples of such a benignity as would hold out to me the promise of similar affections also in the Son of whom He is the Father. I see how the Ninevites obtained forgiveness of their sins from the Creator[fn-55-P5553_1705354:289-nf] -not to say from Christ, even then, because from the beginning He acted in the Father's name. I read, too, how that, when David acknowledged his sin against Uriah, the prophet Nathan said unto him, \"The Lord hath cancelled[fn-55-P5554_1705599:290-nf] thy sin, and thou shalt not die; \"[fn-55-P5555_1705654:291-nf] how king Ahab in like manner, the husband of Jezebel, guilty of idolatry and of the blood of Naboth, obtained pardon because of his repentance;[fn-55-P5556_1705821:292-nf] and how Jonathan the son of Saul blotted out by his deprecation the guilt of a violated fast.[fn-55-P5557_1705939:293-nf] Why should I recount the frequent restoration of the nation itself after the forgiveness of their sins?-by that God, indeed, who will have mercy rather than sacrifice, and a sinner's repentance rather than his death.[fn-55-P5558_1706205:294-nf] You will first have to deny that the Creator ever forgave sins; then you must in reason show[fn-55-P5559_1706323:295-nf] that He never ordained any such prerogative for His Christ; and so you will prove how novel is that boasted[fn-55-P5560_1706466:296-nf] benevolence of the, of course, novel Christ when you shall have proved that it is neither compatible with[fn-55-P5561_1706586:297-nf] the Creator nor predicted by the Creator. But whether to remit sins can appertain to one who is said to be unable to retain them, and whether to absolve can belong to him who is incompetent even to condemn, and whether to forgive is suitable to him against whom no offence can be committed, are questions which we have encountered elsewhere,[fn-55-P5562_1706942:298-nf] when we preferred to drop suggestions[fn-55-P5563_1707019:299-nf] rather than treat them anew.[fn-55-P5564_1707065:300-nf] Concerning the Son of man our rule[fn-55-P5565_1707151:301-nf] is a twofold one: that Christ cannot lie, so as to declare Himself the Son of man, if He be not truly so; nor can He be constituted the Son of man, unless He be born of a human parent, either father or mother. And then the discussion will turn on the point, of which human parent He ought to be accounted the son-of the father or the mother? Since He is (begotten) of God the Father, He is not, of course, (the son) of a human father. If He is not of a human father, it follows that He must be (the son) of a human mother. If of a human mother, it is evident that she must be a virgin. For to whom a human father is not ascribed, to his mother a husband will not be reckoned; and then to what mother a husband is not reckoned, the condition of virginity belongs.[fn-55-P5566_1707935:302-nf] But if His mother be not a virgin, two fathers will have to be reckoned to Him-a divine and a human one. For she must have a husband, not to be a virgin; and by having a husband, she would cause two fathers-one divine, the other human-to accrue to Him, who would thus be Son both of God and of a man. Such a nativity (if one may call it so)[fn-55-P5567_1708398:303-nf] the mythic stories assign to Castor or to Hercules. Now, if this distinction be observed, that is to say, if He be Son of man as born of His mother, because not begotten of a father, and His mother be a virgin, because His father is not human-He will be that Christ whom Isaiah foretold that a virgin should conceive,[fn-55-P5568_1708733:304-nf] On what principle you, Marcion, can admit Him Son of man, I cannot possibly see. If through a human father, then you deny him to be Son of God; if through a divine one also,[fn-55-P5569_1708929:305-nf] then you make Christ the Hercules of fable; if through a human mother only, then you concede my point; if not through a human father also,[fn-55-P5570_1709086:306-nf] then He is not the son of any man,[fn-55-P5571_1709145:307-nf] and He must have been guilty of a lie for having declared Himself to be what He was not. One thing alone can help you in your difficulty: boldness on your part either to surname your God as actually the human father of Christ, as Valentinus did[fn-55-P5572_1709445:308-nf] with his ¦on; or else to deny that the Virgin was human, which even Valentinus did not do. What now, if Christ be described[fn-55-P5573_1709634:309-nf] in Daniel by this very title of \"Son of man? \"Is not this enough to prove that He is the Christ of prophecy? For if He gives Himself that appellation which was provided in the prophecy for the Christ of the Creator, He undoubtedly offers Himself to be understood as Him to whom (the appellation) was assigned by the prophet. But perhaps[fn-55-P5574_1709989:310-nf] it can be regarded as a simple identity of names;[fn-55-P5575_1710056:311-nf] and yet we have maintained[fn-55-P5576_1710116:312-nf] that neither Christ nor Jesus ought to have been called by these names, if they possessed any condition of diversity. But as regards the appellation \"Son of man,\" in as far as it Occurs by accident,[fn-55-P5577_1710370:313-nf] in so far there is a difficulty in its occurrence along with[fn-55-P5578_1710461:314-nf] a casual identity of names. For it is of pure[fn-55-P5579_1710521:315-nf] accident, especially when the same cause does not appear[fn-55-P5580_1710594:316-nf] whereby the identity may be occasioned. And therefore, if Marcion's Christ be also said to be born of man, then he too would receive an identical appellation, and there would be two Sons of man, as also two Christs and two Jesuses. Therefore, since the appellation is the sole right of Him in whom it has a suitable reason,[fn-55-P5581_1710939:317-nf] if it be claimed for another in whom there is an identity of name, but not of appellation,[fn-55-P5582_1711045:318-nf] then the identity of name even looks suspicious in him for whom is claimed without reason the identity of appellation. And it follows that He must be believed to be One and the Same, who is found to be the more fit to receive both the name and the appellation; while the other is excluded, who has no right to the appellation, because he has no reason to show for it. Nor will any other be better entitled to both than He who is the earlier, and has had allotted to Him the name of Christ and the appellation of Son of man, even the Jesus of the Creator. It was He who was seen by the king of Babylon in the furnace with His martyrs: \"the fourth, who was like the Son of man.\"[fn-55-P5583_1711884:319-nf] He also was revealed to Daniel himself expressly as \"the Son of man, coming in the clouds of heaven\" as a Judge, as also the Scripture shows.[fn-55-P5584_1712047:320-nf] What I have advanced might have been sufficient concerning the designation in prophecy of the Son of man. But the Scripture offers me further information, even in the interpretation of the Lord Himself. For when the Jews, who looked at Him as merely man, and were not yet sure that He was God also, as being likewise the Son of God, rightly enough said that a man could not forgive sins, but God alone, why did He not, following up their point[fn-55-P5585_1712512:321-nf] about man, answer them, that He[fn-55-P5586_1712579:322-nf] had power to remit sins; inasmuch as, when He mentioned the Son of man, He also named a human being? except it were because He wanted, by help of the very designation \"Son of man\" from the book of Daniel, so to induce them to reflect[fn-55-P5587_1712839:323-nf] as to show them that He who remitted sins was God and man-that only Son of man, indeed, in the prophecy of Daniel, who had obtained the power of judging, and thereby, of course, of forgiving sins likewise (for He who judges also absolves); so that, when once that objection of theirs[fn-55-P5588_1713143:324-nf] was shattered to pieces by their recollection of Scripture, they might the more easily acknowledge Him to be the Son of man Himself by His own actual forgiveness of sins. I make one more observation,[fn-55-P5589_1713365:325-nf] how that He has nowhere as yet professed Himself to be the Son of God-but for the first time in this passage, in which for the first time He has remitted sins; that is, in which for the first time He has used His function of judgment, by the absolution. All that the opposite side has to allege in argument against these things, (I beg you) carefully weigh[fn-55-P5590_1713738:326-nf] what it amounts to. For it must needs strain itself to such a pitch of infatuation as, on the one hand, to maintain that (their Christ) is also Son of man, in order to save Him from the charge of falsehood; and, on the other hand, to deny that He was born of woman, lest they grant that He was the Virgin's son. Since, however, the divine authority and the nature of the case, and common sense, do not admit this insane position of the heretics, we have here the opportunity of putting in a veto[fn-55-P5591_1714251:327-nf] in the briefest possible terms, on the substance of Christ's body, against Marcion's phantoms. Since He is born of man, being the Son of man. He is body derived from body.[fn-55-P5592_1714445:328-nf] You may, I assure you,[fn-55-P5593_1714494:329-nf] more easily find a man born without a heart or without brains, like Marcion himself, than without a body, like Marcion's Christ. And let this be the limit to your examination of the heart, or, at any rate, the brains of the heretic of Pontus.[fn-55-P5594_1714780:330-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":27,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"70","folder":"ANF-03","text":"The publican who was chosen by the Lord,[fn-55-P5598_1715134:331-nf] he adduces for a proof that he was chosen as a stranger to the law and uninitiated in[fn-55-P5599_1715276:332-nf] Judaism, by one who was an adversary to the law.

For if there had been no ministry of John at all-\"the voice,\" as Isaiah calls him, \"of one crying in the wilderness,\" and the preparer of the ways of the Lord by denunciation and recommendation of repentance; if, too, he had not baptized (Christ) Himself[fn-56-P5608_1717844:341-nf] along with others, nobody could have challenged the disciples of Christ, as they ate and drank, to a comparison with the disciples of John, who were constantly fasting and praying; because, if there existed any diversity[fn-56-P5609_1718079:342-nf] between Christ and John, and their followers respectively, no exact comparison would be possible, nor would there be a single point where it could be challenged. For nobody would feel surprise, and nobody would be perplexed, although there should arise rival predictions of a diverse deity, which should also mutually differ about modes of conduct,[fn-56-P5610_1718582:343-nf] having a prior difference about the authorities[fn-56-P5611_1718680:344-nf] upon which they were based. Therefore Christ belonged to John, and John to Christ; while both belonged to the Creator, and both were of the law and the prophets, preachers and masters. Else Christ would have rejected the discipline of John, as of the rival god, and would also have defended the disciples, as very properly pursuing a different walk, because consecrated to the service of another and contrary deity. But as it is, while modestly[fn-56-P5612_1719184:345-nf] giving a reason why \"the children of the bridegroom are unable to fast during the time the bridegroom is with them,\" but promising that \"they should afterwards fast, when the bridegroom was taken away from them,\"[fn-56-P5613_1719416:346-nf] He neither defended the disciples, (but rather excused them, as if they had not been blamed without some reason), nor rejected the discipline of John, but rather allowed[fn-56-P5614_1719609:347-nf] it, referring it to the time of John, although destining it for His own time. Otherwise His purpose would have been to reject it,[fn-56-P5615_1719757:348-nf] and to defend its opponents, if He had not Himself already belonged to it as then in force. I hold also that it is my Christ who is meant by the bridegroom, of whom the psalm says: \"He is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber; His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and His return is back to the end of it again.\"[fn-56-P5616_1720111:349-nf] By the mouth of Isaiah He also says exultingly of the Father: \"Let my soul rejoice in the Lord; for He hath clothed me with the garment of salvation and with the tunic of joy, as a bridegroom. He hath put a mitre round about my head, as a bride.\"[fn-56-P5617_1720380:350-nf] To Himself likewise He appropriates[fn-56-P5618_1720437:351-nf] the church, concerning which the same[fn-56-P5619_1720491:352-nf] Spirit says to Him: \"Thou shall clothe Thee with them all, as with a bridal ornament.\"[fn-56-P5620_1720624:353-nf] This spouse Christ invites home to Himself also by Solomon from the call of the Gentiles, because you read: \"Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse.\"[fn-56-P5621_1720794:354-nf] He elegantly makes mention of Lebanon (the mountain, of course) because it stands for the name of frankincense with the Greeks;[fn-56-P5622_1720949:355-nf] for it was from idolatry that He betrothed Himself the church. Deny now, Marcion, your utter madness, (if you can)! Behold, you impugn even the law of your god. He unites not in the nuptial bond, nor, when contracted, does he allow it; no one does he baptize but a cµlebs or a eunuch; until death or divorce does he reserve baptism.[fn-56-P5623_1721531:356-nf] Wherefore, then, do you make his Christ a bridegroom? This is the designation of Him who united man and woman, not of him who separated them. You have erred also in that declaration of Christ, wherein He seems to make a difference between things new and old. You are inflated about the old bottles, and brain-muddled with the new wine; and therefore to the old (that is to say, to the prior) gospel you have sewed on the patch of your new-fangled heresy. I should like to know in what respect the Creator is inconsistent with Himself.[fn-56-P5624_1722155:357-nf] When by Jeremiah He gave this precept, \"Break up for yourselves new pastures,\"[fn-56-P5625_1722248:358-nf] does He not turn away from the old state of things? And when by Isaiah He proclaims how \"old things were passed away; and, behold, all things, which I am making, are new,\"[fn-56-P5626_1722439:359-nf] does He not advert to a new state of things? We have generally been of opinion[fn-56-P5627_1722587:360-nf] that the destination of the former state of things was rather promised by the Creator, and exhibited in reality by Christ, only under the authority of one and the same God, to whom appertain both the old things and the new. For new wine is not put into old bottles, except by one who has the old bottles; nor does anybody put a new piece to an old garment, unless the old garment be forthcoming to him. That person only[fn-56-P5628_1723030:361-nf] does not do a thing when it is not to be done, who has the materials wherewithal to do it if it were to be done. And therefore, since His object in making the comparison was to show that He was separating the new condition[fn-56-P5629_1723266:362-nf] of the gospel from the old state[fn-56-P5630_1723315:363-nf] of the law, He proved that that[fn-56-P5631_1723364:364-nf] from which He was separating His own ought not to have been branded[fn-56-P5632_1723474:365-nf] as a separation[fn-56-P5633_1723507:366-nf] of things which were alien to each other; for nobody ever unites his own things with things that are alien to them,[fn-56-P5634_1723685:367-nf] in order that he may afterwards be able to separate them from the alien things. A separation is possible by help of the conjunction through which it is made. Accordingly, the things which He separated He also proved to have been once one; as they would have remained, were it not for His separation. But still we make this concession, that there is a separation, by reformation, by amplification,[fn-56-P5635_1724126:368-nf] by progress; just as the fruit is separated from the seed, although the fruit comes from the seed. So likewise the gospel is separated from the law, whilst it advances[fn-56-P5636_1724315:369-nf] from the law-a different thing[fn-56-P5637_1724381:370-nf] from it, but not an alien one; diverse, but not contrary. Nor in Christ do we even find any novel form of discourse. Whether He proposes similitudes or refute questions, it comes from the seventy-seventh Psalm. \"I will open,\" says He, \"my mouth in a parable\" (that is, in a similitude); \"I will utter dark problems\" (that is, I will set forth questions).[fn-56-P5638_1724751:371-nf] If you should wish to prove that a man belonged to another race, no doubt you would fetch your proof from the idiom of his language.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":27,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"70","folder":"ANF-03","text":"The publican who was chosen by the Lord,[fn-55-P5598_1715134:331-nf] he adduces for a proof that he was chosen as a stranger to the law and uninitiated in[fn-55-P5599_1715276:332-nf] Judaism, by one who was an adversary to the law.

But the question may be asked, how He called the fishermen from their boats two by two, namely, calling Peter and Andrew first, and then going forward a little and calling other two, namely the sons of Zebedee, according to the narratives of Matthew and Mark; whereas Luke's version of the matter is, that both their boats were filled with the immense haul of fishes. And his statement bears further, that Peter's partners, to wit, James and John, the sons of Zebedee, were summoned to the men's help when they were unable to drag out their crowded nets, and that all who were there were astonished at the enormous draught of fishes which had been taken; and that when Jesus said to Peter, \"Fear not, from henceforth thou shall catch men,\"although the words had been addressed to Peter alone, they all nevertheless followed Him when they had brought their ships to land.[fn-16-P1601_655082:182-nf] Well, we are to understand by this, that what Luke introduces here was what took place first, and that these men were not called by the Lord on this occasion, but only that the prediction was uttered to Peter by himself, that he would be a fisher of men. That saying, moreover, was not intended to convey that they would never thereafter be catchers of fish. For we read that even after the Lord's resurrection they were engaged again in fishing.[fn-16-P1602_655550:183-nf] The words, therefore, imported simply that thereafter he would catch men, and they did not bear that henceforth he would not catch fish. And in this way we are at perfect liberty to suppose that they returned to the catching of fish, according to their habit; so that those incidents which are related by Matthew and Mark might easily take place at a period subsequent to this. I refer to what occurred at the time when He called the disciples two by two, and Himself gave them the command to follow Him, at first addressing Peter and Andrew, and then the others, namely, the two sons of Zebedee. For on that occasion they did not follow Him only after they had drawn up their ships on shore, as with the intention of returning to them, but they went after Him immediately, as after one who summoned and commanded them to follow Him.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"169","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"58. A difficulty, however, may certainly arise when we observe how Matthew tells the story of the paralytic after this fashion: \"And He entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into His own city. And, behold, they brought to Him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed;\" whereas Mark speaks of the incident as taking place not in His own city, which indeed is called Nazareth, but in Capharnaum. His narrative is to the following effect:-\" And again He entered into Capharnaum after some days; and it was noised that He was in the house. And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and He spake a word[fn-17-P1703_696503:251-nf] unto them. And they came unto Him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four. And when they could not come nigh unto Him for the press, they uncovered the roof where He was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay. And when Jesus saw their faith;\" and so forth.[fn-17-P1704_696908:252-nf] Luke, on the other hand, does not mention the place in which the incident happened, but gives the tale thus: \"And it came to pass on a certain day that He was sitting teaching,[fn-17-P1705_697107:253-nf] and there were Pharisees and doctors of the law also sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them. And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before Him. And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the house-top, and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus. And when He saw their faith, He said, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee;\" and so forth.[fn-17-P1706_697751:254-nf] The question, therefore, remains one between Mark and Matthew, in so far as Matthew writes of the incident as taking place in the Lord's city;[fn-17-P1707_697916:255-nf] while Mark locates it in Capharnaum. This question would be more difficult to solve if Matthew mentioned Nazareth by name. But, as the case stands, when we reflect that the state of Galilee itself might have been called Christ's city,[fn-17-P1708_698178:256-nf] because Nazareth was in Galilee, just as the whole region which was made up of so many cities[fn-17-P1709_698297:257-nf] is yet called a Roman state;[fn-17-P1710_698346:258-nf] when, further, it is considered that so many nations are comprehended in that city, of which it is written, \"Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God;\"[fn-17-P1711_698529:259-nf] and also that God's ancient people, though dwelling in so many cities, have yet been spoken of as one house, the house of Israel,[fn-17-P1712_698682:260-nf] -who can doubtthat [it may be fairly said that] Jesus wrought this work in His own city [or, state], inasmuch as He did it in the city of Capharnaum, which was a city of that Galilee to which He had returned when He crossed over again from the country of the Gerasenes, so that when He came into Galilee He might correctly be said to have come into His own city [or, state], in which ever town of Galilee He might happen to be? This explanation may be vindicated more particularly on the ground that Capharnaum itself held a position of such eminence in Galilee that it was reckoned to be a kind of metropolis. But even were it altogether illegitimate to take the city of Christ in the sense either of Galilee itself, in which Nazareth was situated, or of Capharnaum, which was distinguished as in a certain sense the capital of Galilee, we might still affirm that Matthew has simply passed over all that happened after Jesus came into His own city until He reached Capharnaum, and that he has simply tacked on the narrative of the healing of the paralytic at this point; just as the writers do in many instances, leaving unnoticed much that intervenes, and, without any express indication of the omissions they are making, proceeding precisely as if what they subjoin, followed actually in literal succession.[fn-17-P1713_700039:261-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":27,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"171","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"59. Matthew next continues his narrative in the following terms:-\" And as Jesus passed forth from thence, He saw a man named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and He saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed Him.\"[fn-17-P1717_700696:262-nf] Mark gives this story also, and keeps the same order, bringing it in after the notice of the healing of the man who was sick of the palsy. His version runs thus: \"And He went forth again by the sea-side; and all the multitude resorted unto Him, and He taught them. And as He passed by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed Him.\"[fn-17-P1718_701131:263-nf] There is no contradiction here; for Matthew is the same person with Levi. Luke also introduces this after the story of the healing of the same man who was sick of the palsy. He writes in these terms: \"And after these things He went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and He said unto him, Follow me. And he left all, rose up, and followed Him.\"[fn-17-P1719_701538:264-nf] Now, from this it will appear to be the most reasonable explanation to say that Matthew records these things here in the form of things previously passed over, and now brought to mind. For certainly we must believe that Matthew's calling took place before the delivery of the sermon on the mount. For Luke tells us that on this mountain on that occasion the election was made of all these twelve, whom Jesus also named apostles, out of the larger body of the disciples.[fn-17-P1720_702031:265-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":27,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":29,"source_paragraph":"173","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"60.

This might make it appear as if he had not appended this notice in its strict order here, but had introduced at this point, in the way of reminiscence, something which actually took place on a different occasion, were it not that Mark and Luke, who repeat the account in terms thoroughly similar, have made it plain that it was in the house of Levi-that is to say, Matthew-that Jesus sat at meat, and all these sayings were uttered which follow. For Mark states the same fact, keeping also the same order, in the following manner: \"And it came to pass, as He sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus.\"[fn-17-P1725_703737:267-nf] Accordingly, when he says, \"in his house,\" he certainly refers to the person of whom he was speaking directly before, and that was Levi.

For the fact is that Luke himself, no less than the others, represents the Lord as making the reply, and saying, \"I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\"[fn-17-P1732_705957:273-nf] And He would not have returned that answer to them, had not their words, \"Why do ye eat and drink?\" been directed very specially to Himself.

In the same way, we may subject what is said about the disciples of John to examination. Matthew's words are these: \"Then came to Him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft?\"[fn-17-P1735_708066:275-nf] The purport of Mark's version is similar: \"And the disciples of John and the Pharisees[fn-17-P1736_708174:276-nf] used to fast.[fn-17-P1737_708248:277-nf] And they come and say unto Him, Why do the disciples of John and the Pharisees[fn-17-P1738_708448:278-nf] fast, but thy disciples fast not?\"[fn-17-P1739_708504:279-nf] The only semblance of a discrepancy that can be found here, is in the possibility of supposing that the mention of the Pharisees as having spoken along with the disciples of John is an addition of Mark's, while Matthew states only that the disciples of John expressed themselves to the above effect. But the words which were actually uttered by the parties, according to Mark's version, rather indicate that the speakers and the persons spoken of were not the same individuals. I mean, that the persons who came to Jesus were the guests who were then present, that they came because the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting, and that they uttered the above words with respect to these parties. In this way, the evangelist's phrase, \"they come,\" would not refer to the persons regarding whom he had just thrown in the remark, \"And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting.\" But the case would be, that as those parties were fasting, some others here, who are moved by that fact, come to Him, and put this question to Him, \"Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?\" This is more clearly expressed by Luke. For, evidently with the same idea in his mind, after stating what answer the Lord returned in the words in which He spoke about the calling of sinners under the similitude of those who are sick, he proceeds thus: \"And they said unto Him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees, but thine eat and drink?\"[fn-17-P1740_710063:280-nf] Here, then, we see that, as was the case with Mark, Luke has mentioned one party as speaking to this intent in relation to other parties. How comes it, therefore, that Matthew says, \"Then came to Him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast?\" The explanation may be, that those individuals were also present, and that all these various parties were eager to advance this charge, as they severally found opportunity. And the sentiments which sought expression on this occasion have been conveyed by the three evangelists undervaried terms, but yet without any divergence from a true statement of the fact itself.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_25_book_iii_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"36","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"14.

He was brought as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb which is dumb before its shearer.\"[fn-31-P3185_535452:38-nf] Therefore we ought to be deeply grateful to the Lord, because He has both made known to us things that are past, and hath given us wisdom concerning things present, and hath not left us without understanding in regard to things which are to come.

Moreover, teaching Israel, and doing so great miracles and signs, He preached [the truth] to him, and greatly loved him. But when He chose His own apostles who where to preach His Gospel, [He did so from among those] who were sinners above all sin, that He might show He came \"not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\"[fn-31-P3188_537045:41-nf] Then He manifested Himself to be the Son of God.

The Son of God therefore came in the flesh with this view, that He might bring to a head the sum of their sins who had persecuted His prophets[fn-31-P3190_537571:43-nf] to the death. For this purpose, then, He endured.

That, however, is a parable in word, not one embodied in outward action; and just as in the passage before us the Lord indicated by an outward action the kind of character the Church would have in the end of the world, so in the same way, by that other fishing, He indicated its present character. In doing the one at the commencement of His preaching and this latter after His resurrection, He showed thereby in the former case that the capture of fishes signified the good and bad presently existing in the Church; but in the latter, the good only, whom it will contain everlastingly, when the resurrection of the dead shall have been completed in the end of this world. Furthermore, on that previous occasion Jesus stood not, as here, on the shore, when He gave orders for the taking of the fish, but \"entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land; and He sat down therein, and taught the crowds. And when He had left speaking, He said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.\" There also they put the fishes that were caught into the ship, and did not, as here, draw the net to the shore. By these signs, and any others that may be found, on the former occasion the Church was prefigured as it exists in this world, and on the other, as it shall be in the end of the world: the one accordingly took place before, and the other subsequently to the resurrection of the Lord; because there we were signified by Christ as called, and here as raised from the dead. On that occasion the nets are not let down on the right side, that the good alone might not be signified, nor on the left, test the application should be limited to the bad; but without any reference to either side, He says, \"Let down your nets for a draught,\" that we may understand the good and bad as mingled together: while on this He says, \"Cast the net on the right side of the ship,\" to signify those who stood on the right hand, the good alone. There the net was broken on account of the schisms that were meant to be signified; but here, as then there will be no more schisms in that supreme peace of the saints, the evangelist was entitled to say, \"And for all they were so great,\" that is, so large, \"yet was not the net broken;\" as if with reference to the previous time when it was broken, and a commendation of the good that was here in comparison with the evil that preceded. There the multitude of fishes caught was so great, that the two vessels were filled and began to sink,[fn-38-P3852_2119203:10-nf] that is, were weighed down to the point of sinking; for they did not actually sink, but were in extreme jeopardy. For whence exist in the Church the great evils under which we groan, save from the impossibility of withstanding the enormous multitude that, almost to the entire subversion of discipline, gain an entrance, with their morals so utterly at variance with the pathway of the saints? Here, however, they cast the net on the right side, \"and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.\" What is meant by the words, \"Now they were not able to draw it,\" but this, that those who belong to the resurrection of life, that is to say, to the right hand, and depart this life within the nets of the Christian name, will be made manifest only on the shore, in other words, when they shall rise from the dead at the end of the world? Accordingly, they were not able to draw the nets so as to discharge into the vessel the fishes they had caught, as was done with all of those wherewith the net was broken, and the boats laden to sinking. But the Church possesses those right-hand ones after the close of this life in the sleep of peace, lying hid as it were in the deep, till the net reach the shore whither it is being drawn, as it were two hundred cubits. And as on that first occasion it was done by two vessels, with reference to the circumcision and the uncircumcision; so in this place, by the two hundred cubits, I am of opinion that there is symbolized, with reference to the elect of both classes, the circumcision and the uncircumcision, as it were two separate hundreds; because the number that passes to the right hand is represented summarily by hundreds. And last of all, in that former fishing the number of fishes is not expressed, as if the words were there acted on that were uttered by the prophet, \"I have declared and spoken; they are multiplied beyond number:\"[fn-38-P3853_2121124:11-nf] while here there are none beyond calculation, but the definite number of a hundred and fifty and three; and of the reason of this number we must now, with the Lord's help, give some account.","title":"Tractate CXXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_41_the_treatise_concerning_widows_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"98","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"62.

And the other describes the Cherubic Chariot[fn-43-P4309_1334385:61-nf] of God, and the Throne upon them, and the Firmament over it, and Him that shewed Himself in the Firmament, and Voices, and Forces, and Deeds.[fn-43-P4310_1334547:62-nf] And whether this was an appearance by day, only visible to Saints, or an unerring vision of the night, or an impression on the mind holding converse with the future as if it were the present; or some other ineffable form of prophecy, I cannot say; the God of the Prophets knoweth, and they know who are thus inspired. But neither these of whom I am speaking, nor any of their fellows ever stood before the Council[fn-43-P4311_1334996:63-nf] and Essence of God, as it is written, or saw, or proclaimed the Nature of God.","title":"Oration XXVIII.","author":"Gregory Nazianzen"},{"chapter":5,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_55_book_i_","source_chapter":64,"source_paragraph":"204","folder":"ANF-04","text":"And since Celsus has termed the apostles of Jesus men of infamous notoriety, saying that they were tax-gatherers and sailors of the vilest character, we have to remark, with respect to this charge, that he seems, in order to bring an accusation against Christianity, to believe the Gospel accounts only where he pleases, and to express his disbelief of them, in order that he may not be forced to admit the manifestations of Divinity related in these same books; whereas one who sees the spirit of truth by which the writers are influenced, ought, from their narration of things of inferior importance, to believe also the account of divine things. Now in the general Epistle of Barnabas, from which perhaps Celsus took the statement that the apostles were notoriously wicked men, it is recorded that \"Jesus selected His own apostles, as persons who were more guilty of sin than all other evildoers.\"[fn-79-P7951_1924975:123-nf] And in the Gospel according to Luke, Peter says to Jesus, \"Depart from me, O Lord, for I am a sinful man.\"[fn-79-P7952_1925135:124-nf] Moreover, Paul, who himself also at a later time became an apostle of Jesus, says in his Epistle to Timothy, \"This is a faithful saying, that Jesus Christ came into, the world to save sinners, of whom I am the chief.\"[fn-79-P7953_1925372:125-nf] And I do not know how Celsus should have forgotten or not have thought of saying something about Paul, the founder, after Jesus, of the Churches that are in Christ. He saw, probably, that anything he might say about that apostle would require to be explained, in consistency with the fact that, after being a persecutor of the Church of God, and a bitter opponent of believers, who went so far even as to deliver over the disciples of Jesus to death, so great a change afterwards passed over him, that he preached the Gospel of Jesus from Jerusalem round about to Illyricum, and was ambitious to carry the glad tidings where he needed not to build upon another man's foundation, but to places where the Gospel of God in Christ had not been proclaimed at all. What absurdity, therefore, is there, if Jesus, desiring to manifest to the human race the power which He possesses to heal souls, should have selected notorious and wicked men, and should have raised them to such a degree of moral excellence, that they, became a pattern of the purest virtue to all who were converted by their instrumentality to the Gospel of Christ?","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":5,"verse":29,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_50_oration_xxxviii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"XIV. To this what have those cavillers to say, those bitter reasoners about Godhead, those detractors of all that is praiseworthy, those darkeners of light, uncultured in respect of wisdom, for whom Christ died in vain, those unthankful creatures, the work of the Evil One? Do you turn this benefit into a reproach to God? Wilt thou deem Him little on this account, that He humbled Himself for thee; because the Good Shepherd,[fn-49-P4922_1619002:34-nf] He who lays down His life for His sheep, came to seek for that which had strayed upon the mountains and the hills, on which thou wast then sacrificing, and found the wanderer; and having found it,[fn-49-P4923_1619220:35-nf] took it upon His shoulders-on which He also took the Wood of the Cross; and having taken it, brought it back to the higher life; and having carried it back, numbered it amongst those who had never strayed. Because He lighted a candle-His own Flesh-and swept the house, cleansing the world from sin; and sought the piece of money, the Royal Image that was covered up by passions. And He calls together His Angel friends on the finding of the coin, and makes them sharers in His joy,[fn-49-P4924_1619722:36-nf] whom He had made to share also the secret of the Incarnation? Because on the candle of the Forerunner there follows the light that exceeds in brightness; and to the Voice the Word succeeds; and to the Bridegroom's friend the Bridegroom; to him that prepared for the Lord a peculiar people, cleansing them by water in preparation for the Spirit? Dost thou reproach God with all this? Dost thou on this account deem Him lessened, because He girds Himself with a towel and washes His disciples' feet, and shows that humiliation is the best road to exaltation? Because for the soul that was bent to the ground He humbles Himself, that He may raise up with Himself the soul that was tottering to a fall under a weight of sin? Why dost thou not also charge upon Him as a crime the fact that He eats with Publicans and at Publicans' tables,[fn-49-P4925_1620573:37-nf] and that He makes disciples of Publicans, that He too may gain somewhat ... and what? ... the salvation of sinners. If so, we must blame the physician for stooping over sufferings, and enduring evil odours that he may give health to the sick; or one who as the Law commands bent down into a ditch to save a beast that had fallen into it.[fn-49-P4926_1621230:38-nf] XV. He was sent, but as man, for He was of a twofold Nature; for He was wearied, and hungered, and was thirsty, and was in an agony, and shed tears, according to the nature of a corporeal being. And if the expression be also used of Him as God, the meaning is that the Father's good pleasure is to be considered a Mission, for to this He refers all that concerns Himself; both that He may honour the Eternal Principle, and because He will not be taken to be an antagonistic God. And whereas it is written both that He was betrayed, and also that He gave Himself up[fn-49-P4927_1622591:39-nf] and that He was raised up by the Father, and taken up into heaven; and on the other hand, that He raised Himself and went up; the former statement of each pair refers to the good pleasure of the Father, the latter to His own Power. Are you then to be allowed to dwell upon all that humiliates Him, while passing over all that exalts Him, and to count on your side the fact that He suffered, but to leave out of the account the fact that it was of His own will? See what even now the Word has to suffer. By one set He is honoured as God, but is confused with the Father,[fn-49-P4928_1624045:40-nf] by another He is dishonoured as mere flesh[fn-49-P4929_1626838:41-nf] and severed from the Godhead. With which of them will He be most angry, or rather, which shall He forgive, those who injuriously confound Him or those who divide Him? For the former ought to have distinguished, and the latter to have united Him; the one in number, the other in Godhead. Stumblest Thou at His flesh? So did the Jews. Or dost thou call Him a Samaritan, and ... I will not say the rest. Dost thou disbelieve in His Godhead? This did not even the demons, O thou who art less believing than demons and more stupid than Jews. Those did perceive that the name of Son implies equality of rank; these did know that He who drove them out was God, for they were convinced of it by their own experience. But you will admit neither the equality nor the Godhead. It would have been better for you to have been either a Jew or a demoniac (if I may utter an absurdity), than in uncircumcision and m sound health to be so wicked and ungodly in your attitude of mind.","title":"Oration XXXVIII","author":"Gregory Nazianzen"},{"chapter":5,"verse":31,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_60_book_iii_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"49","folder":"ANF-01","text":"5. Such [a line of conduct] belongs not to those who heal, or who give life: it is rather that of those bringing on diseases, and increasing ignorance; and much more true than these men shall the law be found, which pronounces every one accursed who sends the blind man astray in the way. For the apostles, who were commissioned to find out the wanderers, and to be for sight to those who saw not, and medicine to the weak, certainly did not address them in accordance with their opinion at the time, but according to revealed truth. For no persons of any kind would act properly, if they should advise blind men, just about to fall over a precipice, to continue their most dangerous path, as if it were the right one, and as if they might go on in safety. Or what medical man, anxious to heal a sick person, would prescribe in accordance with the patient's whims, and not according to the requisite medicine? But that the Lord came as the physician of the sick, He does Himself declare saying, \"They that are whole need not a physician, but they that are sick; I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\"[fn-73-P7344_1961273:19-nf] How then shall the sick be strengthened, or how shall sinners come to repentance? Is it by persevering in the very same courses? or, on the contrary, is it by undergoing a great change and reversal of their former mode of living, by which they have brought upon themselves no slight amount of sickness, and many sins? But ignorance, the mother of all these, is driven out by knowledge. Wherefore the Lord used to impart knowledge to His disciples, by which also it was His practice to heal those who were suffering, and to keep back sinners from sin. He therefore did not address them in accordance with their pristine notions, nor did He reply to them in harmony with the opinion of His questioners, but according to the doctrine leading to salvation, without hypocrisy or respect of person.","title":"Book III.","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":5,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_51_oration_xxxix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"IX.

But if, when the Saviour came to this earth, He sent His apostles into the world to proclaim with accuracy His advent, and to teach the Father's will, having nothing in common with the doctrine of the Gentiles or of the Jews, much more, while yet existing in the Pleroma, would He have appointed His own heralds to proclaim His future advent into this world, and having nothing in common with those prophecies originating from the Demiurge.

On this account and reasonably, having said before, `I and the Father are One,' He added, `I in the Father and the Father in Me,[fn-65-P6525_2591232:27-nf] ' by way of shewing the identity[fn-65-P6526_2591282:28-nf] of Godhead and the unity of Essence. For they are one, not[fn-65-P6527_2591364:29-nf] as one thing divided into two parts, and these nothing but one, nor as one thing twice named, so that the Same becomes at one time Father, at another His own Son, for this Sabellius holding was judged an heretic. But They are two, because the Father is Father and is not also Son, and the Son is Son and not also Father[fn-65-P6528_2591708:30-nf] ; but the nature is one; (for the offspring is not unlike[fn-65-P6529_2591781:31-nf] its parent, for it is his image), and all that is the Father's, is the Son's[fn-65-P6530_2591995:32-nf] . Wherefore neither is the Son another God, for He was not procured from without, else were there many, if a godhead be procured foreign from the Father's[fn-65-P6531_2592274:33-nf] ; for if the Son be other, as an Offspring, still He is the Same as God; and He and the Father are one in propriety and peculiarity of nature, and in the identity of the one Godhead, as has been said. For the radiance also is light, not second to the sun, nor a different light, nor from participation of it, but a whole and proper offspring of it. And such an offspring is necessarily one light; and no one would say that they are two lights[fn-65-P6532_2592732:34-nf] , but sun and radiance two, yet one the light from the sun enlightening in its radiance all things. So also the Godhead of the Son is the Father's; whence also it is indivisible; and thus there is one God and none other but He. And so, since they are one, and the Godhead itself one, the same things are said of the Son, which are said of the Father, except His being said to be Father[fn-65-P6533_2593166:35-nf] :-for instance[fn-65-P6534_2593200:36-nf] , that He is God, `And the Word was God[fn-65-P6535_2593269:37-nf] ;' Almighty, `Thus saith He which was and is and is to come, the Almighty[fn-65-P6536_2593359:38-nf] ;' Lord, `One Lord Jesus Christ[fn-65-P6537_2593407:39-nf] ;' that He is Light, `I am the Light[fn-65-P6538_2593465:40-nf] ;' that He wipes out sins, `that ye may know,' He says, `that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins[fn-65-P6539_2593600:41-nf] ;' and so with other attributes.

And this bishop Restitutus has reported to have been done in his own diocese, and he has with good reason requested that when the bishops of those places where they ought not to have been ordained die in the natural course, the places themselves should revert to the jurisdiction of the same prelate to whom they formerly belonged and were attached. It is indeed useless for the priestly dignity to be diminished by the superfluous multiplications of the office through the inconsiderate complaisance of the ordainer.","title":"Letter XII.","author":false}]
