That famous purple, therefore, and the gold as an ornament of the neck, were, among the Egyptians and Babylonians, ensigns of dignity, in the same way as bordered, or striped, or palm-embroidered togas, and the golden wreaths of provincial priests, are now; but not on the same terms. For they used only to be conferred, under the name of honour, on such as deserved the familiar friendship of kings (whence, too, such used to be styled the \"purpled-men\"[fn-7-P794_325944:132-nf] of kings, just as among us,[fn-7-P795_325997:133-nf] some, from their white toga, are called \"candidates\"[fn-7-P796_326101:134-nf] ); but not on the understanding that that garb should be tied to priesthoods also, or to any idol-ceremonies. For if that were the case, of course men of such holiness and constancy[fn-7-P797_326307:135-nf] would instantly have refused the defiled dresses; and it would instantly have appeared that Daniel had been no zealous slave to idols, nor worshipped Bel, nor the dragon, which long after did appear. That purple, therefore, was simple, and used not at that time to be a mark of dignity[fn-7-P798_326619:136-nf] among the barbarians, but of nobility.[fn-7-P799_326691:137-nf] For as both Joseph, who had been a slave, and Daniel, who through[fn-8-P800_326794:138-nf] captivity had changed his state, attained the freedom of the states of Babylon and Egypt through the dress of barbaric nobility;[fn-8-P801_326944:139-nf] so among us believers also, if need so be, the bordered toga will be proper to be conceded to boys, and the stole to girls,[fn-8-P802_327131:140-nf] as ensigns of birth, not of power; of race, not of office; of rank, not of superstition. But the purple, or the other ensigns of dignities and powers, dedicated from the beginning to idolatry engrafted on the dignity and the powers, carry the spot of their own profanation; since, moreover, bordered and striped togas, and broad-barred ones, are put even on idols themselves; and fasces also, and rods, are borne before them; and deservedly, for demons are the magistrates of this world: they bear the fasces and the purples, the ensigns of one college. What end, then, will you advance if you use the garb indeed, but administer not the functions of it? In things unclean, none can appear clean. If you put on a tunic defiled in itself, it perhaps may not be defiled through you; but you, through it, will be unable to be clean.

And when, accompanied by Christ, we shall have made our way back to our cave through Shiloh and Bethel, and those other places where churches are set up like standards to commemorate the Lord's victories, then we shall sing heartily, we shall weep copiously, we shall pray unceasingly.

Of your father too I speak with respect, not because he is a patrician and of consular rank but because he is a Christian. Let him be true to his profession as such. Let him rejoice that he has begotten a daughter for Christ and not for the world. Nay rather let him grieve that you have in vain lost your virginity as the fruits of matrimony have not been yours. Where is the husband whom he gave to you? Even had he been lovable and good, death would still have snatched all away, and his decease would have terminated the fleshly bond between you. Seize the opportunity, I beg of you, and make a virtue of necessity. In the lives of Christians we look not to the beginnings but to the endings. Paul began badly but ended well. The start of Judas wins praise; his end is condemned because of his treachery.

I must briefly mention the manner in which she avoided the foul cisterns of the heretics whom she regarded as no better than heathen. A certain cunning knave, in his own estimation both learned and clever, began without my knowledge to put to her such questions as these: What sin has an infant committed that it should be seized by the devil? Shall we be young or old when we rise again? If we die young and rise young, we shall after the resurrection require to have nurses. If however we die young and rise old, the dead will not rise again at all: they will be transformed into new beings. Will there be a distinction of sexes in the next world? Or will there be no such distinction? If the distinction continues, there will be wedlock and sexual intercourse and procreation of children. If however it does not continue, the bodies that rise again will not be the same. For, he argued, \"the earthy tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things,\"[fn-41-P4120_1108799:2971-nf] but the bodies that we shall have in heaven will be subtle and spiritual according to the words of the apostle: \"it is sown a natural body: it is raised a spiritual body.\"[fn-41-P4121_1108995:2972-nf] From all of which considerations he sought to prove that rational creatures have been for their faults and previous sins subjected to bodily conditions; and that according to the nature and guilt of their transgression they are born in this or that state of life. Some, he said, rejoice in sound bodies and wealthy and noble parents; others have for their portion diseased frames and poverty stricken homes; and by imprisonment in the present world and in bodies pay the penalty of their former sins. Paula listened and reported what she heard to me, at the same time pointing out the man. Thus upon me was laid the task of opposing this most noxious viper and deadly pest. It is of such that the Psalmist speaks when he writes: \"deliver not the soul of thy turtle dove unto the wild beast,\"[fn-41-P4122_1109816:2973-nf] and \"Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds;\"[fn-41-P4123_1109888:2974-nf] creatures who write iniquity and speak lies against the Lord and lift up their mouths against the Most High. As the fellow had tried to deceive Paula, I at her request went to him, and by asking him a few questions involved him in a dilemma. Do you believe, said I, that there will be a resurrection of the dead or do you disbelieve? He replied, I believe. I went on: Will the bodies that rise again be the same or different? He said, The same. Then I asked: What of their sex? Will that remain unaltered or will it be changed? At this question he became silent and swayed his head this way and that as a serpent does to avoid being struck. Accordingly I continued, As you have nothing to say I will answer for you and will draw the conclusion from your premises. If the woman shall not rise again as a woman nor the man as a man, there will be no resurrection of the dead. For the body is made up of sex and members. But if there shall be no sex and no members what will become of the resurrection of the body, which cannot exist without sex and members? And if there shall be no resurrection of the body, there can be no resurrection of the dead. But as to your objection taken from marriage, that, if the members shall remain the same, marriage must inevitably be allowed; it is disposed of by the Saviour's words: \"ye do err not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God. For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels.\"[fn-41-P4124_1111400:2975-nf] When it is said that they neither marry nor are given in marriage, the distinction of sex is shewn to persist. For no one says of things which have no capacity for marriage such as a stick or a stone that they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but this may well be said of those who while they can marry yet abstain from doing so by their own virtue and by the grace of Christ. But if you cavil at this and say, how shall we in that case be like the angels with whom there is neither male nor female, hear my answer in brief as follows. What the Lord promises to us is not the nature of angels but their mode of life and their bliss. And therefore John the Baptist is called an angel[fn-41-P4125_1112165:2976-nf] even before he is beheaded, and all God's holy men and virgins manifest in themselves even in this world the life of angels.

Yea, rather, for that she was fully confident that Thou, who hadst promised the whole, wouldst give the rest, most calmly, and with a breast full of confidence, she replied to me, \"She believed in Christ, that before she departed this life, she would see me a Catholic believer.\"[fn-8-P849_303990:4-nf] And thus much said she to me; but to Thee, O Fountain of mercies, poured she out more frequent prayers and tears, that Thou wouldest hasten Thy aid, and enlighten my darkness; and she hurried all the more assiduously to the church, and hung upon the words of Ambrose, praying for the fountain of water that springeth up into everlasting life.[fn-8-P850_306646:5-nf] For she loved that man as an angel of God, because she knew that it was by him that I had been brought, for the present, to that perplexing state of agitation[fn-8-P851_306821:6-nf] I was now in, through which she was fully persuaded that I should pass from sickness unto health, after an excess, as it were. of a sharper fit, which doctors term the \"crisis.\"","title":"Book VI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":7,"verse":26,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_17_vi_on_monogamy_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"41","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Turning now to the law, which is properly ours-that is, to the Gospel-by what kind of examples are we met, until we come to definite dogmas?

But I will tell thee also of events which have happened in our own time, and of which thou mayest thyself have been witness You know probably that young Phoenician, the son of Urbanus, who was untimely left an orphan, but possessed of much money, and many slaves and lands. This man, having in the first place bidden complete farewell to his studies in the schools, and having laid aside the gay clothing which he formerly wore, and all his worldly grandeur, suddenly arraying himself in a shabby cloak, and retreating to the solitude of the mountains, exhibited a high degree of Christian philosophy not merely in proportion to the sacred mysteries, he made still greater advances in virtue. And all were rejoicing, and a mere youth, should have suddenly trodden all the pomps of this life under foot, and have ascended to the true height. Now which he was in this condition, and an object of admiration, certain corrupt men, who according to the law of kindred had the oversight of him dragged him back again into the former sea of worldliness. And so, having flung aside all his habits, he again descended from the mountains into the midst of the forum, and used to go all round the city, riding on horseback, and accompanied by a large retinue; and he was no longer willing to live even soberly; for being inflamed by much luxury, he was constrained to fall into foolish love intrigues, and there was no one of those conversant with him, who did not despair of his salvation; he was encompassed by such a swarm of flatterers, besides the snares of orphanhood, youth, and great wealth. And persons who readily find fault with everything, accused those who originally conducted him to this way of life,[fn-6-P695_416887:71-nf] saying that he had both missed his spiritual aims, and would no longer be of any use in the management of his own affairs, having prematurely abandoned the labours of study, and having been consequently unable to derive any benefit therefrom. Now while these things were of chase, and had thoroughly learned by experience that those who are armed with hope in God ought not to despair at all of such characters, kept a continual watch upon him, and if ever they saw him appear in the market place they approached and saluted him. And at first he spoke to them from horseback, askance, as they followed by his side; so great was the shamelessness which had at first got possession of him. But they, being merciful and loving men, were not ashamed at all of this treatment, but continually looked to one thing only, how they might rescue the lamb from the wolves; which in fact they actually accomplished by means of their perseverance. For afterwards, as if he had been converted by some sudden stroke, and were put to shame by their great assiduity if ever he saw them in the distance approaching, he would instantly dismount, and bending low would listen silently in that attitude to all which fell from their lips, and in time he displayed even greater reverence and respect towards them. And then, by the grace of God having gradually rescued him out of all those entanglements, they handed him over again to his former state of seclusion and devout contemplation. And now he became so illustrious, that his former life seemed to be nothing in comparison with that which he lived after his fall. For being well aware by experience of the snare, and having expended all his wealth upon the needy, and released himself from all care of that kind, he cut off every pretext for an attack from those who wished to make designs upon him; and now treading the path which leads to heaven, he has already arrived at the very goal of virtue.","title":"Letter I.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":7,"verse":27,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_19_an_answer_to_the_jews_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"105","folder":"ANF-03","text":"\"But if the Christ,\" say they, \"who is believed to be coming is not called Jesus, why is he who is come called Jesus Christ? \"Well, each name will meet in the Christ of God, in whom is found likewise the appellation[fn-22-P2283_756698:160-nf] Jesus. Learn the habitual character of your error. In the course of the appointing of a successor to Moses, Oshea[fn-22-P2284_757007:161-nf] the son of Nun[fn-22-P2285_757051:162-nf] is certainly transferred from his pristine name, and begins to be called Jesus.[fn-22-P2286_757158:163-nf] Certainly, you say. This we first assert to have been a figure of the future.

So far I have replied to the separate portions of his argument; I shall now address myself to the general question. Our Lord says to his disciples,[fn-68-P6892_2202528:265-nf] \"Whosoever would become great among you, let him be least of all.\" If we are all to be equal in heaven, in vain do we humble ourselves here that we may be greater there. Of the two debtors who owed, one five hundred pence, the other fifty, he to whom most was forgiven loved most. And so the Saviour says,[fn-68-P6893_2202858:266-nf] \"I say to you, her sins which are many are forgiven her, for she hath loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.\" He who loves little, and has little forgiven, he will of coarse be of inferior rank.[fn-68-P6894_2203106:267-nf] The householder when he set out delivered to his servants his goods, to one five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Just as in another Gospel it is written that a nobleman setting out for a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and return, called the servants, and gave them each a sum of money, with which one gained ten pounds, another five, and they, each according to his ability and the gain he had made, received ten or five cities. But one who had received a talent, or a pound, buried it in the ground, or tied it up in a napkin, and kept it until his master's return. Our first thought is that if, according to the modern Zeno, the righteous do not toil in hope of reward, but to avoid the loss of what they already have. he who buried his pound or talent that he might not lose it, did no wrong, and the caution of him who kept his money is worthy of more praise than the fruitless toil of those who wore themselves out and yet received no reward for their labour. Then observe that the very talent which was taken from the timid or negligent servant, was not l given to him who had the smaller profit, but to him who had gained the most, that is, to him who had been placed over ten cities. If difference of rank is not constituted by the difference in number, why did our Lord say, \"He gave to everyone according to his ability\"? If the gain of five talents and ten talents is the same, why were not ten cities given to him who gained the least, and five to him who gained the most?But that our Lord is not satisfied with what we have, but always desires more, He himself shows by saying, \"Wherefore didst thou not give my money to the money-changers, that so when I came I might have received it with usury?\" The Apostle Paul understood this, and[fn-68-P6895_2204942:268-nf] forgetting those things which were behind, reached forward to those things which were in front, that is, he made daily progress, and did not keep the grace given to him carefully wrapped up in a napkin, but his spirit, like the capital of a keen man of business, was renewed from day to day, and if he were not always growing larger, he thought himself growing less. Six cities of refuge are mentioned in the law, provided for fugitives who were involuntary homicides, and the cities themselves belonged to the priests. I should like to ask whether you would put those fugitives among your goats, or among our sheep. If they were goats, they would be slain like other homicides, and would not enter the cities of God's ministers. If you say they were sheep, they will not possibly be such sheep as can enjoy full liberty and feed without fear of wolves. And it will be plain to you that sheep indeed they are, but wandering sheep: that they are on the right hand, but do not stand there: they flee until the High Priest dies and descending into hell liberates their souls. The Gibeonites met the children of lsrael, and although other nations were slaughtered, they were kept[fn-68-P6896_2206140:269-nf] for hewers of wood and drawers of water.[fn-68-P6897_2206202:270-nf] And of such value were they in God's eyes, that the family of Saul was destroyed for the wrong done to them. Where would you put them?Among the goats?But they were not slain, and they were avenged by the determination of God. Among the sheep? But Idly Scripture says they were not of the same merit as the Israelites. Yousee then that they do indeed stand on the right hand, but are of a far inferior grade. Jonathan came between David, the holy man, and Saul, the worst of kings, and we can neither place him among the kids because he was worthy of a prophet's love, nor amongst the rams test we make him equal to David, and particularly when we know that he was slain. He will, therefore, be among the sheep, but low down. And just as in the case of David and Jonathan, you will be bound to recognize differences between sheep and sheep.[fn-68-P6898_2207064:271-nf] \"That servant, which knew his lord's will, and made not ready, nor did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes; but he that knew not, and did things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. And to whomsoever much is given, of him shall much be required: and to whom they commit much, of him will they ask the more.\" Lo! more or less is committed to different servants, and according to the nature of the trust, as well as of the sin, is the number of stripes inflicted.","title":"Book II.","author":false},{"chapter":7,"verse":32,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_12_book_i","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"250","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Now I broach these ridiculously childish suggestions as to children sitting in the market-place and playing[fn-9-P927_508386:175-nf] ; for when one looks into the grovelling earthliness of their heretical teaching it is impossible to help falling into a sort of sportive childishness. It would be right, however, to add this to what we have said, viz., that, as the idea of eternity is completed only by means of both (as we have already argued), by the negation of a beginning and also by that of an end, if they confine God's being to the one, their definition of this being will be manifestly imperfect and curtailed by half; it is thought of only by the absence of beginning, and does not contain the absence of end within itself as an essential element. But if they do combine both negations, and so complete their definition of the being of God, observe, again, the absurdity that is at once apparent in this view; it will be found, after all their efforts, to be at variance not only with the Only-begotten, but with itself. The case is clear and does not require much dwelling upon. The idea of a beginning and the idea of an end are opposed each to each; the meanings of each differ as widely as the other diametric oppositions[fn-9-P928_509511:176-nf] , where there is no half-way proposition below[fn-9-P929_509636:177-nf] . If any one is asked to define `beginning,' he will not give a definition the same as that of end; but will carry his definition of it to the opposite extremity. Therefore also the two contraries[fn-9-P930_510133:178-nf] of these will be separated from each other by the same distance of opposition; and that which is without beginning, being contrary to that which is to be seen by a beginning, will be a very different thing from that which is endless, or the negation of end. If, then, they import both these attributes into the being of God, I mean the negations of end and of beginning, they will exhibit this Deity of theirs as a combination of two contradictory and discordant things, because the contrary ideas to beginning and end reproduce on their side also tile contradiction existing between beginning and end. Contraries of contradictories are themselves contradictory of each other. In fact, it is always a true axiom, that two things which are naturally opposed to two things mutually opposite are themselves opposed to each other; as we may see by example. Water is opposed to fire; therefore also the forces destructive of these are opposed to each other; if moistness is apt to extinguish fire, and dryness is apt to destroy water, the opposition of fire to water is continued in those qualities themselves which are contrary to them; so that dryness is plainly opposed to moistness. Thus, when beginning and end have to be placed (diametrically) opposite each other[fn-9-P931_511471:179-nf] , the terms contrary to these also contradict each other in their meaning, I mean, the negations of end and of beginning. Well, then, if they determine that one only of these negations is indicative of the being (to repeat my former assertion), they will bear evidence to half only of God's existence, confining it to the absence of beginning, and refusing to extend it to the absence of end; whereas, if they import both into their definition of it, they will actually exhibit it so as a combination of contradictions in the way that has been said; for these two negations of beginning and of end, by virtue of the contradiction existing between beginning and end, will part it asunder. So their Deity will be found to be a sort of patchwork compound, a conglomerate of contradictions.","title":"Book I","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":7,"verse":34,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_21_viii_on_fasting_in_opposition_to_the_psychics_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"24","folder":"ANF-04","text":"For, so far as pertains to fasts, they oppose to us the definite days appointed by God: as when, in Leviticus, the Lord enjoins upon Moses the tenth day of the seventh month (as) a day of atonement, saying, \"Holy shall be to you the day, and ye shall vex your souls; and every soul which shall not have been vexed in that day shall be exterminated from his people.\"[fn-17-P1710_501509:4-nf] At all events, in the Gospel they think that those days were definitely appointed for fasts in which \"the Bridegroom was taken away; \"[fn-17-P1711_501675:5-nf] and that these are now the only legitimate days for Christian fasts, the legal and prophetical antiquities having been abolished: for wherever it suits their wishes, they recognise what is the meaning of\" the Law and the prophets until John.\"[fn-17-P1712_501970:6-nf] Accordingly, (they think) that, with regard to the future, fasting was to be indifferently observed, by the New Discipline, of choice, not of command, according to the times and needs of each individual: that this, withal, had been the observance of the apostles, imposing (as they did) no other yoke of definite fasts to be observed by all generally, nor similarly of Stations either, which (they think) have withal days of their own (the fourth and sixth days of the week), but yet take a wide range according to individual judgment, neither subject to the law of a given precept, nor (to be protracted) beyond the last hour of the day, since even prayers the ninth hour generally concludes, after Peter's example, which is recorded in the Acts.

There are four emotions which agitate mankind, two relating to the present, two to the future; two to good, and two to evil. There is sorrow, called in Greek lu/ph, and joy, in Greek xara/ or h9donh/, although many translate the latter word by voluptas, pleasure; the one of which is referred to evil, the other to good. And we go too far if we rejoice over such things as we ought not, as, for example, riches, power, distinctions, the bad fortune of enemies, or their death; or, on the other hand, if we are tortured with grief on account of present evils, adversity, exile, poverty, weakness, and the death of kindred, all of which is forbidden by the Apostle. And again, if we covet those things which we consider good, inheritance, distinctions, unvaried prosperity, bodily health, and the like, in the possession of which we rejoice and find enjoyment; or if we fear those things which we deem adverse. Now, according to the Stoics, Zeno that is to say and Chrysippus, it is possible for a perfect man to be free from these emotions; according to the Peripatetics, it is difficult and even impossible, an opinion which has the constant support of all Scripture.

Why, however, might He not have used the example of faith in another[fn-59-P5947_1792781:658-nf] god? Because, if He had done so, He would have said that no such faith had ever had existence in Israel; but as the case stands,[fn-59-P5948_1792933:659-nf] He intimates that He ought to have found so great a faith in Israel, inasmuch as He had indeed come for the purpose of finding it, being in truth the God and Christ of Israel, and had now stigmatized[fn-59-P5949_1793149:660-nf] it, only as one who would enforce and Uphold it.

He raised also the widow's son from death.[fn-59-P5952_1793485:663-nf] This was not a strange miracle.[fn-59-P5953_1793541:664-nf] The Creator's prophets had wrought such; then why not His Son much rather? Now, so evidently had the Lord Christ introduced no other god for the working of so momentous a miracle as this, that all who were present gave glory to the Creator, saying: \"A great prophet is risen up among us, and God hath visited His people.\"[fn-59-P5954_1793882:665-nf] What God? He, of course, whose people they were, and from whom had come their prophets. But if they glorified the Creator, and Christ (on hearing them, and knowing their meaning) refrained from correcting them even in their very act of invoking[fn-59-P5955_1794148:666-nf] the Creator in that vast manifestation of His glory in this raising of the dead, undoubtedly He either announced no other God but Him, whom He thus permitted to be honoured in His own beneficent acts and miracles, or else how happens it that He quietly permitted these persons to remain so long in their error, especially as He came for the very purpose to cure them of their error? But John is offended[fn-59-P5956_1794584:667-nf] when he hears of the miracles of Christ, as of an alien god.[fn-59-P5957_1794761:668-nf] Well, I on my side[fn-59-P5958_1794869:669-nf] will first explain the reason of his offence, that I may the more easily explode the scandal[fn-59-P5959_1794974:670-nf] of our heretic. Now, that the very Lord Himself of all might, the Word and Spirit of the Father,[fn-59-P5960_1795171:671-nf] was operating and preaching on earth, it was necessary that the portion of the Holy Spirit which, in the form of the prophetic gift,[fn-59-P5961_1795780:672-nf] had been through John preparing the ways of the Lord, should now depart from John,[fn-59-P5962_1795898:673-nf] and return back again of course to the Lord, as to its all-embracing original.[fn-59-P5963_1796513:674-nf] Therefore John, being now an ordinary person, and only one of the many,[fn-59-P5964_1796620:675-nf] was offended indeed as a man, but not because he expected or thought of another Christ as teaching or doing nothing new, for he was not even expecting such a one.[fn-59-P5965_1796809:676-nf] Nobody will entertain doubts about any one whom (since he knows him not to exist) he has no expectation or thought of. Now John was quite sure that there was no other God but the Creator, even as a Jew, especially as a prophet.[fn-59-P5966_1797052:677-nf] Whatever doubt he felt was evidently rather[fn-59-P5967_1797120:678-nf] entertained about Him[fn-59-P5968_1797159:679-nf] whom he knew indeed to exist but knew not whether He were the very Christ. With this fear, therefore, even John asks the question, \"Art thou He that should come, or look we for another? \"[fn-59-P5969_1797361:680-nf] -simply inquiring whether He was come as He whom he was looking for. \"Art thou He that should come? \"i.e. Art thou the coming One? \"or look we for another? \"i.e. Is He whom we are expecting some other than Thou, if Thou art not He whom we expect to come? For he was supposing,[fn-59-P5970_1797659:681-nf] as all men then thought, from the similarity of the miraculous evidences,[fn-59-P5971_1797750:682-nf] that a prophet might possibly have been meanwhile sent, from whom the Lord Himself, whose coming was then expected, was different, and to whom He was superior.[fn-59-P5972_1797931:683-nf] And there lay John's difficulty.[fn-59-P5973_1797978:684-nf] He was in doubt whether He was actually come whom all men were looking for; whom, moreover, they ought to have recognised by His predicted works, even as the Lord sent word to John, that it was by means of these very works that He was to be recognised.[fn-59-P5974_1798249:685-nf] Now, inasmuch as these predictions evidently related to the Creator's Christ-as we have proved in the examination of each of them-it was perverse enough, if he gave himself out to be not the Christ of the Creator, and rested the proof of his statement on those very evidences whereby he was urging his claims to be received as the Creator's Christ. Far greater still is his perverseness when, not being the Christ of John,[fn-59-P5975_1798698:686-nf] he yet bestows on John his testimony, affirming him to be a prophet, nay more, his messenger,[fn-59-P5976_1798979:687-nf] applying to him the Scripture, \"Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.\"[fn-59-P5977_1799114:688-nf] He graciously[fn-59-P5978_1799172:689-nf] adduced the prophecy in the superior sense of the alternative mentioned by the perplexed John, in order that, by affirming that His own precursor was already come in the person of John, He might quench the doubt[fn-59-P5979_1799402:690-nf] which lurked in his question: \"Art thou He that, should come, or look we for another? \"Now that the forerunner had fulfilled his mission, and the way of the Lord was prepared, He ought now to be acknowledged as that (Christ) for whom the forerunner had made ready the way. That forerunner was indeed \"greater than all of women born; \"[fn-59-P5980_1799755:691-nf] but for all that, He who was least in the kingdom of God[fn-59-P5981_1799833:692-nf] was not subject to him;[fn-59-P5982_1799921:693-nf] as if the kingdom in which the least person was greater than John belonged to one God, while John, who was greater than all of women born, belonged himself to another God. For whether He speaks of any \"least person\" by reason of his humble position, or of Himself, as being thought to be less than John-since all were running into the wilderness after John rather than after Christ (\"What went ye out into the wilderness to see? \"[fn-59-P5983_1801460:694-nf] )-the Creator has equal right[fn-59-P5984_1801511:695-nf] to claim as His own both John, greater than any born of women, and Christ, or every \"least person in the kingdom of heaven,\" who was destined to be greater than John in that kingdom, although equally pertaining to the Creator, and who would be so much greater than the prophet,[fn-59-P5985_1801825:696-nf] because he would not have been offended at Christ, an infirmity which then lessened the greatness of John.We have already spoken of the forgiveness[fn-59-P5986_1802002:697-nf] of sins.

If, indeed, He had been its antagonist,[fn-59-P5950_1793258:661-nf] He would have preferred finding it to be such faith,[fn-59-P5951_1793327:662-nf] having come to weaken and destroy it rather than to approve of it. He raised also the widow's son from death.[fn-59-P5952_1793485:663-nf] This was not a strange miracle.[fn-59-P5953_1793541:664-nf] The Creator's prophets had wrought such; then why not His Son much rather? Now, so evidently had the Lord Christ introduced no other god for the working of so momentous a miracle as this, that all who were present gave glory to the Creator, saying: \"A great prophet is risen up among us, and God hath visited His people.\"[fn-59-P5954_1793882:665-nf] What God? He, of course, whose people they were, and from whom had come their prophets. But if they glorified the Creator, and Christ (on hearing them, and knowing their meaning) refrained from correcting them even in their very act of invoking[fn-59-P5955_1794148:666-nf] the Creator in that vast manifestation of His glory in this raising of the dead, undoubtedly He either announced no other God but Him, whom He thus permitted to be honoured in His own beneficent acts and miracles, or else how happens it that He quietly permitted these persons to remain so long in their error, especially as He came for the very purpose to cure them of their error? But John is offended[fn-59-P5956_1794584:667-nf] when he hears of the miracles of Christ, as of an alien god.[fn-59-P5957_1794761:668-nf] Well, I on my side[fn-59-P5958_1794869:669-nf] will first explain the reason of his offence, that I may the more easily explode the scandal[fn-59-P5959_1794974:670-nf] of our heretic. Now, that the very Lord Himself of all might, the Word and Spirit of the Father,[fn-59-P5960_1795171:671-nf] was operating and preaching on earth, it was necessary that the portion of the Holy Spirit which, in the form of the prophetic gift,[fn-59-P5961_1795780:672-nf] had been through John preparing the ways of the Lord, should now depart from John,[fn-59-P5962_1795898:673-nf] and return back again of course to the Lord, as to its all-embracing original.[fn-59-P5963_1796513:674-nf] Therefore John, being now an ordinary person, and only one of the many,[fn-59-P5964_1796620:675-nf] was offended indeed as a man, but not because he expected or thought of another Christ as teaching or doing nothing new, for he was not even expecting such a one.[fn-59-P5965_1796809:676-nf] Nobody will entertain doubts about any one whom (since he knows him not to exist) he has no expectation or thought of. Now John was quite sure that there was no other God but the Creator, even as a Jew, especially as a prophet.[fn-59-P5966_1797052:677-nf] Whatever doubt he felt was evidently rather[fn-59-P5967_1797120:678-nf] entertained about Him[fn-59-P5968_1797159:679-nf] whom he knew indeed to exist but knew not whether He were the very Christ. With this fear, therefore, even John asks the question, \"Art thou He that should come, or look we for another? \"[fn-59-P5969_1797361:680-nf] -simply inquiring whether He was come as He whom he was looking for. \"Art thou He that should come? \"i.e. Art thou the coming One? \"or look we for another? \"i.e. Is He whom we are expecting some other than Thou, if Thou art not He whom we expect to come?

Far greater still is his perverseness when, not being the Christ of John,[fn-59-P5975_1798698:686-nf] he yet bestows on John his testimony, affirming him to be a prophet, nay more, his messenger,[fn-59-P5976_1798979:687-nf] applying to him the Scripture, \"Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.\"[fn-59-P5977_1799114:688-nf] He graciously[fn-59-P5978_1799172:689-nf] adduced the prophecy in the superior sense of the alternative mentioned by the perplexed John, in order that, by affirming that His own precursor was already come in the person of John, He might quench the doubt[fn-59-P5979_1799402:690-nf] which lurked in his question: \"Art thou He that, should come, or look we for another? \"Now that the forerunner had fulfilled his mission, and the way of the Lord was prepared, He ought now to be acknowledged as that (Christ) for whom the forerunner had made ready the way.

By Isaiah the Lord called these wealthy ladies-\"Rise up, ye women that are at ease, and hear my voice\"[fn-59-P5994_1803340:702-nf] -that He might prove[fn-59-P5995_1803604:703-nf] them first as disciples, and then as assistants and helpers: \"Daughters, hear my words in hope; this day of the year cherish the memory of, in labour with hope.\" For it was \"in labour\" that they followed Him, and \"with hope\" did they minister to Him. On the subject of parables, let it suffice that it has been once for all shown that this kind of language[fn-59-P5996_1803980:704-nf] was with equal distinctness promised by the Creator. But there is that direct mode of His speaking[fn-59-P5997_1804095:705-nf] to the people\"Ye shall hear with the ear, but ye shall not understand\"[fn-59-P5998_1804187:706-nf] -which now claims notice as having furnished to Christ that frequent form of His earnest instruction: \"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.\"[fn-59-P5999_1804352:707-nf] Not as if Christ, actuated with a diverse spirit, permitted a hearing which the Creator had refused; but because the exhortation followed the threatening. First came, \"Ye shall hear with the ear, but shall not understand; \"then followed, \"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.\" For they wilfully refused to hear, although they had ears. He, however, was teaching them that it was the ears of the heart which were necessary; and with these the Creator had said that they would not hear. Therefore it is that He adds by His Christ, \"Take heed how ye hear,\"[fn-60-P6000_1804931:708-nf] and hear not,-meaning, of course, with the hearing of the heart, not of the ear. If you only attach a proper, sense to the Creator's admonition[fn-60-P6001_1805097:709-nf] suitable to the meaning of Him who was rousing the people to hear by the words, \"Take heed how ye hear,\" it amounted to a menace to such as would not hear. In fact,[fn-60-P6002_1805285:710-nf] that most merciful god of yours, who judges not, neither is angry, is minatory. This is proved even by the sentence which immediately follows: \"Whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.\"[fn-60-P6003_1805589:711-nf] What shall be given? The increase of faith, or understanding, or even salvation. What shall be taken away? That, of course, which shall be, given. By whom shall the gift and the deprivation be made? If by the Creator it be taken away, by Him also shall it be given. If by Marcion's god it be given, by Marcion's god also will it be taken away. Now, for whatever reason He threatens the \"deprivation,\" it will not be the work of a god who knows not how to threaten, because incapable of anger. I am, moreover, astonished when he says that \"a candle is not usually hidden,\"[fn-60-P6004_1806183:712-nf] who had hidden himself-a greater and more needful light-during so long a time; and when he promises that \"everything shall be brought out of its secrecy and made manifest,\"[fn-60-P6005_1806378:713-nf] who hitherto has kept his god in obscurity, waiting (I suppose) until Marcion be born.

They say that He testifies Himself to His not having been born, when He asks, \"Who is my mother, and who are my brethren? \"[fn-60-P6006_1806717:714-nf] In this manner heretics either wrest plain and simple words to any sense they choose by their conjectures, or else they violently resolve by a literal interpretation words which imply a conditional sense and are incapable of a simple solution,[fn-60-P6007_1806983:715-nf] as in this passage. We, for our part, say in reply, first, that it could not possibly have been told Him that His mother and His brethren stood without, desiring to see Him, if He had had no mother and no brethren. They must have been known to him who announced them, either some time previously, or then at that very time, when they desired to see Him, or sent Him their message. To this our first position this answer is usually given by the other side. But suppose they sent Him the message for the purpose of tempting Him? Well, but the Scripture does not say so; and inasmuch as it is usual for it to indicate what is done in the way of temptation (\"Behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted Him; \"[fn-60-P6008_1807770:716-nf] again, when inquiring about tribute, the Pharisees came to Him, tempting Him[fn-60-P6009_1807866:717-nf] ), so, when it makes no mention of temptation, it does not admit the interpretation of temptation. However, although I do not allow this sense, I may as well ask, by way of a superfluous refutation, for the reasons of the alleged temptation, To what purpose could they have tempted Him by naming His mother and His brethren? If it was to ascertain whether He had been born or not-when was a question raised on this point, which they must resolve by tempting Him in this way? Who could doubt His having been born, when they[fn-60-P6010_1808409:718-nf] saw Him before them a veritable man?-whom they had heard call Himself \"Son of man? \"-of whom they doubted whether He were God or Son of God, from seeing Him, as they did, in the perfect garb of human quality?-supposing Him rather to be a prophet, a great one indeed,[fn-60-P6011_1808752:719-nf] but still one who had been born as man? Even if it had been necessary that He should thus be tried in the investigation of His birth, surely any other proof would have better answered the trial than that to be obtained from mentioning those relatives which it was quite possible for Him, in spite of His true nativity, not at that moment to have had. For tell me now, does a mother live on contemporaneously[fn-60-P6012_1809220:720-nf] with her sons in every case? Have all sons brothers born for them?[fn-60-P6013_1809303:721-nf] May a man rather not have fathers and sisters (living), or even no relatives at all? But there is historical proof[fn-60-P6014_1809440:722-nf] that at this very time[fn-60-P6015_1809516:723-nf] a census had been taken in Judµa by Sentius Saturninus,[fn-60-P6016_1809640:724-nf] which might have satisfied their inquiry respecting the family and descent of Christ. Such a method of testing the point had therefore no consistency whatever in it and they \"who were standing without\" were really \"His mother and His brethren.\" It remains for us to examine His meaning when He resorts to non-literal[fn-60-P6017_1811442:725-nf] words, saying \"Who is my mother or my brethren? \"It seems as if His language amounted to a denial of His family and His birth; but it arose actually from the absolute nature of the case, and the conditional sense in which His words were to be explained.[fn-60-P6018_1811791:726-nf] He was justly indignant, that persons so very near to Him\" stood without,\" while strangers were within hanging on His words, especially as they wanted to call Him away from the solemn work He had in hand. He did not so much deny as disavow[fn-60-P6019_1812120:727-nf] them. And therefore, when to the previous question, \"Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?[fn-60-P6020_1812353:728-nf] He added the answer \"None but they who hear my words and do them,\" He transferred the names of blood-relationship to others, whom He judged to be more closely related to Him by reason of their faith. Now no one transfers a thing except from him who possesses that which is transferred. If, therefore, He made them \"His mother and His brethren\" who were not so, how could He deny them these relationships who really had them? Surely only on the condition of their deserts, and not by any disavowal of His near relatives; teaching them by His own actual example,[fn-60-P6021_1812984:729-nf] that \"whosoever preferred father or mother or brethren to the Word of God, was not a disciple worthy of Him.\"[fn-60-P6022_1813115:730-nf] Besides,[fn-60-P6023_1813144:731-nf] His admission of His mother and His brethren was the more express, from the fact of His unwillingness to acknowledge them. That He adopted others only confirmed those in their relationship to Him whom He refused because of their offence, and for whom He substituted the others, not as being truer relatives, but worthier ones. Finally, it was no great matter if He did prefer to kindred (that) faith which it[fn-60-P6024_1813569:732-nf] did not possess.[fn-60-P6025_1813643:733-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":7,"verse":25,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"89","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But \"what manner of man is this? for He commandeth even the winds and water!\"[fn-60-P6029_1814577:734-nf] Of course He is the new master and proprietor of the elements, now that the Creator is deposed, and excluded from their possession! Nothing of the kind. But the elements own[fn-60-P6030_1814772:735-nf] their own Maker, just as they had been accustomed to obey His servants also. Examine well the Exodus, Marcion; look at the rod of Moses, as it waves His command to the Red Sea, ampler than all the lakes of Judµa. How the sea yawns from its very depths, then fixes itself in two solidified masses, and so, out of the interval between them,[fn-60-P6031_1815128:736-nf] makes a way for the people to pass dry-shod across; again does the same rod vibrate, the sea returns in its strength, and in the concourse of its waters the chivalry of Egypt is engulphed! To that consummation the very winds subserved! Read, too, how that the Jordan was as a sword, to hinder the emigrant nation in their passage across its stream; how that its waters from above stood still, and its current below wholly ceased to run at the bidding of Joshua,[fn-60-P6032_1815641:737-nf] when his priests began to pass over![fn-60-P6033_1815702:738-nf] What will you say to this? If it be your Christ that is meant above, he will not be more potent than the servants of the Creator. But I should have been content with the examples I have adduced without addition,[fn-60-P6034_1816768:739-nf] if a prediction of His present passage on the sea had not preceded Christ's coming. As psalm is, in fact, accomplished by this[fn-60-P6035_1816909:740-nf] crossing over the lake. \"The Lord,\" says the psalmist, \"is upon many waters.\"[fn-60-P6036_1817001:741-nf] When He disperses its waves, Habakkuk's words are fulfilled, where he says, \"Scattering the waters in His passage.\"[fn-60-P6037_1817137:742-nf] When at His rebuke the sea is calmed, Nahum is also verified: He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry,\"[fn-60-P6038_1817290:743-nf] including the winds indeed, whereby it was disquieted. With what evidence would you have my Christ vindicated? Shall it come from the examples, or from the prophecies, of the Creator? You suppose that He is predicted as a military and armed warrior,[fn-60-P6039_1817558:744-nf] instead of one who in a figurative and allegorical sense was to wage a spiritual warfare against spiritual enemies, in spiritual campaigns, and with spiritual weapons: come now, when in one man alone you discover a multitude of demons calling itself Legion,[fn-60-P6040_1817856:745-nf] of course comprised of spirits, you should learn that Christ also must be understood to be an exterminator of spiritual foes, who wields spiritual arms and fights in spiritual strife; and that it was none other than He,[fn-60-P6041_1818098:746-nf] who now had to contend with even a legion of demons. Therefore it is of such a war as this that the Psalm may evidently have spoken: \"The Lord is strong, The Lord is mighty in battle.\"[fn-60-P6042_1818312:747-nf] For with the last enemy death did He fight, and through the trophy of the cross He triumphed. Now of what God did the Legion testify that Jesus was the Son?[fn-60-P6043_1818489:748-nf] No doubt, of that God whose torments and abyss they knew and dreaded. It seems impossible for them to have remained up to this time in ignorance of what the power of the recent and unknown god was working in the world, because it is very unlikely that the Creator was ignorant thereof. For if He had been at any time ignorant that there was another god above Himself, He had by this time at all events discovered that there was one at work[fn-60-P6044_1818951:749-nf] below His heaven. Now, what their Lord had discovered had by this time become notorious to His entire family within the same world and the same circuit of heaven, in which the strange deity dwelt and acted.[fn-60-P6045_1819174:750-nf] As therefore both the Creator and His creatures[fn-60-P6046_1819244:751-nf] must have had knowledge of him, if he had been in existence, so, inasmuch as he had no existence, the demons really knew none other than the Christ of their own God. They do not ask of the strange god, what they recollected they must beg of the Creator-not to be plunged into the Creator's abyss. They at last had their request granted. On what ground? Because they had lied? Because they had proclaimed Him to be the Son of a ruthless God? And what sort of god will that be who helped the lying, and upheld his detractors? However, no need of this thought, for,[fn-60-P6047_1819851:752-nf] inasmuch as they had not lied, inasmuch as they had acknowledged that the God of the abyss was also their God, so did He actually Himself affirm that He was the same whom these demons acknowledged-Jesus, the Judge and Son of the avenging God. Now, behold an inkling[fn-60-P6048_1820160:753-nf] of the Creator's failings[fn-60-P6049_1820202:754-nf] and infirmities in Christ; for I on my side[fn-60-P6050_1820269:755-nf] mean to impute to Him ignorance. Allow me some indulgence in my effort against the heretic. Jesus is touched by the woman who had an issue of blood,[fn-60-P6051_1820430:756-nf] He knew not by whom. \"Who touched me? \"He asks, when His disciples alleged an excuse. He even persists in His assertion of ignorance: \"Somebody hath touched me,\" He says, and advances some proof: \"For I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.\" What says our heretic? Could Christ have known the person? And why did He speak as if He were ignorant? Why? Surely it was to challenge her faith, and to try her fear. Precisely as He had once questioned Adam, as if in ignorance: Adam, where art thou? \"[fn-60-P6052_1820952:757-nf] Thus you have both the Creator excused in the same way as Christ, and Christ acting similarly to[fn-60-P6053_1821088:758-nf] the Creator. But in this case He acted as an adversary of the law; and therefore, as the law forbids contact with a woman with an issue,[fn-60-P6054_1821257:759-nf] He desired not only that this woman should touch Him, but that He should heal her.[fn-60-P6055_1821360:760-nf] Here, then, is a God who is not merciful by nature, but in hostility! Yet, if we find that such was the merit of this woman's faith, that He said unto her, Thy faith hath saved thee.\"[fn-60-P6056_1821577:761-nf] what are you, that you should detect an hostility to the law in that act, which the Lord Himself shows us to have been done as a reward of faith? But will you have it that this faith of the woman consisted in the contempt which she had acquired for the law? Who can suppose, that a woman who had been. hitherto unconscious of any God, uninitiated as yet in any new law, should violently infringe that law by which she was up to this time bound? On what faith, indeed, was such an infringement hazarded? In what God believing? Whom despising? The Creator? Her touch at least was an act of faith. And if of faith in the Creator, how could she have violated His law,[fn-60-P6057_1822263:762-nf] when she was ignorant of any other God? Whatever her infringement of the law amounted to, it proceeded from and was proportionate to her faith in the Creator. But how can these two things be compatible? That she violated the law, and violated it in faith, which ought to have restrained her from such violation? I will tell you how her faith was this above all:[fn-60-P6058_1822662:763-nf] it made her believe that her God preferred mercy even to sacrifice; she was certain that her God was working in Christ; she touched Him, therefore, nor as a holy man simply, nor as a prophet, whom she knew to be capable of contamination by reason of his human nature, but as very God, whom she assumed to be beyond all possibility of pollution by any uncleanness.[fn-60-P6059_1823040:764-nf] She therefore, not without reason,[fn-60-P6060_1823093:765-nf] interpreted for herself the law, as meaning that such things as are susceptible of defilement become defiled, but not so God, whom she knew for certain to be in Christ. But she recollected this also, that what came under the prohibition of the law[fn-60-P6061_1823360:766-nf] was that ordinary and usual issue of blood which proceeds from natural functions every month, and in childbirth, not that which was the result of disordered health. Her case, however, was one of long abounding[fn-60-P6062_1823593:767-nf] ill health, for which she knew that the succour of God's mercy was needed, and not the natural relief of time. And thus she may: evidently be regarded as having discerned[fn-60-P6063_1823794:768-nf] the law, instead of breaking it. This will prove to be the faith which was to confer intelligence likewise. \"If ye will not believe,\" says (the prophet), \"ye shall not understand.\"[fn-60-P6064_1823995:769-nf] When Christ approved of the faith of this woman, which simply rested in the Creator, He declared by His answer to her,[fn-60-P6065_1824134:770-nf] that He was Himself the divine object of the faith of which He approved. Nor can I overlook the fact that His garment, by being touched, demonstrated also the truth of His body; for of course\"[fn-60-P6066_1824349:771-nf] it was a body, and not a phantom, which the garment clothed.[fn-60-P6067_1824425:772-nf] This indeed is not our point now; but the remark has a natural bearing on the question we are discussing. For if it were not a veritable body, but only a fantastic one, it could not for certain have received contamination, as being an unsubstantial thing.[fn-60-P6068_1824749:773-nf] He therefore, who, by reason of this vacuity of his substance, was incapable of contamination, how could he possibly have desired this touch?[fn-60-P6069_1824913:774-nf] As an adversary of the law, his conduct was deceitful, for he was not susceptible of a real pollution.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":7,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"154","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"48. After these things, Matthew proceeds with his narrative in the following terms: \"And when Jesus was entered into Capharnaum, there came unto Him a centurion, beseeching Him, and saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, and he is grievously tormented;\" and so forth, on to the place where it is said, \"And his servant was healed in the self-same hour.\"[fn-16-P1635_670683:203-nf] This case of the centurion's servant is related also by Luke; only Luke does not bring it in, as Matthew does, after the cleansing of the leper, whose story he has recorded as something suggested to his recollection at a later stage, but introduces it after the conclusion of that lengthened sermon already discussed. For he connects the two sections in this way: \"Now when He had ended all His sayings in the audience of the people, He entered into Capharnaum; and a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick and ready to die;\" and so forth, until we come to the verse where it is said that he was healed.[fn-16-P1636_671334:204-nf] Here, then, we notice that it was not till after He had ended all His words in the hearing of the people that Christ entered Capharnaum; by which we are to understand simply that He did not make that entrance before He had brought these sayings to their conclusion; and we are not to take it as intimating the length of that period of time which intervened between the delivery of these discourses and the entrance into Capharnaum. In this interval that leper was cleansed, whose case is recorded by Matthew in its own proper place, but is given by Luke only at a later point.[fn-16-P1637_671934:205-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":7,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"155","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"49. Accordingly, let us proceed to consider whether Matthew and Luke are at one in the account of this servant. Matthew's words, then, are these: \"There came unto Him a centurion, beseeching Him, and saying, My servant lieth at home sick of the palsy.\"[fn-16-P1639_672221:206-nf] Now this seems to be inconsistent with the version presented by Luke, which runs thus: \"And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto Him the elders of the Jews, beseeching Him that He would come and healhis servant. And when they came to Jesus, they besought Him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom He should do this: for he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue. Then Jesus went with them. And when He was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying unto Him, Lord, trouble not Thyself; for I am not worthy that Thou shouldest enter under my roof: wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto Thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.\"[fn-16-P1640_672955:207-nf] For if this was the manner in which the incident took place, how can Matthew's statement, that there \"came to Him a certain centurion,\" be correct, seeing that the man did not come in person, but sent his friends? The apparent discrepancy, however, will disappear if we look carefully into the matter, and observe that Matthew has simply held by a very familiar mode of expression. For not only are we accustomed to speak of one as coming[fn-16-P1641_673416:208-nf] even before he actually reaches the place he is said to have approached,[fn-16-P1642_673521:209-nf] whence, too, we speak of one as making small approach or making great approach[fn-16-P1643_673628:210-nf] to what he is desirous of reaching; but we also not unfrequently speak of that access,[fn-16-P1644_673758:211-nf] for the sake of getting at which the approach is made, as reached even although the person who is said to reach another may not himself see the individual whom he reaches, inasmuch as it may be through a friend that he reaches the person whose favour is necessary to him. This, indeed, is a custom which has so thoroughly established itself, that even in the language of every-day life now those men are called Perventores[fn-16-P1645_674208:212-nf] who, in the practice of canvassing,[fn-16-P1646_674272:213-nf] get at the inaccessible ears, as one may say, of any of the men of influence, by the intervention of suitable personages. If, therefore, access[fn-16-P1647_674440:214-nf] itself is thus familiarly said to be gained by the means of other parties, how much more may an approach[fn-16-P1648_674563:215-nf] be said to take place, although it be by means of others, which always remains something short of actual access! For it is surely the case, that a person may be able to do very much in the way of approach, but yet may have failed to succeed in actually reaching what he sought to get at. Consequently it is nothing out of the way for Matthew,-a fact, indeed, which may be understood by any intelligence,-when thus dealing with an approach on the part of the centurion to the Lord, which was effected in the person of others, to have chosen to express the matter in this compendious method, \"There came a centurion to Him.\"","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":7,"verse":42,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"156","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"50. At the same time, however, we must be careful enough to discern a certain mystical depth in the phraseology adopted by the evangelist, which is in accordance with these words of the Psalm, \"Come ye to Him, and be ye lightened.\"[fn-16-P1650_675445:216-nf] For in this way, inasmuch as theLord Himself commended the faith of the centurion, in which indeed his approach was really made to Jesus, in such terms that He declared,\"I have not found so great faith in Israel,\" the evangelist wisely chose to speak of the man himself as coming to Jesus, rather than to bring in the persons through whom he had conveyed his words. And furthermore, Luke has unfolded the whole incident to us just as it occurred, in a form constraining us to understand from his narrative in what manner another writer, who was also incapable of making any false statement,might have spoken of the man himself as coming. It is in this way, too, that the woman who suffered from the issue of blood, although she took hold merely of the hem of His garment, did yet touch the Lord more effectually than those multitudes did by whom He was thronged.[fn-16-P1651_676362:217-nf] For just as she touched the Lord the more effectually, in so far as she believed the more earnestly, so the centurion also came the more really to the Lord, inasmuch as he believed the more thoroughly. And now, as regards the rest of this paragraph, it would be a superfluous task to go over in detail the various matters which are recounted by the one and omitted by the other. For, according to the principle brought under notice at the outset, there is not to be found in these peculiarities any actual antagonism between the writers.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":7,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":33,"source_paragraph":"195","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"78.

Wherefore a few witnesses, which the Lord deigns to suggest to my mind, I proceed to mention, from out the teaching of Christ concerning humility, such as perhaps may be enough for my purpose. His discourse, the first which He delivered to His disciples at greater length, began from this. \"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.\"[fn-39-P3985_1894979:81-nf] And these without all controversy we take to be humble. The faith of that Centurion He on this account chiefly praised, and said that He had not found in Israel so great faith, because he believed with so great humility as to say, \"I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof.\"[fn-39-P3986_1895286:82-nf] Whence also Matthew for no other reason said that he \"came\" unto Jesus, (whereas Luke most plainly signifies that he came not unto Him himself, but sent his friends,) save that by his most faithful humility he himself came unto Him more than they whom he sent. Whence also is that of the Prophet, \"The Lord is very high, and hath respect unto things that are lowly: but what are very high He noteth afar off;\"[fn-39-P3987_1895735:83-nf] assuredly as not coming unto Him. Whence also He saith to that woman of Canaan, \"O woman, great is thy faith; be it done unto thee as thou wilt;\"[fn-39-P3988_1895903:84-nf] whom above He had called a dog, and had made answer that the bread of the sons was not to be cast to her.

The Pharisee who sat at meat there, as though whole himself, blamed the Physician, and said within himself, \"This man, if he were a prophet, would have known what woman touched his feet.\" He suspected that He knew not, because He did not repulse her to prevent His being touched with unclean hands; but He did know, He permitted Himself to be touched, that the touch itself might heal.

For if there are two laws, the law in our members warring against the law of the mind, and the law of the mind,[fn-78-P7839_1658647:20-nf] we must say that the law of the mind-that is, the spiritual-is man, to whom the soul was given by God as wife, that is, to the man who is law, according to what is written, \"A wife is married to a man by God; \"[fn-78-P7840_1658877:21-nf] but the other is a paramour of the soul which is subject to it, which also on account of it is called an adulteress. Now that the law is husband of the soul Paul clearly exhibits in the Epistle to the Romans, saying, \"The law hath dominion over a man for so long time as he liveth; for the woman that hath a husband is bound to the husband while he liveth, to the husband who is law,\"[fn-78-P7841_1659283:22-nf] etc. For consider in these things that the law hath dominion over the man so long time as the law liveth,-as a husband over a wife. \"For the woman that hath a husband,\" that is, the soul under the law, \"is bound to the husband while he liveth,\" to the husband who is the law; but if the husband-that is, the law die-she is discharged from the law, which is her husband. Now the law dies to him who has gone up to the condition of blessedness, and no longer lives under the law, but acts like to Christ, who, though He became under law for the sake of those under law, that He might gain those under law,[fn-78-P7842_1660025:23-nf] did not continue under law, nor did He leave subject to law those who had been freed by Him; for He led them up along with Himself to the divine citizenship which is above the law, which contains, as for the imperfect and such as are still sinners, sacrifices for the remission of sins. He then who is without sin, and stands no longer in need of legal sacrifices, perhaps when he has become perfect has passed beyond even the spiritual law, and comes to the Word beyond it, who became flesh to those who live in the flesh, but to those who no longer at all war after the flesh, He is perceived as being the Word, as[fn-78-P7843_1660662:24-nf] He was God in the beginning with God, and reveals the Father. Three things therefore are to be thought of in connection with this place-the woman that hath a husband, who is under a husband-the law; and the woman who is an adulteress, to-wit, the soul, which, while her husband, the law, liveth, has become joined to another husband, namely, the law of the flesh; and the woman who is married to the brother of the dead husband, to the Word who is alive and dies not, who \"being raised from the dead dieth no more, for death hath no more dominion over Him.\"[fn-78-P7844_1661242:25-nf] So far then because of the saying, \"But if the husband die she is discharged from the law, the husband,\" and because of this, \"so then, while her husband liveth, she shall be called an adulteress, if she be joined to another man,\" and because of this, \"but if the husband die, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress though she be joined to another man.\"[fn-78-P7845_1661629:26-nf] But this very saying, \"So then while her husband liveth, she shall be called an adulteress,\" we have brought forward, wishing clearly to show why in answer to the Pharisees and Sadducees who were tempting Him and asking Him to show them a sign from heaven, He said not only \"a wicked generation,\" but an \"adulterous\" generation.[fn-78-P7846_1661979:27-nf] In a general way, then, the law in the members which wars against the law of the mind,[fn-78-P7847_1662085:28-nf] as a man who is an adulterer, is an adulterer of the soul. But now also every power that is hostile, which gains the mastery over the human soul, and has intercourse with it, commits adultery with her who had a bridegroom given to her by God, namely, the Word. After these things it is written that \"He left them and departed.\" For how was the bridegroom-the Word-not going to leave the adulterous generation and depart from it? But you might say that the Word of God, leaving the synagogue of the Jews as adulterous, departed from it, and took a wife of fornication,[fn-78-P7848_1662672:29-nf] namely, those from the Gentiles; since those who were \"Sion, a faithful city,\"[fn-78-P7849_1662767:30-nf] have become harlots; but these have become like the harlot Rahab, who received the spies of Joshua, and was saved with all her house;[fn-78-P7850_1662918:31-nf] after this no longer playing the harlot, but coming to the feet of Jesus, and wetting them with the tears of repentance, and anointing them with the fragrance of the ointment of holy conversation, on account of whom, reproaching Simon the leper,-the former people,-He spoke those things which are written.[fn-78-P7851_1663243:32-nf] ","title":"Book XII."},{"chapter":7,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_36_on_the_making_of_man","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"239","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"10. Still in addition to these acts He exceeds them in wonder, and by a more exalted act of power prepares for men the way of faith in the resurrection. The Scripture tells us of a city called Nain in Judaea: a widow there had an only child, no longer a child in the sense of being among boys, but already passing from childhood to man's estate: the narrative calls him \"a young man.\" The story conveys much in few words: the very recital is a real lamentation: the dead man's mother, it says, \"was a widow.\" See you the weight of her misfortune, how the text briefly sets out the tragedy of her suffering? for what does the phrase mean? that she had no more hope of bearing sons, to cure the loss she had just sustained in him who had departed; for the woman was a widow: she had not in her power to look to another instead of to him who was gone; for he was her only child; and how great a grief is here expressed any one may easily see who is not an utter stranger to natural feeling. Him alone she had known in travail him alone she had nursed at her breast; he alone made her table cheerful, he alone was the cause of brightness in her home, in play, in work, in learning, in gaiety, at processions, at sports, at gatherings of youth; he alone was all that is sweet and precious in a mother's eyes. Now at the age of marriage, he was the stock of her race, the shoot of its succession, the staff of her old age. Moreover, even the additional detail of his time of life is another lament: for he who speaks of him as \"a young man\" tells of the flower of his faded beauty, speaks of him as just covering his face with down, not yet with a full thick beard, but still bright with the beauty of his cheeks. What then, think you, were his mother's sorrows for him? how would her heart be consumed as it were with a flame; how bitterly would she prolong her lament over him, embracing the corpse as it lay before her, lengthening out her mourning for him as far as possible, so as not to hasten the funeral of the dead, but to have her fill of sorrow! Nor does the narrative pass this by: for Jesus \"when He saw her,\" it says, \"had compassion\"; \"and He came and touched the bier; and they that bare him stood still;\" and He said to the dead, \"Young man, I say unto thee, arise[fn-33-P3356_2183272:129-nf] \" \"and He delivered him to his mother\" alive.

And that which participates in eternity is wont to be assimilated to the incorruptible: so that to us appertains the designation of the age of childhood, a lifelong spring-time, because the truth that is in us, and our habits saturated with the truth, cannot be touched by old age; but Wisdom is ever blooming, ever remains consistent and the same, and never changes. \"Their children,\" it is said, \"shall be borne upon their shoulders, and fondled on their knees; as one whom his mother comforteth, so also shall I comfort you.\"[fn-33-P3369_1005538:44-nf] The mother draws the children to herself; and we seek our mother the Church. Whatever is feeble and tender, as needing help on account of its feebleness, is kindly looked on, and is sweet and pleasant, anger changing into help in the case of such: for thus horses' colts, and the little calves of cows, and the lion's whelp, and the stag's fawn, and the child of man, are looked upon with pleasure by their fathers and mothers. Thus also the Father of the universe cherishes affection towards those who have fled to Him; and having begotten them again by His Spirit to the adoption of children, knows them as gentle, and loves those alone, and aids and fights for them; and therefore He bestows on them the name of child. The word Isaac I also connect with child. Isaac means laughter. He was seen sporting with his wife and helpmeet Rebecca by the prying king.[fn-33-P3370_1006423:45-nf] The king, whose name was Abimelech, appears to me to represent a supramundane wisdom contemplating the mystery of sport. They interpret Rebecca to mean endurance. O wise sport, laughter also assisted by endurance, and the king as spectator! The spirit of those that are children in Christ, whose lives are ordered in endurance, rejoice. And this is the divine sport. \"Such a sport, of his own, Jove sports,\" says Heraclitus. For what other employment is seemly for a wise and perfect man, than to sport and be glad in the endurance of what is good-and, in the administration of what is good, holding festival with God? That which is signified by the prophet may be interpreted differently,-namely, of our rejoicing for salvation, as Isaac. He also, delivered from death, laughed, sporting and rejoicing with his spouse, who was the type of the Helper of our salvation, the Church, to whom the stable name of endurance is given; for this cause surely, because she alone remains to all generations, rejoicing ever, subsisting as she does by the endurance of us believers, who are the members of Christ. And the witness of those that have endured to the end, and the rejoicing on their account, is the mystic sport, and the salvation accompanied with decorous solace which brings us aid. The King, then, who is Christ, beholds from above our laughter, and looking through the window, as the Scripture says, views the thanksgiving, and the blessing, and the rejoicing, and the gladness, and furthermore the endurance which works together with them and their embrace: views His Church, showing only His face, which was wanting to the Church, which is made perfect by her royal Head. And where, then, was the door by which the Lord showed Himself? The flesh by which He was manifested. He is Isaac (for the narrative may be interpreted otherwise), who is a type of the Lord, a child as a son; for he was the son of Abraham, as Christ the Son of God, and a sacrifice as the Lord, but he was not immolated as the Lord. Isaac only bore the wood of the sacrifice, as the Lord the wood of the cross. And he laughed mystically, prophesying that the Lord should fill us with joy, who have been redeemed from corruption by the blood of the Lord. Isaac did everything but suffer, as was right, yielding the precedence in suffering to the Word. Furthermore, there is an intimation of the divinity of the Lord in His not being slain. For Jesus rose again after His burial, having suffered no harm, like Isaac released from sacrifice. And in defence of the point to be established, I shall adduce another consideration of the greatest weight. The Spirit calls the Lord Himself a child, thus prophesying by Esaias: \"Lo, to us a child has been born, to us a son has been given, on whose own shoulder the government shall be; and His name has been called the Angel of great Counsel.\" Who, then, is this infant child? He according to whose image we are made little children.

And so both the apostles and all the servants of God\nnever did any thing in their own name, but in the name and invocation of Christ: for the power itself\nderived its force from the same source as its origin, and could not be given through the\ninstrumentality of the ministers, unless it had come from the Author.

And she had a son, a dealer in unguents, and she gave it to him, saying: See that thou do not sell this jar of unguent of nard, even although three hundred denarii[fn-64-P6490_1932450:5-nf] should be offered thee for it. And this is that jar which Mary the sinner bought and poured upon the head and feet of our Lord Jesus Christ, which thereafter she wiped with the hair of her head.[fn-64-P6491_1932700:6-nf] Ten days after, they took Him to Jerusalem; and on the fortieth day[fn-64-P6492_1932789:7-nf] after His birth they carried Him into the temple, and set Him before the Lord, and offered sacrifices for Him, according to the command-meet of the law of Moses, which is: Every male that openeth the womb shall be called the holy of God.[fn-64-P6493_1933043:8-nf] ","title":"The Arabic Gospel of the Infancy of the Saviour","author":"Apocrypha of the New Testament"}]
