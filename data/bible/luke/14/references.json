But it is rather that statement which the Lord Himself makes in another passage which is wont to disturb the minds of the little ones, who nevertheless earnestly desire to live now according to the precepts of Christ: \"If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.\"[fn-4-P417_115810:131-nf] For it may seem a contradiction to the less intelligent, that here He forbids the putting away of a wife saving for the cause of fornication, but that elsewhere He affirms that no one can be a disciple of His who does not hate his wife. But if He were speaking with reference to sexual intercourse, He would not place father, and mother, and brothers in the same category. But how true it is, that \"the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and they that use violence take it by force!\"[fn-4-P418_116318:132-nf] For how great violence is necessary, in order that a man may love his enemies, and hate his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers! For He commands both things who calls us to the kingdom of heaven. And how these things do not contradict each other, it is easy to show under His guidance; but after they have been understood, it is difficult to carry them out, although this too is very easy when He Himself assists us. For in that eternal kingdom to which He has vouchsafed to call His disciples, to whom He also gives the name of brothers, there are no temporal relationships of this sort. For \"there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female;\" \"but Christ is all, and in all.\"[fn-4-P419_117152:133-nf] And the Lord Himself says: \"For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage,[fn-4-P420_117289:134-nf] but are as the angels of God in heaven.\"[fn-4-P421_117371:135-nf] Hence it is necessary that whoever wishes here and now to aim after the life of that kingdom, should hate not the persons themselves, but those temporal relationships by which this life of ours, which is transitory and is comprised in being born and dying, is upheld; because he who does not hate them, does not yet love that life where there is no condition of being born and dying, which unites parties in earthly wedlock.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":14,"verse":26,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_07_book_i_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"83","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"42. A Christian may therefore live in concord with his wife, whether with her providing for a fleshly craving, a thing which the apostle speaks by permission, not by commandment; or providing for the procreation of children, which may be at present in some degree praiseworthy; or providing for a brotherly and sisterly fellowship, without any corporeal connection, having his wife as though he had her not, as is most excellent and sublime in the marriage of Christians: yet so that in her he hates the name of temporal relationship, and loves the hope of everlasting blessedness. For we hate, without doubt, that respecting which we wish at least, that at some time hereafter it should not exist; as, for instance, this same life of ours in the present world, which if we were not to hate as being temporal, we would not long for the future life, which is not conditioned by time. For as a substitute for this life the soul is put, respecting which it is said in that passage, \"If a man hate not his own soul[fn-4-P425_121101:137-nf] also, he cannot be my disciple.\" For that corruptible meat is necessary for this life, of which the Lord Himself says, \"Is not the soul[fn-4-P426_121258:138-nf] more than meat?\" i.e. this life to which meat is necessary.

Is it not plainly this? that each foresees the danger which would attend his incompetence? Well, where the loss is concerned with trifles shall we use so much forethought, and refuse to yield to the pressure of compulsion, but where the punishment is eternal, as it is for those who know not how to handle the Priesthood, shall we want only and inconsiderately run into so great danger, and then advance, as our excuse, the pressing entreaties of others? But He who one day will judge us will entertain no such plea as this. For we ought to show far more caution in spiritual matters than in carnal. But now we are not found exhibiting as much caution. For tell me: if supposing a man to be an artificer, when he is not so, we invited him to do a piece of work, and he were to respond to the call, and then having set his hand to the material prepared for the building, were to spoil the wood and spoil the stone, and so to build the house that it straightway fell to pieces, would it be sufficient excuse for him to allege that he had been urged by others and did not come of his own accord? in no wise; and very reasonably and justly so. For he ought to have refused even at the call of others. So for the man who only spoils wood and stone, there will be no escape from paying the penalty, and is he who destroys souls, and builds the temple of God carelessly, to think that the compulsion of others is his warrant for escaping punishment? Is not this very absurd? For I omit the fact as yet that no one is able to compel the man who is unwilling. But be it that he was subjected to excessive pressure and divers artful devices, and then fell into a snare; will this therefore rescue him from punishment? I beseech thee, let us not deceive ourselves, and pretend that we know not what is obvious to a mere child. For surely this pretence of ignorance will not be able to profit in the day of reckoning. Thou wert not ambitious, thou sayest, of receiving this high office, conscious of thine own weakness. Well and good. Then thou oughtest, with the same mind, to have declined the solicitation of others; or, when no one called thee, wast thou weak and incapable, but when those were found ready to offer thee this dignity, didst thou suddenly become competent? What ludicrous nonsense! worthy of the extremest punishment. For this reason also the Lord counsels the man who wishes to build a tower, not to lay the foundation before he has taken his own ability to build into account, lest he should give the passers by innumerable opportunities of mocking at him.[fn-4-P463_231666:19-nf] But in his case the penalty only consists in becoming a laughing-stock; while in that before us the punishment is that of fire unquenchable, and of an undying worm,[fn-4-P464_231858:20-nf] gnashing of teeth, outer darkness, and being cut asunder,[fn-4-P465_231935:21-nf] and having a portion with the hypocrites.","title":"Book IV.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":14,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_17_the_epistle_of_ignatius_to_the_magnesians","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"57","folder":"ANF-01","text":"May I enjoy you in all respects, if indeed I be worthy!

From this his conversation turned to the companies in the monasteries, and their manners so fragrant unto Thee, and of the fruitful deserts of the wilderness, of which we knew nothing.

And these were of the body called \"Agents for Public Affairs.\"[fn-12-P1240_522260:70-nf] Then, suddenly being overwhelmed with a holy love and a sober sense of shame, in anger with himself, he cast his eyes upon his friend, exclaiming, \"Tell me, I entreat thee, what end we are striving for by all these labours of ours. What is our aim? What is our motive in doing service? Can our hopes in court rise higher than to be ministers of the emperor? And in such a position, what is there not brittle, and fraught with danger, and by how many dangers arrive we at greater danger? And when arrive we thither? But if I desire to become a friend of God, behold, I am even now made it.\" Thus spake he, and in the pangs of the travail of the new life, he turned his eyes again upon the page and continued reading, and was inwardly changed where Thou sawest, and his mind was divested of the world, as soon became evident; for as he read, and the surging of his heart rolled along, he raged awhile, discerned and resolved on a better course, and now, having become Thine, he said to his friend, \"Now have I broken loose from those hopes of ours, and am determined to serve God; and this, from this hour, in this place, I enter upon. If thou art reluctant to imitate me, hinder me not.\" The other replied that he would cleave to him, to share in so great a reward and so great a service. Thus both of them, being now Thine, were building a tower at the necessary cost,[fn-12-P1241_524239:71-nf] -of forsaking all that they had and following Thee. Then Pontitianus, and he that had walked with him through other parts of the garden, came in search of them to the same place, and having found them, reminded them to return as the day had declined. But they, making known to him their resolution and purpose, and how such a resolve had sprung up and become confirmed in them, entreated them not to molest them, if they refused to join themselves unto them. But the others, no whir changed from their former selves, did yet (as he said) bewail themselves, and piously congratulated them, recommending themselves to their prayers; and with their hearts inclining towards earthly things, returned to the palace.

Certainly amongst them that have been born of women, there has not arisen a greater than John the Baptist. But the term greater implies others who are less. And[fn-68-P6853_2182451:232-nf] \"he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.\" You see then that in heaven one is greatest and another is least, and that among the angels and the invisible creation there is a manifold and infinite diversity. Why do the apostles say:[fn-68-P6854_2182724:233-nf] \"Lord, increase our faith,\" if there is one measure for all?

The secret is disclosed in the Gospel:[fn-68-P6858_2183782:237-nf] \"Whosoever shall do and teach, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall teach, and not do, shall be least.\"[fn-68-P6859_2183943:238-nf] The Saviour taught us at a feast to take the lowest place, lest, when one greater than us came, we should be thrust with disgrace from the higher place.

Consider also to which deity[fn-65-P6575_1932763:1246-nf] is better suited the parable of him who issued invitations: \"A certain man made a great supper, and bade many.\"[fn-65-P6576_1932895:1247-nf] The preparation for the supper is no doubt a figure of the abundant provision[fn-65-P6577_1932996:1248-nf] of eternal life. I first remark, that strangers, and persons unconnected by ties of relationship, are not usually invited to a supper; but that members of the household and family are more frequently the favoured guests. To the Creator, then, it belonged to give the invitation, to whom also appertained those who were to be invited-whether considered as men, through their descent from Adam, or as Jews, by reason of their fathers; not to him who possessed no claim to them either by nature or prerogative. My next remark is,[fn-65-P6578_1933545:1249-nf] if He issues the invitations who has prepared the supper, then, in this sense the supper is the Creator's, who sent to warn the guests. These had been indeed previously invited by the fathers, but were to be admonished by the prophets. It certainly is not the feast of him who never sent a messenger to warn-who never did a thing before towards issuing an invitation, but came down himself on a sudden-only then[fn-65-P6579_1933974:1250-nf] beginning to be known, when already[fn-65-P6580_1934036:1251-nf] giving his invitation; only then inviting, when already compelling to his banquet; appointing one and the same hour both for the supper and the invitation. But when invited, they excuse themselves.[fn-65-P6581_1934260:1252-nf] And fairly enough, if the invitation came from the other god, because it was so sudden; if, however, the excuse was not a fair one, then the invitation was not a sudden one. Now, if the invitation was not a sudden one, it must have been given by the Creator-even by Him of old time, whose call they had at last refused. They first refused it when they said to Aaron, \"Make us gods, which shall go before us; \"[fn-65-P6582_1934693:1253-nf] and again, afterwards, when \"they heard indeed with the ear, but did not understand\"[fn-65-P6583_1934801:1254-nf] their calling of God. In a manner most germane[fn-65-P6584_1934870:1255-nf] to this parable, He said by Jeremiah: \"Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people; and ye shall walk in all my ways, which I have commanded you.\"[fn-65-P6585_1935064:1256-nf] This is the invitation of God. \"But,\" says He, \"they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear.\"[fn-65-P6586_1935180:1257-nf] This is the refusal of the people. \"They departed, and walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart.\"[fn-65-P6587_1935316:1258-nf] \"I have bought a field-and I have bought some oxen-and I have married a wife.\"[fn-65-P6588_1935416:1259-nf] And still He urges them: \"I have sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early even before day-light.\"[fn-65-P6589_1935556:1260-nf] The Holy Spirit is here meant, the admonisher of the guests. \"Yet my people hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck.\"[fn-65-P6590_1935768:1261-nf] This was reported to the Master of the family.

I now appeal to the Gospels. But here also I must first meet the same sophistry as advanced by those who contend that the Lord, like (the prophets), said everything in the way of allegory, because it is written: \"All these things spake Jesus in parables, and without a parable spake He not unto them,\"[fn-100-P10000_2771947:222-nf] \nthat is, to the Jews. Now the disciples also asked Him, \"Why speakest Thou in\nparables?\"  And\nthe Lord gave them this answer: \"Therefore I speak unto them in parables:\nbecause they seeing, see not; and hearing, they hear not, according to the\nprophecy of Esaias.\" \n But since it was to the Jews that He spoke in parables, it was not then to all\nmen; and if not to all, it follows that it was not always and in all things\nparables with Him, but only in certain things, and when addressing a particular\nclass. But He addressed a particular class when He spoke to the Jews. It is true\nthat He spoke sometimes even to the disciples in parables. But observe how the\nScripture relates such a fact:  \"And He spake a parable unto them.\" \n It follows, then, that He did not usually address them in parables; because if\nHe always did so, special mention would not be made of His resorting to this\nmode of address. Besides, there is not a parable which you will not find to be\neither explained by the Lord Himself, as that of the sower, (which He\ninterprets) of the management of the word of God; \n or else cleared by a preface from the writer of the Gospel, as in the parable\nof the arrogant judge and the importunate widow, which is expressly applied\nto earnestness in prayer; or capable of being spontaneously understood, \n as in the parable of the fig-tree, which was spared a while in hopes of\nimprovement�an emblem of Jewish sterility.  Now, if even parables obscure\nnot the light of the gospel, how unlikely it is that plain sentences and\ndeclarations, which have an unmistakeable meaning, should signify any other\nthing than their literal sense! But it is by such declarations and sentences\nthat the Lord sets forth either the last judgment, or the kingdom, or the\nresurrection: \"It shall be more tolerable,\" He says, \"for Tyre and Sidon in the\nday of judgment than for you.\" \n And \"Tell them that the kingdom of God is at hand.\"\n And again, \"It shall be recompensed to you at the resurrection of the just.\" Now, if the mention of these events (I mean the judgment-day, and the kingdom of God, and the resurrection) has a plain and absolute sense, so that nothing about them can be pressed into an allegory, neither should those statements be forced into parables which describe the arrangement, and the process, and the experience of the kingdom of God, and of the judgment, and of the resurrection. On the contrary, things which are destined for the body should be carefully understood in a bodily sense,-not in a spiritual sense, as having nothing figurative in their nature. This is the reason why we have laid it down as a preliminary consideration, that the bodily substance both of the soul and of the flesh is liable to the recompense, which will have to be awarded in return for the co-operation of the two natures, that so the corporeality of the soul may not exclude the bodily nature of the flesh by suggesting a recourse to figurative descriptions, since both of them must needs be regarded as destined to take part in the kingdom, and the judgment, and the resurrection. And now we proceed to the special proof of this proposition, that the bodily character of the flesh is indicated by our Lord whenever He mentions the resurrection, at the same time without disparagement to the corporeal nature of the soul,-a point which has been actually admitted but by a few.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":14,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_32_book_i_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"62","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"30.

God forbid that this should be your case; but yet you have treated me (how shall I put it gently?) with as much haughtiness or boldness as they who after being called to a feast rise up against it, and insult their host; for you, though you are not of the number of those who are without, or are invited to the marriage, but are yourselves those who invited me, and bound me to the Holy Table, and shewed me the glory of the Bridal Chamber, then deserted me (this is the most splendid thing about you)-one to his field, another to his newly bought yoke of oxen, another to his just-married wife, another to some other trifling matter; you were all scattered and dispersed, caring little for the Bridechamber and the Bridegroom.[fn-35-P3517_987378:5-nf] ","title":"Oration III.","author":"Gregory Nazianzen"},{"chapter":14,"verse":28,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_41_sixth_book","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"41","folder":"ANF-10","text":"When a house is being built which is to be made as strong as possible, the building takes place in fine weather and in calm, so that nothing may hinder the structure from acquiring the needed solidity. And thus it turns out so strong and stable that it is able to withstand the rush of the flood. and the dashing of the river, and all the agencies accompanying a storm which are apt to find out what is rotten in a building and to show what parts of it have been properly put together. And more particularly should that house which is capable of sheltering the speculations of truth, the house of reason, as it were, in promise or in letters, be built at a time when God can add His free co-operation to the projector of so noble a work, when the soul is quiet and in the enjoyment of that peace which passes all understanding, when she is turned away from all disturbance and not buffeted by any billows. This, it appears to me, was well understood by the servants of the prophetic spirit and the ministers of the Gospel message; they made themselves worthy to receive that peace which is in secret from Him who ever gives it to them that are worthy and who said,[fn-66-P6694_1177399:1-nf] \"Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth give I unto you.\" And look if some similar lesson is not taught under the surface with regard to David and Solomon in the narrative about the temple. David, who fought the wars of the Lord and stood firm against many enemies, his own and those of Israel, desired to build a temple for God. But God, through Nathan, prevents him from doing so, and Nathan says to him,[fn-66-P6695_1177858:2-nf] \"Thou shalt not build me an house, because thou art a man of blood.\" But Solomon, on the other hand, saw God in a dream, and in a dream received wisdom, for the reality of the vision was kept for him who said, \"Behold a greater than Solomon is here.\" The time was one of the profoundest peace, so that it was possible for every man to rest under his own vine and his own fig-tree, and Solomon's very name was significant of the peace which was in his days, for Solomon means peaceful; and so he was at liberty to build the famous temple of God. About the time of Ezra, also, when \"truth conquers wine and the hostile king: and women,\"[fn-66-P6696_1178517:3-nf] the temple of God is restored again. All this is said by way of apology to you, reverend Ambrosius. It is at your sacred encouragement that I have made up my mind to build up in writing: the tower of the Gospel; and I have therefore sate down to count the cost,[fn-66-P6697_1178807:4-nf] if I have sufficient to finish it, lest I should be mocked by the beholders, because I laid the foundation but was not able to finish the work. The result of my counting, it is true, has been that I do not possess what is required to finish it; yet I have put my trust in God, who enriches us[fn-66-P6698_1179117:5-nf] with all wisdom and all knowledge. If we strive to keep His spiritual laws we believe that He does enrich us; He will supply what is necessary so that we shall get on with our building, and shall even come to the parapet of the structure. That parapet it is which keeps from falling those who go up on the house of the Word; for people only fall off those houses which have no parapet, so that the buildings themselves are to blame for their fall and for their death. We proceeded as far as the fifth volume in spite of the obstacles presented by the storm in Alexandria, and spoke what was given us to speak, for Jesus rebuked the winds and the waves of the sea. We emerged from the storm, we were brought out of Egypt, that God delivering us who led His people forth from there. Then, when the enemy assailed us with all bitterness by his new writings, so directly hostile to the Gospel, and stirred up against us all the winds of wickedness in Egypt, I felt that reason called me rather to stand fist for the conflict, and to save the higher part in me, lest evil counsels should succeed in directing the storm so as to overwhelm my soul, rather to do this than to finish my work at an unsuitable season, before my mind had recovered its calm. Indeed, the ready writers who usually attended me brought my work to a stand by failing to appear to take down my words. But now that the many fiery darts directed against me have lost their edge, for God extinguished them, and my soul has grown accustomed to the dispensation sent me for the sake of the heavenly word, and has learned from necessity to disregard the snares of my enemies, it is as if a great calm had settled on me, and Idefer no longer the continuation of this work. I pray that God will be with me, and will speak as a teacher in the porch of my soul, so that the building I have begun of the exposition of the Gospel of John may arrive at completion. May God hear my prayer and grant that the body of the whole work may now be brought together, and that no interruption may intervene which might prevent me from following the sequence of Scripture. And be assured that it is with great readiness that I now make this second beginning and enter on my sixth volume, because what I wrote before at Alexandria has not, I know not by what chance, been brought with me. I feared I might neglect this work, if I were not engaged on it at once, and therefore thought it better to make use of this present time and begin without delay the part which remains. I am not certain if the part formerly written will come to light, and would be very unwilling to waste time in waiting to see if it does. Enough of preamble, let us now attend to our text.","title":"Sixth Book","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":14,"verse":26,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_45_scorpiace_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"42","folder":"ANF-03","text":"In the same manner, therefore, we maintain that the other announcements too refer to the condition of martyrdom. \"He,\" says Jesus, \"who will value his own life also more than me, is not worthy of me,\"[fn-110-P11064_3138399:72-nf] -that is, he who will rather live by denying, than die by confessing, me; and \"he who findeth his life shall lose it; but he who loseth it for my sake shall find it.\"[fn-110-P11065_3138585:73-nf] Therefore indeed he finds it, who, in winning life, denies; but he who thinks that he wins it by denying, will lose it in hell. On the other hand, he who, through confessing, is killed, will lose it for the present, but is also about to find it unto everlasting life. In fine, governors themselves, when they urge men to deny, say, \"Save your life; \"and, \"Do not lose your life.\" How would Christ speak, but in accordance with the treatment to which the Christian would be subjected? But when He forbids thinking about what answer to make at a judgment-seat,[fn-110-P11066_3139162:74-nf] He is preparing His own servants for what awaited them, He gives the assurance that the Holy Spirit will answer by them; and when He wishes a brother to be visited in prison,[fn-110-P11067_3139355:75-nf] He is commanding that those about to confess be the object of solicitude; and He is soothing their sufferings when He asserts that God will avenge His own elect.[fn-110-P11068_3139538:76-nf] In the parable also of the withering of the word[fn-110-P11069_3139607:77-nf] after the green blade had sprung up, He is drawing a picture with reference to the burning heat of persecutions. If these announcements are not understood as they are made, without doubt they signify something else than the sound indicates; and there will be one thing in the words, another in their meanings, as is the case with allegories, with parables, with riddles. Whatever wind of reasoning, therefore, these scorpions may catch (in their sails), with whatever subtlety they may attack, there is now one line of defence:[fn-110-P11070_3140155:78-nf] an appeal will be made to the facts themselves, whether they occur as the Scriptures represent that they would; since another thing will then be meant in the Scriptures if that very one (which seems to be so) is not found in actual facts. For what is written, must needs come to pass. Besides, what is written will then come to pass, if something different does not. But, lo! we are both regarded as persons to be hated by all men for the, sake of the name, as it is written; and are delivered up by our nearest of kin also, as it is written; and are brought before magistrates, and examined, and tortured, and make confession, and are ruthlessly killed, as it is written. So the Lord ordained. If He ordained these events otherwise, why do they not come to pass otherwise than He ordained them, that is, as He ordained them? And yet they do not come to pass otherwise than He ordained. Therefore, as they come to pass, so He ordained; and as He ordained, so they come to pass. For neither would they have been permitted to occur otherwise than He ordained, nor for His part would He have ordained otherwise than He would wish them to occur. Thus these passages of Scripture will not mean ought else than we recognise in actual facts; or if those events are not yet taking place which are announced, how are those taking place which have not been announced? For these events which are taking place have not been announced, if those which are announced are different, and not these which are taking place. Well now, seeing the very occurrences are met with in actual life which are believed to have been expressed with a different meaning in words, what would happen if they were found to have come to pass in a different manner than had been revealed? But this will be the waywardness of faith, not to believe what has been demonstrated, to assume the truth of what has not been demonstrated. And to this waywardness I will offer the following objection also, that if these events, which occur as is written, will not be the very ones which are announced, those too (which are meant) ought not to occur as is written, that they themselves also may not, after the example of these others, be in danger of exclusion, since there is one thing in the words and another in the facts; and there remains that even the events which have been announced are not seen when they occur, if they are announced otherwise than they have to occur. And how will those be believed (to have come to pass), which will not have been announced as they come to pass? Thus heretics, by not believing what is announced as it has been shown to have taken place, believe what has not been even announced.","title":"Scorpiace.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":14,"verse":26,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_41_homily_xxxv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"\"And why speak I,\" saith He, \"of friends and kinsmen? Even if it be thine own life which thou preferrest to my love, thy place is far from my disciples.\" What then? Are not these things contrary to the Old Testament? Far from it, rather they are very much in harmony therewith. For there too He commands not only to hate the worshippers of idols, but even to stone them; and in Deuteronomy again, admiring these, He saith, \"Who said unto his father, and to his mother, I have not seen thee; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, and his own sons he disowned: he kept Thy oracles.\"[fn-35-P3581_1153609:15-nf] And if Paul gives many directions touching parents, commanding us to obey them in all things, marvel not; for in those things only doth he mean us to obey, as many as do not hinder godliness.[fn-35-P3582_1153824:16-nf] For indeed it is a sacred duty to render them all other honors: but when they demand more than is due, one ought not to obey. For this reason Luke saith, \"If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple;\"[fn-35-P3583_1154236:17-nf] not commanding simply to hate them, since this were even quite contrary to the law; but \"when one desires to be loved more than I am, hate him in this respect. For this ruins both the beloved himself, and the lover.\" And these things He said, both to render the children more determined, and to make the fathers more gentle, that would hinder them. For when they saw He had such strength and power as to sever their children from them, they, as attempting things impossible, would even desist. Wherefore also He leaves the fathers, and addresses His discourse to the children, instructing the former not to make the attempt, as attempting things impracticable.","title":"Homily XXXV.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":14,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_47_book_iii_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"39","folder":"ANF-04","text":"12.

It is of advantage to each one, that he perceive his own peculiar nature[fn-69-P6930_1480189:129-nf] and the grace of God. For he who does not perceive his own weakness and the divine favour, although he receive a benefit, yet, not having made trial of himself, nor having condemned himself, will imagine that the benefit conferred upon him by the grace of Heaven is his own doing.

Besides these, they purchase birds from Phasis, the Egyptian snipes, and the Median peafowl. Altering these by means of condiments, the gluttons gape for the sauces. \"Whatever earth and the depths of the sea, and the unmeasured space of the air produce,\" they cater for their gluttony. In their greed and solicitude, the gluttons seem absolutely to sweep the world with a drag-net to gratify their luxurious tastes. These gluttons, surrounded with the sound of hissing frying-pans, and wearing their whole life away at the pestle and mortar, cling to matter like fire. More than that, they emasculate plain food, namely bread, by straining off the nourishing part of the grain, so that the necessary part of food becomes matter of reproach to luxury. There is no limit to epicurism among men. For it has driven them to sweetmeats, and honey-cakes, and sugar-plums; inventing a multitude of desserts, hunting after all manner of dishes. A man like this seems to me to be all jaw, and nothing else. \"Desire not,\" says the Scripture, \"rich men's dainties; \"[fn-37-P3713_1124578:1-nf] for they belong to a false and base life. They partake of luxurious dishes, which a little after go to the dunghill. But we who seek the heavenly bread must role the belly, which is beneath heaven, and much more the things which are agreeable to it, which \"God shall destroy,\"[fn-37-P3714_1124874:2-nf] says the apostle, justly execrating gluttonous desires. For \"meats are for the belly,\"[fn-37-P3715_1124979:3-nf] for on them depends this truly carnal and destructive life; whence[fn-37-P3716_1125064:4-nf] some, speaking with unbridled tongue, dare to apply the name agape,[fn-37-P3717_1125165:5-nf] to pitiful suppers, redolent of savour and sauces. Dishonouring the good and saving work of the Word, the consecrated agape, with pots and pouring of sauce; and by drink and delicacies and smoke desecrating that name, they are deceived in their idea, having expected that the promise of God might be bought with suppers. Gatherings for the sake of mirth, and such entertainments as are called by ourselves, we name rightly suppers, dinners, and banquets, after the example of the Lord. But such entertainments the Lord has not called agapae. He says accordingly somewhere, \"When thou art called to a wedding, recline not on the highest couch; but when thou art called, fall into the lowest place; \"[fn-37-P3718_1126057:6-nf] and elsewhere, \"When thou makest a dinner or a supper; \"and again, \"But when thou makest an entertainment, call the poor,\"[fn-37-P3719_1126200:7-nf] for whose sake chiefly a supper ought to be made. And further, \"A certain man made a great supper, and called many.\"[fn-37-P3720_1126338:8-nf] But I perceive whence the specious appellation of suppers flowed: \"from the gullets and furious love for suppers\"-according to the comic poet. For, in truth, \"to many, many things are on account of the supper.\" For they have not yet learned that God has provided for His creature (man I mean) food and drink, for sustenance, not for pleasure; since the body derives no advantage from extravagance in viands. For, quite the contrary, those who use the most frugal fare are the strongest and the healthiest, and the noblest; as domestics are healthier and stronger than their masters, and husbandmen than the proprietors; and not only more robust, but wiser, as philosophers are wiser than rich men. For they have not buried the mind beneath food, nor deceived it with pleasures. But love (agape) is in truth celestial food, the banquet of reason. \"It beareth all things, endureth all things, hopeth all things. Love never faileth.\"[fn-37-P3721_1127286:9-nf] \"Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.\"[fn-37-P3722_1127368:10-nf] But the hardest of all cases is for charity, which faileth not, to be cast from heaven above to the ground into the midst of sauces. And do you imagine that I am thinking of a supper that is to be done away with? \"For if,\" it is said, \"I bestow all my goods, and have not love, I am nothing.\"[fn-37-P3723_1127680:11-nf] On this love alone depend the law and the Word; and if \"thou shalt love the Lord thy God and thy neighbour,\" this is the celestial festival in the heavens. But the earthly is called a supper, as has been shown from Scripture. For the supper is made for love, but the supper is not love (agape); only a proof of mutual and reciprocal kindly feeling. \"Let not, then, your good be evil spoken of; for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink,\" says the apostle, in order that the meal spoken of may not be conceived as ephemeral, \"but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-37-P3724_1128287:12-nf] He who eats of this meal, the best of all, shall possess the kingdom of God, fixing his regards here on the holy assembly of love, the heavenly Church. Love, then, is something pure and worthy of God, and its work is communication. \"And the care of discipline is love,\" as Wisdom says; \"and love is the keeping of the law.\"[fn-37-P3725_1128634:13-nf] And these joys have an inspiration of love from the public nutriment, which accustoms to everlasting dainties. Love (agape), then, is not a supper. But let the entertainment depend on love. For it is said, \"Let the children whom Thou hast loved, O Lord, learn that it is not the products of fruits that nourish man; but it is Thy word which preserves those who believe on Thee.\"[fn-37-P3726_1129036:14-nf] \"For the righteous shall not live by bread.\"[fn-37-P3727_1129101:15-nf] But let our diet be light and digestible, and suitable for keeping awake, unmixed with diverse varieties. Nor is this a point which is beyond the sphere of discipline. For love is a good nurse for communication; having as its rich provision sufficiency, which, presiding over diet measured in due quantity, and treating the body in a healthful way, distributes something from its resources to those near us, But the diet which exceeds sufficiency injures a man, deteriorates his spirit, and renders his body prone to disease. Besides, those dainty tastes, which trouble themselves about rich dishes drive to practices of ill-repute, daintiness, gluttony, greed, voracity, insatiability. Appropriate designations of such people as so indulge are flies, weasels, flatterers, gladiators, and the monstrous tribes of parasites-the one class surrendering reason, the other friendship, and the other life, for the gratification of the belly; crawling on their bellies, beasts in human shape after the image of their father, the voracious beast. People first called the abandoneda0sw/touj, and so appear to me to indicate their end, understanding them as those who are (a0sw/souj) unsaved, excluding the j. For those that are absorbed in pots, and exquisitely prepared niceties of condiments, are they not plainly abject, earth-born, leading an ephemeral kind of life, as if they were not to live [hereafter]? Those the Holy Spirit, by Isaiah, denounces as wretched, depriving them tacitly of the name of love (agape), since their feasting was not in accordance with the word. \"But they made mirth, killing calves, and sacrificing sheep, saying, Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.\" And that He reckons such luxury to be sin, is shown by what He adds, \"And your sin shall not be forgiven you till you die,\"[fn-37-P3728_1130943:16-nf] -not conveying the idea that death, which deprives of sensation, is the forgiveness of sin, but meaning that death of salvation which is the recompense of sin. \"Take no pleasure in abominable delicacies, says Wisdom.[fn-37-P3729_1131184:17-nf] At this point, too, we have to advert to what are called things sacrificed to idols, in order to show how we are enjoined to abstain from them.

More than that, they emasculate plain food, namely bread, by straining off the nourishing part of the grain, so that the necessary part of food becomes matter of reproach to luxury. There is no limit to epicurism among men. For it has driven them to sweetmeats, and honey-cakes, and sugar-plums; inventing a multitude of desserts, hunting after all manner of dishes. A man like this seems to me to be all jaw, and nothing else. \"Desire not,\" says the Scripture, \"rich men's dainties; \"[fn-37-P3713_1124578:1-nf] for they belong to a false and base life. They partake of luxurious dishes, which a little after go to the dunghill. But we who seek the heavenly bread must role the belly, which is beneath heaven, and much more the things which are agreeable to it, which \"God shall destroy,\"[fn-37-P3714_1124874:2-nf] says the apostle, justly execrating gluttonous desires. For \"meats are for the belly,\"[fn-37-P3715_1124979:3-nf] for on them depends this truly carnal and destructive life; whence[fn-37-P3716_1125064:4-nf] some, speaking with unbridled tongue, dare to apply the name agape,[fn-37-P3717_1125165:5-nf] to pitiful suppers, redolent of savour and sauces. Dishonouring the good and saving work of the Word, the consecrated agape, with pots and pouring of sauce; and by drink and delicacies and smoke desecrating that name, they are deceived in their idea, having expected that the promise of God might be bought with suppers. Gatherings for the sake of mirth, and such entertainments as are called by ourselves, we name rightly suppers, dinners, and banquets, after the example of the Lord. But such entertainments the Lord has not called agapae. He says accordingly somewhere, \"When thou art called to a wedding, recline not on the highest couch; but when thou art called, fall into the lowest place; \"[fn-37-P3718_1126057:6-nf] and elsewhere, \"When thou makest a dinner or a supper; \"and again, \"But when thou makest an entertainment, call the poor,\"[fn-37-P3719_1126200:7-nf] for whose sake chiefly a supper ought to be made. And further, \"A certain man made a great supper, and called many.\"[fn-37-P3720_1126338:8-nf] But I perceive whence the specious appellation of suppers flowed: \"from the gullets and furious love for suppers\"-according to the comic poet. For, in truth, \"to many, many things are on account of the supper.\" For they have not yet learned that God has provided for His creature (man I mean) food and drink, for sustenance, not for pleasure; since the body derives no advantage from extravagance in viands. For, quite the contrary, those who use the most frugal fare are the strongest and the healthiest, and the noblest; as domestics are healthier and stronger than their masters, and husbandmen than the proprietors; and not only more robust, but wiser, as philosophers are wiser than rich men. For they have not buried the mind beneath food, nor deceived it with pleasures. But love (agape) is in truth celestial food, the banquet of reason. \"It beareth all things, endureth all things, hopeth all things. Love never faileth.\"[fn-37-P3721_1127286:9-nf] \"Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.\"[fn-37-P3722_1127368:10-nf] But the hardest of all cases is for charity, which faileth not, to be cast from heaven above to the ground into the midst of sauces. And do you imagine that I am thinking of a supper that is to be done away with? \"For if,\" it is said, \"I bestow all my goods, and have not love, I am nothing.\"[fn-37-P3723_1127680:11-nf] On this love alone depend the law and the Word; and if \"thou shalt love the Lord thy God and thy neighbour,\" this is the celestial festival in the heavens. But the earthly is called a supper, as has been shown from Scripture. For the supper is made for love, but the supper is not love (agape); only a proof of mutual and reciprocal kindly feeling. \"Let not, then, your good be evil spoken of; for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink,\" says the apostle, in order that the meal spoken of may not be conceived as ephemeral, \"but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-37-P3724_1128287:12-nf] He who eats of this meal, the best of all, shall possess the kingdom of God, fixing his regards here on the holy assembly of love, the heavenly Church. Love, then, is something pure and worthy of God, and its work is communication. \"And the care of discipline is love,\" as Wisdom says; \"and love is the keeping of the law.\"[fn-37-P3725_1128634:13-nf] And these joys have an inspiration of love from the public nutriment, which accustoms to everlasting dainties. Love (agape), then, is not a supper. But let the entertainment depend on love. For it is said, \"Let the children whom Thou hast loved, O Lord, learn that it is not the products of fruits that nourish man; but it is Thy word which preserves those who believe on Thee.\"[fn-37-P3726_1129036:14-nf] \"For the righteous shall not live by bread.\"[fn-37-P3727_1129101:15-nf] But let our diet be light and digestible, and suitable for keeping awake, unmixed with diverse varieties. Nor is this a point which is beyond the sphere of discipline. For love is a good nurse for communication; having as its rich provision sufficiency, which, presiding over diet measured in due quantity, and treating the body in a healthful way, distributes something from its resources to those near us, But the diet which exceeds sufficiency injures a man, deteriorates his spirit, and renders his body prone to disease. Besides, those dainty tastes, which trouble themselves about rich dishes drive to practices of ill-repute, daintiness, gluttony, greed, voracity, insatiability. Appropriate designations of such people as so indulge are flies, weasels, flatterers, gladiators, and the monstrous tribes of parasites-the one class surrendering reason, the other friendship, and the other life, for the gratification of the belly; crawling on their bellies, beasts in human shape after the image of their father, the voracious beast. People first called the abandoneda0sw/touj, and so appear to me to indicate their end, understanding them as those who are (a0sw/souj) unsaved, excluding the j. For those that are absorbed in pots, and exquisitely prepared niceties of condiments, are they not plainly abject, earth-born, leading an ephemeral kind of life, as if they were not to live [hereafter]? Those the Holy Spirit, by Isaiah, denounces as wretched, depriving them tacitly of the name of love (agape), since their feasting was not in accordance with the word. \"But they made mirth, killing calves, and sacrificing sheep, saying, Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.\" And that He reckons such luxury to be sin, is shown by what He adds, \"And your sin shall not be forgiven you till you die,\"[fn-37-P3728_1130943:16-nf] -not conveying the idea that death, which deprives of sensation, is the forgiveness of sin, but meaning that death of salvation which is the recompense of sin. \"Take no pleasure in abominable delicacies, says Wisdom.[fn-37-P3729_1131184:17-nf] At this point, too, we have to advert to what are called things sacrificed to idols, in order to show how we are enjoined to abstain from them.

Wherefore also Cleanthes, in the second book, On Pleasure, says that Socrates everywhere teaches that the just man and the happy are one and the same, and execrated the first man who separated the just from the useful, as having done an impious thing. For those are in truth impious who separate the useful from that which is tight according to the law. Plato himself says that happiness (eu0daimoni/a) is to possess rightly the daemon, and that the ruling faculty of the soul is called the daemon; and he terms happiness (eu0daimoni/a) the most perfect and complete good. Sometimes he calls it a consistent and harmonious life, sometimes the highest perfection in accordance with virtue; and this he places in the knowledge of the Good, and in likeness to God, demonstrating likeness to be justice and holiness with wisdom. For is it not thus that some of our writers have understood that man straightway on his creation received what is\"according to the image,\" but that what is according\"to the likeness\" he will receive afterwards on his perfection? Now Plato, teaching that the virtuous man shall have this likeness accompanied with humility, explains the following: \"He that humbleth himself shall be exalted.\"[fn-60-P6077_1854965:259-nf] He says, accordingly, in The Laws: \"God indeed, as the ancient saying has it, occupying the beginning, the middle, and the end of all things, goes straight through while He goes round the circumference. And He is always attended by Justice, the avenger of those who revolt from the divine law.\" You see how he connects fear with the divine law. He adds, therefore: \"To which he, who would be happy, cleaving, will follow lowly and beautified.\" Then, connecting what follows these words, and admonishing by fear, he adds: \"What conduct, then, is dear and conformable to God? That which is characterized by one word of old date: Like will be dear to like, as to what is in proportion; but things out of proportion are neither dear to one another, nor to those which are in proportion. And that therefore he that would be dear to God, must, to the best of his power, become such as He is. And in virtue of the same reason, our self-controlling man is dear to God. But he that has no self-control is unlike and diverse.\" In saying that it was an ancient dogma, he indicates the teaching which had come to him from the law. And having in the Theataetus admitted that evils make the circuit of mortal nature and of this spot, he adds: \"Wherefore we must try to flee hence as soon as possible. For flight is likeness to God as far as possible. And likeness is to become holy and just with wisdom.\" Speusippus, the nephew of Plato, says that happiness is a perfect state in those who conduct themselves in accordance with nature, or the state of the good: for which condition all men have a desire, but the good only attained to quietude; consequently the virtues are the authors of happiness. And Xenocrates the Chalcedonian defines happiness to be the possession of virtue, strictly so called, and of the power subservient to it. Then he clearly says, that the seat in which it resides is the soul; that by which it is effected, the virtues; and that of these as parts are formed praiseworthy actions, good habits and dispositions, and motions, and relations; and that corporeal and external objects are not without these. For Polemo, the disciple of Xenocrates, seems of the opinion that happiness is sufficiency of all good things, or of the most and greatest. He lays down the doctrine, then, that happiness never exists without virtue; and that virtue, apart from corporeal and external objects, is sufficient for happiness. Let these things be so. The contradictions to the opinions specified shall be adduced in due time. But on us it is incumbent to reach the unaccomplished end, obeying the commands-that is, God-and living according to them, irreproachably and intelligently, through knowledge of the divine will; and assimilation as far as possible in accordance with right reason is the end, and restoration to perfect adoption by the Son, which ever glorifies the Father by the great High Priest who has deigned to call us brethren and fellow-heirs. And the apostle, succinctly describing the end, writes in the Epistle to the Romans: \"But now, being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.\"[fn-60-P6078_1858156:260-nf] And viewing the hope as twofold-that which is expected, and that which has been received-he now teaches the end to be the restitution of the hope.\"For patience,\" he says, \"worketh experience, and experience hope: and hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit that is given to us.\"[fn-60-P6079_1858512:261-nf] On account of which love and the restoration to hope, he says, in another place, \"which rest is laid up for us.\"[fn-60-P6080_1858646:262-nf] You will find in Ezekiel the like, as follows: \"The soul that sinneth, it shall die. And the man who shall be righteous, and shall do judgment and justice, who has not eaten on the mountains, nor lifted his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, and hath not defiled his neighbour's wife, and hath not approached to a woman in the time of her uncleanness (for he does not wish the seed of man to be dishonoured), and will not injure a man; will restore the debtor's pledge, and will not take usury; will turn away his hand from wrong; will do true judgment between a man and his neighbour; will walk in my ordinances, and keep my commandments, so as to do the truth; he is righteous, he shall surely live, saith Adonai the Lord.\"[fn-60-P6081_1859410:263-nf] Isaiah too, in exhorting him that hath not believed to gravity of life, and the Gnostic to attention, proving that man's virtue and God's are not the same, speaks thus: \"Seek the Lord, and on finding Him call on Him. And when He shall draw near to you, let the wicked forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his ways; and let him return to the Lord, and he shall obtain mercy,\" down to \"and your thoughts from my thoughts.\"[fn-60-P6082_1859862:264-nf] \"We,\" then, according to the noble apostle, \"wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. For in Christ neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith which worketh by love.\"[fn-60-P6083_1860086:265-nf] And we desire that every one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope,\" down to \"made an high priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek.\"[fn-60-P6084_1860276:266-nf] Similarly with Paul \"the All-virtuous Wisdom\" says, \"He, that heareth me shall dwell trusting in hope.\"[fn-60-P6085_1860403:267-nf] For the restoration of hope is called by the same term \"hope.\" To the expression \"will dwell\" it has most beautifully added\" trusting,\" showing that such an one has obtained rest, having received the hope for which he hoped. Wherefore also it is added, \"and shall be quiet, without fear of any evil.\" And openly and expressly the apostle, in the first Epistle to the Corinthians says, \"Be ye followers of me, as also I am of Christ,\"[fn-60-P6086_1860857:268-nf] in order that that may take place. If ye are of me, and I am of Christ, then ye are imitators of Christ, and Christ of God. Assimilation to God, then, so that as far as possible a man becomes righteous and holy with wisdomhe lays down as the aim of faith, and the end to be that restitution of the promise which is effected by faith. From these doctrines gush the fountains, which we specified above, of those who have dogmatized about \"the end.\" But of these enough.","title":"Book II.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":14,"verse":26,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_61_book_iii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"107","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Et rursus cure dicit: \"Bonum est homini uxorem non tangere, sed propter fornicationes unusquisque suam uxorem habeat; \"[fn-64-P6438_1973547:176-nf] id veluti exponens, rursus dicit: \"Ne vos tentet Satanas.\"[fn-64-P6439_1973631:177-nf] Non enim iis, qui continenter utuntur matrimonio propter solam liberorum procreationem, dicit, \"propter intemperantiam; \"sed iis, qui finem liberorum procreationis cupiunt transilire: ne, cure nimium annuerit noster adversarius, excitet appetitionem ad alienas voluptates.

The Psalmody with which you will be received is a prelude to the Psalmody of Heaven; the lamps which you will kindle are a Sacrament of the illumination there with which we shall meet the Bridegroom, shining and virgin souls, with the lamps of our faith shining, not sleeping through our carelessness, that we may not miss Him that we look for if He come unexpectedly; nor yet unfed, and without oil, and destitute of good works, that we be not cast out of the Bridechamber.

He will come when the cry demands the meeting, and they who are prudent shall meet Him, with their light shining and its food abundant, but the others seeking for oil too late from those who possess it.

For none are there of the disdain fill, nor of the slothful, nor of those who are clothed in filthy rags and not in the Wedding garment even though here they may have thought themselves worthy of wearing the bright robe there, and secretly intruded themselves, deceiving themselves with vain hopes. And then, What? When we have entered, then the Bridegroom knows what He will teach us, and how He will converse with the souls that have come in with Him. He will converse with them, I think in teaching things more perfect and more pure.

For as we said a little while ago spirit does not beget spirit just as soul cannot procreate soul, though we do not doubt that the compacting of flesh is formed from man's seed, as the Apostle clearly distinguishes in the case of both substances; viz., flesh and spirit, what should be ascribed to whom as its author, and says: \"Moreover we have had fathers of our flesh for instructors, and we reverenced them: shall we not much more be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live? \"[fn-47-P4772_1733535:58-nf] What could show more clearly than this distinction, that he laid down that men were the fathers of our flesh, but always taught that God alone was the Father of souls. Although even in the actual compacting of this body a ministerial office alone must be attributed to men, but the chief part of its formation to God the Creator of all, as David says: \"Thy hands have made me and fashioned me:\"[fn-47-P4773_1733949:59-nf] And the blessed Job: \"Hast thou not milked me as milk, and curdled me as cheese? Thou hast put me together with bones and sinews;\"[fn-47-P4774_1734098:60-nf] and the Lord to Jeremiah: \"Before I formed thee in the womb, I knew thee.\"[fn-47-P4775_1734196:61-nf] But Ecclesiastes very clearly and accurately gathers the nature of either substance, and its beginning, by an examination of the rise and commencement, from which each originated, and by a consideration of the end to which each is tending, and decides also of the division of this body and soul, and discourses as follows: \"Before the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns unto God who gave it.\"[fn-47-P4776_1734632:62-nf] But what could be said with greater plainness than that he declares that the matter of the flesh which he styled dust, because it springs from the seed of man, and seems to be sown by his ministration, mush as it was taken from the earth, again return to the earth, while he points out that the spirit which is not begotten by intercourse between the sexes, but belongs to God alone in a special way, returns to its creator? And this also is clearly implied in that breathing by God, through which Adam in the first instance received his life. And so from these passages we clearly infer that no one can be called the Father of spirits but God alone, who makes them out of nothing whenever He pleases, while men can only be termed the fathers of our flesh. So then the devil also in as much as he was created a spirit or an angel and good, had no one as his Father but God his Maker. But when he had become puffed up by pride and had said in his heart: \"I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most High,\"[fn-47-P4777_1735685:63-nf] he became a liar, and \"abode not in the truth;\"[fn-47-P4778_1735773:64-nf] but brought forth a lie from his own storehouse of wickedness and so became not only a liar, but also the father of the actual lie, by which when he promised Divinity to man and said \"Ye shall be as gods,\"[fn-47-P4779_1736259:65-nf] he abode not in the truth, but from the beginning became a murderer, both by bringing Adam into a state of mortality, and by slaying Abel by the hand of his brother at his suggestion. But already the approach of dawn is bringing to a close our discussion, which has occupied nearly two whole nights, and our brief and simple words have drawn our bark of this Conference from the deep sea of questions to a safe harbour of silence, in which deep indeed, as the breath of the Divine Spirit drives us further in, so is there ever opened out a wider and boundless space reaching beyond the sight of our eye, and, as Solomon says, \"It will become much further from us than it was, and a great depth; who shall find it out?\"[fn-47-P4780_1737004:66-nf] Wherefore let us pray the Lord that both His fear and His love, which cannot fail, may continue steadfast in us, and make us wise in all things, and ever shield us unharmed, from the darts of the devil. For with these guards it is impossible for anyone to fall into the snares of death. But there is this difference between the perfect and imperfect, that in the case of the former love is steadfast, and so to speak riper and lasts more abidingly and so makes them persevere in holiness more steadfastly and more easily, while in the case of the latter its position is weaker and it more easily grows cold, and so quickly and more frequently allows them to be entangled in the snares of sin. And when we heard this, the words of this Conference so fired us that when we went away from the old man's cell we longed with a keener ardour of soul than when we first came, for the fulfilment of his teaching.","title":"VIII.

For in this sense also we may interpret without absurdity the declaration of the blessed Apostle Paul, when he says, \"Having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.\"[fn-59-P5970_2887542:54-nf] Whence also the Lord Himself bids the guests in the first instance to be invited to His great supper, and afterwards compelled; for on His servants making answer to Him, \"Lord, it is done as Thou hast commanded, and yet there is room,\" He said to them, \"Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in.\"[fn-59-P5971_2887880:55-nf] In those, therefore, who were first brought in with gentleness, the former obedience is fulfilled; but in those who were compelled, the disobedience is avenged. For what else is the meaning of \"Compel them to come in,\" after it had previously said, \"Bring in,\" and the answer had been made, \"Lord, it is done as Thou commanded, and yet there is room \"? If He had wished it to be understood that they were to be compelled by the terrifying force of miracles, many divine miracles were rather wrought in the sight of those who were first called, especially in the sight of the Jews, of whom it was said, \"The Jews require a sign; \"[fn-59-P5972_2888533:56-nf] and, moreover, among the Gentiles themselves the gospel was so commended by miracles in the time of the apostles, that had these been the means by which they were ordered to be compelled, we might rather have had good grounds for supposing, as I said before, that it was the earlier guests who were compelled. Wherefore, if the power which the Church has received by divine appointment in its due season, through the religious character and the faith of kings, be the instrument by which those who are found in the highways and hedges-that is, in heresies and schisms-are compelled to come in, then let them not find fault with being compelled, but consider whether they be so compelled. The supper of the Lord is the unity of the body of Christ, not only in the sacrament of the altar, but also in the bond of peace. Of the Donatists themselves, indeed, we can say that they compel no man to any good thing; for whomsoever they compel, they compel to nothing rise but evil.","title":"A Treatise Concerning the Correction of the Donatists","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":14,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_49_sermon_xxxii_lxxxii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"6.

Further that the grandeur of perfection was open to every age and either sex, and that all the members of the Church were urged to scale the heights of heavenly goodness when the Apostle said: \"So run that ye may obtain;\"[fn-63-P6349_2265571:23-nf] nor should those who were ready and eager for it hang back because of the delays of the slow and dawdlers, as it is better for the sluggards to be urged on by those running before than for those who are doing their best to be hampered by the slothful. Further that he had determined and made up his mind to renounce the world and to die to the world that he might live to God, and that if he could not attain this happiness; viz., to pass with his wife into union with Christ, he would rather be saved even with the loss of one member, and enter into the kingdom of heaven as one maimed rather than be condemned with his body whole. But he also added and spoke as follows: If Moses suffered wives to be divorced for the hardness of their hearts, why should not Christ allow this for the desire of chastity, especially when the same Lord among those other affections; viz., for fathers and mothers and children (all due regard to which not only the law but He Himself also charged to be shown, yet for His name's sake and for the desire of perfection He decreed that they should not simply be disregarded but actually hated)-to these, I say, He joined also the mention of wives, saying: \"And everyone that hath left house, or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children for My name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold and shall inherit eternal life.\"[fn-63-P6350_2266958:24-nf] So far then is He from allowing anything to be set against that perfection which He is proclaiming, that He actually enjoins that the ties to father and mother should be broken and disregarded out of love for Him, though according to the Apostle it is the first commandment with promise; viz., \"Honour thy father and thy mother, which is the first commandment with promise, that it may be well with thee and that thy days may be long upon earth.\"[fn-63-P6351_2267428:25-nf] And as the word of the gospel condemns those who break the chains of matrimony where there has been no sin of adultery, so it clearly promises a reward of an hundredfold to those who have cast off a carnal yoke out of love for Christ and the desire for chastity. Wherefore if it can be brought about that you may listen to reason and be turned together with me to this most desirable choice; viz., that we should together serve the Lord and escape the pains of hell, I will not refuse the affection of marriage, nay I will embrace it with a still greater love. For I acknowledge and honour my helpmeet assigned to me by the word of the Lord, and I do not refuse to be joined to her in an unbroken tie of love in Christ, nor do I separate from me what the Lord joined to me by the law of the original condition,[fn-63-P6352_2268260:26-nf] if only you yourself will be what your Maker meant you to be. But if you will not be a helpmeet, but prefer to make yourself a deceiver and an assistance not to me but to the adversary, and fancy that the sacrament of matrimony was granted to you for this reason that you may deprive yourself of this salvation which is offered to you, and also hold me back from following the Saviour as a disciple, then I will resolutely lay hold on the words which were uttered by the lips of Abbot John, or rather of Christ Himself, so that no carnal affection may be able to tear me away from spiritual blessings, for He says: \"He that hateth not father and mother and children and brothers and sisters and wife and lands, yea and his own soul also, cannot be My disciple.\"[fn-63-P6353_2269044:27-nf] When then by these and such like words the woman's purpose was not moved and she persisted in the same obstinate hardness, If, said the blessed Theonas, I cannot drag you away from death, neither shall you separate me from Christ: but it is safer for me to be divorced from a human person than from God. And so by the aid of God's grace he at once set about the execution of his purpose and suffered not the ardour of his desire to grow cool through any delay. For at once he stripped himself of all his worldly goods, and fled to a monastery, where in a very short time he was so famous for the splendour of his sanctity and humility that when John of blessed memory departed this life to the Lord, and the holy Elias, a man who was no less great than his predecessor, had likewise died, Theonas was chosen by the judgment of all as the third to succeed them in the administration of the almsgiving.","title":"XXI.

But if we are to love our enemies, it is in accordance with right reason that, ascending from them, we should love also those nearest in kindred. Or if we are to hate our blood-relations, deduction teaches us that much more are we to spurn from us our enemies. So that the reasonings would be shown to destroy one another. But they do not destroy each other, nor are they near doing so. For from the same feeling and disposition, and on the ground of the same rule, one loving his enemy may hate his father, in as much as he neither takes vengeance on an enemy, nor reverences a father more than Christ. For by the one word he extirpates hatred and injury, and by the other shamefacedness towards one's relations, if it is detrimental to salvation. If then one's father, or son, or brother, be godless, and become a hindrance to faith and an impediment to the higher life, let him not be friends or agree with him, but on account of the spiritual enmity, let him dissolve the fleshly relationship.","title":"Who is the Rich Man that Shall Be Saved?","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":14,"verse":26,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_76_xxiv_conference_of_abbot_abraham_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"35","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"The feebleness of your ideas shows that you have not yet renounced worldly desires nor mortified your former lusts. For as the wandering character of your desires testifies to the sloth of your heart, this pilgrimage and absence from your kinsfolk, which you ought rather to endure with your heart, you do endure only with the flesh. For all these things would have been buried and altogether driven out of your hearts, if you had got hold of the right method of renunciation, and the main reason for the solitude in which we dwell. And so I see that you are labouring under that infirmity of sluggishness, which is thus described in Proverbs: \"Every sluggard is always desiring something;\" and again: \"Desires kill the slothful.\"[fn-66-P6683_2391184:5-nf] For in our case too these supplies of worldly conveniences, which you have described, would not be wanting, if we believed that they were appropriate to our calling, or thought that we could get out of those delights and pleasures as much profit as that which is gained from this squalor of the country and bodily affliction. Nor are we so deprived of the solace of our kinsfolk, that those who delight to support us with their substance should fail us, were it not that this saying of the Saviour meets us and excludes everything that contributes to the support of this flesh, as He says: \"He who doth not leave (or hate) father and mother and children and brethren cannot be My disciple.\"[fn-66-P6684_2391975:6-nf] But if we were altogether deprived of the protection of our parents, the services of the princes of this world would not be wanting, as they would most thankfully rejoice to minister to our necessities with prompt liberality. And supported by their bounty, we should be free from the care of preparing food, were it not that this curse of the prophet terribly frightened us. For \"Cursed,\" he says, \"is the man that putteth his hope in man;\" and: \"Put not your trust in princes.\"[fn-66-P6685_2392481:7-nf] We should also at any rate place our cells on the banks of the river Nile and have water at our very doors, so as not to be obliged to carry it on our necks for four miles, were it not that the blessed Apostle rendered us indefatigable in enduring this labour, and cheered us by his words, saying: \"Every one shall receive his own reward according to his labour.\"[fn-66-P6686_2392865:8-nf] Nor are we ignorant that there are even in our country some pleasant recesses, where plenty of fruits, and pleasant gardens, and fertile ground would furnish the food we need with the slightest bodily efforts on our part, were it not that we were afraid lest that reproach might apply to us, which is directed against the rich man in the gospel: \"Because thou hast received thy consolation in this life.\"[fn-66-P6687_2393309:9-nf] But as we despise all these things and scorn them together with all the pleasures of this world, we delight only in this squalor, and prefer to all luxuries this dreadful and vast desert, and cannot compare any riches of a fertile soil to these barren sands, as we pursue no temporal gains of this body, but the eternal rewards of the spirit. For it is but little for a monk to have once made his renunciation, i.e., in the early days of his conversion to have disregarded the present world, unless he continues to renounce it daily. For to the very end of this life we must with the prophet say this: \"And I have not desired the day of man, Thou knowest.\"[fn-66-P6688_2393985:10-nf] Wherefore also the Lord says in the gospel: \"If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow Me.\"[fn-66-P6689_2394149:11-nf] ","title":"XXIV.

In the Psalm we have said, \"O God of hosts, turn us, and show us Thy Face, and we shall be saved.\"[fn-55-P5588_2363427:2-nf] In the Gospel we have been called to a supper; yea, rather others have been called, we not called, but led; not only led, but even forced. For so have we heard, that \"a certain Man made a great supper.\"[fn-55-P5589_2363646:3-nf] Who is this Man, but \"the Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus\"?[fn-55-P5590_2363742:4-nf] He sent that those who had been invited might come, for the hour was now come, that they should come. Who are they who had been invited, but those who had been called by the Prophets who were sent before? When? Of old, ever since the Prophets were sent, they invited to Christ's supper. They were sent then to the people of Israel. Often were they sent, often did they call men, to come at the hour of supper. But they received those who invited them, refused the supper. What means \"they received those who invited them, refused the supper\"? They read the Prophets and killed Christ. But when they killed Him, then though they knew it not, they prepared a Supper for us. When the Supper was now prepared, when Christ had been offered up, when the Supper of the Lord, which the faithful know, had been set forth after the resurrection of Christ, and established by His Hands and Mouth, were the Apostles sent to them, to whom the Prophets had been sent before. \"Come ye to the supper.\"","title":"Sermon LXII.

They who would not come made excuses. And how did they excuse themselves? There were three excuses: \"One said, I have bought a farm,[fn-55-P5592_2364880:5-nf] and I go to see it; have me excused. Another said, I have bought five pairs of oxen, and I go to prove them; I pray thee have me excused. A third said, I have married a wife, have me excused; I cannot come.\"[fn-55-P5593_2365108:6-nf] Do we suppose that these are not the excuses, which hinder all men, who decline to come to this supper? Let us look into them, discuss, find them out; but only that we may beware. In the purchase of the farm, the spirit of domination is marked out; therefore pride is rebuked. For men are delighted to have a farm, to hold, to possess it, to have men in it under them, to have dominion. An evil vice, the first vice. For the first man wished to have dominion, in that he would not that any should have dominion over him. What is to have dominion, but to take pleasure in one's own power? There is a greater power, let us submit ourselves to it, that we may be able to be safe. \"I have bought a farm, have me excused.\" Having discovered pride, he would not come.","title":"Sermon LXII.

But whence arose an occasion, so to say, to the Lord, to speak of this supper? One of them that sat at meat with Him (for He was at a feast, whither He had been invited), had said, \"Blessed are they who eat bread in the kingdom of God.\"[fn-56-P5602_2370702:12-nf] He sighed as though after distant things, and the Bread Himself was sitting down before him. Who is the Bread of the kingdom of God, but He who saith, \"I am the Living Bread which came down from heaven \"?[fn-56-P5603_2370926:13-nf] Do not get thy mouth ready, but thine heart. On this occasion it was that the parable of this supper was set forth. Lo, we believe in Christ,we receive Him with faith. In receiving Him weknow what to think of. We receive but little,and we are nourished in heart. It is not then what is seen, but what is believed, that feeds us.Therefore we too have not sought for that outward sense; nor have we said, \"Let them believe who have seen with their eyes, and handled with their hands the Lord Himself after His resurrection, if what is said be true; we do not touch Him, why should we believe?\" If we were to entertain such thoughts, we should be kept back from the supper by those \"five pairs of oxen.\" That ye may know, Brethren, that not the gratification of these five senses, which softens and ministers pleasure, but a kind of curiosity was denoted, He did not say, \"`I have bought five pairs of oxen,' and I go to feed them;\" but, \"I go to prove them.\" He who wishes to \"prove \"by \"the pairs of oxen,\" does not wish to be in doubt, just as St. Thomas by these \"pairs\" did not wish to be in doubt. \"Let me see, let me touch, let me put in my fingers.\" \"`Behold,' saith the Lord, `put in thy fingers along My Side, and be not unbelieving.'[fn-56-P5604_2372186:14-nf] For thy sake have I been slain; at the place which thou wishest to touch, have I shed My Blood, that I might redeem thee; and dost thou still doubt of Me, unless thou touch Me?

Let us come, and be filled. And who came but the beggars, the \"maimed,\" the \"halt,\" the \"blind\"? But there came not thither the rich, and the whole, who walked, as they thought, well, and saw acutely; who had great confidence in themselves, and were therefore in the more desperate case, in proportion as they were more proud. Let the beggars come, for He inviteth them, \"who, though He was rich, for our sakes became poor, that we beggars through His poverty might be enriched.\"[fn-56-P5615_2377435:22-nf] Let the maimed come, \"for they that are whole need not a physician, but they that are in evil case.\"[fn-56-P5616_2377557:23-nf] Let the halt come who may say to Him, \"Set in order my steps in Thy paths.\"[fn-56-P5617_2377661:24-nf] Let the blind come who may say, \"Enlighten mine eyes, that I may never sleep in death.\"[fn-56-P5618_2377766:25-nf] Such as these came at the hour, when those who had been first invited, had been rejected for their own excuses: they came at the hour, they entered in from the streets and lanes of the city.

I wish you to know, most pious father, that in these days there has arrived in our parts a certain person named Manes, who gives out that he is to complete the doctrine of the New Testament. And in the statements which he has made there have been some things, indeed, which may harmonize with our faith; but there have been also certain affirmations of his which seem very far removed from what has come down to us by the tradition of our fathers. For he has interpreted some doctrines in a strange fashion, imposing on them certain notions of his own, which have appeared to me to be altogether foreign and opposed to the faith. On the ground of these facts I have now been induced to write this letter to you, knowing the completeness and fulness of your intelligence in doctrine, and being assured that none of these things can escape your cognizance. Accordingly, I have also indulged the confident hope that you cannot be kept back by any grudge[fn-36-P3692_1033765:413-nf] from explaining these matters to us. As to myself, indeed, it is not possible that I shall be drawn away into any novel doctrine; nevertheless, in behalf of all the less instructed, I have been led to ask a word with your authority. For, in truth, the man shows himself to be a person of extraordinary force of character, both in speech and in action; and indeed his very aspect and attire also bear that out. But I shall here write down for your information some few points which I have been able to retain in my memory out of all the topics which have been expounded by him: for I know that even by these few you will have an idea of the rest. You well understand, no doubt, that those who seek to set up any new dogma have the habit of very readily perverting into a conformity with their own notions any proofs they desire to take from the Scriptures.[fn-36-P3693_1034637:414-nf] In anticipation, however, of this, the apostolic word marks out the case thus: \"If any one preach any other gospel unto you than that which you have received, let him be accursed.\"[fn-36-P3694_1034870:415-nf] And consequently, in addition to what has been once committed to us by the apostles, a disciple of Christ ought to receive nothing new as doctrine.[fn-36-P3695_1035037:416-nf] But not to make what I have got to say too long, I return to the subject directly in view. This man then maintained that the law of Moses, to speak shortly, does not proceed from the good God, but from the prince of evil; and that it has no kinship with the new law of Christ, but is contrary and hostile to it, the one being the direct antagonist of the other. When I heard such a sentiment propounded, I repeated to the people that sentence of the Gospel in which our Lord Jesus Christ said of Himself: \"I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil it.\"[fn-36-P3696_1035912:417-nf] The man, however, averred that He did not utter this saying at all; for he held that when we find that He did abrogate[fn-36-P3697_1036051:418-nf] that same law, we are bound to give heed, above all other considerations, to the thing which He actually did. Then he began to cite a great variety of passages from the law, and also many from the Gospel and from the Apostle Paul, which have the appearance of contradicting each other. All this he gave forth at the same time with perfect confidence, and without any hesitation or fear; so that I verily believe he has that serpent as his helper, who is ever our adversary. Well, he declared that there in the law God said, \"I make the rich man and the poor man; \"[fn-36-P3698_1036635:419-nf] while here in the Gospel Jesus called the poor blessed,[fn-36-P3699_1036713:420-nf] and added, that no man could be His disciple unless he gave up all that he had.[fn-37-P3700_1036812:421-nf] Again, he maintained that there Moses took silver and gold from the Egyptians when the people[fn-37-P3701_1036927:422-nf] fled out of Egypt;[fn-37-P3702_1037005:423-nf] whereas Jesus delivered the precept that we should lust after nothing belonging to our neighbour. Then he affirmed that Moses had provided in the law, that an eye should be given in penalty for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;[fn-37-P3703_1037252:424-nf] but that our Lord bade us offer the other cheek also to him who smote the one.[fn-37-P3704_1037351:425-nf] He told us, too, that there Moses commanded the man to be punished and stoned who did any work on the Sabbath, and who failed to continue in all things that were written in the law,[fn-37-P3705_1037553:426-nf] as in fact was done to that person who, yet being ignorant, had gathered a bundle of sticks on the Sabbath-day; whereas Jesus cured a cripple on the Sabbath, and ordered him then also to take up his bed.[fn-37-P3706_1037777:427-nf] And further, He did not restrain His disciples from plucking the ears of corn and rubbing them with their hands on the Sabbath-day,[fn-37-P3707_1037929:428-nf] which yet was a thing which it was unlawful to do on the Sabbaths. And why should I mention other instances? For with many different assertions of a similar nature these dogmas of his were propounded with the utmost energy and the most fervid zeal. Thus, too, on the authority of an apostle, he endeavoured to establish the position that the law of Moses is the law of death, and that the law of Jesus, on the contrary, is the law of life. For he based that assertion on the passage which runs thus: \"In which also may God make us[fn-37-P3708_1038479:429-nf] able ministers of the New Testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. But if the ministration of death, engraven in letters on the stones,[fn-37-P3709_1038695:430-nf] was made in glory, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away; how shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious? For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. For if that which shall be done away is glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.\"[fn-37-P3710_1039283:431-nf] And this passage, as you are also well aware, occurs in the second Epistle to the Corinthians. Besides, he added to this another passage out of the first epistle, on which he based his affirmation that the disciples of the Old Testament were earthly and natural; and in accordance with this, that flesh and blood could not possess the kingdom of God.[fn-37-P3711_1039659:432-nf] He also maintained that Paul himself spoke in his own proper person when he said: \"If I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.\"[fn-37-P3712_1039845:433-nf] Further, he averred that the same apostle made this statement most obviously on the subject of the resurrection of the flesh. when he also said that \"he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh,\"[fn-37-P3713_1040114:434-nf] and that according to the letter the law has in it no advantage.[fn-37-P3714_1040199:435-nf] And again he adduced the statement, that \"Abraham has glory, but not before God; \"[fn-37-P3715_1040301:436-nf] and that \"by the law there comes only the knowledge of sin.\"[fn-37-P3716_1040381:437-nf] And many other things did he introduce, with the view of detracting from the honour of the law, on the ground that the law itself is sin; by which statements the simpler people were somewhat influenced, as he continued to bring them forward; and in accordance with all this, he also made use of the affirmation, that \"the law and the prophets were until John.\"[fn-37-P3717_1040764:438-nf] He declared, however, that John preached the true kingdom of heaven; for verily he held, that by the cutting off of his head it was signified that all who went before him, and who had precedence over him, were to be cut off, and that what was to come after him was alone to be maintained. With reference to all these things, therefore, O most pious Archelaus, send us back a short reply in writing: for I have heard that you have studied such matters in no ordinary degree; and that capacity which you possess is God's gift, inasmuch as God bestows these gifts upon those who are worthy of them, and who are His friends, and who show themselves allied to Him in community of purpose and life. For it is our part to prepare ourselves, and to approach the gracious and liberal mind,[fn-37-P3718_1041566:439-nf] and forthwith we receive from it the most bountiful gifts. Accordingly, since the learning which I possess for the discussion of themes like these does not meet the requirements of my desire and purpose, for I confess myself to he an unlearned man, I have sent to you, as I have already said more than once, in the hope of obtaining from your hand the amplest solution to this question. May it be well with you, incomparable and honourable father!","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":14,"verse":33,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"53","folder":"ANF-06","text":"42. But I shall also offer, to the best of my ability, some expositions of the other words referred to; that is to say, I shall show that Jesus neither said nor did aught that was contrary to Moses. And first, as to the word, \"An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,\"[fn-37-P3743_1051433:461-nf] -that is the expression of justice. And as to His injunction, that a man, when struck on the one cheek, should offer the other also, that is the expression of goodness. Well, then, are justice and goodness opposed to each other? Far from it! There has only been an advance from simple justice to positive goodness. And again, we have the saying, \"The workman is worthy of his hire.\"[fn-37-P3744_1051836:462-nf] But if a person seeks to practise any fraud therein, it is surely most just[fn-37-P3745_1051932:463-nf] that what he has got possession of by fraud should be required of him, most especially when the hire is large. Now this I say, that when the Egyptians afflicted the children of Israel by the taskmasters who were set over them in the process of making bricks, Moses required and exacted the whole at once, with penalties, within one moment of time. But is this, then, to be called iniquity? Far from it! Surely it is the abstinence [fn-37-P3746_1052606:464-nf] of goodness, indeed, when one makes but a moderate use of what is really necessary, and gives up all that goes beyond that. Let us look, again, at the fact that in the Old Testament we find the words, \"I make the rich man and the poor man,\"[fn-37-P3747_1052946:465-nf] whereas Jesus calls the poor blessed.[fn-37-P3748_1053006:466-nf] Well, in that saying Jesus did; not refer to those who are poor simply in worldly substance, but to those who are poor in spirit, that is to say, who are not inflamed[fn-37-P3749_1053192:467-nf] with pride, but have the gentle and lowly dispositions of humility, not thinking of themselves more than they ought to think.[fn-37-P3750_1053388:468-nf] This question, however, is one which our adversary has not propounded correctly. For here I perceive that Jesus also looks on willingly at the gifts of the rich men, when they are put into the treasury.[fn-37-P3751_1053611:469-nf] All too little, at the same time, is it[fn-37-P3752_1053672:470-nf] if gifts are cast into[fn-37-P3753_1053895:471-nf] the treasury by the rich alone; and so there are the two mites of the poor widow which are also received with gladness; and in that offering verily something is exhibited that goes beyond what Moses prescribed on the subject of the receipt of moneys. For he received gifts from those who had; but Jesus receives them even from those who have not. But this man says, further, that it is written, that \"except a man shall forsake all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.\"[fn-37-P3754_1054456:472-nf] Wall, I observe again, that the centurion, a man exceedingly wealthy and well dowered with worldly influence, possessed a faith surpassing that of all Israel;[fn-37-P3755_1054636:473-nf] so that, even if there was any one who had forsaken all, that man was surpassed in faith by this centurion. But some one may now reason with us thus: It is not a good thing, consequently, to give up riches. Well, I reply that it is a good thing for those who are capable of it; but, at the, same time, to employ[fn-37-P3756_1054971:474-nf] riches for the work of righteousness and mercy, is a thing as acceptable as though one were to give up the whole at once. Again, as to the assertion that the Sabbath has been abolished, we deny that He has abolished it plainly;[fn-37-P3757_1055410:475-nf] for He was Himself also Lord of the Sabbath.[fn-37-P3758_1055469:476-nf] And this, the law's relation to the Sabbath, was like the servant who has charge of the bridegroom's chamber, and who prepares the same with all carefulness, and does not suffer it to be disturbed or touched by any stranger, but keeps it intact against the time of the bridegroom's arrival; so that when he is come, the same may be used as it pleases himself, or as it is granted to those to use it whom he has bidden enter along with him. And the Lord Jesus Christ Himself gave His testimony to what we affirm, when He said with His heavenly voice, \"Can ye make the children of the bride-chamber fast so long as the bridegroom is with them? \"[fn-37-P3759_1056134:477-nf] And again, He did not actually reject circumcision; but we should rather say that He received in Himself and in our stead the cause of circumcision,[fn-37-P3760_1056364:478-nf] relieving us by what He Himself endured, and not permitting us to have to suffer any pain to no purpose.[fn-37-P3761_1056521:479-nf] For what, indeed, can it profit a man to circumcise himself, if nevertheless he cherishes the worst of thoughts against his neighbour? He desired, accordingly, rather to open up to us the ways of the fullest life by a brief path,[fn-37-P3762_1056873:480-nf] lest perchance, after we had traversed lengthened courses of our own, we should find our day prematurely closing upon us in night, and lest, while outwardly indeed we might appear splendid to men's view, we should inwardly he comparable only to ravening wolves,[fn-37-P3763_1057292:481-nf] or be likened to whited sepulchres.[fn-37-P3764_1057350:482-nf] For far above any person of that type of character is to be placed the man who, although clad only in squalid and threadbare attire, keeps no evil hidden in his heart against his neighbour. For it is only the circumcision of the heart that brings salvation; and that merely carnal circumcision can be of no advantage to men, unless they happen also to he fortified with the spiritual circumcision. Listen also to what Scripture has to say on this subject: \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God? \"[fn-37-P3765_1057888:483-nf] What need, therefore, is there for me to labour and suffer, seeing that I have been made acquainted with the compendious way of life,[fn-37-P3766_1058041:484-nf] and know that it shall he mine if only I can be pure in heart? And that is quite in accordance with the truth which we have learned now, to wit, that if one prevails in the keeping of the two commandments, he fulfils the whole law and the prophets.[fn-37-P3767_1058313:485-nf] Moreover Paul, the chief of the apostles, after all these sayings, gives us yet clearer instruction on the subject, when be says, \"Or seek yea proof of that Christ who speaketh in me? \"[fn-37-P3768_1058522:486-nf] What have I then to do with circumcision, seeing that I may be justified in uncircumcision? For it is written: \"Is any man circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Or is any in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised. For neither of these is anything, but only the keeping of the commandments of God.\"[fn-37-P3769_1058856:487-nf] Consequently, as circumcision is incompetent to save any, it is not greatly to be required, especially when we see that if a man has been called in uncircumcision, and wishes then to be circumcised, he is made forthwith a transgressor[fn-37-P3770_1059118:488-nf] of the law. For if I am circumcised, I also fulfil the commandments of the law with the view of being in a position to be saved; but if I am uncircumcised, and remain in uncircumcision, much more in keeping the commandments shall I have life. For I have received the circumcision of the heart, in the spirit, and not that of the letter in the mere ink,[fn-37-P3771_1059591:489-nf] in which former there is praise, not of men, but of God.[fn-37-P3772_1059667:490-nf] Wherefore let no charge of this kind be brought against me. For just as the man of wealth, who possesses great treasures of gold and silver, so that he gets everything which is necessary for the uses of his house made of these precious metals, has no need to display any vessel of earthen-ware in anything belonging to his family and yet it does follow from this circumstance that the productions of the potter, or the art of making vessels of pottery,[fn-37-P3773_1060140:491-nf] are to be held in abhor-fence by him; so also I, who have been made rich by the grace of God, and who have obtained the circumcision of the heart, cannot by any means[fn-37-P3774_1060481:492-nf] stand in need of that most profitless fleshly circumcision, and yet, for all that, it does not follow that I should call it evil. Far be it from me to do so! If, however, any one desires to receive still more exact instruction on these matters, he will find them discussed with the greatest fulness in the apostle's first epistle.[fn-37-P3775_1060860:493-nf] ","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":14,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_24_letter_xix_to_dorus_bishop_of_beneventum_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"We grieve that the judgment, which we hoped to entertain of you, has been frustrated by our ascertaining that you have done things which by their blame-worthy novelty infringe the whole system of Church discipline: although you know full well with what care we wish the provisions of the canons to be kept through all the churches of the Lord, and the priests of all the peoples to consider it their especial duty to prevent the violation of the rules of the holy constitutions by any extravagances. We are surprised, therefore, that you who ought to have been a strict observer of the injunctions of the Apostolic See have acted so carelessly, or rather so contumaciously, as to show yourself not a guardian, but a breaker of the laws handed on to you. For from the report of your presbyter, Paul, which is subjoined, we have learnt that the order of the presbyterate has been thrown into confusion with you by strange intrigues and vile collusion; in such a way that one man has been hastily and prematurely promoted, and others passed over whose advancement was recommended by their age, and who were charged with no fault. But if the eagerness of an intriguer or the ignorant zeal of his supporters demanded that which custom never allowed, viz., that a beginner should be preferred to veterans, and a mere boy to men of years, it was your duty by diligence and teaching to check the improper desires of the petitioners with all reasonable authority: lest he whom you advanced hastily to the priestly rank should enter on his office to the detriment of those with whom he associated and become demoralized by the growth within him, not of the virtue of humility, but of the vice of conceit[fn-9-P931_213256:1-nf] . For you were not unaware that the Lord had said that \"he that humbleth himself shall be exalted: but he that exalteth himself shall be humbled[fn-9-P932_213702:2-nf] ,\" and also had said, \"but ye seek from little to increase, and from the greater to be less[fn-9-P933_213828:3-nf] .\" For both actions are out of order and out of place[fn-9-P934_214120:4-nf] : and all the fruit of men's labours is lost, all the measure of their deserts is rendered void, if the gaining of dignity is proportioned to the amount of flattery used: so that the eagerness to be eminent belittles not only the aspirer himself, but also him that connives at him. But if, as is asserted, the first and second presbyter were so agreeable to Epicarpius being put over their heads as to demand his being honoured to their own disgrace, that which they wished ought not to have been granted them when they were voluntarily degrading themselves: because it would have been worthier of you to oppose than to yield to such a pitiable wish. But their base and cowardly submission could not be to the prejudice of others whose consciences were good, and who had not done despite to God's grace; so that, whatever the transaction was whereby they gave up their precedence to another, they could not lower the dignity of those that came next to them, nor because they had placed the last above themselves, could he take precedence of the rest.","title":"Letter XIX.

IF, my true brother, you gladly suffer yourself to be advised by me as to what course of action you should pursue, specially in the points in which you have referred to me for advice, you will owe me your salvation. Many men have had the courage to enter upon the solitary life; but to live it out to the end is a task which perhaps has been achieved by few. The end is not necessarily involved in the intention; yet in the end is the guerdon of the toil. No advantage, therefore, accrues to men who fail to press on to the end of what they have in view and only adopt the solitary's life in its inception. Nay, they make their profession ridiculous, and are charged by outsiders with unmanliness and instability of purpose. Of these, moreover, the Lord says, who wishing to build a house \"sitteth not down first and counteth the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it? lest haply after he hath laid the foundation and is not able to finish it,\" the passers-by \"begin to mock him saying,\" this man laid a foundation \"and was not able to finish.\"[fn-31-P3174_1040656:2-nf] Let the start, then, mean that you heartily advance in virtue. The right noble athlete Paul, wishing us not to rest in easy security on so much of our life as may have been lived well in the past, but, every day to attain further progress, says \"Forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling.\"[fn-31-P3175_1041080:3-nf] So truly stands the whole of human life, not contented with what has gone before and fed not so much on the past as on the future. For how is a man the better for having his belly filled yesterday, if his natural hunger fails to find its proper satisfaction in food to-day? In the same way the soul gains nothing by yesterday's virtue unless it be followed by the right conduct of to-day.
