{"verses":["And it came to pass, when Jesus went into the house of one of the\nPharisees, on the sabbath day, that they watched him.","And behold, there was a certain man before him that had the\ndropsy.","And Jesus answering, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying:\nIs it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?","But they held their peace.  But he taking him, healed him and sent\nhim away.","And answering them, he said:  Which of you shall have an ass or an\nox fall into a pit and will not immediately draw him out, on the\nsabbath day?","And they could not answer him to these things.","And he spoke a parable also to them that were invited, marking\nhow they chose the first seats at the table, saying to them:","When thou art invited to a wedding, sit not down in the first\nplace, lest perhaps one more honourable than thou be invited by him:","And he that invited thee and him, come and say to thee:  Give this\nman place.  And then thou begin with shame to take the lowest place.","But when thou art invited, go, sit down in the lowest place;\nthat when he who invited thee cometh, he may say to thee:  Friend, go up\nhigher.  Then shalt thou have glory before them that sit at table with\nthee.","Because every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled:  and he\nthat humbleth himself shall be exalted.","And he said to him also that had invited him:  When thou makest a\ndinner or a supper, call not thy friends nor thy brethren nor thy\nkinsmen nor thy neighbours who are rich; lest perhaps they also invite\nthee again, and a recompense be made to thee.","But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the\nlame and the blind.","And thou shalt be blessed, because they have not wherewith to\nmake thee recompense:  for recompense shall be made thee at the\nresurrection of the just.","When one of them that sat at table with him had heard these\nthings, he said to him:  Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the\nkingdom of God.","But he said to him:  A certain man made a great supper and\ninvited many.","And he sent his servant at the hour of supper to say to them\nthat were invited, that they should come:  for now all things are ready.","And they began all at once to make excuse.  The first said to\nhim:  I have bought a farm and I must needs go out and see it.  I pray\nthee, hold me excused.","And another said:  I have bought five yoke of oxen and I go to\ntry them.  I pray thee, hold me excused.","And another said:  I have married a wife; and therefore I cannot\ncome.","And the servant returning, told these things to his lord.  Then\nthe master of the house, being angry, said to his servant:  Go out\nquickly into the streets and lanes of the city; and bring in hither the\npoor and the feeble and the blind and the lame.","And the servant said:  Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded;\nand yet there is room.","And the Lord said to the servant:  Go out into the highways and\nhedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.","But I say unto you that none of those men that were invited\nshall taste of my supper.","And there went great multitudes with him.  And turning, he said\nto them:","If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother and\nwife and children and brethren and sisters, yea and his own life also,\nhe cannot be my disciple.","And whosoever doth not carry his cross and come after me cannot\nbe my disciple.","For which of you, having a mind to build a tower, doth not first\nsit down and reckon the charges that are necessary, whether he have\nwherewithal to finish it:","Lest, after he hath laid the foundation and is not able to\nfinish it, all that see it begin to mock him,","Saying:  This man began to build and was not able to finish.","Or, what king, about to go to make war against another king,\ndoth not first sit down and think whether he be able, with ten\nthousand, to meet him that, with twenty thousand, cometh against him?","Or else, while the other is yet afar off, sending an embassy, he\ndesireth conditions of peace.","So likewise every one of you that doth not renounce all that he\npossesseth cannot be my disciple.","Salt is good.  But if the salt shall lose its savour, wherewith\nshall it be seasoned?","It is neither profitable for the land nor for the dunghill:  but\nshall be cast out.  He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."]}
