Or what stranger would he spare who had not even spared his own father? Whom, in truth, should he fear, who had conquered in war, and destroyed by massacre the race of the Titans, which was strong and excelling in might? What wonder if the whole multitude, pressed by unusual fear, had given themselves up to the adulation of a single man? Him they venerated, to him they paid the greatest honour. And since it is judged to be a kind of obsequiousness to imitate the customs and vices of a king, all men laid aside piety, lest, if they should live piously, they might seem to upbraid the wickedness of the king. Thus, being corrupted by continual imitation, they abandoned divine right, and the practice of living wickedly by degrees became a habit. And now nothing remained of the pious and excellent condition of the preceding age; but justice being banished, and drawing with her the truth, left to men error, ignorance, and blindness. The poets therefore were ignorant, who sung that she fled to heaven, to the kingdom of Jupiter. For if justice was on the earth in the age which they call \"golden,\" it is plain that she was driven away by Jupiter, who changed the golden age. But the change of the age and the expulsion of justice is to be deemed nothing else, as I have said, than the laying aside of divine religion, which alone effects that man should esteem man dear, and should know that he is bound to him by the tie of brotherhood, since God is alike a Father to all, so as to share the bounties of the common God and Father with those who do not possess them; to injure no one, to oppress no one, not to close his door against a stranger, nor his ear against a suppliant, but to be bountiful, beneficent, and liberal, which Tullius[fn-18-P1837_731185:61-nf] thought to be praises suitable to a king. This truly is justice, and this is, the golden age, which was first corrupted when Jupiter reigned, and shortly afterwards, when he himself and all his offspring were consecrated as gods, and the worship of many deities undertaken, had been altogether taken away.","title":"Book V.

Coming to the Gospel he sets before us Zacharias and Elizabeth, Peter and his mother-in-law, and, with a shamelessness to which we have now grown accustomed, fails to understand that they, too, ought to have been reckoned among those who served the Law. For the Gospel had no being before the crucifixion of Christ-it was consecrated by His passion and by His blood. In accordance with this rule Peter and the other Apostles (I must give Jovinianus something now and then out of my abundance) had indeed wives, but those which they had taken before they knew the Gospel. But once they were received into the Apostolate, they forsook the offices of marriage. For when Peter, representing the Apostles, says to the Lord:[fn-63-P6320_1936460:161-nf] \"Lo we have left all and followed thee,\" the Lord answered him,[fn-63-P6321_1936546:162-nf] \"Verily I say unto you, there is no man that hath left house or wife, or brethren, or parents, or children for the kingdom of God's sake, who shall not receive manifold more in this time, and in the world to come eternal life.\" But if, in order to show that all the Apostles had wives, he meets us with the words[fn-63-P6322_1936898:163-nf] \"Have we no right to lead about women or wives\" (for gunh in Greek has both meanings) \"even as the rest of the apostles, and Cephas, and the brethren of the Lord?\" let him add what is found in the Greek copies, \"Have we no right to lead about women that are sisters, or wives?\" This makes it clear that the writer referred to other holy women, who, in accordance with Jewish custom, ministered to their teachers of their substance, as we read was the practice with even our Lord himself. Where there is a previous reference to eating and drinking, and the outlay of money, and mention is afterwards made of women that are sisters, it is quite clear, as we have said, that we must understand, not wives, but those women who ministered of their substance. And we read the same account in the Old Testament of the Shunammite who was wont to welcome Elisha, and to put for him a table, and bread, and a candlestick, and the rest. At all events if we take gunaikaj to mean wives, not women, the addition of the word sisters destroys the effect of the word wives, and shews that they were related in spirit, not by wedlock. Nevertheless, with the exception of the Apostle Peter, it is not openly stated that the Apostles had wives; and since the statement is made of one while nothing is said about the rest, we must understand that those of whom Scripture gives no such description had no wives. Yet Jovinianus, who has arrayed against us Zacharias and Elizabeth, Peter and his wife's mother, should know, that John was the son of Zacharias and Elizabeth, that is, a virgin was the offspring of marriage, the Gospel of the law, chastity of matrimony; so that by a virgin prophet the virgin Lord might be both announced and baptized. But we might say concerning Peter, that he had a mother-in-law when he believed, and no longer had a wife, although in the[fn-63-P6323_1939524:164-nf] \"Sentences\" we read of both his wife and daughter. But for the present our argument must be based wholly on Scripture. He has made his appeal to the Apostles, because he thinks that they, who hold the chief authority in our moral system and are the typical Christian teachers, were not virgins. If, then, we allow that they were not virgins (and, with the exception of Peter, the point cannot be proved), yet I must tell him that it is to the Apostles that the words of Isaiah relate:[fn-63-P6324_1940049:165-nf] \"Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah.\" So, then, they who were by birth Jews could not under the Gospel recover the virginity which they had lost in Judaism. And yet John, one of the disciples, who is related to have been the youngest of the Apostles, and who was a virgin when he embraced Christianity, remained a virgin, and on that account was more beloved by our Lord, and lay upon the breast of Jesus. And what Peter, who had had a wife, did not dare ask,[fn-63-P6325_1940620:166-nf] he requested John to ask. And after the resurrection, when Mary Magdalene told them that the Lord had risen,[fn-63-P6326_1940754:167-nf] they both ran to the sepulchre, but John outran Peter. And when they were fishing in the ship on the lake of Gennesaret, Jesus stood upon the shore, and the Apostles knew not who it was they saw;[fn-63-P6327_1940972:168-nf] the virgin alone recognized a virgin, and said to Peter, \"It is the Lord.\" Again, after hearing the prediction that he must be bound by another, and led whither he would not, and must suffer on the cross. Peter said, \"Lord what shall this man do?\" being unwilling to desert John, with whom he had always been united. Our Lord said to him, \"What is that to thee if I wish him so to be?\" Whence the saying went abroad among the brethren that that disciple should not die. Here we have a proof that virginity does not die, and that the defilement of marriage is not washed away by the blood of martyrdom, but virginity abides with Christ, and its sleep is not death but a passing to another state. If, however, Jovinianus should obstinately contend that John was not a virgin, (whereas we have maintained that his virginity was the cause of the special love our Lord bore to him), let him explain, if he was not a virgin, why it was that he was loved more than the other Apostles. But you say,[fn-63-P6328_1941990:169-nf] the Church was rounded upon Peter: although[fn-63-P6329_1942059:170-nf] elsewhere the same is attributed to all the Apostles, and they all receive the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and the strength of the Church depends upon them all alike, yet one among the twelve is chosen so that when a head has been appointed, there may be no occasion for schism. But why was not John chosen, who was a virgin? Deference was paid to age, because Peter was the eider: one who was a youth, I may say almost a boy, could not be set over men of advanced age; and a good master who was bound to remove every occasion of strife among his disciples, and who had said to them,[fn-63-P6330_1942702:171-nf] \"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you,\" and,[fn-63-P6331_1942783:172-nf] \"He that is the greater among you, let him be the least of all,\" would not be thought to afford cause of envy against the youth whom he had loved. We maybe sure that John was then a boy because ecclesiastical history most clearly proves that he lived to the reign of Trajan, that is, he fell asleep in the sixty-eighth year after our Lord's passion, as I have briefly noted in my treatise on Illustrious Men.[fn-63-P6332_1943234:173-nf] Peter is an Apostle, and John is an Apostle-the one a married man, the other a virgin; but Peter is an Apostle only, John is both an Apostle and an Evangelist, and a prophet. An Apostle, because he wrote to the Churches as a master; an Evangelist, because he composed a Gospel, a thing which no other of the Apostles, excepting Matthew, did; a prophet, for he saw in the island of Patmos, to which he had been banished by the Emperor Domitian as a martyr for the Lord, an Apocalypse containing the boundless mysteries of the future Tertullian, more over, relates that he was sent to Rome, and that having been plunged into a jar of boiling oil he came out fresher and more active than when he went in. But his very Gospel is widely different from the rest. Matthew as though he were writing of a man begins thus: \"The book of the Generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham;\" Luke begins with the priesthood of Zacharias; Mark with a prophecy of the prophets Malachi and Isaiah. The first has the face of a man, on account of the genealogical table; the second, the face of a calf, on account of the priesthood; the third, the face of a lion, on account of the voice of one crying in the desert,[fn-63-P6333_1944501:174-nf] \"Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.\" But John like an eagle soars aloft, and reaches the Father Himself, and says,[fn-63-P6334_1944656:175-nf] \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God,\" and so on. The virgin writer expounded mysteries which the married could not, and to briefly sum up all and show how great was the privilege of John, or rather of virginity in John, the Virgin Mother[fn-63-P6335_1944999:176-nf] was entrusted by the Virgin Lord to the Virgin disciple.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":22,"verse":33,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_104_sermon_lxxxvii_cxxxvii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"3.

Just as it constantly happens in fact to invalids, that the sick man knows not what is going on within him, but the physician knows; when yet the former is suffering from the very sickness, and the physician is not. The physician can better tell what is going on in another, than he who is sick what is going on in himself. Peter then was at that time the invalid, and the Lord the Physician. The former declared that he had strength, when he had not; but the Lord touching the pulse of his heart, declared that he should deny Him thrice. And so it came to pass, as the Physician foretold, not as the sick presumed. Therefore, after His resurrection the Lord questioned him, not as being ignorant with what a heart he would confess the love of Christ, but that he might by a threefold confession of love, efface the threefold denial of fear.","title":"Sermon LXXXVII.

Reading one day at one of these meetings that passage in the Gospel where it is said,[fn-19-P1995_867579:12-nf] `Now it was the Feast of the Jews called the Passover,' he added what was never written nor heard of before: `Cursed be he that celebrates the Passover out of the days of unleavened bread.' When these words were reported among the people, the more simple of the Novatian laity, deceived by this artifice, flocked to him. But his fraudulent fabrication was of no avail to him; for his forgery issued in most disastrous consequences. For shortly afterwards he kept this feast in anticipation of the Christian Easter; and many according to their custom flocked to him. While they were passing the night in the accustomed vigils, a panic as if caused by evil spirits fell upon them, as if Sisinnius their bishop were coming with a multitude of persons to attack them. From the perturbation that might be expected in such a case, and their being shut up at night in a confined place, they trod upon one another, insomuch that above seventy of them were crushed to death. On this account many deserted Sabbatius: some however, holding his ignorant prejudice, remained with him.

To this definition we take no exception, except that we would not ascribe this twofold distinction to the nature (of the soul). It is the rational element which we must believe to be its natural condition, impressed upon it from its very first creation by its Author, who is Himself essentially rational. For how should that be other than rational, which God produced on His own prompting; nay more, which He expressly sent forth by His own afflatus or breath? The irrational element, however, we must understand to have accrued later, as having proceeded from the instigation of the serpent-the very achievement of (the first) transgression-which thenceforward became inherent in the soul, and grew with its growth, assuming the manner by this time of a natural development, happening as it did immediately at the beginning of nature. But, inasmuch as the same Plato speaks of the rational element only as existing in the soul of God Himself, if we were to ascribe the irrational element likewise to the nature which our soul has received from God, then the irrational element will be equally derived from God, as being a natural production, because God is the author of nature. Now from the devil proceeds the incentive to sin. All sin, however, is irrational: therefore the irrational proceeds from the devil, from whom sin proceeds; and it is extraneous to God, to whom also the irrationalis an alien principle. The diversity, then, between these two elements arises from the difference of their authors. When, therefore, Plato reserves the rational element (of the soul) to God alone, and subdivides it into two departments the irascible, which they call qumiko/n, and the concupiscible, which they designate by the term e0piqumhtiko/n (in such a way as to make the first common to us and lions, and the second shared between ourselves and flies, whilst the rational element is confined to us and God)-I see that this point will have to be treated by us, owing to the facts which we find operating also in Christ. For you may behold this triad of qualities in the Lord. There was the rational element, by which He taught, by which He discoursed, by which He prepared the way of salvation; there was moreover indignation in Him, by which He inveighed against the scribes and the Pharisees; and there was the principle of desire, by which He so earnestly desired to eat the pass over with His disciples.[fn-27-P2727_912997:111-nf] In our own cases, accordingly, the irascible and the concupiscible elements of our soul must not invariably be put to the account of the irrational (nature), since we are sure that in our Lord these elements operated in entire accordance with reason. God will be angry, with perfect reason, with all who deserve His wrath; and with reason, too, will God desire whatever objects and claims are worthy of Himself. For He will show indignation against the evil man, and for the good man will He desire salvation. To ourselves even does the apostle allow the concupiscible quality. \"If any man,\" says he, \"desireth the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.\"[fn-27-P2728_913680:112-nf] Now, by saying \"a good work,\" he shows us that the desire is a reasonable one. He permits us likewise to feel indignation. How should he not, when he himself experiences the same? \"I would,\" says he, \"that they were even cut off which trouble you.\"[fn-27-P2729_913951:113-nf] In perfect agreement with reason was that indignation which resulted from his desire to maintain discipline and order. When, however, he says, \"We were formerly the children of wrath,\"[fn-27-P2730_914155:114-nf] he censures an irrational irascibility, such as proceeds not from that nature which is the production of God, but from that which the devil brought in, who is himself styled the lord or \"master\" of his own class, \"Ye cannot serve two masters,\"[fn-27-P2731_914418:115-nf] and has the actual designation of \"father: \"\"Ye are of your father the devil.\"[fn-27-P2732_914518:116-nf] So that you need not be afraid to ascribe to him the mastery and dominion over that second, later, and deteriorated nature (of which we have been speaking), when you read of him as \"the sewer of tares, and the nocturnal spoiler of the crop of corn.[fn-27-P2733_914787:117-nf] ","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":22,"verse":19,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_22_a_treatise_on_the_soul_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"101","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Then, again, when we encounter the question (as to the veracity of those five senses which we learn with our alphabet; since from this source even there arises some support for our heretics.

Deception is imputed to the sight, because it asserts that oars, when immersed in the water, are inclined or bent, notwithstanding the certainty that they are straight; because, again, it is quite sure that distant tower with its really quadrangular contour is round; because also it will discredit the fact of the truly parallel fabric of yonder porch or arcade, by supposing it to be narrower and narrower towards its end; and because it will join with the sea the sky which hangs at so great a height above it. In the same way, our hearing is charged with fallacy: we think, for instance, that is a noise in the sky which is nothing else than the rumbling of a carriage; or, if you prefer it[fn-27-P2739_916255:120-nf] the other way, when the thunder rolled at a distance, we were quite sure that it was a carriage which made the noise. Thus, too, are our faculties of smell and taste at fault, because the selfsame perfumes and wines lose their value after we have used them awhile. On the same principle our touch is censured, when the identical pavement which seemed rough to the hands is felt by the feet to be smooth enough; and in the baths a stream of warm water is pronounced to be quite hot at first, and beautifully temperate afterwards. Thus, according to them, our senses deceive us, when all the while we are (the cause of the discrepancies, by) changing our opinions. The Stoics are more moderate in their views; for they do not load with the obloquy of deception every one of the senses, and at all times. The Epicureans, again, show still greater consistency, in maintaining that all the senses are equally true in their testimony, and always so-only in a different way. It is not our organs of sensation that are at fault, but our opinion. The senses only experience sensation, they do not exercise opinion; it is the soul that opines. They separated opinion from the senses, and sensation from the soul. Well, but whence comes opinion, if not from the senses? Indeed, unless the eye had descried a round shape in that tower, it could have had no idea that it possessed roundness. Again, whence arises sensation if not from the soul? For if the soul had no body, it would have no sensation. Accordingly, sensation comes from the soul, and opinion from sensation; and the whole (process) is the soul. But further, it may well be insisted on that there is a something which causes the discrepancy between the report of the senses and the reality of the facts. Now, since it is possible, (as we have seen), for phenomena to be reported which exist not in the objects, why should it not be equally possible for phenomena to be reported which are caused not by the senses, but by reasons and conditions which intervene, in the very nature of the case? If so, it will be only right that they should be duly recognised. The truth is, that it was the water which was the cause of the oar seeming to be inclined or bent: out of the water, it was perfectly straight in appearance (as well as in fact). The delicacy of the substance or medium which forms a mirror by means of its luminosity, according as it is struck or shaken, by the vibration actually destroys the appearance of the straightness of a right line. In like manner, the condition of the open space which fills up the interval between it and us, necessarily causes the true shape of the tower to escape our notice; for the uniform density of the surrounding air covering its angles with a similar light obliterates their outlines. So, again, the equal breadth of the arcade is sharpened or narrowed off towards its termination, until its aspect, becoming more and more contracted under its prolonged roof, comes to a vanishing point in the direction of its farthest distance. So the sky blends itself with the sea, the vision becoming spent at last, which had maintained duly the boundaries of the two elements, so long as its vigorous glance lasted. As for the (alleged cases of deceptive) hearing, what else could produce the illusion but the similarity of the sounds? And if the perfume afterwards was less strong to the smell, and the wine more flat to the taste, and the water not so hot to the touch, their original strength was after all found in the whole of them pretty well unimpaired. In the matter, however, of the roughness and smoothness of the pavement, it was only natural and right that limbs like the hands and the feet, so different in tenderness and callousness, should have different impressions. In this way, then, there cannot occur an illusion in our senses without an adequate cause. Now if special causes, (such as we have indicated, ) mislead our senses add (through our senses) our opinions also, then we must no longer ascribe the deception to the senses, which follow the specific causes of the illusion, nor to the opinions we form; for these are occasioned and controlled by our senses, which only follow the causes. Persons who are afflicted with madness or insanity, mistake one object for another. Orestes in his sister sees his mother; Ajax sees Ulysses in the slaughtered herd; Athamas and Agave descry wild beasts in their children. Now is it their eyes or their phrenzy which you must blame for so vast a fallacy? All things taste bitter, in the redundancy of their bile, to those who have the jaundice. Is it their taste which you will charge with the physical prevarication, or their ill state of health? All the senses, therefore, are disordered occasionally, or imposed upon, but only in such a way as to be quite free of any fault in their own natural functions. But further still, not even against the specific causes and conditions themselves must we lay an indictment of deception. For, since these physical aberrations happen for stated reasons, the reasons do not deserve to be regarded as deceptions. Whatever ought to occur in a certain manner is not a deception. If, then, even these circumstantial causes must be acquitted of all censure and blame, how much more should we free from reproach the senses, over which the said causes exercise a liberal sway! Hence we are bound most certainly to claim for the senses truth, and fidelity, and integrity, seeing that they never render any other account of their impressions than is enjoined on them by the specific causes or conditions which in all cases produce that discrepancy which appears between the report of the senses and the reality of the objects. What mean you, then, O most insolent Academy? You overthrow the entire condition of human life; you disturb the whole order of nature; you obscure the good providence of God Himself: for the senses of man which God has appointed over all His works, that we might understand, inhabit, dispense, and enjoy them, (you reproach) as fallacious and treacherous tyrants! But is it not from these that all creation receives our services? Is it not by their means that a second form is impressed even upon the world?-so many arts, so many industrious resources, so many pursuits, such business, such offices, such commerce, such remedies, counsels, consolations, modes, civilizations, and accomplishments of life! All these things have produced the very relish and savour of human existence; whilst by these senses of man, he alone of all animated nature has the distinction of being a rational animal, with a capacity for intelligence and knowledge-nay, an ability to form the Academy itself! But Plato, in order to disparage the testimony of the senses, in the Phµdrus denies (in the person of Socrates) his own ability to know even himself, according to the injunction of the Delphic oracle; and in the Theµtetus he deprives himself of the faculties of knowledge and sensation; and again, in the Phµdrus he postpones till after death the posthumous knowledge, as he calls it, of the truth; and yet for all he went on playing the philosopher even before he died. We may not, I say, we may not call into question the truth of the (poor vilified) senses,[fn-27-P2740_923523:121-nf] lest we should even in Christ Himself, bring doubt upon[fn-27-P2741_923600:122-nf] the truth of their sensation; lest perchance it should be said that He did not really \"behold Satan as lightning fall from heaven; \"[fn-27-P2742_923753:123-nf] that He did not really hear the Father's voice testifying of Himself;[fn-27-P2743_923842:124-nf] or that He was deceived in touching Peter's wife's mother;[fn-27-P2744_923923:125-nf] or that the fragrance of the ointment which He afterwards smelled was different from that which He accepted for His burial;[fn-27-P2745_924070:126-nf] and that the taste of the wine was different from that which He consecrated in memory of His blood.[fn-27-P2746_924195:127-nf] On this false principle it was that Marcion actually chose to believe that He was a phantom, denying to Him the reality of a perfect body.

We may not, I say, we may not call into question the truth of the (poor vilified) senses,[fn-27-P2740_923523:121-nf] lest we should even in Christ Himself, bring doubt upon[fn-27-P2741_923600:122-nf] the truth of their sensation; lest perchance it should be said that He did not really \"behold Satan as lightning fall from heaven; \"[fn-27-P2742_923753:123-nf] that He did not really hear the Father's voice testifying of Himself;[fn-27-P2743_923842:124-nf] or that He was deceived in touching Peter's wife's mother;[fn-27-P2744_923923:125-nf] or that the fragrance of the ointment which He afterwards smelled was different from that which He accepted for His burial;[fn-27-P2745_924070:126-nf] and that the taste of the wine was different from that which He consecrated in memory of His blood.[fn-27-P2746_924195:127-nf] On this false principle it was that Marcion actually chose to believe that He was a phantom, denying to Him the reality of a perfect body.

If, because injustice is not from God, but from the devil, and persecution consists of injustice (for what more unjust than that the bishops of the true God, that all the followers of the truth, should be dealt with after the manner o the vilest criminals?), persecution therefore seems to proceed from the devil, by whom the injustice which constitutes persecution is perpetrated, we ought to know, as you have neither persecution without the injustice of the devil, nor the trial of faith without persecution, that the injustice necessary for the trial of faith does not give a warrant for persecution, but supplies an agency; that in reality, in reference to the trial of faith, which is the reason of persecution, the will of God goes first, but that as the instrument of persecution, which is the way of trial, the injustice of the devil follows. For in other respects, too, injustice in proportion to the enmity it displays against righteousness affords occasion for attestations of that to which it is opposed as an enemy, that so righteousness may be perfected in injustice, as strength is perfected in weakness.[fn-19-P1936_571808:4-nf] For the weak things of the world have been chosen by God to confound the strong, and the foolish things of the world to confound its wisdom.[fn-19-P1937_571967:5-nf] Thus even injustice is employed, that righteousness may be approved in putting unrighteousness to shame. Therefore, since the service is not of free-will, but of subjection (for persecution is the appointment of the Lord for the trial of faith, but its ministry is the injustice of the devil, supplied that persecution may be got up), we believe that persecution comes to pass, no question, by the devil's agency, but not by the devil's origination. Satan will not be at liberty to do anything against the servants of the living God unless the Lord grant leave, either that He may overthrow Satan himself by the faith of the elect which proves victorious in the trial, or in the face of the world show that apostatizers to the devil's cause have been in reality His servants. You have the case of Job, whom the devil, unless he had received authority from God, could not have visited with trial, not even, in fact, in his property, unless the Lord had said, \"Behold, all that he has I put at your disposal; but do not stretch out your hand against himself.\"[fn-19-P1938_573046:6-nf] In short, he would not even have stretched it out, unless afterwards, at his request, the Lord had granted him this permission also, saying, \"Behold, I deliver him to you; only preserve his life.\" So he asked in the case of the apostles likewise an opportunity to tempt them, having it only by special allowance, since the Lord in the Gospel says to Peter, \"Behold, Satan asked that he might sift you as grain; but I have prayed for you that your faith fail not; \"[fn-19-P1939_573525:7-nf] that is, that the devil should not have power granted him sufficient to endanger his faith. Whence it is manifest that both things belong to God shaking of faith as well as the shielding of it, when both are sought from Him-the shaking by the devil, the shielding by the Son. And certainly, when the Son of God has faith's protection absolutely committed to Him, beseeching it of the Father, from whom He receives all power in heaven and on earth, how entirely out of the question is it that the devil should have the assailing of it in his own power! But in the prayer prescribed to us, when we say to our Father, \"Lead us not into temptation \"[fn-19-P1940_574193:8-nf] (now what greater temptation is there than persecution?), we acknowledge that that comes to pass by His will whom we beseech to exempt us from it. For this is what follows, \"But deliver us from the wicked one,\" that is, do not lead us into temptation by giving us up to the wicked one, for then are we delivered from the power of the devil, when we are not handed over to him to be tempted. Nor would the devil's legion have had power over the herd of swine[fn-19-P1941_574668:9-nf] unless they had got it from God; so far are they from having power over the sheep of God. I may say that the bristles of the swine, too, were then counted by God, not to speak of the hairs of holy men. The devil, it must be owned, seems indeed to have power-in this case really his own-over those who do not belong to God, the nations being once for all counted by God as a drop of the bucket, and as the dust of the threshing-floor, and as the spittle of the mouth, and so thrown open to the devil as, in a sense, a free possession. But against those who belong to the household of God he may not do ought as by any right of his own, because the cases marked out in Scripture show when-that is, for what reasons-he may touch them. For either, with a view to their being approved, the power of trial is granted to him, challenged or challenging, as in the instances already referred to, or, to secure an opposite result, the sinner is handed over to him, as though he were an executioner to whom belonged the inflicting of punishment, as in the case of Saul. \"And the Spirit of the Lord,\" says Scripture, \"departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled and stifled him; \"[fn-19-P1942_575871:10-nf] or the design is to humble, as the apostle tells us, that there was given him a stake, the messenger of Satan, to buffet him;[fn-19-P1943_576019:11-nf] and even this son of thing is not permitted in the case of holy men, unless it be that at the same time strength of endurance may be perfected in weakness. For the apostle likewise delivered Phygellus and Hermogenes over to Satan that by chastening they might be taught not to blaspheme.[fn-19-P1944_576327:12-nf] You see, then, that the devil receives more suitably power even from the servants of God; so far is he from having it by any fight of his own.","title":"IX.

One asketh for health, if he is sick; another asketh for deliverance, if he is in prison; another asketh for the port, if he is tossed about at sea; another asketh for victory, if he is in conflict with an enemy; and in the Name of Christ he asketh all, and what he asketh is nothing. What then must be asked for? \"Ask in My Name.\"[fn-68-P6848_2876799:35-nf] And He said not what, but by the very words we understand what we ought to ask. \"Ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.

One may take \"then shall they say among the heathen[fn-19-P1920_1145383:12-nf] ,\" and \"when I sent you[fn-19-P1921_1145426:13-nf] \" and \"then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened[fn-19-P1922_1145500:14-nf] ,\" and countless similar phrases through the whole of Scripture, to prove this point, that the ordinary Scriptural use employs these parts of speech to denote time.

And as this phrase is utterly unreal, unless it rests upon the signification of time, it would be foolish and idle to say that nothing was before the Son, and yet to maintain that the Son did not always exist. For if there is neither place nor time, nor any other creature where the Word that was in the beginning is not, the statement that the Lord \"once was not\" is entirely removed from the region of orthodox doctrine. So he is at variance not so much with us as with himself, who declares that the Only-begotten both was and was not. For in confessing that the conjunction of the Son with the Father is not interrupted by anything, He clearly testifies to His eternity. But if he should say that the Son was not in the Father, we shall not ourselves say anything against such a statement, but shall oppose to it the Scripture which declares that the Son is in the Father, and the Father in the Son, without adding to the phrase \"once\" or \"when\" or \"then,\" but testifying His eternity by this affirmative and unqualified utterance.","title":"Book IX","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":22,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_21_dialogue_iii_the_impassible_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"377","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Orth.-The Ethiopian eunuch had not read much of the Bible, but when he had found one witness from the prophets he was guided by it to salvation.

Yet they are not contrary. For the same Christ is by nature God and man; as God He strengthens them that need consolation; as man He receives consolation through an angel. And although the Godhead and the Spirit were present as an anointing, the body and the soul were not then supported either by the Godhead united to them or by the Holy Ghost, but this service was entrusted to an angel in order to exhibit the infirmity both of the soul and of the body and that through the infirmity might be seen the natures of the infirm. Now these things plainly happened by the permission of the divine nature, that, among them that were to live in future times, believers in the assumption of the soul and of the body might be vindicated by these demonstrations, and their opponents by plain proof convicted. If then the union was effected by the conception, and, as they argue, made both natures one, how could the properties of the natures continue unimpaired, the soul agonize, and the body sweat so as to sweat bloody drops from excess of fear? But if the one is natural to the body and the other to the soul, then the union did not effect one nature of flesh and Godhead, but one Son appeared shewing forth in Himself both the human and the divine.","title":"Demonstrations by Syllogisms","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":22,"verse":33,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_114_sermon_xcvii_cxlvii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"1.

Nevertheless I fear and tremble, not indeed distressed for the sake of you who are noble champions of the truth, but because I know that it comes to pass that some men are of feebler heart. If among twelve apostles one was found a traitor, there is no doubt that among a number many times as great any one might easily discover many falling short of perfection.

For it would be preposterous that he should enjoy the dignity of his command, and, in the hour of need, run out of danger's way. Thus the thrice blessed prophets ever acted, making light of the safety of their bodies, and, for the sake of the Jews who hated and rejected them, underwent all kinds of peril and toil. Of them the divine apostle says \"they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain by the sword; they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world was not worthy; they wandered in deserts and mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.\"[fn-57-P5715_1396536:123-nf] Thus the divine apostles travelled preaching over all the world, without home, bed, bedding, board, or any of the necessaries of life, but scourged, racked, imprisoned, and undergoing countless kinds of death. And all this they underwent, not for the sake of their friends, but voluntarily facing these perils for the sake of the men who were persecuting them. A far stronger claim is made on you now to accept the peril at present assailing you, for the sake of fellow-believers and brothers and children. This affection is shown even by unreasoning animals, for sparrows may be seen fighting with all their force in behalf of their brood, and putting out in their defence all the strength they have; other kinds of birds moreover undergo danger for their young. But why do I speak of birds? Bears too, and leopards, wolves, and lions, voluntarily suffer any pain for the safety of their offspring, for instead of fleeing from the hunter they will await his attack and do battle for their young.","title":"Letters of the Blessed Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":22,"verse":31,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_23_letters_of_the_blessed_theodoret_bishop_of_cyrus","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"349","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"I write thus not to inform you but to remind you.

Then, having taken the bread and given it to His disciples, He made it His own body, by saying, \"This is my body,\"[fn-69-P6957_2024134:1600-nf] that is, the figure of my body.

He likewise, when mentioning the cup and making the new testament to be sealed \"in His blood,\"[fn-69-P6964_2026008:1607-nf] affirms the reality of His body. For no blood can belong to a body which is not a body of flesh. If any sort of body were presented to our view, which is not one of flesh, not being fleshly, it would not possess blood. Thus, from the evidence of the flesh, we get a proof of the body, and a proof of the flesh from the evidence of the blood. In order, however, that you may discover how anciently wine is used as a figure for blood, turn to Isaiah, who asks, \"Who is this that cometh from Edom, from Bosor with garments dyed in red, so glorious in His apparel, in the greatness of his might?

Much more clearly still does the book of Genesis foretell this, when (in the blessing of Judah, out of whose tribe Christ was to come according to the flesh) it even then delineated Christ in the person of that patriarch,[fn-69-P6966_2027407:1609-nf] saying, \"He washed His garments in wine, and His clothes in the blood of grapes\"[fn-69-P6967_2027506:1610-nf] -in His garments and clothes the prophecy pointed out his flesh, and His blood in the wine.

Matthew proceeds thus: \"Then one of the twelve, who is called Judas [of] Scarioth, went unto the chief priests, and said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver Him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver;\" and so on down to the words, \"And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them, and they made ready the passover.\"[fn-22-P2218_936931:557-nf] Nothing in this section can be supposed to stand in any contradiction with the versions of Mark and Luke, who record this same passage in a similar manner.[fn-22-P2219_937113:558-nf] For as regards the statement given by Matthew in these terms, \"Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand: I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples,\"[fn-22-P2220_937363:559-nf] it just indicates the person whom Mark and Luke name the \"goodman of the house,\"[fn-22-P2221_937467:560-nf] or the \"master of the house,\"[fn-22-P2222_937521:561-nf] in which the dining-room was shown them where they were to make ready the passover. And Matthew has expressed this by simply bringing in the phrase, \"to such a man,\" as a brief explanation introduced by himself with the view of succinctly giving us to understand who the person referred to was. For if he had said that the Lord addressed them in words like these: \"Go into the city, and say unto him [or \"it \"],[fn-22-P2223_937955:562-nf] The Master saith, My time is at hand, I will keep the passover at thy house,\" it might have been supposed that the terms were intended to be directed to the city itself. For this reason, therefore, Matthew has inserted the statement, that the Lord bade them go \"to such a man,\" not, however, as a statement made by the Lord, whose instructions he was recording, but simply as one volunteered by himself, with the view of avoiding the necessity of narrating the whole at length, when it seemed to him that this was all that required to be mentioned in order to bring out with sufficient accuracy what was really meant by the person who gave the order. For who can fail to see that no one naturally speaks to others in such an indefinite fashion as this, \"Go ye to such a man\"? If, again, the words had been, \"Go ye to any one whatsoever,\" or \"to any one you please,\"[fn-22-P2224_939021:563-nf] the mode of expression might have been correct enough, but the person to whom the disciples were sent would have been left uncertain: whereas Mark and Luke present him as a certain definitely indicated individual, although they pass over his name in silence. The Lord Himself, we may be sure, knew to what person it was that He despatched them. And in order that those also whom He was thus sending might be able to discover the individual meant, He gave them, before they set out, a particular sign which they were to follow,-namely, the appearance of a man bearing a pitcher or a vessel of water,-and told them, that if they went after him, they would reach the house which He intended. Hence, seeing that it was not competent here to employ the phraseology,\" Go to any one you please,\" which is indeed legitimate enough, so far as the demands of linguistic propriety are concerned, but which an accurate statement of the matter dealt with here renders inadmissible in this passage, with how much less warrant could an expression like this have been used here (by the speaker Himself), \"Go to such a man,\" which the usage of correct language can never admit at all? But it is manifest that the disciples were sent by the Lord, plainly, not to any man they pleased, but to \"such a man,\" that is to say, to a certain definite individual. And that is a thing which the evangelist, speaking in his own person, could quite rightly have related to us, by putting it in this way: \"He sent them to such a man,[fn-22-P2225_940564:564-nf] in order to say to him, I will keep the passover at thy house.\" He might also have expressed it thus: \"He sent them to such a man, saying, Go, say to him, I will keep the passover at thy house.\" And thus it is that, after giving us the words actually spoken by the Lord Himself, namely, \"Go into the city,\" he has introduced this addition of his own, \"to such a man,\" which he does, however, not as if the Lord had thus expressed Himself, but simply with the view of giving us to understand, although the name is left unrecorded, that there was a particular person in the city to whom the Lord's disciples were sent, in order to make ready the passover. Thus, too, after the two [or three] words brought in that manner as an explanation of his own, he takes up again the order of the words as they were uttered by the Lord Himself, namely, \"And say unto him, The Master saith.\" And if you ask now \"to whom\" they were to say this, the correct reply is given [at once] in these terms, To that particular man to whom the evangelist has given us to understand that the Lord sent them, when, speaking in His own person, he introduced the clause, \"to such a man.\" The clause thus inserted may indeed contain a rather unusual mode of expression, but still it is a perfectly legitimate phraseology when it is thus understood. Or it may be, that in the Hebrew language, in which Matthew is reported to have written, there is some peculiar usage which might make it entirely accordant with the laws of correct expression, even were the whole taken to have been spoken by the Lord Himself. Whether that is the case, those who understand that tongue may decide. Even in the Latin language itself, indeed, this kind of expression might also be used, in terms like these: \"Go into the city to such a man as may be indicated by a person who shall meet you carrying a pitcher of water.\" If the instructions were conveyed in such words as these, they could be acted upon without any ambiguity. Or again, if the terms were anything like these, \"Go into the city to such a man, who resides in this or the other place, in such and such a house,\" then the note thus given of the place and the designation of the house would make it quite possible to understand the commission delivered, and to execute it. But when these instructions, and all others of a similar order, are left entirely untold, the person who in such circumstances uses this kind of address, \"Go to such a man, and say unto him,\" cannot possibly be listened to intelligently for this obvious reason, that when he employs the terms, \"to such a man,\" he intends a certain particular individual to be understood by them, and yet offers us no hint by which he may be identified. But if we are to suppose that the clause referred to is one introduced as an explanation by the evangelist himself, [we may find that] the requirements of brevity will render the expression somewhat obscure, without, however, making it incorrect.

And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver;\" and so on down to the words, \"And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them, and they made ready the passover.\"[fn-22-P2218_936931:557-nf] Nothing in this section can be supposed to stand in any contradiction with the versions of Mark and Luke, who record this same passage in a similar manner.[fn-22-P2219_937113:558-nf] For as regards the statement given by Matthew in these terms, \"Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand: I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples,\"[fn-22-P2220_937363:559-nf] it just indicates the person whom Mark and Luke name the \"goodman of the house,\"[fn-22-P2221_937467:560-nf] or the \"master of the house,\"[fn-22-P2222_937521:561-nf] in which the dining-room was shown them where they were to make ready the passover. And Matthew has expressed this by simply bringing in the phrase, \"to such a man,\" as a brief explanation introduced by himself with the view of succinctly giving us to understand who the person referred to was. For if he had said that the Lord addressed them in words like these: \"Go into the city, and say unto him [or \"it \"],[fn-22-P2223_937955:562-nf] The Master saith, My time is at hand, I will keep the passover at thy house,\" it might have been supposed that the terms were intended to be directed to the city itself. For this reason, therefore, Matthew has inserted the statement, that the Lord bade them go \"to such a man,\" not, however, as a statement made by the Lord, whose instructions he was recording, but simply as one volunteered by himself, with the view of avoiding the necessity of narrating the whole at length, when it seemed to him that this was all that required to be mentioned in order to bring out with sufficient accuracy what was really meant by the person who gave the order. For who can fail to see that no one naturally speaks to others in such an indefinite fashion as this, \"Go ye to such a man\"? If, again, the words had been, \"Go ye to any one whatsoever,\" or \"to any one you please,\"[fn-22-P2224_939021:563-nf] the mode of expression might have been correct enough, but the person to whom the disciples were sent would have been left uncertain: whereas Mark and Luke present him as a certain definitely indicated individual, although they pass over his name in silence. The Lord Himself, we may be sure, knew to what person it was that He despatched them. And in order that those also whom He was thus sending might be able to discover the individual meant, He gave them, before they set out, a particular sign which they were to follow,-namely, the appearance of a man bearing a pitcher or a vessel of water,-and told them, that if they went after him, they would reach the house which He intended. Hence, seeing that it was not competent here to employ the phraseology,\" Go to any one you please,\" which is indeed legitimate enough, so far as the demands of linguistic propriety are concerned, but which an accurate statement of the matter dealt with here renders inadmissible in this passage, with how much less warrant could an expression like this have been used here (by the speaker Himself), \"Go to such a man,\" which the usage of correct language can never admit at all? But it is manifest that the disciples were sent by the Lord, plainly, not to any man they pleased, but to \"such a man,\" that is to say, to a certain definite individual. And that is a thing which the evangelist, speaking in his own person, could quite rightly have related to us, by putting it in this way: \"He sent them to such a man,[fn-22-P2225_940564:564-nf] in order to say to him, I will keep the passover at thy house.\" He might also have expressed it thus: \"He sent them to such a man, saying, Go, say to him, I will keep the passover at thy house.\" And thus it is that, after giving us the words actually spoken by the Lord Himself, namely, \"Go into the city,\" he has introduced this addition of his own, \"to such a man,\" which he does, however, not as if the Lord had thus expressed Himself, but simply with the view of giving us to understand, although the name is left unrecorded, that there was a particular person in the city to whom the Lord's disciples were sent, in order to make ready the passover. Thus, too, after the two [or three] words brought in that manner as an explanation of his own, he takes up again the order of the words as they were uttered by the Lord Himself, namely, \"And say unto him, The Master saith.\" And if you ask now \"to whom\" they were to say this, the correct reply is given [at once] in these terms, To that particular man to whom the evangelist has given us to understand that the Lord sent them, when, speaking in His own person, he introduced the clause, \"to such a man.\" The clause thus inserted may indeed contain a rather unusual mode of expression, but still it is a perfectly legitimate phraseology when it is thus understood. Or it may be, that in the Hebrew language, in which Matthew is reported to have written, there is some peculiar usage which might make it entirely accordant with the laws of correct expression, even were the whole taken to have been spoken by the Lord Himself. Whether that is the case, those who understand that tongue may decide. Even in the Latin language itself, indeed, this kind of expression might also be used, in terms like these: \"Go into the city to such a man as may be indicated by a person who shall meet you carrying a pitcher of water.\" If the instructions were conveyed in such words as these, they could be acted upon without any ambiguity. Or again, if the terms were anything like these, \"Go into the city to such a man, who resides in this or the other place, in such and such a house,\" then the note thus given of the place and the designation of the house would make it quite possible to understand the commission delivered, and to execute it. But when these instructions, and all others of a similar order, are left entirely untold, the person who in such circumstances uses this kind of address, \"Go to such a man, and say unto him,\" cannot possibly be listened to intelligently for this obvious reason, that when he employs the terms, \"to such a man,\" he intends a certain particular individual to be understood by them, and yet offers us no hint by which he may be identified. But if we are to suppose that the clause referred to is one introduced as an explanation by the evangelist himself, [we may find that] the requirements of brevity will render the expression somewhat obscure, without, however, making it incorrect. Moreover, as to the fact, that where Mark speaks of a pitcher[fn-22-P2226_943615:565-nf] of water, Luke mentions a vessel,[fn-22-P2227_943673:566-nf] the simple explanation is, that the one has used a word indicative of the kind of vessel, and the other a term indicative of its capacity, while both evangelists have nevertheless preserved the real meaning actually intended.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":82,"source_paragraph":"324","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"158.

These considerations may constrain us rather to understand the narratives really to import that the man uttered his presumptuous declaration thrice over, as it was called forth by different occasions in the series of Christ's discourses, and that also three several times the answer was returned him by the Lord, which intimated that before the cock crew he would deny Him thrice.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":31,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"36","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"5. \"Little children, yet a little while I am with you.

And surely there is nothing incredible in supposing that Peter was moved to such an act of presumption on several occasions, separated from each other by certain intervals of time, as he was actually instigated to deny Him repeatedly. Neither should it seem unreasonable to fancy that the Lord gave him a reply in similar terms at three successive periods, especially when [we see that] in immediate connection with each other, and without the interposition of anything else either in fact or word, Christ addressed the question to him three several times whether he loved Him, and that, when Peter returned the same answer thrice over, He also gave him thrice over the self-same charge to feed His sheep.[fn-22-P2267_957238:19-nf] That it is the more reasonable thing to suppose that Peter displayed his presumption on three different occasions, and that thrice over he received from the Lord a warning with respect to his triple denial, is further proved, as we may see, by the very terms employed by the evangelists, which record sayings uttered by the Lord in diverse form and of diverse import. Let us here call attention again to that passage which I introduced a little ago from the Gospel of John. There we certainly find that He had expressed Himself in this way \"Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you. A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another. Simon Peter saith unto Him, Lord, whither goest Thou?\"[fn-22-P2268_958198:20-nf] Now, surely it is evident here that what moved Peter to utter this question, \"Lord, whither goest Thou?\" was the words which the Lord Himself had spoken. For he had heard Him say, \"Whither I go, ye cannot come.\" Then Jesus made this reply to the said Peter: \"Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now, but thou shall follow me afterwards.\" Thereupon Peter expressed himself thus: \"Lord, why cannot I follow Thee now? I will lay down my life for Thy sake.\"[fn-22-P2269_958678:21-nf] And to this presumptuous declaration the Lord responded by predicting his denial. Luke, again, first mentions how the Lord said, \"Simon, behold Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not; and, when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren:\" next he proceeds immediately to tell us how Peter replied to this effect: \"Lord, I am ready to go with Thee, both unto prison and to death;\" and then he continues thus: \"And He said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.\"[fn-22-P2270_959309:22-nf] Now, who can fail to perceive that this is an occasion by itself, and that the incident in connection with which Peter was incited to make the presumptuous declaration already referred to is an entirely different one? But, once more, Matthew presents us with the following passage: \"And when they had sung an hymn,\" he says, \"they went out into the Mount of Olives. Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.\"[fn-22-P2271_959941:23-nf] The same passage is given in precisely the same form by Mark.[fn-22-P2272_960027:24-nf] What similarity is there, however, in these words, or in the ideas expressed by them, either to the terms in which John represents Peter to have made his presumptuous declaration, or to those in which Luke exhibits him as uttering such an asseveration? And so we find that in Matthew's narrative the connection proceeds immediately thus: \"Peter answered and said unto Him, Though all men shall be offended because of Thee, yet will I never be offended. Jesus saith unto him, Verily, I say unto thee, that this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. Peter saith unto him, Though I should die with Thee, yet will I not deny Thee. Likewise also said all His disciples.\"[fn-22-P2273_960734:25-nf] ","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":39,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"43","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"10. Matthew then proceeds with his narrative in the same connection as follows: \"Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane.\"[fn-22-P2294_974789:38-nf] This is mentioned also by Mark.[fn-22-P2295_974845:39-nf] Luke, too, refers to it, although he does not notice the piece of ground by name. For he says: \"And He came out, and went, as was His wont, to the Mount of Olives; and His disciples also followed Him. And when He was at the place, He said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.\"[fn-22-P2296_975158:40-nf] That is the place which the other two have instanced under the name of Gethsemane. There, we understand, was the garden which John brings into notice when he gives the following narration: \"When Jesus had spoken these words, He went forth with His disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which He entered, and His disciples.\"[fn-22-P2297_975529:41-nf] Then taking Matthew's record, we get this statement next in order: \"He said unto His disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.[fn-22-P2298_975686:42-nf] And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. Then saith He unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me. And He went a little farther, and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt. And He cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What! could ye not watch with me one hour? Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me except I drink it, Thy will be done. And He came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy. And He left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. Then cometh He to His disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners.

But it was not when he was outside at the gate that he denied the Lord the second time. That took place after he had come back to the fire-place. There was no need, however, to mention the precise time at which he did thus return. Consequently Mark goes on with his narrative of the incident in these terms: \"And he went out into the porch, and the cock crew. And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them. And he denied it again.\"[fn-23-P2354_1002030:81-nf] This is not the same maid, however, as the former one, but another, as Matthew tells us. Nay, we gather further that on the occasion of the second denial he was addressed by two parties, namely, by the maid who is mentioned by Matthew and Mark, and also by another person who is noticed by Luke. For Luke's account runs in this style: \"And Peter followed afar off. And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were sat down together, Peter sat down among them. But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him. And he denied Him, saying, Woman, I know Him not. And after a little while, another saw him, and said, \"Thou art also of them.\"[fn-23-P2355_1002781:82-nf] Now the clause, \"And after a little while,\" which Luke introduces, covers the period during which [we may suppose that] Peter went out and the first cock crew. By this time, however, he had come in again; and thus we can understand the consistency of John's narrative, which informs us that he denied the Lord the second time as he stood by the fire. For in his version of Peter's first denial, John not only says nothing about the first crowing of the cock (which holds good of the other evangelists, too, with the exception of Mark), but also leaves unnoticed the fact that it was as he sat by the fire that the maid recognised him. For all that John says there is this, \"Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.\"[fn-23-P2356_1003599:83-nf] Then he brings in the statement which he deemed it right to make on the subject of what took place with Jesus in that same house. His record of this is to the following effect: \"And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals, for it was cold. And they warmed themselves; and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.\"[fn-23-P2357_1003964:84-nf] Here, therefore, we may suppose Peter to have gone out, and by this time to have come in again. For at first he was sitting by the fire; and after a space, as we gather, he had returned, and commenced to stand [by the hearth].","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":59,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"60","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"25. Accordingly, let us next examine into the consistency of the evangelists so far as the third denial is concerned, which we have previously instanced in the statement given by Matthew only. Mark then goes on with his version in these terms: \"And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them; for thou art a Galilaean. But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak. And immediately the second time the cock crew.\"[fn-23-P2366_1010164:91-nf] Luke, again, continues his narrative, relating the same incident in this fashion: \"And about the space of one hour after, another confidently affirmed, Of a truth this fellow also was with him; for he is a Galilaean. And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately while he yet spake the cock crew.\"[fn-23-P2367_1010504:92-nf] John follows with his account of Peter's third denial, which is thus given: \"One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him? Peter then denied again; and immediately the cock crew.\"[fn-23-P2368_1010796:93-nf] Now what precise period of time is meant under the phrase, \"a little after,\" which is employed by Matthew and Mark, is made clear by Luke, when he says, \"And about the space of one hour after.\" John, however, conveys no intimation of this space of time. Again, with respect to the circumstance that Matthew and Mark use the plural number instead of the singular, and speak of the persons who were engaged with Peter, while Luke mentions only a single individual, and John, too, specifies but one, particularizing him further as kinsman to him whose ear Peter cut off; we may easily explain it either by understanding Matthew and Mark to have adopted a familiar method of speech here in employing the plural number simply instead of the singular, or by supposing that one of the persons present-one who knew Peter and had seen him-took the lead in making the declaration, and that the rest, imitating his confidence, joined him in pressing the assertion upon Peter. If this is the case, then two of the evangelists have given the general statement, using simply the plural number; while the other two have preferred to particularize only the one special individual who played the chief part in the transaction. But, once more, Matthew affirms that the words, \"Surely thou also art one of them, for thy speech bewrayeth thee,\" were spoken to Peter himself. In like manner, John tells us that the question, \"Did not I see thee in the garden with him?\" was addressed directly to Peter. But Mark, on the other hand, gives us to understand that the sentence, \"Surely he is one of them, for he is also a Galilaean,\" was what those who stood by said to each other about Peter. And, in the same way, Luke indicates that the declaration uttered by the other person, who said, \"Of a truth, this fellow also was with him, for he is a Galilaean,\" was not addressed to Peter, but was made regarding Peter. These variations, however, may be explained either by understanding the evangelists, who speak of Peter as the person directly addressed, to have fairly reproduced the general sense, inasmuch as what was spoken about the man in his own presence was much the same as if it had been spoken immediately to him; or by supposing that both these methods of address were actually practised, and that the one has been noticed by the former evangelists, and the other by the latter. Moreover, we take the second cockcrowing to have occurred after the third denial, as Mark has expressly informed us.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":61,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"61","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"26. Matthew then proceeds with his narrative in these terms: \"And Peter remembered the word of Jesus which He had said unto him, Before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out and wept bitterly.\"[fn-23-P2370_1013516:94-nf] Mark, again, gives it thus: \"And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus had said unto him, Before the cock crow twice thou shall deny me thrice. And he began to weep.\"[fn-23-P2371_1013707:95-nf] Luke's version is as follows: \"And the Lord turned and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said unto him, Before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice. And Peter went out and wept bitterly.\"[fn-23-P2372_1014223:96-nf] John says nothing about Peter's recollection and weeping. Now, the statement made here by Luke, to the effect that \"the Lord turned and looked upon Peter,\" is one which requires more careful consideration, with a view to its correct acceptance. For although there are also inner halls (or courts), so named, it was in the outer court (or hall) that Peter appeared on this occasion among the servants, who were warming themselves along with him at the fire. And it is not a credible supposition that Jesus was heard by the Jews in this place, so that we might also understand the look referred to have been a look with the bodily eye. For Matthew presents us first with this narrative: \"Then did they spit in His face and buffeted Him; and others smote Him with the palms of their hands, saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, who is he that smote thee?\"[fn-23-P2373_1015101:97-nf] And then he follows this up immediately with the paragraph about Peter: \"Now Peter sat without in the palace.\"[fn-23-P2374_1015237:98-nf] He would not, however, have used this latter expression, had it not been the case that the things previously alluded to were done to the Lord inside the house. And, indeed, as we gather from Mark's version, these things took place not simply in the interior, but also in the upper parts of the house. For, after recording the said circumstances, Mark goes on thus: \"And as Peter was beneath in the palace.\"[fn-23-P2375_1015790:99-nf] Thus, as Matthew's words, \"Now Peter sat without in the palace,\" show us that the things previously mentioned took place inside the house, so Mark's words, \"And as Peter was beneath in the palace,\" indicate that they were done not only in the interior, but in the upper parts of the house. But if this is the case, how could the Lord have looked on Peter with the actual glance of the bodily eye? These considerations bring me to the conclusion, that the look in question was one cast upon Peter from Heaven, the effect of which was to bring up before his mind the number of times he had now denied [his Master], and the declaration which the Lord had made to him prophetically, and in this way (the Lord thus looking mercifully upon him[fn-23-P2376_1016549:100-nf] ), to lead him to repent, and to weep salutary tears. The expression, therefore, will be a parallel to other modes of speech which we employ daily, as when we thus pray, \"Lord, look upon me;\" or as when, in reference to one who has been delivered by the divine mercy from some danger or trouble, we say that the \"Lord looked upon him.\" In the Scriptures, also, we find such words as these: \"Look upon me and hear me;[fn-23-P2377_1017005:101-nf] and \"Return,[fn-23-P2378_1017038:102-nf] O Lord, and deliver my soul.\"[fn-23-P2379_1017085:103-nf] And, according to my judgment, a similar view is to be taken of the expression adopted here, when it is said that \"the Lord turned and looked upon Peter; and Peter remembered the word of the Lord.\" Finally, we have to notice how, while it is the more usual practice with the evangelists to employ the name \"Jesus\" in preference to the word \"Lord\" in their narratives, Luke has used the latter term exclusively in the said sentence, saying expressly, \"The `Lord' turned and looked upon Peter; and Peter remembered the word of the `Lord:'\" whereas Matthew and Mark have passed over this \"look\" in silence, and consequently have said that Peter remembered not the word of the \"Lord,\" but the word of \"Jesus.\" From this, therefore, we may gather that the \"look\" thus proceeding from Jesus was not one with the eyes of the human body, but a look cast from Heaven.[fn-23-P2380_1017962:104-nf] ","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"71","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"34. Luke gives the following version of what took place in presence of Pilate: \"And they began to accuse Him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ a king.\"[fn-24-P2415_1041496:127-nf] The previous two evangelists have not recorded these words, although they do mention the fact that these parties accused Him. Luke is thus the one who has specified the terms of the false accusations which were brought against Him. On the other hand, he does not state that Pilate said to Him, \"Answerest thou nothing? behold, how many things they witness against thee.\" Instead of introducing these sentences, Luke goes on to relate other matters which are also reported by these two. Thus he continues: \"And Pilate asked Him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And He answered him and said, Thou sayest.\" Matthew and Mark have likewise inserted this fact, previous to the statement that Jesus was taken to task for not answering His accusers. The truth, however, is not at all affected by the order in which Luke has narrated these things; and as little is it affected by the mere circumstance that one writer passes over some incident without notice, which another expressly specifies. We have an instance in what follows; namely, \"Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man. And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place. But when Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilean. And as soon as he knew that He belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time. And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad; for he was desirous to see Him of a long season, because he had heard many things of Him, and he hoped to see some miracle done by Him. Then he questioned with Him in many words; but He answered him nothing. And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused Him. And Herod with his men of war set Him at nought, and mocked Him, and arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe, and sent Him again to Pilate. And the same day Herod and Pilate were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.\"[fn-24-P2416_1043564:128-nf] All these things are related by Luke alone, namely, the fact that the Lord was sent by Pilate to Herod, and the account of what took place on that occasion. At the same time, among the statements which he makes in this passage, there are some bearing a resemblance to matters which may be found reported by the other evangelists in connection with different portions of their narrations. But the immediate object of these others, however, was to recount simply the various things which were done in Pilate's presence on to the time when the Lord was delivered over to be crucified. In accordance with his own plan, however, Luke makes the above digression with the view of telling what occurred with Herod; and after that he reverts to the history of what took place in the governor's presence. Thus he now continues as follows: \"And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him.\"[fn-24-P2417_1044717:129-nf] Here we notice that he has omitted to mention how Pilate asked the Lord what answer He had to make to His accusers. Thereafter he proceeds in these terms: \"No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him: and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him. I will therefore chastise him and release him. For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast. And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas; who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison. Pilate, therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them. But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him and let him go. And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that He might be crucified; and the voices of them[fn-24-P2418_1045643:130-nf] prevailed.\"[fn-24-P2419_1045806:131-nf] The repeated effort which Pilate, in his desire to accomplish the release of Jesus, thus made to gain the people's consent, is satisfactorily attested by Matthew, although in a very few words, when he says, \"But when Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made.\" For he would not have made such a statement at all, had not Pilate exerted himself earnestly in that direction, although at the same time he has not told us how often he made such attempts to rescue Jesus from their fury. Accordingly, Luke concludes his report of what took place in the governor's presence in this fashion: \"And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required. And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.\"[fn-24-P2420_1046652:132-nf] ","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":51,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_117_tractate_cxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"5. \"Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. And the servant's name was Malchus.\" This is the only evangelist who has given us the very name of this servant, as Luke is the only one who tells us that the Lord touched his ear and healed him.[fn-36-P3610_2003767:4-nf] The interpretation of Malchus is, one who is destined to reign. What, then, is signified by the ear that was cut off in the Lord's behalf, and healed by the Lord, but the renewed hearing that has been pruned of its oldness, that it may henceforth be in the newness of the spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter?[fn-36-P3611_2004103:5-nf] Who can doubt that he, who had such a thing done for him by Christ, was yet destined to reign with Christ? And his being found as a servant, pertains also to that oldness that gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.[fn-36-P3612_2004332:6-nf] But when healing came, liberty also was shadowed forth. Peter's deed, however, was disapproved of by the Lord, and He prevented Him from proceeding further by the words: \"Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?\" For in such a deed that disciple only sought to defend his Master, without any thought of what it was intended to signify. And he had therefore to be exhorted to the exercise of patience, and the event itself to be recorded as an exercise of understanding. But when He says that the cup of suffering was given Him by the Father, we have precisely the same truth as that which was uttered by the apostle: \"If God be for us, who can be against us? He that spared not His own Son, but gave Him up for us all.\"[fn-36-P3613_2005122:7-nf] But the originator of this cup is also one with Him who drank it; and hence the same apostle likewise says, \"Christ loved us, and gave Himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God of a sweet-smelling savor.\"[fn-36-P3614_2005357:8-nf] ","title":"Tractate CXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":41,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_24_book_ii_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"71","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"41. \"It is written,\" say they: \"`My Father, if it be possible, take away this cup from Me.'[fn-44-P4464_1149726:60-nf] If, then, He is Almighty, how comes He to doubt of the possibility?\" Which means that, because I have proved Him to be Almighty, I have proved Him unable to doubt of possibility.","title":"Book II.","author":"St. Ambrose"},{"chapter":22,"verse":41,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_24_book_ii_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"71","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"41. \"It is written,\" say they: \"`My Father, if it be possible, take away this cup from Me.'[fn-44-P4464_1149726:60-nf] If, then, He is Almighty, how comes He to doubt of the possibility?\" Which means that, because I have proved Him to be Almighty, I have proved Him unable to doubt of possibility.","title":"Book II.","author":"St. Ambrose"},{"chapter":22,"verse":41,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_24_book_ii_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"71","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"41. \"It is written,\" say they: \"`My Father, if it be possible, take away this cup from Me.'[fn-44-P4464_1149726:60-nf] If, then, He is Almighty, how comes He to doubt of the possibility?\" Which means that, because I have proved Him to be Almighty, I have proved Him unable to doubt of possibility.","title":"Book II.","author":"St. Ambrose"},{"chapter":22,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"39","folder":"ANF-03","text":"In the Creator, however, the two courses were perfectly compatible-both the predestination before the ages and the revelation at the end thereof, because that which He both fore-ordained and revealed He also in the intermediate space of time announced by the pre-ministration of figures, and symbols, and allegories. But because (the apostle) subjoins, on the subject of our glory, that \"none of the princes of this world knew it for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory,\"[fn-74-P7409_2134549:248-nf] the heretic argues that the princes of this world crucified the Lord (that is, the Christ of the rival god) in order that this blow might even recoil[fn-74-P7410_2134720:249-nf] on the Creator Himself. Any one, however, who has seen from what we have already said how our glory must be regarded as issuing from the Creator, will already have come to the conclusion that, inasmuch as the Creator settled it in His own secret purpose, it properly enough was unknown to all the princes[fn-74-P7411_2135051:250-nf] and powers of the Creator, on the principle that servants are not permitted to know their masters' plans, much less the fallen angels and the leader of transgression himself, the devil; for I should contend that these, on account of their fall, were greater strangers still to any knowledge of the Creator's dispensations. But it is no longer open to me[fn-74-P7412_2135424:251-nf] even to interpret the princes and powers of this world as the Creator's, since the apostle imputes ignorance to them, whereas even the devil according to our Gospel recognised Jesus in the temptation,[fn-74-P7413_2135659:252-nf] and, according to the record which is common to both (Marcionites and ourselves) the evil spirit knew that Jesus was the Holy One of God, and that Jesus was His name, and that He was come to destroy them.[fn-74-P7414_2135887:253-nf] The parable also of the strong man armed, whom a stronger than he overcame and seized his goods, is admitted by Marcion to have reference to the Creator:[fn-74-P7415_2136061:254-nf] therefore the Creator could not have been ignorant any longer of the God of glory, since He is overcome by him;[fn-74-P7416_2136219:255-nf] nor could He have crucified him whom He was unable to cope with. The inevitable inference, therefore, as it seems to me, is that we must believe that the princes and powers of the Creator did knowingly crucify the God of glory in His Christ, with that desperation and excessive malice with which the most abandoned slaves do not even hesitate to slay their masters. For it is written in my Gospel[fn-74-P7417_2136672:256-nf] that \"Satan entered into Judas.\"[fn-74-P7418_2136721:257-nf] According to Marcion, however, the apostle in the passage under consideration[fn-74-P7419_2136820:258-nf] does not allow the imputation of ignorance, with respect to the Lord of glory, to the powers of the Creator; because, indeed, he will have it that these are not meant by \"the princes of this world.\" But (the apostle) evidently[fn-74-P7420_2137068:259-nf] did not speak of spiritual princes; so that he meant secular ones, those of the princely people, (chief in the divine dispensation, although) not, of course, amongst the nations of the world, and their rulers, and king Herod, and even Pilate, and, as represented by him,[fn-74-P7421_2137355:260-nf] that power of Rome which was the greatest in the world, and then presided over by him. Thus the arguments of the other side are pulled down, and our own proofs are thereby built up. But you still maintain that our glory comes from your god, with whom it also lay in secret. Then why does your god employ the self-same Scripture[fn-74-P7422_2137698:261-nf] which the apostle also relies on? What has your god to do at all with the sayings of the prophets? \"Who hath discovered the mind of the Lord, or who hath been His counsellor? \"[fn-74-P7423_2137895:262-nf] So says Isaiah. What has he also to do with illustrations from our God? For when (the apostle) calls himself \"a wise master-builder,\"[fn-74-P7424_2138049:263-nf] we find that the Creator by Isaiah designates the teacher who sketches[fn-74-P7425_2138143:264-nf] out the divine discipline by the same title, \"I will take away from Judah the cunning artificer,\"[fn-74-P7426_2138262:265-nf] etc. And was it not Paul himself who was there foretold, destined \"to be taken away from Judah\"-that is, from Judaism-for the erection of Christianity, in order \"to lay that only foundation, which is Christ? \"[fn-74-P7427_2138584:266-nf] Of this work the Creator also by the same prophet says, \"Behold, I lay in Sion for a foundation a precious stone and honourable; and he that resteth thereon shall not be confounded.\"[fn-74-P7428_2138790:267-nf] Unless it be, that God professed Himself to be the builder up of an earthly work, that so He might not give any sign of His Christ, as destined to be the foundation of such as believe in Him, upon which every man should build at will the superstructure of either sound or worthless doctrine; forasmuch as it is the Creator's function, when a man's work shall be tried by fire, (or) when a reward shall be recompensed to him by fire; because it is by fire that the test is applied to the building which you erect upon the foundation which is laid by Him, that is, the foundation of His Christ.[fn-74-P7429_2139407:268-nf] \"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? \"[fn-74-P7430_2140182:269-nf] Now, since man is the property, and the work, and the image and likeness of the Creator, having his flesh, formed by Him of the ground, and his soul of His afflatus, it follows that Marcion's god wholly dwells in a temple which belongs to another, if so be we are not the Creator's temple. But \"if any man defile the temple of God, he shall be himself destroyed\"[fn-74-P7431_2140568:270-nf] -of course, by the God of the temple.[fn-74-P7432_2140658:271-nf] If you threaten an avenger, you threaten us with the Creator. \"Ye must become fools, that ye may be wise.\"[fn-74-P7433_2140788:272-nf] Wherefore? \"Because the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.\"[fn-74-P7434_2140882:273-nf] With what God? Even if the ancient Scriptures have contributed nothing in support of our view thus far,[fn-74-P7435_2141009:274-nf] an excellent testimony turns up in what (the apostle) here adjoins: \"For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness; and again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.\"[fn-74-P7436_2141337:275-nf] For in general we may conclude for certain that he could not possibly have cited the authority of that God whom he was bound to destroy, since he would not teach for Him.[fn-74-P7437_2141560:276-nf] \"Therefore,\" says he, \"let no man glory in man; \"[fn-74-P7438_2141638:277-nf] an injunction which is in accordance with the teaching of the Creator, \"wretched is the man that trusteth in man; \"[fn-74-P7439_2141777:278-nf] again, \"It is better to trust in the Lord than to confide in man; \"[fn-74-P7440_2141866:279-nf] and the same thing is said about glorying (in princes).[fn-74-P7441_2141944:280-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":22,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"44","folder":"ANF-03","text":"\"The head of every man is Christ.\"[fn-75-P7506_2154731:338-nf] What Christ, if He is not the author of man?

Surely of him concerning whom he adds soon afterwards: \"The man ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image of God.\"[fn-75-P7507_2155063:339-nf] Since then he is the image of the Creator (for He, when looking on Christ His Word, who was to become man, said, \"Let us make man in our own image, after our likeness\"[fn-75-P7508_2155252:340-nf] ), how can I possibly have another head but Him whose image I am? For if I am the image of the Creator there is no room in me for another head But wherefore \"ought the woman to have power over her head, because of the angels? \"[fn-75-P7509_2155499:341-nf] If it is because \"she was created for the man,\"[fn-75-P7510_2155569:342-nf] and taken out of the man, according to the Creator's purpose, then in this way too has the apostle maintained the discipline of that God from whose institution he explains the reasons of His discipline. He adds: \"Because of the angels.\"[fn-75-P7511_2155827:343-nf] What angels? In other words, whose angels? If he means the fallen angels of the Creator,[fn-75-P7512_2155938:344-nf] there is great propriety in his meaning. It is right that that face which was a snare to them should wear some mark of a humble guise and obscured beauty. If, however, the angels of the rival god are referred to, what fear is there for them? for not even Marcion's disciples, (to say nothing of his angels, ) have any desire for women. We have often shown before now, that the apostle classes heresies as evil[fn-75-P7513_2156431:345-nf] among \"works of the flesh,\" and that he would have those persons accounted estimable[fn-75-P7514_2156542:346-nf] who shun heresies as an evil thing. In like manner, when treating of the gospel,[fn-75-P7515_2156654:347-nf] we have proved from the sacrament of the bread and the cup[fn-75-P7516_2156753:348-nf] the verity of the Lord's body and blood in opposition to Marcion's phantom; whilst throughout almost the whole of my work it has been contended that all mention of judicial attributes points conclusively to the Creator as to a God who judges. Now, on the subject of \"spiritual gifts,\"[fn-75-P7517_2157084:349-nf] I have to remark that these also were promised by the Creator through Christ; and I think that we may derive from this a very just conclusion that the bestowal of a gift is not the work of a god other than Him who is proved to have given the promise. Here is a prophecy of Isaiah \"There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a flower[fn-75-P7518_2157455:350-nf] shall spring up from his root; and upon Him shall rest the Spirit of the Lord.\" After which he enumerates the special gifts of the same \"The spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of religion.[fn-75-P7519_2157733:351-nf] And with the fear of the Lord[fn-75-P7520_2157801:352-nf] shall the Spirit fill Him.\"[fn-75-P7521_2157867:353-nf] In this figure of a flower he shows that Christ was to arise out of the rod which sprang from the stem of Jesse; in other words, from the virgin of the race of David, the son of Jesse. In this Christ the whole substantia of the Spirit would have to rest, not meaning that it would be as it were some subsequent acquisition accruing to Him who was always, even before His incarnation, the Spirit of God;[fn-75-P7522_2158291:354-nf] so that you cannot argue from this that the prophecy has reference to that Christ who (as mere man of the race only of David) was to obtain the Spirit of his God. (The prophet says, ) on the contrary, that from the time when (the true Christ) should appear in the flesh as the flower predicted,[fn-75-P7523_2158731:355-nf] rising from the root of Jesse, there would have to rest upon Him the entire operation of the Spirit of grace, which, so far as the Jews were concerned, would cease and come to an end. This result the case itself shows; for after this time the Spirit of the Creator never breathed amongst them. From Judah were taken away \"the wise man, and the cunning artificer, and the counsellor, and the prophet; \"[fn-75-P7524_2159162:356-nf] that so it might prove true that \"the law and the prophets were until John.\"[fn-75-P7525_2159266:357-nf] Now hear how he declared that by Christ Himself, when returned to heaven, these spiritual gifts were to be sent: \"He ascended up. on high,\" that is, into heaven; \"He led captivity captive,\" meaning death or slavery of man; \"He gave gifts to the sons of men,\"[fn-75-P7526_2159546:358-nf] that is, the gratuities, which we call charismata. He says specifically \"sons of men,\"[fn-75-P7527_2159690:359-nf] and not men promiscuously; thus exhibiting to us those who were the children of men truly so called, choice men, apostles. \"For,\" says he, \"I have begotten you through the gospel; \"[fn-75-P7528_2159927:360-nf] and \"Ye are my children, of whom I travail again in birth.\"[fn-75-P7529_2160009:361-nf] Now was absolutely fulfilled that promise of the Spirit which was given by the word of Joel: \"In the last days will I pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and their sons and their daughters shall prophesy; and upon my servants and upon my handmaids will I pour out of my Spirit.\"[fn-75-P7530_2160310:362-nf] Since, then, the Creator promised the gift of His Spirit in the latter days; and since Christ has in these last days appeared as the dispenser of spiritual gifts (as the apostle says, \"When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son; \"[fn-75-P7531_2160624:363-nf] and again, \"This I say, brethren, that the time is short\"[fn-75-P7532_2160701:364-nf] ), it evidently follows in connection with this prediction of the last days, that this gift of the Spirit belongs to Him who is the Christ of the predicters. Now compare the Spirit's specific graces, as they are described by the apostle, and promised by the prophet Isaiah. \"To one is given,\" says he, \"by the Spirit the word of wisdom; \"this we see at once is what Isaiah declared to be \"the spirit of wisdom.\" \"To another, the word of knowledge; \"this will be \"the (prophet's) spirit of understanding and counsel.\" \"To another, faith by the same Spirit; \"this will be \"the spirit of religion and the fear of the Lord.\" \"To another, the gifts of healing, and to another the working of miracles; \"this will be \"the spirit of might.\" \"To another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another divers kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues; \"this will be \"the spirit of knowledge.\"[fn-75-P7533_2161674:365-nf] See how the apostle agrees with the prophet both in making the distribution of the one Spirit, and in interpreting His special graces. This, too, I may confidently say: he who has likened the unity of our body throughout its manifold and divers members to the compacting together of the various gifts of the Spirit,[fn-75-P7534_2162038:366-nf] shows also that there is but one Lord of the human body and of the Holy Spirit. This Spirit, (according to the apostle's showing, )[fn-75-P7535_2162223:367-nf] meant not[fn-75-P7536_2162301:368-nf] that the service[fn-75-P7537_2162335:369-nf] of these gifts should be in the body,[fn-75-P7538_2162389:370-nf] nor did He place them in the human body); and on the subject of the superiority of love[fn-75-P7539_2162534:371-nf] above all these gifts, He even taught the apostle that it was the chief commandment,[fn-75-P7540_2162653:372-nf] just as Christ has shown it to be: \"Thou shalt love the Lord with all thine heart and soul,[fn-75-P7541_2162788:373-nf] with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thine own self.\"[fn-75-P7542_2162898:374-nf] When he mentions the fact that \"it is written in the law,\"[fn-75-P7543_2162976:375-nf] how that the Creator would speak with other tongues and other lips, whilst confirming indeed the gift of tongues by such a mention, he yet cannot be thought to have affirmed that the gift was that of another god by his reference to the Creator's prediction.[fn-75-P7544_2163475:376-nf] In precisely the same manner,[fn-75-P7545_2163528:377-nf] when enjoining on women silence in the church, that they speak not for the mere sake[fn-75-P7546_2163627:378-nf] of learning[fn-75-P7547_2163663:379-nf] (although that even they have the right of prophesying, he has already shown[fn-75-P7548_2163767:380-nf] when he covers the woman that prophesies with a veil), he goes to the law for his sanction that woman should be under obedience.[fn-75-P7549_2163940:381-nf] Now this law, let me say once for all, he ought to have made no other acquaintance with, than to destroy it. But that we may now leave the subject of spiritual gifts, facts themselves will be enough to prove which of us acts rashly in claiming them for his God, and whether it is possible that they are opposed to our side, even if[fn-75-P7550_2164330:382-nf] the Creator promised them for His Christ who is not yet revealed, as being destined only for the Jews, to have their operations in His time, in His Christ, and among His people. Let Marcion then exhibit, as gifts of his god, some prophets, such as have not spoken by human sense, but with the Spirit of God, such as have both predicted things to come, and have made manifest[fn-75-P7551_2164765:383-nf] the secrets of the heart;[fn-75-P7552_2164811:384-nf] let him produce a psalm, a vision, a prayer[fn-75-P7553_2164878:385-nf] -only let it be by the Spirit,[fn-75-P7554_2164932:386-nf] in an ecstasy, that is, in a rapture,[fn-75-P7555_2165230:387-nf] whenever an interpretation of tongues has occurred to him; let him show to me also, that any woman of boastful tongue[fn-75-P7556_2165364:388-nf] in his community has ever prophesied from amongst those specially holy sisters of his. Now all these signs (of spiritual gifts) are forthcoming from my side without any difficulty, and they agree, too, with the rules, and the dispensations, and the instructions of the Creator; therefore without doubt the Christ, and the Spirit, and the apostle, belong severally[fn-75-P7557_2165747:389-nf] to my God.

Did not they put Him to death, whom they were here presenting for the very purpose? Or does the cross, forsooth, fail to kill? Such is the folly of those who do not pursue, but persecute wisdom. What then mean the words, \"It is not lawful for us to put any man to death\"? If He is a malefactor, why is it not lawful? Did not the law command them not to spare malefactors, especially (as they accounted Him to be) those who seduced them from their God?[fn-36-P3658_2023820:3-nf] We are, however, to understand that they said that it was not lawful for them to put any man to death, on account of the sanctity of the festal day, which they had just begun to celebrate, and on account of which they were afraid of being defiled even by entering the pretorium. Had you become so hardened, false Israelites? Were you by your excessive malice so lost to all sense, as to imagine that you were unpolluted by the blood of the innocent, because you gave it up to be shed by another? Was even Pilate himself going to slay Him with his own hands, when made over by you into his power for the very purpose? If you did not wish Him to be slain; if you did not lay snares for Him; if you did not get Him to be betrayed to you for money; if you did not lay hands upon Him, and bind Him, and bring Him there; if you did not with your own hands present Him, and with your voices demand Him to be slain,-then boast that He was not put to death by you. But if in addition to all these former deeds of yours, you also cried out, \"Crucify, crucify [him];\"[fn-36-P3659_2025463:4-nf] then hear what it is against you that the prophet proclaims: \"The sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.\"[fn-36-P3660_2025627:5-nf] These, look you, are the spears, the arrows, the sword, wherewith you slew the righteous, when you said that it was not lawful for you to put any man to death. Hence it is also that when for the purpose of apprehending Jesus the chief priests did not themselves come, but sent; yet the evangelist Luke says in the same passage of his narrative, \"Then said Jesus unto those who were come to him, [namely] the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and elders, Be ye come out, as against a thief,\" etc?[fn-36-P3661_2026148:6-nf] As therefore the chief priests went not in their own persons, but by those whom they had sent, to apprehend Jesus, what else was that but coming themselves in the authority of their own order and so all, who cried out with impious voices for the crucifixion of Christ, slew Him, not, indeed, directly with their own hands, but personally through him who was impelled to such a crime by their clamor.","title":"Tractate CXIV","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":32,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_26_book_iv_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"80","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"57.

If our foolish opponents are surprised at the difference between the precepts given by God to the ministers of the Old Testament, at a time when the grace of the New was still undisclosed, and those given to the preachers of the New Testament, now that the obscurity of the Old is removed, they will find Christ Himself saying one thing at one time, and another at another. \"When I sent you,\" He says, \"without scrip, or purse, or shoes, did ye lack anything? And they said, Nothing. Then saith He to them, But now, he that hath a scrip, let him take it, and also a purse; and he that hath not a sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.\" If the Manichaeans found passages in the Old and New Testaments differing in this way, they would proclaim it as a proof that the Testaments are opposed to each other. But here the difference is in the utterances of one and the same person. At one time He says, \"I sent you without scrip, or purse, or shoes, and ye lacked nothing;\" at another, \"Now let him that hath a scrip take it, and also a purse; and he that hath a tunic, let him sell it and buy a sword.\" Does not this show how, without any inconsistency, precepts and counsels and permissions may be changed, as different times require different arrangements? If it is said that there was a symbolical meaning in the command to take a scrip and purse, and to buy a sword, why may there not be a symbolical meaning in the fact, that one and the same God commanded the prophets in old times to make war, and forbade the apostles? And we find in the passage that we have quoted from the Gospel, that the words spoken by the Lord were carried into effect by His disciples. For, besides going at first without scrip or purse, and yet lacking nothing, as from the Lord's question and their answer it is plain they did, now that He speaks of buying a sword, they say, \"Lo, here are two swords;\" and He replied, \"It is enough.\" Hence we find Peter with a weapon when he cut off the assailant's ear, on which occasion his spontaneous boldness was checked, because, although he had been told to take a sword, he had not been told to use it.[fn-22-P2233_1344539:138-nf] Doubtless, it was mysterious that the Lord should require them to carry weapons, and forbid the use of them.

And, to say nothing of other matters, this assuredly ought rather to urge us, that the confession of one word is maintained by the everlasting confession of Christ; as it is written, \"Whosoever shall confess me on earth before men, him also will I confess before my Father, and before His angels.\"[fn-97-P9714_3015264:10-nf] To this are added, by way of an enhancement of glory, the adornments of virtue; for He says, \"The righteous shall shine as sparks that run to and fro among the stubble; they shall judge the nations, and shall have dominion over the peoples.\"[fn-97-P9715_3015525:11-nf] ","title":"On the Glory of Martyrdom.","author":"Cyprian"},{"chapter":22,"verse":42,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_31_the_pearl_seven_hymns_on_the_faith","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"1.

I will not here largely use the support of the other Gospels, which confirm our belief by the Lord's nativity: it is sufficient to remark that He who had to be born of a virgin is announced in express terms by the angel himself as the Son of God: \"The Spirit of God shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also the Holy Thing that shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\"[fn-108-P10814_3033851:359-nf] On this passage even they will wish to raise a cavil; but truth will prevail. Of course, they say, the Son of God is God, and the power of the highest is the Most High. And they do not hesitate to insinuate[fn-108-P10815_3034077:360-nf] what, if it had been true, would have been written. Whom was he[fn-108-P10816_3034156:361-nf] so afraid of as not plainly to declare, \"God shall come upon thee, and the Highest shall overshadow thee? \"Now, by saying \"the Spirit of God\" (although the Spirit of God is God, ) and by not directly naming God, he wished that portion[fn-108-P10817_3034435:362-nf] of the whole Godhead to be understood, which was about to retire into the designation of \"the Son.\" The Spirit of God in this passage must be the same as the Word. For just as, when John says, \"The Word was made flesh,\"[fn-108-P10818_3034811:363-nf] we understand the Spirit also in the mention of the Word: so here, too, we acknowledge the Word likewise in the name of the Spirit. For both the Spirit is the substance of the Word, and the Word is the operation of the Spirit, and the Two are One (and the same).[fn-108-P10819_3035093:364-nf] Now John must mean One when he speaks of Him as \"having been made flesh,\" and the angel Another when he announces Him as \"about to be born,\" if the Spirit is not the Word, and the Word the Spirit. For just as the Word of God is not actually He whose Word He is, so also the Spirit (although He is called God) is not actually He whose Spirit He is said to be. Nothing which belongs to something else is actually the very same thing as that to which it belongs. Clearly, when anything proceeds from a personal subject,[fn-108-P10820_3035989:365-nf] and so belongs to him, since it comes from him, it may possibly be such in quality exactly as the personal subject himself is from whom it proceeds, and to whom it belongs. And thus the Spirit is God, and the Word is God, because proceeding from God, but yet is not actually the very same as He from whom He proceeds. Now that which is God of God, although He is an actually existing thing,[fn-108-P10821_3036396:366-nf] yet He cannot be God Himself[fn-108-P10822_3036449:367-nf] (exclusively), but so far God as He is of the same substance as God Himself, and as being an actually existing thing, and as a portion of the Whole. Much more will \"the power of the Highest\" not be the Highest Himself, because It is not an actually existing thing, as being Spirit-in the same way as the wisdom (of God) and the providence (of God) is not God: these attributes are not substances, but the accidents of the particular substance. Power is incidental to the Spirit, but cannot itself be the Spirit. These things, therefore, whatsoever they are-(I mean) the Spirit of God, and the Word and the Power-having been conferred on the Virgin, that which is born of her is the Son of God. This He Himself, in those other Gospels also, testifies Himself to have been from His very boyhood: \"Wist ye not,\" says He, \"that I must be about my Father's business? \"[fn-108-P10823_3037397:368-nf] Satan likewise knew Him to be this in his temptations: \"Since Thou art the Son of God.\"[fn-108-P10824_3037505:369-nf] This, accordingly, the devils also acknowledge Him to be: \"we know Thee, who Thou art, the Holy Son of God.\"[fn-108-P10825_3037637:370-nf] His \"Father\" He Himself adores.[fn-108-P10826_3037704:371-nf] When acknowledged by Peter as the \"Christ (the Son) of God,\"[fn-108-P10827_3037815:372-nf] He does not deny the relation. He exults in spirit when He says to the Father, \"I thank Thee, O Father, because Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent.\"[fn-108-P10828_3038004:373-nf] He, moreover, affirms also that to no man is the Father known, but to His Son;[fn-108-P10829_3038104:374-nf] and promises that, as the Son of the Father, He will confess those who confess Him, and deny those who deny Him, before His Father.[fn-108-P10830_3038269:375-nf] He also introduces a parable of the mission to the vineyard of the Son (not the Father), who was sent after so many servants,[fn-108-P10831_3038419:376-nf] and slain by the husbandmen, and avenged by the Father. He is also ignorant of the last day and hour, which is known to the Father only.[fn-108-P10832_3038582:377-nf] He awards the kingdom to His disciples, as He says it had been appointed to Himself by the Father.[fn-108-P10833_3038704:378-nf] He has power to ask, if He will, legions of angels from the Father for His help.[fn-108-P10834_3038807:379-nf] He exclaims that God had forsaken Him.[fn-108-P10835_3038869:380-nf] He commends His spirit into the hands of the Father.[fn-108-P10836_3038946:381-nf] After His resurrection He promises in a pledge to His disciples that He will send them the promise of His Father;[fn-108-P10837_3039083:382-nf] and lastly, He commands them to baptize into the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, not into a unipersonal God.[fn-108-P10838_3039221:383-nf] And indeed it is not once only, but three times, that we are immersed into the Three Persons, at each several mention of Their names.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":22,"verse":46,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":32,"source_paragraph":"96","folder":"ANF-03","text":"However, if you persist in pushing your views further, I shall find means of answering you with greater stringency, and of meeting you with the exclamation of the Lord Himself, so as to challenge you with the question, What is your inquiry and reasoning about that?

But this was the voice of flesh and soul, that is to say, of man-not of the Word and Spirit, that is to say, not of God; and it was uttered so as to prove the impassibility of God, who \"forsook\" His Son, so far as He handed over His human substance to the suffering of death.

For it is your fault that you are evil; and it is a greater fault to be unwilling to be rebuked because you are evil, as if faults should either be praised, or regarded with indifference so as neither to be praised nor blamed, or as if, indeed, the dread, or the shame or the mortification of the rebuked man were of no avail, or were of any other avail in healthfully stimulating, except to cause that He who is good may be besought, and so out of evil men who are rebuked may make good men who may be praised. For what he who will not be rebuked desires to be done for him, when he says, \"Pray for me rather,\"-he must be rebuked for that very reason that he may himself also do for himself; because that mortification with which he is dissatisfied with himself when he feels the sting of rebuke, stirs him up to a desire for more earnest prayer,[fn-63-P6367_2438488:26-nf] that, by God's mercy, he may be aided by the increase of love, and cease to do things which are shameful and mortifying, and do things praiseworthy and gladdening.

Because by the Holy Spirit their will is so much enkindled that they therefore can, because they so will; and they therefore so will because God works in them to will. For if in so much weakness of this life (in which weakness, however, for the sake of checking pride, strength behoved to be perfected) their own will should be left to themselves, that they might, if they willed, continue in the help of God, without which they could not persevere, and God should not work in them to will, in the midst of so many and so great weaknesses their will itself would give way, and they would not be able to persevere, for the reason that failing from infirmity they would not will, or in the weakness of will they would not so will that they would be able.

Thus it happens that man's will, weak and incapable, in good as yet small, may persevere by God's strength; while the will of the first man, strong and healthful, having the power of free choice, did not persevere in a greater good; because although God's help was not wanting, without which it could not persevere if it would, yet it was not such a help as that by which God would work in man to will. Certainly to the strongest He yielded and permitted to do what He willed; to those that were weak He has reserved that by His own gift they should most invincibly will what is good, and most invincibly refuse to forsake this. Therefore when Christ says, \"I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not,\"[fn-65-P6574_2512051:140-nf] we may understand that it was said to him who is built upon the rock.

For when the Lord is known, our spirit, having been\" looked back upon\"[fn-112-P11287_3198292:15-nf] by its own Author, emerges unbidden into the knowledge of the truth; and being admitted to (an acquaintance with) the divine precepts, is by them forthwith instructed that \"that from which God bids us abstain is to be accounted sin: \"inasmuch as, since it is generally agreed that God is some great essence of good, of course nothing but evil would be displeasing to good; in that, between things mutually contrary, friendship there is none. Still it will not be irksome briefly to touch upon the fact[fn-112-P11288_3198814:16-nf] that, of sins, some are carnal, that is, corporeal; some spiritual. For since man is composed of this combination of a two-fold substance, the sources of his sins are no other than the sources of his composition. But it is not the fact that body and spirit are two things that constitute the sins mutually different-otherwise they are on this account rather equal, because the two make up one-lest any make the distinction between their sins proportionate to the difference between their substances, so as to esteem the one lighter, or else heavier, than the other: if it be true, (as it is, ) that both flesh and spirit are creatures of God; one wrought by His hand, one consummated by His afflatus. Since, then, they equally pertain to the Lord, whichever of them sins equally offends the Lord. Is it for you to distinguish the acts of the flesh and the spirit, whose communion and conjunction in life, in death, and in resurrection, are so intimate, that \"at that time\"[fn-112-P11289_3199829:17-nf] they are equally raised up either for life or else for judgment; because, to wit, they have equally either sinned or lived innocently? This we would (once for all) premise, in order that we may understand that no less necessity for repentance is incumbent on either part of man, if in anything it have sinned, than on both. The guilt of both is common; common, too, is the Judge-God to wit; common, therefore, is withal the healing medicine of repentance. The source whence sins are named \"spiritual\" and \"corporeal\" is the fact that every sin is matter either of act or else of thought: so that what is in deed is \"corporeal,\" because a deed, like a body, is capable of being seen and touched; what is in the mind is \"spiritual,\" because spirit is neither seen nor handled: by which consideration is shown that sins not of deed only, but of will too, are to be shunned, and by repentance purged. For if human finitude[fn-112-P11290_3200838:18-nf] judges only sins of deed, because it is not equal to (piercing) the lurking-places of the will, let us not on that account make light of crimes of the will in God's sight. God is all-sufficient. Nothing from whence any sin whatsoever proceeds is remote from His sight; because He is neither ignorant, nor does He omit to decree it to judgment. He is no dissembler of, nor double-dealer with,[fn-112-P11291_3201248:19-nf] His own clear-sightedness. What (shall we say of the fact) that will is the origin of deed? For if any sins are imputed to chance, or to necessity, or to ignorance, let them see to themselves: if these be excepted, there is no sinning save by will. Since, then, will is the origin of deed, is it not so much the rather amenable to penalty as it is first in guilt? Nor, if some difficulty interferes with its full accomplishment, is it even in that ease exonerated; for it is itself imputed to itself: nor; having done the work which lay in its own power, will it be excusable by reason of that miscarriage of its accomplishment. In fact, how does the Lord demonstrate Himself as adding a superstructure to the Law, except by interdicting sins of the will as well (as other sins); while He defines not only the man who had actually invaded another's wedlock to be an adulterer, but likewise him who had contaminated (a woman) by the concupiscence of his gaze?[fn-112-P11292_3202265:20-nf] Accordingly it is dangerous enough for the mind to set before itself what it is forbidden to perform, and rashly through the will to perfect its execution. And since the power of this will is such that, even without fully sating its self-gratification, it stands for a deed; as a deed, therefore, it shall be punished. It is utterly vain to say, \"I willed, but yet I did not.\" Rather you ought to carry the thing through, because you will; or else not to will, because you do not carry it through. But, by the confession of your consciousness, you pronounce your own condemnation. For if you eagerly desired a good thing, you would have been anxious to carry it through; in like manner, as you do not carry an evil thing through, you ought not to have eagerly desired it. Wherever you take your stand, you are fast bound by guilt; because you have either willed evil, or else have not fulfilled good.","title":"On Repentance.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":22,"verse":44,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_48_dialogue_of_justin","source_chapter":105,"source_paragraph":"542","folder":"ANF-01","text":"\"Then what is next said in the Psalm-`For trouble is near, for there is none to help me. Many calves have compassed me; fat bulls have beset me round. They opened their mouth upon me as a ravening and roaring lion. All my bones are poured out and dispersed like water, '-was likewise a prediction of the events which happened to Him. For on that night when some of your nation, who had been sent by the Pharisees and Scribes, and teachers,[fn-49-P4933_1091378:394-nf] came upon Him from the Mount[fn-49-P4934_1091510:395-nf] of Olives, those whom Scripture called butting and prematurely destructive calves surrounded Him. And the expression, `Fat bulls have beset me round, 'He spoke beforehand of those who acted similarly to the calves, when He was led before your teachers. And the Scripture described them as bulls, since we know that bulls are authors of calves' existence. As therefore the bulls are the begetters of the calves, so your teachers were the cause why their children went out to the Mount of Olives to take Him and bring Him to them. And the expression, `For there is none to help, 'is also indicative of what took place. For there was not even a single man to assist Him as an innocent person. And the expression, `They opened their mouth upon me like a roaring lion, ' designates him who was then king of the Jews, and was called Herod, a successor of the Herod who, when Christ was born, slew all the infants in Bethlehem born about the same time, because he imagined that amongst them He would assuredly be of whom the Magi from Arabia had spoken; for he was ignorant of the will of Him that is stronger than all, how He had commanded Joseph and Mary to take the Child and depart into Egypt, and there to remain until a revelation should again be made to them to return into their own country. And there they did remain until Herod, who slew the infants in Bethlehem, was dead, and Archelaus had succeeded him. And he died before Christ came to the dispensation on the cross which was given Him by His Father. And when Herod succeeded Archelaus, having received the authority which had been allotted to him, Pilate sent to him by way of compliment Jesus bound; and God foreknowing that this would happen, had thus spoken: `And they brought Him to the Assyrian, a present to the king.'[fn-49-P4935_1093489:396-nf] Or He meant the devil by the lion roaring against Him: whom Moses calls the serpent, but in Job and Zechariah he is called the devil, and by Jesus is addressed as Satan, showing that a compounded name was acquired by him from the deeds which he performed. For <sq>sata in the Jewish and Syrian tongue means apostate; and <sq>nas is the word from which he is called by interpretation the serpent, i.e., according to the interpretation of the Hebrew term, from both of which there arises the single word Satanas. For this devil, when [Jesus] went up from the river Jordan, at the time when the voice spake to Him, `Thou art my Son: this day have I begotten Thee, '[fn-49-P4936_1094170:397-nf] is recorded in the memoirs of the apostles to have come to Him and tempted Him, even so far as to say to Him, `Worship me; 'and Christ answered him, `Get thee behind me, Satan: thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.'[fn-49-P4937_1094449:398-nf] For as he had deceived Adam, so he hoped[fn-49-P4938_1094514:399-nf] that he might contrive some mischief against Christ also. Moreover, the statement, `All my bones are poured out[fn-49-P4939_1094652:400-nf] and dispersed like water; my heart has become like wax, melting in the midst of my belly, 'was a prediction of that which happened to Him on that night when men came out against Him to the Mount of Olives to seize Him.

We are told in the Gospel that Judas, one of Christ's friends and associates at table, betrayed Him. Let the show you how this is foretold in the Psalms: \"He who hath eaten My bread hath lifted up his heel against Me:\"[fn-97-P9733_2736731:50-nf] and in another place; \"My friends and My neighbours drew near and set themselves against Me:\"[fn-97-P9734_2736842:51-nf] and again; \"His words were made softer than oil and yet be they very darts.\"[fn-97-P9735_2736938:52-nf] What then is meant by his words were made soft? \"Judas came to Jesus and said unto Him, Hail, Master, and kissed Him.\"[fn-97-P9736_2737074:53-nf] Thus through the soft blandishment of a kiss he implanted the execrable dart of betrayal. On which the Lord said to him, \"Judas, betrayest thou the Son of Man with a kiss?\"[fn-97-P9737_2737268:54-nf] You observe that He was appraised by the traitor's covetousness at thirty pieces of silver. Of this also the Prophet speaks, \"And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price, or if not, forbear;\" and presently, \"I received from them,\" he says, \"thirty pieces of silver, and I cast them into the house of the Lord, into the foundry.\"[fn-97-P9738_2737630:55-nf] Is not this what is written in the Gospels, that Judas, \"repenting of what he had done, brought back the money, and threw it down in the temple and departed?\"[fn-97-P9739_2737827:56-nf] Well did He call it His price, as though blaming and upbraiding. For He had done so many good works among them, He had given sight to the blind, feet to the lame, the power of walking to the palsied, life also to the dead; for all these good works they paid Him death as His price, appraised at thirty pieces of silver. It is related also in the Gospels that He was bound. This also the word of prophecy had foretold by Isaiah, saying, \"Woe unto their soul, who have devised a most evil device against themselves, saying, Let us bind the just One, seeing that He is unprofitable to us.\"[fn-97-P9740_2738451:57-nf] ","title":"A Commentary on the Apostles' Creed.","author":"Rufinus"},{"chapter":22,"verse":69,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_45_a_commentary_on_the_apostles_creed_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"99","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"32.

Lastly the Author of man's salvation teaches us how feeble and weak and insufficient our faith would be unless it were strengthened by the aid of the Lord, when He says to Peter \"Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat. But I have prayed to my Father that thy faith fail not.\"[fn-39-P3923_1454949:69-nf] And another finding that this was happening in his own case, and seeing that his faith was being driven by the waves of unbelief on the rocks which would cause a fearful shipwreck, asks of the same Lord an aid to his faith, saying \"Lord, help mine unbelief.\"[fn-39-P3924_1455235:70-nf] So thoroughly then did those Apostles and men in the gospel realize that everything which is good is brought to perfection by the aid of the Lord, and not imagine that they could preserve their faith unharmed by their own strength or free will that they prayed that it might be helped or granted to them by the Lord. And if in Peter's case there was need of the Lord's help that it might not fail, who will be so presumptuous and blind as to fancy that he has no need of daily assistance from the Lord in order to preserve it? Especially as the Lord Himself has made this clear in the gospel, saying: \"As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine, so no more can ye, except ye abide in me.\"[fn-39-P3925_1455973:71-nf] And again: \"for without me ye can do nothing.\"[fn-39-P3926_1456040:72-nf] How foolish and wicked then it is to attribute any good action to our own diligence and not to God's grace and assistance, is clearly shown by the Lord's saying, which lays down that no one can show forth the fruits of the Spirit without His inspiration and co-operation.

Celsus next throws in an expression in regard to wisdom, as though he thought that, according to the teaching of Christ, no wise man could come to the Father. But we would ask in what sense he speaks of a wise man. For if he means one who is wise in \"the wisdom of this world,\" as it is called, \"which is foolishness with God,\"[fn-109-P10958_2946059:45-nf] then we would agree with him in saying that access to the Father is denied to one who is wise in that sense. But if by wisdom any one means Christ, who is \"the power and wisdom of God,\" far from such a wise man being refused access to the Father, we hold that he who is adorned by the Holy Spirit with that gift which is called \"the word of wisdom,\" far excels all those who have not received the same grace.","title":"Book VII.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":22,"verse":31,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_63_book_iv_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"138","folder":"ANF-02","text":"On martyrdom the Lord hath spoken explicitly, and what is written in different places we bring together. \"But I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess in Me before men, the Son of man also shall confess before the angels of God; but whosoever shall deny Me before men, him will I deny before the angels.\"[fn-68-P6820_2077266:103-nf] \"Whosoever shall be ashamed of Me or of My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him shall the Son of man also be ashamed when He cometh in the glory of His Father with His angels.

For the Holy Spirit shall teach you in the same hour what ye must say.\"[fn-68-P6822_2077821:105-nf] In explanation of this passage, Heracleon, the most distinguished of the school of Valentinians, says expressly, \"that there is a confession by faith and conduct, and one with the voice. The confession that is made with the voice, and before the authorities, is what the most reckon the only confession. Not soundly: and hypocrites also can confess with this confession. But neither will this utterance be found to be spoken universally; for all the saved have confessed with the confession made by the voice, and departed.[fn-68-P6823_2078370:106-nf] Of whom are Matthew, Philip, Thomas, Levi, and many others. And confession by the lip is not universal, but partial. But that which He specifies now is universal, that which is by deeds and actions corresponding to faith in Him. This confession is followed by that which is partial, that before the authorities, if necessary, and reason dictate. For he will confess rightly with his voice who has first confessed by his disposition.[fn-68-P6824_2079084:107-nf] And he has well used, with regard to those who confess, the expression `in Me, 'and applied to those who deny the expression`Me.'For those, though they confess Him with the voice, yet deny Him, not confessing Him in their conduct. But those alone confess `in Him, 'who live in the confession and conduct according to Him, in which He also confesses, who is contained in them and held by them. Wherefore `He never can deny Himself.'And those deny Him who are not in Him. For He said not, `Whosoever shall deny'in Me, but `Me.'For no one who is in Him will ever deny Him. And the expression `before men' applies both to the saved and the heathen similarly by conduct before the one, and by voice before the other. Wherefore they never can deny Him. But those deny Him who are not in Him.\" So far Heracleon. And in other things he seems to be of the same sentiments with us in this section; but he has not adverted to this, that if some have not by conduct and in their life \"confessed Christ before men,\" they are manifested to have believed with the heart; by confessing Him with the mouth at the tribunals, and not denying Him when tortured to the death. And the disposition being confessed, and especially not being changed by death at any time, cuts away all passions which were engendered by corporeal desire. For there is, so to speak, at the close of life a sudden repentance in action, and a true confession toward Christ, in the testimony of the voice. But if the Spirit of the Father testifies in us, how can we be any more hypocrites, who are said to bear testimony with the voice alone? But it will be given to some, if expedient, to make a defence, that by their witness and confession all may be benefited-those in the Church being confirmed, and those of the heathen who have devoted themselves to the search after salvation wondering and being led to the faith; and the rest seized with amazement. So that confession is by all means necessary.[fn-68-P6825_2081323:108-nf] For it is in our power. But to make a defence for our faith is not universally necessary. For that does not depend on us. \"But he that endureth to the end shall be saved.\" For who of those who are wise would not choose to reign in God, and even to serve? So some \"confess that they know God,\" according to the apostle; \"but in works they deny Him, being abominable and disobedient, and to every good work reprobate.\"[fn-68-P6826_2081879:109-nf] And these, though they confess nothing but this, will have done at the end one good work. Their witness, then, appears to be the cleansing away of sins with glory. For instance, the Shepherd[fn-68-P6827_2082089:110-nf] says: \"You will escape the energy of the wild beast, if your heart become pure and blameless.\" Also the Lord Himself says: \"Satan hath desired to sift you; but I have prayed.\"[fn-68-P6828_2082298:111-nf] Alone, therefore, the Lord, for the purification of the men who plotted against Him and disbelieved Him, \"drank the cup; \"in imitation of whom the apostles, that they might be in reality Gnostics, and perfect, suffered for the Churches which they founded. So, then, also the Gnostics who tread in the footsteps of the apostles ought to be sinless, and, out of love to the Lord, to love also their brother; so that, if occasion call, enduring without stumbling, afflictions for the Church, \"they may drink the cup.\" Those who witness in their life by deed, and at the tribunal by word, whether entertaining hope or surmising fear, are better than those who confess salvation by their mouth alone. But if one ascend also to love, he is a really blessed and true martyr, having confessed perfectly both to the commandments and to God, by the Lord; whom having loved, he acknowledged a brother, giving himself up wholly for God, resigning pleasantly and lovingly the man when asked, like a deposit.[fn-68-P6829_2083319:112-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":22,"verse":48,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_53_letter_xli_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"19","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"16.

As if in the sight of God mere words, and not mainly the will was called in fault,and as if only the actual deed of sin, and not also the wish and purpose, was reckoned as wrong; or as if it would be asked in the judgment only what each one had done and not what he also purposed to do. For it is not only the character of the anger roused, but also the purpose of the man who provokes it which is bad, and therefore the true scrutiny of our judge will ask, not how the quarrel was stirred up but by whose fault it arose: for the purpose of the sin, and not the way in which the fault is committed must be taken into account. For what does it matter whether a man kills a brother with a sword by himself, or drives him to death by some fraud, when it is clear that he is killed by his wiles and crime? As if it were enough not to have pushed a blind man down with one's own hand, though he is equally guilty who scorned to save him, when it was in his power, when fallen and on the point of tumbling into the ditch: or as if he alone were guilty who had caught a man with the hand, and not also the one who had prepared and set the trap for him, or who would not set him free when he might have done so. So then it is of no good to hold one's tongue, if we impose silence upon ourselves for this reason that by our silence we may do what would have been done by an outcry on our part, simulating certain gestures by which he whom we ought to have cured, may be made still more angry, while we are commended for all this, to his loss and damage: as if a man were not for this very reason the more guilty, because he tried to get glory for himself out of his brother's fall. For such a silence will be equally bad for both because while it increases the vexation in the heart of another, so it prevents it from being removed from one's own: and against such persons the prophet's curse is with good reason directed: \"Woe to him that giveth drink to his friend, and presenteth his gall, and maketh him drunk, that he may behold his nakedness. He is filled with shame instead of glory.\"[fn-57-P5763_2049866:29-nf] And this too which is said of such people by another: \"For every brother will utterly supplant, and every friend will walk deceitfully. And a man shall mock his brother, and they will not speak the truth, for they have bent their tongue like a bow for lies and not for truth.\"[fn-57-P5764_2050165:30-nf] But often a feigned patience excites to anger more keenly than words, and, a spiteful silence exceeds the most awful insults in words, and the wounds of enemies are more easily borne than the deceitful blandishment of mockers, of which it is well said by the prophet: \"Their words are smoother than oil, and yet they are darts:\" and elsewhere the words of the crafty are soft: but they smite within the belly:\" to which this also may be finely applied: \"With the mouth he speaks peace to his friend, but secretly he layeth snares for him;\"with which however the deceiver is rather deceived, for \"if a man prepares a net before his friend, it surrounds his own feet;\" and: \"if a man digs a pit for his neighbour, he shall fall into it himself.\"[fn-57-P5765_2050929:31-nf] Lastly when a great multitude had come with swords and staves to take the Lord, none of the murderers of the author of our life stood forth as more cruel than he who advanced before them all with a counterfeit respect and salutation and offered a kiss of reigned love; to whom the Lord said: \"Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?\"[fn-57-P5766_2051350:32-nf] i.e., the bitter- ness of thy persecution and hatred has taken as a cloke this which expresses the sweetness of true love. More openly too and more energetically does He emphasize the force of this grief by the prophet, saying: \"For if mine enemy had cursed me, I would have borne it: and if he who hated me had spoken great things against me, I would have hid myself from him.

We have an advocate and an intercessor for our sins, Jesus Christ the Lord and our God, if only we repent of our sins past, and confess and acknowledge our sins, whereby we now offend the Lord, and for the time to come engage to walk in His ways, and to fear His commandments. The Father corrects and protects us, if we still stand fast in the faith both in afflictions and perplexities, that is to say, cling closely to His Christ; as it is written, \"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine or nakedness, or peril, or sword?[fn-48-P4883_1478545:18-nf] None of these things can separate believers, nothing can tear away those who are clinging to His body and blood.

For of that Church of the Gentiles which was to come, the woman that had the issue of blood was a type: she touched and was not seen; she was not known and yet was healed. It was in reality a figure what the Lord asked: \"Who touched me?\" As if not knowing, He healed her as unknown: so has He done also to the Gentiles. We did not get to know Him in the flesh, yet we have been made worthy to eat His flesh, and to be members in His flesh. In what way? Because He sent to us. Whom? His heralds, His disciples, His servants, His redeemed whom He created, but whom He redeemed, His brethren also. I have said but little of all that they are: His own members, Himself; for He sent to us His own members, and He made us His members. Nevertheless, Christ has not been among us with the bodily form which the Jews saw and despised; because this also was said concerning Him, even as the apostle says: \"Now I say that Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers.[fn-14-P1459_917091:20-nf] He owed it to have come to those by whose fathers and to whose fathers He was promised. For this reason He says also Himself: \"I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\"[fn-14-P1460_917298:21-nf] But what says the apostle in the following words? \"And that the Gentiles might glorify God for His mercy.\" What, moreover, saith the Lord Himself? \"Other sheep I have which are not of this fold.[fn-14-P1461_917513:22-nf] He who had said, \"I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel,\" how has He other sheep to which He was not sent, except that He intimated that He was not sent to show His bodily presence but to the Jews only, who saw and killed Him? And yet many of them, both before and afterwards, believed. The first harvest was winnowed from the cross, that there might be a seed whence another harvest might spring up. But at this present time, when roused by the fame of the gospel, and by its goodly odor, His faithful ones among all nations believe, He shall be the expectation of the Gentiles, when He shall come who has already come; when He shall be seen by all, He who was then not seen by some, by some was seen; when He shall come to judge who came to be judged; when He shall come to distinguish who came not to be distinguished. For Christ was not discerned by the ungodly, but was condemned with the ungodly; for it was said concerning Him, \"He was accounted among the wicked.\"[fn-14-P1462_918526:23-nf] The robber escaped, Christ was condemned. He who was loaded with criminal accusations received pardon; He who has released from their crimes all who confess Him, was condemned. Nevertheless even the cross itself, if thou considerest it well, was a judgment-seat; for the Judge being set up in the middle, one thief who believed was delivered, the other who reviled was condemned.[fn-14-P1463_918926:24-nf] Already He signified what He is to do with the quick and the dead: some He will set on His right hand and others on His left. That thief was like those that shall be on the left hand, the other like those that shall be on the right.

For every day in the reckoning of the moon does not end in the evening as the same day in respect of number, as it is at its beginning in the morning. For the day which in the morning, that is up to the sixth hour and half, is numbered the 13th day of the month, is found at even to be the 14th. Wherefore, also, the Passover is enjoined to be extended on to the 21st day at even; which day, without doubt, in the morning, that is, up to that term of hours which we have mentioned, was reckoned the 20th.

These things, which took place before in shadows, were typical But now the Truth is nigh unto us, `the Image of the invisible God[fn-95-P9500_3430846:16-nf] ,' our Lord Jesus Christ, the true Light, Who instead of a staff, is our sceptre, instead of unleavened bread, is the bread which came down from heaven, Who, instead of sandals, hath furnished us with the preparation of the Gospel[fn-95-P9501_3431096:17-nf] , and Who, to speak briefly, by all these hath guided us to His Father. And if enemies afflict us and persecute us, He again, instead of Moses, will encourage us with better words, saying, `Be of good cheer; I have overcome the wicked one[fn-95-P9502_3431373:18-nf] .' And if after we have passed over the Red Sea heat should again vex us or some bitterness of the waters befall us, even thence again the Lord will appear to us, imparting to us of His sweetness, and His life-giving fountain, saying, `If any man thirst, let him come to Me, and drink[fn-95-P9503_3431676:19-nf] .'","title":"Letter XIV.

It was after this bread, then, that Satan entered into the Lord's betrayer, that, as now given over to his power, he might take full possession of one into whom before this he had only entered in order to lead him into error. For we are not to suppose that he was not in him when he went to the Jews and bargained about the price of betraying the Lord; for the evangelist Luke very plainly attests this when he says: \"Then entered Satan into Judas, who was surnamed Iscariot, being one of the twelve; and he went his way, and communed with the chief priests.\"[fn-25-P2547_1507872:4-nf] Here, you see, it is shown that Satan had already entered into Judas. His first entrance, therefore, was when he implanted in his heart the thought of betraying Christ; for in such a spirit had he already come to the supper. But now, after the bread, he entered into him, no longer to tempt one who belonged to another, but to take possession of him as his own.","title":"Tractate LXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_67_tractate_lxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"3.

For the dipping of a thing does not always imply its washing; but some things are dipped in order to be dyed.

Or was it that the Apostle Peter, as some with a perverse kind of favor strive to excuse him,[fn-26-P2616_1539807:1-nf] did not deny Christ, because, when questioned by the maid, he replied that he did not know the man, as the other evangelists more expressly affirm? As if, indeed, he that denies the man Christ does not deny Christ; and so denies Him in respect of what He became on our account, that the nature He had given us might not be lost. Whoever, therefore, acknowledges Christ as God, and disowns Him as man, Christ died not for him; for as man it was that Christ died. He who disowns Christ as man, finds no reconciliation to God by the Mediator. For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.[fn-26-P2617_1540459:2-nf] He that denies Christ as man is not justified: for as by the disobedience of one man, many were made sinners; so also by the obedience of one man shall many be made righteous.[fn-26-P2618_1540652:3-nf] He that denies Christ as man, shall not rise again into the resurrection of life; for by man is death, and by man is also the resurrection of the dead: for as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.[fn-26-P2619_1540886:4-nf] And by what means is He the Head of the Church, but by His manhood, because the Word was made flesh, that is, God, the Only-begotten of God the Father, became man. And how then canone be in the body of Christ who denies the man Christ? Or how can one be a member who disowns the Head? But why linger over a multitude of reasons when the Lord Himself undoes all the windings of human argumentation? For He says not, The cock shall not crow till thou hast denied the man; or, as He was wont to speak in His more familiar condescension with men, The cock shall not crow till thou hast thrice denied the Son of man; but He says, \"till thou hast denied me thrice.\" What is that \"me,\" but just what He was, and what was He but Christ? Whatever of Him, therefore, he denied, he denied Himself, he denied the Christ, he denied the Lord his God. For Thomas also, his fellow-disciple, when he exclaimed, \"My Lord and my God,\" did not handle the Word, but only His flesh; and laid not his inquisitive hands on the incorporeal nature of God, but on His human body.[fn-26-P2620_1541961:5-nf] And so he touched the man, and yet recognized his God. If, then, what the latter touched, Peter denied; what the latter invoked, Peter offended. \"The cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice.\" Although thou say, \"I know not the man;\" although thou say, \"Man, I know not what thou sayest;\" although thou say, \"I am not one of His disciples;\"[fn-26-P2621_1542334:6-nf] thou wilt be denying me. If, which it were sinful to doubt, Christ so spake, and foretold the truth, then doubtless Peter denied Christ. Let us not accuse Christ in defending Peter. Let infirmity acknowledge its sin; for there is no falsehood in the Truth. When Peter's infirmity acknowledged its sin, his acknowledgment was full; and the greatness of the evil he had committed in denying Christ, he showed by his tears. He himself reproves his defenders, and for their conviction, brings his tears forward as witnesses. Nor have we, on our part, in so speaking, any delight in accusing the first of the apostles; but in looking on him, we ought to take home the lesson to ourselves, that no man should place his confidence in human strength. For what else had our Teacher and Saviour in view, but to show us, by making the first of the apostles himself an example, that no one ought in any way to presume of himself? And that, therefore, really took place in Peter's soul, for which he gave cause in his body. And yet he did not go before in the Lord's behalf, as he rashly presumed, but did so otherwise than he reckoned. For before the death and resurrection of the Lord, he both died when he denied, and returned to life when he wept; but he died, because he himself had been proud in his presumption, and he lived again, because that Other had looked on him with kindness.

What rashness is it, then, for the unskilful to assume pastoral authority, since the government of souls is the art of arts! For who can be ignorant that the sores of the thoughts of men are more occult than the sores of the bowels? And yet how often do men who have no knowledge whatever of spiritual precepts fearlessly profess themselves physicians of the heart, though those who are ignorant of the effect of drugs blush to appear as physicians of the flesh! But because, through the ordering of God, all the highest in rank of this present age are inclined to reverence religion, there are some who, through the outward show of rule within the holy Church, affect the glory of distinction. They desire to appear as teachers, they covet superiority to others, and, as the Truth attests, they seek the first salutations in the market-place, the first rooms at feasts, the first seats in assemblies (Matth. xxiii. 6, 7), being all the less able to administer worthily the office they have undertaken of pastoral care, as they have reached the magisterial position of humility out of elation only. For, indeed, in a magisterial position language itself is confounded when one thing is learnt and another taught[fn-42-P4284_1096234:1-nf] . Against such the Lord complains by the prophet, saying, They have reigned, and not by Me ; they have been set up as prices, and I knew it not (Hos. viii. 4). For those reign of themselves, and not by the Will of the Supreme Ruler, who, supported by no virtues, and in no way divinely called, but inflamed by their own desire, seize rather than attain supreme rule. But them the Judge within both advances, and yet knows not; for whom by permission he tolerates them surely by the judgment of reprobation he ignores. Whence to some who come to Him even after miracles He says, Depart from Me, ye workers of iniquity, I know you not who ye are (Luke xiii. 27). The unskilfulness of shepherds is rebuked by the voice of the Truth, when it is said through the prophet, The shepherds themselves have not known understanding (Isai. lvi. 11); whom again the Lord denounces, saying, And they that handle the law knew Me not (Jer. ii. 8). And therefore the Truth complains of not being known of them, and protests that He knows not the principality of those who know not Him; because in truth these who know not the things of the Lord are unknown of the Lord; as Paul attests, who says, But if any man knoweth not, he shall not be known (1 Cor. xiv. 38). Yet this unskilfulness of the shepherds doubtless suits often the deserts of those who are subject to them, because, though it is their own fault that they have not the light of knowledge, yet it is in the dealing of strict judgment that through their ignorance those also who follow them should stumble. Hence it is that, in the Gospel, the Truth in person says, If the blind lead the blind, both fall into the ditch (Matth. xv. 14). Hence the Psalmist (not expressing his own desire, but in his ministry as a prophet) denounces such, when he says, Let their eyes be blinded that they see not, and ever bow thou down their back (Ps. lxviii. 24[fn-42-P4285_1098661:2-nf] ). For, indeed, those persons are eyes who, placed in the very face of the highest dignity, have undertaken the office of spying out the road; while those who are attached to them and follow them are denominated backs. And so, when the eyes are blinded, the back is bent, because, when those who go before lose the light of knowledge, those who follow are bowed down to carry the burden of their sins.","title":"Part I.","author":"Gregory the Great"},{"chapter":22,"verse":27,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_68_letter_l","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"Whom, indeed, could it better befit to encourage the timid, and rouse the slumbering, than you, my godly lord, who have shewn your general excellence in this, too, that you have consented to come down among us, your lowly inferiors, like a true disciple of Him Who said, \"I am among you,\" not as a fellow guest, but \"as he that serveth.\"[fn-33-P3349_1094230:3-nf] For you have condescended to minister to us your spiritual gladness, to refresh our souls by your honoured letter, and, as it were, to fling the arms of your greatness round the infancy of children.
