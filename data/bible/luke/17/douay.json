{"verses":["And he said to his disciples:  It is impossible that scandals\nshould not come.  But woe to him through whom they come!","It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his\nneck and he cast into the sea, than that he should scandalize one of\nthese little ones.","Take heed to yourselves.

And it would obey you.","But which of you, having a servant ploughing or feeding cattle,\nwill say to him, when he is come from the field:  Immediately go.  Sit\ndown to meat.","And will not rather say to him:  Make ready my supper and gird\nthyself and serve me, whilst I eat and drink; and afterwards thou shalt\neat and drink?","Doth he thank that servant for doing the things which he\ncommanded him?","I think not.  So you also, when you shall have done all these\nthings that are commanded you, say:  We are unprofitable servants; we\nhave done that which we ought to do.","And it came to pass, as he was going to Jerusalem, he passed\nthrough the midst of Samaria and Galilee.","And as he entered into a certain town, there met him ten men\nthat were lepers, who stood afar off.","And lifted up their voice, saying:  Jesus, Master, have mercy on\nus.","Whom when he saw, he said:  Go, shew yourselves to the priests.\nAnd it came to pass, as they went, they were made clean.","And one of them, when he saw that he was made clean, went back,\nwith a loud voice glorifying God.","And he fell on his face before his feet, giving thanks.  And this\nwas a Samaritan.","And Jesus answering, said:  Were not ten made clean?  And where\nare the nine?","There is no one found to return and give glory to God, but this\nstranger.","And he said to him:  Arise, go thy way; for thy faith hath made\nthee whole.","And being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should\ncome, he answering them and said:  The kingdom of God cometh not with\nobservation.","Neither shall they say:  Behold here, or behold there.
