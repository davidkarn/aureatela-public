Driven from this line of defence you will appeal to the example of the clergy. These, you will say, remain in their cities, and yet they are surely above criticism. Far be it from me to censure the successors of the apostles, who with holy words consecrate the body of Christ, and who make us Christians.[fn-4-P425_78672:217-nf] Having the keys of the kingdom of heaven, they judge men to some extent before the day of judgment, and guard the chastity of the bride of Christ. But, as I have before hinted, the case of monks is different from that of the clergy. The clergy feed Christ's sheep; I as a monk am fed by them. They live of the altar:[fn-4-P426_79025:218-nf] I, if I bring no gift to it, have the axe laid to my root as to that of a barren tree.[fn-4-P427_79149:219-nf] Nor can I plead poverty as an excuse, for the Lord in the gospel has praised an aged widow for casting into the treasury the last two coins that she had.[fn-4-P428_79325:220-nf] I may not sit in the presence of a presbyter;[fn-4-P429_79393:221-nf] he, if I sin, may deliver me to Satan, \"for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved.\"[fn-4-P430_79523:222-nf] Under the old law he who disobeyed the priests was put outside the camp and stoned by the people, or else he was beheaded and expiated his contempt with his blood.[fn-4-P431_79707:223-nf] But now the disobedient person is cut down with the spiritual sword, or he is expelled from the church and torn to pieces by ravening demons. Should the entreaties of your brethren induce you to take orders, I shall rejoice that you are lifted up, and fear lest you may be cast down. You will say: \"If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.\"[fn-4-P432_80110:224-nf] I know that; but you should add what follows: such an one \"must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, chaste, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach, not given to wine, no striker but patient.\"[fn-4-P433_80358:225-nf] After fully explaining the qualifications of a bishop the apostle speaks of ministers of the third degree with equal care. \"Likewise must the deacons be grave,\" he writes, \"not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre, holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. And let these also first be proved; then, let them minister, being found blameless.\"[fn-4-P434_80780:226-nf] Woe to the man who goes in to the supper without a wedding garment. Nothing remains for him but the stern question, \"Friend, how camest thou in hither?\" And when he is speechless the order will be given, \"Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\"[fn-4-P435_81135:227-nf] Woe to him who, when he has received a talent, has bound it in a napkin; and, whilst others make profits, only preserves what he has received. His angry lord shall rebuke him in a moment. \"Thou wicked servant,\" he will say, \"wherefore gavest thou not my money into the bank that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?\"[fn-4-P436_81497:228-nf] That is to say, you should have laid before the altar what you were not able to bear. For whilst you, a slothful trader, keep a penny in your hands, you occupy the place of another who might double the money. Wherefore, as he who ministers well purchases to himself a good degree,[fn-4-P437_81799:229-nf] so he who approaches the cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.[fn-4-P438_81925:230-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":21,"verse":34,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"664","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"9. In saying this, I do not of course condemn food which God created to be enjoyed with thanksgiving,[fn-22-P2212_544483:1570-nf] but I seek to remove from youths and girls what are incentives to sensual pleasure. Neither the fiery Etna nor the country of Vulcan,[fn-22-P2213_544640:1571-nf] nor Vesuvius, nor Olympus, burns with such violent heat as the youthful marrow of those who are flushed with wine and filled with food. Many trample covetousness under foot, and lay it down as readily as they lay down their purse. An enforced silence serves to make amends for a railing tongue. The outward appearance and the mode of dress can be changed in a single hour. All other sins are external, and what is external can easily be cast away. Desire alone, implanted in men by God to lead them to procreate children, is internal; and this, if it once oversteps its own bounds, becomes a sin, and by a law of nature cries out for sexual intercourse. It is therefore a work of great merit, and one which requires unremitting diligence to overcome that which is innate in you; while living in the flesh not to live after the flesh; to strive with yourself day by day and to watch the foe shut up within you with the hundred eyes of the fabled Argus.[fn-22-P2214_545641:1572-nf] This is what the apostle says in other words: \"Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.\"[fn-22-P2215_545887:1573-nf] Physicians and others who have written on the nature of the human body, and particularly Galen in his books entitled On matters of health, say that the bodies of boys and of young men and of full grown men and women glow with an interior heat and consequently that for persons of these ages all food is injurious which tends to promote this heat: while on the other hand it is highly conducive to health in eating and in drinking to take things cold and cooling. Contrariwise they tell us that warm food and old wine are good for the old who suffer from humours and from chilliness. Hence it is that the Saviour says \"Take heed to yourselves lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and cares of this life.\"[fn-22-P2216_546655:1574-nf] So too speaks the apostle: \"Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess.\"[fn-22-P2217_546750:1575-nf] No wonder that the potter spoke thus of the vessel which He had made when even the comic poet whose only object is to know and to describe the ways of men tells us that","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":21,"verse":33,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"711","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"3. In speaking thus I am not laying myself open to a charge of inconsistency or condemning the course which I have myself taken. It is not, I believe, for nothing that I, like Abraham, have left my home and people. But I do not presume to limit God's omnipotence or to restrict to a narrow strip of earth Him whom the heaven cannot contain. Each believer is judged not by his residence in this place or in that but according to the deserts of his faith. The true worshippers worship the Father neither at Jerusalem nor on mount Gerizim; for \"God is a spirit, and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth.\"[fn-24-P2444_625254:1751-nf] \"Now the spirit bloweth where it listeth,\"[fn-24-P2445_625319:1752-nf] and \"the earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof.\"[fn-24-P2446_625406:1753-nf] When the fleece of Judaea was made dry although the whole world was wet with the dew of heaven,[fn-24-P2447_625524:1754-nf] and when many came from the East and from the West[fn-24-P2448_625601:1755-nf] and sat in Abraham's bosom:[fn-24-P2449_625653:1756-nf] then God ceased to be known in Judah only and His name to be great in Israel alone;[fn-24-P2450_625760:1757-nf] the sound of the apostles went out into all the earth and their words into the ends of the world.[fn-24-P2451_625881:1758-nf] The Saviour Himself speaking to His disciples in the temple[fn-24-P2452_625962:1759-nf] said: \"arise, let us go hence,\"[fn-24-P2453_626111:1760-nf] and to the Jews: \"your house is left unto you desolate.\"[fn-24-P2454_626191:1761-nf] If heaven and earth must pass away,[fn-24-P2455_626253:1762-nf] obviously all things that are earthly must pass away also. Therefore the spots which witnessed the crucifixion and the resurrection profit those only who bear their several crosses, who day by day rise again with Christ, and who thus shew themselves worthy of an abode so holy. Those who say \"the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord,\"[fn-24-P2456_626618:1763-nf] should give ear to the words of the apostle: \"ye are the temple of the Lord,\"[fn-24-P2457_626718:1764-nf] and the Holy Ghost \"dwelleth in you.\"[fn-24-P2458_626780:1765-nf] Access to the courts of heaven is as easy from Britain as it is from Jerusalem; for \"the kingdom of God is within you.\"[fn-24-P2459_626924:1766-nf] Antony and the hosts of monks who are in Egypt, Mesopotamia, Pontus, Cappadocia, and Armenia, have never seen Jerusalem: and the door of Paradise is opened for them at a distance from it. The blessed Hilarion, though a native of and a dweller in Palestine, only set eyes on Jerusalem for a single day, not wishing on the one hand when he was so near to neglect the holy places, nor yet on the other to appear to confine God within local limits. From the time of Hadrian to the reign of Constantine-a period of about one hundred and eighty years[fn-24-P2460_627493:1767-nf] -the spot which had witnessed the resurrection was occupied by a figure of Jupiter; while on the rock where the cross had stood, a marble statue of Venus was set up by the heathen and became an object of worship. The original persecutors, indeed, supposed that by polluting our holy places they would deprive us of our faith in the passion and in the resurrection. Even my own Bethlehem, as it now is, that most venerable spot in the whole world of which the psalmist sings: \"the truth hath sprung out of the earth,\"[fn-24-P2461_628084:1768-nf] was overshadowed by a grove of Tammuz,[fn-24-P2462_628153:1769-nf] that is of Adonis; and in the very cave[fn-24-P2463_628218:1770-nf] where the infant Christ had uttered His earliest cry lamentation was made for the paramour of Venus.[fn-24-P2464_628437:1771-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":21,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1111","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"18. Envy always follows in the track of virtue: as Horace says, it is ever the mountain top that is smitten by the lightning.[fn-40-P4034_1086476:2891-nf] It is not surprising that I declare this of men and women, when the jealousy of the Pharisees succeeded in crucifying our Lord Himself. All the saints have had illwishers, and even Paradise was not free from the serpent through whose malice death came into the world.[fn-40-P4035_1086835:2892-nf] So the Lord stirred up against Paula Hadad the Edomite[fn-40-P4036_1086914:2893-nf] to buffet her that she might not be exalted, and warned her frequently by the thorn in her flesh[fn-40-P4037_1087057:2894-nf] not to be elated by the greatness of her own virtues or to fancy that, compared with other women, she had attained the summit of perfection. For my part I used to say that it was best to give in to rancour and to retire before passion. So Jacob dealt with his brother Esau; so David met the unrelenting persecution of Saul. I reminded her how the first of these fled into Mesopotamia;[fn-40-P4038_1087467:2895-nf] and how the second surrendered himself to the Philistines,[fn-40-P4039_1087548:2896-nf] and chose to submit to foreign foes rather than to enemies at home. She however replied as follows:- 'Your suggestion would be a wise one if the devil did not everywhere fight against God's servants and handmaidens, and did he not always precede the fugitives to their chosen refuges. Moreover, I am deterred from accepting it by my love for the holy places; and I cannot find another Bethlehem elsewhere. Why may I not by my patience conquer this ill will? Why may I not by my humility break down this pride, and when I am smitten on the one cheek offer to the smiter the other?[fn-40-P4040_1088151:2897-nf] Surely the apostle Paul says \"Overcome evil with good.\"[fn-40-P4041_1088242:2898-nf] Did not the apostles glory when they suffered reproach for the Lord's sake? Did not even the Saviour humble Himself, taking the form of a servant and being made obedient to the Father unto death, even the death of the cross,[fn-40-P4042_1088492:2899-nf] that He might save us by His passion? If Job had not fought the battle and won the victory, he would never have received the crown of righteousness, or have heard the Lord say: \"Thinkest thou that I have spoken unto thee for aught else than this, that thou mightest appear righteous.\"[fn-40-P4043_1088799:2900-nf] In the gospel those only are said to be blessed who suffer persecution for righteousness' sake.[fn-40-P4044_1088962:2901-nf] My conscience is at rest, and I know that it is not from any fault of mine that I am suffering; moreover affliction in this world is a ground for expecting a reward hereafter.' When the enemy was more than usually forward and ventured to reproach her to her face, she used to chant the words of the psalter: \"While the wicked was before me, I was dumb with silence; I held my peace even from good:\"[fn-40-P4045_1089387:2902-nf] and again, \"I as a deaf man heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth:\"[fn-40-P4046_1089505:2903-nf] and \"I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.\"[fn-40-P4047_1089604:2904-nf] When she felt herself tempted, she dwelt upon the words in Deuteronomy: \"The Lord your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul.\"[fn-40-P4048_1089828:2905-nf] In tribulations and afflictions she turned to the splendid language of Isaiah: \"Ye that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts, look for tribulation upon tribulation, for hope also upon hope: yet a little while must these things be by reason of the malice of the lips and by reason of a spiteful tongue.\" This passage of scripture she explained for her own consolation as meaning that the weaned, that is, those who have come to full age, must endure tribulation upon tribulation that they may be accounted worthy to receive hope upon hope. She recalled to mind also the words of the apostle, \"we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope: and hope maketh not ashamed\"[fn-40-P4049_1090606:2906-nf] and \"though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day\":[fn-40-P4050_1090709:2907-nf] and \"our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh in us[fn-40-P4051_1090790:2908-nf] an eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal.[fn-40-P4052_1091033:2909-nf] She used to say that, although to human impatience the time might seem slow in coming, yet that it would not be long but that presently help would come from God who says: \"In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee.\"[fn-40-P4053_1091316:2910-nf] We ought not, she declared, to dread the deceitful lips and tongues of the wicked, for we rejoice in the aid of the Lord who warns us by His prophet: \"fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings; for the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool\":[fn-40-P4054_1091661:2911-nf] and she quoted His own words, \"In your patience ye shall win your souls\":[fn-40-P4055_1091763:2912-nf] as well as those of the apostle, \"the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed? us\":[fn-40-P4056_1091932:2913-nf] and in another place, \"we are to suffer affliction\"[fn-40-P4057_1092012:2914-nf] that we may be patient in all things that befall us, for \"he that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.\"[fn-40-P4058_1092194:2915-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":21,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1534","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"For the present I will content myself by suggesting to your discretion that you should bear in mind the apostle's words: \"Art thou bound unto a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife;\"[fn-55-P5518_1539559:3915-nf] that is, seek not that binding which is contrary to loosing. He who has contracted the obligations of marriage, is bound, and he who is bound is a slave; on the other hand he who is loosed is free. Since therefore you rejoice in the freedom of Christ, since your life is better than your profession, since you are all but on the housetop of which the Saviour speaks; you ought not to come down to take your clothes,[fn-55-P5519_1540000:3916-nf] you ought not to look behind you, you ought not having put your hand to the plough, then to let it go.[fn-55-P5520_1540144:3917-nf] Rather, if you can, imitate Joseph and leave your garment in the hand of your Egyptian mistress,[fn-55-P5521_1540263:3918-nf] that naked you may follow your Lord and Saviour. For in the gospel He says: \"Whosoever doth not leave all that he hath and bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.\"[fn-55-P5522_1540468:3919-nf] Cast from you the burthen of the things of this world, and seek not those riches which in the gospel are compared to the humps[fn-55-P5523_1540633:3920-nf] of camels. Naked and unencumbered fly up to heaven; masses of gold will but impede the wings of your virtue. I do not speak thus because I know you to be covetous, but because I have a notion that your object in remaining so long in the army is to fill that purse which the Lord has commanded you to empty. For they who have possessions and riches are bidden to sell all that they have and to give to the poor and then to follow the Saviour.[fn-55-P5524_1541124:3921-nf] Thus if your worship is rich already you ought to fulfil the command and sell your riches; or if you are still poor you ought not to amass what you will have to pay away. Christ accepts the sacrifices made for him[fn-55-P5525_1541362:3922-nf] according as he who makes them has a willing mind. Never were any men poorer than the apostles; yet never any left more for the Lord than they. The poor widow in the gospel who cast but two mites into the treasury was set before all the men of wealth because she gave all that she had.[fn-55-P5526_1541674:3923-nf] So it should be with you. Seek not for wealth which you will have to pay away; but rather give up that which you have already acquired that Christ may know his new recruit to be brave and resolute, and then when you are a great way off His Father will run with joy to meet you. He will give you a robe, will put a ring upon your finger. and will kill for you the fatted calf.[fn-55-P5527_1542074:3924-nf] Then when you are freed from all encumbrances God will soon make a way for you to cross the sea to me with your revereZnd brother Quintilian.

Therefore on this double death of ours our Saviour bestowed His own single death; and to cause both our resurrections, He appointed beforehand and set forth in mystery and type His own one resurrection. For He was not a sinner or ungodly, that, as though dead in spirit, He should need to be renewed in the inner man, and to be recalled as it were to the life of righteousness by repentance; but being clothed in mortal flesh, and in that alone dying, in that alone rising again, in that alone did He answer to both for us; since in it was wrought a mystery as regards the inner man, and a type as regards the outer. For it was in a mystery as regards our inner man, so as to signify the death of our soul, that those words were uttered, not only in the Psalm, but also on the cross: \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\"[fn-8-P841_325461:25-nf] To which words the apostle agrees, saying, \"Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin;\" since by the crucifixion of the tuner man are understood the pains of repentance, and a certain wholesome agony of self-control, by which death the death of ungodliness is destroyed, and in which death God has left us. And so the body of sin is destroyed through such a cross, that now we should not yield our members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin.[fn-8-P842_326043:26-nf] Because, if even the inner man certainly is renewed day by day,[fn-8-P843_326128:27-nf] yet undoubtedly it is old before it is renewed. For that is done inwardly of which the same apostle speaks: \"Put off the old man, and put on the new;\" which he goes on to explain by saying, \"Wherefore, putting away lying, speak every man truth.\"[fn-8-P844_326394:28-nf] But where is lying put away, unless inwardly, that he who speaketh the truth from his heart may inhabit the holy hill of God?[fn-8-P845_326541:29-nf] But the resurrection of the body of the Lord is shown to belong to the mystery of our own inner resurrection, where, after He had risen, He says to the woman, \"Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father;\"[fn-8-P846_326775:30-nf] with which mystery the apostle's words agree, where he says, \"If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God; set your thoughts[fn-8-P847_326988:31-nf] on things above.\"[fn-8-P848_327019:32-nf] For not to touch Christ, unless when He had ascended to the Father, means not to have thoughts[fn-8-P849_327135:33-nf] of Christ after a fleshly manner. Again, the death of the flesh of our Lord contains a type of the death of our outer man, since it is by such suffering most of all that He exhorts His servants that they should not fear those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul.[fn-8-P850_327429:34-nf] Wherefore the apostle says, \"That I may fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh.\"[fn-8-P851_327559:35-nf] And the resurrection of the body of the Lord is found to contain a type of the resurrection of our outward man, because He says to His disciples, \"Handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.\"[fn-8-P852_327802:36-nf] And one of the disciples also, handling His scars, exclaimed, \"My Lord and my God!\"[fn-8-P853_327907:37-nf] And whereas the entire integrity of that flesh was apparent, this was shown in that which He had said when exhorting His disciples: \"There shall not a hair of your head perish.\"[fn-8-P854_328104:38-nf] For how comes it that first is said, \"Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father;\"[fn-8-P855_328216:39-nf] and how comes it that before He ascends to the Father, He actually is touched by the disciples: unless because in the former the mystery of the inner man was intimated, in the latter a type was given of the outer man? Or can any one possibly be so without understanding, and so turned away from the truth, as to dare to saythat He was touched by men before He ascended, but by women when He had ascended? It was on account of this type, which went before in the Lord, of our future resurrection in the body, that the apostle says, \"Christ the first-fruits; afterward they that are Christ's.\"[fn-8-P856_328826:40-nf] For it was the resurrection of the body to which this place refers, on account of which he also says, \"Who has changed our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body.\"[fn-8-P857_329035:41-nf] The one death therefore of our Saviour brought salvation to our double death, and His one resurrection wrought for us two resurrections; since His body in both cases, that is, both in His death and in His resurrection, wasministered to us by a kind of healing suitableness, both as a mystery of the inner man, and as a type of the outer.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":21,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_06_book_i_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"63","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"Some one accordingly asked them whether the Word of God could be changed, as the devil has been? and they feared not to say, `Yes, he could; for being begotten, he is susceptible of change' We then, with the bishops of Egypt and Libya, being assembled together to the number of nearly a hundred, have anathematized Arius for his shameless avowal of these heresies, together with all such as have countenanced them. Yet the partisans of Eusebius have received them; endeavoring to blend falsehood with truth, and that which is impious with what is sacred. But they shall not prevail, for the truth must triumph; and `light has no fellowship with darkness, nor has Christ any concord with Belial.'[fn-2-P217_57819:16-nf] Who ever heard such blasphemies? or what man of any piety is there now hearing them that is not horror-struck, and stops his ears, lest the filth of these expressions should pollute his sense of hearing? Who that hears John saying, `In the beginning was the Word,'[fn-2-P218_58104:17-nf] does not condemn those that say, `There was a period when the Word was not'? or who, hearing in the Gospel of `the only-begotten Son,' and that `all things were made by him,' will not abhor those that pronounce the Son to be one of the things made? How can he be one of the things which were made by himself? Or how can he be the only-begotten, if he is reckoned among created things? And how could he have had his existence from nonentities, since the Father has said, `My heart has indited a good matter';[fn-2-P219_58643:18-nf] and `I begat thee out of my bosom before the dawn'?[fn-2-P220_58735:19-nf] Or how is he unlike the Father's essence, who is `his perfect image,'[fn-2-P221_58901:20-nf] and `the brightness of his glory'[fn-2-P222_58952:21-nf] and says: `He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father'? Again how if the Son is the Word and Wisdom of God, was there a period when he did not exist? for that is equivalent to their saying that God was once destitute both of Word and Wisdom. How can he be mutable and susceptible of change, who says of himself, `I am in the Father, and the Father in me';[fn-2-P223_59324:22-nf] and `I and the Father are one';[fn-2-P224_59375:23-nf] and again by the Prophet,[fn-2-P225_59418:24-nf] `Behold me because I am, and have not changed'? But if any one may also apply the expression to the Father himself, yet would it now be even more fifty said of the Word; because he was not changed by having become man, but as the Apostle says,[fn-2-P226_59680:25-nf] `Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, to-day, and forever' But what could persuade them to say that he was made on our account, when Paul has expressly declared[fn-2-P227_59857:26-nf] that `all things are for him, and by him'? One need not wonder indeed at their blasphemous assertion that the Son does not perfectly know the Father; for having once determined to fight against Christ, they reject even the words of the Lord himself, when he says,[fn-2-P228_60139:27-nf] `As the Father knows me, even so know I the Father' If therefore the Father but partially knows the Son, it is manifest that the Son also knows the Father but in part. But if it would be improper to affirm this, and it be admitted that the Father perfectly knows the Son, it is evident that as the Father knows his own Word, so also does the Word know his own Father, whose Word he is. And we, by stating these things, and unfolding the divine Scriptures, have often confuted them: but again as chameleons they were changed, striving to apply to themselves that which is written, `When the ungodly has reached the depths of iniquity, he becomes contemptuous.'[fn-2-P229_60817:28-nf] Many heresies have arisen before these, which exceeding all bounds in daring, have lapsed into complete infatuation: but these persons, by attempting in all their discourses to subvert the Divinity of The Word, as hating made a nearer approach to Antichrist, have comparatively lessened the odium of former ones. Wherefore they have been publicly repudiated by the Church, and anathematized. We are indeed grieved on account of the perdition of these persons, and especially so because, after having been previously instructed in the doctrines of the Church, they have now apostatized from them. Nevertheless we are not greatly surprised at this, for Hymenaeus and Philetus[fn-2-P230_61534:29-nf] fell in like manner; and before them Judas, who had been a follower of the Saviour, but afterwards deserted him became his betrayer. Nor were we without forewarning respecting these very persons: for the Lord himself said: `Take heed that no man deceive you: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ: and shall many deceive many';[fn-2-P231_61911:30-nf] and `the time is at hand; Go ye not therefore after them.'[fn-2-P232_61990:31-nf] And Paul, having learned these things from the Saviour, wrote, `That in the latter times some should apostatize from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits, and doctrines of devils,'[fn-2-P233_62196:32-nf] who pervert the truth. Seeing then that our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ has himself enjoined this, and has also by the apostle given us intimation respecting such men, we having ourselves heard their impiety have in consequence anathematized them, as we before said, and declared them to be alienated from the Catholic Church and faith. Moreover we have intimated this to your piety, beloved and most honored fellow-ministers, in order the ye might neither receive any of them, if they should presume to come to you, nor be induced to put confidence in Eusebius, or any other who may write to you about them. For it is incumbent on us who are Christians, to turn away from all those who speak or entertain a thought against Christ, as from those who are resisting God, and are destroyers of the souls of men: neither does it become us even `to saute such men,'[fn-2-P234_63088:33-nf] as the blessed John has prohibited, `lest we should at any time be made partakers of their sins.'

Our Lord himself says,[fn-66-P6613_2070547:23-nf] \"Simon, Simon, behold Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat. But I made supplication for thee, that thy faith fail not.\" And in the same place, \"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.\" If you reply that this was said before the Passion, we certainly say after the Passion, in the Lord's prayer,[fn-66-P6614_2070948:24-nf] \"Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.\" If we do not sin after baptism, why do we ask that we may be forgiven our sins, which were already forgiven in baptism? Why do we pray that we may not enter into temptation, and that we may be delivered from the evil one, if the devil cannot tempt those who are baptized? The case is different if this prayer belongs to the Catechumens, and is not adapted to faithful Christians. Paul, the chosen vessel,[fn-66-P6615_2071498:25-nf] chastised his body, and brought it into subjection, lest after preaching to others he himself should be found a reprobate, and[fn-66-P6616_2071645:26-nf] he tells that there was given to him \"a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet\" him. And to the Corinthians he writes:[fn-66-P6617_2071797:27-nf] \"I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is toward Christ.\" And elsewhere:[fn-66-P6618_2071981:28-nf] \"But to whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also: for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes have I forgiven it in the person of Christ: that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices.\" And again:[fn-66-P6619_2072287:29-nf] \"There hath no temptation taken you, but such as man can bear; but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make also the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it.\" And,[fn-66-P6620_2072550:30-nf] \"Let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.\" And to the Galatians:[fn-66-P6621_2072652:31-nf] \"Ye were running well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?\" And elsewhere:[fn-66-P6622_2072761:32-nf] \"We would fain have come unto you, I Paul once and again; and Satan hindered us.\" And to the married he says:[fn-66-P6623_2072893:33-nf] \"Be together again, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency.\" And again:[fn-66-P6624_2073000:34-nf] \"But I say, walk by the Spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other: that ye may not do the things that ye would.\" We are a compound of the two, and must endure the strife of the two substances. And to the Ephesians:[fn-66-P6625_2073376:35-nf] \"Our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.\" Does any one think that we are safe, and that it is right to fall asleep when once we have been baptized? And so, too, in the epistle to the Hebrews:[fn-66-P6626_2073753:36-nf] \"For as touching those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come, and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.\" Surely we cannot deny that they have been baptized who have been illuminated, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God. Butif the baptized cannot sin, how is it now that the Apostle says, \"And have fallen away\"?[fn-66-P6627_2074420:37-nf] Montanus and[fn-66-P6628_2075404:38-nf] Novatus would smile at this, for they contend that it is impossible to renew again through repentance those who have crucified to themselves the Son of God, and put Him to an open shame. He therefore corrects this mistake by saying:[fn-66-P6629_2076011:39-nf] \"But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak; for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and the love which ye shewed towards his name, in that ye ministered unto the Saints, and still do minister.\" And truly the unrighteousness of God would be great, if He merely punished sin, and did not welcome good works. I have so spoken, says the Apostle, to withdraw you from your sins, and to make you more careful through fear of despair. But, beloved, I am persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation. For it is not accordant with the righteousness of God to forget good works, and the fact that you have ministered and do minister to the Saints for His name's sake, and to remember sins only. The Apostle James also, knowing that the baptized can be tempted, and fall of their own free choice, says:[fn-66-P6630_2076919:40-nf] \"Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he hath been approved, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to them that love him.\" And that we may not think that we are tempted by God, as we read in Genesis Abraham was, he adds: \"Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, and He Himself tempteth no man. But each man is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lust and enticed. Then the lust, when it hath conceived, beareth sin: and the sin, when it is full grown, bringeth forth death.\" God created us with free will, and we are not forced by necessity either to virtue or to vice. Otherwise, if there be necessity, there is no crown. As n good works it is God who brings them to perfection, for it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that pitieth and gives us help that we may be able to reach the goal: so in things wicked and sinful, the seeds within us give the impulse, and these are brought to maturity by the devil. When he sees that we are building upon the foundation of Christ, hay, wood, stubble, then he applies the match. Let us then build gold, silver, costly stones, and he will not venture to tempt us: although even thus there is not sure and safe possession. For the lion lurks in ambush to slay the innocent.[fn-66-P6631_2078282:41-nf] \"Potters' vessels are proved by the furnace, and just men by the trial of tribulation.\" And in another place it is written:[fn-66-P6632_2078429:42-nf] \"My son, when thou comest to serve the Lord, prepare thyself for temptation.\" Again, the same James says:[fn-66-P6633_2078555:43-nf] \"Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only. For if any one is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror: for he beholdeth himself, and goeth away, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.\" It was useless to warn them to add works to faith, if they could not sin after baptism. He tells us that[fn-66-P6634_2078944:44-nf] \"whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is become guilty of all.\" Which of us is without sin?[fn-66-P6635_2079087:45-nf] \"God hath shut up all unto disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.\" Peter also says:[fn-66-P6636_2079199:46-nf] \"The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation.\" And concerning false teachers:[fn-66-P6637_2079310:47-nf] \"These are springs without water, and mists driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved. For, uttering proud wordsof vanity, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by lasciviousness, those who had just escaped, and have turned back to error.\" Does not the Apostle in these words seem to you to have depicted the new party of ignorance? For, as it were, they open the fountains of knowledge and yet have no water: they promise a shower of doctrine like prophetic clouds which have been visited by the truth of God, and are driven by the storms of devils and vices. They speak great things, and their talk is nothing but pride:[fn-66-P6638_2080000:48-nf] \"But every one is unclean with God who is lifted up in his own heart.\" Like those who had just escaped from their sins, they return to their own error, and persuade men to luxury, and to the delights of eating and the gratification of the flesh. For who is not glad to hear them say: \"Let us eat and drink, and reign for ever\"? The wise and prudent they call corrupt, but pay more attention to the honey-tongued. John the apostle, or rather the Saviour in the person of John, writes thus to the angel of the Church of Ephesus:[fn-66-P6639_2080552:49-nf] \"I know thy works and thy toil and patience, and that thou didst bear for my name's sake, and hast not grown weary. But I have this against thee, that thou didst leave thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come to thee, and will move thy candlestick out of its place, except thou repent.\" Similarly He urges the other churches, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, Laodicea, to repentance, and threatens them unless they return to the former works. And in Sardis He says He has a few who have not defiled their garments, and they shall walk with Him in white, for they are worthy. But they to whom He says: \"Remember from whence thou art fallen \"; and, \"Behold the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried\"; and, \"I know where thou dwellest, even where Satan's throne is\"; and, \"Remember how thou hast received, and didst hear, and keep it, and repent,\" and so on, were of course believers, and baptized, who once stood, but fell through sin.","title":"Book II.","author":false},{"chapter":21,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_108_revelation_of_saint_john_the_theologian_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"ANF-08","text":"And I spent seven days praying; and after this a cloud of light caught me up from the mountain, and set me before the face of the heaven.

For when one has received some benefit, his failing to attempt to make any return by at least the oral expression of thanks, where aught else is beyond his power, marks him out either as an utterly irrational person, or as one devoid of the sense of obligations conferred, or as a man without any memory. And, again, though[fn-5-P525_108936:21-nf] one is possessed naturally and at once by the sense and the knowledge of benefits received, yet, unless he also carries the memory of these obligations to future days, and offers some evidence of gratitude to the author of the boons, such a person is a dull, and ungrateful, and impious fellow; and he commits an offence which can be excused neither in the case of the great nor in that of the small:-if we suppose the case of a great, and high-minded man not bearing constantly on his lips his great benefits with all gratitude and honour, or that of a small and contemptible man not praising and lauding with all his might one who has been his benefactor, not simply in great services, but also in smaller. Upon the great, therefore, and those who excel in powers of mind, it is incumbent, as out of their greater abundance and larger wealth, to render greater and worthier praise, according to their capacity, to their benefactors. But the humble also, and those in narrow circumstances, it beseems neither to neglect those who do them service, nor to take their services carelessly, nor to flag in heart as if they could offer nothing worthy or perfect; but as poor indeed, and yet as of good feeling, and as measuring not the capacity of him whom they honour, but only their own, they ought to pay him honour according to the present measure of their power,-a tribute which will probably be grateful and pleasant to him who is honoured, and in no less consideration with him than it would have been had it been some great and splendid offering, if it is only presented with decided earnestness, and with a sincere mind. Thus is it laid down in the sacred writings,[fn-5-P526_110697:22-nf] that a certain poor and lowly woman, who was with the rich and powerful that were contributing largely and richly out of their wealth, alone and by herself cast in a small, yea, the very smallest offering, which was, however, all the while her whole substance, and received the testimony of having presented the largest oblation. For, as I judge, the sacred word has not set up the large outward quantity of the substance given, but rather the mind and disposition of the giver, as the standard by which the worth and the magnificence of the offering are to be measured. Wherefore it is not meet even for us by any means to shrink from this duty, through the fear that our thanksgivings be not adequate to our obligations; but, on the contrary, we ought to venture and attempt everything, so as to offer thanksgivings, if not adequate, at least such as we have it in our power to exhibit, as in due return. And would that our discourse, even though it comes short of the perfect measure, might at least reach the mark in some degree, and be saved from all appearance of ingratitude! For a persistent silence, maintained under the plausible cover of an inability to say anything worthy of the subject, is a vain and evil thing; but it is the mark of a good disposition always to make the attempt at a suitable return, even although the power of the person who offers the grateful acknowledgment be inferior to the desert of the subject. For my part, even although I am unable to speak as the matter merits, I shall not keep silence; but when I have done all that I possibly can, then I may congratulate myself. Be this, then, the method of my eucharistic discourse. To God, indeed, the God of the universe, I shall not think of speaking in such terms: yet is it from Him that all the beginnings of our blessings come; and with Him consequently is it that the beginning of our thanksgivings, or praises, or laudations, ought to be made. But, in truth, not even though i were to devote myself wholly to that duty, and that, too, not as i now am-to wit, profane and impure, and mixed up with and stained by every unhallowed[fn-5-P527_112836:23-nf] and polluting evil-but sincere and as pure as pure may be, and most genuine, and most unsophisticated, and uncontaminated by anything vile;-not even, I say, though I were thus to devote myself wholly, and with all the purity of the newly born, to this task, should I produce of myself any suitable gift in the way of honour and acknowledgment to the Ruler and Originator of all things, whom neither men separately and individually, nor yet all men in concert, acting with one spirit and one concordant impulse, as though all that is pure were made to meet in one, and all that is diverse from that were turned also to that service, could ever celebrate in a manner worthy of Him. For, in whatsoever measure any man is able to form right and adequate conceptions of His works, and (if such a thing were possible) to speak worthily regarding Him, then, so far as that very capacity is concerned,-a capacity with which he has not been gifted by any other one, but which he has received from Him alone, he cannot possibly find any greater matter of thanksgiving than what is implied in its possession.","title":"The Oration and Panegyric Addressed to Origen.","author":"Gregory Thaumaturgus"},{"chapter":21,"verse":34,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_113_discourse_v_thallousa_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"ANF-06","text":"I will now endeavour to explain to you, O virgins, the rest of that which is prescribed; for this is attached to your duties, consisting of laws concerning virginity, which are useful as teaching how we should abstain, and how advance to virginity. For it is written thus:[fn-51-P5148_1550533:16-nf] \"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to separate themselves unto the Lord; he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, and shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried, all the days of his separation.\" And this means, that he who has devoted and offered himself to the Lord shall not take of the fruits of the plant of evil, because of its natural tendency to produce intoxication and distraction of mind. For we perceive from the Scriptures two kinds of vines which were separate from each other, and were unlike. For the one is productive of immortality and righteousness; but the other of madness and insanity. The sober and joy-producing vine, from whose instructions, as from branches, there joyfully hang down clusters of graces, distilling love, is our Lord Jesus, who says expressly to the apostles,[fn-51-P5149_1551597:17-nf] \"I am the true vine, ye are the branches; and my Father is the husbandman.\" But the wild and death-bearing vine is the devil, who drops down fury and poison and wrath, as Moses relates, writing concerning him,[fn-51-P5150_1551831:18-nf] \"For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter: their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.\" The inhabitants of Sodom having gathered grapes from this, were goaded on to an unnatural and fruitless desire for males. Hence, also, in the time of Noah, men having given themselves tip to drunkenness, sank down into unbelief, and, being overwhelmed by the deluge, were drowned. And Cain, too, having drawn from this, stained his fratricidal hands, and defiled the earth with the blood of his own family. Hence, too, the heathen, becoming intoxicated, sharpen their passions for murderous battles; for man is not so much excited, nor goes so far astray through wine, as from anger and wrath. A man does not become intoxicated and go astray through wine, in the same way as he does from sorrow, or from love, or from incontinence. And therefore it is ordered that a virgin shall not taste of this vine, so that she may be sober and watchful from the cares of life, and may kindle the shining torch of the light of righteousness for the Word. \"Take heed to yourselves,\" says the Lord,[fn-51-P5151_1553041:19-nf] \"lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon yon unawares, as a snare.\"","title":"Discourse V.-Thallousa.","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":21,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_20_lecture_xv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"6.

With the exhortation of His fore-seeing word, instructing, and teaching, and preparing, and strengthening the people of His Church for all endurance of things to come, He predicted and said that wars, and famines, and earthquakes, and pestilences would arise in each place; and lest an unexpected and new dread of mischiefs should shake us, He previously warned us that adversity would increase more and more in the last times.

For if there is to be equality, where shall those abortions, supposing that they rise again, get that bulk which they had not here? Or if they shall not rise because they were not born but cast out, they raise the same question about children who have died in childhood, asking us whence they get the stature which we see they had not here; for we will not say that those who have been not only born, but born again, shall not rise again. Then, further, they ask of what size these equal bodies shall be. For if all shall be as tall and large as were the tallest and largest in this world, they ask us how it is that not only children but many full-grown persons shall receive what they here did not possess, if each one is to receive what he had here. And if the saying of the apostle, that we are all to come to the \"measure of the age of the fullness of Christ,\"[fn-44-P4424_2440297:27-nf] or that other saying, \"Whom He predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son,\"[fn-44-P4425_2440402:28-nf] is to be understood to mean that the stature and size of Christ's body shall be the measure of the bodies of all those who shall be in His kingdom, then, say they, the size and height of many must be diminished; and if so much of the bodily frame itself be lost, what becomes of the saying, \"Not a hair of your head shall perish?\" Besides, it might be asked regarding the hair itself, whether all that the barber has cut off shall be restored? And if it is to be restored, who would not shrink from such deformity? For as the same restoration will be made of what has been pared off the nails, much will be replaced on the body which a regard for its appearance had cut off. And where, then, will be its beauty, which assuredly ought to be much greater in that immortal condition than it could be in this corruptible state? On the other hand, if such things are not restored to the body, they must perish; how, then, they say, shall not a hair of the head perish? In like manner they reason about fatness and leanness; for if all are to be equal, then certainly there shall not be some fat, others lean. Some, therefore, shall gain, others lose something. Consequently there will not be a simple restoration of what formerly existed, but, on the one hand, an addition of what had no existence, and, on the other, a loss of what did before exist.","title":"Book XXII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":21,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_28_book_xxii","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"92","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"What, then, are we to say of infants, if not that they will not rise in that diminutive body in which they died, but shall receive by the marvellous and rapid operation of God that body which time by a slower process would have given them? For in the Lord's words, where He says, \"Not a hair of your head shall perish,\"[fn-44-P4433_2445068:29-nf] it is asserted that nothing which was possessed shall be wanting; but it is not said that nothing which was not possessed shall be given. To the dead infant there was wanting the perfect stature of its body; for even the perfect infant lacks the perfection of bodily size, being capable of further growth. This perfect stature is, in a sense, so possessed by all that they are conceived and born with it,-that is, they have it potentially, though not yet in actual bulk; just as all the members of the body are potentially in the seed, though, even after the child is born, some of them, the teeth for examplé, may be wanting. In this seminal principle of every substance, there seems to be, as it were, the beginning of everything which does not yet exist, or rather does not appear, but which in process of time will come into being, or rather into sight. In this, therefore, the child who is to be tall or short is already tall or short. And in the resurrection of the body, we need, for the same reason, fear no bodily loss; for though all should be of equal size, and reach gigantic proportions, lest the men who were largest here should lose anything of their bulk and it should perish, in contradiction to the words of Christ, who said that not a hair of their head should perish, yet why should there lack the means by which that wonderful Worker should make such additions, seeing that He is the Creator, who Himself created all things out of nothing?","title":"Book XXII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":21,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_118_treatise_viii_on_works_and_alms_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"ANF-05","text":"15. But you who are such as this, cannot labour in the Church. For your eyes, overcast with the gloom of blackness, and shadowed in night, do not see the needy and poor.

Consider in the Gospel the widow that remembered the heavenly precepts, doing good even amidst the difficulties and straits of poverty, casting two mites, which were all that she had, into the treasury; whom when the Lord observed and saw, regarding her work not for its abundance, but for its intention, and considering not how much, but from how much, she had given, He answered and said, \"Verily I say unto you, that that widow hath cast in more than they all into the offerings of God.

And although everything that is given is conferred upon widows and orphans, she gives, whom it behoved to receive, that we may know thence what punishment, awaits the barren rich man, when by this very instance even the poor ought to labour in good works. And in order that we may understand that their labours are given to God, and that whoever performs them deserves well of the Lord, Christ calls this \"the offerings of God,\" and intimates that the widow has cast in two farthings into the offerings of God, that it may be more abundantly evident that he who hath pity on the poor lendeth to God.","title":"Treatise VIII.

And therefore in this passage He forbids men \"to meditate before what they answer\" when brought before tribunals,[fn-68-P6898_2008520:1545-nf] even as once He suggested to Balaam the message which he had not thought of,[fn-68-P6899_2008623:1546-nf] nay, contrary to what he had thought; and promised \"a mouth\" to Moses, when he pleaded in excuse the slowness of his speech,[fn-69-P6900_2008774:1547-nf] and that wisdom which, by Isaiah, He showed to be irresistible: \"One shall say, I am the Lord's, and shall call himself by the name of Jacob, and another shall subscribe himself by the name of lsrµl.\"[fn-69-P6901_2008999:1548-nf] Now, what plea is wiser and more irresistible than the simple and open\"[fn-69-P6902_2009094:1549-nf] confession made in a martyr's cause, who \"prevails with God\"-which is what \"Israel\" means?[fn-69-P6903_2009202:1550-nf] Now, one cannot wonder that He forbade \"premeditation,\" who actually Himself received from the Father the ability of uttering words in season: \"The Lord hath given to me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season (to him that is weary); \"[fn-69-P6904_2009503:1551-nf] except that Marcion introduces to us a Christ who is not subject to the Father. That persecutions from one's nearest friends are predicted, and calumny out of hatred to His name,[fn-69-P6905_2009702:1552-nf] I need not again refer to. But \"by patience,\"[fn-69-P6906_2009775:1553-nf] says He, \"ye shall yourselves be saved.\"[fn-69-P6907_2009855:1554-nf] Of this very patience the Psalm says, \"The patient endurance of the just shall not perish for ever; \"[fn-69-P6908_2010006:1555-nf] because it is said in another Psalm, \"Precious (in the sight of the Lord) is the death of the just\"-arising, no doubt, out of their patient endurance, so that Zechariah declares: \"A crown shall be to them that endure.\"[fn-69-P6909_2010246:1556-nf] But that you may not boldly contend that it was as announcers of another god that the apostles were persecuted by the Jews, remember that even the prophets suffered the same treatment of the Jews, and that they were not the heralds of any other god than the Creator. Then, having shown what was to be the period of the destruction, even \"when Jerusalem should begin to be compassed with armies,\"[fn-69-P6910_2010774:1557-nf] He described the signs of the end of all things: \"portents in the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and upon the earth distress of nations in perplexity-like the sea roaring-by reason of their expectation of the evils which are coming on the earth.\"[fn-69-P6911_2011047:1558-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":21,"verse":26,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":41,"source_paragraph":"129","folder":"ANF-03","text":"That \"the very powers also of heaven have to be shaken,\"[fn-69-P6913_2011131:1559-nf] you may find in Joel: \"And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth-blood and fire, and pillars of smoke; the sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come.\"[fn-69-P6914_2011388:1560-nf] In Habakkuk also you have this statement: \"With rivers shall the earth be cleaved; the nations shall see thee, and be in pangs.

Since, therefore, these descriptions of the promises, on the one hand, agree together, as do also those of the great catastrophes, on the other-both in the predictions of the prophets and the declarations of the Lord, it will be impossible for you to interpose any distinction between them, as if the catastrophes could be referred to the Creator, as the terrible God, being such as the good god (of Marcion) ought not to permit, much less expect-whilst the promises should be ascribed to the good god, being such as the Creator, in His ignorance of the said god, could not have predicted. If, however, He did predict these promises as His own, since they differ in no respect from the promises of Christ, He will be a match in the freeness of His gifts with the good god himself; and evidently no more will have been promised by your Christ than by my Son of man. (If you examine) the whole passage of this Gospel Scripture, from the inquiry of the disciples[fn-69-P6926_2014878:1572-nf] down to the parable of the fig-tree[fn-69-P6927_2014939:1573-nf] you will find the sense in its connection suit in every point the Son of man, so that it consistently ascribes to Him both the sorrows and the joys, and the catastrophes and the promises; nor can you separate them from Him in either respect. For as much, then, as there is but one Son of man whose advent is placed between the two issues of catastrophe and promise, it must needs follow that to that one Son of man belong both the judgments upon the nations, and the prayers of the saints. He who thus comes in midway so as to be common to both issues, will terminate one of them by inflicting judgment on the nations at His coming; and will at the same time commence the other by fulfilling the prayers of His saints: so that if (on the one hand) you grant that the coming of the Son of man is (the advent) of my Christ, then, when you ascribe to Him the infliction of the judgments which precede His appearance, you are compelled also to assign to Him the blessings which issue from the same. If (on the other hand) you will have it that it is the coming of your Christ, then, when you ascribe to him the blessings which are to be the result of his advent, you are obliged to impute to him likewise the infliction of the evils which precede his appearance. For the evils which precede, and the blessings which immediately follow, the coming of the Son of man, are both alike indissolubly connected with that event. Consider, therefore, which of the two Christs you choose to place in the person of the Son of man, to whom you may refer the execution of the two dispensations. You make either the Creator a most beneficent God, or else your own god terrible in his nature! Reflect, in short, on the picture presented in the parable: \"Behold the fig-tree, and all the trees; when they produce their fruit, men know that summer is at hand. So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is very near.\"[fn-69-P6928_2016904:1574-nf] Now, if the fructification of the common trees[fn-69-P6929_2016977:1575-nf] be an antecedent sign of the approach of summer, so in like manner do the great conflicts of the world indicate the arrival of that kingdom which they precede. But every sign is His, to whom belong the thing of which it is the sign; and to everything is appointed its sign by Him to whom the thing belongs. If, therefore, these tribulations are the signs of the kingdom, just as the maturity of the trees is of the summer, it follows that the kingdom is the Creator's to whom are ascribed the tribulations which are the signs of the kingdom. Since the beneficent Deity had premised that these things must needs come to pass, although so terrible and dreadful, as they had been predicted by the law and the prophets, therefore He did not destroy the law and the prophets, when He affirmed that what had been foretold therein must be certainly fulfilled. He further declares, \"that heaven and earth shall not pass away till all things be fulfilled.\"[fn-69-P6930_2017948:1576-nf] What things, pray, are these? Are they the things which the Creator made? Then the elements will tractably endure the accomplishment of their Maker's dispensation. If, however, they emanate from your excellent god, I much doubt whether[fn-69-P6931_2018207:1577-nf] the heaven and earth will peaceably allow the completion of things which their Creator's enemy has determined! If the Creator quietly submits to this, then He is no \"jealous God.\" But let heaven and earth pass away, since their Lord has so determined; only let His word remain for evermore! And so Isaiah predicted that it should.[fn-69-P6932_2018558:1578-nf] Let the disciples also be warned, \"lest their hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and cares of this world; and so that day come upon them unawares, like a snare \"[fn-69-P6933_2018761:1579-nf] -if indeed they should forget God amidst the abundance and occupation of the world. Like this will be found the admonition of Moses,-so that He who delivers from \"the snare\" of that day is none other than He who so long before addressed to men the same admonition[fn-69-P6934_2019117:1580-nf] Some places there were in Jerusalem where to teach; other places outside Jerusalem whither to retire[fn-69-P6935_2019252:1581-nf] -\"in the day-time He was teaching in the temple; \"just as He had foretold by Hosea: \"In my house did they find me, and there did I speak with them.\"[fn-69-P6936_2019424:1582-nf] \"But at night He went out to the Mount of Olives.\" For thus had Zechariah pointed out: \"And His feet shall stand in that day on the Mount of Olives.\"[fn-69-P6937_2019658:1583-nf] Fit hours for an audience there also were. \"Early in the morning\"[fn-69-P6938_2019747:1584-nf] must they resort to Him, who (having said by Isaiah, \"The Lord giveth me the tongue of the learned\") added, \"He hath appointed me the morning, and hath also given me an ear to hear.\"[fn-69-P6939_2019953:1585-nf] Now if this is to destroy the prophets,[fn-69-P6940_2020013:1586-nf] what will it be to fulfil them?","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":21,"verse":27,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":41,"source_paragraph":"129","folder":"ANF-03","text":"That \"the very powers also of heaven have to be shaken,\"[fn-69-P6913_2011131:1559-nf] you may find in Joel: \"And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth-blood and fire, and pillars of smoke; the sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come.\"[fn-69-P6914_2011388:1560-nf] In Habakkuk also you have this statement: \"With rivers shall the earth be cleaved; the nations shall see thee, and be in pangs.

He who thus comes in midway so as to be common to both issues, will terminate one of them by inflicting judgment on the nations at His coming; and will at the same time commence the other by fulfilling the prayers of His saints: so that if (on the one hand) you grant that the coming of the Son of man is (the advent) of my Christ, then, when you ascribe to Him the infliction of the judgments which precede His appearance, you are compelled also to assign to Him the blessings which issue from the same.

For as much, then, as there is but one Son of man whose advent is placed between the two issues of catastrophe and promise, it must needs follow that to that one Son of man belong both the judgments upon the nations, and the prayers of the saints. He who thus comes in midway so as to be common to both issues, will terminate one of them by inflicting judgment on the nations at His coming; and will at the same time commence the other by fulfilling the prayers of His saints: so that if (on the one hand) you grant that the coming of the Son of man is (the advent) of my Christ, then, when you ascribe to Him the infliction of the judgments which precede His appearance, you are compelled also to assign to Him the blessings which issue from the same.

If, therefore, these tribulations are the signs of the kingdom, just as the maturity of the trees is of the summer, it follows that the kingdom is the Creator's to whom are ascribed the tribulations which are the signs of the kingdom. Since the beneficent Deity had premised that these things must needs come to pass, although so terrible and dreadful, as they had been predicted by the law and the prophets, therefore He did not destroy the law and the prophets, when He affirmed that what had been foretold therein must be certainly fulfilled. He further declares, \"that heaven and earth shall not pass away till all things be fulfilled.\"[fn-69-P6930_2017948:1576-nf] What things, pray, are these? Are they the things which the Creator made? Then the elements will tractably endure the accomplishment of their Maker's dispensation. If, however, they emanate from your excellent god, I much doubt whether[fn-69-P6931_2018207:1577-nf] the heaven and earth will peaceably allow the completion of things which their Creator's enemy has determined! If the Creator quietly submits to this, then He is no \"jealous God.\" But let heaven and earth pass away, since their Lord has so determined; only let His word remain for evermore! And so Isaiah predicted that it should.[fn-69-P6932_2018558:1578-nf] Let the disciples also be warned, \"lest their hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and cares of this world; and so that day come upon them unawares, like a snare \"[fn-69-P6933_2018761:1579-nf] -if indeed they should forget God amidst the abundance and occupation of the world. Like this will be found the admonition of Moses,-so that He who delivers from \"the snare\" of that day is none other than He who so long before addressed to men the same admonition[fn-69-P6934_2019117:1580-nf] Some places there were in Jerusalem where to teach; other places outside Jerusalem whither to retire[fn-69-P6935_2019252:1581-nf] -\"in the day-time He was teaching in the temple; \"just as He had foretold by Hosea: \"In my house did they find me, and there did I speak with them.\"[fn-69-P6936_2019424:1582-nf] \"But at night He went out to the Mount of Olives.\" For thus had Zechariah pointed out: \"And His feet shall stand in that day on the Mount of Olives.\"[fn-69-P6937_2019658:1583-nf] Fit hours for an audience there also were. \"Early in the morning\"[fn-69-P6938_2019747:1584-nf] must they resort to Him, who (having said by Isaiah, \"The Lord giveth me the tongue of the learned\") added, \"He hath appointed me the morning, and hath also given me an ear to hear.\"[fn-69-P6939_2019953:1585-nf] Now if this is to destroy the prophets,[fn-69-P6940_2020013:1586-nf] what will it be to fulfil them?","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":21,"verse":38,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":41,"source_paragraph":"129","folder":"ANF-03","text":"That \"the very powers also of heaven have to be shaken,\"[fn-69-P6913_2011131:1559-nf] you may find in Joel: \"And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth-blood and fire, and pillars of smoke; the sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come.\"[fn-69-P6914_2011388:1560-nf] In Habakkuk also you have this statement: \"With rivers shall the earth be cleaved; the nations shall see thee, and be in pangs. Thou shalt disperse the waters with thy step; the deep uttered its voice; the height of its fear was raised;[fn-69-P6915_2011652:1561-nf] the sun and the moon stood still in their course; into light shall thy coruscations go; and thy shield shall be (like) the glittering of the lightning's flash; in thine anger thou shalt grind the earth, and shalt thresh the nations in thy wrath.\"[fn-69-P6916_2011954:1562-nf] There is thus an agreement, I apprehend, between the sayings of the Lord and of the prophets touching the shaking of the earth, and the elements, and the nations thereof. But what does the Lord say afterwards? \"And then shall they see the Son of man coming from the heavens with very great power. And when these things shall come to pass, ye shall look up, and raise your heads; for your redemption hath come near,\" that is, at the time of the kingdom, of which the parable itself treats.[fn-69-P6917_2012481:1563-nf] \"So likewise ye, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.\"[fn-69-P6918_2012620:1564-nf] This will be the great day of the Lord, and of the glorious coming of the Son of man from heaven, of which Daniel wrote: \"Behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven,\"[fn-69-P6919_2012830:1565-nf] etc. \"And there was given unto Him the kingly power,\"[fn-69-P6920_2012907:1566-nf] which (in the parable) \"He went away into a far country to receive for Himself,\" leaving money to His servants wherewithal to trade and get increase[fn-69-P6921_2013079:1567-nf] -even (that universal kingdom of) all nations, which in the Psalm the Father had promised to give to Him: Ask of me, and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance.\"[fn-69-P6922_2013285:1568-nf] \"And all that glory shall serve Him; His dominion shall be an everlasting one, which shall not be taker from Him, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed,\"[fn-69-P6923_2013471:1569-nf] because in it \"men shall not die, neither shall they marry, but be like the angels.\"[fn-69-P6924_2013579:1570-nf] It is about the same advent of the Son of man and the benefits thereof that we read in Habakkuk: \"Thou wentest forth for the salvation of Thy people, even to save Thine anointed ones,[fn-69-P6925_2013789:1571-nf] -in other words, those who shall look up and lift their heads, being redeemed in the time of His kingdom. Since, therefore, these descriptions of the promises, on the one hand, agree together, as do also those of the great catastrophes, on the other-both in the predictions of the prophets and the declarations of the Lord, it will be impossible for you to interpose any distinction between them, as if the catastrophes could be referred to the Creator, as the terrible God, being such as the good god (of Marcion) ought not to permit, much less expect-whilst the promises should be ascribed to the good god, being such as the Creator, in His ignorance of the said god, could not have predicted. If, however, He did predict these promises as His own, since they differ in no respect from the promises of Christ, He will be a match in the freeness of His gifts with the good god himself; and evidently no more will have been promised by your Christ than by my Son of man. (If you examine) the whole passage of this Gospel Scripture, from the inquiry of the disciples[fn-69-P6926_2014878:1572-nf] down to the parable of the fig-tree[fn-69-P6927_2014939:1573-nf] you will find the sense in its connection suit in every point the Son of man, so that it consistently ascribes to Him both the sorrows and the joys, and the catastrophes and the promises; nor can you separate them from Him in either respect. For as much, then, as there is but one Son of man whose advent is placed between the two issues of catastrophe and promise, it must needs follow that to that one Son of man belong both the judgments upon the nations, and the prayers of the saints. He who thus comes in midway so as to be common to both issues, will terminate one of them by inflicting judgment on the nations at His coming; and will at the same time commence the other by fulfilling the prayers of His saints: so that if (on the one hand) you grant that the coming of the Son of man is (the advent) of my Christ, then, when you ascribe to Him the infliction of the judgments which precede His appearance, you are compelled also to assign to Him the blessings which issue from the same. If (on the other hand) you will have it that it is the coming of your Christ, then, when you ascribe to him the blessings which are to be the result of his advent, you are obliged to impute to him likewise the infliction of the evils which precede his appearance. For the evils which precede, and the blessings which immediately follow, the coming of the Son of man, are both alike indissolubly connected with that event. Consider, therefore, which of the two Christs you choose to place in the person of the Son of man, to whom you may refer the execution of the two dispensations. You make either the Creator a most beneficent God, or else your own god terrible in his nature! Reflect, in short, on the picture presented in the parable: \"Behold the fig-tree, and all the trees; when they produce their fruit, men know that summer is at hand. So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is very near.\"[fn-69-P6928_2016904:1574-nf] Now, if the fructification of the common trees[fn-69-P6929_2016977:1575-nf] be an antecedent sign of the approach of summer, so in like manner do the great conflicts of the world indicate the arrival of that kingdom which they precede. But every sign is His, to whom belong the thing of which it is the sign; and to everything is appointed its sign by Him to whom the thing belongs. If, therefore, these tribulations are the signs of the kingdom, just as the maturity of the trees is of the summer, it follows that the kingdom is the Creator's to whom are ascribed the tribulations which are the signs of the kingdom. Since the beneficent Deity had premised that these things must needs come to pass, although so terrible and dreadful, as they had been predicted by the law and the prophets, therefore He did not destroy the law and the prophets, when He affirmed that what had been foretold therein must be certainly fulfilled. He further declares, \"that heaven and earth shall not pass away till all things be fulfilled.\"[fn-69-P6930_2017948:1576-nf] What things, pray, are these? Are they the things which the Creator made?

Again, what is given by Matthew in the following terms: \"Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains; and let him which is on the house-top not come down to take anything out of his house; neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes,\"[fn-21-P2184_911404:536-nf] is reported also by Mark almost in so many words. On the other hand, Luke's version proceeds thus: \"Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains.\"[fn-21-P2185_911588:537-nf] Thus far he agrees with the other two. But he presents what is subsequent to that in a different form. For he goes on to say, \"And let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto: for these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.\" Now these statements seem to present differences enough between each other. For the one, as it occurs in the first two evangelists, runs thus: \"Let him which is on the house-top not come down to take anything out of his house;\" whereas what is given by the third evangelist is to this effect: \"And let them which are in the midst of it depart out.\" The import, however, may be, that in the great agitation which will arise in the face of so mighty an impending peril, those shut up in the state of siege (which is expressed by the phrase, \"they which are in the midst of it\") will appear upon the housetop [or \"wall\"], amazed and anxious to see what terror hangs over them, or what method of escape may open. Still the question rises, How does this third evangelist say here, \"let them depart out,\" when he has already used these terms: \"And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with an army\"? For what is brought in after this-namely, the sentence, \"And let not them that are in the countries enter there-into \"-appears to form part of one consistent admonition; and we can perceive how those who are outside the city are not to enter into it; but the difficulty is to see how those who are in the midst of it are to depart out, when the city is already compassed with an army. Well, may not this expression, \"in the midst of it,\" indicate a time when the danger will be so urgent as to leave no opportunity open, so far as temporal means are concerned, for the preservation of this present life in the body, and that the fact that this will be a time when the soul ought to be ready and free, and neither taken up with, nor burdened by, carnal desires, is imported by the phrase employed by the first two writers-namely, \"on the house-top,\" or, \"on the wall\"? In this way the third evangelist's phraseology, \"let them depart out\" (which really means, let them no more be engrossed with the desire of this life, but let them be prepared to pass into another life), is equivalent in sense to the terms used by the other two,\" let him not come down to take anything out of his house\" (which really means, \"let not his affections turn towards the flesh, as if it could yield him anything to his advantage then\"). And in like manner the phrase adopted by the one, \"And let not them that are in the countries enter thereunto\" (which is to say, \"Let not those who, with good purpose of heart, have already placed themselves outside it, indulge again in any carnal lust or longing after it\"), denotes precisely what the other two evangelists embody in the sentence, \"Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes,\" which is much the same as to state that he should not again involve himself in cares of which he had been unburdened.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":21,"verse":34,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":79,"source_paragraph":"314","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"151. Moreover, Matthew proceeds thus: \"But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath-day.\" Part of this is given and part omitted by Mark, when he says, \"And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.\" Luke, on the other hand, leaves this out entirely, and instead of it introduces something which is peculiar to himself, and by which he appears to me to have cast light upon this very clause which has been set before us somewhat obscurely by these others. For his version runs thus: \"And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass.\"[fn-21-P2187_915586:538-nf] This is to be understood to be the same flight as is mentioned by Matthew, which should not be taken in the winter or on the Sabbath-day. That \"winter,\" moreover, refers to these \"cares of this life\" which Luke has specified directly; and the \"Sabbath-day\" refers in like manner to the \"surfeiting and drunkenness.\" For sad cares are like a winter; and surfeiting and drunkenness drown and bury the heart in carnal delights and luxury-an evil which is expressed under the term \"Sabbath-day,\" because of old, as is the case with them still, the Jews had the very pernicious custom of rePelling in pleasure on that day, when they were ignorant of the spiritual Sabbath. Or, if something else is intended by the words whichthus appear in Matthew and Mark, Luke's termsmay also be taken to bear on something else, while no question implying any antagonism between them need be raised for all that. At present, however, we have not undertaken the task of expounding the Gospels, but only that of defending them against groundless charges of falsehood and deceit. Furthermore, other matters which Matthew has inserted in this discourse, and which are common to him and Mark, present no difficulty. On the other hand, with respect to those sections which are common to him and Luke, [it is to be remarked that] these are not introduced into the present discourse by Luke, although in regard to the order of narration here they are at one. But he records sentences of like tenor in other connections, either reproducing them as they suggested themselves to his memory, and thus bringing them in by anticipation so as to relate at an earlier point words which, as spoken by the Lord, belong really to a later; or else, giving us tounderstand that they were uttered twice over by the Lord, once on the occasion referred to by Matthew, and on a second occasion, with which Luke himself deals.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":21,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_15_book_iv_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"29","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"8.

This narrative, however, of the poor widow who cast two mites into the treasury is reported only by two of them, namely, Mark and Luke.[fn-27-P2791_1235558:31-nf] But their harmony admits of no question. And from this point onwards to the Lord's Supper, which latter act formed the starting-point for our discussion of all the records of the four evangelists taken conjointly, Mark introduces nothing of a kind to make it necessary for us to institute a special comparison between it and any other statement, or to conduct an inquiry with the view of dispelling any appearance of discrepancy.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":21,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_121_treatise_xi_exhortation_to_martyrdom_addressed_to_fortunatus_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"43","folder":"ANF-05","text":"John, in his epistle, proves this, saying: \"Greater is He who is in you than he that is in the world.\"[fn-78-P7847_2629305:70-nf] Also in the cxviith Psalm: \"I will not fear what man can do unto me; the Lord is my helper.\"[fn-78-P7848_2629417:71-nf] And again: \"These in chariots, and those in horses; bat we will glory in the name of the Lord our God.

One hope have I sought of the Lord, this will I require; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.\"[fn-78-P7851_2630366:74-nf] Also in Exodus, the Holy Scripture declares that we are rather multiplied and increased by afflictions, saying: \"And the more they afflicted them, so much the more they became greater, and waxed stronger.\"[fn-78-P7852_2630635:75-nf] And in the Apocalypse, divine protection is promised to our sufferings. \"Fear nothing of these things,\" it says, \"which thou shalt suffer.\"[fn-78-P7853_2630792:76-nf] Nor does any one else promise to us security and protection, than He who also speaks by Isaiah the prophet, saying: \"Fear not; for I have redeemed thee, and called thee by thy name: thou art mine. And if thou passest through the water, I am with thee, and the rivers shall not overflow thee. And if thou passest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned, and[fn-78-P7854_2631170:77-nf] the flame shall not burn thee; for I, the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, am He who maketh thee safe.\"[fn-78-P7855_2631343:78-nf] Who also promises in the Gospel that divine help shall not be wanting to God's servants in persecutions, saying: \"But when they shall deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak. For it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak. For it is not ye who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaketh in you.\"[fn-78-P7856_2631699:79-nf] And again: \"Settle it in your hearts not to meditate before how to answer. For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which your adversaries shall not be able to resist.\"[fn-78-P7857_2631889:80-nf] As in Exodus God speaks to Moses when he delayed and trembled to go to the people, saying: \"Who hath given a mouth to man? and who hath made the stammerer? and who the deaf man? and who the seeing, and the blind man?

Now, inasmuch as the beginning: occupies the first place in the condition of all things, so it must necessarily take precedence in the treatment of them, if a clear knowledge is to be arrived at concerning their condition; for you could not find the means of examining even the quality of anything, unless you were certain of its existence, and that after discovering its origin.[fn-71-P7143_2071877:1-nf] Since therefore I am brought, in the course of my little work, to this point,[fn-71-P7144_2071983:2-nf] I require to know of Marcion the origin of his apostles[fn-71-P7145_2072052:3-nf] even-I, who am to some degree a new disciple,[fn-71-P7146_2072991:4-nf] the follower of no other master; who at the same time[fn-71-P7147_2073073:5-nf] can believe nothing, except that nothing ought to be believed hastily[fn-71-P7148_2073155:6-nf] (and that I may further say is hastily believed, which is believed without any examination[fn-71-P7149_2073257:7-nf] of its beginning); in short, I who have the best reason possible for bringing this inquiry to a most careful solution,[fn-71-P7150_2073390:8-nf] since a man is affirmed to me to be an apostle whom I do not find mentioned in the Gospel in the catalogue[fn-71-P7151_2073519:9-nf] of the apostles. Indeed, when I hear that this man was chosen by the Lord after He had attained His rest in heaven, I feel that a kind of improvidence is imputable to Christ, for not knowing before that this man was necessary to Him; and because He thought that he must be added to the apostolic body in the way of a fortuitous encounter[fn-71-P7152_2073870:10-nf] rather than a deliberate selection; by necessity (so to speak), and not voluntary choice, although the members of the apostolate had been duly ordained, and were now dismissed to their several missions. Wherefore, O shipmaster of Pontus,[fn-71-P7153_2074230:11-nf] if you have never taken on board your small craft[fn-71-P7154_2074522:12-nf] any contraband goods or smuggler's cargo, if you have never thrown overboard or tampered with a freight, you are still more careful and conscientious, I doubt not, in divine things; and so I should be glad if you would inform us under what bill of lading[fn-71-P7155_2074798:13-nf] you admitted the Apostle Paul on board, who ticketed him,[fn-71-P7156_2074874:14-nf] what owner forwarded him,[fn-71-P7157_2074947:15-nf] who handed him to you,[fn-71-P7158_2074999:16-nf] that so you may land him without any misgiving,[fn-71-P7159_2075069:17-nf] lest he should turn out to belong to him,[fn-71-P7160_2075128:18-nf] who can substantiate his claim to him by producing all his apostolic writings.[fn-71-P7161_2075316:19-nf] He professes himself to be \"an apostle\"-to use his own, words-\"not of men, nor by man, but by Jesus Christ.\"[fn-71-P7162_2075466:20-nf] Of course, any one may make a profession concerning himself; but his profession is only rendered valid by the authority of a second person. One man signs, another countersigns;[fn-71-P7163_2075659:21-nf] one man appends his seal, another registers in the public records.[fn-71-P7164_2075743:22-nf] No one is at once a proposer and a seconder to himself. Besides, you have read, no doubt, that \"many shall come, saying, I am Christ.\"[fn-71-P7165_2075897:23-nf] Now if any one can pretend that he is Christ, how much more might a man profess to be an apostle of Christ! But still, for my own part, I appear[fn-71-P7166_2076060:24-nf] in the character of a disciple and an inquirer; that so I may even thus[fn-71-P7167_2076148:25-nf] both refute your belief, who have nothing to support it, and confound your shamelessness, who make claims without possessing the means of establishing them. Let there be a Christ, let there be an apostle, although of another god; but what matter? since they are only to draw their proofs out of the Testament of the Creator. Because even the book of Genesis so long ago promised me the Apostle Paul. For among the types and prophetic blessings which he pronounced over his sons, Jacob, when he turned his attention to Benjamin, exclaimed, \"Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf; in the morning He shall devour the prey, and at night he shall impart nourishment.\"[fn-71-P7168_2076819:26-nf] He foresaw that Paul would arise out of the tribe of Benjamin, a voracious wolf, devouring his prey in the morning: in order words, in the early period of his life he would devastate the Lord's sheep, as a persecutor of the churches; but in the evening he would give them nourishment, which means that in his declining years he would educate the fold of Christ, as the teacher of the Gentiles. Then, again, in Saul's conduct towards David, exhibited first in violent persecution of him, and then in remorse and reparation,[fn-71-P7169_2077439:27-nf] on his receiving from him good for evil, we have nothing else than an anticipation[fn-71-P7170_2077540:28-nf] of Paul in Saul-belonging, too, as they did, to the same tribe-and of Jesus in David, from whom He descended according to the Virgin's genealogy.[fn-71-P7171_2077719:29-nf] Should you, however, disapprove of these types,[fn-71-P7172_2077798:30-nf] the Acts of the Apostles,[fn-71-P7173_2077851:31-nf] at all events, have handed down to me this career of Paul, which you must not refuse to accept. Thence I demonstrate that from a persecutor he became \"an apostle, not of men, neither by man; \"[fn-71-P7174_2079049:32-nf] thence am I led to believe the Apostle himself; thence do I find reason for rejecting your defence of him,[fn-71-P7175_2079172:33-nf] and for bearing fearlessly your taunt. \"Then you deny the Apostle Paul.\" I do not calumniate him whom I defend.[fn-71-P7176_2079324:34-nf] I deny him, to compel you to the proof of him. I deny him, to convince you that he is mine. If you have regard to our belief you should admit the particulars which comprise it. If you challenge us to your belief, (pray) tell us what things constitute its basis.[fn-71-P7177_2079677:35-nf] Either prove the truth of what you believe, or failing in your proof, (tell us) how you believe. Else what conduct is yours,[fn-71-P7178_2079824:36-nf] believing in opposition to Him from whom alone comes the proof of that which you believe? Take now from my point of view[fn-71-P7179_2079961:37-nf] the apostle, in the same manner as you have received the Christ-the apostle shown to be as much mine as the Christ is. And here, too, we will fight within the same lines, and challenge our adversary on the mere ground of a simple rule,[fn-71-P7180_2080221:38-nf] that even an apostle who is said not to belong to the Creator-nay, is displayed as in actual hostility to the Creator-can be fairly regarded as teaching[fn-71-P7181_2080410:39-nf] nothing, knowing nothing, wishing nothing in favour of the Creator whilst it would be a first principle with him to set forth[fn-71-P7182_2080571:40-nf] another god with as much eagerness as he would use in withdrawing us from the law of the Creator. It is not at all likely that he would call men away from Judaism without showing them at the same time what was the god in whom he invited them to believe; because nobody could possibly pass from allegiance to the Creator without knowing to whom he had to cross over. For either Christ had already revealed another god-in which case the apostle's testimony would also follow to the same effect, for fear of his not being else regarded[fn-71-P7183_2081118:41-nf] as an apostle of the god whom Christ had revealed, and because of the impropriety of his being concealed by the apostle who had been already revealed by Christ-or Christ had made no such revelation concerning God; then there was all the greater need why the apostle should reveal a God who could now be made known by no one else, and who would undoubtedly be left without any belief at all, if he were revealed not even by an apostle. We have laid down this as our first principle, because we wish at once to profess that we shall pursue the same method here in the apostle's case as we adopted before in Christ's case, to prove that he proclaimed no new god;[fn-71-P7184_2081801:42-nf] that is, we shall draw our evidence from the epistles of St. Paul himself. Now, the garbled form in which we have found the heretic's Gospel will have already prepared us to expect to find[fn-71-P7185_2082026:43-nf] the epistles also mutilated by him with like perverseness-and that even as respects their number.[fn-71-P7186_2082152:44-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":21,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"361","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In the Gospel according to Luke: \"And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.\"[fn-88-P8827_2838936:558-nf] Also according to John: \"If the world hate you, know ye that it first hated me.

The Lord saith, \"In your patience ye shall possess your souls:\"[fn-47-P4738_2336826:8-nf] He saith not, your farms, your praises, your luxuries; but, \"your souls.\" If then the soul endures so great sufferings that it may possess that whereby it may be lost, how great ought it to bear that it may not be lost? And then, to mention a thing not culpable, if it bear so great sufferings for saving of the flesh under the hands of chirurgeons cutting or burning the same, how great ought it to bear for saving of itself under the fury of any soever enemies?

Or is he only employing what appears to be a figure of speech,[fn-80-P8085_1985022:48-nf] in pretending to have something to say, while in reality he had nothing to produce beyond the Gospel narrative which could impress the hearer with a feeling of its truth, and furnish a clear ground of accusation against Jesus and His doctrine? And he charges the disciples with having invented the statement that Jesus foreknew and foretold all that happened to Him; but the truth of this statement we shall establish, although Celsus may not like it, by means of many other predictions uttered by the Saviour, in which He foretold what would befall the Christians in after generations. And who is there who would not be astonished at this prediction: \"Ye shall be brought before governors and kings for My sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles; \"[fn-80-P8086_1985817:49-nf] and at any others which He may have delivered respecting the future persecution of His disciples? For what system of opinions ever existed among men on account of which others are punished, so that any one of the accusers of Jesus could say that, foreseeing the impiety or falsity of his opinions to be the ground of an accusation against them he thought that this would redound to his credit, that he had so predicted regarding it long before? Now if any deserve to be brought, on account of their opinions, before governors and kings, what others are they, save the Epicureans, who altogether deny the existence of providence? And also the Peripatetics, who say that prayers are of no avail, and sacrifices offered as to the Divinity? But some one will say that the Samaritans suffer persecution because of their religion. In answer to whom we shall state that the Sicarians,[fn-80-P8087_1986713:50-nf] on account of the practice of circumcision, as mutilating themselves contrary to the established laws and the customs permitted to the Jews alone, are put to death. And you never hear a judge inquiring whether a Sicarian who strives to live according to this established religion of his will be released from punishment if he apostatizes, but will be led away to death if he continues firm; for the evidence of the circumcision is sufficient to ensure the death of him who has undergone it. But Christians alone, according to the prediction of their Saviour, \"Ye shall be brought before governors and kings for My sake,\" are urged up to their last breath by their judges to deny Christianity, and to sacrifice according to the public customs; and after the oath of abjuration, to return to their homes, and to live in safety. And observe whether it is not with great authority that this declaration is uttered: \"Whosoever therefore shall confess Me before men, him will I confess also before My Father who is in heaven. And whosoever shall deny Me before men,\"[fn-80-P8088_1987989:51-nf] etc. And go back with me in thought to Jesus when He uttered these words, and see His predictions not yet accomplished. Perhaps you will say, in a spirit of incredulity, that he is talking folly, and speaking to no purpose, for his words will have no fulfilment; or, being in doubt about assenting to his words, you will say, that if these predictions be fulfilled, and the doctrine of Jesus be established, so that governors and kings think of destroying those who acknowledge Jesus, then we shall believe that he utters these prophecies as one who has received great power from God to implant this doctrine among the human race, and as believing that it will prevail. And who will not be filled with wonder, when he goes back in thought to Him who then taught and said, \"This Gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles,\"[fn-80-P8089_1988886:52-nf] and beholds, agreeably to His words, the Gospel of Jesus Christ preached in the whole world under heaven to Greeks and Barbarians, wise and foolish alike?

But let this Jew of Celsus, who does not believe that He foreknew all that happened to Him, consider how, while Jerusalem was still standing, and the whole Jewish worship celebrated in it, Jesus foretold what would befall it from the hand of the Romans. For they will not maintain that the acquaintances and pupils of Jesus Himself handed down His teaching contained in the Gospels without committing it to writing, and left His disciples without the memoirs of Jesus contained in their works.[fn-80-P8090_1989740:53-nf] Now in these it is recorded, that \"when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed about with armies, then shall ye know that the desolation thereof is nigh.\"[fn-80-P8091_1990396:54-nf] But at that time there were no armies around Jerusalem, encompassing and enclosing and besieging it; for the siege began in the reign of Nero, and lasted till the government of Vespasian, whose son Titus destroyed Jerusalem, on account, as Josephus says, of James the Just, the brother of Jesus who was called Christ, but in reality, as the truth makes dear, on account of Jesus Christ the Son of God.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":21,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_61_book_iii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"87","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Si resurrectionem itaque receperint, ut ipsi dienut, et ideo matrimonium infirmant et abrogant; nec comedant, nec bibant: \"destrui\" enim \"ventrem et cibos,\" dicit Apostolus in resurrectione.

Let us sacrifice not young calves, nor lambs that put forth horns and hoofs,[fn-59-P5972_2060778:74-nf] in which many parts are destitute of life and feeling; but let us sacrifice to God the sacrifice of praise upon the heavenly Altar, with the heavenly dances; let us hold aside the first veil; let us approach the second, and look into the Holy of Holies.[fn-59-P5973_2061054:75-nf] Shall I say that which is a greater thing yet? Let us sacrifice ourselves to God; or rather let us go on sacrificing throughout every day and at every moment. Let us accept anything for the Word's sake.

And among the rest we have especially to admire this instance of His goodness, that He was not silent concerning those who should fight against us, but plainly told us beforehand, that, when those things should come to pass, we might straightway be found with minds established by His teaching. For He said, `There shall arise false prophets and false Christs, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, the very elect shall be deceived. Behold, I have told you before[fn-39-P3916_1648176:3-nf] .' Manifold indeed and beyond human conception are the instructions and gifts of grace which He has laid up in us; as the pattern of heavenly conversation, power against demons, the adoption of sons, and that exceeding great and singular grace, the knowledge of the Father and of the Word Himself, and the gift of the Holy Ghost. But the mind of man is prone to evil exceedingly; moreover, our adversary the devil, envying us the possession of such great blessings, goeth about seeking to snatch away the seed of the word which is sown within us. Wherefore as if by His prophetic warnings He would seal up His instructions in our hearts as His own peculiar treasure, the Lord said, `Take heed that no man deceive you: for many shall come in My name, saying, I am he; and the time draweth near; and they shall deceive many: go ye not therefore after them[fn-39-P3917_1649065:4-nf] .' This is a great gift which the Word has bestowed upon us, that we should not be deceived by appearances, but that, howsoever these things are concealed, we should all the more distinguish them by the grace of the Spirit. For whereas the inventor of wickedness and great spirit of evil, the devil, is utterly hateful, and as soon as he shews himself is rejected[fn-39-P3918_1649445:5-nf] of all men,-as a serpent, as a dragon, as a lion seeking whom he may seize upon and devour,-therefore he conceals and covers what he really is, and craftily personates that Name which all men desire, so that deceiving by a false appearance, he may thenceforth fix fast in his own chains those whom he has led astray. And as if one that desired to kidnap the children of others during the absence of their parents, should personate their appearance, and so putting a cheat on the affections of the offspring, should carry them far away and destroy them; in like manner this evil and wily spirit the devil, having no confidence in himself, and knowing the love which men bear to the truth, personates its appearance, and so spreads his own poison among those that follow after him.","title":"To the Bishops of Egypt","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":21,"verse":20,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_18_part_ii_dogmatical_and_historical_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"83","folder":"ANF-05","text":"62.

For we shall be rightly attacked with rebukes, and through our fault ungodly tongues will arm themselves to do harm to religion, if the conduct of those that fast is at variance with the standard of perfect purity. For our fast does not consist chiefly of mere abstinence from food, nor are dainties withdrawn from our bodily appetites with profit, unless the mind is recalled from wrong-doing and the tongue restrained from slandering. This is a time of gentleness and long-suffering, of peace and tranquillity: when all the pollutions of vice are to be eradicated and continuance of virtue is to be attained by us. Now let godly minds boldly accustom themselves to forgive faults, to pass over insults, and to forget wrongs. Now let the faithful spirit train himself with the armour of righteousness on the fight hand and on the left, that through honour and dishonour, through ill repute and good repute, the conscience may be undisturbed in unwavering uprightness, not puffed up by praise and not wearied out by revilings. The self-restraint of the religious should not be gloomy, but sincere; no murmurs of complaint should be heard from those who are never without the consolation of holy joys. The decrease of worldly means should not be feared in the practice of works of mercy. Christian poverty is always rich, because what it has is more than what it has not. Nor does the poor man fear to labour in this world, to whom it is given to possess all things in the Lord of all things. Therefore those who do the things which are good must have no manner of fear lest the power of doing should fail them; since in the gospel the widow's devotion is extolled in the case of her two mites, and voluntary bounty gets its reward for a cup of cold water[fn-34-P3406_842503:3-nf] . For the measure of our charitableness is fixed by the sincerity of our feelings, and he that shows mercy on others will never want for mercy himself. The holy widow of Sarepta discovered this, who offered the blessed Elias in the time of famine one day's food, which was all she had, and putting the prophet's hunger before her own needs, ungrudgingly gave up a handful of corn and a little oil[fn-34-P3407_842975:4-nf] .

The Holy Spirit, too, is numbered with the Father and the Son, because He is above creation, and is ranked as we are taught by the words of the Lord in the Gospel, \"Go and baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-33-P3382_1106983:7-nf] He who, on the contrary, places the Spirit before the Son, or alleges Him to be older than the Father, resists the ordinance of God, and is a stranger to the sound faith, since he fails to preserve the form of doxology which he has received, but adopts some new fangled device in order to be pleasing to men. It is written \"The Spirit is of God,\"[fn-33-P3383_1107399:8-nf] and if He is of God, how can He be older than that of which He is? And what folly is it not, when there is one Unbegotten, to speak of something else as superior to the Unbegotten? He is not even anterior, for nothing intervenes between Son and Father. If, however, He is not of God but is through Christ, He does not even exist at all. It follows, that this new invention about the order really involves the destruction of the actual existence, and is a denial of the whole faith. It is equally impious to reduce Him to the level of a creature, and to subordinate Him either to Son or to Father, either in time or in rank. These are the points on which I have heard that you are making enquiry. If the Lord grant that we meet I may possibly have more to say on these subjects, and may myself, concerning points which I am investigating, receive satisfactory information from you.","title":"Letter LII","author":"St. Basil"}]
