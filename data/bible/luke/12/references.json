Then, after this human love has nourished and invigorated the mind cleaving to thy breast, and fitted it for following God, when the divine majesty has begun to disclose itself as far as suffices for man while a dweller on the earth, such fervent charity is produced, and such a flame of divine love is kindled, that by the burning out of all vices, and by the purification and sanctification of the man, it becomes plain how divine are these words, \"I am a consuming fire,\"[fn-5-P520_229181:92-nf] and, \"I have come to send fire on the earth.\"[fn-5-P521_230625:93-nf] These two utterances of one God stamped on both Testaments, exhibit with harmonious testimony, the sanctification of the soul, pointing forward to the accomplishment of that which is also quoted in the New Testament from the Old: \"Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? Where. O death, is thy contest?\"[fn-5-P522_230972:94-nf] Could these heretics understand this one saying, no longer proud but quite reconciled, they would worship God nowhere but with thee and in thy bosom.

But godly confidence is not appalled by so ill-omened a circumstance; for the faithful bear in mind that assurance has been given that not a hair of their head shall perish, and that, therefore, though they even be devoured by beasts, their blessed resurrection will not hereby be hindered. The Truth would nowise have said, \"Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul,\"[fn-2-P274_76108:35-nf] if anything whatever that an enemy could do to the body of the slain could be detrimental to the future life. Or will some one perhaps take so absurd a position as to contend that those who kill the body are not to be feared before death, and lest they kill the body, but after death, lest they deprive it of burial? If this be so, then that is false which Christ says, \"Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do;\"[fn-2-P275_76586:36-nf] for it seems they can do great injury to the dead body. Far be it from us to suppose that the Truth can be thus false. They who kill the body are said \"to do something,\" because the deathblow is felt, the body still having sensation; but after that, they have no more that they can do, for in the slain body there is no sensation. And so there are indeed many bodies of Christians lying unburied; but no one has separated them from heaven, nor froth that earth which is all filled with the presence of Him who knows whence He will raise again what He created. It is said, indeed, in the Psalm: \"The dead bodies of Thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of Thy saints unto the beasts of the earth. Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them.\"[fn-2-P276_77438:37-nf] But this was said rather to exhibit the cruelty of those who did these things, than the misery of those who suffered them. To the eyes of men this appears a harsh and doleful lot, yet \"precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.\"[fn-2-P277_77709:38-nf] Wherefore all these last offices and ceremonies that concern the dead, the careful funeral arrangements, and the equipment of the tomb, and the pomp of obsequies, are rather the solace of the living than the comfort of the dead. If a costly burial does any good to a wicked man, a squalid burial, or none at all, may harm the godly. His crowd of domestics furnished the purple-clad Dives with a funeral gorgeous in the eye of man; but in the sight of God that was a more sumptuous funeral which the ulcerous pauper received at the hands of the angels, who did not carry him out to a marble tomb, but bore him aloft to Abraham's bosom.","title":"Book I","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":12,"verse":27,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_10_the_chaplet_or_de_corona_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"25","folder":"ANF-03","text":"If, for these and other such rules, you insist upon having positive Scripture injunction, you will find none. Tradition will be held forth to you as the originator of them, custom as their strengthener, and faith as their observer. That reason will support tradition, and custom, and faith, you will either yourself perceive, or learn from some one who has. Meanwhile you will believe that there is some reason to which submission is due. I add still one case more, as it will be proper to show you how it was among the ancients also. Among the Jews, so usual is it for their women to have the head veiled, that they may thereby be recognised. I ask in this instance for the law. I put the apostle aside. If Rebecca at once drew down her veil, when in the distance she saw her betrothed, this modesty of a mere private individual could not have made a law, or it will have made it only for those who have the reason which she had. Let virgins alone be veiled, and this when they are coming to be married, and not till they have recognised their destined husband. If Susanna also, who was subjected to unveiling on her trial,[fn-10-P1044_425796:12-nf] furnishes an argument for the veiling of women, I can say here also, the veil was a voluntary thing. She had come accused, ashamed of the disgrace she had brought on herself, properly concealing her beauty, even because now she feared to please. But I should not suppose that, when it was her aim to please, she took walks with a veil on in her husband's avenue. Grant, now, that she was always veiled. In this particular case, too, or, in fact, in that of any other, I demand the dress-law. If I nowhere find a law, it follows that tradition has given the fashion in question to custom, to find subsequently (its authorization in) the apostle's sanction, from the true interpretation of reason. This instances, therefore, will make it sufficiently plain that you can vindicate the keeping of even unwritten tradition established by custom; the proper witness for tradition when demonstrated by long-continued observance.[fn-10-P1045_426789:13-nf] But even in civil matters custom is accepted as law, when positive legal enactment is wanting; and it is the same thing whether it depends on writing or on reason, since reason is, in fact, the basis of law. But, (you say), if reason is the ground of law, all will now henceforth have to be counted law, whoever brings it forward, which shall have reason as its ground.[fn-10-P1046_427321:14-nf] Or do you think that every believer is entitled to originate and establish a law, if only it be such as is agreeable to God, as is helpful to discipline, as promotes salvation, when the Lord says, \"But why do you not even of your own selves judge what is right? \"[fn-10-P1047_427711:15-nf] And not merely in regard to a judicial sentence, but in regard to every decision in matters we are called on to consider, the apostle also says, \"If of anything you are ignorant, God shall reveal it unto you; \"[fn-10-P1048_427941:16-nf] he himself, too, being accustomed to afford counsel though he had not the command of the Lord, and to dictate of himself[fn-10-P1049_428082:17-nf] as possessing the Spirit of God who guides into all truth. Therefore his advice has, by the warrant of divine reason, become equivalent to nothing less than a divine command. Earnestly now inquire of this teacher,[fn-10-P1050_428346:18-nf] keeping intact your regard for tradition, from whomsoever it originally sprang; nor have regard to the author, but to the authority, and especially that of custom itself, which on this very account we should revere, that we may not want an interpreter; so that if reason too is God's gift, you may then learn, not whether custom has to be followed by you, but why.","title":"The Chaplet, or De Corona.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":12,"verse":48,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_07_book_i_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"109","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"63. Nor are we thus precluded from inflicting such punishment [requital][fn-5-P504_173053:185-nf] as avails for correction, and as compassion itself dictates; nor does it stand in the way of that course proposed, where one is prepared to endure more at thehand of him whom he wishes to set right. But no one is fit for inflicting this punishment except the man who, by the greatness of his love, has overcome that hatred wherewith those are wont to be inflamed who wish to avenge themselves. For it is not to be feared that parents would seem to hate a little son when, on committing an offence, he is beaten by them that he may not go on offending. And certainly the perfection of love is set before us by the imitation of God the Father Himself when it is said in what follows: \"Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them[fn-5-P505_173821:186-nf] which persecute you;\" and yet it is said of Him by the prophet, \"For whom the Lord loveth He correcteth; yea, He scourgeth every son whom He receiveth.\"[fn-5-P506_174040:187-nf] The Lord also says, \"The servant that knows not[fn-5-P507_174211:188-nf] his Lord's will, and does things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes; but the servant that knows his Lord's will, and does things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with many stripes.\"[fn-5-P508_174450:189-nf] No more, therefore, is sought for, except that he should punish to whom, in the natural order of things, the power is given; and that he should punish with the same goodwill which a father has towards his little son, whom by reason of his youth he cannot yet hate. For from this source the most suitable example is drawn, in order that it may be sufficiently manifest that sin can be punished in love rather than be left unpunished; so that one may wish him on whom he inflicts it not to be miserable by means of punishment, but to be happy by means of correction, yet be prepared, if need be, to endure with equanimity more injuries inflicted by him whom he wishes to be corrected, whether he may have the power of putting restraint upon him or not.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":12,"verse":48,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"271","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"9.

For how can we be made kin with God by one who is an alien? How can we be freed by one who is himself under the yoke of slavery? It follows that the mention of the Spirit and that of angels are not made under like conditions. The Spirit is called on as Lord of life, and the angels as allies of their fellow-slaves and faithful witnesses of the truth. It is customary for the saints to deliver the commandments of God in the presence of witnesses, as also the apostle himself says to Timothy, \"The things which thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men;\"[fn-14-P1469_359137:255-nf] and now he calls the angels to witness, for he knows that angels shall be present with the Lord when He shall come in the glory of His Father to judge the world in righteousness. For He says, \"Whoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God, but he that denieth Me before men shall be denied before the angels of God;\"[fn-14-P1470_359530:256-nf] and Paul in another place says,\" When the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his angels.\"[fn-14-P1471_359652:257-nf] Thus he already testifies before the angels, preparing good proofs for himself at the great tribunal.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":12,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":30,"source_paragraph":"186","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"71. Is answer to the objection that the doxology in the form \"with the Spirit\" has no written authority, we maintain that if there is no other instance of that which is unwritten, then this must not be received. But if the greater number of our mysteries are admitted into our constitution without written authority, then, in company with the many others, let us receive this one. For I hold it apostolic to abide also by the unwritten traditions. \"I praise you,\" it is said, \"that ye remember me in all things, andkeep the ordinances as I delivered them to you;\"[fn-19-P1907_510586:601-nf] and \"Hold fast the traditions which ye have been taught whether by word, or our Epistle.\"[fn-19-P1908_510738:602-nf] One of these traditions is the practice which is now before us, which they who ordained from the beginning, rooted firmly in the churches, delivering it to their successors, and its use through long custom advances pace by pace with time. If, as in a Court of Law, we were at a loss for documentary evidence, but were able to bring before you a large number of witnesses, would you not give your vote for our acquittal? I think so; for \"at the mouth of two or three witnesses shall the matter be established.\"[fn-19-P1909_511270:603-nf] And if we could prove clearly to you that a long period of time was in our favour, should we not have seemed to you to urge with reason that this suit ought not to be brought into court against us? For ancient dogmas inspire a certain sense of awe, venerable as they are with a hoary antiquity. I will therefore give you a list of the supporters of the word (and the time too must be taken into account in relation towhat passes unquestioned). For it did not originate with us. How could it? We, in comparison with the time during which this word has been in vogue, are, to use the words of Job, \"but of yesterday.\"[fn-19-P1910_511907:604-nf] I myself, if I must speak of what concerns me individually, cherish this phrase as a legacy left me by my fathers. It was delivered to me by one[fn-19-P1911_512076:605-nf] who spent a long life in the service of God, and by him I was both baptized, and admitted to the ministry of the church. While examining, so far as I could, if any of the blessed men of old used the words to which objection is now made, I found many worthy of credit both on account of their early date, and also a characteristic in which they are unlike the men of to-day-because of the exactness of their knowledge. Of these some coupled the word in the doxology by the preposition, others by the conjunction, but were in no case supposed to be acting divergently,-at least so far as the right sense of true religion is concerned.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":12,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_12_against_the_epistle_of_manichaeus_called_fundamental_","source_chapter":41,"source_paragraph":"138","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"45.

So far I have replied to the separate portions of his argument; I shall now address myself to the general question. Our Lord says to his disciples,[fn-68-P6892_2202528:265-nf] \"Whosoever would become great among you, let him be least of all.\" If we are all to be equal in heaven, in vain do we humble ourselves here that we may be greater there. Of the two debtors who owed, one five hundred pence, the other fifty, he to whom most was forgiven loved most. And so the Saviour says,[fn-68-P6893_2202858:266-nf] \"I say to you, her sins which are many are forgiven her, for she hath loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.\" He who loves little, and has little forgiven, he will of coarse be of inferior rank.[fn-68-P6894_2203106:267-nf] The householder when he set out delivered to his servants his goods, to one five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Just as in another Gospel it is written that a nobleman setting out for a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and return, called the servants, and gave them each a sum of money, with which one gained ten pounds, another five, and they, each according to his ability and the gain he had made, received ten or five cities. But one who had received a talent, or a pound, buried it in the ground, or tied it up in a napkin, and kept it until his master's return. Our first thought is that if, according to the modern Zeno, the righteous do not toil in hope of reward, but to avoid the loss of what they already have. he who buried his pound or talent that he might not lose it, did no wrong, and the caution of him who kept his money is worthy of more praise than the fruitless toil of those who wore themselves out and yet received no reward for their labour. Then observe that the very talent which was taken from the timid or negligent servant, was not l given to him who had the smaller profit, but to him who had gained the most, that is, to him who had been placed over ten cities. If difference of rank is not constituted by the difference in number, why did our Lord say, \"He gave to everyone according to his ability\"? If the gain of five talents and ten talents is the same, why were not ten cities given to him who gained the least, and five to him who gained the most?But that our Lord is not satisfied with what we have, but always desires more, He himself shows by saying, \"Wherefore didst thou not give my money to the money-changers, that so when I came I might have received it with usury?\" The Apostle Paul understood this, and[fn-68-P6895_2204942:268-nf] forgetting those things which were behind, reached forward to those things which were in front, that is, he made daily progress, and did not keep the grace given to him carefully wrapped up in a napkin, but his spirit, like the capital of a keen man of business, was renewed from day to day, and if he were not always growing larger, he thought himself growing less. Six cities of refuge are mentioned in the law, provided for fugitives who were involuntary homicides, and the cities themselves belonged to the priests. I should like to ask whether you would put those fugitives among your goats, or among our sheep.

And it will be plain to you that sheep indeed they are, but wandering sheep: that they are on the right hand, but do not stand there: they flee until the High Priest dies and descending into hell liberates their souls. The Gibeonites met the children of lsrael, and although other nations were slaughtered, they were kept[fn-68-P6896_2206140:269-nf] for hewers of wood and drawers of water.[fn-68-P6897_2206202:270-nf] And of such value were they in God's eyes, that the family of Saul was destroyed for the wrong done to them.

So far I have replied to the separate portions of his argument; I shall now address myself to the general question. Our Lord says to his disciples,[fn-68-P6892_2202528:265-nf] \"Whosoever would become great among you, let him be least of all.\" If we are all to be equal in heaven, in vain do we humble ourselves here that we may be greater there. Of the two debtors who owed, one five hundred pence, the other fifty, he to whom most was forgiven loved most. And so the Saviour says,[fn-68-P6893_2202858:266-nf] \"I say to you, her sins which are many are forgiven her, for she hath loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.\" He who loves little, and has little forgiven, he will of coarse be of inferior rank.[fn-68-P6894_2203106:267-nf] The householder when he set out delivered to his servants his goods, to one five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Just as in another Gospel it is written that a nobleman setting out for a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and return, called the servants, and gave them each a sum of money, with which one gained ten pounds, another five, and they, each according to his ability and the gain he had made, received ten or five cities. But one who had received a talent, or a pound, buried it in the ground, or tied it up in a napkin, and kept it until his master's return. Our first thought is that if, according to the modern Zeno, the righteous do not toil in hope of reward, but to avoid the loss of what they already have. he who buried his pound or talent that he might not lose it, did no wrong, and the caution of him who kept his money is worthy of more praise than the fruitless toil of those who wore themselves out and yet received no reward for their labour. Then observe that the very talent which was taken from the timid or negligent servant, was not l given to him who had the smaller profit, but to him who had gained the most, that is, to him who had been placed over ten cities. If difference of rank is not constituted by the difference in number, why did our Lord say, \"He gave to everyone according to his ability\"? If the gain of five talents and ten talents is the same, why were not ten cities given to him who gained the least, and five to him who gained the most?But that our Lord is not satisfied with what we have, but always desires more, He himself shows by saying, \"Wherefore didst thou not give my money to the money-changers, that so when I came I might have received it with usury?\" The Apostle Paul understood this, and[fn-68-P6895_2204942:268-nf] forgetting those things which were behind, reached forward to those things which were in front, that is, he made daily progress, and did not keep the grace given to him carefully wrapped up in a napkin, but his spirit, like the capital of a keen man of business, was renewed from day to day, and if he were not always growing larger, he thought himself growing less. Six cities of refuge are mentioned in the law, provided for fugitives who were involuntary homicides, and the cities themselves belonged to the priests. I should like to ask whether you would put those fugitives among your goats, or among our sheep. If they were goats, they would be slain like other homicides, and would not enter the cities of God's ministers. If you say they were sheep, they will not possibly be such sheep as can enjoy full liberty and feed without fear of wolves.

Once upon a thee even the Apostles[fn-69-P6964_2238064:25-nf] pleaded that the ointment was wasted, but they were rebuked by the voice of the Lord. Christ did not need the ointment, nor do martyrs need the light of tapers; and yet that woman poured out the ointment in honour of Christ, and her heart's devotion was accepted.

I do not deny, that all of us who believe in Christ have passed from the error of idolatry. For we are not born Christians, but become Christians by being born again.

But let us now speak of those things of which we think as known, and have in our knowledge even if we do not think of them; whether they belong to the contemplative knowledge, which, as I have argued, is properly to be called wisdom, or to the active which is properly to be called knowledge. For both together belong to one mind, and are one image of God. But when we treat of the lower of the two distinctly and separately, then it is not to be called an image of God, although even then, too, some likeness of that Trinity may be found in it; as we showed in the thirteenth book. We speak now, therefore, of the entire knowledge of man altogether, in which whatever is known to us is known; that, at any rate, which is true; otherwise it would not be known. For no one knows what is false, except when he knows it to be false; and if he knows this, then he knows what is true: for it is true that that is false. We treat, therefore, now of those things which we think as known, and which are known to us even if they are not being thought of But certainly, if we would utter them in words, we can only do so by thinking them.

But when the rich man refreshes[fn-6-P674_148561:4-nf] the poor, and assists him in his necessities, believing that what he does to the poor man will be able to find its reward with God-because the poor man is rich in intercession and confession, and his intercession has great power with God-then the rich man helps the poor in all things without hesitation; and the poor man, being helped by the rich, intercedes for him, giving thanks to God for him who bestows gifts upon him. And he still continues to interest himself zealously for the poor man, that his wants may be constantly supplied. For he knows that the intercession of the poor man is acceptable and influential[fn-6-P675_150196:5-nf] with God. Both, accordingly, accomplish their work. The poor man makes intercession; a work in which he is rich, which he received from the Lord, and with which he recompenses the master who helps him. And the rich man, in like manner, unhesitatingly bestows upon the poor man the riches which he received from the Lord. And this is a great work, and acceptable before God, because he understands the object of his wealth, and has given to the poor of the gifts of the Lord, and rightly discharged his service to Him.[fn-6-P676_150815:6-nf] Among men, however, the elm appears not to produce fruit, and they do not know nor understand that if a drought come, the elm, which contains water, nourishes the vine l and the vine, having an unfailing supply of water, yields double fruit both for itself and for the elm. So also poor men interceding with the Lord on behalf of the rich, increase their riches; and the rich, again, aiding the poor in their necessities, satisfy their souls. Both, therefore, are partners in the righteous work. He who does these things shall not be deserted by God, but shall be enrolled in the books of the living.

For it will not take place when we have seen; but we shall see when it has taken place. For he had already spoken of the new heavens and the new earth, speaking repeatedly, and under many figures, of the things promised to the saints, and saying,\"There shall be new heavens, and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind; but they shall find in it gladness and exultation. Behold, I will make Jerusalem an exultation, and my people a joy. And I will exult in Jerusalem, and joy in my people; and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her;\"[fn-39-P3957_2176778:105-nf] and other promises, which some endeavor to refer to carnal enjoyment during the thousand years. For, in the manner of prophecy, figurative and literal expressions are mingled, so that a serious mind may, by useful and salutary effort, reach the spiritual sense; but carnal sluggishness, or the slowness of an uneducated and undisciplined mind, rests in the superficial letter, and thinks there is nothing beneath to be looked for. But let this be enough regarding the style of those prophetic expressions just quoted. And now, to return to their interpretation. When he had said, \"And your bones shall rise up like a herb,\" in order to show that it was the resurrection of the good, though a bodily resurrection, to which he alluded, he added, \"And the hand of the Lord shall be known by His worshippers.\" What is this but the hand of Him who distinguishes those who worship from those who despise Him? Regarding these the context immediately adds, \"And He shall threaten the contumacious,\" or, as another translator has it, \"the unbelieving.\" He shall not actually threaten then, but the threats which are now uttered shall then be fulfilled in effect. \"For behold,\" he says, \"the Lord shall come as a fire, and as a whirlwind His chariots, to execute vengeance with indignation, and wasting with a flame of fire. For with fire of the Lord shall all the earth be judged, and all flesh with His sword: many shall be wounded by the Lord.\" By fire, whirlwind, sword, he means the judicial punishment of God. For he says that the Lord Himself shall come as a fire, to those, that is to say, to whom His coming shall be penal. By His chariots (for the word is plural)we suitably understand the ministration of angels. And when he says that all flesh and all the earth shall be judged with His fire and sword, we do not understand the spiritual and holy to be included, but the earthly and carnal, of whom it is said that they \"mind earthly things,\"[fn-39-P3958_2178747:106-nf] and \"to be carnally minded is death,\"[fn-39-P3959_2178807:107-nf] and whom the Lord calls simply flesh when He says, \"My Spirit shall not always remain in these men, for they are flesh.\"[fn-39-P3960_2178949:108-nf] As to the words, \"Many shall be wounded by the Lord,\" this wounding shall produce the second death. It is possible, indeed, to understand fire, sword, and wound in a good sense. For the Lord said that He wished to send fire on the earth.[fn-39-P3961_2179206:109-nf] And the cloven tongues appeared to them as fire when the Holy Spirit came.[fn-39-P3962_2179302:110-nf] And our Lord says, \"I am not come to send peace on earth, but a sword.\"[fn-39-P3963_2179393:111-nf] And Scripture says that the word of God is a doubly sharp sword,[fn-39-P3964_2179478:112-nf] on account of the two edges, the two Testaments. And in the Song of Songs the holy Church says that she is wounded with love,[fn-39-P3965_2179624:113-nf] -pierced, as it were, with the arrow of love. But here, where we read or hear that the Lord shall come to execute vengeance, it is obvious in what sense we are to understand these expressions.","title":"Book XX","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":12,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_21_lecture_xvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"25","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"20.

Besides, your Christ promises to the Jews their primitive condition, with the recovery of their country; and after this life's course is over, repose in Hades[fn-51-P5183_1626765:345-nf] in Abraham's bosom. Oh, most excellent God, when He restores in amnesty[fn-51-P5184_1626858:346-nf] what He took away in wrath! Oh, what a God is yours, who both wounds and heals, creates evil and makes peace! Oh, what a God, that is merciful even down to Hades! I shall have something to say about Abraham's bosom in the proper place.[fn-51-P5185_1627111:347-nf] As for the restoration of Judµa, however, which even the Jews themselves, induced by the names of places and countries, hope for just as it is described,[fn-51-P5186_1627305:348-nf] it would be tedious to state at length[fn-51-P5187_1627399:349-nf] how the figurative[fn-51-P5188_1627435:350-nf] interpretation is spiritually applicable to Christ and His church, and to the character and fruits thereof; besides, the subject has been regularly treated[fn-51-P5189_1627610:351-nf] in another work, which we entitle De Spe Fidelium.[fn-51-P5190_1627678:352-nf] At present, too, it would be superfluous[fn-51-P5191_1628057:353-nf] for this reason, that our inquiry relates to what is promised in heaven, not on earth. But we do confess that a kingdom is promised to us upon the earth, although before heaven, only in another state of existence; inasmuch as it will be after the resurrection for a thousand years in the divinely-built city of Jerusalem,[fn-51-P5192_1628394:354-nf] \"let down from heaven,\"[fn-51-P5193_1628465:355-nf] which the apostle also calls \"our mother from above; \"[fn-51-P5194_1628540:356-nf] and, while declaring that our poli/teuma, or citizenship, is in heaven,[fn-51-P5195_1628632:357-nf] he predicates of it[fn-51-P5196_1628699:358-nf] that it is really a city in heaven. This both Ezekiel had knowledge of[fn-51-P5197_1628786:359-nf] and the Apostle John beheld.[fn-51-P5198_1628843:360-nf] And the word of the new prophecy which is a part of our belief,[fn-51-P5199_1628931:361-nf] attests how it foretold that there would be for a sign a picture of this very city exhibited. to view previous to its manifestation. This prophecy, indeed, has been very lately fulfilled in an expedition to the East.[fn-52-P5200_1629283:362-nf] For it is evident from the testimony of even heathen witnesses, that in Judµa there was suspended in the sky a city early every morning for forty days. As the day advanced, the entire figure of its walls would wane gradually,[fn-52-P5201_1629622:363-nf] and sometimes it would vanish instantly.[fn-52-P5202_1629683:364-nf] We say that this city has been provided by God for receiving the saints on their resurrection, and refreshing them with the abundance of all really spiritual blessings, as a recompense for those which in the world we have either despised or lost; since it is both just and God-worthy that His servants should have their joy in the place where they have also suffered affliction for His name's sake. Of the heavenly kingdom this is the process.[fn-52-P5203_1630210:365-nf] After its thousand years are over, within which period is completed the resurrection of the saints, who rise sooner or later according to their deserts there will ensue the destruction of the world and the conflagration of all things at the judgment: we shall then be changed in a moment into the substance of angels, even by the investiture of an incorruptible nature, and so be removed to that kingdom in heaven of which we have now been treating, just as if it had not been predicted by the Creator, and as if it were proving Christ to belong to the other god and as if he were the first and sole revealer of it. But now learn that it has been, in fact, predicted by the Creator, and that even without prediction it has a claim upon our faith in respect of[fn-52-P5204_1630984:366-nf] the Creator. What appears to be probable to you, when Abraham's seed, after the primal promise of being like the sand of the sea for multitude, is destined likewise. to an equality with the stars of heaven-are not these the indications both of an earthly and a heavenly dispensation?[fn-52-P5205_1631313:367-nf] When Isaac, in blessing his son Jacob, says, \"God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth,\"[fn-52-P5206_1631448:368-nf] are there not in his words examples of both kinds of blessing? Indeed, the very form of the blessing is in this instance worthy of notice. For in relation to Jacob, who is the type of the later and more excellent people, that is to say ourselves,[fn-52-P5207_1631718:369-nf] first comes the promise of the heavenly dew, and afterwards that about the fatness of the earth. So are we first invited to heavenly blessings when we are separated from the world, and afterwards we thus find ourselves in the way of obtaining also earthly blessings. And your own gospel likewise has it in this wise: \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and these things shall be added unto you.\"[fn-52-P5208_1632177:370-nf] But to Esau the blessing promised is an earthly one, which he supplements with a heavenly, after the fatness of the earth, saying, \"Thy dwelling shall be also of the dew of heaven.\"[fn-52-P5209_1632380:371-nf] For the dispensation of the Jews (who were in Esau, the prior of the sons in birth, but the later in affection[fn-52-P5210_1632514:372-nf] ) at first was imbued with earthly blessings through the law, and afterwards brought round to heavenly ones through the gospel by faith. When Jacob sees in his dream the steps of a ladder set upon the earth, and reaching to heaven, with angels ascending and descending thereon, and the Lord standing above, we shall without hesitation venture to suppose,[fn-52-P5211_1633233:373-nf] that by this ladder the Lord has in judgment appointed that the way to heaven is shown to men, whereby some may attain to it, and others fall therefrom. For why, as soon as he awoke out of his sleep, and shook through a dread of the spot, does he fall to an interpretation of his dream? He exclaims, \"How terrible is this place!\" And then adds, \"This is none other than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven!\"[fn-52-P5212_1633692:374-nf] For he had seen Christ the Lord, the temple of God, and also the gate by whom heaven is entered. Now surely he would not have mentioned the gate of heaven, if heaven is not entered in the dispensation of the[fn-52-P5213_1633927:375-nf] Creator. But there is now a gate provided by Christ, which admits and conducts to glory. Of this Amos says: \"He buildeth His ascensions into heaven; \"[fn-52-P5214_1634091:376-nf] certainly not for Himself alone, but for His people also, who will be with Him. \"And Thou shall bind them about Thee,\" says he, \"like the adornment of a bride.\"[fn-52-P5215_1634272:377-nf] Accordingly the Spirit, admiring such as soar up to the celestial realms by these ascensions, says, \"They fly, as if they were kites; they fly as clouds, and as young doves, unto me\"[fn-52-P5216_1634477:378-nf] -that is, simply like a dove.[fn-52-P5217_1634526:379-nf] For we shall, according to the apostle, be caught up into the clouds to meet the Lord (even the Son of man, who shall come in the clouds, according to Daniel[fn-52-P5218_1634763:380-nf] ) and so shall we ever be with the Lord,[fn-52-P5219_1634824:381-nf] so long as He remains both on the earth and in heaven, who, against such as are thankless for both one promise and the other, calls the elements themselves to witness: \"Hear, O heaven, and give ear, O earth.\"[fn-52-P5220_1635058:382-nf] Now, for my own part indeed, even though Scripture held out no hand of heavenly hope to me (as, in fact, it so often does), I should still possess a sufficient presumption[fn-52-P5221_1635248:383-nf] of even this promise, in my present enjoyment of the earthly gift; and I should look out for something also of the heavenly, from Him who is the God of heaven as well as of earth. I should thus believe that the Christ who promises the higher blessings is (the Son) of Him who had also promised the lower ones; who had, moreover, afforded proofs of greater gifts by smaller ones; who had reserved for His Christ alone this revelation[fn-52-P5222_1635702:384-nf] of a (perhaps[fn-52-P5223_1635735:385-nf] ) unheard of kingdom, so that, while the earthly glory was announced by His servants, the heavenly might have God Himself for its messenger. You, however, argue for another Christ, from the very circumstance that He proclaims a new kingdom. You ought first to bring forward some example of His beneficence,[fn-52-P5224_1636059:386-nf] that I may have no good reason for doubting the credibility of the great promise, which you say ought to be hoped for; nay, it is before all things necessary that you should prove that a heaven belongs to Him, whom you declare to be a promiser of heavenly things. As it is, you invite us to dinner, but do not point out your house; you assert a kingdom, but show us no royal state.[fn-52-P5225_1636461:387-nf] Can it be that your Christ promises a kingdom of heaven, without having a heaven; as He displayed Himself man, without having flesh? O what a phantom from first to last![fn-52-P5226_1636677:388-nf] O hollow pretence of a mighty promise!

Wherefore, if the hair that has been cropped and the nails that have been cut would cause a deformity were they to be restored to their places, they shall not be restored; and yet no one will lose these parts at the resurrection, for they shall be changed into the same flesh, their substance being so altered as to preserve the proportion of the various parts of the body.

The Son hates those who refused obedience[fn-64-P6458_1904078:1138-nf] to the Father; nor does He wish His disciples to show such a disposition towards Him-not (let it be observed) towards another god, against whom such hypocrisy indeed might have been admissible, as that which He wished to guard His disciples against. It is the example of the Pharisees which He forbids. It was in respect of Him against whom the Pharisees were sinning that (Christ) now forbade His disciples to offend. Since, then, He had censured their hypocrisy, which covered the secrets of the heart, and obscured with superficial offices the mysteries of unbelief, because (while holding the key of knowledge) it would neither enter in itself, nor permit others to enter in, He therefore adds, \"There is nothing covered that shall not be revealed; neither hid, which shall not be known,\"[fn-64-P6459_1904892:1139-nf] in order that no one should suppose that He was attempting the revelation and the recognition of an hitherto unknown and hidden god. When He remarks also on their murmurs and taunts, in saying of Him, \"This man casteth out devils only through Beelzebub,\" He means that all these imputations would come forth to the light of day, and be in the mouths of men in consequence of the promulgation of the Gospel. He then turns to His disciples with these words, \"I say unto you, my friends, Be not afraid of them which can only kill the body, and after that have no more power over you.\"[fn-64-P6460_1905496:1140-nf] They will, however, find Isaiah had already said, \"See how the just man is taken away, and no man layeth it to heart.\"[fn-64-P6461_1905637:1141-nf] \"But I will show you whom ye shall fear: fear Him who, after He hath killed, hath power to cast into hell\" (meaning, of course, the Creator); \"yea, I say unto you, fear Him.\"[fn-64-P6462_1905836:1142-nf] Now, it would here be enough for my purpose that He forbids offence being given to Him whom He orders to be feared; and that He orders Him to be respected[fn-64-P6463_1906013:1143-nf] whom He forbids to be offended; and that He who gives these commands belongs to that very God for whom He procures this fear, this absence of offence, and this respect. But this conclusion I can draw also from the following words: \"For I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before God.\"[fn-64-P6464_1906360:1144-nf] Now they who shall confess Christ will have to be slain[fn-64-P6465_1906438:1145-nf] before men, but they will have nothing more to suffer after they have been put to death by them. These therefore will be they whom He forewarns above not to be afraid of being only killed; and this forewarning He offers, in order that He might subjoin a clause on the necessity of confessing Him: \"Every one that denieth me before men shall be denied before God\"[fn-64-P6466_1906827:1146-nf] -by Him, of course, who would have confessed him, if he had only confessed God. Now, He who will confess the confessor is the very same God who will also deny the denier of Himself. Again, if it is the confessor who will have nothing to fear after his violent death,[fn-64-P6467_1907116:1147-nf] it is the denier to whom everything will become fearful after his natural death. Since, therefore, that which will have to be feared after death, even the punishment of hell, belongs to the Creator, the denier, too, belongs to the Creator. As with the denier, however, so with the confessor: if he should deny God, he will plainly have to suffer from God, although from men he had nothing more to suffer after they had put him to death. And so Christ is the Creator's, because He shows that all those who deny Him ought to fear the Creator's hell. After deterring His disciples from denial of Himself, He adds an admonition to fear blasphemy: \"Whosoever shall speak against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him.\"[fn-64-P6468_1907939:1148-nf] Now, if both the remission and the retention of sin savour of a judicial God, the Holy Ghost, who is not to be blasphemed, will belong to Him, who will not forgive the, blasphemy; just as He who, in the preceding passage, was not to be denied, belonged to, Him who would, after He had killed, also cast into hell. Now, since it is Christ who averts blasphemy from the Creator, I am at a loss to know in what manner His adversary.[fn-64-P6469_1908392:1149-nf] could have come. Else, if by these sayings He throws a black cloud of censure[fn-64-P6470_1908532:1150-nf] over the severity of Him who will not forgive blasphemy and will kill even to hell, it follows that the very spirit of that rival god may be blasphemed with impunity, and his Christ denied; and that there is no difference, in fact, between worshipping and despising him; but that, as there is no punishment for the contempt, so there is no reward for the worship, which men need expect. When \"brought before magistrates,\" and examined, He forbids them \"to take thought how they shall answer; \"\"for,\" says He, \"the Holy Ghost shall teach you in that very hour what ye ought to say.\"[fn-64-P6471_1909133:1151-nf] If such an injunction[fn-64-P6472_1909182:1152-nf] as this comes from the Creator, the precept will only be His by whom an example was previously given. The prophet Balaam, in Numbers, when sent forth by king Balak to curse lsrµl, with whom he was commencing war, was at the same moment[fn-64-P6473_1909439:1153-nf] filled with the Spirit. Instead of the curse which he was come to pronounce, he uttered the blessing which the Spirit at that very hour inspired him with; having previously declared to the king's messengers, and then to the king himself, that he could only speak forth that which God should put into his mouth.[fn-64-P6474_1909766:1154-nf] The novel doctrines of the new Christ are such as the Creator's servants initiated long before!

Well, then, my Moses is better than your Christ, aiming as he did at the peace of brethren, and obviating their wrong.

The Son hates those who refused obedience[fn-64-P6458_1904078:1138-nf] to the Father; nor does He wish His disciples to show such a disposition towards Him-not (let it be observed) towards another god, against whom such hypocrisy indeed might have been admissible, as that which He wished to guard His disciples against. It is the example of the Pharisees which He forbids. It was in respect of Him against whom the Pharisees were sinning that (Christ) now forbade His disciples to offend. Since, then, He had censured their hypocrisy, which covered the secrets of the heart, and obscured with superficial offices the mysteries of unbelief, because (while holding the key of knowledge) it would neither enter in itself, nor permit others to enter in, He therefore adds, \"There is nothing covered that shall not be revealed; neither hid, which shall not be known,\"[fn-64-P6459_1904892:1139-nf] in order that no one should suppose that He was attempting the revelation and the recognition of an hitherto unknown and hidden god.

He then turns to His disciples with these words, \"I say unto you, my friends, Be not afraid of them which can only kill the body, and after that have no more power over you.\"[fn-64-P6460_1905496:1140-nf] They will, however, find Isaiah had already said, \"See how the just man is taken away, and no man layeth it to heart.\"[fn-64-P6461_1905637:1141-nf] \"But I will show you whom ye shall fear: fear Him who, after He hath killed, hath power to cast into hell\" (meaning, of course, the Creator); \"yea, I say unto you, fear Him.\"[fn-64-P6462_1905836:1142-nf] Now, it would here be enough for my purpose that He forbids offence being given to Him whom He orders to be feared; and that He orders Him to be respected[fn-64-P6463_1906013:1143-nf] whom He forbids to be offended; and that He who gives these commands belongs to that very God for whom He procures this fear, this absence of offence, and this respect. But this conclusion I can draw also from the following words: \"For I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before God.\"[fn-64-P6464_1906360:1144-nf] Now they who shall confess Christ will have to be slain[fn-64-P6465_1906438:1145-nf] before men, but they will have nothing more to suffer after they have been put to death by them. These therefore will be they whom He forewarns above not to be afraid of being only killed; and this forewarning He offers, in order that He might subjoin a clause on the necessity of confessing Him: \"Every one that denieth me before men shall be denied before God\"[fn-64-P6466_1906827:1146-nf] -by Him, of course, who would have confessed him, if he had only confessed God.

Since, therefore, that which will have to be feared after death, even the punishment of hell, belongs to the Creator, the denier, too, belongs to the Creator. As with the denier, however, so with the confessor: if he should deny God, he will plainly have to suffer from God, although from men he had nothing more to suffer after they had put him to death. And so Christ is the Creator's, because He shows that all those who deny Him ought to fear the Creator's hell. After deterring His disciples from denial of Himself, He adds an admonition to fear blasphemy: \"Whosoever shall speak against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him.\"[fn-64-P6468_1907939:1148-nf] Now, if both the remission and the retention of sin savour of a judicial God, the Holy Ghost, who is not to be blasphemed, will belong to Him, who will not forgive the, blasphemy; just as He who, in the preceding passage, was not to be denied, belonged to, Him who would, after He had killed, also cast into hell. Now, since it is Christ who averts blasphemy from the Creator, I am at a loss to know in what manner His adversary.[fn-64-P6469_1908392:1149-nf] could have come. Else, if by these sayings He throws a black cloud of censure[fn-64-P6470_1908532:1150-nf] over the severity of Him who will not forgive blasphemy and will kill even to hell, it follows that the very spirit of that rival god may be blasphemed with impunity, and his Christ denied; and that there is no difference, in fact, between worshipping and despising him; but that, as there is no punishment for the contempt, so there is no reward for the worship, which men need expect. When \"brought before magistrates,\" and examined, He forbids them \"to take thought how they shall answer; \"\"for,\" says He, \"the Holy Ghost shall teach you in that very hour what ye ought to say.\"[fn-64-P6471_1909133:1151-nf] If such an injunction[fn-64-P6472_1909182:1152-nf] as this comes from the Creator, the precept will only be His by whom an example was previously given. The prophet Balaam, in Numbers, when sent forth by king Balak to curse lsrµl, with whom he was commencing war, was at the same moment[fn-64-P6473_1909439:1153-nf] filled with the Spirit.

The Son hates those who refused obedience[fn-64-P6458_1904078:1138-nf] to the Father; nor does He wish His disciples to show such a disposition towards Him-not (let it be observed) towards another god, against whom such hypocrisy indeed might have been admissible, as that which He wished to guard His disciples against. It is the example of the Pharisees which He forbids. It was in respect of Him against whom the Pharisees were sinning that (Christ) now forbade His disciples to offend. Since, then, He had censured their hypocrisy, which covered the secrets of the heart, and obscured with superficial offices the mysteries of unbelief, because (while holding the key of knowledge) it would neither enter in itself, nor permit others to enter in, He therefore adds, \"There is nothing covered that shall not be revealed; neither hid, which shall not be known,\"[fn-64-P6459_1904892:1139-nf] in order that no one should suppose that He was attempting the revelation and the recognition of an hitherto unknown and hidden god.

He then turns to His disciples with these words, \"I say unto you, my friends, Be not afraid of them which can only kill the body, and after that have no more power over you.\"[fn-64-P6460_1905496:1140-nf] They will, however, find Isaiah had already said, \"See how the just man is taken away, and no man layeth it to heart.\"[fn-64-P6461_1905637:1141-nf] \"But I will show you whom ye shall fear: fear Him who, after He hath killed, hath power to cast into hell\" (meaning, of course, the Creator); \"yea, I say unto you, fear Him.\"[fn-64-P6462_1905836:1142-nf] Now, it would here be enough for my purpose that He forbids offence being given to Him whom He orders to be feared; and that He orders Him to be respected[fn-64-P6463_1906013:1143-nf] whom He forbids to be offended; and that He who gives these commands belongs to that very God for whom He procures this fear, this absence of offence, and this respect. But this conclusion I can draw also from the following words: \"For I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before God.\"[fn-64-P6464_1906360:1144-nf] Now they who shall confess Christ will have to be slain[fn-64-P6465_1906438:1145-nf] before men, but they will have nothing more to suffer after they have been put to death by them. These therefore will be they whom He forewarns above not to be afraid of being only killed; and this forewarning He offers, in order that He might subjoin a clause on the necessity of confessing Him: \"Every one that denieth me before men shall be denied before God\"[fn-64-P6466_1906827:1146-nf] -by Him, of course, who would have confessed him, if he had only confessed God.

Again, if it is the confessor who will have nothing to fear after his violent death,[fn-64-P6467_1907116:1147-nf] it is the denier to whom everything will become fearful after his natural death. Since, therefore, that which will have to be feared after death, even the punishment of hell, belongs to the Creator, the denier, too, belongs to the Creator. As with the denier, however, so with the confessor: if he should deny God, he will plainly have to suffer from God, although from men he had nothing more to suffer after they had put him to death. And so Christ is the Creator's, because He shows that all those who deny Him ought to fear the Creator's hell. After deterring His disciples from denial of Himself, He adds an admonition to fear blasphemy: \"Whosoever shall speak against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him.\"[fn-64-P6468_1907939:1148-nf] Now, if both the remission and the retention of sin savour of a judicial God, the Holy Ghost, who is not to be blasphemed, will belong to Him, who will not forgive the, blasphemy; just as He who, in the preceding passage, was not to be denied, belonged to, Him who would, after He had killed, also cast into hell. Now, since it is Christ who averts blasphemy from the Creator, I am at a loss to know in what manner His adversary.[fn-64-P6469_1908392:1149-nf] could have come. Else, if by these sayings He throws a black cloud of censure[fn-64-P6470_1908532:1150-nf] over the severity of Him who will not forgive blasphemy and will kill even to hell, it follows that the very spirit of that rival god may be blasphemed with impunity, and his Christ denied; and that there is no difference, in fact, between worshipping and despising him; but that, as there is no punishment for the contempt, so there is no reward for the worship, which men need expect. When \"brought before magistrates,\" and examined, He forbids them \"to take thought how they shall answer; \"\"for,\" says He, \"the Holy Ghost shall teach you in that very hour what ye ought to say.\"[fn-64-P6471_1909133:1151-nf] If such an injunction[fn-64-P6472_1909182:1152-nf] as this comes from the Creator, the precept will only be His by whom an example was previously given. The prophet Balaam, in Numbers, when sent forth by king Balak to curse lsrµl, with whom he was commencing war, was at the same moment[fn-64-P6473_1909439:1153-nf] filled with the Spirit.

For He had Himself been present in Moses, who heard such a rejection-even He, the Spirit of the Creator.[fn-64-P6482_1911549:1162-nf] I think that we have already, in another passage,[fn-64-P6483_1911778:1163-nf] sufficiently shown that the glory of riches is condemned by our God, \"who putteth down the mighty from their throne, and exalts the poor from the dunghill.\"[fn-64-P6484_1911990:1164-nf] From Him, therefore, will proceed the parable of the rich man, who flattered himself about the increase of his fields, and to Whom God said: \"Thou fool, this night shall they require thy soul of thee; then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided? \"[fn-64-P6485_1912314:1165-nf] It was just in the like manner that the king Hezekiah heard from Isaiah the sad doom of his kingdom, when he gloried, before the envoys of Babylon,[fn-64-P6486_1912488:1166-nf] in his treasures and the deposits of his precious things.[fn-64-P6487_1912568:1167-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":12,"verse":22,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":31,"source_paragraph":"108","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Who would be unwilling that we should distress ourselves[fn-64-P6491_1912961:1168-nf] about sustenance for our life, or clothing for our body,[fn-64-P6492_1913059:1169-nf] but He who has provided these things already for man; and who, therefore, while distributing them to us, prohibits all anxiety respecting them as an outrage[fn-64-P6493_1913242:1170-nf] against his liberality?-who has adapted the nature of \"life\" itself to a condition \"better than meat,\" and has fashioned the material of \"the body,\" so as to make it \"more than raiment; \"whose \"ravens, too, neither sow nor reap, nor gather into storehouses, and are yet fed\" by Himself; whose \"lilies and grass also toil not, nor spin, and yet are clothed\" by Him; whose \"Solomon, moreover, was transcendent in glory, and yet was not arrayed like\" the humble flower.[fn-64-P6494_1913727:1171-nf] Besides, nothing can be more abrupt than that one God should be distributing His bounty, while the other should bid us take no thought about (so kindly a) distribution-and that, too, with the intention of derogating (from his liberality). Whether, indeed, it is as depreciating the Creator that he does not wish such trifles to be thought of, concerning which neither the crows nor the lilies labour, because, forsooth, they come spontaneously to hand[fn-64-P6495_1914219:1172-nf] by reason of their very worthlessness,[fn-64-P6496_1914284:1173-nf] will appear a little further on. Meanwhile, how is it that He chides them as being \"of little faith? \"[fn-64-P6497_1914414:1174-nf] What faith? Does He mean that faith which they were as yet unable to manifest perfectly in a god who has hardly yet revealed,[fn-64-P6498_1914563:1175-nf] and whom they were in process of learning as well as they could; or that faith which they for this express reason owed to the Creator, because they believed that He was of His own will supplying these wants of the human race, and therefore took no thought about them? Now, when He adds, \"For all these things do the nations of the world seek after,\"[fn-64-P6499_1914944:1176-nf] even by their not believing in God as the Creator and Giver of all things, since He was unwilling that they should be like these nations, He therefore upbraided them as being defective of faith in the same God, in whom He remarked that the Gentiles were quite wanting in faith. When He further adds, \"But your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things,\"[fn-65-P6500_1915328:1177-nf] I would first ask, what Father Christ would have to be here understood? If He points to their own Creator, He also affirms Him to be good, who knows what His children have need of; but if He refers to that other god, how does he know that food and raiment are necessary to man, seeing that he has made no such provision for him? For if he had known the want, he would have made the provision. If, however, he knows what things man has need of, and yet has failed to supply them, he is in the failure guilty of either malignity or weakness. But when he confessed that these things are necessary to man, he really affirmed that they are good. For nothing that is evil is necessary. So that he will not be any longer a depreciator of the works and the indulgences of the Creator, that I may here complete the answer[fn-65-P6501_1916165:1178-nf] which I deferred giving above. Again, if it is another god who has foreseen man's wants, and is supplying them, how is it that Marcion's Christ himself promises them?[fn-65-P6502_1916353:1179-nf] Is he liberal with another's property?[fn-65-P6503_1916415:1180-nf] \"Seek ye,\" says he, \"the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you\"-by himself, of course. But if by himself, what sort of being is he, who shall bestow the things of another? If by the Creator, whose all things are, then who[fn-65-P6504_1916686:1181-nf] is he that promises what belongs to another? If these things are \"additions\" to the kingdom, they must be placed in the second rank;[fn-65-P6505_1916836:1182-nf] and the second rank belongs to Him to whom the first also does; His are the food and raiment, whose is the kingdom. Thus to the Creator belongs the entire promise, the full reality[fn-65-P6506_1917041:1183-nf] of its parables, the perfect equalization[fn-65-P6507_1917100:1184-nf] of its similitudes; for these have respect to none other than Him to whom they have a parity of relation in every point.[fn-65-P6508_1917243:1185-nf] We are servants because we have a Lord in our God. We ought \"to have our loins girded: \"[fn-65-P6509_1917368:1186-nf] in other words, we are to be free from the embarrassments of a perplexed and much occupied life; \"to have our lights burning,\"[fn-65-P6510_1917518:1187-nf] that is, our minds kindled by faith, and resplendent with the works of truth. And thus \"to wait for our Lord,\"[fn-65-P6511_1917652:1188-nf] that is, Christ. Whence \"returning? \"If \"from the wedding,\" He is the Christ of the Creator, for the wedding is His. If He is not the Creator's, not even Marcion himself would have gone to the wedding, although invited, for in his god he discovers one who hates the nuptial bed. The parable would therefore have failed in the person of the Lord, if He were not a Being to whom a wedding is consistent. In the next parable also he makes a flagrant mistake, when he assigns to the person of the Creator that \"thief, whose hour, if the father of the family had only known, he would not have suffered his house to be broken through.\"[fn-65-P6512_1918305:1189-nf] How can the Creator wear in any way the aspect of a thief, Lord as He is of all mankind? No one pilfers or plunders his own property, but he[fn-65-P6513_1918469:1190-nf] rather acts the part of one who swoops down on the things of another, and alienates man from his Lord.[fn-65-P6514_1918598:1191-nf] Again, when He indicates to us that the devil is \"the thief,\" whose hour at the very beginning of the world, if man had known, he would never have been broken in upon[fn-65-P6515_1918805:1192-nf] by him, He warns us \"to be ready,\" for this reason, because \"we know not the hour when the Son of man shall come\"[fn-65-P6516_1918939:1193-nf] -not as if He were Himself the thief, but rather as being the judge of those who prepared not themselves, and used no precaution against the thief. Since, then, He is the Son of man, I hold Him to be the Judge, and in the Judge I claim[fn-65-P6517_1919197:1194-nf] the Creator. If then in this passage he displays the Creator's Christ under the title \"Son of man,\" that he may give us some presage[fn-65-P6518_1919348:1195-nf] of the thief, of the period of whose coming we are ignorant, you still have it ruled above, that no one is the thief of his own property; besides which, there is our principle also unimpaired[fn-65-P6519_1919560:1196-nf] -that in as far as He insists on the Creator as an object of fear, in so far does He belong to the Creator, and does the Creator's work. When, therefore, Peter asked whether He had spoken the parable \"unto them, or even to all,\"[fn-65-P6520_1919805:1197-nf] He sets forth for them, and for all who should bear rule in the churches, the similitude of stewards.[fn-65-P6521_1919930:1198-nf] That steward who should treat his fellow-servants well in his Lord's absence, would on his return be set as ruler over all his property; but he who should act otherwise should be severed, and have his portion with the unbelievers, when his lord should return on the day when he looked not for him, at the hour when he was not aware[fn-65-P6522_1920280:1199-nf] -even that Son of man, the Creator's Christ, not a thief, but a Judge. He accordingly, in this passage, either presents to us the Lord as a Judge, and instructs us in His character,[fn-65-P6523_1920488:1200-nf] or else as the simply good god; if the latter, he now also affirms his judicial attribute, although the heretic refuses to admit it. For an attempt is made to modify this sense when it is applied to his god,-as if it were an act of serenity and mildness simply to sever the man off, and to assign him a portion with the unbelievers, under the idea that he was not summoned (before the judge), but only returned to his own state! As if this very process did not imply a judicial act! What folly! What will be the end of i the severed ones? Will it not be the forfeiture of salvation, since their separation will be from those who shall attain salvation? What, again, will be the condition of the unbelievers? Will it not be damnation? Else, if these severed and unfaithful ones shall have nothing to suffer, there will, on the other hand, be nothing for the accepted and the believers to obtain. If, however, the accepted and the believers shall attain salvation, it must needs be that the rejected and the unbelieving should incur the opposite issue, even the loss of salvation. Now here is a judgment, and He who holds it out before us belongs to the Creator. Whom else than the God of retribution can I understand by Him who shall \"beat His servants with stripes,\" either \"few or many,\" and shall exact from them what He had committed to them? Whom is it suitable[fn-65-P6524_1921881:1201-nf] for me to obey, but Him who remunerates? Your Christ proclaims, \"I am come to send fire on the earth.\"[fn-65-P6525_1922000:1202-nf] That[fn-65-P6526_1922028:1203-nf] most lenient being, the lord who has no hell, not long before had restrained his disciples from demanding fire on the churlish village. Whereas He[fn-65-P6527_1922208:1204-nf] burnt up Sodom and Gomorrah with a tempest of fire. Of Him the psalmist sang, \"A fire shall go out before Him, and burn up His enemies round about.\"[fn-65-P6528_1922385:1205-nf] By Hoses He uttered the threat, \"I will send a fire upon the cities of Judah; \"[fn-65-P6529_1922488:1206-nf] and[fn-65-P6530_1922516:1207-nf] by Isaiah, \"A fire has been kindled in mine anger.\" He cannot lie. If it is not He who uttered His voice out of even the burning bush, it can be of no importance[fn-65-P6531_1922854:1208-nf] what fire you insist upon being understood. Even if it be but figurative fire, yet, from the very fact that he takes from my element illustrations for His own sense, He is mine, because He uses what is mine. The similitude of fire must belong to Him who owns the reality thereof. But He will Himself best explain the quality of that fire which He mentioned, when He goes on to say, \"Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division.\"[fn-65-P6532_1923344:1209-nf] It is written \"a sword,\"[fn-65-P6533_1923392:1210-nf] but Marcion makes an emendation[fn-65-P6534_1923880:1211-nf] of the word, just as if a division were not the work of the sword. He, therefore, who refused to give peace, intended also the fire of destruction. As is the combat, so is the burning. As is the sword, so is the flame. Neither is suitable for its lord. He says at last, \"The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother-in-law against the daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law.\"[fn-65-P6535_1924476:1212-nf] Since this battle among the relatives[fn-65-P6536_1924537:1213-nf] was sung by the prophet's trumpet in the very words, I fear that Micah[fn-65-P6537_1924627:1214-nf] must have predicted it to Marcion's Christ! On this account He pronounced them \"hypocrites,\" because they could \"discern the face of the sky and the earth, but could not distinguish this time,\"[fn-65-P6538_1924843:1215-nf] when of course He ought to have been recognised, fulfilling (as he was) all things which had been predicted concerning them, and teaching them so. But then who could know the times of him of whom he had no evidence to prove his existence? Justly also does He upbraid them for \"not even of themselves judging what is right.\"[fn-65-P6539_1925190:1216-nf] Of old does He command by Zechariah, \"Execute the judgment of truth and peace; \"[fn-65-P6540_1925294:1217-nf] by Jeremiah, \"Execute judgment and righteousness; \"[fn-65-P6541_1925371:1218-nf] by Isaiah, \"Judge the fatherless, plead for the widow,\"[fn-65-P6542_1925450:1219-nf] charging it as a fault upon the vine of Sorech,[fn-65-P6543_1925519:1220-nf] that when \"He looked for righteousness therefrom, there was only a cry\"[fn-65-P6544_1925983:1221-nf] (of oppression). The same God who had taught them to act as He commanded them,[fn-65-P6545_1926082:1222-nf] was now requiring that they should act of their own accord.[fn-65-P6546_1926166:1223-nf] He who had sown the precept, was now pressing to an abundant harvest from it. But how absurd, that he should now be commanding them to judge righteously, who was destroying God the righteous Judge! For the Judge, who commits to prison, and allows no release Out of it without the payment of \"the very last mite,\"[fn-65-P6547_1926501:1224-nf] they treat of in the person of the Creator, with the view of disparaging Him. Which cavil, however, I deem it necessary to meet with the same answer.[fn-65-P6548_1926677:1225-nf] For as often as the Creator's severity is paraded before us, so often is Christ (shown to be) His, to whom He urges submission by the motive of fear.

Meanwhile, how is it that He chides them as being \"of little faith? \"[fn-64-P6497_1914414:1174-nf] What faith?

Now, when He adds, \"For all these things do the nations of the world seek after,\"[fn-64-P6499_1914944:1176-nf] even by their not believing in God as the Creator and Giver of all things, since He was unwilling that they should be like these nations, He therefore upbraided them as being defective of faith in the same God, in whom He remarked that the Gentiles were quite wanting in faith. When He further adds, \"But your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things,\"[fn-65-P6500_1915328:1177-nf] I would first ask, what Father Christ would have to be here understood? If He points to their own Creator, He also affirms Him to be good, who knows what His children have need of; but if He refers to that other god, how does he know that food and raiment are necessary to man, seeing that he has made no such provision for him? For if he had known the want, he would have made the provision. If, however, he knows what things man has need of, and yet has failed to supply them, he is in the failure guilty of either malignity or weakness. But when he confessed that these things are necessary to man, he really affirmed that they are good. For nothing that is evil is necessary. So that he will not be any longer a depreciator of the works and the indulgences of the Creator, that I may here complete the answer[fn-65-P6501_1916165:1178-nf] which I deferred giving above. Again, if it is another god who has foreseen man's wants, and is supplying them, how is it that Marcion's Christ himself promises them?[fn-65-P6502_1916353:1179-nf] Is he liberal with another's property?[fn-65-P6503_1916415:1180-nf] \"Seek ye,\" says he, \"the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you\"-by himself, of course. But if by himself, what sort of being is he, who shall bestow the things of another? If by the Creator, whose all things are, then who[fn-65-P6504_1916686:1181-nf] is he that promises what belongs to another? If these things are \"additions\" to the kingdom, they must be placed in the second rank;[fn-65-P6505_1916836:1182-nf] and the second rank belongs to Him to whom the first also does; His are the food and raiment, whose is the kingdom. Thus to the Creator belongs the entire promise, the full reality[fn-65-P6506_1917041:1183-nf] of its parables, the perfect equalization[fn-65-P6507_1917100:1184-nf] of its similitudes; for these have respect to none other than Him to whom they have a parity of relation in every point.[fn-65-P6508_1917243:1185-nf] We are servants because we have a Lord in our God.

The parable would therefore have failed in the person of the Lord, if He were not a Being to whom a wedding is consistent. In the next parable also he makes a flagrant mistake, when he assigns to the person of the Creator that \"thief, whose hour, if the father of the family had only known, he would not have suffered his house to be broken through.\"[fn-65-P6512_1918305:1189-nf] How can the Creator wear in any way the aspect of a thief, Lord as He is of all mankind? No one pilfers or plunders his own property, but he[fn-65-P6513_1918469:1190-nf] rather acts the part of one who swoops down on the things of another, and alienates man from his Lord.[fn-65-P6514_1918598:1191-nf] Again, when He indicates to us that the devil is \"the thief,\" whose hour at the very beginning of the world, if man had known, he would never have been broken in upon[fn-65-P6515_1918805:1192-nf] by him, He warns us \"to be ready,\" for this reason, because \"we know not the hour when the Son of man shall come\"[fn-65-P6516_1918939:1193-nf] -not as if He were Himself the thief, but rather as being the judge of those who prepared not themselves, and used no precaution against the thief. Since, then, He is the Son of man, I hold Him to be the Judge, and in the Judge I claim[fn-65-P6517_1919197:1194-nf] the Creator. If then in this passage he displays the Creator's Christ under the title \"Son of man,\" that he may give us some presage[fn-65-P6518_1919348:1195-nf] of the thief, of the period of whose coming we are ignorant, you still have it ruled above, that no one is the thief of his own property; besides which, there is our principle also unimpaired[fn-65-P6519_1919560:1196-nf] -that in as far as He insists on the Creator as an object of fear, in so far does He belong to the Creator, and does the Creator's work. When, therefore, Peter asked whether He had spoken the parable \"unto them, or even to all,\"[fn-65-P6520_1919805:1197-nf] He sets forth for them, and for all who should bear rule in the churches, the similitude of stewards.[fn-65-P6521_1919930:1198-nf] That steward who should treat his fellow-servants well in his Lord's absence, would on his return be set as ruler over all his property; but he who should act otherwise should be severed, and have his portion with the unbelievers, when his lord should return on the day when he looked not for him, at the hour when he was not aware[fn-65-P6522_1920280:1199-nf] -even that Son of man, the Creator's Christ, not a thief, but a Judge. He accordingly, in this passage, either presents to us the Lord as a Judge, and instructs us in His character,[fn-65-P6523_1920488:1200-nf] or else as the simply good god; if the latter, he now also affirms his judicial attribute, although the heretic refuses to admit it. For an attempt is made to modify this sense when it is applied to his god,-as if it were an act of serenity and mildness simply to sever the man off, and to assign him a portion with the unbelievers, under the idea that he was not summoned (before the judge), but only returned to his own state! As if this very process did not imply a judicial act! What folly! What will be the end of i the severed ones? Will it not be the forfeiture of salvation, since their separation will be from those who shall attain salvation? What, again, will be the condition of the unbelievers? Will it not be damnation? Else, if these severed and unfaithful ones shall have nothing to suffer, there will, on the other hand, be nothing for the accepted and the believers to obtain. If, however, the accepted and the believers shall attain salvation, it must needs be that the rejected and the unbelieving should incur the opposite issue, even the loss of salvation. Now here is a judgment, and He who holds it out before us belongs to the Creator. Whom else than the God of retribution can I understand by Him who shall \"beat His servants with stripes,\" either \"few or many,\" and shall exact from them what He had committed to them? Whom is it suitable[fn-65-P6524_1921881:1201-nf] for me to obey, but Him who remunerates?

Whereas He[fn-65-P6527_1922208:1204-nf] burnt up Sodom and Gomorrah with a tempest of fire. Of Him the psalmist sang, \"A fire shall go out before Him, and burn up His enemies round about.\"[fn-65-P6528_1922385:1205-nf] By Hoses He uttered the threat, \"I will send a fire upon the cities of Judah; \"[fn-65-P6529_1922488:1206-nf] and[fn-65-P6530_1922516:1207-nf] by Isaiah, \"A fire has been kindled in mine anger.\" He cannot lie. If it is not He who uttered His voice out of even the burning bush, it can be of no importance[fn-65-P6531_1922854:1208-nf] what fire you insist upon being understood. Even if it be but figurative fire, yet, from the very fact that he takes from my element illustrations for His own sense, He is mine, because He uses what is mine. The similitude of fire must belong to Him who owns the reality thereof.

If, however, the accepted and the believers shall attain salvation, it must needs be that the rejected and the unbelieving should incur the opposite issue, even the loss of salvation. Now here is a judgment, and He who holds it out before us belongs to the Creator. Whom else than the God of retribution can I understand by Him who shall \"beat His servants with stripes,\" either \"few or many,\" and shall exact from them what He had committed to them?

Whereas He[fn-65-P6527_1922208:1204-nf] burnt up Sodom and Gomorrah with a tempest of fire. Of Him the psalmist sang, \"A fire shall go out before Him, and burn up His enemies round about.\"[fn-65-P6528_1922385:1205-nf] By Hoses He uttered the threat, \"I will send a fire upon the cities of Judah; \"[fn-65-P6529_1922488:1206-nf] and[fn-65-P6530_1922516:1207-nf] by Isaiah, \"A fire has been kindled in mine anger.\" He cannot lie. If it is not He who uttered His voice out of even the burning bush, it can be of no importance[fn-65-P6531_1922854:1208-nf] what fire you insist upon being understood. Even if it be but figurative fire, yet, from the very fact that he takes from my element illustrations for His own sense, He is mine, because He uses what is mine. The similitude of fire must belong to Him who owns the reality thereof. But He will Himself best explain the quality of that fire which He mentioned, when He goes on to say, \"Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division.\"[fn-65-P6532_1923344:1209-nf] It is written \"a sword,\"[fn-65-P6533_1923392:1210-nf] but Marcion makes an emendation[fn-65-P6534_1923880:1211-nf] of the word, just as if a division were not the work of the sword. He, therefore, who refused to give peace, intended also the fire of destruction. As is the combat, so is the burning. As is the sword, so is the flame. Neither is suitable for its lord. He says at last, \"The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother-in-law against the daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law.\"[fn-65-P6535_1924476:1212-nf] Since this battle among the relatives[fn-65-P6536_1924537:1213-nf] was sung by the prophet's trumpet in the very words, I fear that Micah[fn-65-P6537_1924627:1214-nf] must have predicted it to Marcion's Christ! On this account He pronounced them \"hypocrites,\" because they could \"discern the face of the sky and the earth, but could not distinguish this time,\"[fn-65-P6538_1924843:1215-nf] when of course He ought to have been recognised, fulfilling (as he was) all things which had been predicted concerning them, and teaching them so.

Justly also does He upbraid them for \"not even of themselves judging what is right.\"[fn-65-P6539_1925190:1216-nf] Of old does He command by Zechariah, \"Execute the judgment of truth and peace; \"[fn-65-P6540_1925294:1217-nf] by Jeremiah, \"Execute judgment and righteousness; \"[fn-65-P6541_1925371:1218-nf] by Isaiah, \"Judge the fatherless, plead for the widow,\"[fn-65-P6542_1925450:1219-nf] charging it as a fault upon the vine of Sorech,[fn-65-P6543_1925519:1220-nf] that when \"He looked for righteousness therefrom, there was only a cry\"[fn-65-P6544_1925983:1221-nf] (of oppression).

Meanwhile, how is it that He chides them as being \"of little faith? \"[fn-64-P6497_1914414:1174-nf] What faith? Does He mean that faith which they were as yet unable to manifest perfectly in a god who has hardly yet revealed,[fn-64-P6498_1914563:1175-nf] and whom they were in process of learning as well as they could; or that faith which they for this express reason owed to the Creator, because they believed that He was of His own will supplying these wants of the human race, and therefore took no thought about them? Now, when He adds, \"For all these things do the nations of the world seek after,\"[fn-64-P6499_1914944:1176-nf] even by their not believing in God as the Creator and Giver of all things, since He was unwilling that they should be like these nations, He therefore upbraided them as being defective of faith in the same God, in whom He remarked that the Gentiles were quite wanting in faith. When He further adds, \"But your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things,\"[fn-65-P6500_1915328:1177-nf] I would first ask, what Father Christ would have to be here understood? If He points to their own Creator, He also affirms Him to be good, who knows what His children have need of; but if He refers to that other god, how does he know that food and raiment are necessary to man, seeing that he has made no such provision for him? For if he had known the want, he would have made the provision. If, however, he knows what things man has need of, and yet has failed to supply them, he is in the failure guilty of either malignity or weakness. But when he confessed that these things are necessary to man, he really affirmed that they are good. For nothing that is evil is necessary. So that he will not be any longer a depreciator of the works and the indulgences of the Creator, that I may here complete the answer[fn-65-P6501_1916165:1178-nf] which I deferred giving above. Again, if it is another god who has foreseen man's wants, and is supplying them, how is it that Marcion's Christ himself promises them?[fn-65-P6502_1916353:1179-nf] Is he liberal with another's property?[fn-65-P6503_1916415:1180-nf] \"Seek ye,\" says he, \"the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you\"-by himself, of course. But if by himself, what sort of being is he, who shall bestow the things of another? If by the Creator, whose all things are, then who[fn-65-P6504_1916686:1181-nf] is he that promises what belongs to another? If these things are \"additions\" to the kingdom, they must be placed in the second rank;[fn-65-P6505_1916836:1182-nf] and the second rank belongs to Him to whom the first also does; His are the food and raiment, whose is the kingdom. Thus to the Creator belongs the entire promise, the full reality[fn-65-P6506_1917041:1183-nf] of its parables, the perfect equalization[fn-65-P6507_1917100:1184-nf] of its similitudes; for these have respect to none other than Him to whom they have a parity of relation in every point.[fn-65-P6508_1917243:1185-nf] We are servants because we have a Lord in our God. We ought \"to have our loins girded: \"[fn-65-P6509_1917368:1186-nf] in other words, we are to be free from the embarrassments of a perplexed and much occupied life; \"to have our lights burning,\"[fn-65-P6510_1917518:1187-nf] that is, our minds kindled by faith, and resplendent with the works of truth. And thus \"to wait for our Lord,\"[fn-65-P6511_1917652:1188-nf] that is, Christ. Whence \"returning? \"If \"from the wedding,\" He is the Christ of the Creator, for the wedding is His. If He is not the Creator's, not even Marcion himself would have gone to the wedding, although invited, for in his god he discovers one who hates the nuptial bed. The parable would therefore have failed in the person of the Lord, if He were not a Being to whom a wedding is consistent. In the next parable also he makes a flagrant mistake, when he assigns to the person of the Creator that \"thief, whose hour, if the father of the family had only known, he would not have suffered his house to be broken through.\"[fn-65-P6512_1918305:1189-nf] How can the Creator wear in any way the aspect of a thief, Lord as He is of all mankind? No one pilfers or plunders his own property, but he[fn-65-P6513_1918469:1190-nf] rather acts the part of one who swoops down on the things of another, and alienates man from his Lord.[fn-65-P6514_1918598:1191-nf] Again, when He indicates to us that the devil is \"the thief,\" whose hour at the very beginning of the world, if man had known, he would never have been broken in upon[fn-65-P6515_1918805:1192-nf] by him, He warns us \"to be ready,\" for this reason, because \"we know not the hour when the Son of man shall come\"[fn-65-P6516_1918939:1193-nf] -not as if He were Himself the thief, but rather as being the judge of those who prepared not themselves, and used no precaution against the thief. Since, then, He is the Son of man, I hold Him to be the Judge, and in the Judge I claim[fn-65-P6517_1919197:1194-nf] the Creator. If then in this passage he displays the Creator's Christ under the title \"Son of man,\" that he may give us some presage[fn-65-P6518_1919348:1195-nf] of the thief, of the period of whose coming we are ignorant, you still have it ruled above, that no one is the thief of his own property; besides which, there is our principle also unimpaired[fn-65-P6519_1919560:1196-nf] -that in as far as He insists on the Creator as an object of fear, in so far does He belong to the Creator, and does the Creator's work. When, therefore, Peter asked whether He had spoken the parable \"unto them, or even to all,\"[fn-65-P6520_1919805:1197-nf] He sets forth for them, and for all who should bear rule in the churches, the similitude of stewards.[fn-65-P6521_1919930:1198-nf] That steward who should treat his fellow-servants well in his Lord's absence, would on his return be set as ruler over all his property; but he who should act otherwise should be severed, and have his portion with the unbelievers, when his lord should return on the day when he looked not for him, at the hour when he was not aware[fn-65-P6522_1920280:1199-nf] -even that Son of man, the Creator's Christ, not a thief, but a Judge. He accordingly, in this passage, either presents to us the Lord as a Judge, and instructs us in His character,[fn-65-P6523_1920488:1200-nf] or else as the simply good god; if the latter, he now also affirms his judicial attribute, although the heretic refuses to admit it. For an attempt is made to modify this sense when it is applied to his god,-as if it were an act of serenity and mildness simply to sever the man off, and to assign him a portion with the unbelievers, under the idea that he was not summoned (before the judge), but only returned to his own state! As if this very process did not imply a judicial act! What folly! What will be the end of i the severed ones? Will it not be the forfeiture of salvation, since their separation will be from those who shall attain salvation? What, again, will be the condition of the unbelievers? Will it not be damnation? Else, if these severed and unfaithful ones shall have nothing to suffer, there will, on the other hand, be nothing for the accepted and the believers to obtain. If, however, the accepted and the believers shall attain salvation, it must needs be that the rejected and the unbelieving should incur the opposite issue, even the loss of salvation. Now here is a judgment, and He who holds it out before us belongs to the Creator. Whom else than the God of retribution can I understand by Him who shall \"beat His servants with stripes,\" either \"few or many,\" and shall exact from them what He had committed to them?

If then in this passage he displays the Creator's Christ under the title \"Son of man,\" that he may give us some presage[fn-65-P6518_1919348:1195-nf] of the thief, of the period of whose coming we are ignorant, you still have it ruled above, that no one is the thief of his own property; besides which, there is our principle also unimpaired[fn-65-P6519_1919560:1196-nf] -that in as far as He insists on the Creator as an object of fear, in so far does He belong to the Creator, and does the Creator's work. When, therefore, Peter asked whether He had spoken the parable \"unto them, or even to all,\"[fn-65-P6520_1919805:1197-nf] He sets forth for them, and for all who should bear rule in the churches, the similitude of stewards.[fn-65-P6521_1919930:1198-nf] That steward who should treat his fellow-servants well in his Lord's absence, would on his return be set as ruler over all his property; but he who should act otherwise should be severed, and have his portion with the unbelievers, when his lord should return on the day when he looked not for him, at the hour when he was not aware[fn-65-P6522_1920280:1199-nf] -even that Son of man, the Creator's Christ, not a thief, but a Judge. He accordingly, in this passage, either presents to us the Lord as a Judge, and instructs us in His character,[fn-65-P6523_1920488:1200-nf] or else as the simply good god; if the latter, he now also affirms his judicial attribute, although the heretic refuses to admit it. For an attempt is made to modify this sense when it is applied to his god,-as if it were an act of serenity and mildness simply to sever the man off, and to assign him a portion with the unbelievers, under the idea that he was not summoned (before the judge), but only returned to his own state! As if this very process did not imply a judicial act! What folly! What will be the end of i the severed ones? Will it not be the forfeiture of salvation, since their separation will be from those who shall attain salvation? What, again, will be the condition of the unbelievers? Will it not be damnation? Else, if these severed and unfaithful ones shall have nothing to suffer, there will, on the other hand, be nothing for the accepted and the believers to obtain. If, however, the accepted and the believers shall attain salvation, it must needs be that the rejected and the unbelieving should incur the opposite issue, even the loss of salvation. Now here is a judgment, and He who holds it out before us belongs to the Creator. Whom else than the God of retribution can I understand by Him who shall \"beat His servants with stripes,\" either \"few or many,\" and shall exact from them what He had committed to them? Whom is it suitable[fn-65-P6524_1921881:1201-nf] for me to obey, but Him who remunerates? Your Christ proclaims, \"I am come to send fire on the earth.\"[fn-65-P6525_1922000:1202-nf] That[fn-65-P6526_1922028:1203-nf] most lenient being, the lord who has no hell, not long before had restrained his disciples from demanding fire on the churlish village. Whereas He[fn-65-P6527_1922208:1204-nf] burnt up Sodom and Gomorrah with a tempest of fire. Of Him the psalmist sang, \"A fire shall go out before Him, and burn up His enemies round about.\"[fn-65-P6528_1922385:1205-nf] By Hoses He uttered the threat, \"I will send a fire upon the cities of Judah; \"[fn-65-P6529_1922488:1206-nf] and[fn-65-P6530_1922516:1207-nf] by Isaiah, \"A fire has been kindled in mine anger.\" He cannot lie. If it is not He who uttered His voice out of even the burning bush, it can be of no importance[fn-65-P6531_1922854:1208-nf] what fire you insist upon being understood. Even if it be but figurative fire, yet, from the very fact that he takes from my element illustrations for His own sense, He is mine, because He uses what is mine. The similitude of fire must belong to Him who owns the reality thereof. But He will Himself best explain the quality of that fire which He mentioned, when He goes on to say, \"Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division.\"[fn-65-P6532_1923344:1209-nf] It is written \"a sword,\"[fn-65-P6533_1923392:1210-nf] but Marcion makes an emendation[fn-65-P6534_1923880:1211-nf] of the word, just as if a division were not the work of the sword. He, therefore, who refused to give peace, intended also the fire of destruction. As is the combat, so is the burning. As is the sword, so is the flame. Neither is suitable for its lord. He says at last, \"The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother-in-law against the daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law.\"[fn-65-P6535_1924476:1212-nf] Since this battle among the relatives[fn-65-P6536_1924537:1213-nf] was sung by the prophet's trumpet in the very words, I fear that Micah[fn-65-P6537_1924627:1214-nf] must have predicted it to Marcion's Christ! On this account He pronounced them \"hypocrites,\" because they could \"discern the face of the sky and the earth, but could not distinguish this time,\"[fn-65-P6538_1924843:1215-nf] when of course He ought to have been recognised, fulfilling (as he was) all things which had been predicted concerning them, and teaching them so. But then who could know the times of him of whom he had no evidence to prove his existence? Justly also does He upbraid them for \"not even of themselves judging what is right.\"[fn-65-P6539_1925190:1216-nf] Of old does He command by Zechariah, \"Execute the judgment of truth and peace; \"[fn-65-P6540_1925294:1217-nf] by Jeremiah, \"Execute judgment and righteousness; \"[fn-65-P6541_1925371:1218-nf] by Isaiah, \"Judge the fatherless, plead for the widow,\"[fn-65-P6542_1925450:1219-nf] charging it as a fault upon the vine of Sorech,[fn-65-P6543_1925519:1220-nf] that when \"He looked for righteousness therefrom, there was only a cry\"[fn-65-P6544_1925983:1221-nf] (of oppression).

Meanwhile, how is it that He chides them as being \"of little faith? \"[fn-64-P6497_1914414:1174-nf] What faith? Does He mean that faith which they were as yet unable to manifest perfectly in a god who has hardly yet revealed,[fn-64-P6498_1914563:1175-nf] and whom they were in process of learning as well as they could; or that faith which they for this express reason owed to the Creator, because they believed that He was of His own will supplying these wants of the human race, and therefore took no thought about them? Now, when He adds, \"For all these things do the nations of the world seek after,\"[fn-64-P6499_1914944:1176-nf] even by their not believing in God as the Creator and Giver of all things, since He was unwilling that they should be like these nations, He therefore upbraided them as being defective of faith in the same God, in whom He remarked that the Gentiles were quite wanting in faith. When He further adds, \"But your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things,\"[fn-65-P6500_1915328:1177-nf] I would first ask, what Father Christ would have to be here understood? If He points to their own Creator, He also affirms Him to be good, who knows what His children have need of; but if He refers to that other god, how does he know that food and raiment are necessary to man, seeing that he has made no such provision for him? For if he had known the want, he would have made the provision. If, however, he knows what things man has need of, and yet has failed to supply them, he is in the failure guilty of either malignity or weakness. But when he confessed that these things are necessary to man, he really affirmed that they are good. For nothing that is evil is necessary. So that he will not be any longer a depreciator of the works and the indulgences of the Creator, that I may here complete the answer[fn-65-P6501_1916165:1178-nf] which I deferred giving above. Again, if it is another god who has foreseen man's wants, and is supplying them, how is it that Marcion's Christ himself promises them?[fn-65-P6502_1916353:1179-nf] Is he liberal with another's property?[fn-65-P6503_1916415:1180-nf] \"Seek ye,\" says he, \"the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you\"-by himself, of course. But if by himself, what sort of being is he, who shall bestow the things of another? If by the Creator, whose all things are, then who[fn-65-P6504_1916686:1181-nf] is he that promises what belongs to another? If these things are \"additions\" to the kingdom, they must be placed in the second rank;[fn-65-P6505_1916836:1182-nf] and the second rank belongs to Him to whom the first also does; His are the food and raiment, whose is the kingdom. Thus to the Creator belongs the entire promise, the full reality[fn-65-P6506_1917041:1183-nf] of its parables, the perfect equalization[fn-65-P6507_1917100:1184-nf] of its similitudes; for these have respect to none other than Him to whom they have a parity of relation in every point.[fn-65-P6508_1917243:1185-nf] We are servants because we have a Lord in our God. We ought \"to have our loins girded: \"[fn-65-P6509_1917368:1186-nf] in other words, we are to be free from the embarrassments of a perplexed and much occupied life; \"to have our lights burning,\"[fn-65-P6510_1917518:1187-nf] that is, our minds kindled by faith, and resplendent with the works of truth.

If He is not the Creator's, not even Marcion himself would have gone to the wedding, although invited, for in his god he discovers one who hates the nuptial bed. The parable would therefore have failed in the person of the Lord, if He were not a Being to whom a wedding is consistent. In the next parable also he makes a flagrant mistake, when he assigns to the person of the Creator that \"thief, whose hour, if the father of the family had only known, he would not have suffered his house to be broken through.\"[fn-65-P6512_1918305:1189-nf] How can the Creator wear in any way the aspect of a thief, Lord as He is of all mankind?

If these things are \"additions\" to the kingdom, they must be placed in the second rank;[fn-65-P6505_1916836:1182-nf] and the second rank belongs to Him to whom the first also does; His are the food and raiment, whose is the kingdom. Thus to the Creator belongs the entire promise, the full reality[fn-65-P6506_1917041:1183-nf] of its parables, the perfect equalization[fn-65-P6507_1917100:1184-nf] of its similitudes; for these have respect to none other than Him to whom they have a parity of relation in every point.[fn-65-P6508_1917243:1185-nf] We are servants because we have a Lord in our God. We ought \"to have our loins girded: \"[fn-65-P6509_1917368:1186-nf] in other words, we are to be free from the embarrassments of a perplexed and much occupied life; \"to have our lights burning,\"[fn-65-P6510_1917518:1187-nf] that is, our minds kindled by faith, and resplendent with the works of truth. And thus \"to wait for our Lord,\"[fn-65-P6511_1917652:1188-nf] that is, Christ. Whence \"returning? \"If \"from the wedding,\" He is the Christ of the Creator, for the wedding is His. If He is not the Creator's, not even Marcion himself would have gone to the wedding, although invited, for in his god he discovers one who hates the nuptial bed. The parable would therefore have failed in the person of the Lord, if He were not a Being to whom a wedding is consistent. In the next parable also he makes a flagrant mistake, when he assigns to the person of the Creator that \"thief, whose hour, if the father of the family had only known, he would not have suffered his house to be broken through.\"[fn-65-P6512_1918305:1189-nf] How can the Creator wear in any way the aspect of a thief, Lord as He is of all mankind? No one pilfers or plunders his own property, but he[fn-65-P6513_1918469:1190-nf] rather acts the part of one who swoops down on the things of another, and alienates man from his Lord.[fn-65-P6514_1918598:1191-nf] Again, when He indicates to us that the devil is \"the thief,\" whose hour at the very beginning of the world, if man had known, he would never have been broken in upon[fn-65-P6515_1918805:1192-nf] by him, He warns us \"to be ready,\" for this reason, because \"we know not the hour when the Son of man shall come\"[fn-65-P6516_1918939:1193-nf] -not as if He were Himself the thief, but rather as being the judge of those who prepared not themselves, and used no precaution against the thief. Since, then, He is the Son of man, I hold Him to be the Judge, and in the Judge I claim[fn-65-P6517_1919197:1194-nf] the Creator. If then in this passage he displays the Creator's Christ under the title \"Son of man,\" that he may give us some presage[fn-65-P6518_1919348:1195-nf] of the thief, of the period of whose coming we are ignorant, you still have it ruled above, that no one is the thief of his own property; besides which, there is our principle also unimpaired[fn-65-P6519_1919560:1196-nf] -that in as far as He insists on the Creator as an object of fear, in so far does He belong to the Creator, and does the Creator's work. When, therefore, Peter asked whether He had spoken the parable \"unto them, or even to all,\"[fn-65-P6520_1919805:1197-nf] He sets forth for them, and for all who should bear rule in the churches, the similitude of stewards.[fn-65-P6521_1919930:1198-nf] That steward who should treat his fellow-servants well in his Lord's absence, would on his return be set as ruler over all his property; but he who should act otherwise should be severed, and have his portion with the unbelievers, when his lord should return on the day when he looked not for him, at the hour when he was not aware[fn-65-P6522_1920280:1199-nf] -even that Son of man, the Creator's Christ, not a thief, but a Judge. He accordingly, in this passage, either presents to us the Lord as a Judge, and instructs us in His character,[fn-65-P6523_1920488:1200-nf] or else as the simply good god; if the latter, he now also affirms his judicial attribute, although the heretic refuses to admit it. For an attempt is made to modify this sense when it is applied to his god,-as if it were an act of serenity and mildness simply to sever the man off, and to assign him a portion with the unbelievers, under the idea that he was not summoned (before the judge), but only returned to his own state! As if this very process did not imply a judicial act! What folly! What will be the end of i the severed ones? Will it not be the forfeiture of salvation, since their separation will be from those who shall attain salvation? What, again, will be the condition of the unbelievers? Will it not be damnation? Else, if these severed and unfaithful ones shall have nothing to suffer, there will, on the other hand, be nothing for the accepted and the believers to obtain. If, however, the accepted and the believers shall attain salvation, it must needs be that the rejected and the unbelieving should incur the opposite issue, even the loss of salvation. Now here is a judgment, and He who holds it out before us belongs to the Creator. Whom else than the God of retribution can I understand by Him who shall \"beat His servants with stripes,\" either \"few or many,\" and shall exact from them what He had committed to them? Whom is it suitable[fn-65-P6524_1921881:1201-nf] for me to obey, but Him who remunerates? Your Christ proclaims, \"I am come to send fire on the earth.\"[fn-65-P6525_1922000:1202-nf] That[fn-65-P6526_1922028:1203-nf] most lenient being, the lord who has no hell, not long before had restrained his disciples from demanding fire on the churlish village. Whereas He[fn-65-P6527_1922208:1204-nf] burnt up Sodom and Gomorrah with a tempest of fire. Of Him the psalmist sang, \"A fire shall go out before Him, and burn up His enemies round about.\"[fn-65-P6528_1922385:1205-nf] By Hoses He uttered the threat, \"I will send a fire upon the cities of Judah; \"[fn-65-P6529_1922488:1206-nf] and[fn-65-P6530_1922516:1207-nf] by Isaiah, \"A fire has been kindled in mine anger.\" He cannot lie. If it is not He who uttered His voice out of even the burning bush, it can be of no importance[fn-65-P6531_1922854:1208-nf] what fire you insist upon being understood. Even if it be but figurative fire, yet, from the very fact that he takes from my element illustrations for His own sense, He is mine, because He uses what is mine. The similitude of fire must belong to Him who owns the reality thereof. But He will Himself best explain the quality of that fire which He mentioned, when He goes on to say, \"Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division.\"[fn-65-P6532_1923344:1209-nf] It is written \"a sword,\"[fn-65-P6533_1923392:1210-nf] but Marcion makes an emendation[fn-65-P6534_1923880:1211-nf] of the word, just as if a division were not the work of the sword. He, therefore, who refused to give peace, intended also the fire of destruction. As is the combat, so is the burning. As is the sword, so is the flame. Neither is suitable for its lord. He says at last, \"The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother-in-law against the daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law.\"[fn-65-P6535_1924476:1212-nf] Since this battle among the relatives[fn-65-P6536_1924537:1213-nf] was sung by the prophet's trumpet in the very words, I fear that Micah[fn-65-P6537_1924627:1214-nf] must have predicted it to Marcion's Christ! On this account He pronounced them \"hypocrites,\" because they could \"discern the face of the sky and the earth, but could not distinguish this time,\"[fn-65-P6538_1924843:1215-nf] when of course He ought to have been recognised, fulfilling (as he was) all things which had been predicted concerning them, and teaching them so. But then who could know the times of him of whom he had no evidence to prove his existence? Justly also does He upbraid them for \"not even of themselves judging what is right.\"[fn-65-P6539_1925190:1216-nf] Of old does He command by Zechariah, \"Execute the judgment of truth and peace; \"[fn-65-P6540_1925294:1217-nf] by Jeremiah, \"Execute judgment and righteousness; \"[fn-65-P6541_1925371:1218-nf] by Isaiah, \"Judge the fatherless, plead for the widow,\"[fn-65-P6542_1925450:1219-nf] charging it as a fault upon the vine of Sorech,[fn-65-P6543_1925519:1220-nf] that when \"He looked for righteousness therefrom, there was only a cry\"[fn-65-P6544_1925983:1221-nf] (of oppression).

Meanwhile, how is it that He chides them as being \"of little faith? \"[fn-64-P6497_1914414:1174-nf] What faith? Does He mean that faith which they were as yet unable to manifest perfectly in a god who has hardly yet revealed,[fn-64-P6498_1914563:1175-nf] and whom they were in process of learning as well as they could; or that faith which they for this express reason owed to the Creator, because they believed that He was of His own will supplying these wants of the human race, and therefore took no thought about them? Now, when He adds, \"For all these things do the nations of the world seek after,\"[fn-64-P6499_1914944:1176-nf] even by their not believing in God as the Creator and Giver of all things, since He was unwilling that they should be like these nations, He therefore upbraided them as being defective of faith in the same God, in whom He remarked that the Gentiles were quite wanting in faith. When He further adds, \"But your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things,\"[fn-65-P6500_1915328:1177-nf] I would first ask, what Father Christ would have to be here understood? If He points to their own Creator, He also affirms Him to be good, who knows what His children have need of; but if He refers to that other god, how does he know that food and raiment are necessary to man, seeing that he has made no such provision for him? For if he had known the want, he would have made the provision. If, however, he knows what things man has need of, and yet has failed to supply them, he is in the failure guilty of either malignity or weakness. But when he confessed that these things are necessary to man, he really affirmed that they are good. For nothing that is evil is necessary. So that he will not be any longer a depreciator of the works and the indulgences of the Creator, that I may here complete the answer[fn-65-P6501_1916165:1178-nf] which I deferred giving above. Again, if it is another god who has foreseen man's wants, and is supplying them, how is it that Marcion's Christ himself promises them?[fn-65-P6502_1916353:1179-nf] Is he liberal with another's property?[fn-65-P6503_1916415:1180-nf] \"Seek ye,\" says he, \"the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you\"-by himself, of course. But if by himself, what sort of being is he, who shall bestow the things of another? If by the Creator, whose all things are, then who[fn-65-P6504_1916686:1181-nf] is he that promises what belongs to another? If these things are \"additions\" to the kingdom, they must be placed in the second rank;[fn-65-P6505_1916836:1182-nf] and the second rank belongs to Him to whom the first also does; His are the food and raiment, whose is the kingdom.

Now, when He adds, \"For all these things do the nations of the world seek after,\"[fn-64-P6499_1914944:1176-nf] even by their not believing in God as the Creator and Giver of all things, since He was unwilling that they should be like these nations, He therefore upbraided them as being defective of faith in the same God, in whom He remarked that the Gentiles were quite wanting in faith. When He further adds, \"But your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things,\"[fn-65-P6500_1915328:1177-nf] I would first ask, what Father Christ would have to be here understood? If He points to their own Creator, He also affirms Him to be good, who knows what His children have need of; but if He refers to that other god, how does he know that food and raiment are necessary to man, seeing that he has made no such provision for him? For if he had known the want, he would have made the provision. If, however, he knows what things man has need of, and yet has failed to supply them, he is in the failure guilty of either malignity or weakness. But when he confessed that these things are necessary to man, he really affirmed that they are good. For nothing that is evil is necessary. So that he will not be any longer a depreciator of the works and the indulgences of the Creator, that I may here complete the answer[fn-65-P6501_1916165:1178-nf] which I deferred giving above. Again, if it is another god who has foreseen man's wants, and is supplying them, how is it that Marcion's Christ himself promises them?[fn-65-P6502_1916353:1179-nf] Is he liberal with another's property?[fn-65-P6503_1916415:1180-nf] \"Seek ye,\" says he, \"the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you\"-by himself, of course. But if by himself, what sort of being is he, who shall bestow the things of another? If by the Creator, whose all things are, then who[fn-65-P6504_1916686:1181-nf] is he that promises what belongs to another? If these things are \"additions\" to the kingdom, they must be placed in the second rank;[fn-65-P6505_1916836:1182-nf] and the second rank belongs to Him to whom the first also does; His are the food and raiment, whose is the kingdom. Thus to the Creator belongs the entire promise, the full reality[fn-65-P6506_1917041:1183-nf] of its parables, the perfect equalization[fn-65-P6507_1917100:1184-nf] of its similitudes; for these have respect to none other than Him to whom they have a parity of relation in every point.[fn-65-P6508_1917243:1185-nf] We are servants because we have a Lord in our God. We ought \"to have our loins girded: \"[fn-65-P6509_1917368:1186-nf] in other words, we are to be free from the embarrassments of a perplexed and much occupied life; \"to have our lights burning,\"[fn-65-P6510_1917518:1187-nf] that is, our minds kindled by faith, and resplendent with the works of truth. And thus \"to wait for our Lord,\"[fn-65-P6511_1917652:1188-nf] that is, Christ. Whence \"returning? \"If \"from the wedding,\" He is the Christ of the Creator, for the wedding is His. If He is not the Creator's, not even Marcion himself would have gone to the wedding, although invited, for in his god he discovers one who hates the nuptial bed. The parable would therefore have failed in the person of the Lord, if He were not a Being to whom a wedding is consistent. In the next parable also he makes a flagrant mistake, when he assigns to the person of the Creator that \"thief, whose hour, if the father of the family had only known, he would not have suffered his house to be broken through.\"[fn-65-P6512_1918305:1189-nf] How can the Creator wear in any way the aspect of a thief, Lord as He is of all mankind? No one pilfers or plunders his own property, but he[fn-65-P6513_1918469:1190-nf] rather acts the part of one who swoops down on the things of another, and alienates man from his Lord.[fn-65-P6514_1918598:1191-nf] Again, when He indicates to us that the devil is \"the thief,\" whose hour at the very beginning of the world, if man had known, he would never have been broken in upon[fn-65-P6515_1918805:1192-nf] by him, He warns us \"to be ready,\" for this reason, because \"we know not the hour when the Son of man shall come\"[fn-65-P6516_1918939:1193-nf] -not as if He were Himself the thief, but rather as being the judge of those who prepared not themselves, and used no precaution against the thief. Since, then, He is the Son of man, I hold Him to be the Judge, and in the Judge I claim[fn-65-P6517_1919197:1194-nf] the Creator. If then in this passage he displays the Creator's Christ under the title \"Son of man,\" that he may give us some presage[fn-65-P6518_1919348:1195-nf] of the thief, of the period of whose coming we are ignorant, you still have it ruled above, that no one is the thief of his own property; besides which, there is our principle also unimpaired[fn-65-P6519_1919560:1196-nf] -that in as far as He insists on the Creator as an object of fear, in so far does He belong to the Creator, and does the Creator's work. When, therefore, Peter asked whether He had spoken the parable \"unto them, or even to all,\"[fn-65-P6520_1919805:1197-nf] He sets forth for them, and for all who should bear rule in the churches, the similitude of stewards.[fn-65-P6521_1919930:1198-nf] That steward who should treat his fellow-servants well in his Lord's absence, would on his return be set as ruler over all his property; but he who should act otherwise should be severed, and have his portion with the unbelievers, when his lord should return on the day when he looked not for him, at the hour when he was not aware[fn-65-P6522_1920280:1199-nf] -even that Son of man, the Creator's Christ, not a thief, but a Judge. He accordingly, in this passage, either presents to us the Lord as a Judge, and instructs us in His character,[fn-65-P6523_1920488:1200-nf] or else as the simply good god; if the latter, he now also affirms his judicial attribute, although the heretic refuses to admit it. For an attempt is made to modify this sense when it is applied to his god,-as if it were an act of serenity and mildness simply to sever the man off, and to assign him a portion with the unbelievers, under the idea that he was not summoned (before the judge), but only returned to his own state! As if this very process did not imply a judicial act! What folly! What will be the end of i the severed ones? Will it not be the forfeiture of salvation, since their separation will be from those who shall attain salvation? What, again, will be the condition of the unbelievers? Will it not be damnation? Else, if these severed and unfaithful ones shall have nothing to suffer, there will, on the other hand, be nothing for the accepted and the believers to obtain. If, however, the accepted and the believers shall attain salvation, it must needs be that the rejected and the unbelieving should incur the opposite issue, even the loss of salvation. Now here is a judgment, and He who holds it out before us belongs to the Creator. Whom else than the God of retribution can I understand by Him who shall \"beat His servants with stripes,\" either \"few or many,\" and shall exact from them what He had committed to them? Whom is it suitable[fn-65-P6524_1921881:1201-nf] for me to obey, but Him who remunerates? Your Christ proclaims, \"I am come to send fire on the earth.\"[fn-65-P6525_1922000:1202-nf] That[fn-65-P6526_1922028:1203-nf] most lenient being, the lord who has no hell, not long before had restrained his disciples from demanding fire on the churlish village. Whereas He[fn-65-P6527_1922208:1204-nf] burnt up Sodom and Gomorrah with a tempest of fire. Of Him the psalmist sang, \"A fire shall go out before Him, and burn up His enemies round about.\"[fn-65-P6528_1922385:1205-nf] By Hoses He uttered the threat, \"I will send a fire upon the cities of Judah; \"[fn-65-P6529_1922488:1206-nf] and[fn-65-P6530_1922516:1207-nf] by Isaiah, \"A fire has been kindled in mine anger.\" He cannot lie. If it is not He who uttered His voice out of even the burning bush, it can be of no importance[fn-65-P6531_1922854:1208-nf] what fire you insist upon being understood. Even if it be but figurative fire, yet, from the very fact that he takes from my element illustrations for His own sense, He is mine, because He uses what is mine. The similitude of fire must belong to Him who owns the reality thereof. But He will Himself best explain the quality of that fire which He mentioned, when He goes on to say, \"Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division.\"[fn-65-P6532_1923344:1209-nf] It is written \"a sword,\"[fn-65-P6533_1923392:1210-nf] but Marcion makes an emendation[fn-65-P6534_1923880:1211-nf] of the word, just as if a division were not the work of the sword. He, therefore, who refused to give peace, intended also the fire of destruction. As is the combat, so is the burning. As is the sword, so is the flame. Neither is suitable for its lord. He says at last, \"The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother-in-law against the daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law.\"[fn-65-P6535_1924476:1212-nf] Since this battle among the relatives[fn-65-P6536_1924537:1213-nf] was sung by the prophet's trumpet in the very words, I fear that Micah[fn-65-P6537_1924627:1214-nf] must have predicted it to Marcion's Christ! On this account He pronounced them \"hypocrites,\" because they could \"discern the face of the sky and the earth, but could not distinguish this time,\"[fn-65-P6538_1924843:1215-nf] when of course He ought to have been recognised, fulfilling (as he was) all things which had been predicted concerning them, and teaching them so. But then who could know the times of him of whom he had no evidence to prove his existence? Justly also does He upbraid them for \"not even of themselves judging what is right.\"[fn-65-P6539_1925190:1216-nf] Of old does He command by Zechariah, \"Execute the judgment of truth and peace; \"[fn-65-P6540_1925294:1217-nf] by Jeremiah, \"Execute judgment and righteousness; \"[fn-65-P6541_1925371:1218-nf] by Isaiah, \"Judge the fatherless, plead for the widow,\"[fn-65-P6542_1925450:1219-nf] charging it as a fault upon the vine of Sorech,[fn-65-P6543_1925519:1220-nf] that when \"He looked for righteousness therefrom, there was only a cry\"[fn-65-P6544_1925983:1221-nf] (of oppression).

But how absurd, that he should now be commanding them to judge righteously, who was destroying God the righteous Judge! For the Judge, who commits to prison, and allows no release Out of it without the payment of \"the very last mite,\"[fn-65-P6547_1926501:1224-nf] they treat of in the person of the Creator, with the view of disparaging Him. Which cavil, however, I deem it necessary to meet with the same answer.[fn-65-P6548_1926677:1225-nf] For as often as the Creator's severity is paraded before us, so often is Christ (shown to be) His, to whom He urges submission by the motive of fear.

Meanwhile, how is it that He chides them as being \"of little faith? \"[fn-64-P6497_1914414:1174-nf] What faith? Does He mean that faith which they were as yet unable to manifest perfectly in a god who has hardly yet revealed,[fn-64-P6498_1914563:1175-nf] and whom they were in process of learning as well as they could; or that faith which they for this express reason owed to the Creator, because they believed that He was of His own will supplying these wants of the human race, and therefore took no thought about them? Now, when He adds, \"For all these things do the nations of the world seek after,\"[fn-64-P6499_1914944:1176-nf] even by their not believing in God as the Creator and Giver of all things, since He was unwilling that they should be like these nations, He therefore upbraided them as being defective of faith in the same God, in whom He remarked that the Gentiles were quite wanting in faith. When He further adds, \"But your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things,\"[fn-65-P6500_1915328:1177-nf] I would first ask, what Father Christ would have to be here understood? If He points to their own Creator, He also affirms Him to be good, who knows what His children have need of; but if He refers to that other god, how does he know that food and raiment are necessary to man, seeing that he has made no such provision for him? For if he had known the want, he would have made the provision. If, however, he knows what things man has need of, and yet has failed to supply them, he is in the failure guilty of either malignity or weakness. But when he confessed that these things are necessary to man, he really affirmed that they are good. For nothing that is evil is necessary. So that he will not be any longer a depreciator of the works and the indulgences of the Creator, that I may here complete the answer[fn-65-P6501_1916165:1178-nf] which I deferred giving above. Again, if it is another god who has foreseen man's wants, and is supplying them, how is it that Marcion's Christ himself promises them?[fn-65-P6502_1916353:1179-nf] Is he liberal with another's property?[fn-65-P6503_1916415:1180-nf] \"Seek ye,\" says he, \"the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you\"-by himself, of course. But if by himself, what sort of being is he, who shall bestow the things of another? If by the Creator, whose all things are, then who[fn-65-P6504_1916686:1181-nf] is he that promises what belongs to another? If these things are \"additions\" to the kingdom, they must be placed in the second rank;[fn-65-P6505_1916836:1182-nf] and the second rank belongs to Him to whom the first also does; His are the food and raiment, whose is the kingdom. Thus to the Creator belongs the entire promise, the full reality[fn-65-P6506_1917041:1183-nf] of its parables, the perfect equalization[fn-65-P6507_1917100:1184-nf] of its similitudes; for these have respect to none other than Him to whom they have a parity of relation in every point.[fn-65-P6508_1917243:1185-nf] We are servants because we have a Lord in our God. We ought \"to have our loins girded: \"[fn-65-P6509_1917368:1186-nf] in other words, we are to be free from the embarrassments of a perplexed and much occupied life; \"to have our lights burning,\"[fn-65-P6510_1917518:1187-nf] that is, our minds kindled by faith, and resplendent with the works of truth. And thus \"to wait for our Lord,\"[fn-65-P6511_1917652:1188-nf] that is, Christ. Whence \"returning? \"If \"from the wedding,\" He is the Christ of the Creator, for the wedding is His. If He is not the Creator's, not even Marcion himself would have gone to the wedding, although invited, for in his god he discovers one who hates the nuptial bed. The parable would therefore have failed in the person of the Lord, if He were not a Being to whom a wedding is consistent. In the next parable also he makes a flagrant mistake, when he assigns to the person of the Creator that \"thief, whose hour, if the father of the family had only known, he would not have suffered his house to be broken through.\"[fn-65-P6512_1918305:1189-nf] How can the Creator wear in any way the aspect of a thief, Lord as He is of all mankind? No one pilfers or plunders his own property, but he[fn-65-P6513_1918469:1190-nf] rather acts the part of one who swoops down on the things of another, and alienates man from his Lord.[fn-65-P6514_1918598:1191-nf] Again, when He indicates to us that the devil is \"the thief,\" whose hour at the very beginning of the world, if man had known, he would never have been broken in upon[fn-65-P6515_1918805:1192-nf] by him, He warns us \"to be ready,\" for this reason, because \"we know not the hour when the Son of man shall come\"[fn-65-P6516_1918939:1193-nf] -not as if He were Himself the thief, but rather as being the judge of those who prepared not themselves, and used no precaution against the thief. Since, then, He is the Son of man, I hold Him to be the Judge, and in the Judge I claim[fn-65-P6517_1919197:1194-nf] the Creator. If then in this passage he displays the Creator's Christ under the title \"Son of man,\" that he may give us some presage[fn-65-P6518_1919348:1195-nf] of the thief, of the period of whose coming we are ignorant, you still have it ruled above, that no one is the thief of his own property; besides which, there is our principle also unimpaired[fn-65-P6519_1919560:1196-nf] -that in as far as He insists on the Creator as an object of fear, in so far does He belong to the Creator, and does the Creator's work. When, therefore, Peter asked whether He had spoken the parable \"unto them, or even to all,\"[fn-65-P6520_1919805:1197-nf] He sets forth for them, and for all who should bear rule in the churches, the similitude of stewards.[fn-65-P6521_1919930:1198-nf] That steward who should treat his fellow-servants well in his Lord's absence, would on his return be set as ruler over all his property; but he who should act otherwise should be severed, and have his portion with the unbelievers, when his lord should return on the day when he looked not for him, at the hour when he was not aware[fn-65-P6522_1920280:1199-nf] -even that Son of man, the Creator's Christ, not a thief, but a Judge. He accordingly, in this passage, either presents to us the Lord as a Judge, and instructs us in His character,[fn-65-P6523_1920488:1200-nf] or else as the simply good god; if the latter, he now also affirms his judicial attribute, although the heretic refuses to admit it. For an attempt is made to modify this sense when it is applied to his god,-as if it were an act of serenity and mildness simply to sever the man off, and to assign him a portion with the unbelievers, under the idea that he was not summoned (before the judge), but only returned to his own state! As if this very process did not imply a judicial act! What folly! What will be the end of i the severed ones? Will it not be the forfeiture of salvation, since their separation will be from those who shall attain salvation? What, again, will be the condition of the unbelievers? Will it not be damnation? Else, if these severed and unfaithful ones shall have nothing to suffer, there will, on the other hand, be nothing for the accepted and the believers to obtain. If, however, the accepted and the believers shall attain salvation, it must needs be that the rejected and the unbelieving should incur the opposite issue, even the loss of salvation. Now here is a judgment, and He who holds it out before us belongs to the Creator. Whom else than the God of retribution can I understand by Him who shall \"beat His servants with stripes,\" either \"few or many,\" and shall exact from them what He had committed to them? Whom is it suitable[fn-65-P6524_1921881:1201-nf] for me to obey, but Him who remunerates? Your Christ proclaims, \"I am come to send fire on the earth.\"[fn-65-P6525_1922000:1202-nf] That[fn-65-P6526_1922028:1203-nf] most lenient being, the lord who has no hell, not long before had restrained his disciples from demanding fire on the churlish village. Whereas He[fn-65-P6527_1922208:1204-nf] burnt up Sodom and Gomorrah with a tempest of fire. Of Him the psalmist sang, \"A fire shall go out before Him, and burn up His enemies round about.\"[fn-65-P6528_1922385:1205-nf] By Hoses He uttered the threat, \"I will send a fire upon the cities of Judah; \"[fn-65-P6529_1922488:1206-nf] and[fn-65-P6530_1922516:1207-nf] by Isaiah, \"A fire has been kindled in mine anger.\" He cannot lie. If it is not He who uttered His voice out of even the burning bush, it can be of no importance[fn-65-P6531_1922854:1208-nf] what fire you insist upon being understood. Even if it be but figurative fire, yet, from the very fact that he takes from my element illustrations for His own sense, He is mine, because He uses what is mine. The similitude of fire must belong to Him who owns the reality thereof. But He will Himself best explain the quality of that fire which He mentioned, when He goes on to say, \"Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division.\"[fn-65-P6532_1923344:1209-nf] It is written \"a sword,\"[fn-65-P6533_1923392:1210-nf] but Marcion makes an emendation[fn-65-P6534_1923880:1211-nf] of the word, just as if a division were not the work of the sword. He, therefore, who refused to give peace, intended also the fire of destruction. As is the combat, so is the burning. As is the sword, so is the flame. Neither is suitable for its lord. He says at last, \"The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother-in-law against the daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law.\"[fn-65-P6535_1924476:1212-nf] Since this battle among the relatives[fn-65-P6536_1924537:1213-nf] was sung by the prophet's trumpet in the very words, I fear that Micah[fn-65-P6537_1924627:1214-nf] must have predicted it to Marcion's Christ! On this account He pronounced them \"hypocrites,\" because they could \"discern the face of the sky and the earth, but could not distinguish this time,\"[fn-65-P6538_1924843:1215-nf] when of course He ought to have been recognised, fulfilling (as he was) all things which had been predicted concerning them, and teaching them so. But then who could know the times of him of whom he had no evidence to prove his existence? Justly also does He upbraid them for \"not even of themselves judging what is right.\"[fn-65-P6539_1925190:1216-nf] Of old does He command by Zechariah, \"Execute the judgment of truth and peace; \"[fn-65-P6540_1925294:1217-nf] by Jeremiah, \"Execute judgment and righteousness; \"[fn-65-P6541_1925371:1218-nf] by Isaiah, \"Judge the fatherless, plead for the widow,\"[fn-65-P6542_1925450:1219-nf] charging it as a fault upon the vine of Sorech,[fn-65-P6543_1925519:1220-nf] that when \"He looked for righteousness therefrom, there was only a cry\"[fn-65-P6544_1925983:1221-nf] (of oppression).

Now, when He adds, \"For all these things do the nations of the world seek after,\"[fn-64-P6499_1914944:1176-nf] even by their not believing in God as the Creator and Giver of all things, since He was unwilling that they should be like these nations, He therefore upbraided them as being defective of faith in the same God, in whom He remarked that the Gentiles were quite wanting in faith. When He further adds, \"But your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things,\"[fn-65-P6500_1915328:1177-nf] I would first ask, what Father Christ would have to be here understood? If He points to their own Creator, He also affirms Him to be good, who knows what His children have need of; but if He refers to that other god, how does he know that food and raiment are necessary to man, seeing that he has made no such provision for him? For if he had known the want, he would have made the provision. If, however, he knows what things man has need of, and yet has failed to supply them, he is in the failure guilty of either malignity or weakness. But when he confessed that these things are necessary to man, he really affirmed that they are good. For nothing that is evil is necessary. So that he will not be any longer a depreciator of the works and the indulgences of the Creator, that I may here complete the answer[fn-65-P6501_1916165:1178-nf] which I deferred giving above. Again, if it is another god who has foreseen man's wants, and is supplying them, how is it that Marcion's Christ himself promises them?[fn-65-P6502_1916353:1179-nf] Is he liberal with another's property?[fn-65-P6503_1916415:1180-nf] \"Seek ye,\" says he, \"the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you\"-by himself, of course. But if by himself, what sort of being is he, who shall bestow the things of another? If by the Creator, whose all things are, then who[fn-65-P6504_1916686:1181-nf] is he that promises what belongs to another? If these things are \"additions\" to the kingdom, they must be placed in the second rank;[fn-65-P6505_1916836:1182-nf] and the second rank belongs to Him to whom the first also does; His are the food and raiment, whose is the kingdom. Thus to the Creator belongs the entire promise, the full reality[fn-65-P6506_1917041:1183-nf] of its parables, the perfect equalization[fn-65-P6507_1917100:1184-nf] of its similitudes; for these have respect to none other than Him to whom they have a parity of relation in every point.[fn-65-P6508_1917243:1185-nf] We are servants because we have a Lord in our God. We ought \"to have our loins girded: \"[fn-65-P6509_1917368:1186-nf] in other words, we are to be free from the embarrassments of a perplexed and much occupied life; \"to have our lights burning,\"[fn-65-P6510_1917518:1187-nf] that is, our minds kindled by faith, and resplendent with the works of truth.

The parable would therefore have failed in the person of the Lord, if He were not a Being to whom a wedding is consistent. In the next parable also he makes a flagrant mistake, when he assigns to the person of the Creator that \"thief, whose hour, if the father of the family had only known, he would not have suffered his house to be broken through.\"[fn-65-P6512_1918305:1189-nf] How can the Creator wear in any way the aspect of a thief, Lord as He is of all mankind? No one pilfers or plunders his own property, but he[fn-65-P6513_1918469:1190-nf] rather acts the part of one who swoops down on the things of another, and alienates man from his Lord.[fn-65-P6514_1918598:1191-nf] Again, when He indicates to us that the devil is \"the thief,\" whose hour at the very beginning of the world, if man had known, he would never have been broken in upon[fn-65-P6515_1918805:1192-nf] by him, He warns us \"to be ready,\" for this reason, because \"we know not the hour when the Son of man shall come\"[fn-65-P6516_1918939:1193-nf] -not as if He were Himself the thief, but rather as being the judge of those who prepared not themselves, and used no precaution against the thief. Since, then, He is the Son of man, I hold Him to be the Judge, and in the Judge I claim[fn-65-P6517_1919197:1194-nf] the Creator. If then in this passage he displays the Creator's Christ under the title \"Son of man,\" that he may give us some presage[fn-65-P6518_1919348:1195-nf] of the thief, of the period of whose coming we are ignorant, you still have it ruled above, that no one is the thief of his own property; besides which, there is our principle also unimpaired[fn-65-P6519_1919560:1196-nf] -that in as far as He insists on the Creator as an object of fear, in so far does He belong to the Creator, and does the Creator's work. When, therefore, Peter asked whether He had spoken the parable \"unto them, or even to all,\"[fn-65-P6520_1919805:1197-nf] He sets forth for them, and for all who should bear rule in the churches, the similitude of stewards.[fn-65-P6521_1919930:1198-nf] That steward who should treat his fellow-servants well in his Lord's absence, would on his return be set as ruler over all his property; but he who should act otherwise should be severed, and have his portion with the unbelievers, when his lord should return on the day when he looked not for him, at the hour when he was not aware[fn-65-P6522_1920280:1199-nf] -even that Son of man, the Creator's Christ, not a thief, but a Judge. He accordingly, in this passage, either presents to us the Lord as a Judge, and instructs us in His character,[fn-65-P6523_1920488:1200-nf] or else as the simply good god; if the latter, he now also affirms his judicial attribute, although the heretic refuses to admit it. For an attempt is made to modify this sense when it is applied to his god,-as if it were an act of serenity and mildness simply to sever the man off, and to assign him a portion with the unbelievers, under the idea that he was not summoned (before the judge), but only returned to his own state! As if this very process did not imply a judicial act! What folly! What will be the end of i the severed ones? Will it not be the forfeiture of salvation, since their separation will be from those who shall attain salvation? What, again, will be the condition of the unbelievers? Will it not be damnation? Else, if these severed and unfaithful ones shall have nothing to suffer, there will, on the other hand, be nothing for the accepted and the believers to obtain. If, however, the accepted and the believers shall attain salvation, it must needs be that the rejected and the unbelieving should incur the opposite issue, even the loss of salvation. Now here is a judgment, and He who holds it out before us belongs to the Creator. Whom else than the God of retribution can I understand by Him who shall \"beat His servants with stripes,\" either \"few or many,\" and shall exact from them what He had committed to them? Whom is it suitable[fn-65-P6524_1921881:1201-nf] for me to obey, but Him who remunerates? Your Christ proclaims, \"I am come to send fire on the earth.\"[fn-65-P6525_1922000:1202-nf] That[fn-65-P6526_1922028:1203-nf] most lenient being, the lord who has no hell, not long before had restrained his disciples from demanding fire on the churlish village. Whereas He[fn-65-P6527_1922208:1204-nf] burnt up Sodom and Gomorrah with a tempest of fire. Of Him the psalmist sang, \"A fire shall go out before Him, and burn up His enemies round about.\"[fn-65-P6528_1922385:1205-nf] By Hoses He uttered the threat, \"I will send a fire upon the cities of Judah; \"[fn-65-P6529_1922488:1206-nf] and[fn-65-P6530_1922516:1207-nf] by Isaiah, \"A fire has been kindled in mine anger.\" He cannot lie. If it is not He who uttered His voice out of even the burning bush, it can be of no importance[fn-65-P6531_1922854:1208-nf] what fire you insist upon being understood. Even if it be but figurative fire, yet, from the very fact that he takes from my element illustrations for His own sense, He is mine, because He uses what is mine. The similitude of fire must belong to Him who owns the reality thereof. But He will Himself best explain the quality of that fire which He mentioned, when He goes on to say, \"Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division.\"[fn-65-P6532_1923344:1209-nf] It is written \"a sword,\"[fn-65-P6533_1923392:1210-nf] but Marcion makes an emendation[fn-65-P6534_1923880:1211-nf] of the word, just as if a division were not the work of the sword.

Whereas He[fn-65-P6527_1922208:1204-nf] burnt up Sodom and Gomorrah with a tempest of fire. Of Him the psalmist sang, \"A fire shall go out before Him, and burn up His enemies round about.\"[fn-65-P6528_1922385:1205-nf] By Hoses He uttered the threat, \"I will send a fire upon the cities of Judah; \"[fn-65-P6529_1922488:1206-nf] and[fn-65-P6530_1922516:1207-nf] by Isaiah, \"A fire has been kindled in mine anger.\" He cannot lie.

Even if it be but figurative fire, yet, from the very fact that he takes from my element illustrations for His own sense, He is mine, because He uses what is mine. The similitude of fire must belong to Him who owns the reality thereof. But He will Himself best explain the quality of that fire which He mentioned, when He goes on to say, \"Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth?

He, therefore, who refused to give peace, intended also the fire of destruction. As is the combat, so is the burning. As is the sword, so is the flame. Neither is suitable for its lord.

Justly also does He upbraid them for \"not even of themselves judging what is right.\"[fn-65-P6539_1925190:1216-nf] Of old does He command by Zechariah, \"Execute the judgment of truth and peace; \"[fn-65-P6540_1925294:1217-nf] by Jeremiah, \"Execute judgment and righteousness; \"[fn-65-P6541_1925371:1218-nf] by Isaiah, \"Judge the fatherless, plead for the widow,\"[fn-65-P6542_1925450:1219-nf] charging it as a fault upon the vine of Sorech,[fn-65-P6543_1925519:1220-nf] that when \"He looked for righteousness therefrom, there was only a cry\"[fn-65-P6544_1925983:1221-nf] (of oppression).

Now, when He adds, \"For all these things do the nations of the world seek after,\"[fn-64-P6499_1914944:1176-nf] even by their not believing in God as the Creator and Giver of all things, since He was unwilling that they should be like these nations, He therefore upbraided them as being defective of faith in the same God, in whom He remarked that the Gentiles were quite wanting in faith. When He further adds, \"But your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things,\"[fn-65-P6500_1915328:1177-nf] I would first ask, what Father Christ would have to be here understood? If He points to their own Creator, He also affirms Him to be good, who knows what His children have need of; but if He refers to that other god, how does he know that food and raiment are necessary to man, seeing that he has made no such provision for him? For if he had known the want, he would have made the provision. If, however, he knows what things man has need of, and yet has failed to supply them, he is in the failure guilty of either malignity or weakness. But when he confessed that these things are necessary to man, he really affirmed that they are good. For nothing that is evil is necessary. So that he will not be any longer a depreciator of the works and the indulgences of the Creator, that I may here complete the answer[fn-65-P6501_1916165:1178-nf] which I deferred giving above. Again, if it is another god who has foreseen man's wants, and is supplying them, how is it that Marcion's Christ himself promises them?[fn-65-P6502_1916353:1179-nf] Is he liberal with another's property?[fn-65-P6503_1916415:1180-nf] \"Seek ye,\" says he, \"the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you\"-by himself, of course. But if by himself, what sort of being is he, who shall bestow the things of another? If by the Creator, whose all things are, then who[fn-65-P6504_1916686:1181-nf] is he that promises what belongs to another? If these things are \"additions\" to the kingdom, they must be placed in the second rank;[fn-65-P6505_1916836:1182-nf] and the second rank belongs to Him to whom the first also does; His are the food and raiment, whose is the kingdom. Thus to the Creator belongs the entire promise, the full reality[fn-65-P6506_1917041:1183-nf] of its parables, the perfect equalization[fn-65-P6507_1917100:1184-nf] of its similitudes; for these have respect to none other than Him to whom they have a parity of relation in every point.[fn-65-P6508_1917243:1185-nf] We are servants because we have a Lord in our God. We ought \"to have our loins girded: \"[fn-65-P6509_1917368:1186-nf] in other words, we are to be free from the embarrassments of a perplexed and much occupied life; \"to have our lights burning,\"[fn-65-P6510_1917518:1187-nf] that is, our minds kindled by faith, and resplendent with the works of truth. And thus \"to wait for our Lord,\"[fn-65-P6511_1917652:1188-nf] that is, Christ. Whence \"returning? \"If \"from the wedding,\" He is the Christ of the Creator, for the wedding is His. If He is not the Creator's, not even Marcion himself would have gone to the wedding, although invited, for in his god he discovers one who hates the nuptial bed. The parable would therefore have failed in the person of the Lord, if He were not a Being to whom a wedding is consistent. In the next parable also he makes a flagrant mistake, when he assigns to the person of the Creator that \"thief, whose hour, if the father of the family had only known, he would not have suffered his house to be broken through.\"[fn-65-P6512_1918305:1189-nf] How can the Creator wear in any way the aspect of a thief, Lord as He is of all mankind? No one pilfers or plunders his own property, but he[fn-65-P6513_1918469:1190-nf] rather acts the part of one who swoops down on the things of another, and alienates man from his Lord.[fn-65-P6514_1918598:1191-nf] Again, when He indicates to us that the devil is \"the thief,\" whose hour at the very beginning of the world, if man had known, he would never have been broken in upon[fn-65-P6515_1918805:1192-nf] by him, He warns us \"to be ready,\" for this reason, because \"we know not the hour when the Son of man shall come\"[fn-65-P6516_1918939:1193-nf] -not as if He were Himself the thief, but rather as being the judge of those who prepared not themselves, and used no precaution against the thief. Since, then, He is the Son of man, I hold Him to be the Judge, and in the Judge I claim[fn-65-P6517_1919197:1194-nf] the Creator. If then in this passage he displays the Creator's Christ under the title \"Son of man,\" that he may give us some presage[fn-65-P6518_1919348:1195-nf] of the thief, of the period of whose coming we are ignorant, you still have it ruled above, that no one is the thief of his own property; besides which, there is our principle also unimpaired[fn-65-P6519_1919560:1196-nf] -that in as far as He insists on the Creator as an object of fear, in so far does He belong to the Creator, and does the Creator's work. When, therefore, Peter asked whether He had spoken the parable \"unto them, or even to all,\"[fn-65-P6520_1919805:1197-nf] He sets forth for them, and for all who should bear rule in the churches, the similitude of stewards.[fn-65-P6521_1919930:1198-nf] That steward who should treat his fellow-servants well in his Lord's absence, would on his return be set as ruler over all his property; but he who should act otherwise should be severed, and have his portion with the unbelievers, when his lord should return on the day when he looked not for him, at the hour when he was not aware[fn-65-P6522_1920280:1199-nf] -even that Son of man, the Creator's Christ, not a thief, but a Judge. He accordingly, in this passage, either presents to us the Lord as a Judge, and instructs us in His character,[fn-65-P6523_1920488:1200-nf] or else as the simply good god; if the latter, he now also affirms his judicial attribute, although the heretic refuses to admit it. For an attempt is made to modify this sense when it is applied to his god,-as if it were an act of serenity and mildness simply to sever the man off, and to assign him a portion with the unbelievers, under the idea that he was not summoned (before the judge), but only returned to his own state! As if this very process did not imply a judicial act! What folly! What will be the end of i the severed ones? Will it not be the forfeiture of salvation, since their separation will be from those who shall attain salvation? What, again, will be the condition of the unbelievers? Will it not be damnation? Else, if these severed and unfaithful ones shall have nothing to suffer, there will, on the other hand, be nothing for the accepted and the believers to obtain. If, however, the accepted and the believers shall attain salvation, it must needs be that the rejected and the unbelieving should incur the opposite issue, even the loss of salvation. Now here is a judgment, and He who holds it out before us belongs to the Creator. Whom else than the God of retribution can I understand by Him who shall \"beat His servants with stripes,\" either \"few or many,\" and shall exact from them what He had committed to them?

If then in this passage he displays the Creator's Christ under the title \"Son of man,\" that he may give us some presage[fn-65-P6518_1919348:1195-nf] of the thief, of the period of whose coming we are ignorant, you still have it ruled above, that no one is the thief of his own property; besides which, there is our principle also unimpaired[fn-65-P6519_1919560:1196-nf] -that in as far as He insists on the Creator as an object of fear, in so far does He belong to the Creator, and does the Creator's work. When, therefore, Peter asked whether He had spoken the parable \"unto them, or even to all,\"[fn-65-P6520_1919805:1197-nf] He sets forth for them, and for all who should bear rule in the churches, the similitude of stewards.[fn-65-P6521_1919930:1198-nf] That steward who should treat his fellow-servants well in his Lord's absence, would on his return be set as ruler over all his property; but he who should act otherwise should be severed, and have his portion with the unbelievers, when his lord should return on the day when he looked not for him, at the hour when he was not aware[fn-65-P6522_1920280:1199-nf] -even that Son of man, the Creator's Christ, not a thief, but a Judge. He accordingly, in this passage, either presents to us the Lord as a Judge, and instructs us in His character,[fn-65-P6523_1920488:1200-nf] or else as the simply good god; if the latter, he now also affirms his judicial attribute, although the heretic refuses to admit it. For an attempt is made to modify this sense when it is applied to his god,-as if it were an act of serenity and mildness simply to sever the man off, and to assign him a portion with the unbelievers, under the idea that he was not summoned (before the judge), but only returned to his own state! As if this very process did not imply a judicial act! What folly! What will be the end of i the severed ones? Will it not be the forfeiture of salvation, since their separation will be from those who shall attain salvation? What, again, will be the condition of the unbelievers? Will it not be damnation? Else, if these severed and unfaithful ones shall have nothing to suffer, there will, on the other hand, be nothing for the accepted and the believers to obtain. If, however, the accepted and the believers shall attain salvation, it must needs be that the rejected and the unbelieving should incur the opposite issue, even the loss of salvation. Now here is a judgment, and He who holds it out before us belongs to the Creator.

Whereas He[fn-65-P6527_1922208:1204-nf] burnt up Sodom and Gomorrah with a tempest of fire. Of Him the psalmist sang, \"A fire shall go out before Him, and burn up His enemies round about.\"[fn-65-P6528_1922385:1205-nf] By Hoses He uttered the threat, \"I will send a fire upon the cities of Judah; \"[fn-65-P6529_1922488:1206-nf] and[fn-65-P6530_1922516:1207-nf] by Isaiah, \"A fire has been kindled in mine anger.\" He cannot lie. If it is not He who uttered His voice out of even the burning bush, it can be of no importance[fn-65-P6531_1922854:1208-nf] what fire you insist upon being understood. Even if it be but figurative fire, yet, from the very fact that he takes from my element illustrations for His own sense, He is mine, because He uses what is mine. The similitude of fire must belong to Him who owns the reality thereof.

Whether, indeed, it is as depreciating the Creator that he does not wish such trifles to be thought of, concerning which neither the crows nor the lilies labour, because, forsooth, they come spontaneously to hand[fn-64-P6495_1914219:1172-nf] by reason of their very worthlessness,[fn-64-P6496_1914284:1173-nf] will appear a little further on. Meanwhile, how is it that He chides them as being \"of little faith? \"[fn-64-P6497_1914414:1174-nf] What faith? Does He mean that faith which they were as yet unable to manifest perfectly in a god who has hardly yet revealed,[fn-64-P6498_1914563:1175-nf] and whom they were in process of learning as well as they could; or that faith which they for this express reason owed to the Creator, because they believed that He was of His own will supplying these wants of the human race, and therefore took no thought about them? Now, when He adds, \"For all these things do the nations of the world seek after,\"[fn-64-P6499_1914944:1176-nf] even by their not believing in God as the Creator and Giver of all things, since He was unwilling that they should be like these nations, He therefore upbraided them as being defective of faith in the same God, in whom He remarked that the Gentiles were quite wanting in faith. When He further adds, \"But your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things,\"[fn-65-P6500_1915328:1177-nf] I would first ask, what Father Christ would have to be here understood? If He points to their own Creator, He also affirms Him to be good, who knows what His children have need of; but if He refers to that other god, how does he know that food and raiment are necessary to man, seeing that he has made no such provision for him? For if he had known the want, he would have made the provision. If, however, he knows what things man has need of, and yet has failed to supply them, he is in the failure guilty of either malignity or weakness. But when he confessed that these things are necessary to man, he really affirmed that they are good. For nothing that is evil is necessary. So that he will not be any longer a depreciator of the works and the indulgences of the Creator, that I may here complete the answer[fn-65-P6501_1916165:1178-nf] which I deferred giving above. Again, if it is another god who has foreseen man's wants, and is supplying them, how is it that Marcion's Christ himself promises them?[fn-65-P6502_1916353:1179-nf] Is he liberal with another's property?[fn-65-P6503_1916415:1180-nf] \"Seek ye,\" says he, \"the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you\"-by himself, of course. But if by himself, what sort of being is he, who shall bestow the things of another? If by the Creator, whose all things are, then who[fn-65-P6504_1916686:1181-nf] is he that promises what belongs to another? If these things are \"additions\" to the kingdom, they must be placed in the second rank;[fn-65-P6505_1916836:1182-nf] and the second rank belongs to Him to whom the first also does; His are the food and raiment, whose is the kingdom. Thus to the Creator belongs the entire promise, the full reality[fn-65-P6506_1917041:1183-nf] of its parables, the perfect equalization[fn-65-P6507_1917100:1184-nf] of its similitudes; for these have respect to none other than Him to whom they have a parity of relation in every point.[fn-65-P6508_1917243:1185-nf] We are servants because we have a Lord in our God. We ought \"to have our loins girded: \"[fn-65-P6509_1917368:1186-nf] in other words, we are to be free from the embarrassments of a perplexed and much occupied life; \"to have our lights burning,\"[fn-65-P6510_1917518:1187-nf] that is, our minds kindled by faith, and resplendent with the works of truth. And thus \"to wait for our Lord,\"[fn-65-P6511_1917652:1188-nf] that is, Christ. Whence \"returning? \"If \"from the wedding,\" He is the Christ of the Creator, for the wedding is His. If He is not the Creator's, not even Marcion himself would have gone to the wedding, although invited, for in his god he discovers one who hates the nuptial bed. The parable would therefore have failed in the person of the Lord, if He were not a Being to whom a wedding is consistent. In the next parable also he makes a flagrant mistake, when he assigns to the person of the Creator that \"thief, whose hour, if the father of the family had only known, he would not have suffered his house to be broken through.\"[fn-65-P6512_1918305:1189-nf] How can the Creator wear in any way the aspect of a thief, Lord as He is of all mankind?

For like as the grace flows down in an unbroken stream from the Father, through the Son and the Spirit, upon the persons worthy of it, so does this profanity return backward, and is transmitted from the Son to the God of all the world, passing from one to the other.

For it was in the law, that whoever should refuse marriage should put off his shoe, but that he should be shod who was to be the bridegroom: \"And it happened, when Jesus was in Jericho, he looked around with his eyes, and saw a man standing before his face, and holding a javelin[fn-83-P8306_2744119:246-nf] in his hand, and said, Art thou for us or for our enemies?

And Moses said, I will pass over and see this great sight, why the bush is not consumed. But when He saw that he drew near to see, the Lord God called him from the bush, saying, Moses, Moses. And he said, What is it? And He said, Draw not nigh hither, unless thou hast loosed thy shoe from off thy feet; for the place on which thou standest is holy ground.

They ask of me now a righteous judgment, and desire to approach to God, saying, What! because we have fasted, and Thou hast not seen: we have humiliated our souls, and Thou hast not known. For in the days of fasting are found your own wills; for either ye torment those who are subjected to you, or ye fast for strifes and judgments, or ye strike your neighbours with fists. For what do you fast unto me, that to-day your voice should be heard in clamour? This fast I have not chosen, save that a man should humble his soul.

Even as thou hast, my son, so do: if thou hast abundant substance, give the more alms therefrom; if thou hast little, communicate even of that little.

Then shall the King say unto them that are on His right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, receive the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world.

St. Ambrose also, though dealing with a question of very great importance, the equality of the Holy Spirit with the Father and the Son, employs the subdued style, because the object he has in view demands, not beauty of diction, nor the swaying of the mind by the stir of emotion, but facts and proofs. Accordingly, in the introduction to his work, we find the following passage among others: \"When Gideon was startled by the message he had heard from God, that, though thousands of the people failed, yet through one man God would driver His people from their enemies, he brought forth a kid of the goats, and by direction of the angel laid it with unleavened cakes upon a rock, and poured the broth over it; and as soon as the angel of God touched it with the end of the staff that was in his hand, there rose up fire out of the rock and consumed the offering.[fn-54-P5435_2883957:60-nf] Now this sign seems to indicate that the rock was a type of the body of Christ, for it is written, `They: drank of that spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ;'[fn-54-P5436_2884162:61-nf] this, of course, referring not to Christ's divine nature but to His flesh, whose ever-flowing fountain of blood has ever satisfied the hearts of His thirsting people. And so it was at that time declared in a mystery that the Lord Jesus, when crucified, should abolish in His flesh the sins of the whole world, and not their guilty acts merely, but the evil lusts of their hearts. For the kid's flesh refers to the guilt of the outward act, the broth to the allurement of lust within, as it is written, 'And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting; and the children of Israel also wept again and again and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?[fn-54-P5437_2884838:62-nf] When the angel, then, stretched out his staff and with the Spirit of God, should burn up all the sins of the human race. Whence also the lord says 'I am come to send fire on the earth.\"[fn-54-P5438_2885041:63-nf] And in the same style he pursues the subject, devoting himself chiefly to proving and enforcing his point.[fn-54-P5439_2885167:64-nf] ","title":"Book IV","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":12,"verse":49,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_35_book_xxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"95","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"93. It requires closer examination to see the meaning of the first action of Moses in burning the calf in fire, and grinding it to powder, and sprinkling it in the water for the people to drink. The tables given to him, written with the finger of God, that is, by the agency of the Holy Spirit, he may have broken, because he judged the people unworthy of having them read to them; and he may have burned the calf, and ground it, and scattered it so as to be carried away by the water, in order to let nothing of it remain among the people. But why should he have made them drink it? Every one must feel anxious to discover the typical significance of this action. Pursuing the inquiry, we may find that in the calf there was an embodiment of the devil, as there is in men of all nations who have the devil as their head or leader in their impious rites. The calf is gold, because there is a semblance of wisdom in the institution of idolatrous worship. Of this the apostle says, \"Knowing God, they glorified Him not as God, nor were thankful; but they became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise they became foolish, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of corruptible man, and of birds, and of four-footed beasts, and of creeping things.\"[fn-22-P2297_1383546:186-nf] From this so-called wisdom came the golden calf, which was one of the forms of idolatry among the chief men and professed sages of Egypt. The calf, then, represents every body or society of Gentile idolaters. This impious society the Lord Christ burns with that fire of which He says in the Gospel, \"I am come to send fire on the earth;\"[fn-22-P2298_1383906:187-nf] for, as there is nothing hid from His heat,[fn-22-P2299_1383971:188-nf] when the Gentiles believe in Him they lose the form of the devil in the fire of divine influence. Then all the body is ground, that is, after the dissolution of the combination in the membership of iniquity comes humiliation under the word of truth. Then the dust is sprinkled in the water, that the Israelites, that is, the preachers of the gospel, may in baptism admit those formerly idolaters into their own body, that is, the body of Christ. To Peter, who was one of those Israelites, it was said of the Gentiles, \"Kill, and eat.\"[fn-23-P2300_1384525:189-nf] To kill and eat is much the same as to grind and drink. So this calf, by the fire of zeal, and the keen penetration of the word, and the water of baptism, was swallowed up by the people, instead of their being swallowed up by it.","title":"Book XXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":12,"verse":49,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_125_oration_concerning_simeon_and_anna","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"ANF-06","text":"XIII.

Hail, thou city most happy, for glorious things are spoken of thee; thy priest shall be clothed with righteousness, and thy saints shall shout for joy, and thy poor shall be satisfied with bread.[fn-61-P6132_1885327:112-nf] Hail! rejoice, O Jerusalem, for the Lord reigneth in the midst of thee.[fn-61-P6133_1885450:113-nf] That Lord, I say, who in His simple and immaterial Deity, entered our nature, and of the virgin's womb became ineffably incarnate; that Lord, who was partaker of nothing else save the lump of Adam, who was by the serpent tripped up. For the Lord laid not hold of the seed of angels[fn-61-P6134_1885752:114-nf] -those, I say, who fell not away from that beauteous order and rank that was assigned to them from the beginning. To us He condescended, that Word who was always with the Father co-existent God. Nor, again, did He come into the world to restore; nor will He restore, as has been imagined by some impious advocates of the devil, those wicked demons who once fell from light; but when the Creator and Framer of all things had, as the most divine Paul says, laid hold of the seed of Abraham, and through him of the whole human race, He was made man for ever, and without change, in order that by His fellowship with us, and our joining on to Him, the ingress of sin into us might be stopped, its strength being broken by degrees, and itself as wax being melted, by that fire which the Lord, when He came, sent upon the earth.[fn-61-P6135_1886595:115-nf] Hail to thee, thou Catholic Church,[fn-61-P6136_1886652:116-nf] which hast been planted in all the earth, and do thou rejoice with us. Fear not, little flock, the storms of the enemy[fn-61-P6137_1886886:117-nf] for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom, and that you should tread upon the necks of your enemies.[fn-61-P6138_1887158:118-nf] Hail, and rejoice, thou that wast once barren, and without seed unto godliness, but who hast now many children of faith,[fn-61-P6139_1887301:119-nf] Hail, thou people of the Lord, thou chosen generation, thou royal priesthood, thou holy nation, thou peculiar people-show forth His praises who hath called you out of darkness into His marvellous light; and for His mercies glorify Him.[fn-61-P6140_1887557:120-nf] ","title":"Oration Concerning Simeon and Anna","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":12,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_34_homily_xxviii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"28","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"Nor indeed is it possible for a soul, torn away from the body, to wander here any more.

It is of His last baptism, as some hold, that He speaks in the words,[fn-68-P6894_1288979:126-nf] \"I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how am I straitened till it be accomplished? \"And it agrees with this that the disciple John speaks in his Epistle[fn-68-P6895_1289158:127-nf] of the Spirit, and the water, and the blood, as being one. And again He declares Himself to be the way and the door, but clearly He is not the door to those to whom He is the way, and He is no longer the way to those to whom He is the door. All those, then, who are being initiated in the beginning of the oracles of God, and come to the voice of him who cries in the wilderness, \"Make straight the way of the Lord,\" the voice which sounds beyond Jordan at the house of preparation, let them prepare themselves so that they may be in a state to receive the spiritual word, brought home to them by the enlightenment of the Spirit. As we are now, as our subject requires, bringing together all that relates to the Jordan, let us look at the \"river.\" God, by Moses, carried the people through the Red Sea, making the water a wall for them on the right hand and on the left, and by Joshua He carried them through Jordan. Now, Paul deals with this Scripture, and his warfare is not according to the flesh of it, for he knew that the law is spiritual in a spiritual sense. And he shows us that he understood what is said about the passage of the Red Sea; for he says in his first Epistle to the Corinthians,[fn-68-P6896_1290380:128-nf] \"I would not, brethren, have you ignorant, how that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and did all eat the same spiritual meat, and drink the same spiritual drink; for they drank of the spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ.\" In the spirit of this passage let us also pray that we may receive from God to understand the spiritual meaning of Joshua's passage through Jordan. Of it, also, Paul would have said, \"I would not, brethren, have you ignorant, that all our fathers went through Jordan, and were all baptized into Jesus in the spirit and in the river.\" And Joshua, who succeeded Moses, was a type of Jesus Christ, who succeeds the dispensation through the law, and replaces it by the preaching of the Gospel. And even if those Paul speaks of were baptized in the cloud and in the sea, there is something harsh and salt in their baptism. They are still in fear of their enemies, and crying to the Lord and to Moses, saying,[fn-68-P6897_1291444:129-nf] \"Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou brought us forth to slay us in the wilderness? Why hast thou dealt thus with us, to bring us forth out of Egypt? \"But the baptism to Joshua, which takes place in quite sweet and drinkable water, is in many ways superior to that earlier one, religion having by this time grown clearer and assuming a becoming order. For the ark of the covenant of the Lord our God is carried in procession by the priests and levites, the people following the ministers of God, it, also, accepting the law of holiness. For Joshua says to the people,[fn-68-P6898_1292048:130-nf] \"Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow; the Lord will do wonders among you.\" And he commands the priests to go before the people with the ark of the covenant, wherein is plainly showed forth the mystery of the Father's economy about the Son, which is highly exalted by Him who gave the Son this office; \"That at the name of Jesus[fn-68-P6899_1292398:131-nf] every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.\" This is pointed out by what we find in the book called Joshua,[fn-69-P6900_1292675:132-nf] \"In that day I will begin to exalt thee before the children of Israel.\" And we hear our Lord Jesus saying to the children of Israel,[fn-69-P6901_1292823:133-nf] \"Come hither and hear the words of the Lord your God. Hereby ye shall know that the living God is in (among) you; \"for when we are baptized to Jesus, we know that the living God is in us. And, in the former case, they kept the passover in Egypt, and then began their journey, but with Joshua, after crossing Jordan on the tenth day of the first month they pitched their camp in Galgala; for a sheep had to be procured before invitations could be issued to the banquet after Joshua's baptism. Then the children of Israel, since the children of those who came out of Egypt had not received circumcision, were circumcised by Joshua with a very sharp stone; the Lord declares that He takes away the reproach of Egypt on the day of Joshua's baptism, when Joshua purified the children of Israel. For it is written:[fn-69-P6902_1293657:134-nf] \"And the Lord said to Joshua, the son of Nun, This day have I taken away the reproach of Egypt from off you.\" Then the children of Israel kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month, with much greater gladness than in Egypt, for they ate unleavened bread of the corn of the holy land, and fresh food better than manna. For when they received the land of promise God did not entertain them with scantier food, nor when such a one as Joshua was their leader do they get inferior bread. This will be plain to him who thinks of the true holy land and of the Jerusalem above. Hence it is written in this same Gospel:[fn-69-P6903_1294297:135-nf] Your fathers did eat bread in the wilderness, and are dead; he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever. For the manna, though it was given by God, yet was bread of travel, bread supplied to those still under discipline, well fitted for those who were under tutors and governors. And the new bread Joshua managed to get from corn they cut in the country, in the land of promise, others having laboured and his disciples reaping,-that was bread more full of life, distributed as it was to those who, for their perfection, were able to receive the inheritance of their fathers. Hence, he who is still under discipline to that bread may receive death as far as it is concerned, but he who has attained to the bread that follows that, eating it, shall live for ever. All this has been added, not, I conceive, without appropriateness, to our study of the baptism at the Jordan, administered by John at Bethabara.","title":"Sixth Book","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":12,"verse":47,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_40_a_treatise_on_grace_and_free_will_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"65","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"The excuse such as men are in the habit of alleging from ignorance is taken away from those persons who know God's commandments. But neither will those be without punishment who know not the law of God. \"For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law; and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law.\"[fn-59-P5935_2319280:38-nf] Now the apostle does not appear to me to have said this as if he meant that they would have to suffer something worse who in their sins are ignorant of the law than they who know it. [III.] It is seemingly worse, no doubt, \"to perish\" than \"to be judged;\" but inasmuch as he was speaking of the Gentiles and of the Jews when he used these words, because the former were without the law, but the latter had received the law, who can venture to say that the Jews who sin in the law will not perish, since they refused to believe in Christ, when it was of them that the apostle said, \"They shall be judged by the law\"? For without faith in Christ no man can be delivered; and therefore they will be so judged that they perish. If, indeed, the condition of those who are ignorant of the law of God is worse than the condition of those who know it, how can that be true which the Lord says in the gospel: \"The servant who knows not his lord's will, and commits things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes; whereas the servant who knows his lord's will, and commits things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with many stripes \"?[fn-59-P5936_2320437:39-nf] Observe how clearly He here shows that it is a graver matter for a man to sin with knowledge than in ignorance. And yet we must not on this account betake ourselves for refuge to the shades of ignorance, with the view of finding our excuse therein.

For it was not said without reason: \"Pour out Thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known Thee;\"[fn-59-P5938_2321384:41-nf] nor again according to what the apostle says: \"When He shall come from heaven in a flame of fire to take vengeance on them that know not God.\"[fn-59-P5939_2321545:42-nf] But yet in order that we may have that knowledge that will prevent our saying, each one of us, \"I did not know,\" \"I did not hear,\" \"I did not understand;\" the human will is summoned, in such words as these: \"Wish not to be as the horse or as the mule, which have no understanding;\"[fn-59-P5940_2321850:43-nf] although it may show itself even worse, of which it is written, \"A stubborn servant will not be reproved by words; for even if he understand, yet he will not obey.\"[fn-59-P5941_2322034:44-nf] But when a man says, \"I cannot do what I am commanded, because I am mastered by my concupiscence,\" he has no longer any excuse to plead from ignorance, nor reason to blame God in his heart, but he recognises and laments his own evil in himself; and still to such an one the apostle says: \"Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good;\"[fn-59-P5942_2322399:45-nf] and of course the very fact that the injunction, \"Consent not to be overcome,\" is addressed to him, undoubtedly summons the determination of his will.

You say `he is the universal cause of sin;' and, while you make him the author of all crimes, you free men from fault, and take away the freedom of the will. Our Lord says that[fn-92-P9259_2491178:11-nf] `from our heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnesses, railings,' and of Judas we read in the Gospel;[fn-92-P9260_2491346:12-nf] \"After the sop Satan entered into him,\" that is, because he had before the sop sinned voluntarily, and had not been brought to repentance either by humbling himself or by the forbearance of the Saviour. So also the Apostle says;[fn-92-P9261_2491595:13-nf] \"Such men I delivered to Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.\" He delivered to Satan as to a torturer, with a view to their punishment, those who, before they had been delivered to him learned to blaspheme by their own will. David also draws the distinction in a few words between the faults due to his own will and the incentives of vice when he says[fn-92-P9262_2491981:14-nf] \"Cleanse thou me from my secret faults, and keep back thy servant from alien sins.\" We read also in Ecclesiastes[fn-92-P9263_2492131:15-nf] \"If the spirit of a ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place;\" from which we may clearly see that we commit sin if we give opportunity to the power which rises up, and if we fail to hurl down headlong the enemy who is scaling our walls. As to your threatening your brothers, that is, those who accuse you, with eternal fire in company with the devil, it seems to me that you do not so much drag your brethren down as raise the devil up, since he, according to you, is to be punished only with the same fires as Christian men. But you well know, I think, what eternal fires mean according to the ideas of Origen, namely, the sinners' conscience, and the remorse which galls their hearts within. These ideas he thinks are intended in the words of Isaiah:[fn-92-P9264_2492908:16-nf] \"Their worm shall not die neither shall their fire be quenched.\" And in the words addressed to Babylon:[fn-92-P9265_2493031:17-nf] \"Thou hast coals of fire, thou shalt sit upon them, these shall be thy help.\" So also in the Psalm it is said to the penitent;[fn-92-P9266_2493420:18-nf] \"What shall be given to thee, or what shall be done more for thee against thee false tongue? Sharp arrows of the mighty, with desolating coals;\" which means (according to him) that the arrows of God's precepts (concerning which the Prophet says in another place,[fn-92-P9267_2493718:19-nf] \"I lived in misery while a thorn pierces me\") should wound and strike through the crafty tongue, and make an end of sins in it. He also interprets the place where the Lord testifies saying:[fn-92-P9268_2493970:20-nf] \"I came to send fire on the earth, and how I wish that it may burn\" as meaning \"I wish that all may repent, and burn out through the Holy spirit their vices and their sins; for I am he of whom it is written,[fn-92-P9269_2494197:21-nf] \"Our God is a consuming fire;\" it is no great thing then to say this of the devil, since it is prepared also for men.\" You ought rather to have said, if you wished to avoid the suspicion of believing in the salvation of the devil;[fn-92-P9270_2494461:22-nf] \"Thou hast become perdition and shalt not be for ever;\" and as the Lord speaks to Job concerning the devil,[fn-92-P9271_2494600:23-nf] \"Behold his hope shall fail him and in the sight of all shall he be cast down. I will not arouse him as one that is cruel, for who can resist my countenance? Who has first given to me that I may return it to him? for all things beneath the heaven are mine. I will not spare him and his words that are powerful and fashioned to turn away wrath.\" Hence, these things may pass as the work of a plain man.

What, therefore, is the business of Patience in the body? In the first place, it is the affliction[fn-123-P12370_3456965:139-nf] of the flesh-a victim[fn-123-P12371_3457028:140-nf] able to appease the Lord by means of the sacrifice of humiliation-in making a libation to the Lord of sordid[fn-123-P12372_3457191:141-nf] raiment, together with scantiness of food, content with simple diet and the pure drink of water[fn-123-P12373_3457331:142-nf] in con joining fasts to all this; in inuring herself to sackcloth and ashes. This bodily patience adds a grace to our prayers for good, a strength to our prayers against evil; this opens the ears of Christ our God,[fn-123-P12374_3457799:143-nf] dissipates severity, elicits clemency. Thus that Babylonish king,[fn-123-P12375_3457885:144-nf] after being exiled from human form in his seven years' squalor and neglect., because he had offended the Lord; by the bodily immolation of patience not only recovered his kingdom, but-what is more to be desired by a man-made satisfaction to God. Further, if we set down in order the higher and happier grades of bodily patience, (we find that)it is she who is entrusted by holiness with the care of continence of the flesh: she keeps the widow,[fn-123-P12376_3458441:145-nf] and sets on the virgin the seal[fn-123-P12377_3458520:146-nf] and raises the self-made eunuch to the realms of heaven.[fn-123-P12378_3458604:147-nf] That which springs from a virtue of the mind is perfected in the flesh; and, finally, by the patience of the flesh, does battle under persecution. If flight press hard, the flesh wars with[fn-123-P12379_3458815:148-nf] the inconvenience of flight; if imprisonment overtake[fn-123-P12380_3459159:149-nf] us, the flesh (still was) in bonds, the flesh in the gyve, the flesh in solitude,[fn-123-P12381_3459303:150-nf] and in that want of light, and in that patience of the world's misusage.[fn-123-P12382_3459389:151-nf] When, however, it is led forth unto the final proof of happiness,[fn-123-P12383_3459481:152-nf] unto the occasion of the second baptism,[fn-123-P12384_3459545:153-nf] unto the act of ascending the divine seat, no patience is more needed there than bodily patience.

I see that you are now wishing to hear, since it is not every blasphemy of the Spirit, what that blasphemy is which shall not be forgiven, and what that word is, since it is not every word which if it shall be spoken against the Holy Ghost, shall not be forgiven neither in this world, neither in the world to come. And for my part I should be willing to tell you at once,what you are so very intently waiting to hear; but bear for a while the delay which a more careful diligence requires, till by the Lord's assistance I shall unfold the whole meaning of the passage before us. Now the other two Evangelists, Mark and Luke, when they spake of the same thing, did not say \"blasphemy\" or \"a word,\" that we might understand it not of every blasphemy, but of some sort of blasphemy; not every word, but some certain word. What then did they say? In Mark it is thus written, \"Verily I say unto you, all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies, where-withsoever they shall blaspheme. But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, hath never forgiveness, but shall be held guilty of an eternal offence.\"[fn-39-P3910_1694991:30-nf] In Luke it is thus: \"And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him; but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven.\"[fn-39-P3911_1695278:31-nf] Is there any departure from the truth of the same proposition because of some diversity in the expression? For indeed there is no other reason why the Evangelists do not relate the same things in the same way, but that we may learn thereby to prefer things to words, not words to things, and to seek for nothing else in the speaker, but for his intention, to convey which only the words are used. For what real difference is there whether it is said, \"Blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be forgiven;\" or \"he that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him.\" Except perhaps that the same thing is declared more plainly in this last than in the other form; and so one Evangelist does not overthrow, but explains the other. Now \"blasphemy of the Spirit\" is an unevident[fn-39-P3912_1696085:32-nf] expression; because it is not directly said what spirit; for every spirit is not the Holy Spirit. Thus it might be called \"blasphemy of the spirit,\" when a man blasphemes with the spirit; as that may be called \"prayer of the spirit,\" when one prays with the spirit. Whence the Apostle says, \"I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also.\"[fn-39-P3913_1696472:33-nf] But when it is said, \"he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost,\" these ambiguities are removed. So the expression, \"hath never forgiveness, but shall be held guilty of an eternal offence; \"what is it, but what according to Matthew is expressed, \"it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come\"? The very same idea is expressed in different words and different forms of speech. And what is in Matthew, \"Whosoever speaketh a word against the Holy Ghost,\" that we might not understand it of anything but blasphemy, others have more clearly expressed, \"He that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost.\" Yet the same thing is said by all; nor did any one of them depart from the intention of the Speaker, for the sake of understanding which only are words spoken, and written, and read, and heard.","title":"Sermon XXI.

First then in order to our receiving eternal life which shall be given at the last, there comes to us a gift from God's goodness from the beginning of our faith, to wit, the remission of sins. For while they remain, there remains in some sort enmity against God, and alienation from Him, which comes from what is evil in us; since Scripture does not speak falsely, which says, \"Your sins separate between you and God.\"[fn-39-P3945_1705645:59-nf] He does not then bestow on us His good things, except He take away our evil things. And the former increase in proportion as the latter are diminished; nor will the one be perfected, till the other be brought to an end. But now that the Lord Jesus forgives sins by the Holy Ghost, just as by the Holy Ghost He casts out devils, may be understood by this, that after His Resurrection from the dead, when He had said to His disciples, \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost,\" He immediately subjoined, \"Whosesoever sins ye remit, they shall be remitted unto them, and whosesoever sins ye retain, they shall be retained.\"[fn-39-P3946_1706270:60-nf] For that regeneration also, in which there is a remission of all past sins, is wrought by the Holy Ghost, as the Lord saith, \"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\"[fn-39-P3947_1706509:61-nf] But it is one thing to be born of the Spirit, another to be nourished by the Spirit; just as it is one thing to be born of the flesh, which happens when the mother is delivered of her child; another to be nourished by the flesh, which happens when she gives suck to her infant, who turns himself that he may drink with pleasure thither whence he was born, to have life; that he may receive the support of life from thence, whence he received the beginning of his birth. We must believe then that the first blessing of God's goodness in the Holy Ghost is the remission of sins. Whence the preaching of John the Baptist, who was sent as the forerunner of the Lord, also begins with it. For thus it is written, \"In those days came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, saying, Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\"[fn-39-P3948_1707369:62-nf] Hence too the beginning of our Lord's preaching, as we read, \"From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\"[fn-39-P3949_1707549:63-nf] Now John, amongst the other things which he spake tothose who came to be baptized by him, said, \"I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.\"[fn-39-P3950_1707856:64-nf] The Lord also said, \"John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence,\"[fn-39-P3951_1707996:65-nf] even at Pentecost. Now as to John's expression, \"with fire,\" though tribulation also might be understood, which believers were to suffer for the name of Christ; yet may we reasonably think that the same Holy Spirit is signified also under the name of \"fire.\"[fn-39-P3952_1708271:66-nf] Wherefore when He came it is said, \"And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.\"[fn-39-P3953_1708468:67-nf] Hence also the Lord Himself said, \"I am come to send fire on the earth.\"[fn-39-P3954_1708558:68-nf] Hence also the Apostle saith, \"Fervent in the spirit;\"[fn-39-P3955_1708632:69-nf] for from Him comes the fervour of love. \"For it is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.\"[fn-39-P3956_1708772:70-nf] And the contrary to this fervour is what the Lord said, \"The love of many shall wax cold.\"[fn-39-P3957_1708879:71-nf] Now perfect love is the perfect gift of the Holy Spirit. But the first \"gift\" is that which is concerned with the remission of sins; by which blessing \"we are delivered from the power of darkness;\"[fn-39-P3958_1709098:72-nf] and the prince of this world,[fn-39-P3959_1709145:73-nf] who worketh in the children of disobedience\"[fn-39-P3960_1709209:74-nf] by no other power than the fellowship and the bond of sin, is \"cast out\" by our faith.

Whosoever therefore shall be guilty of impenitence against the Spirit, in whom the unity and fellowship of the communion of the Church is gathered together, shall never have forgiveness; because he has stopped the source of forgiveness against himself, and deservedly shall he be condemned with the spirit, which is divided against himself, who is himself also divided against the Holy Spirit which is not divided against Himself. And of this the very testimonies of the Gospel warn us, would we with good attention search them. For according to Luke the Lord does not say, \"That he who blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven:\" in that place where He is answering those who said that He cast out devils by the prince of the devils.

That the whole creation shall, according to God's will, obtain a vast increase, that it may bring forth and sustain fruits such [as we have mentioned], Isaiah declares: \"And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every prominent hill, water running everywhere in that day, when many shall perish, when walls shall fall. And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, seven times that of the day, when He shall heal the anguish of His people, and do away with the pain of His stroke.\"[fn-93-P9378_2749511:304-nf] Now \"the pain of the stroke\" means that inflicted at the beginning upon disobedient man in Adam, that is, death; which [stroke] the Lord will heal when He raises us from the dead, and restores the inheritance of the fathers, as Isaiah again says: \"And thou shall be confident in the Lord, and He will cause thee to pass over the whole earth, and feed thee with the inheritance of Jacob thy father.\"[fn-93-P9379_2749935:305-nf] This is what the Lord declared: \"Happy are those servants whom the Lord when He cometh shall find watching.

Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses be without men, and the earth be left a desert. And after these things the Lord shall remove us men far away (longe nos faciet Deus homines), and those who shall remain shall multiply upon the earth.\"[fn-93-P9382_2750934:308-nf] Then Daniel also says this very thing: \"And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of those under the heaven, is given to the saints of the Most High God, whose kingdom is everlasting, and all dominions shall serve and obey Him.\"[fn-93-P9383_2751189:309-nf] And lest the promise named should be understood as referring to this time, it was declared to the prophet: \"And come thou, and stand in thy lot at the consummation of the days.\"[fn-93-P9384_2751388:310-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":12,"verse":33,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_63_book_iv_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"82","folder":"ANF-02","text":"The conversion, however, which leads to divine things, the Stoics say, is affected by a change, the soul being changed to wisdom. And Plato: \"On the soul taking a turn to what is better, and a change from a kind of nocturnal day.\" Now the philosophers also allow the good man an exit from life in accordance with reason, in the case of one depriving him of active exertion, so that the hope of action is no longer left him. And the judge who compels us to deny Him whom we love, I regard as showing who is and who is not the friend of God. In that case there is not left ground for even examining what one prefers-the menaces of man or the love of God. And abstinence from vicious acts is found, somehow, [to result in] the diminution and extinction of vicious propensities, their energy being destroyed by inaction. And this is the import of \"Sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and come, follow Me\"[fn-66-P6685_2035299:28-nf] -that is, follow what is said by the Lord. Some say that by what \"thou hast\" He designated the things in the soul, of a nature not akin to it, though how these are bestowed on the poor they are not able to say. For God dispenses to all according to desert, His distribution being righteous. Despising, therefore, the possessions which God apportions to thee in thy magnificence, comply with what is spoken by me; haste to the ascent of the Spirit, being not only justified by abstinence from what is evil, but in addition also perfected, by Christlike beneficence.[fn-66-P6686_2035902:29-nf] In this instance He convicted the man, who boasted that he had fulfilled the injunctions of the law, of not loving his neighbour; and it is by beneficence that the love which, according to the gnostic ascending scale, is Lord of the Sabbath, proclaims itself.[fn-66-P6687_2036187:30-nf] We must then, according to my view, have recourse to the word of salvation neither from fear of punishment nor promise of a gift, but on account of the good itself. Such, as do so, stand on the right hand of the sanctuary; but those who think that by the gift of what is perishable they shall receive in exchange what belongs to immortality are in the parable of the two brothers called \"hirelings.\" And is there not some light thrown here on the expression \"in the likeness and image,\" in the fact that some live according to the likeness of Christ, while those who stand on the left hand live according to their image? Thereare then two things proceeding from the truth, one root lying beneath both,-the choice being, however, not equal, or rather the difference that is in the choice not being equal. To choose by way of imitation differs, as appears to me, from the choice of him who chooses according to knowledge, as that which is set on fire differs from that which is illuminated. Israel, then, is the light of the likeness which is according to the Scripture. But the image is another thing. What means the parable of Lazarus, by showing the image of the rich and poor? And what the saying, \"No man can serve two masters, God and Mammon? \"-the Lord so terming the love of money. For instance, the covetous, who were invited, responded not to the invitation to the supper, not because of their possessing property, but of their inordinate affection to what they possessed. \"The foxes,\" then, have holes. He called those evil and earthly men who are occupied about the wealth which is mined and dug from the ground, foxes. Thus also, in reference to Herod: \"Go, tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and perform cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.\"[fn-66-P6688_2038149:31-nf] For He applied the name \"fowls of the air\" to those who were distinct from the other birds-those really pure, those that have the power of flying to the knowledge of the heavenly Word. For not riches only, but also honour, and marriage, and poverty, have ten thousand cares for him who is unfit for them.[fn-66-P6689_2038474:32-nf] And those cares He indicated in the parable of the fourfold seed, when He said that \"the seed of the word which fell unto the thorns\" and hedges was choked by them, and could not bring forth fruit. It is therefore necessary to learn how to make use of every occurrence, so as by a good life, according to knowledge, to be trained for the state of eternal life. For it said, \"I saw the wicked exalted and towering as the cedars of Lebanon; and I passed,\" says the Scripture, \"and, lo, he was not; and I sought him, and his place was not found. Keep innocence, and look on uprightness: for there is a remnant to the man of peace.\"[fn-66-P6690_2039123:33-nf] Such will he be who believes unfeignedly with his whole heart, and is tranquil in his whole soul. \"For the different people honour me with their lips, but their heart is far from the Lord.\"[fn-66-P6691_2039337:34-nf] \"They bless with their mouth, but they curse in their heart.\"[fn-66-P6692_2039442:35-nf] \"They loved Him with their mouth, and lied to Him with their tongue; but their heart was not right with Him, and they were not faithful to His covenant.\" Wherefore \"let the false lips become speechless, and let the Lord destroy the boastful tongue: those who say, We shall magnify our tongue, and our lips are our own; who is Lord over us? For the affliction of the poor and the groaning of the needy now will I arise, saith the Lord; I will set him in safety; I will speak out in his case.\"[fn-66-P6693_2039952:36-nf] For it is to the humble that Christ belongs, who do not exalt themselves against His flock. \"Lay not up for yourselves, therefore, treasures on the earth, where moth and rust destroy, and thieves break through and steal,\"[fn-66-P6694_2040193:37-nf] says the Lord, in reproach perchance of the covetous, and perchance also of those who are simply anxious and full of cares, and those too who indulge their bodies. For amours, and diseases, and evil thoughts \"break through\" the mind and the whole man. But our true \"treasure\" is where what is allied to our mind is, since it bestows the communicative power of righteousness, showing that we must assign to the habit of our old conversation what we have acquired by it, and have recourse to God, beseeching mercy. He is, in truth, \"the bag that waxeth not old,\" the provisions of eternal life, \"the treasure that faileth not in heaven.\"[fn-66-P6695_2040848:38-nf] \"For I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,\"[fn-66-P6696_2040918:39-nf] saith the Lord. And they say those things to those who wish to be poor for righteousness' sake. For they have heard in the commandment that \"the broad and wide way leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in by it.\"[fn-66-P6697_2041161:40-nf] It is not of anything else that the assertion is made, but of profligacy, and love of women, and love of glory, and ambition, and similar passions. For so He says, \"Fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee; and whose shall those things be which thou hast prepared? \"[fn-66-P6698_2041459:41-nf] And the commandment is expressed in these very words, \"Take heed, therefore, of covetousness. For a man's life does not consist in the abundance of those things which he possesses. For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? \"[fn-66-P6699_2041801:42-nf] \"Wherefore I say, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for your body, what ye shall put on. For your life is more than meat, and your body than raiment.\"[fn-67-P6700_2041996:43-nf] And again, \"For your Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.\" \"But seek first the kingdom of heaven, and its righteousness,\" for these are the great things, and the things which are small and appertain to this life \"shall be added to you.\"[fn-67-P6701_2042286:44-nf] Does He not plainly then exhort us to follow the gnostic life, and enjoin us to seek the truth in word and deed? Therefore Christ, who trains the soul, reckons one rich, not by his gifts, but by his choice. It is said, therefore, that Zaccheus, or, according to some, Matthew, the chief of the publicans, on hearing that the Lord had deigned to come to him, said, \"Lord, and if I have taken anything by false accusation, I restore him fourfold; \"on which the Saviour said, \"The Son of man, on coming to-day, has found that which was lost.\"[fn-67-P6702_2042866:45-nf] Again, on seeing the rich cast into the treasury according to their wealth, and the widow two mites, He said \"that the widow had cast in more than they all,\" for \"they had contributed of their abundance, but she of her destitution.\" And because He brought all things to bear on the discipline of the soul, He said, \"Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.\"[fn-67-P6703_2043264:46-nf] And the meek are those who have quelled the battle of unbelief in the soul, the battle of wrath, and lust, and the other forms that are subject to them. And He praises those meek by choice, not by necessity. For there are with the Lord both rewards and\" many mansions,\" corresponding to men's lives. \"Whosoever shall receive,\" says He, \"a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward; and whosoever shall receive a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward; and whoso shall receive one of the least of these my disciples, shall not lose his reward.\"[fn-67-P6704_2043896:47-nf] And again, the differences of virtue according to merit, and the noble rewards, He indicated by the hours unequal in number; and in addition, by the equal reward given to each of the labourers-that is, salvation, which is meant by the penny-He indicated the equality of justice; and the difference of those called He intimated, by those who worked for unequal portions of time. They shall work, therefore, in accordance with the appropriate mansions of which they have been deemed worthy as rewards, being fellow-workers in the ineffable administration and service.[fn-67-P6705_2044484:48-nf] \"Those, then,\" says Plato, \"who seem called to a holy life, are those who, freed and released from those earthly localities as from prisons, have reached the pure dwelling-place on high.\" In clearer terms again he expresses the same thing: \"Those who by philosophy have been sufficiently purged from those things, live without bodies entirely for all time. Although they are enveloped in certain shapes; in the case of some, of air, and others, of fire.\" He adds further: \"And they reach abodes fairer than those, which it is not easy, nor is there sufficient time now to describe.\" Whence with reason, \"blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted; \"[fn-67-P6706_2045253:49-nf] for they who have repented of their former evil life shall attain to\"the calling\" (klh=sin), for this is the meaning of being comforted (paraklhqh=nai). And there are two styles of penitents.[fn-67-P6707_2045462:50-nf] That which is more common is fear on account of what is done; but the other which is more special, the shame which the spirit feels in itself arising from conscience. Whether then, here or elsewhere (for no place is devoid of the beneficence of God), He again says, \"Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.\" And mercy is not, as some of the philosophers have imagined, pain on account of others' calamities, but rather something good, as the prophets say. For it is said, \"I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.\"[fn-67-P6708_2046183:51-nf] And He[fn-67-P6709_2046229:52-nf] means by the merciful, not only those who do acts of mercy, but those who wish to do them, though they be not able; who do as far as purpose is concerned. For sometimes we wish by the gift of money or by personal effort to do mercy, as to assist one in want, or help one who is sick, or stand by one who is in any emergency; and are not able either from poverty, or disease, or old age (for this also is natural disease), to carry out our purpose, in reference to the things to which we are impelled, being unable to conduct them to the end we wished. Those, who have entertained the wish whose purpose is equal, share in the same honour with those who have the ability, although others have the advantage in point of resources.[fn-67-P6710_2046980:53-nf] And since there are two paths of reaching the perfection of salvation, works and knowledge, He called the\"pure in heart blessed, for they shall see God.\"[fn-67-P6711_2047230:54-nf] And if we really look to the truth of the matter, knowledge is the purification of the leading faculty of the soul, and is a good activity. Some things accordingly are good in themselves, and others by participation in what is good, as we say good actions are good. But without things intermediate which hold the place of material, neither good nor bad actions are constituted, such I mean as life, and health, and other necessary things or circumstantials. Pure then as respects corporeal lusts, and pure in respect of holy thoughts, he means those are, who attain to the knowledge of God, when the chief faculty of the soul has nothing spurious to stand in the way of its power. When, therefore, he who partakes gnostically of this holy quality devotes himself to contemplation, communing in purity with the divine, he enters more nearly into the state of impassible identity, so as no longer to have science and possess knowledge, but to be science and knowledge.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":12,"verse":20,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_63_book_iv_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"82","folder":"ANF-02","text":"The conversion, however, which leads to divine things, the Stoics say, is affected by a change, the soul being changed to wisdom. And Plato: \"On the soul taking a turn to what is better, and a change from a kind of nocturnal day.\" Now the philosophers also allow the good man an exit from life in accordance with reason, in the case of one depriving him of active exertion, so that the hope of action is no longer left him. And the judge who compels us to deny Him whom we love, I regard as showing who is and who is not the friend of God. In that case there is not left ground for even examining what one prefers-the menaces of man or the love of God. And abstinence from vicious acts is found, somehow, [to result in] the diminution and extinction of vicious propensities, their energy being destroyed by inaction. And this is the import of \"Sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and come, follow Me\"[fn-66-P6685_2035299:28-nf] -that is, follow what is said by the Lord. Some say that by what \"thou hast\" He designated the things in the soul, of a nature not akin to it, though how these are bestowed on the poor they are not able to say. For God dispenses to all according to desert, His distribution being righteous. Despising, therefore, the possessions which God apportions to thee in thy magnificence, comply with what is spoken by me; haste to the ascent of the Spirit, being not only justified by abstinence from what is evil, but in addition also perfected, by Christlike beneficence.[fn-66-P6686_2035902:29-nf] In this instance He convicted the man, who boasted that he had fulfilled the injunctions of the law, of not loving his neighbour; and it is by beneficence that the love which, according to the gnostic ascending scale, is Lord of the Sabbath, proclaims itself.[fn-66-P6687_2036187:30-nf] We must then, according to my view, have recourse to the word of salvation neither from fear of punishment nor promise of a gift, but on account of the good itself. Such, as do so, stand on the right hand of the sanctuary; but those who think that by the gift of what is perishable they shall receive in exchange what belongs to immortality are in the parable of the two brothers called \"hirelings.\" And is there not some light thrown here on the expression \"in the likeness and image,\" in the fact that some live according to the likeness of Christ, while those who stand on the left hand live according to their image? Thereare then two things proceeding from the truth, one root lying beneath both,-the choice being, however, not equal, or rather the difference that is in the choice not being equal. To choose by way of imitation differs, as appears to me, from the choice of him who chooses according to knowledge, as that which is set on fire differs from that which is illuminated. Israel, then, is the light of the likeness which is according to the Scripture. But the image is another thing. What means the parable of Lazarus, by showing the image of the rich and poor? And what the saying, \"No man can serve two masters, God and Mammon? \"-the Lord so terming the love of money. For instance, the covetous, who were invited, responded not to the invitation to the supper, not because of their possessing property, but of their inordinate affection to what they possessed. \"The foxes,\" then, have holes. He called those evil and earthly men who are occupied about the wealth which is mined and dug from the ground, foxes. Thus also, in reference to Herod: \"Go, tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and perform cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.\"[fn-66-P6688_2038149:31-nf] For He applied the name \"fowls of the air\" to those who were distinct from the other birds-those really pure, those that have the power of flying to the knowledge of the heavenly Word.

He is, in truth, \"the bag that waxeth not old,\" the provisions of eternal life, \"the treasure that faileth not in heaven.\"[fn-66-P6695_2040848:38-nf] \"For I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,\"[fn-66-P6696_2040918:39-nf] saith the Lord. And they say those things to those who wish to be poor for righteousness' sake. For they have heard in the commandment that \"the broad and wide way leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in by it.\"[fn-66-P6697_2041161:40-nf] It is not of anything else that the assertion is made, but of profligacy, and love of women, and love of glory, and ambition, and similar passions. For so He says, \"Fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee; and whose shall those things be which thou hast prepared? \"[fn-66-P6698_2041459:41-nf] And the commandment is expressed in these very words, \"Take heed, therefore, of covetousness. For a man's life does not consist in the abundance of those things which he possesses. For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? \"[fn-66-P6699_2041801:42-nf] \"Wherefore I say, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for your body, what ye shall put on. For your life is more than meat, and your body than raiment.\"[fn-67-P6700_2041996:43-nf] And again, \"For your Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.\" \"But seek first the kingdom of heaven, and its righteousness,\" for these are the great things, and the things which are small and appertain to this life \"shall be added to you.\"[fn-67-P6701_2042286:44-nf] Does He not plainly then exhort us to follow the gnostic life, and enjoin us to seek the truth in word and deed? Therefore Christ, who trains the soul, reckons one rich, not by his gifts, but by his choice. It is said, therefore, that Zaccheus, or, according to some, Matthew, the chief of the publicans, on hearing that the Lord had deigned to come to him, said, \"Lord, and if I have taken anything by false accusation, I restore him fourfold; \"on which the Saviour said, \"The Son of man, on coming to-day, has found that which was lost.\"[fn-67-P6702_2042866:45-nf] Again, on seeing the rich cast into the treasury according to their wealth, and the widow two mites, He said \"that the widow had cast in more than they all,\" for \"they had contributed of their abundance, but she of her destitution.\" And because He brought all things to bear on the discipline of the soul, He said, \"Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.\"[fn-67-P6703_2043264:46-nf] And the meek are those who have quelled the battle of unbelief in the soul, the battle of wrath, and lust, and the other forms that are subject to them. And He praises those meek by choice, not by necessity. For there are with the Lord both rewards and\" many mansions,\" corresponding to men's lives. \"Whosoever shall receive,\" says He, \"a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward; and whosoever shall receive a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward; and whoso shall receive one of the least of these my disciples, shall not lose his reward.\"[fn-67-P6704_2043896:47-nf] And again, the differences of virtue according to merit, and the noble rewards, He indicated by the hours unequal in number; and in addition, by the equal reward given to each of the labourers-that is, salvation, which is meant by the penny-He indicated the equality of justice; and the difference of those called He intimated, by those who worked for unequal portions of time. They shall work, therefore, in accordance with the appropriate mansions of which they have been deemed worthy as rewards, being fellow-workers in the ineffable administration and service.[fn-67-P6705_2044484:48-nf] \"Those, then,\" says Plato, \"who seem called to a holy life, are those who, freed and released from those earthly localities as from prisons, have reached the pure dwelling-place on high.\" In clearer terms again he expresses the same thing: \"Those who by philosophy have been sufficiently purged from those things, live without bodies entirely for all time. Although they are enveloped in certain shapes; in the case of some, of air, and others, of fire.\" He adds further: \"And they reach abodes fairer than those, which it is not easy, nor is there sufficient time now to describe.\" Whence with reason, \"blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted; \"[fn-67-P6706_2045253:49-nf] for they who have repented of their former evil life shall attain to\"the calling\" (klh=sin), for this is the meaning of being comforted (paraklhqh=nai). And there are two styles of penitents.[fn-67-P6707_2045462:50-nf] That which is more common is fear on account of what is done; but the other which is more special, the shame which the spirit feels in itself arising from conscience. Whether then, here or elsewhere (for no place is devoid of the beneficence of God), He again says, \"Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.\" And mercy is not, as some of the philosophers have imagined, pain on account of others' calamities, but rather something good, as the prophets say. For it is said, \"I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.\"[fn-67-P6708_2046183:51-nf] And He[fn-67-P6709_2046229:52-nf] means by the merciful, not only those who do acts of mercy, but those who wish to do them, though they be not able; who do as far as purpose is concerned. For sometimes we wish by the gift of money or by personal effort to do mercy, as to assist one in want, or help one who is sick, or stand by one who is in any emergency; and are not able either from poverty, or disease, or old age (for this also is natural disease), to carry out our purpose, in reference to the things to which we are impelled, being unable to conduct them to the end we wished. Those, who have entertained the wish whose purpose is equal, share in the same honour with those who have the ability, although others have the advantage in point of resources.[fn-67-P6710_2046980:53-nf] And since there are two paths of reaching the perfection of salvation, works and knowledge, He called the\"pure in heart blessed, for they shall see God.\"[fn-67-P6711_2047230:54-nf] And if we really look to the truth of the matter, knowledge is the purification of the leading faculty of the soul, and is a good activity. Some things accordingly are good in themselves, and others by participation in what is good, as we say good actions are good. But without things intermediate which hold the place of material, neither good nor bad actions are constituted, such I mean as life, and health, and other necessary things or circumstantials. Pure then as respects corporeal lusts, and pure in respect of holy thoughts, he means those are, who attain to the knowledge of God, when the chief faculty of the soul has nothing spurious to stand in the way of its power. When, therefore, he who partakes gnostically of this holy quality devotes himself to contemplation, communing in purity with the divine, he enters more nearly into the state of impassible identity, so as no longer to have science and possess knowledge, but to be science and knowledge.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":12,"verse":22,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_63_book_iv_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"82","folder":"ANF-02","text":"The conversion, however, which leads to divine things, the Stoics say, is affected by a change, the soul being changed to wisdom. And Plato: \"On the soul taking a turn to what is better, and a change from a kind of nocturnal day.\" Now the philosophers also allow the good man an exit from life in accordance with reason, in the case of one depriving him of active exertion, so that the hope of action is no longer left him. And the judge who compels us to deny Him whom we love, I regard as showing who is and who is not the friend of God. In that case there is not left ground for even examining what one prefers-the menaces of man or the love of God. And abstinence from vicious acts is found, somehow, [to result in] the diminution and extinction of vicious propensities, their energy being destroyed by inaction. And this is the import of \"Sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and come, follow Me\"[fn-66-P6685_2035299:28-nf] -that is, follow what is said by the Lord. Some say that by what \"thou hast\" He designated the things in the soul, of a nature not akin to it, though how these are bestowed on the poor they are not able to say. For God dispenses to all according to desert, His distribution being righteous. Despising, therefore, the possessions which God apportions to thee in thy magnificence, comply with what is spoken by me; haste to the ascent of the Spirit, being not only justified by abstinence from what is evil, but in addition also perfected, by Christlike beneficence.[fn-66-P6686_2035902:29-nf] In this instance He convicted the man, who boasted that he had fulfilled the injunctions of the law, of not loving his neighbour; and it is by beneficence that the love which, according to the gnostic ascending scale, is Lord of the Sabbath, proclaims itself.[fn-66-P6687_2036187:30-nf] We must then, according to my view, have recourse to the word of salvation neither from fear of punishment nor promise of a gift, but on account of the good itself. Such, as do so, stand on the right hand of the sanctuary; but those who think that by the gift of what is perishable they shall receive in exchange what belongs to immortality are in the parable of the two brothers called \"hirelings.\" And is there not some light thrown here on the expression \"in the likeness and image,\" in the fact that some live according to the likeness of Christ, while those who stand on the left hand live according to their image? Thereare then two things proceeding from the truth, one root lying beneath both,-the choice being, however, not equal, or rather the difference that is in the choice not being equal. To choose by way of imitation differs, as appears to me, from the choice of him who chooses according to knowledge, as that which is set on fire differs from that which is illuminated. Israel, then, is the light of the likeness which is according to the Scripture. But the image is another thing. What means the parable of Lazarus, by showing the image of the rich and poor? And what the saying, \"No man can serve two masters, God and Mammon? \"-the Lord so terming the love of money. For instance, the covetous, who were invited, responded not to the invitation to the supper, not because of their possessing property, but of their inordinate affection to what they possessed. \"The foxes,\" then, have holes. He called those evil and earthly men who are occupied about the wealth which is mined and dug from the ground, foxes. Thus also, in reference to Herod: \"Go, tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and perform cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.\"[fn-66-P6688_2038149:31-nf] For He applied the name \"fowls of the air\" to those who were distinct from the other birds-those really pure, those that have the power of flying to the knowledge of the heavenly Word. For not riches only, but also honour, and marriage, and poverty, have ten thousand cares for him who is unfit for them.[fn-66-P6689_2038474:32-nf] And those cares He indicated in the parable of the fourfold seed, when He said that \"the seed of the word which fell unto the thorns\" and hedges was choked by them, and could not bring forth fruit. It is therefore necessary to learn how to make use of every occurrence, so as by a good life, according to knowledge, to be trained for the state of eternal life. For it said, \"I saw the wicked exalted and towering as the cedars of Lebanon; and I passed,\" says the Scripture, \"and, lo, he was not; and I sought him, and his place was not found. Keep innocence, and look on uprightness: for there is a remnant to the man of peace.\"[fn-66-P6690_2039123:33-nf] Such will he be who believes unfeignedly with his whole heart, and is tranquil in his whole soul. \"For the different people honour me with their lips, but their heart is far from the Lord.\"[fn-66-P6691_2039337:34-nf] \"They bless with their mouth, but they curse in their heart.\"[fn-66-P6692_2039442:35-nf] \"They loved Him with their mouth, and lied to Him with their tongue; but their heart was not right with Him, and they were not faithful to His covenant.\" Wherefore \"let the false lips become speechless, and let the Lord destroy the boastful tongue: those who say, We shall magnify our tongue, and our lips are our own; who is Lord over us? For the affliction of the poor and the groaning of the needy now will I arise, saith the Lord; I will set him in safety; I will speak out in his case.\"[fn-66-P6693_2039952:36-nf] For it is to the humble that Christ belongs, who do not exalt themselves against His flock. \"Lay not up for yourselves, therefore, treasures on the earth, where moth and rust destroy, and thieves break through and steal,\"[fn-66-P6694_2040193:37-nf] says the Lord, in reproach perchance of the covetous, and perchance also of those who are simply anxious and full of cares, and those too who indulge their bodies.

It is said, therefore, that Zaccheus, or, according to some, Matthew, the chief of the publicans, on hearing that the Lord had deigned to come to him, said, \"Lord, and if I have taken anything by false accusation, I restore him fourfold; \"on which the Saviour said, \"The Son of man, on coming to-day, has found that which was lost.\"[fn-67-P6702_2042866:45-nf] Again, on seeing the rich cast into the treasury according to their wealth, and the widow two mites, He said \"that the widow had cast in more than they all,\" for \"they had contributed of their abundance, but she of her destitution.\" And because He brought all things to bear on the discipline of the soul, He said, \"Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.\"[fn-67-P6703_2043264:46-nf] And the meek are those who have quelled the battle of unbelief in the soul, the battle of wrath, and lust, and the other forms that are subject to them. And He praises those meek by choice, not by necessity. For there are with the Lord both rewards and\" many mansions,\" corresponding to men's lives. \"Whosoever shall receive,\" says He, \"a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward; and whosoever shall receive a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward; and whoso shall receive one of the least of these my disciples, shall not lose his reward.\"[fn-67-P6704_2043896:47-nf] And again, the differences of virtue according to merit, and the noble rewards, He indicated by the hours unequal in number; and in addition, by the equal reward given to each of the labourers-that is, salvation, which is meant by the penny-He indicated the equality of justice; and the difference of those called He intimated, by those who worked for unequal portions of time. They shall work, therefore, in accordance with the appropriate mansions of which they have been deemed worthy as rewards, being fellow-workers in the ineffable administration and service.[fn-67-P6705_2044484:48-nf] \"Those, then,\" says Plato, \"who seem called to a holy life, are those who, freed and released from those earthly localities as from prisons, have reached the pure dwelling-place on high.\" In clearer terms again he expresses the same thing: \"Those who by philosophy have been sufficiently purged from those things, live without bodies entirely for all time. Although they are enveloped in certain shapes; in the case of some, of air, and others, of fire.\" He adds further: \"And they reach abodes fairer than those, which it is not easy, nor is there sufficient time now to describe.\" Whence with reason, \"blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted; \"[fn-67-P6706_2045253:49-nf] for they who have repented of their former evil life shall attain to\"the calling\" (klh=sin), for this is the meaning of being comforted (paraklhqh=nai). And there are two styles of penitents.[fn-67-P6707_2045462:50-nf] That which is more common is fear on account of what is done; but the other which is more special, the shame which the spirit feels in itself arising from conscience. Whether then, here or elsewhere (for no place is devoid of the beneficence of God), He again says, \"Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.\" And mercy is not, as some of the philosophers have imagined, pain on account of others' calamities, but rather something good, as the prophets say. For it is said, \"I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.\"[fn-67-P6708_2046183:51-nf] And He[fn-67-P6709_2046229:52-nf] means by the merciful, not only those who do acts of mercy, but those who wish to do them, though they be not able; who do as far as purpose is concerned. For sometimes we wish by the gift of money or by personal effort to do mercy, as to assist one in want, or help one who is sick, or stand by one who is in any emergency; and are not able either from poverty, or disease, or old age (for this also is natural disease), to carry out our purpose, in reference to the things to which we are impelled, being unable to conduct them to the end we wished. Those, who have entertained the wish whose purpose is equal, share in the same honour with those who have the ability, although others have the advantage in point of resources.[fn-67-P6710_2046980:53-nf] And since there are two paths of reaching the perfection of salvation, works and knowledge, He called the\"pure in heart blessed, for they shall see God.\"[fn-67-P6711_2047230:54-nf] And if we really look to the truth of the matter, knowledge is the purification of the leading faculty of the soul, and is a good activity. Some things accordingly are good in themselves, and others by participation in what is good, as we say good actions are good. But without things intermediate which hold the place of material, neither good nor bad actions are constituted, such I mean as life, and health, and other necessary things or circumstantials. Pure then as respects corporeal lusts, and pure in respect of holy thoughts, he means those are, who attain to the knowledge of God, when the chief faculty of the soul has nothing spurious to stand in the way of its power. When, therefore, he who partakes gnostically of this holy quality devotes himself to contemplation, communing in purity with the divine, he enters more nearly into the state of impassible identity, so as no longer to have science and possess knowledge, but to be science and knowledge.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":12,"verse":30,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_63_book_iv_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"82","folder":"ANF-02","text":"The conversion, however, which leads to divine things, the Stoics say, is affected by a change, the soul being changed to wisdom. And Plato: \"On the soul taking a turn to what is better, and a change from a kind of nocturnal day.\" Now the philosophers also allow the good man an exit from life in accordance with reason, in the case of one depriving him of active exertion, so that the hope of action is no longer left him. And the judge who compels us to deny Him whom we love, I regard as showing who is and who is not the friend of God. In that case there is not left ground for even examining what one prefers-the menaces of man or the love of God. And abstinence from vicious acts is found, somehow, [to result in] the diminution and extinction of vicious propensities, their energy being destroyed by inaction. And this is the import of \"Sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and come, follow Me\"[fn-66-P6685_2035299:28-nf] -that is, follow what is said by the Lord. Some say that by what \"thou hast\" He designated the things in the soul, of a nature not akin to it, though how these are bestowed on the poor they are not able to say. For God dispenses to all according to desert, His distribution being righteous. Despising, therefore, the possessions which God apportions to thee in thy magnificence, comply with what is spoken by me; haste to the ascent of the Spirit, being not only justified by abstinence from what is evil, but in addition also perfected, by Christlike beneficence.[fn-66-P6686_2035902:29-nf] In this instance He convicted the man, who boasted that he had fulfilled the injunctions of the law, of not loving his neighbour; and it is by beneficence that the love which, according to the gnostic ascending scale, is Lord of the Sabbath, proclaims itself.[fn-66-P6687_2036187:30-nf] We must then, according to my view, have recourse to the word of salvation neither from fear of punishment nor promise of a gift, but on account of the good itself. Such, as do so, stand on the right hand of the sanctuary; but those who think that by the gift of what is perishable they shall receive in exchange what belongs to immortality are in the parable of the two brothers called \"hirelings.\" And is there not some light thrown here on the expression \"in the likeness and image,\" in the fact that some live according to the likeness of Christ, while those who stand on the left hand live according to their image? Thereare then two things proceeding from the truth, one root lying beneath both,-the choice being, however, not equal, or rather the difference that is in the choice not being equal. To choose by way of imitation differs, as appears to me, from the choice of him who chooses according to knowledge, as that which is set on fire differs from that which is illuminated. Israel, then, is the light of the likeness which is according to the Scripture. But the image is another thing. What means the parable of Lazarus, by showing the image of the rich and poor? And what the saying, \"No man can serve two masters, God and Mammon? \"-the Lord so terming the love of money. For instance, the covetous, who were invited, responded not to the invitation to the supper, not because of their possessing property, but of their inordinate affection to what they possessed. \"The foxes,\" then, have holes. He called those evil and earthly men who are occupied about the wealth which is mined and dug from the ground, foxes. Thus also, in reference to Herod: \"Go, tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and perform cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.\"[fn-66-P6688_2038149:31-nf] For He applied the name \"fowls of the air\" to those who were distinct from the other birds-those really pure, those that have the power of flying to the knowledge of the heavenly Word. For not riches only, but also honour, and marriage, and poverty, have ten thousand cares for him who is unfit for them.[fn-66-P6689_2038474:32-nf] And those cares He indicated in the parable of the fourfold seed, when He said that \"the seed of the word which fell unto the thorns\" and hedges was choked by them, and could not bring forth fruit. It is therefore necessary to learn how to make use of every occurrence, so as by a good life, according to knowledge, to be trained for the state of eternal life. For it said, \"I saw the wicked exalted and towering as the cedars of Lebanon; and I passed,\" says the Scripture, \"and, lo, he was not; and I sought him, and his place was not found. Keep innocence, and look on uprightness: for there is a remnant to the man of peace.\"[fn-66-P6690_2039123:33-nf] Such will he be who believes unfeignedly with his whole heart, and is tranquil in his whole soul. \"For the different people honour me with their lips, but their heart is far from the Lord.\"[fn-66-P6691_2039337:34-nf] \"They bless with their mouth, but they curse in their heart.\"[fn-66-P6692_2039442:35-nf] \"They loved Him with their mouth, and lied to Him with their tongue; but their heart was not right with Him, and they were not faithful to His covenant.\" Wherefore \"let the false lips become speechless, and let the Lord destroy the boastful tongue: those who say, We shall magnify our tongue, and our lips are our own; who is Lord over us? For the affliction of the poor and the groaning of the needy now will I arise, saith the Lord; I will set him in safety; I will speak out in his case.\"[fn-66-P6693_2039952:36-nf] For it is to the humble that Christ belongs, who do not exalt themselves against His flock. \"Lay not up for yourselves, therefore, treasures on the earth, where moth and rust destroy, and thieves break through and steal,\"[fn-66-P6694_2040193:37-nf] says the Lord, in reproach perchance of the covetous, and perchance also of those who are simply anxious and full of cares, and those too who indulge their bodies. For amours, and diseases, and evil thoughts \"break through\" the mind and the whole man. But our true \"treasure\" is where what is allied to our mind is, since it bestows the communicative power of righteousness, showing that we must assign to the habit of our old conversation what we have acquired by it, and have recourse to God, beseeching mercy. He is, in truth, \"the bag that waxeth not old,\" the provisions of eternal life, \"the treasure that faileth not in heaven.\"[fn-66-P6695_2040848:38-nf] \"For I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,\"[fn-66-P6696_2040918:39-nf] saith the Lord. And they say those things to those who wish to be poor for righteousness' sake. For they have heard in the commandment that \"the broad and wide way leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in by it.\"[fn-66-P6697_2041161:40-nf] It is not of anything else that the assertion is made, but of profligacy, and love of women, and love of glory, and ambition, and similar passions. For so He says, \"Fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee; and whose shall those things be which thou hast prepared? \"[fn-66-P6698_2041459:41-nf] And the commandment is expressed in these very words, \"Take heed, therefore, of covetousness. For a man's life does not consist in the abundance of those things which he possesses. For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? \"[fn-66-P6699_2041801:42-nf] \"Wherefore I say, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for your body, what ye shall put on. For your life is more than meat, and your body than raiment.\"[fn-67-P6700_2041996:43-nf] And again, \"For your Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.\" \"But seek first the kingdom of heaven, and its righteousness,\" for these are the great things, and the things which are small and appertain to this life \"shall be added to you.\"[fn-67-P6701_2042286:44-nf] Does He not plainly then exhort us to follow the gnostic life, and enjoin us to seek the truth in word and deed?

For instance, the Shepherd[fn-68-P6827_2082089:110-nf] says: \"You will escape the energy of the wild beast, if your heart become pure and blameless.\" Also the Lord Himself says: \"Satan hath desired to sift you; but I have prayed.\"[fn-68-P6828_2082298:111-nf] Alone, therefore, the Lord, for the purification of the men who plotted against Him and disbelieved Him, \"drank the cup; \"in imitation of whom the apostles, that they might be in reality Gnostics, and perfect, suffered for the Churches which they founded.

For instance, the Shepherd[fn-68-P6827_2082089:110-nf] says: \"You will escape the energy of the wild beast, if your heart become pure and blameless.\" Also the Lord Himself says: \"Satan hath desired to sift you; but I have prayed.\"[fn-68-P6828_2082298:111-nf] Alone, therefore, the Lord, for the purification of the men who plotted against Him and disbelieved Him, \"drank the cup; \"in imitation of whom the apostles, that they might be in reality Gnostics, and perfect, suffered for the Churches which they founded. So, then, also the Gnostics who tread in the footsteps of the apostles ought to be sinless, and, out of love to the Lord, to love also their brother; so that, if occasion call, enduring without stumbling, afflictions for the Church, \"they may drink the cup.\" Those who witness in their life by deed, and at the tribunal by word, whether entertaining hope or surmising fear, are better than those who confess salvation by their mouth alone. But if one ascend also to love, he is a really blessed and true martyr, having confessed perfectly both to the commandments and to God, by the Lord; whom having loved, he acknowledged a brother, giving himself up wholly for God, resigning pleasantly and lovingly the man when asked, like a deposit.[fn-68-P6829_2083319:112-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":12,"verse":50,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_148_a_treatise_on_re_baptism_by_an_anonymous_writer_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"ANF-05","text":"14. And even to this point the whole of that heretical baptism may be amended, after the intervention of some space of time, if a man should survive and amend his faith, as our God, in the Gospel according to Luke, spoke to His disciples, saying, \"But I have another baptism to be baptized with.\"[fn-107-P10777_3418571:43-nf] Also according to Mark He said, with the same purpose, to the sons of Zebedee: \"Are ye able to drink of the cup which I drink of, or to be baptized with the baptism wherewith I am baptized? \"[fn-107-P10778_3418782:44-nf] Because He knew that those men had to be baptized not only with water, but also in their own blood; so that, as well baptized in this baptism only, they might attain the sound faith and the simple love of the laver, and, baptized in both ways, they might in like manner to the same extent attain the baptism of salvation and glory. For what was said by the Lord, \"I have another baptism to be baptized with,\" signifies in this place not a second baptism, as if there were two baptisms, but demonstrates that there is moreover a baptism of another kind given to us, concurring to the same salvation. And it was fitting that both these kinds should first of all be initiated and sanctified by our Lord Himself, so that either one of the two or both kinds might afford to us this one twofold saving and glorifying baptism; and certain ways of the one baptism might so be laid open to us, that at times some one of them might be wanting without mischief, even as in the case of martyrs that hear the word, the baptism of water is wanting without evil; and yet we are certain that these, if they had any indulgence, would also be used to be baptized with water. And also to those who are made lawful believers, the baptism of their own blood is wanting without mischief, because, being baptized in the name of Christ, they have been redeemed with the most precious blood of the Lord; since both of these rivers of the baptism of the Lord proceed out of one and the same fountain, that every one who thirsts may come and drink, as says the Scripture, \"From his belly flowed rivers of living water; \"[fn-107-P10779_3420393:45-nf] which rivers were manifested first of all in the Lord's passion, when from His side, pierced by the soldier's spear, flowed blood and water, so that the one side of the same person emitted two rivers of a different kind, that whosoever should believe and drink of both rivers might be filled with the Holy Spirit. For, speaking of these rivers, the Lord set this forth, signifying the Holy Spirit whom they should receive who should believe on Him: \"But the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.\"[fn-107-P10780_3420934:46-nf] And when He thus said how baptism might be produced, which the apostle declares to be one, it is assuredly manifest on that principle that there are different kinds of one and the same baptism that flow from one wound into water and blood; since there are there two baptisms of water of which we have spoken, that is, of one and the same kind,[fn-107-P10781_3421297:47-nf] although the baptism of each kind ought to be one, as we have more fully spoken.","title":"A Treatise on Re-Baptism by an Anonymous Writer.","author":"Appendix"},{"chapter":12,"verse":49,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_56_oration_xlv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"21","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"XVI.

Of which fear and love the Lord in chiding some shows what is befitting for each one: \"A son knoweth his own father, and a servant feareth his lord: And if I be a Father, where is My honour: and if I be a Lord, where is my fear?\"[fn-51-P5163_1867256:19-nf] For one who is a servant must needs fear because \"if knowing his lord's will he has done things worthy of stripes, he shall be beaten with many stripes.\"[fn-51-P5164_1867426:20-nf] Whoever then by this love has attained the image and likeness of God, will now delight in goodness for the pleasure of goodness itself, and having somehow a like feeling of patience and gentleness will henceforth be angered by no faults of sinners, but in his compassion and sympathy will rather ask for pardon for their infirmities, and, remembering that for so long he himself was tried by the stings of similar passions till by the Lord's mercy he was saved, will feel that, as he was saved from carnal attacks not by the teaching of his own exertions but by God's protection, not anger but pity ought to be shown to those who go astray; and with full peace of mind will he sing to God the following verse: \"Thou hast broken my chains. I will offer to Thee the sacrifice of praise;\" and: \"except the Lord had helped me, my soul had almost dwelt in hell.\"[fn-51-P5165_1868307:21-nf] And while he continues in this humility of mind he will be able even to fulfil this Evangelic command of perfection: \"Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that persecute you and slander you.\"[fn-51-P5166_1868584:22-nf] And so it will be vouchsafed to us to attain that reward which is subjoined, whereby we shall not only bear the image and likeness of God, but shall even be called sons: \"that ye may be,\" says He \"sons of your Father which is in heaven, Who maketh His sun to rise on the good and evil, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust:\"[fn-51-P5167_1868938:23-nf] and this feeling the blessed John knew that he had attained when he said: \"that we may have confidence in the day of judgment, because as He is so are we also in this world.\"[fn-51-P5168_1869126:24-nf] For in what can a weak and fragile human nature be like Him, except in always showing a calm love in its heart towards the good and evil, the just and the unjust, in imitation of God, and by doing good for the love of goodness itself, arriving at that true adoption of the sons of God, of which also the blessed Apostle speaks as follows: \"Every one that is born of God doeth not sin, for His seed is in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God;\" and again: \"We know that every one who is born of God sinneth not, but his birth of God preserves him, and the wicked one toucheth him not?\"[fn-51-P5169_1869743:25-nf] And this must be understood not of all kinds of sins, but only of mortal sins: and if any one will not extricate and cleanse himself from these, for him the aforesaid Apostle tells us in another place that we ought not even to pray, saying: \"If a man knows his brother to be sinning a sin not unto death, let him ask, and He will give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he should ask for it.\"[fn-51-P5170_1870216:26-nf] But of those which he says are not unto death, from which even those who serve Christ faithfully cannot, with whatever care they keep themselves, be free, of these he says: \"If we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us;\" and again: \"If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.\"[fn-51-P5171_1870583:27-nf] For it is an impossibility for any one of the saints not to fall into those trivial faults which are committed by word, and thought, and ignorance, and forgetfulness, and necessity, and will, and surprise: which though quite different from that sin which is said to be unto death, still cannot be free from fault and blame.","title":"XI.

But when He had brought on that time which He Himself had appointed, at which He desired to suffer in the body for all men, He announces it to the Father, saying, `Father, the hour is come; glorify Thy Son[fn-44-P4449_1832986:72-nf] .' And then He no longer hid Himself from those who sought Him, but stood willing to be taken by them; for the Scripture says, He said to them that came unto Him, `Whom seek ye[fn-44-P4450_1833182:73-nf] ?' and when they answered, `Jesus of Nazareth,' He saith unto them, `I am He whom ye seek.' And this He did even more than once; and so they straightway led Him away to Pilate. He neither suffered Himself to be taken before the time came, nor did He hide Himself when it was come; but gave Himself up to them that conspired against Him, that He might shew to all men that the life and death of man depend upon the divine sentence; and that without our Father which is in heaven, neither a hair of man's head can become white or black, nor a sparrow ever fall into the snare[fn-44-P4451_1833791:74-nf] .","title":"Defence of His Flight","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":12,"verse":57,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_63_xiii_the_third_conference_of_abbot_chaeremon_","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"57","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"For we should not hold that God made man such that he can never will or be capable of what is good: or else He has not granted him a free will, if He has suffered him only to will or be capable of evil, but neither to will or be capable of what is good of himself. And, in this case how will that first statement of the Lord made about men after the fall stand: \"Behold, Adam is become as one of us, knowing good and evil?\"[fn-53-P5348_1915089:59-nf] For we cannot think that before, he was such as to be altogether ignorant of good. Otherwise we should have to admit that he was formed like some irrational and insensate beast: which is sufficiently absurd and altogether alien from the Catholic faith. Moreover as the wisest Solomon says: \"God made man upright,\" i.e., always to enjoy the knowledge of good only, \"But they have sought out many imaginations,\"[fn-53-P5349_1915518:60-nf] for they came, as has been said, to know good and evil. Adam therefore after the fall conceived a knowledge of evil which he had not previously, but did not lose the knowledge of good which he had before. Finally the Apostle's words very clearly show that mankind did not lose after the fall of Adam the knowledge of good: as he says: \"For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things of the law, these, though they have not the law, are a law to themselves, as they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness to these, and their thoughts within them either accusing or else excusing them, in the day in which God shall judge the secrets of men.\"[fn-53-P5350_1916254:61-nf] And with the same meaning the Lord rebukes by the prophet the unnatural but freely chosen blindness of the Jews, which they by their obstinacy brought upon themselves, saying: \"Hear ye deaf, and ye blind, behold that you may see. Who is deaf but My servant? and blind, but he to whom I have sent My messengers?\"[fn-53-P5351_1916588:62-nf] And that no one might ascribe this blindness of theirs to nature instead of to their own will, elsewhere He says: \"Bring forth the people that are blind and have eyes: that are deaf and have ears;\" and again: \"having eyes, but ye see not; and ears, but ye hear not.\"[fn-53-P5352_1916878:63-nf] The Lord also says in the gospel: \"Because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not neither do they understand.\"[fn-53-P5353_1917028:64-nf] And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says: \"Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand: and seeing ye shall see and shall not see. For the heart of this people is waxed fat, and their ears are dull of hearing: and they have closed their eyes, lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart, and be turned and I should heal them.\"[fn-53-P5354_1917450:65-nf] Finally in order to denote that the possibility of good was in them, in chiding the Pharisees, He says: \"But why of your own selves do ye not judge what is right?\"[fn-53-P5355_1917634:66-nf] And this he certainly would not have said to them, unless He knew that by their natural judgment they could discern what was fair. Wherefore we must take care not to refer all the merits of the saints to the Lord in such a way as to ascribe nothing but what is evil and perverse to human nature: in doing which we are confuted by the evidence of the most wise Solomon, or rather of the Lord Himself, Whose words these are; for when the building of the Temple was finished and he was praying, he spoke as follows: \"And David my father would have built a house to the name of the Lord God of Israel: and the Lord said to David my father: Whereas thou hast thought in thine heart to build a house to My name, thou hast well done in having this same thing in thy mind. Nevertheless thou shall not build a house to My name.\"[fn-53-P5356_1918476:67-nf] This thought then and this purpose of king David, are we to call it good and from God or bad and from man? For if that thought was good and from God, why did He by whom it was inspired refuse that it should be carried into effect? But if it is bad and from man, why is it praised by the Lord? It remains then that we must take it as good and from man. And in the same way we can take our own thoughts today. For it was not given only to David to think what is good of himself, nor is it denied to us naturally to think or imagine anything that is good. It cannot then be doubted that there are by nature some seeds of goodness in every soul implanted by the kindness of the Creator: but unless these are quickened by the assistance of God, they will not be able to attain to an increase of perfection, for, as the blessed Apostle says: \"Neither is he that planteth anything nor he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase.\"[fn-53-P5357_1919433:68-nf] But that freedom of the will is to some degree in a man's own power is very clearly taught in the book termed the Pastor,[fn-53-P5358_1919575:69-nf] where two angels are said to be attached to each one of us, i.e., a good and a bad one, while it lies at a man's own option to choose which to follow. And therefore the will always remains free in man, and can either neglect or delight in the grace of God. For the Apostle would not have commanded saying: \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,\" had he not known that it could be advanced or neglected by us. But that men might not fancy that they had no need of Divine aid for the work of Salvation, he subjoins: \"For it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do, of His good pleasure.\"[fn-53-P5359_1920216:70-nf] And therefore he warns Timothy and says: \"Neglect not the grace of God which is in thee;\" and again: \"For which cause I exhort thee to stir up the grace of God which is in thee.\"[fn-53-P5360_1920418:71-nf] Hence also in writing to the Corinthians he exhorts and warns them not through their unfruitful works to show themselves unworthy of the grace of God, saying: \"And we helping, exhort you that ye receive not the grace of God in vain:\"[fn-53-P5361_1920685:72-nf] for the reception of saving grace was of no profit to Simon doubtless because he had received it in vain; for he would not obey the command of the blessed Peter who said: \"Repent of thine iniquity, and pray God if haply the thoughts of thine heart may be forgiven thee; for I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and the bonds of iniquity.\"[fn-53-P5362_1921057:73-nf] It prevents therefore the will of man, for it is said: \"My God will prevent me with His mercy;\"[fn-53-P5363_1921177:74-nf] and again when God waits and for our good delays, that He may put our desires to the test, our will precedes, for it is said: \"And in the morning my prayer shall prevent Thee;\" and again: \"I prevented the dawning of the day and cried;\" and: \"Mine eyes have prevented the morning.\"[fn-53-P5364_1921485:75-nf] For He calls and invites us, when He says: \"All the day long I stretched forth My hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people;\"[fn-53-P5365_1921674:76-nf] and He is invited by us when we say to Him: \"All the day long I have stretched forth My hands unto Thee\"[fn-53-P5366_1921796:77-nf] He waits for us, when it is said by the prophet: \"Wherefore the Lord waiteth to have compassion upon us;\"[fn-53-P5367_1921937:78-nf] and He is waited for by us, when we say: \"I waited patiently for the Lord, and He inclined unto me;\" and: \"I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord.\"[fn-53-P5368_1922104:79-nf] He strengthens us when He says: \"And I have chastised them, and strengthened their arms; and they have imagined evil against me;\"[fn-53-P5369_1922280:80-nf] and He exhorts us to strengthen ourselves when He says: \"Strengthen ye the weak hands, and make strong the feeble knees.\"[fn-53-P5370_1922422:81-nf] Jesus cries: \"If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink;\"[fn-53-P5371_1922504:82-nf] the prophet also cries to Him: \"I have laboured with crying, my jaws are become hoarse: mine eyes have failed, whilst I hope in my God.\"[fn-53-P5372_1922663:83-nf] The Lord seeks us, when He says: \"I sought and there was no man. I called, and there was none to answer;\"[fn-53-P5373_1922797:84-nf] and He Himself is sought by the bride who mourns with tears: \"I sought on my bed by night Him whom my soul loved: I sought Him and found Him not; I called Him, and He gave me no answer.\"[fn-53-P5374_1923001:85-nf] ","title":"XIII.

For we must perceive and confess that the so disordered ruin arising from that affliction, which has in a great measure laid waste, and is even still laying waste, our flock, has visited us according to our sins, in that we do not keep the way of the Lord, nor observe the heavenly commandments given to us for our salvation. Our Lord did the will of His Father, and we do not do the will of our Lord; eager about our patrimony and our gain, seeking to satisfy our pride, yielding ourselves wholly to emulation and to strife, careless of simplicity and faith, renouncing the world in words only, and not in deeds, every one of us pleasing himself, and displeasing all others,[fn-48-P4863_1471405:2-nf] -therefore we are smitten as we deserve, since it is written: \"And that servant, which knoweth his master's will, and has not obeyed his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.\"[fn-48-P4864_1471750:3-nf] But what stripes, what blows, do we not deserve, when even confessors, who ought to be an example of virtuous life to others, do not maintain discipline?

Hear at least God upbraiding him with this especially. \"Did not I anoint thee for a king, and delivered thee from the hand of Saul, and give thee all that pertained to thy master, and all the house of Israel and Judah, and if it had been little for thee, I would have added thus and thus; and wherefore hast thou done that which was evil in my sight?\"[fn-72-P7257_2221693:26-nf] For not for all sins are there the same punishments, but many and diverse, according to the times, according to the persons, according to their rank, according to their understanding, according to other things besides. And that what I say may be more clear, let one sin be set forth, fornication; and mark how many different punishments I find not from myself, but from the divine Scriptures. Did any one commit fornication before the law, he is differently punished; and this Paul showeth, \"For as many as have sinned without law, shall also perish without law.\"[fn-72-P7258_2222276:27-nf] Did any one commit fornication after the law? He shall suffer more grievous things. \"For as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law.\"[fn-72-P7259_2222562:28-nf] Did any one commit fornication being a priest, he receives from his dignity a very great addition to his punishment. So for this cause, whereas the other women were slain for fornication, the daughters of the priests were burnt; the lawgiver showing the more amply, how great punishment await the priest if he commits this sin. For if on the daughter he inflicts a greater punishment, because of her being a priest's daughter, much more on the man himself who bears the priest's office. Was fornication committed with any violence? she is even freed from punishment. Did One play the harlot being rich, and another being poor? Here again also is a difference. And this is evident from what we have said before concerning David. as any one guilty of fornication after Christ's coming? Should he depart uninitiated, he will suffer a punishment more sore than all those. Was any guilty of fornication after the layer? in this case not even a consolation is left for the sin any more. And this selfsame thing Paul declared when he said, \"He that despised Moses' law dieth without mercy, under two or three witnesses: of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be counted worthy, who hath trodden underfoot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant an unholy thing, and hath done despite to the grace of the Spirit?[fn-72-P7260_2223988:29-nf] Hath any been guilty of fornication, bearing the priest's office now? this above all is the crown of the evil deeds.","title":"Homily LXXV.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":12,"verse":32,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_83_homily_lxxvii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"51","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"And after these virtues let us seek, which together with our own salvation will be able in the greatest degree to profit our neighbor.

Let us not be frightened at that other death, but let us fear this one. But, what is very grievous, many, through a perverse fear of that other, have fallen into this. It has been said to some, Adore idols; for if you do it not, you shall be put to death: or, as Nebuchadnezzar said, If you do not, you shall be thrown into the furnace of flaming fire. Many feared and adored. Shrinking from death, they died. Through fear of the death which cannot be escaped, they fell into that which they might happily have escaped, had they not, unhappily, been afraid of that which is inevitable. As a man, thou art born-art destined to die. Whither wilt thou go to escape death? What wilt thou do to escape it? That thy Lord might comfort thee in thy necessary subjection to death, of His own good pleasure He condescended to die. When thou seest the Christ lying dead, art thou reluctant to die? Die then thou must; thou hast no means of escape. Be it today, be it tomorrow; it is to be-the debt must be paid. What, then, does a man gain by fearing, fleeing, hiding himself from discovery by his enemy? Does he get exemption from death? No, but that he may die a little later. He gets not security against his debt, but asks a respite. Put it off as long as you please, the thing so delayed will come at last. Let us fear that death which the three men feared when they said to the king, \"God is able to deliver us even from that flame; and if not,\" etc.[fn-18-P1847_1161765:23-nf] There was there the fear of that death which the Lord now threatens, when they said, But also if He be not willing openly to deliver us, He can crown us with victory in secret. Whence also the Lord, when on the eve of appointing martyrs and becoming the head-martyr Himself, said, \"Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.\"How \"have they no more that they can do\"? What if, after having slain one, they threw his body to be mangled by wild beasts, and torn to pieces by birds? Cruelty seems still to have something it can do. But to whom is it done? He has departed. The body is there, but without feeling. The tenement lies on the ground, the tenant is gone. And so \"after that they have no more that they can do;\" for they can do nothing to that which is without sensation. \"But fear Him who hath power to destroy both body and soul, in hell fire.\"[fn-18-P1848_1162685:24-nf] Here is the death that He spake of when He said, \"He that keepeth my saying shall never see death.\" Let us keep then, A brethren, His own word in faith, as those who are yet to attain to sight, when the liberty we receive has reached its fullness.","title":"Tractate XLIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":12,"verse":33,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_80_sermon_lxiii_cxiii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"5.

For if they who lived from their labor, and were managers of a workshop, exhibited such profuseness as to be of service to many Churches; what pardon can they expect, who are rich, and yet neglect the poor? For they were not sparing even of their blood for the sake of God's will, but thou art sparing even of scanty sums, and many times sparest not thine own soul. But in regard to the teacher were they so, and not so with regard to the disciples? Nay even this cannot be said. For \"the churches of the Gentiles,\" he says, \"thank them.\" And yet they were of the Jews. But still they had such a clear (eilikrinpwj) faith, as to minister unto them also with all willingness. Such ought women to be, not adorning themselves with \"broidered hair, or gold, or costly array\" (1 Tim. ii. 9), but in these good deeds. For what empress pray, was so conspicuous or so celebrated as this wife of the tent-maker? she is in everybody's mouth, not for ten or twenty years, but until the coming of Christ, and all proclaim her fame for things such as adorn far more than any royal diadem. For what is greater or so great, as to have been a succorer of Paul? at her own peril to have saved the teacher of the world? And consider: how many empresses there are that no one speaks of. But the wife of the tent-maker is everywhere reported of with the tent-maker (meaning perhaps St. Paul); and the width that the sun sees over, is no more of the world than what the glory of this woman runneth unto. Persians, and Scythians, and Thracians, and they who dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth, sing of the Christian spirit of this woman, and bless it.[fn-33-P3360_3089669:10-nf] How much wealth, how many diadems and purples would you not be glad to venture upon obtaining such a testimony? For no one can say either, that in dangers they were of this character, and lavish with their money, and yet neglected the preaching. For he calls them \"fellow-workers and helpers\" on this ground. And this \"chosen vessel\" (Acts ix. 15) does not feel ashamed to call a woman his helper but even finds an honor in doing so. For it is not the sex (fisei) that he minds, but the will is what he honors. What is equal to this ornament? Where now is wealth overflowing on every side? and where the adorning of the person? and where is vainglory? Learn that the dress of woman is not that put about the body, but that which decorates the soul, which is never put off, which does not lie in a chest, but is laid up in the heavens. Look at their labor for the preaching, the crown in martyrdom, the munificence in money, the love of Paul, the charm (filtron) they found in Christ. Compare with this thine own estate, thy anxiety about money, thy vying with harlots (i. e. in dress), thy emulating of the grass,[fn-33-P3361_3090809:11-nf] and then thou wilt see who they were and who thou art. Or rather do not compare only, but vie with this woman, and after laying aside the burdens of grass (xlohj), (for this is what thy costly dressing is), take thou the dress from heaven, and learn whence Priscilla became such as she was. How then did they become so? For two years they entertained Paul as a guest: (Probably Acts xix. 10) and what is there that these two years may not have done for their souls? What am I to do then, you will say because I have not Paul? If thou be minded thou mayest have him in a truer sense than they. For even with them the sight of Paul was not what made them of such a character, but the words of Paul. And so, if thou be so minded, thou shall have both Paul, and Peter, and John, and the whole choir of the Prophets, with the Apostles, associating with thee continually. For take the books of these blessed ones, and hold a continual intercourse with their writings, and they will be able to make thee like the tent-maker's wife. And why speak I of Paul? For if thou wilt, thou mayest have Paul's Master Himself. For through Paul's tongue even He will discourse with thee. And in another way again thou wilt be able to receive this Person, when thou receivest the saints, even when thou tendest those that believe on Him. And so even after their departure thou wilt have many memorials of piety. For even the table at which the saint ate, and a seat on which he sat, and the couch on which he lay knoweth how to pierce[fn-33-P3362_3092420:12-nf] him that received him; even after his departure. How then, think you, was that Shunamite pierced at entering the upper chamber where Elisha abode, when she saw the table, the couch on which the holy man slept; and what religiousness must she have felt come from it?[fn-33-P3363_3092726:13-nf] For had this not been so, she would not have cast the child there when dead, if she had not reaped great benefit from thence. For if so long time after upon entering in where Paul abode, where he was bound, where he sat and discoursed,[fn-33-P3364_3093038:14-nf] we are elevated, and find ourselves starting off from the places to that memory (so Field: Vulg. \"the memory of that day\"); when the circumstances were still fresher, what must those have been likely to feel, who had religiously entertained him? Knowing all this then, let us receive the Saints, that the house may shine, that it may be freed from choking thorns, that the bedchamber may become a haven. And let us receive them, and wash their feet. Thou art not better than Sarah, nor more noble, nor more wealthy, though thou be an empress. For she had three hundred and eighteen homeborn servants, at a time when to have two servants even was to be wealthy. And why do I mention the three hundred and eighteen servants? She had become possessed of the whole world in her seed and in the promises, she had the \"friend of God\" (Is. xli. 8; James ii. 23) for her husband, God Himself as a Patron, a thing greater than any kingdom. And yet, though she was in so illustrious and honorable estate, this woman kneaded the flour, and did all the other servant's offices, and stood by them as they banqueted too in the rank of a servant. Thou art not of nobler birth than Abraham, who yet did the part of domestics after his exploits after his victories, after the honor paid him by the king of Egypt, after driving out the kings of the Persians, and raising the glorious trophies. And look not to this; that in appearance the Saints that lodge with thee are but poor, and as beggars, and in rags many times, but be mindful of that voice which says, \"Inasmuch as ye have done it to the least of these, ye have done it unto me.\" (Matt. xxv. 40.) And, \"Despise not one of these little ones, because their angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven.\" (Matt. xviii. 10.) Receive them then with readiness of mind, bringing as they do ten thousand blessings to thee, through the greeting of peace. (ib. x. 12, 13.) And after Sarah, reflect upon Rebecca also, who both drew water and gave to drink, and called the stranger in, trampling down all haughtiness. However, through this, great were the rewards of hospitality she received! And thou, if thou be so minded, wilt receive even greater than those. For it will not be the fruit of children only that God will give thee, but the heaven, and the blessings there, and a freedom from hell, and a remission of sins. For great, yea, very great, is the fruit of hospitality. (Luke xi. 41.) Thus too Jethro, and that though he was a foreigner, gained for a relation him who with so great power commanded the sea. (Dan. iv. 27; Ex. iii. 1.) For his daughters too drew into his net this honorable prey. (Num. x. 29.) Setting then thy thoughts upon these things, and reflecting upon the manly and heroic[fn-33-P3365_3095907:15-nf] temper of those women, trample upon the gorgeousness of this day, the adornments of dress, the costly jewelry, the anointing with perfumes. And have done with those wanton[fn-33-P3366_3096200:16-nf] and delicate airs, and that mincing walk, and turn all this attentiveness unto the soul, and kindle up in thy mind a longing for the heavens. For should but his love take hold of thee, thou wilt discern the mire and the clay, and ridicule the things now so admired. For it is not even possible for a woman adorned with spiritual attainments to be seeking after this ridiculousness. Having then cast this aside, which wives of the lewder sort of men, and actresses, and singers, have so much ambition in, clothe thee with the love of wisdom, with hospitality, with the succoring of the Saints, with compunction, with continual prayer. These be better than cloth of gold, these more stately than jewels and[fn-33-P3367_3096948:17-nf] than necklaces,[fn-33-P3368_3097017:18-nf] these both make thee of good repute among men, and bring thee great reward with God. This is the dress of the Church, that of the playhouses. This is worthy of the heaven, that, of horses and mules; that is put even round dead corpses, this shineth in a good soul alone wherein Christ dwelleth. Let this then be the dress for us to acquire, that we also may have our praise sung everywhere, and be well-pleasing to Christ, by Whom and with Whom, etc. Amen.

For if they who lived from their labor, and were managers of a workshop, exhibited such profuseness as to be of service to many Churches; what pardon can they expect, who are rich, and yet neglect the poor? For they were not sparing even of their blood for the sake of God's will, but thou art sparing even of scanty sums, and many times sparest not thine own soul. But in regard to the teacher were they so, and not so with regard to the disciples? Nay even this cannot be said. For \"the churches of the Gentiles,\" he says, \"thank them.\" And yet they were of the Jews. But still they had such a clear (eilikrinpwj) faith, as to minister unto them also with all willingness. Such ought women to be, not adorning themselves with \"broidered hair, or gold, or costly array\" (1 Tim. ii. 9), but in these good deeds. For what empress pray, was so conspicuous or so celebrated as this wife of the tent-maker? she is in everybody's mouth, not for ten or twenty years, but until the coming of Christ, and all proclaim her fame for things such as adorn far more than any royal diadem. For what is greater or so great, as to have been a succorer of Paul? at her own peril to have saved the teacher of the world? And consider: how many empresses there are that no one speaks of. But the wife of the tent-maker is everywhere reported of with the tent-maker (meaning perhaps St. Paul); and the width that the sun sees over, is no more of the world than what the glory of this woman runneth unto. Persians, and Scythians, and Thracians, and they who dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth, sing of the Christian spirit of this woman, and bless it.[fn-33-P3360_3089669:10-nf] How much wealth, how many diadems and purples would you not be glad to venture upon obtaining such a testimony? For no one can say either, that in dangers they were of this character, and lavish with their money, and yet neglected the preaching. For he calls them \"fellow-workers and helpers\" on this ground. And this \"chosen vessel\" (Acts ix. 15) does not feel ashamed to call a woman his helper but even finds an honor in doing so. For it is not the sex (fisei) that he minds, but the will is what he honors. What is equal to this ornament? Where now is wealth overflowing on every side? and where the adorning of the person? and where is vainglory? Learn that the dress of woman is not that put about the body, but that which decorates the soul, which is never put off, which does not lie in a chest, but is laid up in the heavens. Look at their labor for the preaching, the crown in martyrdom, the munificence in money, the love of Paul, the charm (filtron) they found in Christ. Compare with this thine own estate, thy anxiety about money, thy vying with harlots (i. e. in dress), thy emulating of the grass,[fn-33-P3361_3090809:11-nf] and then thou wilt see who they were and who thou art. Or rather do not compare only, but vie with this woman, and after laying aside the burdens of grass (xlohj), (for this is what thy costly dressing is), take thou the dress from heaven, and learn whence Priscilla became such as she was. How then did they become so? For two years they entertained Paul as a guest: (Probably Acts xix. 10) and what is there that these two years may not have done for their souls? What am I to do then, you will say because I have not Paul? If thou be minded thou mayest have him in a truer sense than they. For even with them the sight of Paul was not what made them of such a character, but the words of Paul. And so, if thou be so minded, thou shall have both Paul, and Peter, and John, and the whole choir of the Prophets, with the Apostles, associating with thee continually. For take the books of these blessed ones, and hold a continual intercourse with their writings, and they will be able to make thee like the tent-maker's wife. And why speak I of Paul? For if thou wilt, thou mayest have Paul's Master Himself. For through Paul's tongue even He will discourse with thee. And in another way again thou wilt be able to receive this Person, when thou receivest the saints, even when thou tendest those that believe on Him. And so even after their departure thou wilt have many memorials of piety. For even the table at which the saint ate, and a seat on which he sat, and the couch on which he lay knoweth how to pierce[fn-33-P3362_3092420:12-nf] him that received him; even after his departure. How then, think you, was that Shunamite pierced at entering the upper chamber where Elisha abode, when she saw the table, the couch on which the holy man slept; and what religiousness must she have felt come from it?[fn-33-P3363_3092726:13-nf] For had this not been so, she would not have cast the child there when dead, if she had not reaped great benefit from thence. For if so long time after upon entering in where Paul abode, where he was bound, where he sat and discoursed,[fn-33-P3364_3093038:14-nf] we are elevated, and find ourselves starting off from the places to that memory (so Field: Vulg. \"the memory of that day\"); when the circumstances were still fresher, what must those have been likely to feel, who had religiously entertained him? Knowing all this then, let us receive the Saints, that the house may shine, that it may be freed from choking thorns, that the bedchamber may become a haven. And let us receive them, and wash their feet. Thou art not better than Sarah, nor more noble, nor more wealthy, though thou be an empress. For she had three hundred and eighteen homeborn servants, at a time when to have two servants even was to be wealthy. And why do I mention the three hundred and eighteen servants? She had become possessed of the whole world in her seed and in the promises, she had the \"friend of God\" (Is. xli. 8; James ii. 23) for her husband, God Himself as a Patron, a thing greater than any kingdom. And yet, though she was in so illustrious and honorable estate, this woman kneaded the flour, and did all the other servant's offices, and stood by them as they banqueted too in the rank of a servant. Thou art not of nobler birth than Abraham, who yet did the part of domestics after his exploits after his victories, after the honor paid him by the king of Egypt, after driving out the kings of the Persians, and raising the glorious trophies. And look not to this; that in appearance the Saints that lodge with thee are but poor, and as beggars, and in rags many times, but be mindful of that voice which says, \"Inasmuch as ye have done it to the least of these, ye have done it unto me.\" (Matt. xxv. 40.) And, \"Despise not one of these little ones, because their angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven.\" (Matt. xviii. 10.) Receive them then with readiness of mind, bringing as they do ten thousand blessings to thee, through the greeting of peace. (ib. x. 12, 13.) And after Sarah, reflect upon Rebecca also, who both drew water and gave to drink, and called the stranger in, trampling down all haughtiness. However, through this, great were the rewards of hospitality she received! And thou, if thou be so minded, wilt receive even greater than those. For it will not be the fruit of children only that God will give thee, but the heaven, and the blessings there, and a freedom from hell, and a remission of sins. For great, yea, very great, is the fruit of hospitality. (Luke xi. 41.) Thus too Jethro, and that though he was a foreigner, gained for a relation him who with so great power commanded the sea. (Dan. iv. 27; Ex. iii. 1.) For his daughters too drew into his net this honorable prey. (Num. x. 29.) Setting then thy thoughts upon these things, and reflecting upon the manly and heroic[fn-33-P3365_3095907:15-nf] temper of those women, trample upon the gorgeousness of this day, the adornments of dress, the costly jewelry, the anointing with perfumes. And have done with those wanton[fn-33-P3366_3096200:16-nf] and delicate airs, and that mincing walk, and turn all this attentiveness unto the soul, and kindle up in thy mind a longing for the heavens. For should but his love take hold of thee, thou wilt discern the mire and the clay, and ridicule the things now so admired. For it is not even possible for a woman adorned with spiritual attainments to be seeking after this ridiculousness. Having then cast this aside, which wives of the lewder sort of men, and actresses, and singers, have so much ambition in, clothe thee with the love of wisdom, with hospitality, with the succoring of the Saints, with compunction, with continual prayer. These be better than cloth of gold, these more stately than jewels and[fn-33-P3367_3096948:17-nf] than necklaces,[fn-33-P3368_3097017:18-nf] these both make thee of good repute among men, and bring thee great reward with God. This is the dress of the Church, that of the playhouses. This is worthy of the heaven, that, of horses and mules; that is put even round dead corpses, this shineth in a good soul alone wherein Christ dwelleth. Let this then be the dress for us to acquire, that we also may have our praise sung everywhere, and be well-pleasing to Christ, by Whom and with Whom, etc. Amen.

I shall thus leave behind me detailed evidence, easy of apprehension, for the information of industrious students, who in their turn will be able to inform others.

When any one is being accused, it is not right for another, before him or any one else, to contradict the accuser; but if at any time the charge seems groundless to any one, he ought privately to enter into discussion with the accuser, and either produce, or acquire, conviction. Every one ought, as far as he is able, to conciliate one who has ground of complaint against him. No one ought to cherish a grudge against the sinner who repents, but heartily to forgive him.[fn-29-P2942_965744:47-nf] He who says that he has repented of a sin ought not only to be pricked with compunction for his sin, but also to bring forth fruits worthy of repentance.[fn-29-P2943_965917:48-nf] He who has been corrected in first faults, and received pardon, if he sins again prepares for himself a judgment of wrath worse than the former.[fn-29-P2944_966079:49-nf] He, who after the first and second admonition[fn-29-P2945_966146:50-nf] abides in his fault, ought to be brought before the person in authority,[fn-29-P2946_966238:51-nf] if haply after being rebuked by more he may be ashamed.[fn-29-P2947_966420:52-nf] If even thus he fail to be set right he is to be cut off from the rest as one that maketh to offend, and regarded as a heathen and a publican,[fn-29-P2948_966584:53-nf] for the security of them that are obedient, according to the saving, When the impious fall the righteous tremble.[fn-29-P2949_966720:54-nf] He should be grieved over as a limb cut from the body. The sun ought not to go down upon a brother's wrath,[fn-29-P2950_966854:55-nf] lest haply night come between brother and brother, and make the charge stand in the day of judgment. A Christian ought not to wait for an opportunity for his own amendment,[fn-29-P2951_967045:56-nf] because there is no certainty about the morrow; for many after many devices bare not reached the morrow. He ought not to be beguiled by over eating, whence come dreams in the night. He ought not to be distracted by immoderate toil, nor overstep the bounds of sufficiency, as the apostle says, \"Having food and raiment let us be therewith content;\"[fn-29-P2952_967432:57-nf] unnecessary abundance gives appearance of covetousness, and covetousness is condemned as idolatry.[fn-29-P2953_967550:58-nf] A Christian ought not to be a lover of money,[fn-29-P2954_967614:59-nf] nor lay up treasure for unprofitable ends. He who comes to God ought to embrace poverty in all things, and to be riveted in the fear of God, according to the words, \"Rivet my flesh in thy fear, for I am afraid of thy judgments.\"[fn-29-P2955_967884:60-nf] The Lord grant that you may receive what I have said with full conviction and shew forth fruits worthy of the Spirit to the glory of God, by God's good pleasure, and the cooperation of our Lord Jesus Christ.","title":"Letter XXII","author":"St. Basil"}]
