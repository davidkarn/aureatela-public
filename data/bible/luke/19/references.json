Driven from this line of defence you will appeal to the example of the clergy. These, you will say, remain in their cities, and yet they are surely above criticism. Far be it from me to censure the successors of the apostles, who with holy words consecrate the body of Christ, and who make us Christians.[fn-4-P425_78672:217-nf] Having the keys of the kingdom of heaven, they judge men to some extent before the day of judgment, and guard the chastity of the bride of Christ. But, as I have before hinted, the case of monks is different from that of the clergy. The clergy feed Christ's sheep; I as a monk am fed by them. They live of the altar:[fn-4-P426_79025:218-nf] I, if I bring no gift to it, have the axe laid to my root as to that of a barren tree.[fn-4-P427_79149:219-nf] Nor can I plead poverty as an excuse, for the Lord in the gospel has praised an aged widow for casting into the treasury the last two coins that she had.[fn-4-P428_79325:220-nf] I may not sit in the presence of a presbyter;[fn-4-P429_79393:221-nf] he, if I sin, may deliver me to Satan, \"for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved.\"[fn-4-P430_79523:222-nf] Under the old law he who disobeyed the priests was put outside the camp and stoned by the people, or else he was beheaded and expiated his contempt with his blood.[fn-4-P431_79707:223-nf] But now the disobedient person is cut down with the spiritual sword, or he is expelled from the church and torn to pieces by ravening demons. Should the entreaties of your brethren induce you to take orders, I shall rejoice that you are lifted up, and fear lest you may be cast down. You will say: \"If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.\"[fn-4-P432_80110:224-nf] I know that; but you should add what follows: such an one \"must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, chaste, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach, not given to wine, no striker but patient.\"[fn-4-P433_80358:225-nf] After fully explaining the qualifications of a bishop the apostle speaks of ministers of the third degree with equal care. \"Likewise must the deacons be grave,\" he writes, \"not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre, holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. And let these also first be proved; then, let them minister, being found blameless.\"[fn-4-P434_80780:226-nf] Woe to the man who goes in to the supper without a wedding garment. Nothing remains for him but the stern question, \"Friend, how camest thou in hither?\" And when he is speechless the order will be given, \"Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\"[fn-4-P435_81135:227-nf] Woe to him who, when he has received a talent, has bound it in a napkin; and, whilst others make profits, only preserves what he has received. His angry lord shall rebuke him in a moment. \"Thou wicked servant,\" he will say, \"wherefore gavest thou not my money into the bank that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?\"[fn-4-P436_81497:228-nf] That is to say, you should have laid before the altar what you were not able to bear.

For her sake I do not grieve, but for myself I must; my loss is too great to be borne with resignation. Who can recall with dry eyes the glowing faith which induced a girl of twenty to raise the standard of the Cross, and to mourn the loss of her virginity more than the death of her husband? Who can recall without a sigh the earnestness of her prayers, the brilliancy of her conversation, the tenacity of her memory, and the quickness of her intellect? Had you heard her speak Greek you would have deemed her ignorant of Latin; yet when she used the tongue of Rome her words were free from a foreign accent. She even rivalled the great Origen in those acquirements which won for him the admiration of Greece. For in a few months, or rather days, she so completely mastered the difficulties of Hebrew as to emulate her mother's zeal in learning and singing the psalms. Her attire was plain, but this plainness was not, as it often is, a mark of pride. Indeed, her self-abasement was so perfect that she dressed no better than her maids, and was only distinguished from them by the greater ease of her walk. Her steps tottered with weakness, her face was pale and quivering, her slender neck scarcely upheld her head. Still she always had in her hand a prophet or a gospel. As I think of her my eyes fill with tears, sobs impede my voice, and such is my emotion that my tongue cleaves to the roof of my mouth. As she lay there dying, her poor frame parched with burning fever, and her relatives gathered round her bed, her last words were: \"Pray to the Lord Jesus, that He may pardon me, because what I would have done I have not been able to do.\" Be at peace, dear Blaesilla, in full assurance that your garments are always white.[fn-11-P1190_253506:790-nf] For yours is the purity of an everlasting virginity. I feel confident that my words are true: conversion can never be too late. The words to the dying robber are a pledge of this: \"Verily I say unto thee, today shall thou be with me in paradise.\"[fn-11-P1191_253775:791-nf] When at last her spirit was delivered from the burden of the flesh, and had returned to Him who gave it;[fn-11-P1192_253903:792-nf] when, too, after her long pilgrimage, she had ascended up into her ancient heritage, her obsequies were celebrated with customary splendor.

The difficulty is strongly stated, and may well puzzle even those proficient in Scripture; but for all that, it admits of an easy solution. The Lord wept for the fall of Jerusalem,[fn-14-P1438_318117:970-nf] and He would not have done so if He did not love it. He wept for Lazarus because He loved him.[fn-14-P1439_318233:971-nf] The truth is that it was the people who sinned and not the place. The capture of a city is involved in the slaying of its inhabitants. If Jerusalem was destroyed, it was that its people might be punished; if the temple was overthrown, it was that its figurative sacrifices might be abolished. As regards its site, lapse of time has but invested it with fresh grandeur. The Jews of old reverenced the Holy of Holies, because of the things contained in it-the cherubim, the mercy-seat, the ark of the covenant, the manna, Aaron's rod, and the golden altar.[fn-14-P1440_318821:972-nf] Does the Lord's sepulchre seem less worthy of veneration?

It is easy to cast off whatclings to us from without, but a war within our borders involves far greater peril. We have to unfasten things joined together, we have to sunder things firmly united. Zacchus was rich while the apostles were poor. lie restored fourfold all that he had taken and gave to the poor the half of his remaining substance. He welcomed Christ as his guest, and salvation came unto his house.[fn-27-P2797_731693:1992-nf] And yet because he was little of stature and could not reach the apostolic standard of height, he was not numbered with the twelve apostles. Now as regards wealth the apostles gave up nothing at all, but as regards will they one and all gave up the whole world. If we offer to Christ our souls as well as our riches, he will gladly receive our offering. But if we give to God only those things which are without while we give to the devil those things which are within, the division is not fair, and the divine voice says: \"Hast thou not sinned in offering aright, and yet not dividing aright?\"[fn-27-P2798_732312:1993-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":19,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"852","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"2.

From this she went straight on down the hill to Jericho thinking of the wounded man in the gospel, of the savagery of the priests and Levites who passed him by, and of the kindness of the Samaritan, that is, the guardian, who placed the half-dead man upon his own beast and brought him down to the inn of the church.[fn-39-P3975_1069579:2838-nf] She noticed the place called Adomim[fn-39-P3976_1069637:2839-nf] or the Place of Blood, so-called because much blood was shed there in the frequent incursions of marauders.

This at least is a fair inference from the case of Esau who for his old sins is condemned to lead a lower life. And concerning the heavenly bodies we must make a similar acknowledgment. The soul of the sun-or whatever else you like to call it-does not date its existence from the creation of the world; it already existed before it entered its shining and glowing body. So also with the moon and stars. From antecedent causes they have been made subject to vanity not willingly but for future reward,[fn-47-P4731_1286149:3375-nf] and are forced to do not their own will but the creator's who has assigned to them their several spheres.\"7. Hellfire, moreover, and the torments with which holy scripture threatens sinners he explains not as external punishments but as the pangs of guilty consciences when by God's power the memory of our transgressions is set before our eyes. \"The whole crop of our sins grows up afresh from seeds which remain in the soul, and all our dishonourable and undutiful acts are again pictured before our gaze. Thus it is the fire of conscience and the stings of remorse which torture the mind as it looks back on former self-indulgence.\" And again: \"but perhaps this coarse and earthly body ought to be described as mist and darkness; for at the end of this world and when it becomes necessary to pass into another, the like darkness will lead to the like physical birth.\" In speaking thus he clearly pleads for the transmigration of souls as taught by Pythagoras and Plato.[fn-47-P4732_1287147:3376-nf] . And at the end of the second book in dealing with our perfection he has said: \"when we shall have made such progress as not only to cease to be flesh or body but perhaps also to cease to be souls our perfect intelligence and perception, undimmed with any mist of passion, will discern reasonable and intelligible substances face to face.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":19,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_11_book_i_","source_chapter":42,"source_paragraph":"152","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"This reasoning will carry more weight, after I have collected the mass of Scripture testimonies which I have undertaken to adduce.

For let us ponder over our conscience itself, (to see) how different a man feels himself when he chances to be deprived of his wife. He savours spiritually. If he is making prayer to the Lord, he is near heaven. If he is bending over the Scriptures, he is \"wholly in them.\"[fn-10-P1030_260165:52-nf] If he is singing a psalm, he satisfies himself.[fn-10-P1031_260239:53-nf] If he is adjuring a demon, he is confident in himself. Accordingly, the apostle added (the recommendation of) a temporary abstinence for the sake of adding an efficacy to prayers,[fn-10-P1032_260437:54-nf] that we might know that what is profitable \"for a time\" should be always practised by us, that it may be always profitable. Daily, every moment, prayer is necessary to men; of course continence (is so) too, since prayer is necessary. Prayer proceeds from conscience, If the conscience blush, prayer blushes. It is the spirit which conducts prayer to God. If the spirit be self-accused of a blushing[fn-10-P1033_260860:55-nf] conscience, how will it have the hardihood to conduct prayer to the altar; seeing that, if prayer. blush, the holy minister (of prayer) itself is suffused too? For there is a prophetic utterance of the Old Testament: \"Holy shall ye be, because God is holy; \"[fn-10-P1034_261138:56-nf] and again: \"With the holy thou shall be sanctified; and with the innocent man thou shalt be innocent; and with the elect, elect.\"[fn-10-P1035_261324:57-nf] For it is our duty so to walk in the Lord's discipline as is \"worthy,\"[fn-10-P1036_261473:58-nf] not according to the filthy concupiscences of the flesh. For so, too, does the apostle say, that \"to savour according to the flesh is death, but to savour according to the spirit is life eternal in Jesus Christ our Lord.\"[fn-10-P1037_261745:59-nf] Again, through the holy prophetess Prisca[fn-10-P1038_261827:60-nf] the Gospel is thus preached: that \"the holy minister knows how to minister sanctity.\" \"For purity,\" says she, \"is harmonious, and they. see visions; and, turning their face downward, they even hear manifest voices, as salutary as they are withal secret.\" If this dulling (of the spiritual faculties), even when the carnal nature is allowed room for exercise in first marriage, averts the Holy Spirit; how much more when it is brought into play in second marriage!","title":"V.

Therefore, since the Jews still contend that the Christ is not yet come, whom we have in so many ways approved[fn-24-P2457_801076:306-nf] to be come, let the Jews recognise their own fate, -a fate which they were constantly foretold as destined to incur after the advent of the Christ, on account of the impiety with which they despised and slew Him.

For this reason it is that Eunomius says, \"He who in the last days became man did not take upon Himself the man made up of soul and body.\" But, after searching through all the inspired and sacred Scripture, I do not find any such statement as this, that the Creator of all things, at the time of His ministration here on earth for man, took upon Himself flesh only without a soul. Under stress of necessity, then, looking to the object contemplated by the plan of salvation, to the doctrines of the Fathers, and to the inspired Scriptures, I will endeavour to confute the impious falsehood which is being fabricated with regard to this matter. The Lord came \"to seek and to save that which was lost[fn-12-P1204_656584:193-nf] .\" Now it was not the body merely, but the whole man, compacted of soul and body, that was lost: indeed, if we are to speak more exactly, the soul was lost sooner than the body. For disobedience is a sin, not of the body, but of the will: and the will properly belongs to the soul, from which the whole disaster of our nature bad its beginning, as the threat of God, that admits of no falsehood, testifies in the declaration that, in the day that they should eat of the forbidden fruit, death without respite would attach to the act. Now since the condemnation of man was twofold, death correspondingly effects in each part of our nature the deprivation of the twofold life that operates in him who is thus mortally stricken. For the death of the body consists in the extinction of the means of sensible perception, and in the dissolution of the body into its kindred elements: but \"the soul that sinneth,\" he saith, \"it shall die[fn-12-P1205_657543:194-nf] .\" Now sin is nothing else than alienation from God, Who is the true and only life. Accordingly the first man lived many hundred years after his disobedience, and yet God lied not when He said, \"In the day that ye eat thereof ye shall surely die[fn-12-P1206_657814:195-nf] .\" For by the fact of his alienation from the true life, the sentence of death was ratified against him that self-same day: and after this, at a much later time, there followed also the bodily death of Adam. He therefore Who came for this cause that He might seek and save that which was lost, (that which the shepherd in the parable calls the sheep,) both finds that which is lost, and carries home on His shoulders the whole sheep, not its skin only, that He may make the man of God complete, united to the deity in body and in soul. And thus He Who was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin, left no part of our nature which He did not take upon Himself. Now the soul is not sin though it is capable of admitting sin into it as the result of being ill-advised: and this He sanctifies by union with Himself for this end, that so the lump may be holy along with the first-fruits. Wherefore also the Angel, when informing Joseph of the destruction of the enemies of the Lord, said, \"They are dead which sought the young Child's life[fn-12-P1207_658887:196-nf] ,\" (or \"soul\"): and the Lord says to the Jews, \"Ye seek to kill Me, a man that hath told you the truth[fn-12-P1208_659073:197-nf] .\" Now by \"Man\" is not meant the body of a man only, but that which is composed of both, soul and body. And again, He says to them, \"Are ye angry at Me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the Sabbath day[fn-12-P1209_659388:198-nf] ?\" And what He meant by \"every whit whole,\" He showed in the other Gospels, when He said to the man who was let down on a couch in the midst, \"Thy sins be forgiven thee,\" which is a healing of the soul, and, \"Arise and walk[fn-12-P1210_659636:199-nf] ,\" which has regard to the body: and in the Gospel of S. John, by liberating the soul also from its own malady after He had given health to the body, where He saith, \"Thou art made whole, sin no more[fn-12-P1211_659932:200-nf] ,\" thou, that is, who hast been cured in both, I mean in soul and in body. For so too does S. Paul speak, \"for to make in Himself of twain one new man[fn-12-P1212_660105:201-nf] .\" And so too He foretells that at the time of His Passion He would voluntarily detach His soul from His body, saying, \"No man taketh\" my soul \"from Me, but I lay it down of Myself: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again[fn-12-P1213_660370:202-nf] .\" Yea, the prophet David also, according to the interpretation of the great Peter, said with foresight of Him, \"Thou wilt not leave My soul in hell, neither wilt Thou suffer Thine Holy One to see corruption[fn-12-P1214_660678:203-nf] ,\" while the Apostle Peter thus expounds the saying, that \"His soul was not left in hell, neither His flesh did see corruption.\" For His Godhead, alike before taking flesh and in the flesh and after His Passion, is immutably the same, being at all times what It was by nature, and so continuing for ever. But in the suffering of His human nature the Godhead fulfilled the dispensation for our benefit by severing the soul for a season from the body, yet without being Itself separated from either of those elements to which it was once for all united, and by joining again the elements which had been thus parted, so as to give to all human nature a beginning and an example which it should follow of the resurrection from the dead, that all the corruptible may put on incorruption, and all the mortal may put on immortality, our first-fruits having been transformed to the Divine nature by its union with God, as Peter said, \"This same Jesus Whom ye crucified, hath God made both Lord and Christ[fn-12-P1215_661720:204-nf] ;\" and we might cite many passages of Scripture to support such a position, showing how the Lord, reconciling the world to Himself by the Humanity of Christ, apportioned His work of benevolence to men between His soul and His body, willing through His soul and touching them through His body. But it would be superfluous to encumber our argument by entering into every detail.","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":19,"verse":38,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_109_the_account_of_st_john_the_theologian","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"14","folder":"ANF-08","text":"And after all these wonderful things had come to pass through the mother of God, and ever-virgin Mary the mother of the Lord, while we the apostles were with her in Jerusalem, the Holy Spirit said to us: You know that on the Lord's day the good news was brought to the Virgin Mary by the archangel Gabriel; and on the Lord's day the Saviour was born in Bethlehem; and on the Lord's day the children of Jerusalem came forth with palm branches to meet him, saying, Hosanna in the highest, blessed is[fn-86-P8651_2817627:11-nf] He that cometh in the name of the Lord;[fn-86-P8652_2817680:12-nf] and on the Lord's day He rose from the dead; and on the Lord's day He will come to judge the living and the dead; and on the Lord's day He will come out of heaven, to the glory and honour of the departure of the holy glorious virgin who brought Him forth.

And while she is saying this, the apostles, having gone up to her feet and adored, say: O mother of the Lord, leave a blessing to the world, since thou art going away from it. For thou hast blessed it, and raised it up when it was ruined, by bringing forth the Light of the world. And the mother of the Lord prayed, and in her prayer spoke thus: O God, who through Thy great goodness hast sent from the heavens Thine only-begotten Son to dwell in my humble body, who hast deigned to be born of me, humble as I am, have mercy upon the world, and every soul that calls upon Thy name.

And at this miracle which had come to pass all the people of the Jews who beheld it cried out: Verily, He that was brought forth by thee is the true God, O mother of God, ever-virgin Mary. And Jephonias himself, when Peter ordered him, that the wonderful things of God might be showed forth, stood up behind the couch, and cried out: Holy Mary, who broughtest forth Christ who is God, have mercy upon me. And Peter turned and said to him: In the name of Him who was born of her, thy hands which have been taken away from thee, will be fixed on again.

For, indeed, the oil with which he was anointed, and from that chrism he is called Christ, is to be taken in a mystical sense, and is to be understood as a great mystery; which David himself venerated so much in him, that he trembled with smitten heart when, being hid in a dark cave, which Saul also entered when pressed by the necessity of nature, he had come secretly behind him and cut off a small piece of his robe, that he might be able to prove how he had spared him when he could have killed him, and might thus remove from his mind the suspicion through which he had vehemently persecuted the holy David, thinking him his enemy. Therefore he was much afraid test he should be accused of violating so great a mystery in Saul, because he had thus meddled even his clothes. For thus it is written: \"And David's heart smote him because he had taken away the skirt of his cloak.\"[fn-30-P3091_1713246:49-nf] But to the men with him, who advised him to destroy Saul thus delivered up into his hands, he saith, \"The Lord forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, the Lord's christ, to lay my hand upon him, because he is the Lord's christ.\" Therefore he showed so great reverence to this shadow of what was to come, not for its own sake, but for the sake of what it prefigured. Whence also that which Samuel says to Saul, \"Since thou hast not kept my commandment which the Lord commanded thee, whereas now the Lord would have prepared thy kingdom over Israel for ever, yet now thy kingdom shall not continue for thee; and the Lord will seek Him a man after His own heart, and the Lord will command him to be prince over His people, because thou hast not kept that which the Lord commanded thee,\"[fn-30-P3092_1714062:50-nf] is not to be taken as if God had settled that Saul himself should reign for ever, and afterwards, on his sinning, would not keep this promise; nor was He ignorant that he would sin, but He had established his kingdom that it might be a figure of the eternal kingdom. Therefore he added, \"Yet now thy kingdom shall not continue for thee.\" Therefore what it signified has stood and shall stand; but it shall not stand for this man, because he himself was not to reign for ever, nor his offspring; so that at least that word \"for ever\" might seem to be fulfilled through his posterity one to another. \"And the Lord,\" he saith, \"will seek Him a man,\" meaning either David or the Mediator of the New Testament,[fn-30-P3093_1714794:51-nf] who was figured in the chrism with which David also and his offspring was anointed. But it is not as if He knew not where he was that God thus seeks Him a man, but, speaking through a man, He speaks as a man, and in this sense seeks us. For not only to God the Father, but also to His Only-begotten, who came to seek what was lost,[fn-30-P3094_1715145:52-nf] we had been known already even so far as to be chosen in Him before the foundation of the world.[fn-30-P3095_1715262:53-nf] \"He will seek Him\" therefore means, He will have His own (just as if He had said, Whom He already has known to be His own He will show to others to be His friend).

And when these things shall come to pass, ye shall look up, and raise your heads; for your redemption hath come near,\" that is, at the time of the kingdom, of which the parable itself treats.[fn-69-P6917_2012481:1563-nf] \"So likewise ye, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.\"[fn-69-P6918_2012620:1564-nf] This will be the great day of the Lord, and of the glorious coming of the Son of man from heaven, of which Daniel wrote: \"Behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven,\"[fn-69-P6919_2012830:1565-nf] etc. \"And there was given unto Him the kingly power,\"[fn-69-P6920_2012907:1566-nf] which (in the parable) \"He went away into a far country to receive for Himself,\" leaving money to His servants wherewithal to trade and get increase[fn-69-P6921_2013079:1567-nf] -even (that universal kingdom of) all nations, which in the Psalm the Father had promised to give to Him: Ask of me, and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance.\"[fn-69-P6922_2013285:1568-nf] \"And all that glory shall serve Him; His dominion shall be an everlasting one, which shall not be taker from Him, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed,\"[fn-69-P6923_2013471:1569-nf] because in it \"men shall not die, neither shall they marry, but be like the angels.\"[fn-69-P6924_2013579:1570-nf] It is about the same advent of the Son of man and the benefits thereof that we read in Habakkuk: \"Thou wentest forth for the salvation of Thy people, even to save Thine anointed ones,[fn-69-P6925_2013789:1571-nf] -in other words, those who shall look up and lift their heads, being redeemed in the time of His kingdom. Since, therefore, these descriptions of the promises, on the one hand, agree together, as do also those of the great catastrophes, on the other-both in the predictions of the prophets and the declarations of the Lord, it will be impossible for you to interpose any distinction between them, as if the catastrophes could be referred to the Creator, as the terrible God, being such as the good god (of Marcion) ought not to permit, much less expect-whilst the promises should be ascribed to the good god, being such as the Creator, in His ignorance of the said god, could not have predicted. If, however, He did predict these promises as His own, since they differ in no respect from the promises of Christ, He will be a match in the freeness of His gifts with the good god himself; and evidently no more will have been promised by your Christ than by my Son of man. (If you examine) the whole passage of this Gospel Scripture, from the inquiry of the disciples[fn-69-P6926_2014878:1572-nf] down to the parable of the fig-tree[fn-69-P6927_2014939:1573-nf] you will find the sense in its connection suit in every point the Son of man, so that it consistently ascribes to Him both the sorrows and the joys, and the catastrophes and the promises; nor can you separate them from Him in either respect. For as much, then, as there is but one Son of man whose advent is placed between the two issues of catastrophe and promise, it must needs follow that to that one Son of man belong both the judgments upon the nations, and the prayers of the saints. He who thus comes in midway so as to be common to both issues, will terminate one of them by inflicting judgment on the nations at His coming; and will at the same time commence the other by fulfilling the prayers of His saints: so that if (on the one hand) you grant that the coming of the Son of man is (the advent) of my Christ, then, when you ascribe to Him the infliction of the judgments which precede His appearance, you are compelled also to assign to Him the blessings which issue from the same. If (on the other hand) you will have it that it is the coming of your Christ, then, when you ascribe to him the blessings which are to be the result of his advent, you are obliged to impute to him likewise the infliction of the evils which precede his appearance. For the evils which precede, and the blessings which immediately follow, the coming of the Son of man, are both alike indissolubly connected with that event. Consider, therefore, which of the two Christs you choose to place in the person of the Son of man, to whom you may refer the execution of the two dispensations. You make either the Creator a most beneficent God, or else your own god terrible in his nature! Reflect, in short, on the picture presented in the parable: \"Behold the fig-tree, and all the trees; when they produce their fruit, men know that summer is at hand. So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is very near.\"[fn-69-P6928_2016904:1574-nf] Now, if the fructification of the common trees[fn-69-P6929_2016977:1575-nf] be an antecedent sign of the approach of summer, so in like manner do the great conflicts of the world indicate the arrival of that kingdom which they precede. But every sign is His, to whom belong the thing of which it is the sign; and to everything is appointed its sign by Him to whom the thing belongs. If, therefore, these tribulations are the signs of the kingdom, just as the maturity of the trees is of the summer, it follows that the kingdom is the Creator's to whom are ascribed the tribulations which are the signs of the kingdom. Since the beneficent Deity had premised that these things must needs come to pass, although so terrible and dreadful, as they had been predicted by the law and the prophets, therefore He did not destroy the law and the prophets, when He affirmed that what had been foretold therein must be certainly fulfilled. He further declares, \"that heaven and earth shall not pass away till all things be fulfilled.\"[fn-69-P6930_2017948:1576-nf] What things, pray, are these? Are they the things which the Creator made? Then the elements will tractably endure the accomplishment of their Maker's dispensation. If, however, they emanate from your excellent god, I much doubt whether[fn-69-P6931_2018207:1577-nf] the heaven and earth will peaceably allow the completion of things which their Creator's enemy has determined! If the Creator quietly submits to this, then He is no \"jealous God.\" But let heaven and earth pass away, since their Lord has so determined; only let His word remain for evermore! And so Isaiah predicted that it should.[fn-69-P6932_2018558:1578-nf] Let the disciples also be warned, \"lest their hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and cares of this world; and so that day come upon them unawares, like a snare \"[fn-69-P6933_2018761:1579-nf] -if indeed they should forget God amidst the abundance and occupation of the world. Like this will be found the admonition of Moses,-so that He who delivers from \"the snare\" of that day is none other than He who so long before addressed to men the same admonition[fn-69-P6934_2019117:1580-nf] Some places there were in Jerusalem where to teach; other places outside Jerusalem whither to retire[fn-69-P6935_2019252:1581-nf] -\"in the day-time He was teaching in the temple; \"just as He had foretold by Hosea: \"In my house did they find me, and there did I speak with them.\"[fn-69-P6936_2019424:1582-nf] \"But at night He went out to the Mount of Olives.\" For thus had Zechariah pointed out: \"And His feet shall stand in that day on the Mount of Olives.\"[fn-69-P6937_2019658:1583-nf] Fit hours for an audience there also were. \"Early in the morning\"[fn-69-P6938_2019747:1584-nf] must they resort to Him, who (having said by Isaiah, \"The Lord giveth me the tongue of the learned\") added, \"He hath appointed me the morning, and hath also given me an ear to hear.\"[fn-69-P6939_2019953:1585-nf] Now if this is to destroy the prophets,[fn-69-P6940_2020013:1586-nf] what will it be to fulfil them?","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":19,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_28_book_ii_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"84","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Listen, then, for a little while, and observe what is involved in this question. Catholics say that human nature was created good by the good God as Creator; but that, having been corrupted by sin, it needs the physician Christ. The Manicheans affirm, that human nature was not created by God good, and corrupted by sin; but that man was formed by the prince of eternal darkness of a mixture of two natures which had ever existed-one good and the other evil. The Pelagians and Coelestians say that human nature was created good by the good God; but that it is still so sound and healthy in infants at their birth, that they have no need at that age of Christ's medicine. Recognise, then, your name in your dogma; and cease from intruding upon the catholics, who refute you, a name and a dogma which belong to others. For truth rejects both parties-the Manicheans and yourselves. To the Manicheans it says: \"Have ye not read that He which made man at the beginning, made them male and female; and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What, therefore, God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.\"[fn-41-P4137_1559926:21-nf] Now Christ shows, in this passage, that God is both the Creator of man, and the uniter in marriage of husband and wife; whereas the Manicheans deny both these propositions. To you, however, He says: \"The Son of man is come to seek and to save that which is lost.\"[fn-41-P4138_1560211:22-nf] But you, admirable Christians as you are, answer Christ: \"If you came to seek and to save that which was lost, then you did not come for infants; for they were not lost, but are born in a state of salvation: go to older men; we give you a rule from your own words: `They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.'\"[fn-41-P4139_1560563:23-nf] Now, as it happens, the Manichean, who says that man has evil mixed in his nature, must wish his good soul at any rate to be saved by Christ; whereas you contend that there is in infants nothing to be sired by Christ, since they are already safe.[fn-41-P4140_1560829:24-nf] And thus the Manichean besets human nature with his detestable censure, and you with your cruel praise. For whosoever shall believe your laudation, will never bring their babes to the Saviour. Entertaining such impious views as these, of what use is it that you fearlessly face that which is enacted for you[fn-41-P4141_1561343:25-nf] in order to induce salutary fear and to treat you as a human being, and not as that poor animal of yours which was surrounded with the coloured feathers to be driven into the hunting toils? Need was that you should hold the truth, and, on account of zeal for it, have no fear; but, as things are, you evade fear in such wise that, if you feared, you would rather run away from the net of the malignant one than run into it. The reason why your catholic mother alarms you is, because she fears for both you and others from you; and if by the help of her sons who possess any authority in the State she acts with a view to make you afraid, she does so, not from cruelty, but from love. You, however; are a very brave man; and you deem it the coward's part to be afraid of men. Well then, fear God; and do not try with such obstinacy to subvert the ancient foundations of the catholic faith. Although I could even wish that spirited temper of yours would entertain some little fear of human authority, at least in the present case. I could wish, I say, that it would rather tremble through cowardice than perish through audacity.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":19,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_28_book_ii_","source_chapter":44,"source_paragraph":"150","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"I have an answer ready for all this; but before I give it, I wish the reader carefully to notice, that the result of the opinions of these persons is, that no Saviour is necessary for infants, whom they deem to be entirely without any sins to be saved from. This vast perversion of the truth, so hostile to God's great grace, which is given through our Lord Jesus Christ, who \"came to seek and to save what was lost,\"[fn-43-P4306_1630850:91-nf] tries to insinuate its way into the hearts of the unintelligent by eulogizing the works of God; that is, by its eulogy of human nature, of human seed, of marriage, of sexual intercourse, of the fruits of matrimony-which are all of them good things. I will not say that he adds the praise of lust; because he too is ashamed even to name it, so that it is something else, and not it, which he seems to praise. By this method of his, not distinguishing between the evils which have accrued to nature and the goodness of nature's very self, he does not, indeed, show it to be sound (because that is untrue), but he does not permit its diseased condition to be healed. And, therefore, that first proposition of ours, to the effect that the good thing, even the human being, which is born of adultery, does not excuse the sin of adulterous connection, he allows to be true; and this point, which occasions no question to arise between us, he even defends and strengthens (as he well may) by his similitude of the thief who sows the seed which he stole, and out of which there arises a really good harvest. Our other proposition, however, that \"the good of marriage cannot be blamed for the original sin which is derived from it,\" he will not admit to be true; if, indeed, he assented to it, he would not be a Pelagian heretic, but a catholic Christian. \"Certainly,\" says he, \"if evil arises from marriage, it may be blamed, nay, cannot be excused; and you place its work and fruit under the devil's power, because everything which is the cause of evil is itself without good.\" And in addition to this, he contrived other arguments to show that good could not possibly be the cause of evil; and from this he drew the inference, that marriage, which is a good, is not the cause of evil; and that consequently from it no man could be born in a sinful state, and having need of a Saviour: just as if we said that marriage is the cause of sin, though it is true that the human being which is born in wedlock is not born without sin. Marriage was instituted not for the purpose of sinning, but of producing children. Accordingly the Lord's blessing on the married state ran thus: \"Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.\"[fn-43-P4307_1633092:92-nf] The sin, however, which is derived to children from marriage does not belong to marriage, but to the evil which accrues to the human agents, from whose union marriage comes into being. The truth is, both the evil of shameful lust can exist without marriage, and marriage might have been without it. It appertains, however, to the condition of the body (not of that life, but) of this death, that marriage cannot exist without it though it may exist without marriage. Of course that lust of the flesh which causes shame has existence out of the married state, whenever it urges men to the commission of adultery, chambering and uncleanness, so utterly hostile to the purity of marriage; or again, when it does not commit any of these things, because the human agent gives no permission or assent to their commission, but still rises and is set in motion and creates disturbance, and (especially in dreams) effects the likeness of its own veritable work, and reaches the end of its own emotion. Well, now, this is an evil which is not even in the married state actually an evil of marriage; but it has this apparatus all ready in the body of this death, even against its own will, which is indispensable no doubt for the accomplishment of that which it does will. The evil in question, therefore, does not accrue to marriage from its own institution, which was blessed; but entirely from the circumstance that sin entered into the world by one man, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for in him all sinned.[fn-43-P4308_1634631:93-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":19,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_28_book_ii_","source_chapter":52,"source_paragraph":"166","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"As to the passage, which he seemed to himself to indite in a pious vein, as it were, \"If nature is of God, there cannot be original sin in it,\" would not another person seem even to him to give a still more pious turn to it, thus: \"If nature is of God, there cannot arise any sin in it?\" And yet this is not true. The Manicheans, indeed, meant to assert this, and they endeavoured to steep in all sorts of evil the very nature of God itself, and not His creature, made out of nothing. For evil arose in nothing else than what was good-not, however, the supreme and unchangeable good which is God's nature, but that which was made out of nothing by the wisdom of God. This, then, is the reason why man is claimed for a divine work; for he would not be man unless he were made by the operation of God. But evil would not exist in infants, if evil had not been committed by the wilfulness of the first man, and original sin derived from a nature thus corrupted. It is not true, then, as he puts it, \"He is completely a Manichean who maintains original sin;\" but rather,he is completely a Pelagian who does not believe in original sin. For it is not simply from the time when the pestilent opinions of Manichaeus began to grow that in the Church of God infants about to be baptized were for the first time exorcised with exsufflation,-which ceremonial was intended to show that they were not removed into the kingdom of Christ without first being delivered from the power of darkness;[fn-43-P4349_1652384:110-nf] nor is it in the books of Manichaeus that we read how \"the Son of man come to seek and to save that which was lost,\"[fn-43-P4350_1652520:111-nf] or how \"by one man sin entered into the world,\"[fn-43-P4351_1652589:112-nf] with those other similar passages which we have quoted above; or how God \"visits the sins of the fathers upon the children;\"[fn-43-P4352_1652733:113-nf] or how it is written in the Psalm, \"I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me;\"[fn-43-P4353_1652852:114-nf] or again, how \"man was made like unto vanity: his days pass away like a shadow;\"[fn-43-P4354_1652951:115-nf] or again, \"behold, Thou hast made my days old, and my existence as nothing before Thee; nay, every man living is altogether vanity;\"[fn-43-P4355_1653105:116-nf] or how the apostle says, \"every creature was made subject to vanity;\"[fn-43-P4356_1653196:117-nf] or how it is written in the book of Ecclesiastes, \"vanity of vanities; all is vanity: what profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?\"[fn-43-P4357_1653377:118-nf] and in the book of Ecclesiasticus, \"a heavy yoke is upon the sons of Adam from the day that they go out of their mother's womb to the day that they return to the mother of all things;\"[fn-43-P4358_1653585:119-nf] or how again the apostle writes, \"in Adam all die;\"[fn-43-P4359_1653659:120-nf] or how holy Job says, when speaking about his own sins, \"for man that is born of a woman is short-lived and full of wrath: as the flower of grass, so does he fall; and he departs like a shadow, nor shall he stay.

Not even one, even if his life should be but of one day upon the earth.\"[fn-43-P4360_1654101:121-nf] Now when he speaks of uncleanness here, the mere perusal of the passage is enough to show that he meant sin to be under-stood. It is plain from the words, of what he is speaking. The same phrase and sense occur in the prophet Zechariah, in the place where \"the filthy garments\" are removed from off the high priest, and it is said to him, \"I have taken away thy sins.\"[fn-43-P4361_1654491:122-nf] Well now, I rather think that all these passages, and others of like import, which point to the fact that man is born in sin and under the curse, are not to be read among the dark recesses of the Manicheans, but in the sunshine of catholic truth.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":19,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_28_book_ii_","source_chapter":58,"source_paragraph":"178","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But whatever opinion he may entertain about the shame-causing concupiscence of the flesh, I must request your attention to what he has said respecting infants (and it is in their behalf that we labour), as to their being supposed to need a Saviour, if they are not to die without salvation. I repeat his words once more: \"You assert,\" says he to me, \"that they, indeed, who have not been ever born might possibly have been good; those, however, who have peopled the world, and for whom Christ died, you decide to be the work of the devil, born in a disordered state, and guilty from the very beginning.\" Would that he only solved the entire controversy as he unties the knot of this question! For will he pretend to say that he merely spoke of adults in this passage? Why, the subject in hand is about infants, about human beings at their birth; and it is about these that he raises odium against us, because they are defined by us as guilty from the very first, because we declare them to be guilty, since Christ died for them. And why did Christ die for them if they are not guilty? It is entirely from them, yes, from them, we shall find the reason, wherefore he thought odium should be raised against me. He asks: \"How are infants guilty, for whom Christ died?\" We answer: Nay, how are infants not guilty, since Christ died for them? This dispute wants a judge to determine it. Let Christ be the Judge, and let Him tell us what is the object which has profited by His death? \"This is my blood,\" He says, \"which shall be shed[fn-43-P4390_1668446:133-nf] for many for the remission of sins.\"[fn-43-P4391_1668502:134-nf] Let the apostle, too, be His assessor in the judgment; since even in the apostle it is Christ Himself that speaks. Speaking of God the Father, he exclaims: \"He who spared. not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all!\"[fn-43-P4392_1668748:135-nf] I suppose that he describes Christ as so delivered up for us all, that infants in this matter are not separated from ourselves. But what need is there to dwell on this point, out of which even he no longer raises a contest? For the truth is, he not only confesses that Christ died even for infants, but he also reproves us out of this admission, because we say that these same infants are guilty for whom Christ died. Now, then, let the apostle, who says that Christ was delivered up for us all, also tell us why Christ was delivered up for us. \"He was delivered,\" says he, \"for our offences, and rose again for our justification.\"[fn-43-P4393_1669402:136-nf] If, therefore, as even this man both confesses and professes, both admits and objects, infants, too, are included amongst those for whom Christ was delivered up; and if it was for our sins that Christ was delivered up, even infants, of course, must have original sins, for whom Christ was delivered up; He must have something in them to heal, who (as Himself affirms) is not needed as a Physician by the whole, but by the sick;[fn-43-P4394_1669850:137-nf] He must have a reason for saving them, seeing that He came into the world, as the Apostle Paul says, \"to save sinners;\"[fn-43-P4395_1669992:138-nf] He must have something in them to remit, who testifies that He shed His blood \"for the remission of sins;\"[fn-43-P4396_1670120:139-nf] He must have good reason for seeking them out, who \"came,\" as He says, \"to seek and to save that which was lost;\"[fn-43-P4397_1670257:140-nf] the Son of man must find in them something to destroy, who came for the express purpose, as the Apostle John says, \"that He might destroy the works of the devil.\"[fn-43-P4398_1670441:141-nf] Now to this salvation of infants He must be an enemy, who asserts their innocence, in such a way as to deny them the medicine which is required by the hurt and wounded.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":19,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":68,"source_paragraph":"279","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"127.

But how much less cause then for any disquietude ought there to be, when we see that the one writer has mentioned the ass to which the others have omitted to refer, in such a manner as at the same time not to leave unnoticed also the colt of which the rest have spoken! In fine, where it is possible to suppose both objects to have been included in the occurrence, there is no real antagonism, although the one writer may specify only the one thing, and another only the other.

For in the days of fasting are found your own wills; for either ye torment those who are subjected to you, or ye fast for strifes and judgments, or ye strike your neighbours with fists.

Thus an irreligious Pagan might bring the same reproaches against Christ in the Gospel, as Faustus brings against God in the Old Testament. He might say that Christ lacked foresight, not only because He was astonished at the faith of the centurion, but because He chose Judas as a disciple who proved disobedient to His commands; as Faustus objects to the precept given in Paradise, which, as it turned out, was not obeyed. He might also cavil at Christ's not knowing who touched Him, when the woman suffering from an issue of blood touched the hem of His garment; as Faustus blames God for not knowing where Adam had hid himself. If this ignorance is implied in God's saying, \"Where art thou, Adam?\"[fn-20-P2054_1206281:22-nf] the same may be said of Christ's asking, \"Who touched me?\"[fn-20-P2055_1206358:23-nf] The Pagans also might call Christ timid and envious, in not wishing five of the ten virgins to gain eternal life by entering into His kingdom, and in shutting them out, so that they knocked in vain in their entreaty to have the door opened, as if forgetful of His own promise, \"Knock, and it shall be opened unto you;\"[fn-20-P2056_1206701:24-nf] as Faustus charges God with fear and envy in not admitting man after his sin to eternal life. Again, he might call Christ greedy of the blood, not of beasts, but of men, because he said, \"He that loseth his life for my sake, shall keep it unto life eternal;\"[fn-20-P2057_1206979:25-nf] as Faustus reproaches God in reference to those animal sacrifices which prefigured the sacrifice of blood-shedding by which we are redeemed. He might also accuse Christ of jealousy, because in narrating His driving the buyers and sellers out of the temple, the evangelist quotes as applicable to Him the words, \"The jealousy of Thine house hath eaten me up;\"[fn-20-P2058_1207356:26-nf] as Faustus accuses God of jealousy in forbidding sacrifices to be offered to other gods. He might say that Christ was angry with both His friends and His enemies: with His friends, because He said, \"The servant that knows his lord's will, and doeth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes;\" and with His enemies, because He said, \"If any one shall not receive you, shake off against him the dust of your shoes; verily I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for Sodom in the day of judgment than for that city;\"[fn-20-P2059_1207896:27-nf] as Faustus accuses God of being angry at one time with His friends, and at another with His enemies; both of whom are spoken of thus by the apostle: \"They that have sinned without law shall perish without law, and they that have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law.\"[fn-20-P2060_1208194:28-nf] Or he might say that Christ shed the blood of many without mercy, for a slight offense or for nothing. For to a Pagan there would appear to be little or no harm in not having a wedding garment at the marriage feast, for which our King in the Gospel commanded a man to be bound hand and foot, and cast into outer darkness;[fn-20-P2061_1208534:29-nf] or in not wishing to have Christ for a king, which is the sin of which Christ says, \"Those that would not have me to reign over them, bring hither and slay before me;\"[fn-20-P2062_1208727:30-nf] as Faustus blames God in the Old Testament for slaughtering thousands of human beings for slight offenses, as Faustus calls them, or for nothing. Again, if Faustus finds fault with God's threatening to come with the sword, and to spare neither the righteous nor the wicked, might not the Pagan. find as much fault with the words of the Apostle Paul, when he says of our God,\" He spared not His own Son, but gave Him up for us all;\"[fn-20-P2063_1209178:31-nf] or of Peter, when, in exhorting the saints to be patient in the midst of persecution and slaughter, he says, \"It is time that judgment begin from the house of God; and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that believe not the gospel of the Lord? And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and sinner appear?\"[fn-20-P2064_1209546:32-nf] What can be more righteous than the Only-Begotten, whom nevertheless the Father did not spare? And what can be plainer than that the righteous also are not spared, but chastised with manifold afflictions, as is clearly implied in the words, \"If the righteous scarcely are saved\"? As it is said in the Old Testament, \"Whom the Lord loveth He correcteth, and chastiseth every son whom He receiveth;\"[fn-20-P2065_1209968:33-nf] and, \"If we receive good at the hand of the Lord, shall we not also receive evil?\"[fn-20-P2066_1210071:34-nf] So we read also in the New Testament, \"Whom I love I rebuke and chasten;\"[fn-20-P2067_1210162:35-nf] and, \"If we judge ourselves, we shall not be judged of the Lord; but when we are judged, we are corrected of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.\"[fn-20-P2068_1210346:36-nf] If a Pagan were to make such objections to the New Testament, would not the Manichaeans try to answer them, though they themselves make similar objections to the Old Testament? But supposing them able to answer the Pagan, how absurd it would be to defend in the one Testament what they find fault with in the other! But if they could not answer the objections of the Pagan, why should they not allow in both Testaments, instead of in one only, that what appears wrong to unbelievers, from their ignorance, should be believed to be right by pious readers even when they also are ignorant?","title":"Book XXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":19,"verse":27,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_126_oration_on_the_psalms_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"2","folder":"ANF-06","text":"I.

Man, undoubtedly. The entire man, or only a part of him? The whole man, of course. In fact, since the transgression which caused man's ruin was committed quite as much by the instigation of the soul from concupiscence as by the action of the flesh from actual fruition, it has marked the entire man with the sentence of transgression, and has therefore made him deservedly amenable to perdition. So that he will be wholly saved, since he has by sinning been wholly lost. Unless it be true that the sheep (of the parable) is a\" lost\" one, irrespective of its body; then its recovery may be effected without the body. Since, however, it is the bodily substance as well as the soul, making up the entire animal, which was carried on the shoulders of the Good Shepherd, we have here unquestionably an example how man is restored in both his natures. Else how unworthy it were of God to bring only a moiety of man to salvation-and almost less than that; whereas the munificence of princes of this world always claims for itself the merit of a plenary grace! Then must the devil be understood to be stronger for injuring man, ruining him wholly? and must God have the character of comparative weakness, since He does not relieve and help man in his entire state? The apostle, however, suggests that \"where sin abounded, there has grace much more abounded.\"[fn-100-P10005_2774976:224-nf] How, in fact, can he be regarded as saved, who can at the same time be said to be lost-lost, that is, in the flesh, but saved as to his soul? Unless, indeed, their argument now makes it necessary that the soul should be placed in a \"lost\" condition, that it may be susceptible of salvation, on the ground that is properly saved which has been lost. We, however, so understand the soul's immortality as to believe it \"lost,\" not in the sense of destruction, but of punishment, that is, in hell. And if this is the case, then it is not the soul which salvation will affect, since it is \"safe\"already in its own nature by reason of its immortality, but rather the flesh, which, as all readily allow, is subject to destruction. Else, if the soul is also perishable (in this sense), in other words, not immortal-the condition of the flesh-then this same condition ought in all fairness to benefit the flesh also, as being similarly mortal and perishable, since that which perishes the Lord purposes to save. I do not care now to follow the clue of our discussion, so far as to consider whether it is in one of his natures or in the other that perdition puts in its claim on man, provided that salvation is equally distributed over the two substances, and makes him its aim in respect of them both. For observe, in which substance so-ever you assume man to have perished, in the other be does not perish. He will therefore be saved in the substance in which he does not perish, and yet obtain salvation in that in which he does perish. You have (then) the restoration of the entire man, inasmuch as the Lord purposes to save that part of him which perishes, whilst he will not of course lose that portion which cannot be lost, Who will any longer doubt of the safety of both natures, when one of them is to obtain salvation, and the other is not to lose it? And, still further, the Lord explains to us the meaning of the thing when He says: \"I came not to do my own will, but the Father's, who hath sent me.\"[fn-100-P10006_2776999:225-nf] What, I ask, is that will? \"That of all which He hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.\"[fn-100-P10007_2777152:226-nf] Now, what had Christ received of the Father but that which He had Himself put on? Man, of course, in his texture of flesh and soul. Neither, therefore, of those parts which He has received will He allow to perish; nay, no considerable portion-nay, not the least fraction, of either. If the flesh be, as our opponents slightingly think, but a poor fraction, then the flesh is safe, because not a fraction of man is to perish; and no larger portion is in danger, because every portion of man is in equally safe keeping with Him. If, however, He will not raise the flesh also up at the last day, then He will permit not only a fraction of man to perish, but (as I will venture to say, in consideration of so important a part) almost the whole of him.But when He repeats His words with increased emphasis, \"And this is the Father's will, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on Him, may have eternal life: and I will raise him up at the last day,\"[fn-100-P10008_2778125:227-nf] -He asserts the full extent of the resurrection. For He assigns to each several nature that reward which is suited to its services: both to the flesh, for by it the Son was \"seen; \"and to the soul, for by it He was \"believed on.\" Then, you will say, to them was this promise given by whom Christ was \"seen.\" Well, be it so; only let the same hope flow on from them to us! For if to them who saw, and therefore believed, such fruit then accrued to the operations of the flesh and the soul, how much more to us! For more \"blessed,\" says Christ, \"are they who have not seen, and yet have believed; \"[fn-100-P10009_2778738:228-nf] since, even if the resurrection of the flesh must be denied to them, it must at any rate be a fitting boon to us, who are the more blessed.

Moreover, they think that the natives of other countries are to be given them as the ministers of their pleasures, whom they are to employ either as tillers of the field or builders of walls, and by whom their ruined and fallen city is again to be raised up; and they think that they are to receive the wealth of the nations to live on, and that they will have control over their riches; that even the camels of Midian and Kedar will come, and bring to them gold, and incense, and precious stones. And these views they think to establish on the authority of the prophets by those promises which are written regarding Jerusalem; and by those passages also where it is said, that they who serve the Lord shall eat and drink, but that sinners shall hunger and thirst; that the righteous shall be joyful, but that sorrow shall possess the wicked.

Whence also, even in this life, those who devote themselves with great labour to the pursuits of piety and religion, although obtaining only some small fragments from the numerous and immense treasures of divine knowledge, yet, by the very circumstance that their mind and soul is engaged in these pursuits, and that in the eagerness of their desire they outstrip themselves, do they derive much advantage; and, because their minds are directed to the study and love of the investigation of truth, are they made fitter for receiving the instruction that is to come; as if, when one would paint an image, he were first with a light pencil to trace out the outlines of the coming picture, and prepare marks for the reception of the features that are to be afterwards added, this preliminary sketch in outline is found to prepare the way for the laying on of the true colours of the painting; so, in a measure, an outline and sketch may be traced on the tablets of our heart by the pencil of our Lord Jesus Christ. And therefore perhaps is it said, \"Unto every one that hath shall be given, and be added.\"[fn-67-P6747_1409273:196-nf] By which it is established, that to those who possess in this life a kind of outline of truth and knowledge, shall be added the beauty of a perfect image in the future.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":19,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_39_the_great_catechism","source_chapter":49,"source_paragraph":"152","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But, as far as what has been already said, the instruction of this Catechism does not seem to me to be yet complete. For we ought, in my opinion, to take into consideration the sequel of this matter; which many of those who come to the grace of baptism[fn-40-P4072_2704620:118-nf] overlook, being led astray, and self-deceived, and indeed only seemingly, and not really, regenerate. For that change in our life which takes place through regeneration will not be change, if we continue in the state in which we were. I do not see how it is possible to deem one who is still in the same condition, and in whom there has been no change in the distinguishing features of his nature, to be any other than he was, it being palpable to every one that it is for a renovation and change of our nature that the saving birth is received. And yet human nature does not of itself admit of any change in baptism; neither the reason, nor the understanding, nor the scientific faculty, nor any other peculiar characteristic of man is a subject for change. Indeed the change would be for the worse if any one of these properties of our nature were exchanged away[fn-40-P4073_2705905:119-nf] for something else. If, then, the birth from above is a definite refashioning of the man, and yet these properties do not admit of change, it is a subject for inquiry what that is in him, by the changing of which the grace of regeneration is perfected. It is evident that when those evil features which mark our nature have been obliterated a change to a better state takes place. If, then, by being \"washed,\" as says the Prophet[fn-40-P4074_2706395:120-nf] , in that mystic bath we become \"clean\" in our wills and \"put away the evil\" of our souls, we thus become better men, and are changed to a better state. But if, when the bath has been applied to the body, the soul has not cleansed itself from the stains of its passions and affections, but the life after initiation keeps on a level with the uninitiate life, then, though it may be a bold thing to say, yet I will say it and will not shrink; in these cases the water is but water, for the gift of the Holy Ghost in no ways appears in him who is thus baptismally born; whenever, that is, not only the deformity of anger[fn-40-P4075_2707032:121-nf] , or the passion of greed, or the unbridled and unseemly thought, with pride, envy, and arrogance, disfigures the Divine image, but the gains, too, of injustice abide with him, and the woman he has procured by adultery still even after that ministers to his pleasures. If these and the like vices, after, as before, surround the life of the baptized, I cannot see in what respects he has been changed; for I observe him the same man as he was before. The man whom he has unjustly treated, the man whom he has falsely accused, the man whom he has forcibly deprived of his property, these, as far as they are concerned, see no change in him though he has been washed in the laver of baptism. They do not hear the cry of Zacchaeus from him as well: \"If I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore fourfold[fn-40-P4076_2708002:122-nf] .\" What they said of him before his baptism, the same they now more fully declare; they call him by the same names, a covetous person, one who is greedy of what belongs to others, one who lives in luxury at the cost of men's calamities. Let such an one, therefore, who remains in the same moral condition as before, and then babbles to himself of the beneficial change he has received from baptism, listen to what Paul says: \"If a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself[fn-40-P4077_2708532:123-nf] .\" For what you have not become, that you are not. \"As many as received Him,\" thus speaks the Gospel of those who have been born again, \"to them gave He power to become the sons of God[fn-40-P4078_2708736:124-nf] .\" Now the child born of any one is entirely of a kindred nature with his parent. If, then, you have received God, if you have become a child of God, make manifest in your disposition the God that is in you, manifest in yourself Him that begot you. By the same marks whereby we recognize God, must this relationship to God of the son so born be exhibited. \"He openeth His hand and filleth every living thing with His good pleasure.\" \"He passeth over transgressions.\" \"He repenteth Him of the evil.\" \"The Lord is good to all, and bringeth not on us His anger every day.\" \"God is a righteous Lord, and there isno injustice in Him[fn-40-P4079_2709386:125-nf] ;\" and all other sayings of the like kind which are scattered for our instruction throughout the Scripture;-if you live amidst such things as these, you are a child of God indeed; but if you continue with the characteristic marks of vice in you, it is in vain that you babble to yourself of your birth from above. Prophecy will speak against you and say, \"You are a `son of man,' not a son of the Most High. You `love vanity, and seek after leasing.' Know you not in what way man is `made admirable[fn-40-P4080_2710046:126-nf] '?

For when the Lord was in mortal flesh, He hungered, He thirsted: at that time when He hungered and thirsted, He was taken in as a guest; those who had the means, ministered unto Him of their substance, as we read in the Gospel. Zacchaeus entertained Him as his guest: he was saved from his disease by entertaining the Physician. From what disease? The disease of avarice. For he was very rich, and the chief of the publicans.

To cling to God continually, and as you say inseparably to hold fast to meditation on Him, is impossible for a man while still in this weak flesh of ours. But we ought to be aware on what we should have the purpose of our mind fixed, and to what goal we should ever recall the gaze of our soul: and when the mind can secure this it may rejoice; and grieve and sigh when it is withdrawn from this, and as often as it discovers itself to have fallen away from gazing on Him, it should admit that it has lapsed from the highest good, considering that even a momentary departure from gazing on Christ is fornication. And when our gaze has wandered ever so little from Him, let us turn the eyes of the soul back to Him, and recall our mental gaze as in a perfectly straight direction. For everything depends on the inward frame of mind, and when the devil has been expelled. from this, and sins no longer reign in it, it follows that the kingdom of God as founded in us, as the Evangelist says \"The kingdom of God cometh not with observation, nor shall men say Lo here, or lo there: for verily I say unto you that the kingdom of God is within you.\"[fn-35-P3539_1321607:14-nf] But nothing else can be \"within you,\" but knowledge or ignorance of truth, and delight either in vice or in virtue, through which we prepare a kingdom for the devil or for Christ in our heart: and of this kingdom the Apostle describes the character, when he says \"For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-35-P3540_1322000:15-nf] And so if the kingdom of God is within us, and the actual kingdom of God is righteousness and peace and joy, then the man who abides in these is most certainly in the kingdom of God, and on the contrary those who live in unrighteousness, and discord, and the sorrow that worketh death, have their place in the kingdom of the devil, and in hell and death. For by these tokens the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the devil are distinguished: and in truth if lifting up our mental gaze on high we would consider that state in which the heavenly powers live on high, who are truly in the kingdom of God, what should we imagine it to be except perpetual and lasting joy? For what is so specially peculiar and appropriate to true blessedness as constant calm and eternal joy? And that you may be quite sure that this, which we say, is really so, not on my own authority but on that of the Lord, hear how very clearly He describes the character and condition of that world: \"Behold,\" says He, \"I create new beavers and a new earth: and the former things shall not be remembered nor come into mind. But ye shall be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create.\"[fn-35-P3541_1323178:16-nf] And again \"joy and gladness shall be found therein: thanksgiving and the voice of praise, and there shall be month after month, and Sabbath after Sabbath.\"[fn-35-P3542_1323356:17-nf] And again: \"they shall obtain joy and gladness; and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.\"[fn-35-P3543_1323471:18-nf] And if you want to know more definitely about that life and the city of the saints, hear what the voice of the Lord proclaims to the heavenly Jerusalem herself: \"I will make,\" says He, \"thine officers peace and thine overseers righteousness. Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, desolation nor destruction within thy borders. And salvation shall take possession of thy walls, and praise of thy gates. The sun shall be no more thy light by day, neither shall the brightness of the moon give light to thee: but the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and thy God thy glory. Thy sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: but the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended:\"[fn-35-P3544_1324238:19-nf] and therefore the holy Apostle does not say generally or without qualification that every joy is the kingdom of God, but markedly and emphatically that joy alone which is \"in the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-35-P3545_1324450:20-nf] For he was perfectly aware of another detestable joy, of which we hear \"the world shall rejoice,\"[fn-35-P3546_1324571:21-nf] and \"woe unto you that laugh, for ye shall mourn.\"[fn-35-P3547_1324644:22-nf] In fact the kingdom of heaven must be taken in a threefold sense, either that the heavens shall reign, i.e., the saints over other things subdued, according to this text, \"Be thou over five cities, and thou over ten;\"[fn-35-P3548_1324883:23-nf] and this which is said to the disciples: \"Ye shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel:\"[fn-35-P3549_1325022:24-nf] or that the heavens themselves shall begin to be reigned over by Christ, when \"all things are subdued unto Him,\" and God begins to be \"all in all:\"[fn-35-P3550_1325193:25-nf] or else that the saints shall reign in heaven with the Lord.","title":"I.

And abstinence from vicious acts is found, somehow, [to result in] the diminution and extinction of vicious propensities, their energy being destroyed by inaction. And this is the import of \"Sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and come, follow Me\"[fn-66-P6685_2035299:28-nf] -that is, follow what is said by the Lord. Some say that by what \"thou hast\" He designated the things in the soul, of a nature not akin to it, though how these are bestowed on the poor they are not able to say. For God dispenses to all according to desert, His distribution being righteous. Despising, therefore, the possessions which God apportions to thee in thy magnificence, comply with what is spoken by me; haste to the ascent of the Spirit, being not only justified by abstinence from what is evil, but in addition also perfected, by Christlike beneficence.[fn-66-P6686_2035902:29-nf] In this instance He convicted the man, who boasted that he had fulfilled the injunctions of the law, of not loving his neighbour; and it is by beneficence that the love which, according to the gnostic ascending scale, is Lord of the Sabbath, proclaims itself.[fn-66-P6687_2036187:30-nf] We must then, according to my view, have recourse to the word of salvation neither from fear of punishment nor promise of a gift, but on account of the good itself. Such, as do so, stand on the right hand of the sanctuary; but those who think that by the gift of what is perishable they shall receive in exchange what belongs to immortality are in the parable of the two brothers called \"hirelings.\" And is there not some light thrown here on the expression \"in the likeness and image,\" in the fact that some live according to the likeness of Christ, while those who stand on the left hand live according to their image? Thereare then two things proceeding from the truth, one root lying beneath both,-the choice being, however, not equal, or rather the difference that is in the choice not being equal. To choose by way of imitation differs, as appears to me, from the choice of him who chooses according to knowledge, as that which is set on fire differs from that which is illuminated. Israel, then, is the light of the likeness which is according to the Scripture. But the image is another thing. What means the parable of Lazarus, by showing the image of the rich and poor? And what the saying, \"No man can serve two masters, God and Mammon? \"-the Lord so terming the love of money. For instance, the covetous, who were invited, responded not to the invitation to the supper, not because of their possessing property, but of their inordinate affection to what they possessed. \"The foxes,\" then, have holes. He called those evil and earthly men who are occupied about the wealth which is mined and dug from the ground, foxes. Thus also, in reference to Herod: \"Go, tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and perform cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.\"[fn-66-P6688_2038149:31-nf] For He applied the name \"fowls of the air\" to those who were distinct from the other birds-those really pure, those that have the power of flying to the knowledge of the heavenly Word. For not riches only, but also honour, and marriage, and poverty, have ten thousand cares for him who is unfit for them.[fn-66-P6689_2038474:32-nf] And those cares He indicated in the parable of the fourfold seed, when He said that \"the seed of the word which fell unto the thorns\" and hedges was choked by them, and could not bring forth fruit. It is therefore necessary to learn how to make use of every occurrence, so as by a good life, according to knowledge, to be trained for the state of eternal life. For it said, \"I saw the wicked exalted and towering as the cedars of Lebanon; and I passed,\" says the Scripture, \"and, lo, he was not; and I sought him, and his place was not found. Keep innocence, and look on uprightness: for there is a remnant to the man of peace.\"[fn-66-P6690_2039123:33-nf] Such will he be who believes unfeignedly with his whole heart, and is tranquil in his whole soul. \"For the different people honour me with their lips, but their heart is far from the Lord.\"[fn-66-P6691_2039337:34-nf] \"They bless with their mouth, but they curse in their heart.\"[fn-66-P6692_2039442:35-nf] \"They loved Him with their mouth, and lied to Him with their tongue; but their heart was not right with Him, and they were not faithful to His covenant.\" Wherefore \"let the false lips become speechless, and let the Lord destroy the boastful tongue: those who say, We shall magnify our tongue, and our lips are our own; who is Lord over us? For the affliction of the poor and the groaning of the needy now will I arise, saith the Lord; I will set him in safety; I will speak out in his case.\"[fn-66-P6693_2039952:36-nf] For it is to the humble that Christ belongs, who do not exalt themselves against His flock. \"Lay not up for yourselves, therefore, treasures on the earth, where moth and rust destroy, and thieves break through and steal,\"[fn-66-P6694_2040193:37-nf] says the Lord, in reproach perchance of the covetous, and perchance also of those who are simply anxious and full of cares, and those too who indulge their bodies. For amours, and diseases, and evil thoughts \"break through\" the mind and the whole man. But our true \"treasure\" is where what is allied to our mind is, since it bestows the communicative power of righteousness, showing that we must assign to the habit of our old conversation what we have acquired by it, and have recourse to God, beseeching mercy. He is, in truth, \"the bag that waxeth not old,\" the provisions of eternal life, \"the treasure that faileth not in heaven.\"[fn-66-P6695_2040848:38-nf] \"For I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,\"[fn-66-P6696_2040918:39-nf] saith the Lord. And they say those things to those who wish to be poor for righteousness' sake. For they have heard in the commandment that \"the broad and wide way leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in by it.\"[fn-66-P6697_2041161:40-nf] It is not of anything else that the assertion is made, but of profligacy, and love of women, and love of glory, and ambition, and similar passions. For so He says, \"Fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee; and whose shall those things be which thou hast prepared? \"[fn-66-P6698_2041459:41-nf] And the commandment is expressed in these very words, \"Take heed, therefore, of covetousness. For a man's life does not consist in the abundance of those things which he possesses. For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? \"[fn-66-P6699_2041801:42-nf] \"Wherefore I say, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for your body, what ye shall put on. For your life is more than meat, and your body than raiment.\"[fn-67-P6700_2041996:43-nf] And again, \"For your Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.\" \"But seek first the kingdom of heaven, and its righteousness,\" for these are the great things, and the things which are small and appertain to this life \"shall be added to you.\"[fn-67-P6701_2042286:44-nf] Does He not plainly then exhort us to follow the gnostic life, and enjoin us to seek the truth in word and deed? Therefore Christ, who trains the soul, reckons one rich, not by his gifts, but by his choice. It is said, therefore, that Zaccheus, or, according to some, Matthew, the chief of the publicans, on hearing that the Lord had deigned to come to him, said, \"Lord, and if I have taken anything by false accusation, I restore him fourfold; \"on which the Saviour said, \"The Son of man, on coming to-day, has found that which was lost.\"[fn-67-P6702_2042866:45-nf] Again, on seeing the rich cast into the treasury according to their wealth, and the widow two mites, He said \"that the widow had cast in more than they all,\" for \"they had contributed of their abundance, but she of her destitution.\" And because He brought all things to bear on the discipline of the soul, He said, \"Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.\"[fn-67-P6703_2043264:46-nf] And the meek are those who have quelled the battle of unbelief in the soul, the battle of wrath, and lust, and the other forms that are subject to them. And He praises those meek by choice, not by necessity. For there are with the Lord both rewards and\" many mansions,\" corresponding to men's lives. \"Whosoever shall receive,\" says He, \"a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward; and whosoever shall receive a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward; and whoso shall receive one of the least of these my disciples, shall not lose his reward.\"[fn-67-P6704_2043896:47-nf] And again, the differences of virtue according to merit, and the noble rewards, He indicated by the hours unequal in number; and in addition, by the equal reward given to each of the labourers-that is, salvation, which is meant by the penny-He indicated the equality of justice; and the difference of those called He intimated, by those who worked for unequal portions of time. They shall work, therefore, in accordance with the appropriate mansions of which they have been deemed worthy as rewards, being fellow-workers in the ineffable administration and service.[fn-67-P6705_2044484:48-nf] \"Those, then,\" says Plato, \"who seem called to a holy life, are those who, freed and released from those earthly localities as from prisons, have reached the pure dwelling-place on high.\" In clearer terms again he expresses the same thing: \"Those who by philosophy have been sufficiently purged from those things, live without bodies entirely for all time. Although they are enveloped in certain shapes; in the case of some, of air, and others, of fire.\" He adds further: \"And they reach abodes fairer than those, which it is not easy, nor is there sufficient time now to describe.\" Whence with reason, \"blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted; \"[fn-67-P6706_2045253:49-nf] for they who have repented of their former evil life shall attain to\"the calling\" (klh=sin), for this is the meaning of being comforted (paraklhqh=nai). And there are two styles of penitents.[fn-67-P6707_2045462:50-nf] That which is more common is fear on account of what is done; but the other which is more special, the shame which the spirit feels in itself arising from conscience. Whether then, here or elsewhere (for no place is devoid of the beneficence of God), He again says, \"Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.\" And mercy is not, as some of the philosophers have imagined, pain on account of others' calamities, but rather something good, as the prophets say. For it is said, \"I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.\"[fn-67-P6708_2046183:51-nf] And He[fn-67-P6709_2046229:52-nf] means by the merciful, not only those who do acts of mercy, but those who wish to do them, though they be not able; who do as far as purpose is concerned. For sometimes we wish by the gift of money or by personal effort to do mercy, as to assist one in want, or help one who is sick, or stand by one who is in any emergency; and are not able either from poverty, or disease, or old age (for this also is natural disease), to carry out our purpose, in reference to the things to which we are impelled, being unable to conduct them to the end we wished. Those, who have entertained the wish whose purpose is equal, share in the same honour with those who have the ability, although others have the advantage in point of resources.[fn-67-P6710_2046980:53-nf] And since there are two paths of reaching the perfection of salvation, works and knowledge, He called the\"pure in heart blessed, for they shall see God.\"[fn-67-P6711_2047230:54-nf] And if we really look to the truth of the matter, knowledge is the purification of the leading faculty of the soul, and is a good activity. Some things accordingly are good in themselves, and others by participation in what is good, as we say good actions are good. But without things intermediate which hold the place of material, neither good nor bad actions are constituted, such I mean as life, and health, and other necessary things or circumstantials. Pure then as respects corporeal lusts, and pure in respect of holy thoughts, he means those are, who attain to the knowledge of God, when the chief faculty of the soul has nothing spurious to stand in the way of its power. When, therefore, he who partakes gnostically of this holy quality devotes himself to contemplation, communing in purity with the divine, he enters more nearly into the state of impassible identity, so as no longer to have science and possess knowledge, but to be science and knowledge.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":19,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_63_book_viii_","source_chapter":76,"source_paragraph":"232","folder":"ANF-04","text":"And if Celsus would have us to lead armies in defence of\nour country, let him know that we do this too, and that not for\nthe purpose of being seen by men, or of vainglory.

Brethen, return in thought to your own homes. I speak of carnal, I speak of earthly things; I speak after the manner of men, for the infirmity of your flesh. Many of you have, many of you wish to have, many, though you wish not to have, still have had wives; many who do not at all wish to have wives, are born of the wives of your fathers. This is a feeling that touches every heart. There is no man so alien from mankind in human affairs as not to feel what I say. Suppose that a man, having set out on a journey, had commended his bride to the care of his friend: \"See, I pray thee, thou art my dear friend; see to it, lest in my absence some other may perchance be loved in my stead.\" Then what sort of a person must he be, who, while the guardian of the bride or wife of his friend, does indeed endeavor that none other be loved, but if he wishes himself to be loved instead of his friend, and desires to enjoy her who was committed to his care, how detestable must he appear to all mankind! Let him see her gazing out of the window, or joking with some one somewhat too heedlessly, he forbids her as one who is jealous. I see him jealous, but let me see for whom he is jealous; whether for his absent friend or for his present self. Think that our Lord Jesus Christ has done this. He has committed His bride to the care of His friend; He has set out on a journey to a far country to receive a kingdom, as He says Himself in the Gospel,[fn-7-P799_417065:11-nf] but yet is present in His majesty. Let the friend who has gone beyond the sea be deceived; and if he is deceived, woe to him who deceives! Why do men attempt to deceive God,-God who looks at the hearts of all, and searches the secrets of all? But some heretic shows himself, and says, \"'Tis I that give, 'tis I that sanctify, 'tis I that justify; go not thou to that other sect.\" He does well indeed to be jealous, but see for whom. \"Go not thou to idols,\" saith he,-he is rightly jealous; \"nor to diviners,\"-still rightly jealous. Let us see for whom he is jealous: \"What I give is holy, because it is I that give it; he is baptized whom I baptize; he whom I baptize not is not baptized.\" Hear thou the friend of the bridegroom, learn to be jealous for thy friend; hear His voice who is \"He that baptizeth.\" Why desire to arrogate to thyself what is not thine? Is he so very absent who has left here his bride? Knowest thou not, that He who rose from the dead is sitting at the right hand of the Father? If the Jews despised Him hanging on the tree, dost thou despise Him sitting in heaven? Be assured, beloved, that I suffer great grief of this matter; but, as I have said, I leave the rest to your thoughts. I cannot utter it if I speak the whole day. If I bewail it the whole day, I do not enough. I cannot utter it, if I should have, as the prophet says, \"a fountain of tears;\" and were I changed into tears, and to become all tears, were I turned into tongues, and to become all tongues, it were not enough.","title":"Tractate XIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":19,"verse":26,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_69_book_vii_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"232","folder":"ANF-02","text":"But it is not doubting in reference to God, but believing, that is the foundation of knowledge.

The lesson of the Holy Gospel which has just been read, has given us an alarming warning, lest we have leaves only, and have no fruit. That is, in few words, lest words be present and deeds be wanting. Very terrible!

For without doubt, the Lord Christ foresaw that a certain tree would deservedly become withered, because it would have leaves, and would have no fruit. That tree is the synagogue, not that which was called, but that which was reprobate. For out of it also was called the people of God, who in sincerity and truth waited in the Prophets for the salvation of God, Jesus Christ. And forasmuch as it waited infaith, it was thought worthy[fn-47-P4781_2051680:2-nf] to know Him when He was present. For out of it came the Apostles, out of it came the whole multitude of those who went before the ass of the Lord, and said, \"Hosanna to the Son of David, blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the Lord.\"[fn-47-P4782_2051930:3-nf] There was a great company then of believing Jews, a great company of those who believed in Christ before He shed His Blood for them.

Of this number were those four thousand Jews who believed, after that the disciples and those who were with them, filled with the Holy Ghost, spake with the tongues of all nations,[fn-47-P4784_2052597:5-nf] and in that diversity of tongues announced in a way beforehand, that the Church should be throughout all nations.

But they lay hid here and there among thorns, as though wasted and dispersed by the wolves; and because they lay hid among thorns, He did not come to find them, save when torn by the thorns of His Passion; yet come He did, He found, He redeemed them. They had slain, not Him so much, as themselves. They were saved by Him who was slain for them. For, as the Apostles spake, they were pricked;[fn-47-P4786_2053320:7-nf] they were pricked in conscience, who had pricked Him with the spear; and being pricked they sought for counsel, received it when it was given, repented, found grace, and believing drunk that Blood which in their fury they had shed. But they who have remained in this bad and barren race, even unto this day, and shall remain unto the end, were figured in that tree. You come to them at this day, and find with them all the writings of the Prophets. But these are but leaves; Christ is an hungred, and He seeketh for fruit; but findeth no fruit among them, because He doth not find Himself among them. For He hath no fruit, who hath not Christ. And he hath not Christ, who holdeth not to Christ's unity, who hath not charity. And so by this chain he hath no fruit who hath not charity.

For in that the Lord died for sinners, perchance even he might have found salvation if he had not hastened to hang himself. But that evil heart, which was now given up to thievish frauds, and now busied with treacherous designs, had never entertained aught of the proofs of the Saviour's mercy.

Also in the priest Melchizedek we see prefigured the sacrament of the sacrifice of the Lord, according to what divine Scripture testifies, and says, \"And Melchizedek, king of Salem, brought forth bread and wine.\"[fn-59-P5962_1873433:6-nf] Now he was a priest of the most high God, and blessed Abraham. And that Melchizedek bore a type of Christ, the Holy Spirit declares in the Psalms, saying from the person of the Father to the Son: \"Before the morning star I begat Thee; Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek; \"[fn-59-P5963_1873747:7-nf] which order is assuredly this coming from that sacrifice and thence descending; that Melchizedek was a priest of the most high God; that he offered wine and bread; that he blessed Abraham. For who is more a priest of the most high God than our Lord Jesus Christ, who offered a sacrifice to God the Father, and offered that very same thing which Melchizedek had offered, that is, bread and wine, to wit, His body and blood? And with respect to Abraham, that blessing going before belonged to our people. For if Abraham believed in God, and it was accounted unto him for righteousness, assuredly whosoever believes in God and lives in faith is found righteous, and already is blessed in faithful Abraham, and is set forth as justified; as the blessed Apostle Paul proves, when he says, \"Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness. Ye know, then, that they which are of faith, these are the children of Abraham. But the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles through faith, pronounced before to Abraham that all nations should be blessed in him; therefore they who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.\"[fn-59-P5964_1874916:8-nf] Whence in the Gospel we find that \"children of Abraham are raised from stones, that is, are gathered from the Gentiles.\"[fn-59-P5965_1875055:9-nf] And when the Lord praised Zacchaeus, He answered and said \"This day is salvation come to this house, forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham.\"[fn-59-P5966_1875217:10-nf] In Genesis, therefore, that the benediction, in respect of Abraham by Melchizedek the priest, might be duly celebrated, the figure of Christ's sacrifice precedes, namely, as ordained in bread and wine; which thing the Lord, completing and fulfilling, offered bread and the cup mixed with wine, and so He who is the fulness of truth fulfilled the truth of the image prefigured.","title":"Epistle LXII.","author":"Cyprian"},{"chapter":19,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_94_tractate_lxxxix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"4. But it is also a worthy subject of inquiry, whether those who met the words they heard with contempt, and even with opposition, and that not merely by contradicting them, but also by persecuting in their hatred those from whom they heard them, are to be reckoned among those in regard to whom the words, \"they shall be judged by the law,\" convey somewhat of a milder sound. But if it is one thing to perish without the law, and another to be judged by the law; and the former is the heavier, the latter the lighter punishment: such, without a doubt, are not to have their place assigned in that lighter measure of punishment; for, so far from sinning in the law, they utterly refused to accept the law of Christ, and, as far as in them lay, would have had it altogether annihilated. But those that sin in the law, are such as are in the law, that is, who accept it, and confess that it is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good;[fn-30-P3046_1720949:6-nf] but fail through infirmity in fulfilling what they cannot doubt is most righteously enjoined therein. These are they in regard to whose fate there may perhaps be some distinction made from the perdition of those who are without the law: and yet if the apostle's words, \"they shall be judged by the law,\" are to be understood as meaning, they shall not perish, what a wonder if it were so For his discourse was not about infidels and believers to lead him to say so, but about Gentiles and Jews, both of whom, certainly, if they find not salvation in that Saviour who came to seek that which was lost,[fn-30-P3047_1721567:7-nf] shall doubtless become the prey of perdition; although it may be said that some shall perish in a more terrible, others in a more mitigated sense; in other words, that some shall suffer a heavier, and others a lighter penalty in their perdition. For he is rightly said to perish as regards God, whoever is separated by punishment from that blessedness which He bestows on His saints, and the diversity of punishments is as great as the diversity of sins; but the mode thereof is accounted too deep by divine wisdom for human guessing to scrutinize or express. At all events, those to whom Christ came, and to whom He spake, have not, for their great sin of unbelief, any such excuse as may enable them to say, We saw not, we heard not: whether it be that such an excuse would not be sustained by Him whose judgments are unsearchable, or whether it would, and that, if not for their entire deliverance from damnation, at least for its partial alleviation.","title":"Tractate LXXXIX.","author":"Augustine"}]
