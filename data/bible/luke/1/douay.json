{"verses":["Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a\nnarration of the things that have been accomplished among us,","According as they have delivered them unto us, who from the\nbeginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word:","It seemed good to me also, having diligently attained to all\nthings from the beginning, to write to thee in order, most excellent\nTheophilus,","That thou mayest know the verity of those words in which thou hast\nbeen instructed.","There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain\npriest named Zachary, of the course of Abia:  and his wife was of the\ndaughters of Aaron, and her name Elizabeth.","And they were both just before God, walking in all the\ncommandments and justifications of the Lord without blame.","And they had no son, for that Elizabeth was barren:  and they both\nwere well advanced in years.","And it came to pass, when he executed the priestly function in the\norder of his course before God,","According to the custom of the priestly office, it was his lot to\noffer incense, going into the temple of the Lord.","And all the multitude of the people was praying without, at the\nhour of incense.","And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing on the\nright side of the altar of incense.","And Zachary seeing him, was troubled:  and fear fell upon him.","But the angel said to him:  Fear not, Zachary, for thy prayer is\nheard:  and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son.  And thou shalt\ncall his name John.","And thou shalt have joy and gladness:  and many shall rejoice in\nhis nativity.","For he shall be great before the Lord and shall drink no wine nor\nstrong drink:  and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his\nmother's womb.","And he shall convert many of the children of Israel to the Lord\ntheir God.","And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias:  that\nhe may turn the hearts of the fathers unto the children and the\nincredulous to the wisdom of the just, to prepare unto the Lord a\nperfect people.","And Zachary said to the angel:  Whereby shall I know this?  For I\nam an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.","And the angel answering, said to him:  I am Gabriel, who stand\nbefore God and am sent to speak to thee and to bring thee these good\ntidings.","And behold, thou shalt be dumb and shalt not be able to speak\nuntil the day wherein these things shall come to pass:  because thou\nhast not believed my words, which shall be fulfilled in their time.","And the people were waiting for Zachary:  and they wondered that\nhe tarried so long in the temple.","And when he came out, he could not speak to them:  and they\nunderstood that he had seen a vision in the temple.  And he made signs\nto them and remained dumb.","And it came to pass, after the days of his office were\naccomplished, he departed to his own house.","And after those days, Elizabeth his wife conceived and hid\nherself five months, saying:","Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he hath had\nregard to take away my reproach among men.","And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God into\na city of Galilee, called Nazareth,","To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house\nof David:  and the virgin's name was Mary.","And the angel being come in, said unto her:  Hail, full of grace,\nthe Lord is with thee:  blessed art thou among women.","Who having heard, was troubled at his saying and thought with\nherself what manner of salutation this should be.","And the angel said to her:  Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found\ngrace with God.","Behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and shalt bring forth a\nson:  and thou shalt call his name Jesus.","He shall be great and shall be called the Son of the Most High.\nAnd the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of David his father:\nand he shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever.","And of his kingdom there shall be no end.","And Mary said to the angel:  How shall this be done, because I\nknow not man?","And the angel answering, said to her:  The Holy Ghost shall come\nupon thee and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee.  And\ntherefore also the Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the\nSon of God.","And behold thy cousin Elizabeth, she also hath conceived a son in\nher old age:  and this is the sixth month with her that is called\nbarren.","Because no word shall be impossible with God.","And Mary said:  Behold the handmaid of the Lord:  be it done to me\naccording to thy word.  And the angel departed from her.","And Mary rising up in those days, went into the hill country with\nhaste into a city of Juda.","And she entered into the house of Zachary and saluted Elizabeth.","And it came to pass that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of\nMary, the infant leaped in her womb.  And Elizabeth was filled with the\nHoly Ghost.","And she cried out with a loud voice and said:  Blessed art thou\namong women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.","And whence is this to me that the mother of my Lord should come\nto me?","For behold as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my\nears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy.","And blessed art thou that hast believed, because those things\nshall be accomplished that were spoken to thee by the Lord.","And Mary said:  My soul doth magnify the Lord.","And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.","Because he hath regarded the humility of his handmaid:  for behold\nfrom henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.","Because he that is mighty hath done great things to me:  and holy\nis his name.","And his mercy is from generation unto generations, to them that\nfear him.","He hath shewed might in his arm:  he hath scattered the proud in\nthe conceit of their heart.","He hath put down the mighty from their seat and hath exalted the\nhumble.","He hath filled the hungry with good things:  and the rich he hath\nsent empty away.","He hath received Israel his servant, being mindful of his mercy.","As he spoke to our fathers:  to Abraham and to his seed for ever.","And Mary abode with her about three months.  And she returned to\nher own house.","Now Elizabeth's full time of being delivered was come:  and she\nbrought forth a son.","And her neighbors and kinsfolks heard that the Lord had shewed\nhis great mercy towards her:  and they congratulated with her.","And it came to pass that on the eighth day they came to\ncircumcise the child:  and they called him by his father's name Zachary.","And his mother answering, said:  Not so.  But he shall be called\nJohn.","And they said to her:  There is none of thy kindred that is called\nby this name.","And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.","And demanding a writing table, he wrote, saying:  John is his\nname.  And they all wondered.","And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed:  and\nhe spoke, blessing God.","And fear came upon all their neighbours:  and all these things\nwere noised abroad over all the hill country of Judea.","And all they that had heard them laid them up in their heart,\nsaying:  What an one, think ye, shall this child be?  For the hand of the\nLord was with him.","And Zachary his father was filled with the Holy Ghost.  And he\nprophesied, saying:","Blessed be the Lord God of Israel:  because he hath visited and\nwrought the redemption of his people.","And hath raised up an horn of salvation to us, in the house of\nDavid his servant.","As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, who are from the\nbeginning.","Salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us.","To perform mercy to our fathers and to remember his holy\ntestament.","The oath, which he swore to Abraham our father, that he would\ngrant to us.","That being delivered from the hand of our enemies, we may serve\nhim without fear:","In holiness and justice before him, all our days.","And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest:  for\nthou shalt, go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways:","To give knowledge of salvation to his people, unto the remission\nof their sins.","Through the bowels of the mercy of our God, in which the Orient\nfrom on high hath visited us:","To enlighten them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of\ndeath:  to direct our feet into the way of peace.","And the child grew and was strengthened in spirit:  and was in the\ndeserts until the day of his manifestation to Israel."]}
