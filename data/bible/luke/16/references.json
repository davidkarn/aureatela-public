Now the writing was to this effect: \"Your seed, O Hermas, has sinned against God, and they have blasphemed against[fn-2-P269_36731:4-nf] the Lord, and in their great wickedness they have betrayed their parents. And they passed as traitors of their parents, and by their treachery did they not[fn-2-P270_36920:5-nf] reap profit. And even now they have added to their sins lusts and iniquitous pollutions, and thus their iniquities have, been filled up. But make known[fn-2-P271_37096:6-nf] these words to all your children, and to your wife, who is to be your sister. For she does not[fn-2-P272_37283:7-nf] restrain her tongue, with which she commits iniquity; but, on hearing these words, she will control herself, and will obtain mercy. For after you have made known to them these words which my Lord has commanded me to reveal to you,[fn-2-P273_37568:8-nf] then shall they be forgiven all the sins which in former times they committed, and forgiveness will be granted to all the saints who have sinned even to the present day, if they repent with all their heart, and drive all doubts from their minds.[fn-2-P274_37956:9-nf] For the Lord has sworn by His glory, in regard to His elect, that if any one of them sin after a certain day which has been fixed, he shall not be saved. For the repentance of the righteous has limits.[fn-2-P275_38209:10-nf] Filled up are the days of repentance to all the saints; but to the heathen, repentance will be possible even to the last day. You will tell, therefore, those who preside over the Church, to direct their ways in righteousness, that they may receive in full the promises with great glory. Stand stedfast, therefore, ye who work righteousness, and doubt not,[fn-2-P276_38663:11-nf] that your passage[fn-2-P277_38779:12-nf] may be with the holy angels. Happy ye who endure the great tribulation that is coming on, and happy they who shall not deny their own life.[fn-2-P278_38968:13-nf] For the Lord hath sworn by His Son, that those who denied their Lord have abandoned their life in despair, for even now these are to deny Him in the days that are coming.[fn-2-P279_39490:14-nf] To those who denied in earlier times, God became[fn-2-P280_40053:15-nf] gracious, on account of His exceeding tender mercy.\"","title":"Vision Second","author":"The Pastor of Hermas"},{"chapter":16,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_07_on_idolatry_","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"51","folder":"ANF-03","text":"In vain do we flatter ourselves as to the necessities of human maintenance, if-after faith sealed[fn-7-P720_303509:76-nf] -we say, \"I have no means to live? \"[fn-7-P721_303569:77-nf] For here I will now answer more fully that abrupt proposition.

Of spectacles, moreover, and pleasures of that kind, we have already filled a volume of their own.[fn-7-P739_307118:92-nf] In this place must be handled the subject of holidays and other extraordinary solemnities, which we accord sometimes to our wantonness, sometimes to our timidity, in opposition to the common faith and Discipline. The first point, indeed, on which I shall join issue is this: whether a servant of God ought to share with the very nations themselves in matters of his kind either in dress, or in food, or in any other kind of their gladness. \"To rejoice with the rejoicing, and grieve with the grieving,\"[fn-7-P740_307689:93-nf] is said.about brethren by the apostle when exhorting to unanimity. But, for these purposes, \"There is nought of communion between light and darkness,\"[fn-7-P741_307859:94-nf] between life and death or else we rescind what is written, \"The world shall rejoice, but ye shall grieve.\"[fn-7-P742_308118:95-nf] If we rejoice with the world, there is reason to fear that with the world we shall grieve too. But when the world rejoices, let us grieve; and when the world afterward grieves, we shall rejoice. Thus, too, Eleazar[fn-7-P743_308422:96-nf] in Hades,[fn-7-P744_308469:97-nf] (attaining refreshment in Abraham's bosom) and the rich man, (on the other hand, set in the torment of fire) compensate, by an answerable retribution, their alternate vicissitudes of evil and good. There are certain gift-days, which with some adjust the claim of honour, with others the debt of wages. \"Now, then,\" you say, \"I shall receive back what is mine, or pay back what is another's.\" If men have consecrated for themselves this custom from superstition, why do you, estranged as you are from all their vanity, participate in solemnities consecrated to idols; as if for you also there were some prescript about a day, short of the observance of a particular day, to prevent your paying or receiving what you owe a man, or what is owed you by a man? Give me the form after which you wish to be dealt with. For why should you skulk withal, when you contaminate your own conscience by your neighbour's ignorance?

At all events, whether in the latter or the former way, you are guilty of being \"ashamed of God.\"[fn-7-P746_310171:99-nf] But \"whosoever shall be ashamed of Me in the presence of men, of him will I too be ashamed,\" says He, \"in the presence of my Father who is in the heavens.\"[fn-7-P747_310367:100-nf] ","title":"On Idolatry.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":16,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_07_book_ii_","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"41","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Perhaps some (woman) will say: \"To me it is not necessary to be approved by men; for I do not require the testimony of men:[fn-5-P519_107969:128-nf] God is the inspector of the heart.\"[fn-5-P520_108044:129-nf] (That) we all know; provided, however, we remember what the same (God) has said through the apostle: \"Let your probity appear before men.\"[fn-5-P521_108240:130-nf] For what purpose, except that malice may have no access at all to you, or that you may be an example and testimony to the evil?

What brings you, a solitary, into the throng of men? The advice that I give is that of no inexperienced mariner who has never lost either ship or cargo, and has never known a gale. Lately shipwrecked as I have been myself, my warnings to other voyagers spring from my own fears. On one side, like Charybdis, self-indulgence sucks into its vortex the soul's salvation. On the other, like Scylla, lust, with a smile on her girl's face, lures it on to wreck its chastity. The coast is savage, and the devil with a crew of pirates carries irons to fetter his captives. Be not credulous, be not over-confident.The sea may be as smooth and smiling as a pond, its quiet surface may be scarcely ruffled by a breath of air, yet sometimes its waves are as high as mountains. There is danger in its depths, the foe is lurking there. Ease your sheets, spread your sails, fasten the cross as an ensign on your prow. The calm that you speak of is itself a tempest. \"Why so?\" you will perhaps argue; \"are not all my fellow-townsmen Christians?\" Your case, I reply, is not that of others. Listen to the words of the Lord: \"If thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and come and follow me.\"[fn-4-P414_76063:208-nf] You have already promised to be perfect. For when you forsook the army and made yourself an eunuch for the kingdom of heaven's sake,[fn-4-P415_76218:209-nf] you did so that you might follow the perfect life. Now the perfect servant of Christ has nothing beside Christ. Or if he have anything beside Christ he is not perfect. And if he be not perfect when he has promised God to be so, his profession is a lie. But \"the mouth that lieth slayeth the soul.\"[fn-4-P416_76538:210-nf] To conclude, then, if you are perfect you will not set your heart on your father's goods; and if you are not perfect you have deceived the Lord. The Gospel thunders forth its divine warning: \"Ye cannot serve two masters,\"[fn-4-P417_76780:211-nf] and does any one dare to make Christ a liar by serving at once both God and Mammon?

But in those days the world was still unpeopled: accordingly, to pass over instances of childlessness meant only to serve as types, those only were considered happy who could boast of children. It was for this reason that Abraham in his old age married Keturah;[fn-7-P764_152867:486-nf] that Leah hired Jacob with her son's mandrakes,[fn-7-P765_152935:487-nf] and that fair Rachel-a type of the church-complained of the closing of her womb.[fn-7-P766_153040:488-nf] But gradually the crop grew up and then the reaper was sent forth with his sickle. Elijah lived a virgin life, so also did Elisha and many of the sons of the prophets.

The apostle gives the same counsel in different words. \"I think, therefore, that this is good by reason of the present distress, namely that it is good for a man to be as he is.\"[fn-7-P769_153640:491-nf] What is this distress which does away with the joys of wedlock? The apostle tells us, in a later verse: \"The time is short: it remaineth that those who have wives be as though they had none.\"[fn-7-P770_153860:492-nf] Nebuchadnezzar is hard at hand. The lion is bestirring himself from his lair. What good will marriage be to me if it is to end in slavery to the haughtiest of kings? What good will little ones be to me if their lot is to be that which the prophet sadly describes: \"The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst; the young children ask for bread and no man breaketh it unto them\"?[fn-7-P771_154294:493-nf] In those days, as I have said, the virtue of continence was found only in men: Eve still continued to travail with children. But now that a virgin has conceived[fn-7-P772_154474:494-nf] in the womb and has borne to us a child of which the prophet says that \"Government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called the mighty God, the everlasting Father,\"[fn-7-P773_154676:495-nf] now the chain of the curse is broken. Death came through Eve, but life has come through Mary. And thus the gift of virginity has been bestowed most richly upon women, seeing that it has had its beginning from a woman. As soon as the Son of God set foot upon the earth, He formed for Himself a new household there; that, as He was adored by angels in heaven, angels might serve Him also on earth. Then chaste Judith once more cut off the head of Holofernes.[fn-7-P774_155152:496-nf] Then Haman-whose name means iniquity-was once more burned in fire of his own kindling.[fn-7-P775_155260:497-nf] Then James and John forsook father and net and ship and followed the Saviour: neither kinship nor the world's ties, nor the care of their home could hold them back.

In the same strain, the apostle writes: \"He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord: but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world how he may please his wife.

The answer to your reasoning issimple. Jacob, it is true, mourned for Joseph, whom he fancied slain, and thought tomeet only in the grave (his words were: \"I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning\"), but he only did so because Christ had not yet broken open the door of paradise, nor quenched with his blood the flaming sword and the whirling of the guardian cherubim.[fn-12-P1234_264466:830-nf] (Hence in the story of Dives and Lazarus, Abraham and the beggar, though really in a place of refreshment, are described as being in hell.[fn-12-P1235_264876:831-nf] ) And David, who, after interceding in vain for the life of his infant child, refused to weep for it, knowing that it had not sinned, did well to weep for a son who had been a parricide-in will, if not in deed.[fn-12-P1236_265121:832-nf] And when we read that, for Moses and Aaron, lamentation was made after ancient custom, this ought not to surprise us, for even in the Acts of the Apostles, in the full blaze of the gospel, we see that the brethren at Jerusalem made great lamentation for Stephen.[fn-12-P1237_265409:833-nf] This great lamentation, however, refers not to the mourners, but to the funeral procession and to the crowds which accompanied it. This is what the Scripture says of Jacob: \"Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, and all the house of Joseph and his brethren\"; and a few lines farther on: \"And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a great company.\" Finally, \"they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation.\"[fn-12-P1238_265980:834-nf] This solemn lamentation does not impose prolonged weeping upon the Egyptians, but simply describes the funeral ceremony.

Therefore, as I was going to say, the virgin Christ and the virgin Mary have dedicated in themselves the first fruits of virginity for both sexes.[fn-17-P1717_405977:1199-nf] The apostles have either been virgins or, though married, have lived celibate lives. Those persons who are chosen to be bishops, priests, and deacons are either virgins or widowers; or at least when once they have received the priesthood, are vowed to perpetual chastity. Why do we delude ourselves and feel vexed if while we are continually straining after sexual indulgence, we find the palm of chastity denied to us? We wish to fare sumptuously, and to enjoy the embraces of our wives, yet at the same time we desire to reign with Christ among virgins and widows. Shall there be but one reward, then, for hunger and for excess, for filth and for finery, for sackcloth and for silk? Lazarus,[fn-17-P1718_406698:1200-nf] in his lifetime, received evil things, and the rich man, clothed in purple, fat and sleek, while he lived enjoyed the good things of the flesh but, now that they are dead, they occupy different positions.

We know on the other hand that holy men are afflicted with sicknesses, miseries, and want, and perhaps they are tempted to say \"Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.\" Yet immediately they go on to reprove themselves, \"If I say, I will speak thus; behold I should offend against the generation of thy children.\"[fn-28-P2814_738995:1998-nf] If you suppose that your blindness is caused by sin, and that a disease which physicians are often able to cure is an evidence of God's anger, you will think Isaac a sinner because he was so wholly sightless that he was deceived into blessing one whom he did not mean to bless.[fn-28-P2815_739314:1999-nf] You will charge Jacob with sin, whose vision became so dim that he could not see Ephraim and Manasseh,[fn-28-P2816_739438:2000-nf] although with the inner eye and the prophetic spirit he could foresee the distant future and the Christ that was to come of his royal line.[fn-28-P2817_739604:2001-nf] Were any of the kings holier than Josiah? Yet he was slain by the sword of the Egyptians.[fn-28-P2818_739718:2002-nf] Were there ever loftier saints than Peter and Paul? Yet their blood stained the blade of Nero. And to say no more of men, did not the Son of God endure the shame of the cross? And yet you fancy those blessed who enjoy in this world happiness and pleasure? God's hottest anger against sinners is when he shews no anger. Wherefore in Ezekiel he says to Jerusalem: \"My jealousy will depart from thee and i will be quiet and will be no more angry.\"[fn-28-P2819_740188:2003-nf] For \"whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth.\"[fn-28-P2820_740379:2004-nf] The father does not instruct his son unless he loves him. The master does not correct his disciple unless he sees in him signs of promise. When once the doctor gives over caring for the patient, it is a sign that he despairs. You should answer thus: \"as Lazarus in his lifetime[fn-28-P2821_740679:2005-nf] received evil things so will I now gladly suffer torments that future glory may be laid up for me.\" For \"affliction shall not rise up the second time.\"[fn-28-P2822_740854:2006-nf] If Job, a man holy and spotless and righteous in his generation, suffered terrible afflictions, his own book explains the reason why.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":16,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"855","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"4.

Having found myself aground in the shallows of Fabiola's sin, I have dwelt thus long upon her penitence in order that I might open up a larger and quite unimpeded space for the description of her praises.

In the day of prosperity she was not forgetful of affliction;[fn-32-P3242_848678:2354-nf] and, having once suffered shipwreck she was unwilling again to face the risks of the sea. Instead therefore of re-embarking on her old life, she broke up[fn-32-P3243_848857:2355-nf] and sold all that she could lay hands on of her property (it was large and suitable to her rank), and turning it into money she laid out this for the benefit of the poor. She was the first person to found a hospital, into which she might gather sufferers out of the streets, and where she might nurse the unfortunate victims of sickness and want. Need I now recount the various ailments of human beings? Need I speak of noses slit, eyes put out, feet half burnt, hands covered with sores? Or of limbs dropsical and atrophied? Or of diseased flesh alive with worms? Often did she carry on her own shoulders persons infected with jaundice or with filth. Often too did she wash away the matter discharged from wounds which others, even though men, could not bear to look at. She gave food to her patients with her own hand, and moistened the scarce breathing lips of the dying with sips of liquid. I know of many wealthy and devout persons who, unable to overcome their natural repugnance to such sights, perform this work of mercy by the agency of others, giving money instead of personal aid. I do not blame them and am far from construing their weakness of resolution into a want of faith. While however I pardon such squeamishness, I extol to the skies the enthusiastic zeal of a mind that is above it. A great faith makes little of such trifles. But I know how terrible was the retribution which fell upon the proud mind of the rich man clothed in purple for not having helped Lazarus.[fn-32-P3244_850397:2356-nf] The poor wretch whom we despise, whom we cannot so much as look at, and the very sight of whom turns our stomachs, is human like ourselves, is made of the same clay as we are, is formed out of the same elements.

The apostle commands these latter to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents and to relieve them adequately; that the church may not be charged, but may be free to relieve those that are widows indeed. \"Honour widows,\" he writes, \"that are widows indeed,\" that is, such as are desolate and have no relations to help them, who cannot labour with their hands, who are weakened by poverty and overcome by years, whose trust is in God and their only work prayer.[fn-45-P4549_1235993:3237-nf] From which it is easy to infer that the younger widows, unless they are excused by ill health, are either left to their own exertions or else are consigned to the care of their children or relations. The word `honour' in this passage implies either alms or a gift, as also in the verse immediately following: \"Let the elders ...be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.\"[fn-45-P4550_1236447:3238-nf] So also in the gospel when the Lord discusses that commandment of the Law which says: \"Honour thy father and thy mother,\"[fn-45-P4551_1236592:3239-nf] He declares that it is to be interpreted not of mere words which while offering an empty shew of regard may still leave a parent's wants unrelieved, but of the actual provision of the necessaries of life. The Lord commanded that poor parents should be supported by their children and that these should pay them back when old those benefits which they had themselves received in their childhood. The scribes and pharisees on the other hand taught the children to answer their parents by saying: \"It is Corban, that is to say, a gift[fn-45-P4552_1237146:3240-nf] which I have promised to the altar and engaged to present to the temple: it will relieve you as much there, as if I were to give it you directly to buy food.\"[fn-45-P4553_1237328:3241-nf] So it frequently happened that while father and mother were destitute their children were offering sacrifices for the priests and scribes to consume. If then the apostle compels poor widows-yet only those who are young and not broken down by sickness-to labour with their hands that the church, not charged with their maintenance, may be able to support such widows as are old, what plea can be urged by one who has abundance of this world's goods, both for her own wants and those of others, and who can make to herself friends of the mammon of unrighteousness able to receive her into everlasting habitations?[fn-45-P4554_1238016:3242-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":16,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1377","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"10.

Let us then turn to Him, my beloved friend, and execute the will of God. For He created us and brought us into being, that He might make us partakers of eternal blessings, that He might offer us the kingdom of Heaven, not that He might cast us into Hell and deliver us to the fire; for this was made not for us, but for the devil: but for us the kingdom has been destined and made ready of old time. And by way of indicating both these truths He saith to those on the right hand, \"Come ye blessed of my Father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:\" but to those on the left \"Depart from me, ye cursed, into fire everlasting prepared\" (he no longer says \"for you\" but) \"for the devil and his angels.\"[fn-6-P641_360238:28-nf] Thus hell has not been made for us but for him and his angels: but the kingdom has been prepared for us before the foundation of the world. Let us not then make ourselves unworthy of entrance into the bride-chamber: for as long as we are in this world, even if we commit countless sins it is possible to wash them all away by manifesting repentance for our offences: but when once we have departed to the other world even if we display the most earnest repentance it will be of no avail, not even if we gnash our teeth, beat our breasts, and utter innumerable calls for succour, no one with the tip of his finger will apply a drop to our burning bodies, but we shall only hear those words which the rich man heard in the parable \"Between us and you a great gulf has been fixed.\"[fn-6-P642_361039:29-nf] Let us then, I beseech you, recover our senses here and let us recognize our Master as He ought to be recognized. For only when we are in Hades should we abandon the hope derived from repentance: for there only is this remedy weak and unprofitable: but while we are here even if it is applied in old age itself it exhibits much strength. Wherefore also the devil sets everything in motion in order to root in us the reasoning which comes of despair: for he knows that if we repent even a little we shall not do this without some reward. But just as he who gives a cup of cold water has his recompense reserved for him, so also the man who has repented of the evils which he has done, even if he cannot exhibit the repentance which his offences deserve, will have a commensurate reward. For not a single item of good, however small it may be, will be overlooked by the righteous judge. For if He makes such an exact scrutiny of our sins, as to require punishment for both our words and thoughts, much more will our good deeds, whether they be great or small, be reckoned to our credit at that day. Wherefore, even if thyself in a slight degree at least from thy present disorder and excess, even this will not be impossible: only set thyself to the task at once, and open the entrance into the place of contest; but as long as thou tarriest outside this naturally seems difficult and impracticable to thee. For before making the trial even if things are easy and manageable they are wont to present an appearance of much difficulty to us: but when we are actually engaged in the trial, and making the venture the greater part of our distress is removed, and confidence taking the place of tremor and despair lessens the fear and increases the facility of operation, and makes our good hopes stronger. For this reason also the wicked one dragged Judas out of this world lest he should make a fair beginning, and so return by means of repentance to the point from which he fell. For although it may seem a strange thing to say, I will not admit even that sin to be too great for the succour which is brought to us from repentance. Wherefore I pray and beseech you to banish all this Satanic mode of thinking from your soul, and to return to this state of salvation. For if indeed I were commanding you to ascend to your former altitude all at once, you would naturally complain of there being much difficulty in doing this: but if all which I now ask you to do is to get up and return thence in the opposite directio, why do you hesitate, and shrink, and make a retrograde movement? Have you not seen those who have died in the midst of luxury and drunkenness, and sport and all the other folly of this life? Were are they now who used to strut through the market place with much pomp, and a crowd of attendants? who were clothed in silk and redolent with perfumes, and kept a table for their parasites, and were in constant attendance at the theatre? What has now become of all that parade of theirs? It is all gone;-the costly splendour of their banquets , the throng of musicians, the attentions of flatterers, the loud laughter, the relaxation of spirit, the enervation of mind, the voluptuous, abandoned, extravagant manner of life-it has all come to an end. Where now have all these things taken their flight? What has become of the body which enjoyed so much attention, and cleanliness. Go thy way to the coffin, behold the dust, the ashes, the worms, behold the loathsomeness of the place, and groan bitterly. And would that the penalty were limited to the ashes! but now transfer thy thought from the coffin and these worms to that undying worm, to the fire unquenchable, to the gnashing of teeth, to the outer darkness, to affliction and straitness, to the parable of Lazarus and the rich man, who although the owner of so much wealth, and clothed in purple could not become the owner of even a drop of water; and this when he was placed in a condition of such great necessity. The things of this world are in their nature no-wise better than dreams. For just as those who work in the mines or suffer some other kind of punishment more severe than this, when they have fallen asleep owing to their many weary toils and the extreme bitterness of their life, and in their dreams see themselves living in luxury and prosperity, are in no wise grateful to their dreams after they have awaked, even so that rich man having become rich in this present life, as it were in a dream, after his departure hence was punished with that bitter punishment. Consider these things, and having contrasted that fire with the conflagration of desires which now possesses thee, release thyself from the furnace. For he who has thoroughly quenched this furnace here, will have no experience of that in the other world: but if a man does not get the better of this furnace here, the other will lay hold of him more vehemently when he has departed hence. How long a time dost thou wish the enjoyment of the present life to be extended? For I do not suppose indeed that more than fifty years remain to thee so as to reach extreme old age, nor indeed is even this at all assured to us: for how should they who cannot be confident about living even to the evening rely upon so many years as these? And not only is this uncertain, but there is for often when life has been extended for a long period, the conditions of luxury have not been extended with it, but have come, and at the same time hastily departed. However, if you like, let it be granted for argument's sake, tthat you will live so many years, and will not sustain any reverse of fortune what is this compared with the endless ages, and those bitter deed and intolerable punishments? For here indeed both good and evil things have an end, and that very speedily: but there, both are coextensive with immortal ages, and in their quality differ unspeakably from the things which now are.","title":"Letter I.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":16,"verse":29,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_10_book_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"37","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"22. But it is now time for us to raise the standard of Joshua's chastity. It is written that Moses had a wife. Now Moses is interpreted both by our Lord and by the Apostle to mean the law:[fn-62-P6279_1921028:124-nf] \"They have Moses and the prophets.\" And[fn-62-P6280_1921092:125-nf] \"Death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adam's transgression.\" And no one doubts that in both passages Moses signifies the law. We read that Moses, that is the law, had a wife: shew me then in the same way that Joshua the son of Nun had either wife or children, and if you can do so, I will confess that I am beaten. He certainly received the fairest spot in the division of the land of Judah, and died, not in the twenties, which are ever unlucky in Scripture-by them are reckoned the years of[fn-62-P6281_1921661:126-nf] Jacob's service,[fn-62-P6282_1921700:127-nf] the price of Joseph, and[fn-62-P6283_1921749:128-nf] sundry presents which Esau who was fond of them received-but in the[fn-62-P6284_1921840:129-nf] tens, whose praises we have often sung; and he was buried in[fn-62-P6285_1921961:130-nf] Thamnath Sare, that is, most perfect sovereignty, or among those of a new covering, to signify the crowds of virgins, covered by the Saviour's aid on Mount Ephraim, that is, the fruitful mountain; on the north of the Mountain of Gaash, which is, being interpreted, disturbance: for[fn-62-P6286_1922757:131-nf] \"Mount Sion is on the sides of the north, the city of the Great King,\" is ever exposed to hatred, and in every trial says[fn-62-P6287_1922955:132-nf] \"But my feet had well nigh slipped.\" The book which bears the name of Joshua ends with his burial. Again in the book of Judges we read of him as though he had risen and come to life again, and by way of summary his works are extolled. We read too[fn-62-P6288_1923224:133-nf] \"So Joshua sent the people away, every man unto his inheritance, that they might possess the land.\" And \"Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua,\" and so on. There immediately follows: \"And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being an hundred and ten years old.\" Moses, moreover, only saw the land of promise; he could not enter: and[fn-62-P6289_1923605:134-nf] \"he died in the land of Moab, and the Lord buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.\" Let us compare the burial of the two: Moses died in the land of Moab, Joshua in the land of Judaea. The former was buried in a valley over against the house of Phogor, which is, being interpreted, reproach (for the Hebrew Phogor corresponds to Priapus[fn-62-P6290_1924044:135-nf] ); the latter in Mount Ephraim on the north of Mount Gaash. And in the simple expressions of the sacred Scriptures there is always a more subtle meaning. The Jews gloried in children and child-bearing; and the barren woman, who had not offspring in Israel, was accursed; but blessed was he whose seed was in Sion, and his family in Jerusalem; and part of the highest blessing was,[fn-62-P6291_1924564:136-nf] \"Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine, in the innermost parts of thy house, thy children like olive plants, round about thy table.\" Therefore his grave is described as placed in a valley over against the house of an idol which was in a special sense consecrated to lust. But we who fight under Joshua our leader, even to the present day know not where Moses was buried. For we despise Phogor, and all his shame, knowing that they who are in the flesh cannot please God. And the Lord before the flood had said[fn-62-P6292_1925097:137-nf] \"My spirit shall not abide in man for ever, for that he also is flesh.\" Wherefore, when Moses died, the people of Israel mourned for him; but Joshua like one on his way to victory was unmourned.

As for our own teachers, indeed, our reference to them is ex abundanti-a surplusage of authority: in the Gospel itself they will be found to have the clearest evidence for the corporeal nature of the soul. In hell the soul of a certain man is in torment, punished in flames, suffering excruciating thirst, and imploring from the finger of a happier soul, for his tongue, the solace of a drop of water.[fn-26-P2632_871215:46-nf] Do you suppose that this end of the blessed poor man and the miserable rich man is only imaginary? Then why the name of Lazarus in this narrative, if the circumstance is not in (the category of) a real occurrence? But even if it is to be regarded as imaginary, it will still be a testimony to truth and reality. For unless the soul possessed corporeality, the image of a soul could not possibly contain a finger of a bodily substance; nor would the Scripture feign a statement about the limbs of a body, if these had no existence. But what is that which is removed to Hades[fn-26-P2633_871812:47-nf] after the separation of the body; which is there detained; which is reserved until the day of judgment; to which Christ also, on dying, descended? I imagine it is the souls of the patriarchs. But wherefore (all this), if the soul is nothing in its subterranean abode? For nothing it certainly is, if it is not a bodily substance. For whatever is incorporeal is incapable of being kept and guarded in any way; it is also exempt from either punishment or refreshment. That must be a body, by which punishment and refreshment can be experienced. Of this I shall treat more fully in a more fitting place. Therefore, whatever amount of punishment or refreshment the soul tastes in Hades, in its prison or lodging,[fn-26-P2634_872558:48-nf] in the fire or in Abraham's bosom, it gives proof thereby of its own corporeality. For an incorporeal thing suffers nothing, not having that which makes it capable of suffering; else, if it has such capacity, it must be a bodily substance. For in as far as every corporeal thing is capable of suffering, in so far is that which is capable of suffering also corporeal.[fn-26-P2635_872943:49-nf] ","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":16,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_22_a_treatise_on_the_soul_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"82","folder":"ANF-03","text":"When we aver that the soul has a body of a quality and kind peculiar to itself, in this special condition of it we shall be already supplied with a decision respecting all the other accidents of its corporeity; how that they belong to it, because we have shown it to be a body, but that even they have a quality peculiar to themselves, proportioned to the special nature of the body (to which they belong); or else, if any accidents (of a body) are remarkable in this instance for their absence, then this, too, results from the peculiarity of the condition of the soul's corporeity, from which are absent sundry qualities which are present to all other corporeal beings. And yet, notwithstanding all this, we shall not be at all inconsistent if we declare that the more usual characteristics of a body, such as invariably accrue to the corporeal condition, belong also to the soul-such as form[fn-26-P2644_877320:52-nf] and limitation; and that triad of dimensions[fn-26-P2645_877379:53-nf] -I mean length, and breadth and height-by which philosophers gauge al bodies. What now remains but for us to give the soul a figure?[fn-26-P2646_877582:54-nf] Plato refuses to do this, as if it endangered the soul's immortality.[fn-26-P2647_877667:55-nf] For everything which has figure is, according to him, compound, and composed of parts;[fn-26-P2648_877789:56-nf] whereas the soul is immortal; and being immortal, it is therefore indissoluble; and being indissoluble, it is figureless: for if, on the contrary, it had figure, it would be of a composite and structural formation. He, however, in some other manner frames for the soul an effigy of intellectual forms, beautiful for its just symmetry and tuitions of philosophy, but misshapen by some contrary qualities. As for ourselves, indeed, we inscribe on the soul the lineaments of corporeity, not simply from the assurance which reasoning has taught us of its corporeal nature, but also from the firm conviction which divine grace impresses on us by revelation. For, seeing that we acknowledge spiritual charismata, or gifts, we too have merited the attainment of the prophetic gift, although coming after John (the Baptist). We have now amongst us a sister whose lot it has been to be favoured with sundry gifts of revelation, which she experiences in the Spirit by ecstatic vision amidst the sacred rites of the Lord's day in the church: she converses with angels, and sometimes even with the Lord; she both sees and hears mysterious communications;[fn-26-P2649_878948:57-nf] some men's hearts she understands, and to them who are in need she distributes remedies. Whether it be in the reading of Scriptures, or in the chanting of psalms, or in the preaching of sermons, or in the offering up of prayers, in all these religious services matter and opportunity are afforded to her of seeing visions. It may possibly have happened to us, whilst this sister of ours was rapt in the Spirit, that we had discoursed in some ineffable way about the soul. After the people are dismissed at the conclusion of the sacred services, she is in the regular habit of reporting to us whatever things she may have seen in vision (for all her communications are examined with the most scrupulous care, in order that their truth may be probed). \"Amongst other things,\" says she, \"there has been shown to me a soul in bodily shape, and a spirit has been in the habit of appearing to me; not, however, a void and empty illusion, but such as would offer itself to be even grasped by the hand, soft and transparent and of an etherial colour, and in form resembling that of a human being in every respect.\" This was her vision, and for her witness there was God; and the apostle most assuredly foretold that there were to be \"spiritual gifts\" in the church.[fn-26-P2650_880223:58-nf] Now, can you refuse to believe this, even if indubitable evidence on every point is forthcoming for your conviction? Since, then, the soul is a corporeal substance, no doubt it possesses qualities such as those which we have just mentioned, amongst them the property of colour, which is inherent in every bodily substance. Now what colour would you attribute to the soul but an etherial transparent one? Not that its substance is actually the ether or air (although this was the opinion of ¦nesidemus and Anaximenes, and I suppose of Heraclitus also, as some say of him), nor transparent light (although Heraclides of Pontus held it to be so). \"Thunder-stones,\"[fn-26-P2651_880931:59-nf] indeed, are not of igneous substance, because they shine with ruddy redness; nor are beryls composed of aqueous matter, because they are of a pure wavy whiteness. How many things also besides these are there which their colour would associate in the same class, but which nature keeps widely apart! Since, however, everything which is very attenuated and transparent bears a strong resemblance to the air, such would be the case with the soul, since in its material nature[fn-26-P2652_881428:60-nf] it is wind and breath, (or spirit); whence it is that the belief of its corporeal quality is endangered, in consequence of the extreme tenuity and subtilty of its essence. Likewise, as regards the figure of the human soul from your own conception, you can well imagine that it is none other than the human form; indeed, none other than the shape of that body which each individual soul animates and moves about. This we may at once be induced to admit from contemplating man's original formation. For only carefully consider, after God hath breathed upon the face of man the breath of life, and man had consequently become a living soul, surely that breath must have passed through the face at once into the interior structure, and have spread itself throughout all the spaces of the body; and as soon as by the divine inspiration it had become condensed, it must have impressed itself on each internal feature, which the condensation had filled in, and so have been, as it were, congealed in shape, (or stereotyped). Hence, by this densifying process, there arose a fixing of the soul's corporeity; and by the impression its figure was formed and moulded. This is the inner man, different from the outer, but yet one in the twofold condition.[fn-26-P2653_882685:61-nf] It, too, has eyes and ears of its own, by means of which Paul must have heard and seen the Lord;[fn-26-P2654_882804:62-nf] it has, moreover all the other members of the body by the help of which it effects all processes of thinking and all activity in dreams. Thus it happens that the rich man in hell has a tongue and poor (Lazarus) a finger and Abraham a bosom.[fn-26-P2655_883067:63-nf] By these features also the souls of the martyrs under the altar are distinguished and known. The soul indeed which in the beginning was associated with Adam's body, which grew with its growth and was moulded after its form proved to be the germ both of the entire substance (of the human soul) and of that (part of) creation","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":16,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_23_ix_de_fuga_in_persecutione_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"16","folder":"ANF-04","text":"13.

One who threatens if he does not receive, does not crave, but compels. It is not alms he looks for, who comes not to be pitied, but to be feared. I will give, therefore, because I pity, not because I fear, when the recipient honours God and returns me his blessing; not when rather he both believes that he has conferred a favour on me, and, beholding his plunder, says, \"Guilt money.\" Shall I be angry even with an enemy? But enmities have also other grounds. Yet withal he did not say a, betrayer, or persecutor, or one seeking to terrify you by his threats. For how much more shall I heap coals upon the head of a man of this sort, if I do not redeem myself by money? \"In like manner,\" says Jesus, \"to him who has taken away your coat, grant even your cloak also.\" But that refers to him who has sought to take away my property, not my faith. The cloak, too, I will grant, if I am not threatened with betrayal. If he threatens, I will demand even my coat back again. Even now, the declarations of the Lord have reasons and laws of their own. They are not of unlimited or universal application. And so He commands us to give to every one who asks, yet He Himself does not give to those who ask a sign. Otherwise, if you think that we should give indiscriminately to all who ask, that seems to me to mean that you would give, I say not wine to him who has a fever, but even poison or a sword to him who longs for death. But how we are to understand,\" Make to yourselves friends of mammon,\"[fn-20-P2001_612946:57-nf] let the previous parable teach you. The saying was addressed to the Jewish people; inasmuch as, having managed ill the business of the Lord which had been entrusted to them, they ought to have provided for themselves out of the men of mammon, which we then were, friends rather than enemies, and to have delivered us from the dues of sins which kept us from God, if they bestowed the blessing upon us, for the reason given by the Lord, that when grace began to depart from them, they, betaking themselves to our faith, might be admitted into everlasting habitations. Hold now any other explanation of this parable and saying you like, if only you clearly see that there is no likelihood of our opposers, should we make them friends with mammon, then receiving us into everlasting abodes. But of what will not cowardice convince men? As if Scripture both allowed them to flee, and commanded them to buy off! Finally, it is not enough if one or another is so rescued. Whole Churches have imposed tribute en masse on themselves. I know not whether it is matter for grief or shame when among hucksters, and pickpockets, and bath-thieves, and gamesters, and pimps, Christians too are included as taxpayers in the lists of free soldiers and spies. Did the apostles, with so much foresight, make the office of overseer of this type, that the occupants might be able to enjoy their rule free from anxiety, under colour of providing (a like freedom for their flocks)?

And this capacity, which we now see in the spirit of all, shall be hereafter in the bodies of the damned. Moreover, if we attend to the matter a little more closely, we see that what is called bodily pain is rather to be referred to the soul. For it is the soul not the body, which is pained, even when the pain originates with the body,-the soul feeling pain at the point where the body is hurt. As then we speak of bodies feeling and living, though the feeling and life of the body are from the soul, so also we speak of bodies being pained, though no pain can be suffered by the body apart from the soul. The soul, then, is pained with the body in that part where something occurs to hurt it; and it is pained alone, though it be in the body, when some invisible cause distresses it, while the body is safe and sound. Even when not associated with the body it is pained; for certainly that rich man was suffering in hell when he Cried, \"I am tormented in this flame.\"[fn-40-P4092_2237196:4-nf] But as for the body, it suffers no pain when it is soulless; and even when animate it can suffer only by the soul's suffering. If, therefore, we might draw a just presumption from the existence of pain to that of death, and conclude that where pain can be felt death can occur, death would rather be the property of the soul, for to it pain more peculiarly belongs. But, seeing that that which suffers most cannot die, what ground is there for supposing that those bodies, because destined to suffer, are therefore, destined to die?

Thus, therefore, both that flame in which he burned and that drop he begged were immaterial, and resembled the visions of sleepers or persons in an ecstasy, to whom immaterial objects appear in a bodily form.

For even the very words of so great a Master and Lord are to be intently considered. For He does not say, If ye forgive men their sins, your Father will also forgive you your sins, no matter of what sort they be, but He says, your sins; for it was a daily prayer He was teaching, and it was certainly to disciples already justified He was speaking.

Nevertheless not even great sins themselves-sins from which we must flee with a total reformation of life-are forgiven to those who pray, unless they observe the appended precept, \"as ye also forgive your debtors.\" For if the very small sins which attach even to the life of the righteous be not remitted without that condition, how much further from obtaining indulgence shall those be who are involved in many great crimes, if, while they cease from perpetrating such enormities, they still inexorably refuse to remit any debt incurred to themselves, since the Lord says, \"But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses?\"[fn-43-P4313_2357945:102-nf] For this is the purport of the saying of the Apostle James also, \"He shall have judgment without mercy that hath showed no mercy.\"[fn-43-P4314_2358097:103-nf] For we should remember that servant whose debt of ten thousand talents his lord cancelled, but afterwards ordered him to pay up, because the servant himself had no pity for his fellow-servant, who owed him an hundred pence.[fn-43-P4315_2358341:104-nf] The words which the Apostle James subjoins,\"And mercy rejoiceth against judgment,\"[fn-43-P4316_2358448:105-nf] find their application among those who are the children of the promise and vessels of mercy.

Then, if you have no interpreter by you, you may learn again from Himself what He would have understood by mammon.[fn-66-P6627_1941909:1292-nf] For when advising us to provide for ourselves the help of friends in worldly affairs, after the example of that steward who, when removed from his office,[fn-66-P6628_1942602:1293-nf] relieves his lord's debtors by lessening their debts with a view to their recompensing him with their help, He said, \"And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness,\" that is to say, of money, even as the steward had done. Now we are all of us aware that money is the instigator[fn-66-P6629_1942932:1294-nf] of unrighteousness, and the lord of the whole world. Therefore, when he saw the covetousness of the Pharisees doing servile worship[fn-66-P6630_1943083:1295-nf] to it, He hurled[fn-66-P6631_1943120:1296-nf] this sentence against them, \"Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\"[fn-66-P6632_1943203:1297-nf] Then the Pharisees, who were covetous of riches, derided Him, when they understood that by mammon He meant money. Let no one think that under the word mammon the Creator was meant, and that Christ called them off from the service of the Creator. What folly! Rather learn therefrom that one God was pointed out by Christ. For they were two masters whom He named, God and mammon-the Creator and money. You cannot indeed serve God-Him, of course whom they seemed to serve-and mammon to whom they preferred to devote themselves.[fn-66-P6633_1943751:1298-nf] If, however, he was giving himself out as another god, it would not be two masters, but three, that he had pointed out. For the Creator was a master, and much more of a master, to be sure,[fn-66-P6634_1943984:1299-nf] than mammon, and more to be adored, as being more truly our Master. Now, how was it likely that He who had called mammon a master, and had associated him with God, should say nothing of Him who was really the Master of even these, that is, the Creator? Or else, by this silence respecting Him did He concede that service might be rendered to Him, since it was to Himself alone and to mammon that He said service could not be (simultaneously) rendered? When, therefore, He lays down the position that God is one, since He would have been sure to mention[fn-66-P6635_1944554:1300-nf] the Creator if He were Himself a rival[fn-66-P6636_1944615:1301-nf] to Him, He did (virtually) name the Creator, when He refrained from insisting\"[fn-66-P6637_1944710:1302-nf] that He was Master alone, without a rival god. Accordingly, this will throw light upon the sense in which it was said, \"If ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches? \"[fn-66-P6638_1944961:1303-nf] \"In the unrighteous mammon,\" that is to say, in unrighteous riches, not in the Creator; for even Marcion allows Him to be righteous: \"And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who will give to you that which is mine? \"[fn-66-P6639_1945226:1304-nf] For whatever is unrighteous ought to be foreign to the servants of God. But in what way was the Creator foreign to the Pharisees, seeing that He was the proper God of the Jewish nation? Forasmuch then as the words, \"Who will entrust to you the truer riches? \"and, \"Who will give you that which is mine? \"are only suitable to the Creator and not to mammon, He could not have uttered them as alien to the Creator, and in the interest of the rival god. He could only seem to have spoken them in this sense, if, when remarking[fn-66-P6640_1945846:1305-nf] their unfaithfulness to the Creator and not to mammon, He had drawn some distinctions between the Creator (in his manner of mentioning Him) and the rival god-how that the latter would not commit his own truth to those who were unfaithful to the Creator. How then can he possibly seem to belong to another god, if He be not set forth, with the express intention of being separated[fn-66-P6641_1946244:1306-nf] from the very thing which is in question. But when the Pharisees \"justified themselves before men,\"[fn-66-P6642_1946374:1307-nf] and placed their hope of reward in man, He censured them in the sense in which the prophet Jeremiah said, \"Cursed is the man that trust-eth in man.\"[fn-66-P6643_1946546:1308-nf] Since the prophet went on to say, \"But the Lord knoweth your hearts,\"[fn-66-P6644_1946639:1309-nf] he magnified the power of that God who declared Himself to be as a lamp, \"searching the reins and the heart.\"[fn-66-P6645_1946801:1310-nf] When He strikes at pride in the words: \"That which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God,\"[fn-66-P6646_1946940:1311-nf] He recalls Isaiah: \"For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is arrogant and lifted up, and they shall be brought low.\"[fn-66-P6647_1947148:1312-nf] I can now make out why Marcion's god was for so long an age concealed. He was, I suppose, waiting until he had learnt all these things from the Creator.

Then, if you have no interpreter by you, you may learn again from Himself what He would have understood by mammon.[fn-66-P6627_1941909:1292-nf] For when advising us to provide for ourselves the help of friends in worldly affairs, after the example of that steward who, when removed from his office,[fn-66-P6628_1942602:1293-nf] relieves his lord's debtors by lessening their debts with a view to their recompensing him with their help, He said, \"And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness,\" that is to say, of money, even as the steward had done. Now we are all of us aware that money is the instigator[fn-66-P6629_1942932:1294-nf] of unrighteousness, and the lord of the whole world.

Let no one think that under the word mammon the Creator was meant, and that Christ called them off from the service of the Creator. What folly! Rather learn therefrom that one God was pointed out by Christ. For they were two masters whom He named, God and mammon-the Creator and money. You cannot indeed serve God-Him, of course whom they seemed to serve-and mammon to whom they preferred to devote themselves.[fn-66-P6633_1943751:1298-nf] If, however, he was giving himself out as another god, it would not be two masters, but three, that he had pointed out. For the Creator was a master, and much more of a master, to be sure,[fn-66-P6634_1943984:1299-nf] than mammon, and more to be adored, as being more truly our Master. Now, how was it likely that He who had called mammon a master, and had associated him with God, should say nothing of Him who was really the Master of even these, that is, the Creator? Or else, by this silence respecting Him did He concede that service might be rendered to Him, since it was to Himself alone and to mammon that He said service could not be (simultaneously) rendered?

Forasmuch then as the words, \"Who will entrust to you the truer riches? \"and, \"Who will give you that which is mine? \"are only suitable to the Creator and not to mammon, He could not have uttered them as alien to the Creator, and in the interest of the rival god. He could only seem to have spoken them in this sense, if, when remarking[fn-66-P6640_1945846:1305-nf] their unfaithfulness to the Creator and not to mammon, He had drawn some distinctions between the Creator (in his manner of mentioning Him) and the rival god-how that the latter would not commit his own truth to those who were unfaithful to the Creator. How then can he possibly seem to belong to another god, if He be not set forth, with the express intention of being separated[fn-66-P6641_1946244:1306-nf] from the very thing which is in question. But when the Pharisees \"justified themselves before men,\"[fn-66-P6642_1946374:1307-nf] and placed their hope of reward in man, He censured them in the sense in which the prophet Jeremiah said, \"Cursed is the man that trust-eth in man.\"[fn-66-P6643_1946546:1308-nf] Since the prophet went on to say, \"But the Lord knoweth your hearts,\"[fn-66-P6644_1946639:1309-nf] he magnified the power of that God who declared Himself to be as a lamp, \"searching the reins and the heart.\"[fn-66-P6645_1946801:1310-nf] When He strikes at pride in the words: \"That which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God,\"[fn-66-P6646_1946940:1311-nf] He recalls Isaiah: \"For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is arrogant and lifted up, and they shall be brought low.\"[fn-66-P6647_1947148:1312-nf] I can now make out why Marcion's god was for so long an age concealed.

Then, if you have no interpreter by you, you may learn again from Himself what He would have understood by mammon.[fn-66-P6627_1941909:1292-nf] For when advising us to provide for ourselves the help of friends in worldly affairs, after the example of that steward who, when removed from his office,[fn-66-P6628_1942602:1293-nf] relieves his lord's debtors by lessening their debts with a view to their recompensing him with their help, He said, \"And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness,\" that is to say, of money, even as the steward had done. Now we are all of us aware that money is the instigator[fn-66-P6629_1942932:1294-nf] of unrighteousness, and the lord of the whole world.

Let no one think that under the word mammon the Creator was meant, and that Christ called them off from the service of the Creator. What folly! Rather learn therefrom that one God was pointed out by Christ. For they were two masters whom He named, God and mammon-the Creator and money. You cannot indeed serve God-Him, of course whom they seemed to serve-and mammon to whom they preferred to devote themselves.[fn-66-P6633_1943751:1298-nf] If, however, he was giving himself out as another god, it would not be two masters, but three, that he had pointed out. For the Creator was a master, and much more of a master, to be sure,[fn-66-P6634_1943984:1299-nf] than mammon, and more to be adored, as being more truly our Master. Now, how was it likely that He who had called mammon a master, and had associated him with God, should say nothing of Him who was really the Master of even these, that is, the Creator? Or else, by this silence respecting Him did He concede that service might be rendered to Him, since it was to Himself alone and to mammon that He said service could not be (simultaneously) rendered?

Forasmuch then as the words, \"Who will entrust to you the truer riches? \"and, \"Who will give you that which is mine? \"are only suitable to the Creator and not to mammon, He could not have uttered them as alien to the Creator, and in the interest of the rival god. He could only seem to have spoken them in this sense, if, when remarking[fn-66-P6640_1945846:1305-nf] their unfaithfulness to the Creator and not to mammon, He had drawn some distinctions between the Creator (in his manner of mentioning Him) and the rival god-how that the latter would not commit his own truth to those who were unfaithful to the Creator. How then can he possibly seem to belong to another god, if He be not set forth, with the express intention of being separated[fn-66-P6641_1946244:1306-nf] from the very thing which is in question. But when the Pharisees \"justified themselves before men,\"[fn-66-P6642_1946374:1307-nf] and placed their hope of reward in man, He censured them in the sense in which the prophet Jeremiah said, \"Cursed is the man that trust-eth in man.\"[fn-66-P6643_1946546:1308-nf] Since the prophet went on to say, \"But the Lord knoweth your hearts,\"[fn-66-P6644_1946639:1309-nf] he magnified the power of that God who declared Himself to be as a lamp, \"searching the reins and the heart.\"[fn-66-P6645_1946801:1310-nf] When He strikes at pride in the words: \"That which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God,\"[fn-66-P6646_1946940:1311-nf] He recalls Isaiah: \"For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is arrogant and lifted up, and they shall be brought low.\"[fn-66-P6647_1947148:1312-nf] I can now make out why Marcion's god was for so long an age concealed.

So that, if the old course has ceased and the new has begun, with John intervening between them, there will be nothing wonderful in it, because it happens according to the purpose of the Creator; so that you may get a better proof for the kingdom of God from any quarter, however anomalous,[fn-66-P6650_1948709:1315-nf] than from the conceit that the law and the prophets ended in John, and a new state of things began after him. \"More easily, therefore, may heaven and earth pass away-as also the law and the prophets-than that one tittle of the Lord's words should fail.\"[fn-66-P6651_1949010:1316-nf] \"For,\" as says Isaiah: \"the word of our God shall stand for ever.\"[fn-66-P6652_1949112:1317-nf] Since even then by Isaiah it was Christ, the Word and Spirit[fn-66-P6653_1949194:1318-nf] of the Creator, who prophetically described John as \"the voice of one crying in the wilderness to prepare the way of the Lord,\"[fn-66-P6654_1949429:1319-nf] and as about to come for the purpose of terminating thenceforth the course of the law and the prophets; by their fulfilment and not their extinction, and in order that the kingdom of God might be announced by Christ, He therefore purposely added the assurance that the elements would more easily pass away than His words fail; affirming, as He did, the further fact, that what He had said concerning John had not fallen to the ground.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":16,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":35,"source_paragraph":"116","folder":"ANF-03","text":"What the two masters are who, He says, cannot be served,[fn-66-P6624_1941601:1289-nf] on the ground that while one is pleased[fn-66-P6625_1941664:1290-nf] the other must needs be displeased,[fn-66-P6626_1941718:1291-nf] He Himself makes clear, when He mentions God and mammon. Then, if you have no interpreter by you, you may learn again from Himself what He would have understood by mammon.[fn-66-P6627_1941909:1292-nf] For when advising us to provide for ourselves the help of friends in worldly affairs, after the example of that steward who, when removed from his office,[fn-66-P6628_1942602:1293-nf] relieves his lord's debtors by lessening their debts with a view to their recompensing him with their help, He said, \"And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness,\" that is to say, of money, even as the steward had done. Now we are all of us aware that money is the instigator[fn-66-P6629_1942932:1294-nf] of unrighteousness, and the lord of the whole world. Therefore, when he saw the covetousness of the Pharisees doing servile worship[fn-66-P6630_1943083:1295-nf] to it, He hurled[fn-66-P6631_1943120:1296-nf] this sentence against them, \"Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\"[fn-66-P6632_1943203:1297-nf] Then the Pharisees, who were covetous of riches, derided Him, when they understood that by mammon He meant money. Let no one think that under the word mammon the Creator was meant, and that Christ called them off from the service of the Creator. What folly! Rather learn therefrom that one God was pointed out by Christ. For they were two masters whom He named, God and mammon-the Creator and money. You cannot indeed serve God-Him, of course whom they seemed to serve-and mammon to whom they preferred to devote themselves.[fn-66-P6633_1943751:1298-nf] If, however, he was giving himself out as another god, it would not be two masters, but three, that he had pointed out. For the Creator was a master, and much more of a master, to be sure,[fn-66-P6634_1943984:1299-nf] than mammon, and more to be adored, as being more truly our Master. Now, how was it likely that He who had called mammon a master, and had associated him with God, should say nothing of Him who was really the Master of even these, that is, the Creator? Or else, by this silence respecting Him did He concede that service might be rendered to Him, since it was to Himself alone and to mammon that He said service could not be (simultaneously) rendered? When, therefore, He lays down the position that God is one, since He would have been sure to mention[fn-66-P6635_1944554:1300-nf] the Creator if He were Himself a rival[fn-66-P6636_1944615:1301-nf] to Him, He did (virtually) name the Creator, when He refrained from insisting\"[fn-66-P6637_1944710:1302-nf] that He was Master alone, without a rival god. Accordingly, this will throw light upon the sense in which it was said, \"If ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches? \"[fn-66-P6638_1944961:1303-nf] \"In the unrighteous mammon,\" that is to say, in unrighteous riches, not in the Creator; for even Marcion allows Him to be righteous: \"And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who will give to you that which is mine? \"[fn-66-P6639_1945226:1304-nf] For whatever is unrighteous ought to be foreign to the servants of God. But in what way was the Creator foreign to the Pharisees, seeing that He was the proper God of the Jewish nation? Forasmuch then as the words, \"Who will entrust to you the truer riches? \"and, \"Who will give you that which is mine? \"are only suitable to the Creator and not to mammon, He could not have uttered them as alien to the Creator, and in the interest of the rival god. He could only seem to have spoken them in this sense, if, when remarking[fn-66-P6640_1945846:1305-nf] their unfaithfulness to the Creator and not to mammon, He had drawn some distinctions between the Creator (in his manner of mentioning Him) and the rival god-how that the latter would not commit his own truth to those who were unfaithful to the Creator. How then can he possibly seem to belong to another god, if He be not set forth, with the express intention of being separated[fn-66-P6641_1946244:1306-nf] from the very thing which is in question. But when the Pharisees \"justified themselves before men,\"[fn-66-P6642_1946374:1307-nf] and placed their hope of reward in man, He censured them in the sense in which the prophet Jeremiah said, \"Cursed is the man that trust-eth in man.\"[fn-66-P6643_1946546:1308-nf] Since the prophet went on to say, \"But the Lord knoweth your hearts,\"[fn-66-P6644_1946639:1309-nf] he magnified the power of that God who declared Himself to be as a lamp, \"searching the reins and the heart.\"[fn-66-P6645_1946801:1310-nf] When He strikes at pride in the words: \"That which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God,\"[fn-66-P6646_1946940:1311-nf] He recalls Isaiah: \"For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is arrogant and lifted up, and they shall be brought low.\"[fn-66-P6647_1947148:1312-nf] I can now make out why Marcion's god was for so long an age concealed. He was, I suppose, waiting until he had learnt all these things from the Creator. He continued his pupillage up to the time of John, and then proceeded forthwith to announce the kingdom of God, saying: \"The law and the prophets were until John; since that time the kingdom of God is proclaimed.\"[fn-66-P6648_1947545:1313-nf] Just as if we also did not recognise in John a certain limit placed between the old dispensation and the new, at which Judaism ceased and Christianity began-without, however, supposing that it was by the power of another god that there came about a cessation[fn-66-P6649_1947827:1314-nf] of the law and the prophets and the commencement of that gospel in which is the kingdom of God, Christ Himself.

Moses, however, permitted repudiation in Deuteronomy: \"When a man hath taken a wife, and hath lived with her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found unchastity in her; then let him write her a bill of divorcement and give it in her hand, and send her away out of his house.\"[fn-66-P6659_1950781:1321-nf] You see, therefore, that there is a difference between the law and the gospel- between Moses and Christ?[fn-66-P6660_1950910:1322-nf] To be sure there is![fn-66-P6661_1950964:1323-nf] But then you have rejected that other gospel which witnesses to the same verity and the same Christ.[fn-66-P6662_1951081:1324-nf] There, while prohibiting divorce, He has given us a solution of this special question respecting it: \"Moses,\" says He, \"because of the hardness of your hearts, suffered you to give a bill of divorcement; but from the beginning it was not so\"[fn-66-P6663_1951354:1325-nf] -for this reason, indeed, because He who had \"made them male and female\" had likewise said, \"They twain shall become one flesh; what therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.\"[fn-66-P6664_1951572:1326-nf] Now, by this answer of His (to the Pharisees), He both sanctioned the provision of Moses, who was His own (servant), and restored to its primitive purpose[fn-66-P6665_1951753:1327-nf] the institution of the Creator, whose Christ He was. Since, however, you are to be refuted out of the Scriptures which you have received, I will meet you on your own ground, as if your Christ were mine. When, therefore, He prohibited divorce, and yet at the same time represented[fn-66-P6666_1952051:1328-nf] the Father, even Him who united male and female, must He not have rather exculpated[fn-66-P6667_1952153:1329-nf] than abolished the enactment of Moses? But, observe, if this Christ be yours when he teaches contrary to Moses and the Creator, on the same principle must He be mine if I can show that His teaching is not contrary to them. I maintain, then, that there was a condition in the prohibition which He now made of divorce; the case supposed being, that a man put away his wife for the express purpose of[fn-66-P6668_1952574:1330-nf] marrying another. His words are: \"Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband, also committeth adultery,\"[fn-66-P6669_1952791:1331-nf] -\"put away,\" that is, for the reason wherefore a woman ought not to be dismissed, that another wife may be obtained. For he who marries a woman who is unlawfully put away is as much of an adulterer as the man who marries one who is un-divorced. Permanent is the marriage which is not rightly dissolved; to marry,[fn-66-P6670_1953127:1332-nf] therefore, whilst matrimony is undissolved, is to commit adultery. Since, therefore, His prohibition of divorce was a conditional one, He did not prohibit absolutely; and what He did not absolutely forbid, that He permitted on some occasions,[fn-66-P6671_1953445:1333-nf] when there is an absence of the cause why He gave His prohibition. In very deed[fn-66-P6672_1953541:1334-nf] His teaching is not contrary to Moses, whose precept He partially[fn-66-P6673_1953651:1335-nf] defends, I will not[fn-66-P6674_1953689:1336-nf] say confirms. If, however, you deny that divorce is in any way permitted by Christ, how is it that you on your side[fn-66-P6675_1953822:1337-nf] destroy marriage, not uniting man and woman, nor admitting to the sacrament of baptism and of the eucharist those who have been united in marriage anywhere else,[fn-66-P6676_1953997:1338-nf] unless they should agree together to repudiate the fruit of their marriage, and so the very Creator Himself? Well, then, what is a husband to do in your sect,[fn-66-P6677_1954213:1339-nf] if his wife commit adultery? Shall he keep her? But your own apostle, you know,[fn-66-P6678_1954311:1340-nf] does not permit \"the members of Christ to be joined to a harlot.\"[fn-66-P6679_1954396:1341-nf] Divorce, therefore, when justly deserved,[fn-66-P6680_1954462:1342-nf] has even in Christ a defender. So that Moses for the future must be considered as being confirmed by Him, since he prohibits divorce in the same sense as Christ does, if any unchastity should occur in the wife. For in the Gospel of Matthew he says, \"Whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery.\"[fn-66-P6681_1954845:1343-nf] He also is deemed equally guilty of adultery, who marries a woman put away by her husband. The Creator, however, except on account of adultery, does not put asunder what He Himself joined together, the same Moses in another passage enacting that he who had married after violence to a damsel, should thenceforth not have it in his power to put away his wife.[fn-66-P6682_1955226:1344-nf] Now, if a compulsory marriage contracted after violence shall be permanent, how much rather shall a voluntary one, the result of agreement! This has the sanction of the prophet: \"Thou shalt not forsake the wife of thy youth.\"[fn-66-P6683_1955481:1345-nf] Thus you have Christ following spontaneously the tracks of the Creator everywhere, both in permitting divorce and in for-bidding it. You find Him also protecting marriage, in whatever direction you try to escape. He prohibits divorce when He will have the marriage inviolable; He permits divorce when the marriage is spotted with unfaithfulness. You should blush when you refuse to unite those whom even your Christ has united; and repeat the blush when you disunite them without the good reason why your Christ would have them separated. I have[fn-66-P6684_1956049:1346-nf] now to show whence the Lord derived this decision[fn-66-P6685_1956115:1347-nf] of His, and to what end He directed it. It will thus become more fully evident that His object was not the abolition of the Mosaic ordinance[fn-66-P6686_1956277:1348-nf] by any suddenly devised proposal of divorce; because it was not suddenly proposed, but had its root in the previously mentioned John. For John reproved Herod, because he had illegally married the wife of his deceased brother, who had a daughter by her (a union which the law permitted only on the one occasion of the brother dying childless,[fn-66-P6687_1956648:1349-nf] when it even prescribed such a marriage, in order that by his own brother, and from his own wife,[fn-66-P6688_1956811:1350-nf] seed might be reckoned to the deceased husband),[fn-66-P6689_1956904:1351-nf] and was in consequence cast into prison, and finally, by the same Herod, was even put to death. The Lord having therefore made mention of John, and of course of the occurrence of his death, hurled His censure[fn-66-P6690_1957139:1352-nf] against Herod in the form of unlawful marriages and of adultery, pronouncing as an adulterer even the man who married a woman that had been put away from her husband. This he said in order the more severely to load Herod with guilt, who had taken his brother's wife, after she had been loosed from her husband not less by death than by divorce; who had been impelled thereto by his lust, not by the prescription of the (Levirate) law-for, as his brother had left a daughter, the marriage with the widow could not be lawful on that very account;[fn-66-P6691_1957709:1353-nf] and who, when the prophet asserted against him the law, had therefore put him to death. The remarks I have advanced on this case will be also of use to me in illustrating the subsequent parable of the rich man[fn-66-P6692_1958021:1354-nf] tormented in hell, and the poor man resting in Abraham's bosom.[fn-66-P6693_1958128:1355-nf] For this passage, so far as its letter goes, comes before us abruptly; but if we regard its sense and purport, it naturally[fn-66-P6694_1958278:1356-nf] fits in with the mention of John wickedly slain, and of Herod, who had been condemned by him for his impious marriage.[fn-66-P6695_1958413:1357-nf] It sets forth in bold outline[fn-66-P6696_1958486:1358-nf] the end of both of them, the \"torments\" of Herod and the \"comfort\" of John, that even now Herod might hear that warning: \"They have there Moses and the prophets, let them hear them.\"[fn-66-P6697_1958689:1359-nf] Marcion, however, violently turns the passage to another end, and decides that both the torment and the comfort are retributions of the Creator reserved in the next life[fn-66-P6698_1958882:1360-nf] for those who have obeyed the law and the prophets; whilst he defines the heavenly bosom and harbour to belong to Christ and his own god. Our answer to this is, that the Scripture itself which dazzles[fn-66-P6699_1959142:1361-nf] his sight expressly distinguishes between Abraham's bosom, where the poor man dwells, and the infernal place of torment. \"Hell\" (I take it) means one thing, and \"Abraham's bosom\" another. \"A great gulf.\" is said to separate those regions, and to hinder a passage from one to the other. Besides, the rich man could not have \"lifted up his eyes,\"[fn-67-P6700_1959569:1362-nf] and from a distance too, except to a superior height, and from the said distance all up through the vast immensity of height and depth. It must therefore be evident to every man of intelligence who has ever heard of the Elysian fields, that there is some determinate place called Abraham's bosom, and that it is designed for the reception of the souls of Abraham's children, even from among the Gentiles (since he is \"the father of many nations,\" which must be classed amongst his family), and of the same faith as that wherewithal he himself believed God, without the yoke of the law and the sign of circumcision. This region, therefore, I call Abraham's bosom. Although it is not in heaven, it is yet higher than hell,[fn-67-P6701_1960313:1363-nf] and is appointed to afford an interval of rest to the souls of the righteous, until the consummation of all things shall complete the resurrection of all men with the \"full recompense of their reward.\"[fn-67-P6702_1960565:1364-nf] This consummation will then be manifested in heavenly promises, which Marcion, however, claims for his own god, just as if the Creator had never announced them. Amos, however, tells us of \"those stories towards heaven\"[fn-67-P6703_1960835:1365-nf] which Christ \"builds\"-of course for His people. There also is that everlasting abode of which Isaiah asks, \"Who shall declare unto you the eternal place, but He (that is, of course, Christ) who walketh in righteousness, speaketh of the straight path, hateth injustice and iniquity? \"[fn-67-P6704_1961363:1366-nf] Now, although this everlasting abode is promised, and the ascending stories (or steps) to heaven are built by the Creator, who further promises that the seed of Abraham shall be even as the stars of heaven, by virtue certainly of the heavenly promise, why may it not be possible,[fn-67-P6705_1961749:1367-nf] without any injury to that promise, that by Abraham's bosom is meant some temporary receptacle of faithful souls, wherein is even now delineated an image of the future, and where is given some foresight of the glory[fn-67-P6706_1961990:1368-nf] of both judgments? If so, you have here, O heretics, during your present lifetime, a warning that Moses and the prophets declare one only God, the Creator, and His only Christ, and how that both awards of everlasting punishment and eternal salvation rest with Him, the one only God, who kills and who makes alive. Well, but the admonition, says Marcion, of our God from heaven has commanded us not to hear Moses and the prophets, but Christ; Hear Him is the command.[fn-67-P6707_1962564:1369-nf] This is true enough. For the apostles had by that time sufficiently heard Moses and the prophets, for they had followed Christ, being persuaded by Moses and the prophets. For even Peter would not have been able[fn-67-P6708_1962835:1370-nf] to say, \"Thou art the Christ,\"[fn-67-P6709_1962892:1371-nf] unless he had beforehand heard and believed Moses and the prophets, by whom alone Christ had been hitherto announced. Their faith, indeed, had deserved this confirmation by such a voice from heaven as should bid them hear Him, whom they had recognized as preaching peace, announcing glad tidings, promising an everlasting abode, building for them steps upwards into heaven.[fn-67-P6710_1963289:1372-nf] Down in hell, however, it was said concerning them: \"They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them!\"-event hose who did not believe them or at least did not sincerely[fn-67-P6711_1963525:1373-nf] believe that after death there were punishments for the arrogance of wealth and the glory of luxury, announced indeed by Moses and the prophets, but decreed by that God, who deposes princes from their thrones, and raiseth up the poor from dunghills.[fn-67-P6712_1963792:1374-nf] Since, therefore, it is quite consistent in the Creator to pronounce different sentences in the two directions of reward and punishment, we shall have to conclude that there is here no diversity of gods,[fn-67-P6713_1964055:1375-nf] but only a difference in the actual matters[fn-67-P6714_1964138:1376-nf] before us.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":16,"verse":18,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":36,"source_paragraph":"118","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But Christ prohibits divorce, saying, \"Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband, also committeth adultery.\"[fn-66-P6658_1950353:1320-nf] In order to forbid divorce, He makes it unlawful to marry a woman that has been put away.

His words are: \"Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband, also committeth adultery,\"[fn-66-P6669_1952791:1331-nf] -\"put away,\" that is, for the reason wherefore a woman ought not to be dismissed, that another wife may be obtained. For he who marries a woman who is unlawfully put away is as much of an adulterer as the man who marries one who is un-divorced. Permanent is the marriage which is not rightly dissolved; to marry,[fn-66-P6670_1953127:1332-nf] therefore, whilst matrimony is undissolved, is to commit adultery. Since, therefore, His prohibition of divorce was a conditional one, He did not prohibit absolutely; and what He did not absolutely forbid, that He permitted on some occasions,[fn-66-P6671_1953445:1333-nf] when there is an absence of the cause why He gave His prohibition. In very deed[fn-66-P6672_1953541:1334-nf] His teaching is not contrary to Moses, whose precept He partially[fn-66-P6673_1953651:1335-nf] defends, I will not[fn-66-P6674_1953689:1336-nf] say confirms. If, however, you deny that divorce is in any way permitted by Christ, how is it that you on your side[fn-66-P6675_1953822:1337-nf] destroy marriage, not uniting man and woman, nor admitting to the sacrament of baptism and of the eucharist those who have been united in marriage anywhere else,[fn-66-P6676_1953997:1338-nf] unless they should agree together to repudiate the fruit of their marriage, and so the very Creator Himself? Well, then, what is a husband to do in your sect,[fn-66-P6677_1954213:1339-nf] if his wife commit adultery? Shall he keep her? But your own apostle, you know,[fn-66-P6678_1954311:1340-nf] does not permit \"the members of Christ to be joined to a harlot.\"[fn-66-P6679_1954396:1341-nf] Divorce, therefore, when justly deserved,[fn-66-P6680_1954462:1342-nf] has even in Christ a defender. So that Moses for the future must be considered as being confirmed by Him, since he prohibits divorce in the same sense as Christ does, if any unchastity should occur in the wife. For in the Gospel of Matthew he says, \"Whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery.\"[fn-66-P6681_1954845:1343-nf] He also is deemed equally guilty of adultery, who marries a woman put away by her husband. The Creator, however, except on account of adultery, does not put asunder what He Himself joined together, the same Moses in another passage enacting that he who had married after violence to a damsel, should thenceforth not have it in his power to put away his wife.[fn-66-P6682_1955226:1344-nf] Now, if a compulsory marriage contracted after violence shall be permanent, how much rather shall a voluntary one, the result of agreement! This has the sanction of the prophet: \"Thou shalt not forsake the wife of thy youth.\"[fn-66-P6683_1955481:1345-nf] Thus you have Christ following spontaneously the tracks of the Creator everywhere, both in permitting divorce and in for-bidding it. You find Him also protecting marriage, in whatever direction you try to escape. He prohibits divorce when He will have the marriage inviolable; He permits divorce when the marriage is spotted with unfaithfulness. You should blush when you refuse to unite those whom even your Christ has united; and repeat the blush when you disunite them without the good reason why your Christ would have them separated. I have[fn-66-P6684_1956049:1346-nf] now to show whence the Lord derived this decision[fn-66-P6685_1956115:1347-nf] of His, and to what end He directed it. It will thus become more fully evident that His object was not the abolition of the Mosaic ordinance[fn-66-P6686_1956277:1348-nf] by any suddenly devised proposal of divorce; because it was not suddenly proposed, but had its root in the previously mentioned John. For John reproved Herod, because he had illegally married the wife of his deceased brother, who had a daughter by her (a union which the law permitted only on the one occasion of the brother dying childless,[fn-66-P6687_1956648:1349-nf] when it even prescribed such a marriage, in order that by his own brother, and from his own wife,[fn-66-P6688_1956811:1350-nf] seed might be reckoned to the deceased husband),[fn-66-P6689_1956904:1351-nf] and was in consequence cast into prison, and finally, by the same Herod, was even put to death. The Lord having therefore made mention of John, and of course of the occurrence of his death, hurled His censure[fn-66-P6690_1957139:1352-nf] against Herod in the form of unlawful marriages and of adultery, pronouncing as an adulterer even the man who married a woman that had been put away from her husband. This he said in order the more severely to load Herod with guilt, who had taken his brother's wife, after she had been loosed from her husband not less by death than by divorce; who had been impelled thereto by his lust, not by the prescription of the (Levirate) law-for, as his brother had left a daughter, the marriage with the widow could not be lawful on that very account;[fn-66-P6691_1957709:1353-nf] and who, when the prophet asserted against him the law, had therefore put him to death. The remarks I have advanced on this case will be also of use to me in illustrating the subsequent parable of the rich man[fn-66-P6692_1958021:1354-nf] tormented in hell, and the poor man resting in Abraham's bosom.[fn-66-P6693_1958128:1355-nf] For this passage, so far as its letter goes, comes before us abruptly; but if we regard its sense and purport, it naturally[fn-66-P6694_1958278:1356-nf] fits in with the mention of John wickedly slain, and of Herod, who had been condemned by him for his impious marriage.[fn-66-P6695_1958413:1357-nf] It sets forth in bold outline[fn-66-P6696_1958486:1358-nf] the end of both of them, the \"torments\" of Herod and the \"comfort\" of John, that even now Herod might hear that warning: \"They have there Moses and the prophets, let them hear them.\"[fn-66-P6697_1958689:1359-nf] Marcion, however, violently turns the passage to another end, and decides that both the torment and the comfort are retributions of the Creator reserved in the next life[fn-66-P6698_1958882:1360-nf] for those who have obeyed the law and the prophets; whilst he defines the heavenly bosom and harbour to belong to Christ and his own god. Our answer to this is, that the Scripture itself which dazzles[fn-66-P6699_1959142:1361-nf] his sight expressly distinguishes between Abraham's bosom, where the poor man dwells, and the infernal place of torment. \"Hell\" (I take it) means one thing, and \"Abraham's bosom\" another. \"A great gulf.\" is said to separate those regions, and to hinder a passage from one to the other. Besides, the rich man could not have \"lifted up his eyes,\"[fn-67-P6700_1959569:1362-nf] and from a distance too, except to a superior height, and from the said distance all up through the vast immensity of height and depth. It must therefore be evident to every man of intelligence who has ever heard of the Elysian fields, that there is some determinate place called Abraham's bosom, and that it is designed for the reception of the souls of Abraham's children, even from among the Gentiles (since he is \"the father of many nations,\" which must be classed amongst his family), and of the same faith as that wherewithal he himself believed God, without the yoke of the law and the sign of circumcision. This region, therefore, I call Abraham's bosom. Although it is not in heaven, it is yet higher than hell,[fn-67-P6701_1960313:1363-nf] and is appointed to afford an interval of rest to the souls of the righteous, until the consummation of all things shall complete the resurrection of all men with the \"full recompense of their reward.\"[fn-67-P6702_1960565:1364-nf] This consummation will then be manifested in heavenly promises, which Marcion, however, claims for his own god, just as if the Creator had never announced them. Amos, however, tells us of \"those stories towards heaven\"[fn-67-P6703_1960835:1365-nf] which Christ \"builds\"-of course for His people. There also is that everlasting abode of which Isaiah asks, \"Who shall declare unto you the eternal place, but He (that is, of course, Christ) who walketh in righteousness, speaketh of the straight path, hateth injustice and iniquity? \"[fn-67-P6704_1961363:1366-nf] Now, although this everlasting abode is promised, and the ascending stories (or steps) to heaven are built by the Creator, who further promises that the seed of Abraham shall be even as the stars of heaven, by virtue certainly of the heavenly promise, why may it not be possible,[fn-67-P6705_1961749:1367-nf] without any injury to that promise, that by Abraham's bosom is meant some temporary receptacle of faithful souls, wherein is even now delineated an image of the future, and where is given some foresight of the glory[fn-67-P6706_1961990:1368-nf] of both judgments? If so, you have here, O heretics, during your present lifetime, a warning that Moses and the prophets declare one only God, the Creator, and His only Christ, and how that both awards of everlasting punishment and eternal salvation rest with Him, the one only God, who kills and who makes alive. Well, but the admonition, says Marcion, of our God from heaven has commanded us not to hear Moses and the prophets, but Christ; Hear Him is the command.[fn-67-P6707_1962564:1369-nf] This is true enough. For the apostles had by that time sufficiently heard Moses and the prophets, for they had followed Christ, being persuaded by Moses and the prophets. For even Peter would not have been able[fn-67-P6708_1962835:1370-nf] to say, \"Thou art the Christ,\"[fn-67-P6709_1962892:1371-nf] unless he had beforehand heard and believed Moses and the prophets, by whom alone Christ had been hitherto announced. Their faith, indeed, had deserved this confirmation by such a voice from heaven as should bid them hear Him, whom they had recognized as preaching peace, announcing glad tidings, promising an everlasting abode, building for them steps upwards into heaven.[fn-67-P6710_1963289:1372-nf] Down in hell, however, it was said concerning them: \"They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them!\"-event hose who did not believe them or at least did not sincerely[fn-67-P6711_1963525:1373-nf] believe that after death there were punishments for the arrogance of wealth and the glory of luxury, announced indeed by Moses and the prophets, but decreed by that God, who deposes princes from their thrones, and raiseth up the poor from dunghills.[fn-67-P6712_1963792:1374-nf] Since, therefore, it is quite consistent in the Creator to pronounce different sentences in the two directions of reward and punishment, we shall have to conclude that there is here no diversity of gods,[fn-67-P6713_1964055:1375-nf] but only a difference in the actual matters[fn-67-P6714_1964138:1376-nf] before us.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":16,"verse":19,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":36,"source_paragraph":"118","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But Christ prohibits divorce, saying, \"Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband, also committeth adultery.\"[fn-66-P6658_1950353:1320-nf] In order to forbid divorce, He makes it unlawful to marry a woman that has been put away. Moses, however, permitted repudiation in Deuteronomy: \"When a man hath taken a wife, and hath lived with her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found unchastity in her; then let him write her a bill of divorcement and give it in her hand, and send her away out of his house.\"[fn-66-P6659_1950781:1321-nf] You see, therefore, that there is a difference between the law and the gospel- between Moses and Christ?[fn-66-P6660_1950910:1322-nf] To be sure there is![fn-66-P6661_1950964:1323-nf] But then you have rejected that other gospel which witnesses to the same verity and the same Christ.[fn-66-P6662_1951081:1324-nf] There, while prohibiting divorce, He has given us a solution of this special question respecting it: \"Moses,\" says He, \"because of the hardness of your hearts, suffered you to give a bill of divorcement; but from the beginning it was not so\"[fn-66-P6663_1951354:1325-nf] -for this reason, indeed, because He who had \"made them male and female\" had likewise said, \"They twain shall become one flesh; what therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.\"[fn-66-P6664_1951572:1326-nf] Now, by this answer of His (to the Pharisees), He both sanctioned the provision of Moses, who was His own (servant), and restored to its primitive purpose[fn-66-P6665_1951753:1327-nf] the institution of the Creator, whose Christ He was. Since, however, you are to be refuted out of the Scriptures which you have received, I will meet you on your own ground, as if your Christ were mine. When, therefore, He prohibited divorce, and yet at the same time represented[fn-66-P6666_1952051:1328-nf] the Father, even Him who united male and female, must He not have rather exculpated[fn-66-P6667_1952153:1329-nf] than abolished the enactment of Moses? But, observe, if this Christ be yours when he teaches contrary to Moses and the Creator, on the same principle must He be mine if I can show that His teaching is not contrary to them. I maintain, then, that there was a condition in the prohibition which He now made of divorce; the case supposed being, that a man put away his wife for the express purpose of[fn-66-P6668_1952574:1330-nf] marrying another.

Moses, however, permitted repudiation in Deuteronomy: \"When a man hath taken a wife, and hath lived with her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found unchastity in her; then let him write her a bill of divorcement and give it in her hand, and send her away out of his house.\"[fn-66-P6659_1950781:1321-nf] You see, therefore, that there is a difference between the law and the gospel- between Moses and Christ?[fn-66-P6660_1950910:1322-nf] To be sure there is![fn-66-P6661_1950964:1323-nf] But then you have rejected that other gospel which witnesses to the same verity and the same Christ.[fn-66-P6662_1951081:1324-nf] There, while prohibiting divorce, He has given us a solution of this special question respecting it: \"Moses,\" says He, \"because of the hardness of your hearts, suffered you to give a bill of divorcement; but from the beginning it was not so\"[fn-66-P6663_1951354:1325-nf] -for this reason, indeed, because He who had \"made them male and female\" had likewise said, \"They twain shall become one flesh; what therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.\"[fn-66-P6664_1951572:1326-nf] Now, by this answer of His (to the Pharisees), He both sanctioned the provision of Moses, who was His own (servant), and restored to its primitive purpose[fn-66-P6665_1951753:1327-nf] the institution of the Creator, whose Christ He was. Since, however, you are to be refuted out of the Scriptures which you have received, I will meet you on your own ground, as if your Christ were mine. When, therefore, He prohibited divorce, and yet at the same time represented[fn-66-P6666_1952051:1328-nf] the Father, even Him who united male and female, must He not have rather exculpated[fn-66-P6667_1952153:1329-nf] than abolished the enactment of Moses? But, observe, if this Christ be yours when he teaches contrary to Moses and the Creator, on the same principle must He be mine if I can show that His teaching is not contrary to them. I maintain, then, that there was a condition in the prohibition which He now made of divorce; the case supposed being, that a man put away his wife for the express purpose of[fn-66-P6668_1952574:1330-nf] marrying another. His words are: \"Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband, also committeth adultery,\"[fn-66-P6669_1952791:1331-nf] -\"put away,\" that is, for the reason wherefore a woman ought not to be dismissed, that another wife may be obtained. For he who marries a woman who is unlawfully put away is as much of an adulterer as the man who marries one who is un-divorced. Permanent is the marriage which is not rightly dissolved; to marry,[fn-66-P6670_1953127:1332-nf] therefore, whilst matrimony is undissolved, is to commit adultery. Since, therefore, His prohibition of divorce was a conditional one, He did not prohibit absolutely; and what He did not absolutely forbid, that He permitted on some occasions,[fn-66-P6671_1953445:1333-nf] when there is an absence of the cause why He gave His prohibition. In very deed[fn-66-P6672_1953541:1334-nf] His teaching is not contrary to Moses, whose precept He partially[fn-66-P6673_1953651:1335-nf] defends, I will not[fn-66-P6674_1953689:1336-nf] say confirms. If, however, you deny that divorce is in any way permitted by Christ, how is it that you on your side[fn-66-P6675_1953822:1337-nf] destroy marriage, not uniting man and woman, nor admitting to the sacrament of baptism and of the eucharist those who have been united in marriage anywhere else,[fn-66-P6676_1953997:1338-nf] unless they should agree together to repudiate the fruit of their marriage, and so the very Creator Himself? Well, then, what is a husband to do in your sect,[fn-66-P6677_1954213:1339-nf] if his wife commit adultery? Shall he keep her? But your own apostle, you know,[fn-66-P6678_1954311:1340-nf] does not permit \"the members of Christ to be joined to a harlot.\"[fn-66-P6679_1954396:1341-nf] Divorce, therefore, when justly deserved,[fn-66-P6680_1954462:1342-nf] has even in Christ a defender. So that Moses for the future must be considered as being confirmed by Him, since he prohibits divorce in the same sense as Christ does, if any unchastity should occur in the wife. For in the Gospel of Matthew he says, \"Whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery.\"[fn-66-P6681_1954845:1343-nf] He also is deemed equally guilty of adultery, who marries a woman put away by her husband. The Creator, however, except on account of adultery, does not put asunder what He Himself joined together, the same Moses in another passage enacting that he who had married after violence to a damsel, should thenceforth not have it in his power to put away his wife.[fn-66-P6682_1955226:1344-nf] Now, if a compulsory marriage contracted after violence shall be permanent, how much rather shall a voluntary one, the result of agreement! This has the sanction of the prophet: \"Thou shalt not forsake the wife of thy youth.\"[fn-66-P6683_1955481:1345-nf] Thus you have Christ following spontaneously the tracks of the Creator everywhere, both in permitting divorce and in for-bidding it. You find Him also protecting marriage, in whatever direction you try to escape. He prohibits divorce when He will have the marriage inviolable; He permits divorce when the marriage is spotted with unfaithfulness. You should blush when you refuse to unite those whom even your Christ has united; and repeat the blush when you disunite them without the good reason why your Christ would have them separated. I have[fn-66-P6684_1956049:1346-nf] now to show whence the Lord derived this decision[fn-66-P6685_1956115:1347-nf] of His, and to what end He directed it. It will thus become more fully evident that His object was not the abolition of the Mosaic ordinance[fn-66-P6686_1956277:1348-nf] by any suddenly devised proposal of divorce; because it was not suddenly proposed, but had its root in the previously mentioned John. For John reproved Herod, because he had illegally married the wife of his deceased brother, who had a daughter by her (a union which the law permitted only on the one occasion of the brother dying childless,[fn-66-P6687_1956648:1349-nf] when it even prescribed such a marriage, in order that by his own brother, and from his own wife,[fn-66-P6688_1956811:1350-nf] seed might be reckoned to the deceased husband),[fn-66-P6689_1956904:1351-nf] and was in consequence cast into prison, and finally, by the same Herod, was even put to death. The Lord having therefore made mention of John, and of course of the occurrence of his death, hurled His censure[fn-66-P6690_1957139:1352-nf] against Herod in the form of unlawful marriages and of adultery, pronouncing as an adulterer even the man who married a woman that had been put away from her husband. This he said in order the more severely to load Herod with guilt, who had taken his brother's wife, after she had been loosed from her husband not less by death than by divorce; who had been impelled thereto by his lust, not by the prescription of the (Levirate) law-for, as his brother had left a daughter, the marriage with the widow could not be lawful on that very account;[fn-66-P6691_1957709:1353-nf] and who, when the prophet asserted against him the law, had therefore put him to death. The remarks I have advanced on this case will be also of use to me in illustrating the subsequent parable of the rich man[fn-66-P6692_1958021:1354-nf] tormented in hell, and the poor man resting in Abraham's bosom.[fn-66-P6693_1958128:1355-nf] For this passage, so far as its letter goes, comes before us abruptly; but if we regard its sense and purport, it naturally[fn-66-P6694_1958278:1356-nf] fits in with the mention of John wickedly slain, and of Herod, who had been condemned by him for his impious marriage.[fn-66-P6695_1958413:1357-nf] It sets forth in bold outline[fn-66-P6696_1958486:1358-nf] the end of both of them, the \"torments\" of Herod and the \"comfort\" of John, that even now Herod might hear that warning: \"They have there Moses and the prophets, let them hear them.\"[fn-66-P6697_1958689:1359-nf] Marcion, however, violently turns the passage to another end, and decides that both the torment and the comfort are retributions of the Creator reserved in the next life[fn-66-P6698_1958882:1360-nf] for those who have obeyed the law and the prophets; whilst he defines the heavenly bosom and harbour to belong to Christ and his own god. Our answer to this is, that the Scripture itself which dazzles[fn-66-P6699_1959142:1361-nf] his sight expressly distinguishes between Abraham's bosom, where the poor man dwells, and the infernal place of torment. \"Hell\" (I take it) means one thing, and \"Abraham's bosom\" another. \"A great gulf.\" is said to separate those regions, and to hinder a passage from one to the other. Besides, the rich man could not have \"lifted up his eyes,\"[fn-67-P6700_1959569:1362-nf] and from a distance too, except to a superior height, and from the said distance all up through the vast immensity of height and depth. It must therefore be evident to every man of intelligence who has ever heard of the Elysian fields, that there is some determinate place called Abraham's bosom, and that it is designed for the reception of the souls of Abraham's children, even from among the Gentiles (since he is \"the father of many nations,\" which must be classed amongst his family), and of the same faith as that wherewithal he himself believed God, without the yoke of the law and the sign of circumcision. This region, therefore, I call Abraham's bosom. Although it is not in heaven, it is yet higher than hell,[fn-67-P6701_1960313:1363-nf] and is appointed to afford an interval of rest to the souls of the righteous, until the consummation of all things shall complete the resurrection of all men with the \"full recompense of their reward.\"[fn-67-P6702_1960565:1364-nf] This consummation will then be manifested in heavenly promises, which Marcion, however, claims for his own god, just as if the Creator had never announced them. Amos, however, tells us of \"those stories towards heaven\"[fn-67-P6703_1960835:1365-nf] which Christ \"builds\"-of course for His people. There also is that everlasting abode of which Isaiah asks, \"Who shall declare unto you the eternal place, but He (that is, of course, Christ) who walketh in righteousness, speaketh of the straight path, hateth injustice and iniquity? \"[fn-67-P6704_1961363:1366-nf] Now, although this everlasting abode is promised, and the ascending stories (or steps) to heaven are built by the Creator, who further promises that the seed of Abraham shall be even as the stars of heaven, by virtue certainly of the heavenly promise, why may it not be possible,[fn-67-P6705_1961749:1367-nf] without any injury to that promise, that by Abraham's bosom is meant some temporary receptacle of faithful souls, wherein is even now delineated an image of the future, and where is given some foresight of the glory[fn-67-P6706_1961990:1368-nf] of both judgments? If so, you have here, O heretics, during your present lifetime, a warning that Moses and the prophets declare one only God, the Creator, and His only Christ, and how that both awards of everlasting punishment and eternal salvation rest with Him, the one only God, who kills and who makes alive. Well, but the admonition, says Marcion, of our God from heaven has commanded us not to hear Moses and the prophets, but Christ; Hear Him is the command.[fn-67-P6707_1962564:1369-nf] This is true enough. For the apostles had by that time sufficiently heard Moses and the prophets, for they had followed Christ, being persuaded by Moses and the prophets. For even Peter would not have been able[fn-67-P6708_1962835:1370-nf] to say, \"Thou art the Christ,\"[fn-67-P6709_1962892:1371-nf] unless he had beforehand heard and believed Moses and the prophets, by whom alone Christ had been hitherto announced.

If so, you have here, O heretics, during your present lifetime, a warning that Moses and the prophets declare one only God, the Creator, and His only Christ, and how that both awards of everlasting punishment and eternal salvation rest with Him, the one only God, who kills and who makes alive. Well, but the admonition, says Marcion, of our God from heaven has commanded us not to hear Moses and the prophets, but Christ; Hear Him is the command.[fn-67-P6707_1962564:1369-nf] This is true enough. For the apostles had by that time sufficiently heard Moses and the prophets, for they had followed Christ, being persuaded by Moses and the prophets. For even Peter would not have been able[fn-67-P6708_1962835:1370-nf] to say, \"Thou art the Christ,\"[fn-67-P6709_1962892:1371-nf] unless he had beforehand heard and believed Moses and the prophets, by whom alone Christ had been hitherto announced. Their faith, indeed, had deserved this confirmation by such a voice from heaven as should bid them hear Him, whom they had recognized as preaching peace, announcing glad tidings, promising an everlasting abode, building for them steps upwards into heaven.[fn-67-P6710_1963289:1372-nf] Down in hell, however, it was said concerning them: \"They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them!\"-event hose who did not believe them or at least did not sincerely[fn-67-P6711_1963525:1373-nf] believe that after death there were punishments for the arrogance of wealth and the glory of luxury, announced indeed by Moses and the prophets, but decreed by that God, who deposes princes from their thrones, and raiseth up the poor from dunghills.[fn-67-P6712_1963792:1374-nf] Since, therefore, it is quite consistent in the Creator to pronounce different sentences in the two directions of reward and punishment, we shall have to conclude that there is here no diversity of gods,[fn-67-P6713_1964055:1375-nf] but only a difference in the actual matters[fn-67-P6714_1964138:1376-nf] before us.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":16,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_26_homily_xx_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"For even if the common day of the consummation never overtake us, the end of each one is at the doors, whether he be old or young; and it is not possible for men after they have gone hence, either to buy oil any more, or to obtain pardon by prayers, though he that entreats be Abraham,[fn-21-P2177_728354:22-nf] or Noah, or Job, or Daniel.[fn-21-P2178_728404:23-nf] ","title":"Homily XX.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":16,"verse":16,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"ANF-03","text":"The epistle which we also allow to be the most decisive[fn-71-P7190_2082679:45-nf] against Judaism, is that wherein the apostle instructs the Galatians. For the abolition of the ancient law we fully admit, and hold that it actually proceeds from the dispensation of the Creator,-a point which we have already often treated in the course of our discussion, when we showed that the innovation was foretold by the prophets of our God.[fn-71-P7191_2083046:46-nf] Now, if the Creator indeed promised that \"the ancient things should pass away,\"[fn-71-P7192_2083190:47-nf] to be superseded by a new course of things which should arise, whilst Christ marks the period of the separation when He says, \"The law and the prophets were until John\"[fn-71-P7193_2083422:48-nf] -thus making the Baptist the limit between the two dispensations of the old things then terminating-and the new things then beginning, the apostle cannot of course do otherwise, (coming as he does) in Christ, who was revealed after John, than invalidate \"the old things\" and confirm \"the new,\" and yet promote thereby the faith of no other god than the Creator, at whose instance[fn-71-P7194_2083821:49-nf] it was foretold that the ancient things should pass away. Therefore both the abrogation of the law and the establishment of the gospel help my argument even in this epistle, wherein they both have reference to the fond assumption of the Galatians, which led them to suppose that faith in Christ (the Creator's Christ, of course) was obligatory, but without annulling the law, because it still appeared to them a thing incredible that the law should be set aside by its own author. Again,[fn-71-P7195_2084325:50-nf] if they had at all heard of any other god from the apostle, would they not have concluded at once, of themselves, that they must give up the law of that God whom they had left, in order to follow another? For what man would be long in learning, that he ought to pursue a new discipline, after he had taken up with a new god? Since, however,[fn-71-P7196_2084678:51-nf] the same God was declared in the gospel which had always been so well known in the law, the only change being in the dispensation,[fn-71-P7197_2084825:52-nf] the sole point of the question to be discussed was, whether the law of the Creator ought by the gospel to be excluded in the Christ of the Creator? Take away this point, and the controversy falls to the ground. Now, since they would all know of themselves,[fn-71-P7198_2085099:53-nf] on the withdrawal of this point, that they must of course renounce all submission to the Creator by reason of their faith in another god, there could have been no call for the apostle to teach them so earnestly that which their own belief must have spontaneously suggested to them. Therefore the entire purport of this epistle is simply to show us that the supersession[fn-71-P7199_2085482:54-nf] of the law comes from the appointment of the Creator-a point, which we shall still have to keep in mind.[fn-72-P7200_2085606:55-nf] Since also he makes mention of no other god (and he could have found no other opportunity of doing so, more suitable than when his purpose was to set forth the reason for the abolition of the law-especially as the prescription of a new god would have afforded a singularly good and most sufficient reason), it is clear enough in what sense he writes, \"I marvel that ye are so soon removed from Him who hath called you to His grace to another gospel\"[fn-72-P7201_2086082:56-nf] -He means) \"another\" as to the conduct it prescribes, not in respect of its worship; \"another\" as to the discipline it teaches, not in respect of its divinity; because it is the office of[fn-72-P7202_2086289:57-nf] Christ's gospel to call men from the law to grace, not from the Creator to another god. For nobody had induced them to apostatize from[fn-72-P7203_2086438:58-nf] the Creator, that they should seem to \"be removed to another gospel,\" simply when they return again to the Creator. When he adds, too, the words, \"which is not another,\"[fn-72-P7204_2086630:59-nf] he confirms the fact that the gospel which he maintains is the Creator's. For the Creator Himself promises the gospel, when He says by Isaiah: \"Get thee up into the high mountain, thou that bringest to Sion good tidings; lift up thy voice with strength, thou that bringest the gospel to Jerusalem.\"[fn-72-P7205_2086945:60-nf] Also when, with respect to the apostles personally, He says, \"How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, that bring good tidings of good\"[fn-72-P7206_2087139:61-nf] -even proclaiming the gospel to the Gentiles, because He also says, \"In His name shall the Gentiles trust; \"[fn-72-P7207_2087266:62-nf] that is, in the name of Christ, to whom He says, \"I have given thee as a light of the Gentiles.\"[fn-72-P7208_2087764:63-nf] However, you will have it that it is the gospel of a new god which was then set forth by the apostle. So that there are two gospels for[fn-72-P7209_2087919:64-nf] two gods; and the apostle made a great mistake when he said that \"there is not another\" gospel,[fn-72-P7210_2088045:65-nf] since there is (on the hypothesis)[fn-72-P7211_2088096:66-nf] another; and so he might have made a better defence of his gospel, by rather demonstrating this, than by insisting on its being but one. But perhaps, to avoid this difficulty, you will say that he therefore added just afterwards, \"Though an angel from heaven preach any other gospel, let him be accursed,\"[fn-72-P7212_2088416:67-nf] because he was aware that the Creator was going to introduce a gospel! But you thus entangle yourself still more. For this is now the mesh in which you are caught. To affirm that there are two gospels, is not the part of a man who has already denied that there is another. His meaning, however, is clear, for he has mentioned himself first (in the anathema): \"But though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel.\"[fn-72-P7213_2088856:68-nf] It is by way of an example that he has expressed himself. If even he himself might not preach any other gospel, then neither might an angel. He said \"angel\" in this way, that he might show how much more men ought not to be believed, when neither an angel nor an apostle ought to be; not that he meant to apply[fn-72-P7214_2089182:69-nf] an angel to the gospel of the Creator. He then cursorily touches on his own conversion from a persecutor to an apostle-confirming thereby the Acts of the Apostles,[fn-72-P7215_2089361:70-nf] in which book may be found the very subject[fn-72-P7216_2089477:71-nf] of this epistle, how that certain persons interposed, and said that men ought to be circumcised, and that the law of Moses was to be observed; and how the apostles, when consulted, determined, by the authority of the Holy Ghost, that \"a yoke should not be put upon men's necks which their fathers even had not been able to bear.\"[fn-72-P7217_2089826:72-nf] Now, since the Acts of the Apostles thus agree with Paul, it becomes apparent why you reject them. It is because they declare no other God than the Creator, and prove Christ to belong to no other God than the Creator; whilst the promise of the Holy Ghost is shown to have been fulfilled in no other document than the Acts of the Apostles. Now, it is not very likely that these[fn-72-P7218_2090256:73-nf] should be found in agreement with the apostle, on the one hand, when they described his career in accordance with his own statement; but should, on the other hand, be at variance with him when they announce the (attribute of) divinity in the Creator's Christ-as if Paul did not follow[fn-72-P7219_2090615:74-nf] the preaching of the apostles when he received from them the prescription[fn-72-P7220_2090714:75-nf] of not teaching the Law.[fn-72-P7221_2090752:76-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":16,"verse":16,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"44","folder":"ANF-03","text":"\"The head of every man is Christ.\"[fn-75-P7506_2154731:338-nf] What Christ, if He is not the author of man?

Surely of him concerning whom he adds soon afterwards: \"The man ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image of God.\"[fn-75-P7507_2155063:339-nf] Since then he is the image of the Creator (for He, when looking on Christ His Word, who was to become man, said, \"Let us make man in our own image, after our likeness\"[fn-75-P7508_2155252:340-nf] ), how can I possibly have another head but Him whose image I am? For if I am the image of the Creator there is no room in me for another head But wherefore \"ought the woman to have power over her head, because of the angels? \"[fn-75-P7509_2155499:341-nf] If it is because \"she was created for the man,\"[fn-75-P7510_2155569:342-nf] and taken out of the man, according to the Creator's purpose, then in this way too has the apostle maintained the discipline of that God from whose institution he explains the reasons of His discipline. He adds: \"Because of the angels.\"[fn-75-P7511_2155827:343-nf] What angels? In other words, whose angels? If he means the fallen angels of the Creator,[fn-75-P7512_2155938:344-nf] there is great propriety in his meaning. It is right that that face which was a snare to them should wear some mark of a humble guise and obscured beauty. If, however, the angels of the rival god are referred to, what fear is there for them? for not even Marcion's disciples, (to say nothing of his angels, ) have any desire for women. We have often shown before now, that the apostle classes heresies as evil[fn-75-P7513_2156431:345-nf] among \"works of the flesh,\" and that he would have those persons accounted estimable[fn-75-P7514_2156542:346-nf] who shun heresies as an evil thing. In like manner, when treating of the gospel,[fn-75-P7515_2156654:347-nf] we have proved from the sacrament of the bread and the cup[fn-75-P7516_2156753:348-nf] the verity of the Lord's body and blood in opposition to Marcion's phantom; whilst throughout almost the whole of my work it has been contended that all mention of judicial attributes points conclusively to the Creator as to a God who judges. Now, on the subject of \"spiritual gifts,\"[fn-75-P7517_2157084:349-nf] I have to remark that these also were promised by the Creator through Christ; and I think that we may derive from this a very just conclusion that the bestowal of a gift is not the work of a god other than Him who is proved to have given the promise. Here is a prophecy of Isaiah \"There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a flower[fn-75-P7518_2157455:350-nf] shall spring up from his root; and upon Him shall rest the Spirit of the Lord.\" After which he enumerates the special gifts of the same \"The spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of religion.[fn-75-P7519_2157733:351-nf] And with the fear of the Lord[fn-75-P7520_2157801:352-nf] shall the Spirit fill Him.\"[fn-75-P7521_2157867:353-nf] In this figure of a flower he shows that Christ was to arise out of the rod which sprang from the stem of Jesse; in other words, from the virgin of the race of David, the son of Jesse. In this Christ the whole substantia of the Spirit would have to rest, not meaning that it would be as it were some subsequent acquisition accruing to Him who was always, even before His incarnation, the Spirit of God;[fn-75-P7522_2158291:354-nf] so that you cannot argue from this that the prophecy has reference to that Christ who (as mere man of the race only of David) was to obtain the Spirit of his God. (The prophet says, ) on the contrary, that from the time when (the true Christ) should appear in the flesh as the flower predicted,[fn-75-P7523_2158731:355-nf] rising from the root of Jesse, there would have to rest upon Him the entire operation of the Spirit of grace, which, so far as the Jews were concerned, would cease and come to an end. This result the case itself shows; for after this time the Spirit of the Creator never breathed amongst them. From Judah were taken away \"the wise man, and the cunning artificer, and the counsellor, and the prophet; \"[fn-75-P7524_2159162:356-nf] that so it might prove true that \"the law and the prophets were until John.\"[fn-75-P7525_2159266:357-nf] Now hear how he declared that by Christ Himself, when returned to heaven, these spiritual gifts were to be sent: \"He ascended up. on high,\" that is, into heaven; \"He led captivity captive,\" meaning death or slavery of man; \"He gave gifts to the sons of men,\"[fn-75-P7526_2159546:358-nf] that is, the gratuities, which we call charismata. He says specifically \"sons of men,\"[fn-75-P7527_2159690:359-nf] and not men promiscuously; thus exhibiting to us those who were the children of men truly so called, choice men, apostles. \"For,\" says he, \"I have begotten you through the gospel; \"[fn-75-P7528_2159927:360-nf] and \"Ye are my children, of whom I travail again in birth.\"[fn-75-P7529_2160009:361-nf] Now was absolutely fulfilled that promise of the Spirit which was given by the word of Joel: \"In the last days will I pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and their sons and their daughters shall prophesy; and upon my servants and upon my handmaids will I pour out of my Spirit.\"[fn-75-P7530_2160310:362-nf] Since, then, the Creator promised the gift of His Spirit in the latter days; and since Christ has in these last days appeared as the dispenser of spiritual gifts (as the apostle says, \"When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son; \"[fn-75-P7531_2160624:363-nf] and again, \"This I say, brethren, that the time is short\"[fn-75-P7532_2160701:364-nf] ), it evidently follows in connection with this prediction of the last days, that this gift of the Spirit belongs to Him who is the Christ of the predicters. Now compare the Spirit's specific graces, as they are described by the apostle, and promised by the prophet Isaiah. \"To one is given,\" says he, \"by the Spirit the word of wisdom; \"this we see at once is what Isaiah declared to be \"the spirit of wisdom.\" \"To another, the word of knowledge; \"this will be \"the (prophet's) spirit of understanding and counsel.\" \"To another, faith by the same Spirit; \"this will be \"the spirit of religion and the fear of the Lord.\" \"To another, the gifts of healing, and to another the working of miracles; \"this will be \"the spirit of might.\" \"To another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another divers kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues; \"this will be \"the spirit of knowledge.\"[fn-75-P7533_2161674:365-nf] See how the apostle agrees with the prophet both in making the distribution of the one Spirit, and in interpreting His special graces. This, too, I may confidently say: he who has likened the unity of our body throughout its manifold and divers members to the compacting together of the various gifts of the Spirit,[fn-75-P7534_2162038:366-nf] shows also that there is but one Lord of the human body and of the Holy Spirit. This Spirit, (according to the apostle's showing, )[fn-75-P7535_2162223:367-nf] meant not[fn-75-P7536_2162301:368-nf] that the service[fn-75-P7537_2162335:369-nf] of these gifts should be in the body,[fn-75-P7538_2162389:370-nf] nor did He place them in the human body); and on the subject of the superiority of love[fn-75-P7539_2162534:371-nf] above all these gifts, He even taught the apostle that it was the chief commandment,[fn-75-P7540_2162653:372-nf] just as Christ has shown it to be: \"Thou shalt love the Lord with all thine heart and soul,[fn-75-P7541_2162788:373-nf] with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thine own self.\"[fn-75-P7542_2162898:374-nf] When he mentions the fact that \"it is written in the law,\"[fn-75-P7543_2162976:375-nf] how that the Creator would speak with other tongues and other lips, whilst confirming indeed the gift of tongues by such a mention, he yet cannot be thought to have affirmed that the gift was that of another god by his reference to the Creator's prediction.[fn-75-P7544_2163475:376-nf] In precisely the same manner,[fn-75-P7545_2163528:377-nf] when enjoining on women silence in the church, that they speak not for the mere sake[fn-75-P7546_2163627:378-nf] of learning[fn-75-P7547_2163663:379-nf] (although that even they have the right of prophesying, he has already shown[fn-75-P7548_2163767:380-nf] when he covers the woman that prophesies with a veil), he goes to the law for his sanction that woman should be under obedience.[fn-75-P7549_2163940:381-nf] Now this law, let me say once for all, he ought to have made no other acquaintance with, than to destroy it. But that we may now leave the subject of spiritual gifts, facts themselves will be enough to prove which of us acts rashly in claiming them for his God, and whether it is possible that they are opposed to our side, even if[fn-75-P7550_2164330:382-nf] the Creator promised them for His Christ who is not yet revealed, as being destined only for the Jews, to have their operations in His time, in His Christ, and among His people. Let Marcion then exhibit, as gifts of his god, some prophets, such as have not spoken by human sense, but with the Spirit of God, such as have both predicted things to come, and have made manifest[fn-75-P7551_2164765:383-nf] the secrets of the heart;[fn-75-P7552_2164811:384-nf] let him produce a psalm, a vision, a prayer[fn-75-P7553_2164878:385-nf] -only let it be by the Spirit,[fn-75-P7554_2164932:386-nf] in an ecstasy, that is, in a rapture,[fn-75-P7555_2165230:387-nf] whenever an interpretation of tongues has occurred to him; let him show to me also, that any woman of boastful tongue[fn-75-P7556_2165364:388-nf] in his community has ever prophesied from amongst those specially holy sisters of his. Now all these signs (of spiritual gifts) are forthcoming from my side without any difficulty, and they agree, too, with the rules, and the dispensations, and the instructions of the Creator; therefore without doubt the Christ, and the Spirit, and the apostle, belong severally[fn-75-P7557_2165747:389-nf] to my God. Here, then, is my frank avowal for any one who cares to require it.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":16,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_32_book_xix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"8. Christ also fulfilled the prophecies, because the promises of God were made good in Him. As the apostle says in the verse quoted above, \"The promises of God are in Him yea.\" Again, he says: \"Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers.\"[fn-18-P1837_1033216:19-nf] Whatever, then, was promised in the prophets, whether expressly or in figure, whether by words or by actions, was fulfilled in Him who came not to destroy the law and the prophets, but to fulfill them. You do not perceive that if Christians were to continue in the use of acts and observances by which things to come were prefigured, the only meaning would be that the things prefigured had not yet come. Either the thing prefigured has not come, or if it has, the figure becomes superfluous or misleading. Therefore, if Christians do not practise some things enjoined in the Hebrews by the prophets, this, so far from showing, as you think, that Christ did not fulfill the prophets, rather shows that He did. So completely did Christ fulfill what these types prefigured, that it is no longer prefigured. So the Lord Himself says: \"The law and the prophets were until John.\"[fn-18-P1838_1034108:20-nf] For the law which shut up transgressors in increased guilt, and to the faith which was afterwards revealed, became grace through Jesus Christ, by whom grace superabounded. Thus the law, which was not fulfilled in the requirement of the letter, was fulfilled in the liberty of grace. In the same way, everything in the law that was prophetic of the Saviour's advent, whether in words or in typical actions, became truth in Jesus Christ. For \"the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.\"[fn-18-P1839_1034639:21-nf] At Christ's advent the kingdom of God began to be preached; for the law and the prophets were until John: the law, that its transgressors might desire salvation; the prophets, that they might foretell the Saviour. No doubt there have been prophets in the Church since the ascension of Christ. Of these prophets Paul says: \"God hath set some in the Church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers,\" and so on.[fn-18-P1840_1035080:22-nf] It is not of these prophets that it was said, \"The law and the prophets were until John,\" but of those who prophesied the first coming of Christ, which evidently cannot be prophesied now that it has taken place.","title":"Book XIX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":16,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_32_book_ii_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"44","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Now with regard to the point, which with perfect propriety and great soundness of view he believes, that souls after quitting the body are judged, before they come to that final judgment to which they must submit when their bodies are restored to them, and are either tormented or glorified in the very same flesh wherein they once lived here on earth; is it, let me ask you, the case that you were really ignorant of this?

Now the followers of Origen bring forward this passage, \"For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved,\"[fn-58-P5888_1788594:88-nf] and so forth, to disprove the resurrection of the body, saying that the \"tabernacle\" is the body, and the \"house not made with hands\" \"in the heavens\" is our spiritual clothing. Therefore, says the holy Methodius, by this earthly house must metaphorically[fn-58-P5889_1788868:89-nf] be understood our short-lived existence here, and not this tabernacle; for if you decide to consider the body as being the earthly house which is dissolved, tell us what is the tabernacle whose house is dissolved? For the tabernacle is one thing, and the house of the tabernacle another, and still another we who have the tabernacle. \"For,\" he says, \"if our earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved\"-by which he points out that the souls are ourselves, that the body is a tabernacle, and that the house of the tabernacle figuratively represents the enjoyment of the flesh in the present life. If, then, this present life of the body be dissolved like a house, we shall have that which is not made with hands in the heavens. \"Not made with hands,\" he says, to point out the difference; because this life may be said to be made with hands, seeing that all the employments and pursuits of life are carried on by the hands of men. For the body, being the workmanship of God, is not said to be made with hands, inasmuch as it is not formed by the arts of men. But if they shall say that it is made with hands, because it was the workmanship of God, then our souls also, and the angels, and the spiritual clothing in the heavens, are made with hands; for all these things, also, are the workmanship of God. What, then, is the house which is made with hands? It is, as I have said, the short-lived existence which is sustained by human hands. For God said, \"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread; \"[fn-58-P5890_1790511:90-nf] and when that life is dissolved, we have the life which is not made with hands. As also the Lord showed, when He said: \"Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.\"[fn-58-P5891_1790783:91-nf] For what the Lord then called \"habitations,\"[fn-58-P5892_1790846:92-nf] the apostle here calls \"clothing.\"[fn-58-P5893_1790895:93-nf] And what He there calls \"friends\" \"of unrighteousness,\" the apostle here calls \"houses\" \"dissolved.\" As then, when the days of our present life shall fail, those good deeds of beneficence to which we have attained in this unrighteous life, and in this \"world\" which \"lieth in wickedness,\"[fn-58-P5894_1791221:94-nf] will receive our souls; so when this perishable life shall be dissolved, we shall have the habitation which is before the resurrection-that is, our souls shall he with God, until we shall receive the new house which is prepared for us, and which shall never fall. Whence also \"we groan,\" \"not for that we would be unclothed,\" as to the body, \"but clothed upon\"[fn-58-P5895_1791601:95-nf] by it in the other life. For the \"house in heaven,\" with which we desire to be \"clothed,\" is immortality; with which, when we are clothed, every weakness and mortality will be entirely \"swallowed up\" in it, being consumed by endless life. \"For we walk by faith, not by sight; \"[fn-58-P5896_1791897:96-nf] that is, for we still go forward by faith, viewing the things which are beyond with a darkened understanding, and not clearly, so that we may see these things, and enjoy them, and be in them. \"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.\"[fn-58-P5897_1792237:97-nf] By flesh, he did not mean flesh itself, but the irrational impulse towards the lascivious pleasures of the soul. And therefore when he says, \"Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God,\" he adds the explanation, \"Neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.\" Now corruption is not the thing which is corrupted, but the thing which corrupts. For when death prevails the body sinks into corruption; but when life still remains in it, it stands uncorrupted. Therefore, since the flesh is the boundary between corruption and incorruption, not being either corruption or incorruption, it was vanquished by corruption on account of pleasure, although it was the work and the possession of incorruption. Therefore it became subject to corruption. When, then, it had been overcome by corruption, and was given over to death for chastisement, He did not leave it to be vanquished and given over as an inheritance to corruption; but again conquering death by the resurrection, He restored it to incorruption, that corruption might not inherit incorruption, but incorruption that which is corruptible. And therefore the apostle answers, \"This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal immortality.\"[fn-58-P5898_1793465:98-nf] But the corruptible and mortal putting on incorruption and immortality, what else is this, but that which is sown in corruption rising in incorruption?[fn-58-P5899_1793637:99-nf] For, \"as we have borne the image of the earthly, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.\"[fn-59-P5900_1793754:100-nf] For the \"image of the earthly\" which we have borne refers to the saying, \"Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return.\"[fn-59-P5901_1793899:101-nf] And the \"image of the heavenly is the resurrection from the dead and incorruption.\"","title":"From the Discourse on the Resurrection.","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":16,"verse":28,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_122_from_the_discourse_on_the_resurrection_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"62","folder":"ANF-06","text":"XIX. He says that Origen holds these opinions which he refutes. And there may be a doubt concerning Lazarus and the rich man. The simpler persons think that these things were spoken as though both were receiving their due for the things which they had done in life in their bodies; but the more accurate think that, since no one is left in life after the resurrection, these things do not happen at the resurrection. For the rich man says: \"I have five brethren; ... lest they also come into this place of torment, \"[fn-59-P5929_1807173:114-nf] send Lazarus, that he may tell them of those things which are here. And, therefore, if we ask respecting the \"tongue,\" and the \"finger,\" and \"Abraham's bosom,\" and the reclining there, it may perhaps be that the soul receives in the change a form similar in appearance to its gross and earthly body. If, then, any one of those who have fallen asleep is recorded as having appeared, in the same way he has been seen in the form which he had when he was in the flesh. Besides, when Samuel appeared, it is clear that, being seen, he was clothed in a body;[fn-59-P5930_1807747:115-nf] and this must especially be admitted, if we are pressed by arguments which prove that the essence of the soul is incorporeal, and is manifested by itself.[fn-59-P5931_1807972:116-nf] But the rich man in torment, and the poor man who was comforted in the bosom of Abraham, are said, the one to be punished in Hades, and the other to be comforted in Abraham's bosom, before the appearing of the Saviour, and before the end of the world, and therefore before the resurrection; teaching that now already, at the change, the soul rises a body. Wherefore, the saint says as follows: Setting forth that the soul, after its removal hence, has a form similar in appearance to this sensitive body; does Origen represent the soul, after Plato, as being incorporeal? And how should that which, after removal from the world, is said to have need of a vehicle and a clothing, so that it might not be found naked, be in itself other than incorporeal? But if it be incorporeal, must it not also be incapable of passion? For it follows, from its being incorporeal, that it is also impassible and imperturbable. If, then, it was not distracted by any irrational desire, neither was it changed by a pained or suffering body. For neither can that which is incorporeal sympathize with a body, nor a body with that which is incorporeal, if,[fn-59-P5932_1809174:117-nf] indeed, the soul should seem to be incorporeal, in accordance with what has been said. But if it sympathize with the body, as is proved by the testimony of those who appear, it cannot be incorporeal. Therefore God alone is celebrated, as the unbegotten, independent, and unwearied nature; being incorporeal, and therefore invisible; for \"no man hath seen God.\"[fn-59-P5933_1809558:118-nf] But souls, being rational bodies, are arranged by the Maker and Father of all things into members which are visible to reason, having received this impression. Whence, also, in Hades, as in the case of Lazarus and the rich man, they are spoken of as having a tongue, and a finger, and the other members; not as though they had with them another invisible body, but that the souls themselves, naturally, when entirely stripped of their covering, are such according to their essence.","title":"From the Discourse on the Resurrection.","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":16,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_34_book_iv_","source_chapter":23,"source_paragraph":"89","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But you say: \"If the soul is incorporeal, what was it that the rich man saw in hell?

For what can this fate be, considered in itself, if nature be the first cause of all things? Or what shall we suppose nature itself to be, if the law of fate be inviolable? Indeed, the very assertion that there is a law of fate implies that such law is the work of a legislator: if, therefore, fate itself be a law, it must be a law devised by God. All things, therefore, are subject to God, and nothing is beyond the sphere of his power. If it be said that fate is the will[fn-81-P8164_3346715:26-nf] of God, and is so considered, we admit the fact. But in what respect do justice,[fn-81-P8165_3346814:27-nf] or self-control,[fn-81-P8166_3347406:28-nf] or the other virtues, depend on fate? From whence, if so, do their contraries, as injustice and intemperance, proceed? For vice has its origin from nature, not from fate; and virtue is the due regulation of natural character and disposition. But, granting that the varied results of actions, whether right or erroneous in themselves, depend on fortune or fate: in what sense can the general principle of justice,[fn-81-P8167_3348172:29-nf] the principle of rendering to every one his due, be ascribed to fate?[fn-81-P8168_3348275:30-nf] Or how can it be said that laws, encouragements to virtue and dissuasives from what is evil, praise, blame, punishment, in short whatever operates as a motive to virtue, and deters from the practice of vice, derive their origin from fortune or accident, and not rather from that of justice,[fn-81-P8169_3349183:31-nf] which is a characteristic attribute of the God of providence? For the events which befall men are consequent upon the tenor of their lives. Hence pestilence or sedition, famine and plenty, succeed in turn, declaring plainly and emphatically that all these things are regulated with reference to our course of life. For the Divine Being delights in goodness, but turns with aversion from all impiety; looks with acceptance on the humble spirit, but abhors presumption, and that pride which exalts itself above what becomes a creature. And though the proofs of these truths are clear and manifest to our sight, they appear in a still stronger light, when we collect, and as it were concentrate our thoughts within ourselves, and ponder their causes with deep attention. I say, then, that it becomes us to lead a life of modesty and gentleness, not suffering our thoughts to rise proudly above our natural condition, and ever mindful that God is near us, and is the observer of all our actions. But let us still farther test the truth of the proposition, that the order of the universe depends on chance[fn-81-P8170_3350301:32-nf] or accident.[fn-81-P8171_3350325:33-nf] Are we then to suppose that the stars and other heavenly bodies, the earth and sea, fire and wind, water and air, the succession of the seasons, the recurrence of summer and winter, that all these have an undesigned and fortuitous existence, and not rather that they proceed from the creative hand of God? Some, indeed, are so senseless as to say that most of these things have been devised by mankind because of their need of them. Let it be admitted that this opinion has a semblance of reason in regard to earthly and corruptible things (though Nature herself supplies every good with a lavish hand); yet can we believe that things which are immortal and unchangeable are the inventions of men? These, indeed, and all things else which are beyond the reach of our senses, and comprehended by the intellect[fn-81-P8172_3351150:34-nf] alone, receive their being, not from the material life of man, but from the intellectual and eternal essence of God. Again, the orderly arrangement of these things is the work of his providence: for instance, that the day, deriving radiance from the sun, is bright; that night succeeds his setting, and the starry host[fn-81-P8173_3351718:35-nf] by which night itself is redeemed from total darkness. And what shall we say of the moon, which when most distant from, and opposite to the sun, is filled with light, but wanes in proportion to the nearness of her approach to him? Do not these things manifestly evince the intelligence[fn-81-P8174_3352037:36-nf] and sagacious wisdom of God? Add to this that needful warmth of the solar rays which ripens the fruits of the earth; the currents of wind, so conducive to the fertility of the seasons; the cool and refreshing showers; and the harmony of all these things in accordance with which all are reasonably and systematically conducted: lastly, the everlasting order of the planets, which return to the self-same place at their appointed times: are not all these, as well as the perfect ministry of the stars, obedient to a divine law, evident proofs of the ordinance[fn-81-P8175_3352723:37-nf] of God? Again, do the mountain heights, the deep and hollow valleys, the level and extensive plains, useful as they are, as well as pleasing to the eye, appear to exist independently of the will of God? Or do not the proportion and alternate succession of land and water, serviceable, the one for husbandry, the other for the transport of such foreign products as we need, afford a clear demonstration of his exact and proportionate providential care? For instance, the mountains contain a store of water, which the level ground receives, and after imbibing sufficient for the renovation of the soil, sends forth the residue into the sea, and the sea in turn passes it onward to the ocean. And still we dare to say that all these things happen by chance[fn-81-P8176_3353508:38-nf] and accident; unable though we be to show by what shape or form this chance is characterized; a thing which has no foundation either in intellect or sense existence; which rings in our ears as the mere sound of an unsubstantial name!","title":"The Oration of the Emperor Constantine","author":"Eusebius Pamphilus"},{"chapter":16,"verse":27,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_34_homily_xxviii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"29","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"And from many other things too one might perceive, that it is not possible for a disembodied soul to remain here.

And still more weighty is it that the Saviour said to those who considered John to be a prophet,[fn-67-P6768_1221049:54-nf] \"But what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.\" The words, Yea, I say unto you, manifestly affirm that John is a prophet, and that is nowhere denied afterwards. If, then, he is said by the Saviour to be not only a prophet but \"more than a prophet,\" how is it that when the priests and levites come and ask him, \"Art thou the Prophet? \"he answers No! On this we must remark that it is not the same thing to say, \"Art thou the Prophet? \"and \"Art thou a prophet? \"The distinction between the two expressions has already been observed, when we asked what was the difference between the God and God, and between the Logos and Logos.[fn-67-P6769_1221735:55-nf] Now it is written in Deuteronomy,[fn-67-P6770_1221782:56-nf] \"A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, like me; Him shall ye hear, and it shall be that every soul that will not hear that prophet shall be cut off from among His people,\" There was, therefore, an expectation of one particular prophet having a resemblance to Moses in mediating between God and the people and receiving a new covenant from God to give to those who accepted his teaching; and in the case of each of the prophets, the people of Israel recognized that he was not the person of whom Moses spoke. As, then, they doubted about John, whether he were not the Christ,[fn-67-P6771_1222391:57-nf] so they doubted whether he could not be the prophet. And there is no wonder that those who doubted about John whether he were the Christ, did not understand that the Christ and the prophet are the same person; their doubt as to John necessarily implied that they were not clear on this point. Now the difference between \"the prophet\" and \"a prophet\" has escaped the observation of most students; this is the case with Heracleon, who says, in these very words: \"As, then, John confessed that he was not the Christ, and not even a prophet, nor Elijah.\" If he interpreted the words before us in such a way, he ought to have examined the various passages to see whether in saying that he is not a prophet nor Elijah he is or is not saying what is true. He devotes no attention, however, to these passages, and in his remaining commentaries he passes over such points without any enquiry.

Why, even shopkeepers who are particularly frugal, and slaves who are not wasteful, and the care-takers who made our childhood a burden to us and even thieves when they are particularly clever, we speak of as diligent; and so the conduct of the unjust steward in the Gospel is spoken of as wise.

And I was grieved that, although that pool held water, still, on account of the height to its brink, he could not drink. And I was aroused, and knew that my brother was in suffering. But I trusted that my prayer would bring help to his suffering; and I prayed for him every day until we passed over into the prison of the camp, for we were to fight in the camp-show.

If our spirit is aroused by the loss of property, it is commonished by the Lord's Scriptures, in almost every place, to a contemning of the world;[fn-122-P12284_3435965:71-nf] nor is there any more powerful exhortation to contempt of money submitted[fn-122-P12285_3436053:72-nf] (to us), than (the fact) the Lord Himself is found amid no riches. He always justifies the poor, fore-condemns the rich. So He fore-ministered to patience \"loss,\" and to opulence \"contempt\" (as portion);[fn-122-P12286_3436272:73-nf] demonstrating, by means of (His own) repudiation of riches, that hurts done to them also are not to be much regarded. Of that, therefore, which we have not the smallest need to seek after, because the Lord did not seek after it either, we ought to endure without heart-sickness the cutting down or taking away. \"Covetousness,\" the Spirit of the Lord has through the apostle pronounced \"a root of all evils.\"[fn-122-P12287_3436829:74-nf] Let us not interpret that covetousness as consisting merely in the concupiscence of what is another's: for even what seems ours is another's; for nothing is ours, since all things are God's, whose are we also ourselves. And so, if, when suffering from a loss, we feel impatiently, grieving for what is lost from what is not our own, we shall be detected as bordering on covetousness: we seek what is another's when we ill brook losing what is another's. He who is greatly stirred with impatience of a loss, does, by giving things earthly the precedence over things heavenly, sin directly[fn-122-P12288_3437463:75-nf] against God; for the Spirit, which he has received from the Lord, he greatly shocks for the sake of a worldly matter. Willingly, therefore, let us lose things earthly, let us keep things heavenly. Perish the whole world,[fn-122-P12289_3437775:76-nf] so I may make patience my gain! In truth, I know not whether he who has not made up his mind to endure with constancy the loss of somewhat of his, either by theft, or else by force, or else even by carelessness, would himself readily or heartily lay hand on his own property in the cause of almsgiving: for who that endures not at all to be cut by another, himself draws the sword on his own body? Patience in losses is an exercise in bestowing and communicating. Who fears not to lose, finds it not irksome to give. Else how will one, when he has two coats, give the one of them to the naked,[fn-122-P12290_3438384:77-nf] unless he be a man likewise to offer to one who takes away his coat his cloak as well?[fn-122-P12291_3438490:78-nf] How shall we fashion to us friends from mammon,[fn-122-P12292_3438569:79-nf] if we love it so much as not to put up with its loss? We shall perish together with the lost mammon. Why do we find here, where it is our business to lose?[fn-122-P12293_3438743:80-nf] To exhibit impatience at all losses is the Gentiles' business, who give money the precedence perhaps over their soul; for so they do, when, in their cupidities of lucre, they encounter the gainful perils of commerce on the sea; when, for money's sake, even in the forum, there is nothing which damnation (itself) would fear which they hesitate to essay; when they hire themselves for sport and the camp; when, after the manner of wild beasts, they play the bandit along the highway. But us, according to the diversity by which we are distinguished from them, it becomes to lay down not our soul for money, but money for our soul, whether spontaneously in bestowing or patiently in losing.","title":"Of Patience.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":16,"verse":28,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_59_book_ii","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"189","folder":"ANF-01","text":"4.

The altar of burnt-offering also was five cubits in breadth.[fn-70-P7093_1833748:197-nf] Five priests were chosen in the wilderness,-namely, Aaron,[fn-70-P7094_1833885:198-nf] Nadab, Abiud, Eleazar, Ithamar. The ephod and the breastplate, and other sacerdotal vestments, were formed out of five[fn-70-P7095_1834026:199-nf] materials; for they combined in themselves gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen.

And the man who is in this condition, cannot praise the Lord, according to the saying of the prophet which tells us: \"The dead cannot praise Thee, O Lord; neither all they that go down into the grave (doubtless of sin). But we,\" says he, \"who live(not forsooth to sin nor I to this world but to God) will bless the Lord, from this time forth for evermore: for in death no man remembereth God: but in the grave (of sin) who will confess to the Lord?\"[fn-35-P3555_1326588:27-nf] i.e., no one will.

He is not the God of the dead but of the living: for all do live unto Him.\"[fn-35-P3560_1327951:32-nf] Of whom also the Apostle says: \"wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for He hath prepared for them a city.\"[fn-35-P3561_1328103:33-nf] For that they are not idle after the separation from this body, and are not incapable of feeling, the parable in the gospel shows, which tells us of the beggar Lazarus and Dives clothed in purple, one of whom obtained a position of bliss, i.e., Abraham's bosom, the other is consumed with the dreadful heat of eternal fire.[fn-35-P3562_1328445:34-nf] But if you care too to understand the words spoken to the thief \"To-day thou shalt be with Me in Paradise,\"[fn-35-P3563_1328582:35-nf] what do they clearly show but that not only does their former intelligence continue with the souls, but also that in their changed condition they partake of some state which corresponds to their actions and deserts? For the Lord would certainly never have promised him this, if He had known that his soul after being separated from the flesh would either have been deprived of perception or have been resolved into nothing. For it was not his flesh but his soul which was to enter Paradise with Christ. At least we must avoid, and shunwith the utmost horror, that wicked punctuation of the heretics, who, as they do not believe that Christ could be found in Paradise on the same day on which He descended into hell, thus punctuate \"Verily, I say unto you to-day,\" and making a stop apply \"thou shall be with. Me in Paradise, in such a way that they imagine that this promise was not fulfilled at once after he departed from this life, but that it will be fulfilled after the resurrection,[fn-35-P3564_1329596:36-nf] as they do not understand what before the time of His resurrection He declared to the Jews, who fancied that He was hampered by human difficulties and weakness of the flesh as they were: \"No man hath ascended into heaven, but He who came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven:\"[fn-35-P3565_1330070:37-nf] by which He clearly shows that the souls of the departed are not only not deprived of their reason, but that they are not even without such feelings as hope and sorrow, joy and fear, and that they already are beginning to taste beforehand something of what is reserved for them at the last judgment, and that they are not as some unbelievers hold resolved into nothing after their departure from this life:[fn-35-P3566_1330499:38-nf] but that they live a more real life, and are still more earnest in waiting on the praises of God. And indeed to put aside for a little Scripture proofs, and to discuss, as far as our ability permits us, a little about the nature of the soul itself, is it not beyond the bounds of I will not say the folly, but the madness of all stupidity, even to have the slightest suspicion that the nobler part of man, in which as the blessed Apostle shows, the image and likeness of God consists,[fn-35-P3567_1331546:39-nf] will, when the burden of the body with which it is oppressed in this world is laid aside, become insensible, when, as it contains in itself all the power of reason, it makes the dumb and senseless material flesh sensible, by participation with it: especially when it follows, and the order of reason itself demands that when the mind has put off the grossness of the flesh with which it is now weighed down, it will restore its intellectual powers better than ever, and receive them in a purer and finer condition than it lost them. But so far did the blessed Apostle recognize that what we say is true, that he actually wished to depart from this flesh; that by separation from it, he might be able to be joined more earnestly to the Lord; saying: \"I desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, which is far better, for while we are in the body we are absent from the Lord:\" and therefore \"we are bold and have our desire always to be absent from the body, and present with the Lord. Wherefore also we strive, whether absent or present, to be pleasing to Him;\"[fn-35-P3568_1332647:40-nf] and he declares indeed that the continuance of the soul which is in the flesh is distance from the Lord, and absence from Christ, and trusts with entire faith that its separation and departure from this flesh involves presence with Christ. And again still more clearly the same Apostle speaks of this state of the souls as one that is very full of life: \"But ye are come to Mount Sion, and the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, and the church of the first born, who are written in heaven, and the spirits of just men made perfect.\"[fn-35-P3569_1333265:41-nf] Of which spirits he speaks in another passage, \"Furthermore we have had instructors of our flesh, and we reverenced them: shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live?\"[fn-35-P3570_1333480:42-nf] ","title":"I.

If then you will listen to me, you will bid a long farewell to all such arguments, and you will jump at this Blessing, and begin to struggle in a twofold conflict; first, to prepare yourself for baptism by purifying yourself; and next, to preserve the baptismal gift; for it is a matter of equal difficulty to obtain a blessing which we have not, and to keep it when we have gained it. For often what zeal has acquired sloth has destroyed; and what hesitation has lost diligence has regained. A great assistance to the attainment of what you desire are vigils, fasts, sleeping on the ground, prayers, tears, pity of and almsgiving to those who are in need. And let these be your thanksgiving for what you have received, and at the same time your safeguard of them. You have the benefit to remind you of many commandments; so do not transgress them.

One in want of bread or of drink, perhaps another Lazarus,[fn-52-P5223_1741599:96-nf] is cast at your gate; respect the Sacramental Table to which you have approached, the Bread of Which you have partaken, the Cup in Which you have communicated,[fn-52-P5224_1741781:97-nf] being consecrated by the Sufferings of Christ.

For as I said nothing is our own, save this only which we possess with our heart, and which cleaves to our soul, and therefore cannot be taken away from us by any one. But Christ speaks in terms of censure of those visible riches, to those who clutch them as if they were their own, and refuse to share them with those in want. \"If ye have not been faithful in what is another's, who will give to you what is your own?\"[fn-38-P3872_1441466:42-nf] Plainly then it is not only daily experience which teaches us that these riches are not our own, but this saying of our Lord also, by the very title which it gives them. But concerning visible[fn-38-P3873_1441682:43-nf] and worthless riches Peter says to the Lord: \"Lo, we have left all and followed thee. What shall we have therefore?\"[fn-38-P3874_1441857:44-nf] when it is clear that they had left nothing but their miserable broken nets. And unless this expression \"all\" is understood to refer to that renunciation of sins which is really great and important, we shall not find that the Apostles had left anything of any value, or that the Lord had any reason for bestowing on them the blessing of so great glory, that they were allowed to hear from Him that \"in the regeneration, when the Son of Man shall sit on the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.\"[fn-38-P3875_1442434:45-nf] If then those, who have completely renounced their earthly and visible goods, cannot for sufficient reason attain to Apostolic charity, nor climb with readiness and vigour to that third stage of renunciation which is still higher and belongs to but few, what should those think of themselves, who do not even make that first step (which is very easy) a thorough one, but keep together with their old want of faith, their former sordid riches, and fancy that they can boast of the mere name of monks? The first renunciation then of which we spoke is of what is not our own, and therefore is not enough of itself to confer perfection on the renunciant, unless he advances to the second, which is really and truly a renunciation of what belongs to us. And when we have made sure of this by the expulsion of all our faults, we shall mount to the heights of the third renunciation also, whereby we rise above not merely all those things which are done in this world or specially belong to men, but even that whole universe around us which is esteemed so glorious, and shall with heart and soul look down upon it as subject to vanity and destined soon to pass away; as we look, as the Apostle says, \"not on those things which are seen, but on those which are not seen: for the things that are seen, are temporal, and the things which are not seen are eternal;\"[fn-38-P3876_1443807:46-nf] that so we may be found worthy to hear that highest utterance, which was spoken to Abraham: \"and come into a land which I will show thee,\"[fn-38-P3877_1443966:47-nf] which clearly shows that unless a man has made those three former renunciations with all earnestness of mind, he cannot attain to this fourth, which is granted as a reward and privilege to one whose renunciation is perfect, that he may be found worthy to enter the land of promise which no longer bears for him the thorns and thistles of sins; which after all the passions have been driven out is acquired by purity of heart even in the body, and whichno good deeds or exertions of man's efforts (can gain), but which the Lord Himself promises to show, saying \"And come into the land which I will show to thee:\" which clearly proves that the beginning of our salvation results from the call of the Lord, Who says \"Get thee out from thy country,\" and that the completion of perfection and purity is His gift in the same way, as He says \"And come into the land which I will show thee,\" i.e., not one you yourself can know or discover by your own efforts, but one which I will show not only to one who is ignorant of it, but even to one who is not looking for it. And from this we clearly gather that as we hasten to the way of salvation through being stirred up by the inspiration of the Lord, so too it is under the guidance of His direction and illumination that we attain to the perfection of the highest bliss.","title":"III.

And I beg you to direct your attention specially to this point, that some of them may be skilled in making vaulting[fn-43-P4371_2857659:6-nf] without supports: for I am informed that when built in this way it is more durable than what is made to rest on props. It is the scarcity of wood that brings us to this device of roofing the whole fabric with stone; because the place supplies no timber for roofing. Let your unerring mind be persuaded, because some of the people here contract with me to furnish thirty workmen for a stater, for the dressed stonework, of course with a specified ration along with the stater. But the material of our masonry is not of this sort[fn-43-P4372_2858207:7-nf] , but brick made of clay and chance stones, so that they do not need to spend time in fitting the faces of the stones accurately together. I know that so far as skill and fairness in the matter of wages are concerned, the workmen in your neighbourhood are better for our purpose than those who follow the trade here.

The porch, too, will be of marbles wrought with appropriate ornaments. The doors set upon these will be adorned with some such designs as are usually employed by way of embellishment at the projection of the cornice. Of all these, of course, we shall furnish the materials; the form to be impressed on the materials art will bestow.

I know that we shall appear to most people to be higglers, in being so particular about the contracts.

This is why I make a point of the fairness of the workmen, to the end that we may be able to fulfil the task before us, and not be hindered by poverty-that laudable and desirable evil. Well, in all this there is a certain admixture of jest. But do you, man of God, in such ways as are possible and legitimate, boldly promise in bargaining with the men that they will all meet with fair treatment at our hands, and full payment of their wages: for we shall give all and keep back nothing, as God also opens to us, by your prayers, His hand of blessing.

And being present at His judicial decision, all, both men and angels and demons, shall utter one voice, saying, \"Righteous is Thy judgment.\"[fn-37-P3706_1170148:204-nf] Of which voice the justification will be seen in the awarding to each that which is just; since to those who have done well shall be assigned righteously eternal bliss, and to the lovers of iniquity shall be given eternal punishment. And the fire which is un-quenchable and without end awaits these latter, and a certain fiery worm which dieth not, and which does not waste the body, but continues bursting forth from the body with unending pain. No sleep will give them rest; no night will soothe them; no death will deliver them from punishment; no voice of interceding friends will profit them.[fn-37-P3707_1170769:205-nf] For neither are the righteous seen by them any longer, nor are they worthy of remembrance. But the righteous will remember only the righteous deeds by which they reached the heavenly kingdom, in which there is neither sleep, nor pain, nor corruption, nor care,[fn-37-P3708_1171344:206-nf] nor night, nor day measured by time; nor sun traversing in necessary course the circle of heaven, which marks the limits of seasons, or the points measured out for the life of man so easily read; nor moon waning or waxing, or inducing the changes of seasons, or moistening the earth; no burning sun, no changeful Bear, no Orion coming forth, no numerous wandering of stars, no painfully-trodden earth, no abode of paradise hard to find; no furious roaring of the sea, forbidding one to touch or traverse it; but this too will be readily passable for the righteous, although it lacks no water. There will be no heaven inaccessible to men, nor will the way of its ascent be one impossible to find; and there will be no earth unwrought, or toilsome for men, but one producing fruit spontaneously in beauty and order; nor will there be generation of wild beasts again, nor the bursting[fn-37-P3709_1172281:207-nf] substance of other creatures. Neither with man will there be generation again, but the number of the righteous remains indefectible with the righteous angels and spirits. Ye who believe these words, O men, will be partakers with the righteous, and will have part in these future blessings, which \"eye hath not seen nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him.\"[fn-37-P3710_1172735:208-nf] To Him be the glory and the power, for ever and ever.

For all these things would have been buried and altogether driven out of your hearts, if you had got hold of the right method of renunciation, and the main reason for the solitude in which we dwell.

Nor are we so deprived of the solace of our kinsfolk, that those who delight to support us with their substance should fail us, were it not that this saying of the Saviour meets us and excludes everything that contributes to the support of this flesh, as He says: \"He who doth not leave (or hate) father and mother and children and brethren cannot be My disciple.\"[fn-66-P6684_2391975:6-nf] But if we were altogether deprived of the protection of our parents, the services of the princes of this world would not be wanting, as they would most thankfully rejoice to minister to our necessities with prompt liberality.

The beggar was taken into custody, so was the rich man: but the one into Abraham's bosom; the other, where he thirsted, and found not a drop of water.[fn-21-P2125_1314932:16-nf] ","title":"Tractate XLIX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":16,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_79_letter_x_for_338_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"6. We may take as a type of this distinction, the departure of the children of Israel and the Egyptians from Egypt. For the Egyptians, rejoicing a little while in their injustice against Israel, when they went forth, were all drowned in the deep; but the people of God, being fora time smitten and injured, by the conduct of the taskmasters, when they came out of Egypt, passed through the sea unharmed, and walked in the wilderness as an inhabited place. For although the place was unfrequented by man and desolate, yet, through the gracious gift of the law, and through converse with angels, it was no longer desert, but far more than an inhabited country. As also Elisha[fn-92-P9263_3363081:37-nf] , when he thought he was alone in the wilderness, was with companies of angels; so in this case, though the people were at first afflicted and in the wilderness, yet those who remained faithful afterwards entered the land of promise. In like manner those who suffer temporal afflictions here, finally having endured, attain comfort, while those who here persecute are trodden under foot, and have no good end. For even the rich man[fn-92-P9264_3363641:38-nf] , as the Gospel affirms, having indulged in pleasure here for a little while, suffered hunger there, and having drunk largely here, he there thirsted exceedingly. But Lazarus, after being afflicted in worldly things, found rest in heaven, and having hungered for bread ground from corn, he was there satisfied with that which is better than manna, even the Lord who came down and said, `I am the bread which came down from heaven, and giveth life to mankind[fn-92-P9265_3364118:39-nf] .'","title":"Letter X.

My brethren, I indeed am a disciple of Christ, and, moreover, an apostle of Jesus; and it is owing to the exceeding kindness of Marcellus that I have hastened hither, with the view of showing him clearly in what manner he ought to keep the system of divine religion, so that the said Marcellus verily, who at present has put himself, like one who has surrendered himself prisoner, under the doctrine of Archclaus, may not, like the dumb animals, which are destitute of intellect and understand not what they do, be fatally smitten to the ruin of his soul, in consequence of any failure in the possession of further facilities for setting about the right observance of divine worship. I know, furthermore, and am certain, that if Marcellus is once set right,[fn-33-P3347_874919:97-nf] it will be quite possible that all of you may also have your salvation effected; for your city hangs suspended upon his judgment. If vain presumption is rejected by every one of you, and if those things which are to be declared by me be heard with a real love for the truth, ye will receive the inheritance of the age to come, and the kingdom of heaven. I, in sooth, am the Paraclete, whose mission was announced of old time by Jesus, and who was to come to \"convince the world of sin and unrighteousness.\"[fn-33-P3348_875483:98-nf] And even as Paul, who was sent before me, said of himself, that \"he knew in part, and prophesied in part,\"[fn-33-P3349_875929:99-nf] so I reserve the perfect for myself, in order that I may do away with that which is in part. Therefore receive ye this third testimony, that I am an elect apostle of Christ; and if ye choose to accept my words, ye will find salvation; but if ye refuse them, eternal fire will have you to consume you. For as Hymenaeus and Alexander were\" delivered unto Satan, that they might learn not to blaspheme,\"[fn-33-P3350_876352:100-nf] so will all ye also be delivered unto the prince of punishments, because ye have done injury to the Father of Christ, in so far as ye declare Him to be the cause of all evils, and the founder of unrighteousness, and the creator of all iniquity. By such doctrine ye do, indeed, bring forth from the same fountain both sweet water and bitter,-a thing which can in no possible way be either done or apprehended. For who ought to be believed? Should it be those masters of yours whose enjoyment is in the flesh, and who pamper themselves with the richest delights; or our Saviour Jesus Christ, who says, as it is written in the book of the Gospels, \"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit,\"[fn-33-P3351_877114:101-nf] and who in another place assures us that the \"father of the devil[fn-33-P3352_877202:102-nf] is a liar and a murderer from the beginning,\"[fn-33-P3353_877271:103-nf] and tells us again that men's desire was for the darkness,[fn-33-P3354_877352:104-nf] so that they would not follow that Word that had been sent forth in the beginning from the light,[fn-33-P3355_877491:105-nf] and (once more shows us) the man who is the enemy of the same, the sower of tares,[fn-33-P3356_877871:106-nf] and the god and prince of the age of this world, who blinds the minds of men that they may not be obedient to the truth in the Gospel of Christ?[fn-33-P3357_878039:107-nf] Is that God good who has no wish that the men who are his own should be saved? And, not to go over a multitude of other matters, and waste much time, I may defer[fn-33-P3358_878235:108-nf] till another opportunity the exposition of the true doctrine; and taking it for granted that I have said enough on this subject for the present, I may revert to the matter immediately before me, and endeavour satisfactorily to demonstrate the absurdity of these men's teaching, and show that none of these things can be attributed to the God and Father of our Lord and Saviour, but that we must take Satan to be the cause of all our ills. To him, certainly, these must be carried back, for all ills of this kind are generated by him. But those things also which are written in the prophets and the law are none the less to be ascribed to him; for he it is who spake then in the prophets, introducing into their minds very many ignorant notions of God, as well as temptations and passions. They, too, set forth that devourer of blood and flesh; and to that Satan and to his prophets all these things properly pertain which he wished to transfer[fn-33-P3359_879243:109-nf] to the Father of Christ, prepared as he was to write a few things in the way of truth, that by means of these he might also gain credence for those other statements of his which are false. Hence it is well for us to receive nothing at all of all those things which have been written of old even down to John, and indeed to embrace only the kingdom of heaven, which has been preached in the Gospel since his days; for they verily but made a mockery of themselves, introducing as they did things ridiculous and ludicrous, keeping some small words given in obscure outline in the law, but not understanding that, if good things are mixed up with evil, the result is, that by the corruption of these evil things, even those others which are good are destroyed. And if, indeed, there is any one who may prove himself able to demonstrate that the law upholds the right, that law ought to be kept; but if we can show it to be evil, then it ought to be done away with and rejected, inasmuch as it contains the ministration of death, which was graven,[fn-33-P3360_880308:110-nf] which also covered and destroyed the glory on the countenance of Moses.[fn-33-P3361_880399:111-nf] It is a thing not without peril, therefore, for any one of you to teach the New Testament along with the law and the prophets, as if they were of one and the same origin; for the knowledge of our Saviour renews the one from day to day, while the other grows old and infirm, and passes almost into utter destruction.[fn-33-P3362_880737:112-nf] And this is a fact manifest to those who are capable of exercising discernment. For just as, when the branches of a tree become aged, or when the trunk ceases to bear fruit any more, they are cut down; and just as, when the members of the body suffer mortification, they are amputated, for the poison of the mortification diffuses itself from these members through the whole body, and unless some remedy be found for the disease by the skill of the physician, the whole body will be vitiated; so, too, if ye receive the law without understanding its origin, ye will ruin your souls, and lose your salvation. For \"the law and the prophets were until John; \"[fn-33-P3363_881420:113-nf] but since John the law of truth, the law of the promises, the law of heaven, the new law, is made known to the race of man. And, in sooth, as long as there was no one to exhibit to you this most true knowledge of our Lord Jesus, ye had not sin. Now, however, ye both see and hear, and yet ye desire to walk in ignorance,[fn-33-P3364_881762:114-nf] in order that ye may keep[fn-33-P3365_882007:115-nf] that law which has been destroyed and abandoned. And Paul, too, who is held to be the most approved apostle with us, expresses himself to the same effect in one of his epistles, when he says: \"For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a prevaricator.\"[fn-33-P3366_882339:116-nf] And in saying this he pronounces on them as Gentiles, because they were under the elements of the world,[fn-33-P3367_882507:117-nf] before the fulness of faith came, believing then as they did in the law and the prophets.","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":16,"verse":16,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"ANF-06","text":"40. I wish you to know, most pious father, that in these days there has arrived in our parts a certain person named Manes, who gives out that he is to complete the doctrine of the New Testament. And in the statements which he has made there have been some things, indeed, which may harmonize with our faith; but there have been also certain affirmations of his which seem very far removed from what has come down to us by the tradition of our fathers. For he has interpreted some doctrines in a strange fashion, imposing on them certain notions of his own, which have appeared to me to be altogether foreign and opposed to the faith. On the ground of these facts I have now been induced to write this letter to you, knowing the completeness and fulness of your intelligence in doctrine, and being assured that none of these things can escape your cognizance. Accordingly, I have also indulged the confident hope that you cannot be kept back by any grudge[fn-36-P3692_1033765:413-nf] from explaining these matters to us. As to myself, indeed, it is not possible that I shall be drawn away into any novel doctrine; nevertheless, in behalf of all the less instructed, I have been led to ask a word with your authority. For, in truth, the man shows himself to be a person of extraordinary force of character, both in speech and in action; and indeed his very aspect and attire also bear that out. But I shall here write down for your information some few points which I have been able to retain in my memory out of all the topics which have been expounded by him: for I know that even by these few you will have an idea of the rest. You well understand, no doubt, that those who seek to set up any new dogma have the habit of very readily perverting into a conformity with their own notions any proofs they desire to take from the Scriptures.[fn-36-P3693_1034637:414-nf] In anticipation, however, of this, the apostolic word marks out the case thus: \"If any one preach any other gospel unto you than that which you have received, let him be accursed.\"[fn-36-P3694_1034870:415-nf] And consequently, in addition to what has been once committed to us by the apostles, a disciple of Christ ought to receive nothing new as doctrine.[fn-36-P3695_1035037:416-nf] But not to make what I have got to say too long, I return to the subject directly in view. This man then maintained that the law of Moses, to speak shortly, does not proceed from the good God, but from the prince of evil; and that it has no kinship with the new law of Christ, but is contrary and hostile to it, the one being the direct antagonist of the other. When I heard such a sentiment propounded, I repeated to the people that sentence of the Gospel in which our Lord Jesus Christ said of Himself: \"I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil it.\"[fn-36-P3696_1035912:417-nf] The man, however, averred that He did not utter this saying at all; for he held that when we find that He did abrogate[fn-36-P3697_1036051:418-nf] that same law, we are bound to give heed, above all other considerations, to the thing which He actually did. Then he began to cite a great variety of passages from the law, and also many from the Gospel and from the Apostle Paul, which have the appearance of contradicting each other. All this he gave forth at the same time with perfect confidence, and without any hesitation or fear; so that I verily believe he has that serpent as his helper, who is ever our adversary. Well, he declared that there in the law God said, \"I make the rich man and the poor man; \"[fn-36-P3698_1036635:419-nf] while here in the Gospel Jesus called the poor blessed,[fn-36-P3699_1036713:420-nf] and added, that no man could be His disciple unless he gave up all that he had.[fn-37-P3700_1036812:421-nf] Again, he maintained that there Moses took silver and gold from the Egyptians when the people[fn-37-P3701_1036927:422-nf] fled out of Egypt;[fn-37-P3702_1037005:423-nf] whereas Jesus delivered the precept that we should lust after nothing belonging to our neighbour. Then he affirmed that Moses had provided in the law, that an eye should be given in penalty for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;[fn-37-P3703_1037252:424-nf] but that our Lord bade us offer the other cheek also to him who smote the one.[fn-37-P3704_1037351:425-nf] He told us, too, that there Moses commanded the man to be punished and stoned who did any work on the Sabbath, and who failed to continue in all things that were written in the law,[fn-37-P3705_1037553:426-nf] as in fact was done to that person who, yet being ignorant, had gathered a bundle of sticks on the Sabbath-day; whereas Jesus cured a cripple on the Sabbath, and ordered him then also to take up his bed.[fn-37-P3706_1037777:427-nf] And further, He did not restrain His disciples from plucking the ears of corn and rubbing them with their hands on the Sabbath-day,[fn-37-P3707_1037929:428-nf] which yet was a thing which it was unlawful to do on the Sabbaths. And why should I mention other instances? For with many different assertions of a similar nature these dogmas of his were propounded with the utmost energy and the most fervid zeal. Thus, too, on the authority of an apostle, he endeavoured to establish the position that the law of Moses is the law of death, and that the law of Jesus, on the contrary, is the law of life. For he based that assertion on the passage which runs thus: \"In which also may God make us[fn-37-P3708_1038479:429-nf] able ministers of the New Testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. But if the ministration of death, engraven in letters on the stones,[fn-37-P3709_1038695:430-nf] was made in glory, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away; how shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious? For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. For if that which shall be done away is glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.\"[fn-37-P3710_1039283:431-nf] And this passage, as you are also well aware, occurs in the second Epistle to the Corinthians. Besides, he added to this another passage out of the first epistle, on which he based his affirmation that the disciples of the Old Testament were earthly and natural; and in accordance with this, that flesh and blood could not possess the kingdom of God.[fn-37-P3711_1039659:432-nf] He also maintained that Paul himself spoke in his own proper person when he said: \"If I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.\"[fn-37-P3712_1039845:433-nf] Further, he averred that the same apostle made this statement most obviously on the subject of the resurrection of the flesh. when he also said that \"he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh,\"[fn-37-P3713_1040114:434-nf] and that according to the letter the law has in it no advantage.[fn-37-P3714_1040199:435-nf] And again he adduced the statement, that \"Abraham has glory, but not before God; \"[fn-37-P3715_1040301:436-nf] and that \"by the law there comes only the knowledge of sin.\"[fn-37-P3716_1040381:437-nf] And many other things did he introduce, with the view of detracting from the honour of the law, on the ground that the law itself is sin; by which statements the simpler people were somewhat influenced, as he continued to bring them forward; and in accordance with all this, he also made use of the affirmation, that \"the law and the prophets were until John.\"[fn-37-P3717_1040764:438-nf] He declared, however, that John preached the true kingdom of heaven; for verily he held, that by the cutting off of his head it was signified that all who went before him, and who had precedence over him, were to be cut off, and that what was to come after him was alone to be maintained. With reference to all these things, therefore, O most pious Archelaus, send us back a short reply in writing: for I have heard that you have studied such matters in no ordinary degree; and that capacity which you possess is God's gift, inasmuch as God bestows these gifts upon those who are worthy of them, and who are His friends, and who show themselves allied to Him in community of purpose and life. For it is our part to prepare ourselves, and to approach the gracious and liberal mind,[fn-37-P3718_1041566:439-nf] and forthwith we receive from it the most bountiful gifts. Accordingly, since the learning which I possess for the discussion of themes like these does not meet the requirements of my desire and purpose, for I confess myself to he an unlearned man, I have sent to you, as I have already said more than once, in the hope of obtaining from your hand the amplest solution to this question.

I have been given to understand, moreover, that this man, who made his way to me before these days, and sought to introduce a novel kind of knowledge here, different from what is apostolic and ecclesiastical, has also come to you. To that person, indeed, I gave no place: for presently, when we held a disputation together, he was confuted. And I could wish now to transcribe for your behoof all the arguments of which I made use on that occasion, so that by means of these you might get an idea of what that man's faith is. But as that could be done only with leisure at my disposal, I have deemed it requisite, in view of the immediate exigency, to write a short reply to you with reference to what you have written me on the subject of the statements advanced by him. I understand, then, that his chief[fn-37-P3722_1043809:441-nf] effort was directed to prove that the law of Moses is not consonant with the law of Christ; and this position he attempted to found on the authority of our Scriptures. Well, on the other hand, not only did we establish the law of Moses, and all things which are written in it, by the same Scripture; but we also proved that the whole Old Testament agrees with the New Testament, and is in perfect harmony with the same, and that they form really one texture, just as a person may see one and the same robe made up of weft and warp together.[fn-37-P3723_1044417:442-nf] For the truth is simply this, that just as we trace the purple in a robe, so, if we may thus express it, we can discern the New Testament in the texture of the Old Testament; for we see the glory of the Lord mirrored in the same.[fn-37-P3724_1044923:443-nf] We are not therefore to cast aside the mirror,[fn-37-P3725_1045151:444-nf] seeing that it shows us the genuine image of the things themselves, faithfully and truly; but, on the contrary, we ought to honour it all the more. Think you, indeed, that the boy who is brought by his paedagogue to the teachers of learning[fn-37-P3726_1045531:445-nf] when he is yet a very little fellow, ought to hold that paedagogue in no honour[fn-37-P3727_1045827:446-nf] after he has grown up to manhood, simply because he needs his services[fn-37-P3728_1045965:447-nf] no longer, but can make his course without any assistance from that attendant to the schools, and quickly find his way to the lecture-rooms? Or, to take another instance, would it be right for the child who has been nourished on milk at first, after he has grown to be capable of receiving stronger meats, then injuriously to spurn the breasts of his nurse, and conceive a horror of them? Nay, rather he should honour and cherish them, and confess himself a debtor to their good services. We may also make use, if it please you, of another illustration. A certain man on one occasion having noticed an infant exposed on the ground and already suffering excessively, picked it up, and undertook to rear it in his own house until it should reach the age of youth, and sustained all the toils and anxieties which are wont to fall to the lot of those who have to bring up children. After a time, however, it happened that he who was the child's natural father came seeking the boy, and found him with this person who had brought him up.[fn-37-P3729_1047088:448-nf] What ought this boy to do on learning that this is his real father? For I speak, of course, of a boy of the right type. Would he not see to it, that he who had brought him up should be recompensed with liberal gifts; and would he not then follow his natural father, having his proper inheritance in view?[fn-37-P3730_1047553:449-nf] Even so, then, I think we must suppose that that distinguished servant of God, Moses, in a manner something like this, found[fn-37-P3731_1047761:450-nf] a people afflicted by the Egyptians; and he took this people to himself, and nurtured them in the desert like a father, and instructed them like a teacher, and ruled them as a magistrate. This people he also preserved against the coming of him whose people they were. And after a considerable period the father[fn-37-P3732_1048134:451-nf] did come, and did receive, his sheep. Now will not that guardian be honoured in all things by him to whom he delivered that flock; and will he not be glorified by those who have been preserved by him? Who, then, can be so senseless, my dearly beloved Diodorus, as to say that those are aliens to each other who have been allied with each other, who have prophesied in turn for each other, and who have shown signs and wonders which are equal and similar, the one to the other, and of like nature with each other;[fn-37-P3733_1048702:452-nf] or rather, to speak in truth, which belong wholly to the same stock the one with the other? For, indeed, Moses first said to the people: \"A Prophet will the Lord our God raise up unto you, like unto me.\"[fn-37-P3734_1048972:453-nf] And Jesus afterwards said: \"For Moses spake of me.\"[fn-37-P3735_1049048:454-nf] You see[fn-37-P3736_1049075:455-nf] how these twain give the fight hand to each other, although[fn-37-P3737_1049222:456-nf] the one was the prophet and the other was the beloved Son,[fn-37-P3738_1049314:457-nf] and although in the one we are to recognise the faithful servant, but in the other the Lord Himself. Now, on the other hand, I might refer to the fact, that one who of old was minded to make his way to the schools without the paedagogue was not taken in by the master. For the master said: \"I will not receive him unless he accepts the paedagogue.\" And who the person is, who is spoken of under that figure, I shall briefly explain. There was a certain rich man,[fn-37-P3739_1049804:458-nf] who lived after the manner of the Gentiles, and passed his time in great luxury every day; and there was also another man, a poor man, who was his neighbour, and who was unable to procure even his daily bread. It happened that both these men departed this life, that they both descended into the grave,[fn-37-P3740_1050133:459-nf] and that the poor man was conveyed into the place of rest, and so forth, as is known to you. But, furthermore, that rich man had also five brothers, living as he too had lived, and disturbed by no doubt as to lessons which they had learned at home from such a master. The rich man then entreated that these should be instructed in the superior doctrine together and at once.[fn-37-P3741_1050552:460-nf] But Abraham, knowing that they still stood in need of the paedagogue, said to him: \"They have Moses and the prophets.\" For if they received not these, so as to have their course directed by him, i.e., Moses, as by a paedagogue, they would not be capable of accepting the doctrine of the superior master.","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":16,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_91_epistle_lxvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"ANF-05","text":"4. For what is a greater or a more worthy care of overseers, than to provide by diligent solicitude and wholesome medicine for cherishing and preserving the sheep? since the Lord speaks, and says, \"The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost. And my sheep were scattered because there is no shepherd; and they became meat to all the beasts of the field, and none did search or seek after them. Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I will require my flock at their hands, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall they feed them any more: for I will deliver them from their mouth, and I will feed them with judgment.\"[fn-60-P6096_1925222:7-nf] Since therefore the Lord thus threatens such shepherds by whom the Lord's sheep are neglected and perish, what else ought we to do, dearest brother, than to exhibit full diligence in gathering together and restoring the sheep of Christ, and to apply the medicine of paternal affection to cure the wounds of the lapsed, since the Lord also in the Gospel warns, and says, \"They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick? \"[fn-60-P6097_1925689:8-nf] For although we are many shepherds, yet we feed one flock,[fn-60-P6098_1925765:9-nf] and ought to collect and cherish all the sheep which Christ by His blood and passion sought for; nor ought we to suffer our suppliant and mourning brethren to be cruelly despised and trodden down by the haughty presumption of some, since it is written, \"But the man that is proud and boastful shall bring nothing at all to perfection, who has enlarged his soul as hell.\"[fn-60-P6099_1926252:10-nf] And the Lord, in His Gospel, blames and condemns men of that kind, saying, \"Ye are they which justify yourselves before men, but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight Of God.\"[fn-61-P6100_1926504:11-nf] He says that those are execrable and detestable who please themselves, who, swelling and inflated, arrogantly assume anything to themselves. Since then Marcian has begun to be of these, and, allying himself with Novatian, has stood forth as the opponent of mercy and love, let him not pronounce sentence, but receive it; and let him not so act as if he himself were to judge of the college of priests, since he himself is judged by all the priests.","title":"Epistle LXVI.","author":"Cyprian"},{"chapter":16,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_97_epistle_lxxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"24","folder":"ANF-05","text":"19. But if Christ's disciples are unwilling to learn from Christ what veneration and honour is due to the name of the Father, still let them learn from earthly and secular examples, and know that Christ has declared, not without the strongest rebuke, \"The children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light.\"[fn-63-P6316_2009880:28-nf] In this world of ours, if any one have offered an insult to the father of any; if in injury and frowardness he have wounded his reputation and his honour by a malevolent tongue, the son is indignant, and wrathful, and with what means he can, strives to avenge his injured father's wrong. Think you that Christ grants impunity to the impious and profane, and the blasphemers of His Father, and that He puts away their sins in baptism, who it is evident, when baptized, still heap up evil words on the person of the Father, and sin with the unceasing wickedness of a blaspheming tongue? Can a Christian, can a servant of God, either conceive this in his mind, or believe it in faith, or put it forward in discourse? And what will become of the precepts of the divine law, which say, \"Honour thy father and thy mother? \"[fn-63-P6317_2010716:29-nf] If the name of father, which in man is commanded to be honoured, is violated with impunity in God, what will become of what Christ Himself lays down in the Gospel, and says, \"He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death; \"[fn-63-P6318_2010967:30-nf] if He who bids that those who curse their parents after the flesh should be punished and slain, Himself quickens those who revile their heavenly and spiritual Father, and are hostile to the Church, their Mother? An execrable and detestable thing is actually asserted by some, that He who threatens the man who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, that he shall be guilty of eternal sin, Himself condescends to sanctify those who blaspheme against God the Father with saving baptism. And now, those who think that they must communicate with such as come to the Church without baptism, do not consider that they are becoming partakers with other men's, yea, with eternal sins, when they admit without baptism those who cannot, except in baptism, put off the sins of their blasphemies.","title":"Epistle LXXII.","author":"Cyprian"}]
