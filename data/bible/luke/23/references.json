But the question before us is rendered more urgent by what the Apostle John says: \"If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and the Lord shall give him life for him who sinneth not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.\"[fn-5-P546_192159:213-nf] For he manifestly shows that there are certain brethren for whom we are not commanded to pray, although the Lord bids us pray even for our persecutors. Nor can the question in hand be solved, unless we acknowledge that there are certain sins in brethren which are more heinous than the persecution of enemies. Moreover, that brethren mean Christians can be proved by many examples from the divine Scriptures. Yet that one is plainest which the apostle thus states: \"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother.\"[fn-5-P547_192757:214-nf] For he has not added the word our; but has thought it plain, as he wished a Christian who had an unbelieving wife to be understood by the expression brother. And therefore he says a little after, \"But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart: a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases.\"[fn-5-P548_193079:215-nf] Hence I am of opinion that the sin of a brother is unto death, when any one, after coming to the knowledge of God through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, makes an assault on the brotherhood, and is impelled by the fires of envy to oppose that grace itself by which he is reconciled to God. But the sin is not unto death, if any one has not withdrawn his love from a brother, but through some infirmity of disposition has failed to perform the incumbent duties of brotherhood. And on this accountour Lord also on the cross says, \"Father, forgive[fn-5-P549_193655:216-nf] them; for they know not what they do:\"[fn-5-P550_193728:217-nf] for, not yet having become partakers of thegrace of the Holy Spirit, they had not yet entered the fellowship of the holy brotherhood. And the blessed Stephen in the Acts of the Apostles prays for those by whom he is being stoned,[fn-5-P551_193982:218-nf] because they had not yet believed on Christ, and were not fighting against that common grace. And the Apostle Paul on this account, I believe, does not pray for Alexander, because he was already a brother, and had sinned unto death, viz. by making an assault on the brotherhood through envy. But for those who had not broken off their love, but had given way through fear, he prays that they may bepardoned. For thus he expresses it: \"Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord will reward him according to his works. Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatlywithstood our words.\"[fn-5-P552_194599:219-nf] Then he adds for whom he prays, thus expressing it: \"At my first defence no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.\"[fn-5-P553_194807:220-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":23,"verse":43,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"284","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1. By her importunity the widow in the gospel at last gained a hearing,[fn-5-P517_98598:293-nf] and by the same means one friend induced another to give him bread at midnight, when his door was shut and his servants were in bed.[fn-5-P518_98752:294-nf] The publican's prayers overcame God,[fn-5-P519_98820:295-nf] although God is invincible. Nineveh was saved by its tears from the impending ruin caused by its sin.[fn-5-P520_98948:296-nf] To what end, you ask, these far-fetched references? To this end, I make answer; that you in your greatness should look upon me in my littleness; that you, the rich shepherd, should not despise me, the ailing sheep. Christ Himself brought the robber from the cross to paradise,[fn-5-P521_99259:297-nf] and, to show that repentance is never too late, He turned a murderer's death into a martyrdom.

For her sake I do not grieve, but for myself I must; my loss is too great to be borne with resignation. Who can recall with dry eyes the glowing faith which induced a girl of twenty to raise the standard of the Cross, and to mourn the loss of her virginity more than the death of her husband? Who can recall without a sigh the earnestness of her prayers, the brilliancy of her conversation, the tenacity of her memory, and the quickness of her intellect? Had you heard her speak Greek you would have deemed her ignorant of Latin; yet when she used the tongue of Rome her words were free from a foreign accent. She even rivalled the great Origen in those acquirements which won for him the admiration of Greece. For in a few months, or rather days, she so completely mastered the difficulties of Hebrew as to emulate her mother's zeal in learning and singing the psalms. Her attire was plain, but this plainness was not, as it often is, a mark of pride. Indeed, her self-abasement was so perfect that she dressed no better than her maids, and was only distinguished from them by the greater ease of her walk. Her steps tottered with weakness, her face was pale and quivering, her slender neck scarcely upheld her head. Still she always had in her hand a prophet or a gospel. As I think of her my eyes fill with tears, sobs impede my voice, and such is my emotion that my tongue cleaves to the roof of my mouth. As she lay there dying, her poor frame parched with burning fever, and her relatives gathered round her bed, her last words were: \"Pray to the Lord Jesus, that He may pardon me, because what I would have done I have not been able to do.\" Be at peace, dear Blaesilla, in full assurance that your garments are always white.[fn-11-P1190_253506:790-nf] For yours is the purity of an everlasting virginity. I feel confident that my words are true: conversion can never be too late. The words to the dying robber are a pledge of this: \"Verily I say unto thee, today shall thou be with me in paradise.\"[fn-11-P1191_253775:791-nf] When at last her spirit was delivered from the burden of the flesh, and had returned to Him who gave it;[fn-11-P1192_253903:792-nf] when, too, after her long pilgrimage, she had ascended up into her ancient heritage, her obsequies were celebrated with customary splendor.

It is no difficult matter, my dear Domnio, to chatter at street corners or in apothecaries' shops and to pass judgment on the world. \"So-and-so has made a good speech, so-and-so a bad one; this man knows the Scriptures, that one is crazy; this man talks glibly, that never says a word at all.\" But who considers him worthy thus to judge every one? To make an outcry against a man in every street, and to heap, not definite charges, but vague imputations, on his head, is nothing. Any buffoon or litigiously disposed person can do as much. Let him put forth his hand, put pen to paper, and bestir himself; let him write books and prove in them all he can. Let him give me a chance of replying to his eloquence. I can return bite for bite, if I like; when hurt myself, I can fix my teeth in my opponent. I too have had a liberal education. As Juvenal says, \"I also have often withdrawn my hand from the ferule.\"[fn-17-P1763_422609:1223-nf] Of me, too, it may be said in the words of Horace, \"Flee from him; he has hay on his horn.\"[fn-17-P1764_422722:1224-nf] But I prefer to be a disciple of Him who says, \"I gave my back to the smiters ...I hid not my face from shame and spitting.\"[fn-17-P1765_422873:1225-nf] When He was reviled He reviled not again.[fn-17-P1766_422935:1226-nf] After the buffeting, the cross, the scourge, the blasphemies, at the very last He prayed for His crucifiers, saying, \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.\"[fn-17-P1767_423132:1227-nf] I, too, pardon the error of a brother. He has been deceived, I feel sure, by the art of the devil. Among the women he was held clever and eloquent; but, when my poor writings reached Rome, dreading me as a rival, he tried to rob me of my laurels. No man on earth, he resolved, should please his eloquent self, unless such as commanded respect rather than sought it, and showed themselves men to be feared more than favored. A man of consummate address, he desired, like an old soldier, with one stroke of the sword to strike down both his enemies,[fn-17-P1768_423705:1228-nf] and to make clear to every one that, whatever view he might take, Scripture was always with him. Well, he must condescend to send me his account of the matter, and to correct my indiscreet language, not by censure but by instruction. If he tries to do this, he will find that what seems forcible on a lounge is not equally forcible in court; and that it is one thing to discuss the doctrines of the divine law amid the spindles and work-baskets of girls and another to argue concerning them among men of education. As it is, without hesitation or shame, he raises again and again the noisy shout, \"Jerome condemns marriage,\" and, whilst he constantly moves among women with child, crying infants, and marriage-beds, he suppresses the words of the apostle just to cover me-poor me-with odium. However, when he comes by and by to write books and to grapple with me at close quarters, then he will feel it, then he will stick fast; Epicurus and Aristippus[fn-17-P1769_424693:1229-nf] will not be near him then; the swineherds[fn-17-P1770_424811:1230-nf] will not come to his aid; the prolific sow[fn-17-P1771_424890:1231-nf] will not so much as grunt.

But what He says may cause perplexity: \"For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\" Is it the case, then, that if we shall judge any thing with a rash judgment, God will also judge rashly with respect to us? or if we shall measure any thing with an unjust measure, is there with God also an unjust measure, according to which it shall be measured to us again? (for by the expression measure also, I suppose the judgment itself is meant.) By no means does God either judge rashly, or recompense to any one with an unjust measure; but it is so expressed, inasmuch as that very same rashness wherewith you punish another must necessarily punish yourself. Unless, perchance, it is to be imagined that injustice does harm in some way to him against whom it goes forth, but in no way to him from whom it goes forth; but nay, it often does no harm to him who suffers the injury, but it must necessarily do harm to him who inflicts it. For what harm did the injustice of the persecutors do to the martyrs? None; but very much to the persecutors themselves. For although some of them were turned from the error of their ways, yet at the time at which they were acting as persecutors, their wickedness was blinding them. So also a rash judgment frequently does no harm to him who is the object of the rash judgment; but to him who judges rashly, the rashness itself must necessarily do harm. According to such a rule, I judge of that saying also: \"Every one that strikes[fn-8-P876_331867:192-nf] with the sword shall perish with the sword.\"[fn-8-P877_331974:193-nf] For how many take the sword, and yet do not perish with the sword, Peter himself being an instance!

Where, I say, did they acquire diverse deserts? If they had indeed passed any part of their life in heaven, so as to be thrust down, or to sink down, to this world, and to tenant such bodily receptacles as are congruous to their own former life, then of course that man ought to be supposed to have led the better life previous to his present mortal body, who did not much deserve to be burdened with it, so as both to have a good disposition, and to be importuned by milder desires which he could easily overcome; and yet he did not deserve to have that grace preached to him whereby alone he could be delivered from the ruin of the second death. Whereas the other, who was hampered with a grosser body, as a penalty-so they suppose-for worse deserts, and was accordingly possessed of obtuser affections, whilst he was in the violent ardour of his lust succumbing to the snares of the flesh, and by his wicked life aggravating his former sins, which had brought him to such a pass, by a still more abandoned course of earthly pleasures,-either heard upon the cross, \"To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise,\"[fn-4-P465_376971:98-nf] or else joined himself to some apostle,by whose preaching he became a changed man,and was saved by the washing of regeneration,-so that where sin once abounded, grace did much more abound.

After a space of two days, on the third day\"[fn-24-P2455_800685:304-nf] -which is His glorious resurrection-He received back into the heavens (whence withal the Spirit Himself had come to the Virgin[fn-24-P2456_800866:305-nf] ) Him whose nativity and passion alike the Jews have failed to acknowledge. Therefore, since the Jews still contend that the Christ is not yet come, whom we have in so many ways approved[fn-24-P2457_801076:306-nf] to be come, let the Jews recognise their own fate, -a fate which they were constantly foretold as destined to incur after the advent of the Christ, on account of the impiety with which they despised and slew Him.

For \"the Lord of Sabaoth hath taken away, among the Jews from Jerusalem,\" among the other things named, \"the wise architect\" too,[fn-24-P2459_801918:308-nf] who builds the church, God's temple, and the holy city, and the house of the Lord.

And \"the clouds were commanded not to rain a shower upon the vineyard of Sorek,\"[fn-24-P2460_802259:309-nf] -the clouds being celestial benefits, which were commanded not to be forthcoming to the house of Israel; for it \"had borne thorns\"-whereof that house of Israel had wrought a crown for Christ-and not \"righteousness, but a clamour,\"-the clamour whereby it had extorted His surrender to the cross.[fn-24-P2461_802596:310-nf] And thus, the former gifts of grace being withdrawn, \"the law and the prophets were until John,\"[fn-24-P2462_802795:311-nf] and the fishpool of Bethsaida[fn-24-P2463_802860:312-nf] until the advent of Christ: thereafter it ceased curatively to remove from Israel infirmities of health; since, as the result of their perseverance in their frenzy, the name of the Lord was through them blasphemed, as it is written: \"On your account the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles: \"[fn-24-P2464_803232:313-nf] for it is from them that the infamy (attached to that name) began, and (was propagated during) the interval from Tiberius to Vespasian.

In few words he shows the whole mystery of the resurrection, that is, both the reality of the flesh and the growth in glory. And the meaning is: Who is he that cometh up from the earth, cometh up from blood? According to the[fn-71-P7131_2353827:97-nf] prophecy of Jacob, He has bound His foal to the vine, and has trodden the wine-press alone, and His garments are red with new wine from Bosor, that is from flesh, or from the tribulation of the world: for He Himself[fn-71-P7132_2354063:98-nf] has conquered the world. And, therefore, His garments are red and shining, because He is[fn-71-P7133_2354171:99-nf] beauteous in form more than the sons of men, and on account of the glory of His triumph they have been changed into a white robe; and then, in truth, as concerns Christ's flesh, were fulfilled the words,[fn-71-P7134_2354395:100-nf] \"Who is this that cometh up all in white, leaning upon her beloved?\" And that which is written in the same book:[fn-71-P7135_2354530:101-nf] \"My beloved is white and ruddy.\" These men are his true followers who have not[fn-71-P7136_2354629:102-nf] defiled their garments with women, for they have continued virgins, who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. And so they shall be in white clothing. Then shall the saying of our Lord appear perfectly realised:[fn-71-P7137_2354887:103-nf] \"All that my Father has given me, I shall not lose aught thereof, but I will raise it up again at the last day;\" the whole of His humanity, forsooth, which He had taken upon Him in its entirety at His birth. Then shall the sheep which was[fn-71-P7138_2355146:104-nf] lost, and was wandering in the lower world, be carried whole on the Saviour's shoulders, and the sheep which was sick with sin shall be supported by the mercy of the Judge. Then shall they see him who pierced Him, who shouted,[fn-71-P7139_2355395:105-nf] \"Crucify Him, crucify Him.\" Again and again shall they beat their breasts, they and their women, those women to whom our Lord said, as He carried His cross,[fn-71-P7140_2355572:106-nf] \"Ye daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me but weep for yourselves, and for your children.\" Then shall be fulfilled the prophecy of the angels, who said to the stupefied Apostles,[fn-71-P7141_2355776:107-nf] \"Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye looking with astonishment into heaven? This Jesus who is taken from you into heaven, shall come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven.\" But what are we to think of a man saying that our Lord[fn-71-P7142_2356031:108-nf] ate with the Apostles for forty days after His resurrection in order that they might not think Him to be a phantom, and then asserting that it was a phantom which did this very thing, which ate and which was seen by many in the flesh. That which was seen is either real, or false. If it is real, it follows that He really ate, and really had members. But if it is false, how could He be willing to give false impressions in order to prove the truth of His resurrection? For no one proves what is true by means of what is false. You will say, are we then going to eat after our resurrection? I know not. Scripture does not tell us; and yet, if the question be asked, I do not think we shall eat. For I have read that the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, while it promises[fn-71-P7143_2356821:109-nf] such things as eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man. Moses fasted forty days and forty nights. Human nature does not allow of this, but what is impossible with men is not impossible with God. Just as, in foretelling the future, it matters not whether a person announces what will take place after ten years or after a hundred, since the knowledge of futurity is all one; so he who can fast for forty days and yet live,-not, indeed, that he can of himself fast, but that he lives by the power of God,-will also be able to live for ever without food and drink. Why did our Lord eat an honeycomb? To prove the resurrection: not to give your palate the pleasure of tasting of honey. He asked for a fish broiled on the coals that He might[fn-71-P7144_2357612:110-nf] confirm the doubting Apostles, who did not dare approach Him because they thought they saw not a body, but a spirit.[fn-71-P7145_2357749:111-nf] The daughter of the ruler of the synagogue was raised to life and took food.[fn-71-P7146_2357841:112-nf] Lazarus, who had been four days dead, rose again, and comes before us at a dinner; not because he was accustomed to eat in the lower world, but because a case which presented such difficulties challenged the believer's criticism. As He showed them real hands and a real side, so He really ate with His disciples; really walked with Cleophas; conversed with men with a real tongue; really reclined at supper; with real hands took bread, blessed and brake it, and was offering it to them. And as for His suddenly vanishing out of their sight, that is the power of God, not of a shadowy phantom. Besides, even before His resurrection, when they had led Him out from Nazareth that they might cast Him down headlong from the brow of the hill, He passed through the midst of them, that is, escaped out of their hands. Can we follow Marcion, and say that because, when He was held fast, He escaped in a manner contrary to nature, therefore His birth must have been only apparent? Has not the Lord a privilege which is conceded to magicians? It is related of Apollonius of Tyana that, when standing in court before Domitian, he all at once disappeared. Do not put the power of the Lord on a level with the tricks of magicians, so that He may appear to have been what He was not, and may be thought to have eaten without teeth, walked without feet, broken bread without hands, spoken without a tongue, and showed a side which had no ribs.","title":"To Pammachius Against John of Jerusalem","author":false},{"chapter":23,"verse":34,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_16_homily_ix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"Observe again how he speaks covertly concerning Christ's power, showing that He raised Himself: just as in his first discourse he had said, \"Because it was not possible that He should be holden of it\" (ch. ii. 24), so here he says, \"And killed the Prince of Life.\" (v. 15.) It follows that the Life He had was not from another. The prince (or author) of evil would be he that first brought forth evil; the prince or author of murder, he who first originated murder; so also the Prince (or Author) of Life must be He Who has Life from Himself.[fn-5-P515_354190:10-nf] \"Whom God raised up,\" he continues: and now that he has uttered this, he adds, \"And his name, upon faith in his name, hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know; yea, the faith which is by Him hath given Him this perfect soundness. [The faith which is by Him h di autou pistij.] And[fn-5-P516_354892:11-nf] yet it was h eij autou pistij, \"the faith which is in Him\" (as its object) that did all. For the Apostles did not say, \"By the name,\" but, \"In the name,\" and it was in Him (eij autou) that the man believed. But they did not yet make bold to use the expression, \"The faith which is in Him.\" For, that the phrase \"By Him\" should not be too low, observe that after saying, \"Upon the faith of His name,\" he adds, \"His name hath made him strong,\" and then it is that he says, \"Yea, the faith which is by Him hath given him this perfect soundness.\" Observe how he implies, that in the kai ekeino former expression also \"Whom God raised up,\" he did but condescend to their low attainments. For that Person needed not Another's help for His rising again, Whose Name raised up a lame man, being all one as dead. Mark how on all occasions he adduces their own testimony. Thus above, he said, \"As ye yourselves also know;\" and, \"In the midst of you:\" and here again, \"Whom ye see and know: in the presence of you all.\" (ch. ii. 22.) And yet that it was, \"In His name,\" they knew not: but they did know that the man was lame, that he stands there whole.[fn-5-P517_356454:12-nf] They that had wrought the deed themselves confessed, that it was not by their own power, but by that of Christ. And had this assertion been unfounded, had they not been truly persuaded themselves that Christ had risen again, they would not have sought to establish the honor of a dead man instead of their own, especially while the eyes of the multitude were upon them. Then, when their minds were alarmed, immediately he encourages them, by the appellation of Brethren, \"And now, brethren, I wot, etc.\" For in the former discourse he foretold[fn-5-P518_357361:13-nf] nothing, but only says concerning Christ, \"Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly:\" here he adds an admonition. There he waited till the people spoke: here, he knew how much they had already effected, and that the present assembly was better disposed toward them. \"That through ignorance ye did it.\" And yet the circumstances mentioned above were not to be put to the score of ignorance. To choose the robber, to reject Him Who had been adjudged to be acquitted, to desire even to destroy Him-how should this be referred to ignorance? Nevertheless, he gives them liberty to deny it, and to change their mind about what had happened. \"Now this indeed, that you put to death the innocent, ye knew: but that you were killing \"the Prince of Life,\" this, belike, ye did not know.\" And he exculpated not them alone, but also the chief contrivers of the evil, \"ye and your rulers:\" for doubtless it would have roused their opposition, had he gone off into accusation. For the evil-doer, when you accuse him of some wickedness that he has done, in his endeavor to exonerate himself, grows more vehement. And he no longer says, \"Ye crucified,\" \"Ye killed,\" but, \"Ye did it;\" leading them to seek for pardon. If those rulers did it through ignorance, much more did these present.[fn-5-P519_358799:14-nf] \"But these things which God before had showed,\" etc. (v. 18.) But it is remarkable, that both in the first and in the second discourse, speaking to the same effect, that is, in the former, \"By the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God;\" and in this, \"God before had showed that Christ should suffer;\" in neither does he adduce any particular text in proof. The fact is, that each one of such passages is accompanied with many accusations, and with mention of the punishment in store for them [as]; \"I will deliver up,\" says one, \"the wicked in requital for His grave, and the rich in return for His death.\" (Is. liii. 9.) And again, * * * \"Those things,\" he says, \"which God before had showed by the mouth of all His prophets, that Christ should suffer, He hath so fulfilled.\" It shows the greatness of that \"counsel,\"[fn-5-P520_360241:15-nf] in that all spoke of it, and not one only. It does not follow, because the event was through ignorance, that it took place irrespectively of God's ordinance. See how great is the Wisdom of God, when it uses the wickedness of others to bring about that which must be. \"He hath fulfilled,\" he says: that they may not imagine that anything at all is wanting; for whatsoever Christ must needs suffer, has been fulfilled. But do not think, that, because the Prophets said this, and because ye did it through ignorance, this sufficeth to your exculpation. However, he does not express himself thus, but in milder terms says, \"Repent ye therefore.\" (v. 19.) \"Why? For[fn-5-P521_361167:16-nf] either it was through ignorance, or by the dispensation of God.\" \"That your sins may be blotted out.\" I do not mean the crimes committed at the Crucifixion; perhaps they were through ignorance; but so that your other sins may be blotted out: this[fn-5-P522_361686:17-nf] only. \"So shall the times of refreshing come unto you.\" Here he speaks of the Resurrection, obscurely.[fn-5-P523_362008:18-nf] For those are indeed times of refreshing, which Paul also looked for, when he said, \"We that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burthened.\" (2 Cor. v. 4.) Then to prove that Christ is the cause of the days of refreshing, he says, \"And He shall send Jesus Christ, which before was for you ordained.\" (v. 20.) He said not, \"That your sin may be blotter out,\" but, \"your sins;\" for he hints at that sin also. \"He shall send.\" And whence?[fn-5-P524_362774:19-nf] \"Whom the heaven must receive.\" (v. 21.) Still [\"must\"] \"receive?\" And why not simply, Whom the heaven hath received? This, as if discoursing of old times: so, he says, it is divinely ordered, so it is settled: not a word yet of His eternal subsistence.-\" For Moses indeed said unto the fathers, A Prophet shall the Lord raise up for you:\" \"Him shall ye hear in all things that He shall speak unto you:\" and having said, \"All things which God hath spoken by the mouth of all His holy Prophets,\" (v. 22) now indeed he brings in Christ Himself. For, if He predicted many things and it is necessary to hear Him, one would not be wrong in saying that the Prophets have spoken these things. But, besides, he wishes to show that the Prophets did predict the same things. And, if any one will look closely into the matter, he will find these things spoken in the Old Testament, obscurely indeed, but nevertheless spoken. \"Who was purposely designed,\" says he: in Whom[fn-5-P525_364901:20-nf] there is nothing novel. Here he also alarms them, by the thought that much remains to be fulfilled. But if so, how says he, \"Hath fulfilled?\" (v. 18.) The things which it was necessary \"that Christ should suffer,\" are fulfilled: the things which must come to pass, not yet. \"A prophet shall the Lord God raise up for you from among your brethren, like unto me.\" This would most conciliate them. Do you observe the sprinkling of low matters and high, side by side,-that He Who was to go up into the heavens should be like unto Moses? And yet it was a great thing too. For in fact He was not simply like unto Moses,[fn-5-P526_366140:21-nf] if so be that \"every soul which will not hear shall be destroyed.\" And one might mention numberless other things which show that He was not like unto Moses; so that it is a mighty text that he has handled. \"God shall raise Him up unto you,\" says Moses, \"from among your brethren,\" etc.: consequently Moses himself threatens those that should not hear. \"Yea, and all the prophets,\" etc.: all this[fn-5-P527_367034:22-nf] is calculated to attract \"Yea, and all the prophets,\" says the Apostle. \"from Samuel.\" He refrains from enumerating them singly, not to make his discourse too long; but having alleged that decisive testimony of Moses, he passes by the rest. \"Ye,\" he says, \"are the children of the Prophets, and of the covenant which God made.\" (v. 25) \"Children of the covenant;\" that is, heirs. For test they should think that they received this offer from the favor of Peter, he shows, that of old it was due to them, in order that they may the rather believe that such also is the will of God. \"Unto you first,\" he continues, \"God having raised up His Son Jesus, sent Him.\" (v. 26.) He does not say simply, \"Unto you He sent His Son,\" but also, after the resurrection, and when He had been crucified. For that they may not suppose that he himself granted them this favor, and not the Father, he says, \"To bless you.\" For if He is your Brother, and blesses you, the affair is a promise. \"Unto you first.\" That is, so far are you from having no share in these blessings, that He would have you become moreover promoters and authors of them to others. For[fn-5-P528_368375:23-nf] you are not to feel like castaways. \"Having raised up\": again, the Resurrection. \"In turning away,\" he says, \"every one of you from his iniquities.\" In this way He blesses you: not in a general way. And what kind of blessing is this? A great one. For of course not the turning a man away from his iniquities is itself sufficient to remit them also. And if it is not sufficient to remit, how should it be to confer a blessing? For it is not to be supposed that the transgressor becomes forthwith also blessed; he is simply released from his sins. But this,[fn-5-P529_369195:24-nf] \"Like unto me,\" would no wise apply. \"Hear ye Him,\" he says; and not this alone, but he adds, \"And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that Prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.\" When he has shown them that they had sinned, and has imparted forgiveness to them, and promised good things, then indeed, then he says, \"Moses also says the same thing.\" What sort of connection is this: \"Until the times of the restitution;\" and then to introduce Moses, saying, that[fn-5-P530_370379:25-nf] all that Christ said shall come to pass? Then also, on the other hand, he says, as matter of encomium (so that for this reason also ye ought to obey): \"Ye are the children of the prophets and of the covenant:\" i.e. heirs. Then why do you stand affected towards that which is your own, as if it were another's? True, you have done deeds worthy of condemnation; still you may yet obtain pardon. Having said this, with reason he is now able to say, \"Unto you God sent his Son Jesus to bless you.\" He says not, To save you, but what is greater; that the crucified Jesus blessed His crucifiers.","title":"Homily IX.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":23,"verse":34,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_16_homily_ix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"Observe again how he speaks covertly concerning Christ's power, showing that He raised Himself: just as in his first discourse he had said, \"Because it was not possible that He should be holden of it\" (ch. ii. 24), so here he says, \"And killed the Prince of Life.\" (v. 15.)

See how great is the Wisdom of God, when it uses the wickedness of others to bring about that which must be. \"He hath fulfilled,\" he says: that they may not imagine that anything at all is wanting; for whatsoever Christ must needs suffer, has been fulfilled. But do not think, that, because the Prophets said this, and because ye did it through ignorance, this sufficeth to your exculpation. However, he does not express himself thus, but in milder terms says, \"Repent ye therefore.\" (v. 19.) \"Why? For[fn-5-P521_361167:16-nf] either it was through ignorance, or by the dispensation of God.\" \"That your sins may be blotted out.\" I do not mean the crimes committed at the Crucifixion; perhaps they were through ignorance; but so that your other sins may be blotted out: this[fn-5-P522_361686:17-nf] only. \"So shall the times of refreshing come unto you.\" Here he speaks of the Resurrection, obscurely.[fn-5-P523_362008:18-nf] For those are indeed times of refreshing, which Paul also looked for, when he said, \"We that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burthened.\" (2 Cor. v. 4.) Then to prove that Christ is the cause of the days of refreshing, he says, \"And He shall send Jesus Christ, which before was for you ordained.\" (v. 20.) He said not, \"That your sin may be blotter out,\" but, \"your sins;\" for he hints at that sin also. \"He shall send.\" And whence?[fn-5-P524_362774:19-nf] \"Whom the heaven must receive.\" (v. 21.) Still [\"must\"] \"receive?\" And why not simply, Whom the heaven hath received? This, as if discoursing of old times: so, he says, it is divinely ordered, so it is settled: not a word yet of His eternal subsistence.-\" For Moses indeed said unto the fathers, A Prophet shall the Lord raise up for you:\" \"Him shall ye hear in all things that He shall speak unto you:\" and having said, \"All things which God hath spoken by the mouth of all His holy Prophets,\" (v. 22) now indeed he brings in Christ Himself. For, if He predicted many things and it is necessary to hear Him, one would not be wrong in saying that the Prophets have spoken these things. But, besides, he wishes to show that the Prophets did predict the same things. And, if any one will look closely into the matter, he will find these things spoken in the Old Testament, obscurely indeed, but nevertheless spoken. \"Who was purposely designed,\" says he: in Whom[fn-5-P525_364901:20-nf] there is nothing novel. Here he also alarms them, by the thought that much remains to be fulfilled. But if so, how says he, \"Hath fulfilled?\" (v. 18.) The things which it was necessary \"that Christ should suffer,\" are fulfilled: the things which must come to pass, not yet. \"A prophet shall the Lord God raise up for you from among your brethren, like unto me.\" This would most conciliate them. Do you observe the sprinkling of low matters and high, side by side,-that He Who was to go up into the heavens should be like unto Moses? And yet it was a great thing too. For in fact He was not simply like unto Moses,[fn-5-P526_366140:21-nf] if so be that \"every soul which will not hear shall be destroyed.\" And one might mention numberless other things which show that He was not like unto Moses; so that it is a mighty text that he has handled. \"God shall raise Him up unto you,\" says Moses, \"from among your brethren,\" etc.: consequently Moses himself threatens those that should not hear. \"Yea, and all the prophets,\" etc.: all this[fn-5-P527_367034:22-nf] is calculated to attract \"Yea, and all the prophets,\" says the Apostle. \"from Samuel.\" He refrains from enumerating them singly, not to make his discourse too long; but having alleged that decisive testimony of Moses, he passes by the rest. \"Ye,\" he says, \"are the children of the Prophets, and of the covenant which God made.\" (v. 25) \"Children of the covenant;\" that is, heirs. For test they should think that they received this offer from the favor of Peter, he shows, that of old it was due to them, in order that they may the rather believe that such also is the will of God. \"Unto you first,\" he continues, \"God having raised up His Son Jesus, sent Him.\" (v. 26.) He does not say simply, \"Unto you He sent His Son,\" but also, after the resurrection, and when He had been crucified. For that they may not suppose that he himself granted them this favor, and not the Father, he says, \"To bless you.\" For if He is your Brother, and blesses you, the affair is a promise. \"Unto you first.\" That is, so far are you from having no share in these blessings, that He would have you become moreover promoters and authors of them to others. For[fn-5-P528_368375:23-nf] you are not to feel like castaways. \"Having raised up\": again, the Resurrection. \"In turning away,\" he says, \"every one of you from his iniquities.\" In this way He blesses you: not in a general way. And what kind of blessing is this? A great one. For of course not the turning a man away from his iniquities is itself sufficient to remit them also. And if it is not sufficient to remit, how should it be to confer a blessing? For it is not to be supposed that the transgressor becomes forthwith also blessed; he is simply released from his sins. But this,[fn-5-P529_369195:24-nf] \"Like unto me,\" would no wise apply. \"Hear ye Him,\" he says; and not this alone, but he adds, \"And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that Prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.\" When he has shown them that they had sinned, and has imparted forgiveness to them, and promised good things, then indeed, then he says, \"Moses also says the same thing.\" What sort of connection is this: \"Until the times of the restitution;\" and then to introduce Moses, saying, that[fn-5-P530_370379:25-nf] all that Christ said shall come to pass? Then also, on the other hand, he says, as matter of encomium (so that for this reason also ye ought to obey): \"Ye are the children of the prophets and of the covenant:\" i.e. heirs. Then why do you stand affected towards that which is your own, as if it were another's? True, you have done deeds worthy of condemnation; still you may yet obtain pardon. Having said this, with reason he is now able to say, \"Unto you God sent his Son Jesus to bless you.\" He says not, To save you, but what is greater; that the crucified Jesus blessed His crucifiers.","title":"Homily IX.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":23,"verse":34,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_16_homily_ix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"Observe again how he speaks covertly concerning Christ's power, showing that He raised Himself: just as in his first discourse he had said, \"Because it was not possible that He should be holden of it\" (ch. ii. 24), so here he says, \"And killed the Prince of Life.\" (v. 15.) It follows that the Life He had was not from another. The prince (or author) of evil would be he that first brought forth evil; the prince or author of murder, he who first originated murder; so also the Prince (or Author) of Life must be He Who has Life from Himself.[fn-5-P515_354190:10-nf] \"Whom God raised up,\" he continues: and now that he has uttered this, he adds, \"And his name, upon faith in his name, hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know; yea, the faith which is by Him hath given Him this perfect soundness. [The faith which is by Him h di autou pistij.] And[fn-5-P516_354892:11-nf] yet it was h eij autou pistij, \"the faith which is in Him\" (as its object) that did all. For the Apostles did not say, \"By the name,\" but, \"In the name,\" and it was in Him (eij autou) that the man believed. But they did not yet make bold to use the expression, \"The faith which is in Him.\" For, that the phrase \"By Him\" should not be too low, observe that after saying, \"Upon the faith of His name,\" he adds, \"His name hath made him strong,\" and then it is that he says, \"Yea, the faith which is by Him hath given him this perfect soundness.\" Observe how he implies, that in the kai ekeino former expression also \"Whom God raised up,\" he did but condescend to their low attainments. For that Person needed not Another's help for His rising again, Whose Name raised up a lame man, being all one as dead. Mark how on all occasions he adduces their own testimony. Thus above, he said, \"As ye yourselves also know;\" and, \"In the midst of you:\" and here again, \"Whom ye see and know: in the presence of you all.\" (ch. ii. 22.) And yet that it was, \"In His name,\" they knew not: but they did know that the man was lame, that he stands there whole.[fn-5-P517_356454:12-nf] They that had wrought the deed themselves confessed, that it was not by their own power, but by that of Christ. And had this assertion been unfounded, had they not been truly persuaded themselves that Christ had risen again, they would not have sought to establish the honor of a dead man instead of their own, especially while the eyes of the multitude were upon them. Then, when their minds were alarmed, immediately he encourages them, by the appellation of Brethren, \"And now, brethren, I wot, etc.\" For in the former discourse he foretold[fn-5-P518_357361:13-nf] nothing, but only says concerning Christ, \"Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly:\" here he adds an admonition. There he waited till the people spoke: here, he knew how much they had already effected, and that the present assembly was better disposed toward them. \"That through ignorance ye did it.\" And yet the circumstances mentioned above were not to be put to the score of ignorance. To choose the robber, to reject Him Who had been adjudged to be acquitted, to desire even to destroy Him-how should this be referred to ignorance? Nevertheless, he gives them liberty to deny it, and to change their mind about what had happened. \"Now this indeed, that you put to death the innocent, ye knew: but that you were killing \"the Prince of Life,\" this, belike, ye did not know.\" And he exculpated not them alone, but also the chief contrivers of the evil, \"ye and your rulers:\" for doubtless it would have roused their opposition, had he gone off into accusation. For the evil-doer, when you accuse him of some wickedness that he has done, in his endeavor to exonerate himself, grows more vehement. And he no longer says, \"Ye crucified,\" \"Ye killed,\" but, \"Ye did it;\" leading them to seek for pardon. If those rulers did it through ignorance, much more did these present.[fn-5-P519_358799:14-nf] \"But these things which God before had showed,\" etc. (v. 18.) But it is remarkable, that both in the first and in the second discourse, speaking to the same effect, that is, in the former, \"By the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God;\" and in this, \"God before had showed that Christ should suffer;\" in neither does he adduce any particular text in proof. The fact is, that each one of such passages is accompanied with many accusations, and with mention of the punishment in store for them [as]; \"I will deliver up,\" says one, \"the wicked in requital for His grave, and the rich in return for His death.\" (Is. liii. 9.) And again, * * * \"Those things,\" he says, \"which God before had showed by the mouth of all His prophets, that Christ should suffer, He hath so fulfilled.\" It shows the greatness of that \"counsel,\"[fn-5-P520_360241:15-nf] in that all spoke of it, and not one only.

For as air is not retained in water when it is dragged down by some weighty body and left in the depth of the water, but rises quickly to its kindred element, while the water is often raised up together with the air in its upward rush, being moulded by the circle of air into a convex shape with a slight and membrane-like surface, so too, when the true Life that underlay the flesh sped up, after the Passion, to Itself, the flesh also was raised up with It, being forced upwards from corruption to incorruptibility by the Divine immortality. And as fire that lies in wood hidden below the surface is often unobserved by the senses of those who see, or even touch it, but is manifest when it blazes up, so too, at His death (which He brought about at His will, Who separated His soul from His Body, Who said to His own Father \"Into Thy hands I commend My Spirit[fn-16-P1650_955589:54-nf] ,\" Who, as He says, \"had power to lay it down and had power to take it again[fn-16-P1651_955690:55-nf] \"), He Who, because He is the Lord of glory, despised that which is shame among men, having concealed, as it were, the flame of His life in His bodily Nature, by the dispensation of His death[fn-16-P1652_955902:56-nf] , kindled and inflamed it once more by the power of His own Godhead, fostering into life that which had been brought to death, having infused with the infinity of His Divine power that humble first-fruits of our nature, made it also to be that which He Himself was-making the servile form to be Lord, and the Man born of Mary to be Christ, and Him Who was crucified through weakness to be Life and power, and making all that is piously conceived to be in God the Word to be also in that which the Word assumed, so that these attributes no longer seem to be in either Nature by way of division, but that the perishable Nature being, by its commixture with the Divine, made anew in conformity with the Nature that overwhelms it, participates in the power of the Godhead, as if one were to say that mixture makes a drop of vinegar mingled in the deep to be sea, by reason that the natural quality of Ibis liquid does not continue in the infinity of that which overwhelms it[fn-16-P1653_957000:57-nf] .

For when the Lord had ascended into heaven after His resurrection, having spent forty days with His disciples, and the day of Pentecost being fully come, He sent unto them the Holy Spirit as He had promised. Accordingly the Spirit coming at that time filled the place, and there was first a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, as we read in the Acts of the Apostles, and \"there appeared unto them,\" it says, \"cloven tongues as of fire, and it sat upon each of them; and they began to speak with tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.\"[fn-4-P445_166735:5-nf] Here we have seen a dove descending upon the Lord; there, cloven tongues upon the assembled disciples: in the former, simplicity is shown; in the latter, fervency. Now there are who are said to be simple, who are only indolent; they are called simple, but they are only slow. Not such was Stephen, full of the Holy Ghost: he was simple, because he injured no one; he was fervent, because he reproved the ungodly. For he held not his peace before the Jews. His are those burning words: \"Ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised of heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Spirit.\" Mighty impetuosity; but it is the dove without gall raging. For that you know that he was fierce without gall, see how, upon hearing these words, they who were the ravens immediately took up stones and rushed together upon this dove. They begin to stone Stephen; and he who a little before stormed and glowed with ardor of spirit,-who had, as it were, made an onset on his enemies, and like one full of violence had attacked them in such fiery and burning words as you have heard, \"Ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears,\" that any one who heard those words might fancy that Stephen, if he were allowed, would have them consumed at once,-but when the stones thrown from their hands reached him, with fixed knee he saith, \"Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.\"[fn-4-P446_168106:6-nf] He held fast to the unity of the dove.

But you say, \"Now Thou knowest how holy, how innocent, how pure from all deceit, wrong, and robbery are the hands which I spread out before Thee.\" He says that he fasts twice in the week, that he may afflict his vicious and wanton flesh, and he gives tithes of all his substance.

His doubts and anxieties preclude us, they say, from assigning to Him that likeness to God which would belong to a nature equal to God as being born His Only-begotten.

But perhaps you think your impiety has still an opportunity left to see in the words, Father, into Thy hands I commend My Spirits[fn-20-P2034_1322656:47-nf] , a proof that He feared the descent into the lower world, and even the necessity of death. But when you read these words and could not understand them, would it not have been better to say nothing, or to pray devoutly to be shewn their meaning, than to go astray with such barefaced assertions, too mad with your own folly to perceive the truth? Could you believe that He feared the depths of the abyss, the scorching flames, or the pit of avenging punishment, when you listen to His words to the thief on the cross, Verily, I say unto thee, To-day shall thou be with Me in Paradise[fn-20-P2035_1323265:48-nf] ? Such a nature with such power could not be shut up within the confines of the nether world, nor even subjected to fear of it. When He descended to Hades, He was never absent from Paradise (just as He was always in Heaven when He was preaching on earth as the Son of Man), but promised His martyr[fn-20-P2036_1323576:49-nf] a home there, and held out to him the transports of perfect happiness. Bodily fear cannot touch Him Who reaches indeed down as far as Hades, but by the power of His nature is present in all things everywhere. As little can the abyss[fn-20-P2037_1323843:50-nf] of Hell and the terrors of death lay hold upon the nature which rules the world, boundless in the freedom of its spiritual power, confident of the raptures of Paradise; for the Lord Who was to descend to Hades, was also to dwell in Paradise. Separate, if you can, from His indivisible nature a part which could fear punishment: send the one part of Christ to Hades to suffer pain, the other, you must leave in Paradise to reign: for the thief says, Remember me when Thou comest in Thy Kingdom. It was the groan he heard, I suppose, when the nails pierced the hands of our Lord, which provoked in him this blessed confession of faith: he learnt the Kingdom of Christ from His weakened and stricken body! He begs that Christ will remember him when He comes in His Kingdom: you say that Christ feared as He hung dying upon the cross. The Lord promises him, To-day, shalt thou be with Me in Paradise; you would subject Christ to Hades and fear of punishment. Your faith has the opposite expectation. The thief confessed Christ in His Kingdom as He hung on the cross, and was rewarded with Paradise from the cross: you who impute to Christ the pain of punishment and the fear of death, will fail of Paradise and His Kingdom.","title":"Book X","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":23,"verse":43,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_17_book_x","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"65","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"60.

When He was about to restore Lazarus, He prayed to the Father: but what need had He of prayer, Who said, Father, I thank Thee, that Thou hast heard Me; and I know that Thou hearest Me always, but because of the multitude I said it, that they may believe that Thou didst send Me[fn-21-P2155_1384583:128-nf] ? He prayed then for us, that we may know Him to be the Son; the words of prayer availed Him nothing, but He said them for the advancement of our faith. He was not in want of help, but we of teaching.

The Father is besought for us, He speaks for us: may all this lead us to believe and confess! The answer of the Glorifier is granted not to the prayer for glory, but to the ignorance of the bystanders: must we not then regard the complaint of suffering, when He found His greatest joy in suffering, as intended for the building up of our faith? Christ prayed for His persecutors, because they knew not what they did. He promised Paradise from the cross, because He is God the King. He rejoiced upon the cross, that all was finished when He drank the vinegar, because He had fulfilled all prophecy before He died. He was born for us, suffered for us, died for us, rose again for us. This alone is necessary for our salvation, to confess the Son of God risen from the dead: why then should we die in this state of godless unbelief? If Christ, ever secure of His divinity, made clear to us His death, Himself indifferent to death, yet dying to assure that it was true humanity that He had assumed: why should we use this very confession of the Son of God that for us He became Son of Man and died as the chief weapon to deny His divinity?

The words, \"The depth of its phantasy,\" are an explanation of the previous verse, for the depth is the abyss; and \"Uttered its voice\" is to be understood before them, that is, as we have said, it expressed what it perceived. Now the phantasy is the vision, which it did not hold or conceal, but poured forth in confession. \"The sun was raised up, and the moon stood still in her course;\" that is, Christ ascended into heaven, and the Church was established under her King. \"Thy darts shall go in the light;\" that is, Thy words shall not be sent in secret, but openly. For He had said to His own disciples, \"What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in the light.\"[fn-34-P3451_1871650:48-nf] \"By threatening thou shall diminish the earth;\" that is, by that threatening Thou shall humble men. \"And in fury Thou shall cast down the nations;\" for in punishing those who exalt themselves Thou dashest them one against another. \"Thou wentest forth for the salvation of Thy people, that Thou mightest save Thy Christ; Thou hast sent death on the heads of the wicked.\" None of these words require exposition. \"Thou hast lifted up the bonds, even to the neck.\" This may be understood even of the good bonds of wisdom, that the feet may be put into its fetters, and the neck into its collar. \"Thou hast struck off in amazement of mind the bonds\" must be understood for, He lifts up the good and strikes off the bad, about. which it is said to Him, \"Thou hast broken asunder my bonds,\"[fn-34-P3452_1872452:49-nf] and that \"in amazement of mind,\" that is, wonderfully. \"The heads of the mighty shall be moved in it;\" to wit, in that wonder. \"They shall open their teeth like a poor man eating secretly.\" For some of the mighty among the Jews shall come to the Lord, admiring His works and words, and shall greedily eat the bread of His doctrine in secret for fear of the Jews, just as the Gospel has shown they did. \"And Thou hast sent into the sea Thy horses, troubling many waters,\" which are nothing else than many people; for unless all were troubled, some would not be converted with fear, others pursued with fury. \"I gave heed, and my belly trembled at the voice of the prayer of my lips; and trembling entered into my bones, and my habit of body was troubled under me.\" He gave heed to those things which he said, and was himself terrified at his own prayer, which he had poured forth prophetically, and in which he discerned things to come.

Furthermore this is plainly taught by the divine Scripture, for so the holy Matthew narrates the event, \"When the even was come there came a rich man of Arimathaea named Joseph who also himself was Jesus' disciple: he went to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered, and when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre and departed.\"[fn-47-P4776_1177426:62-nf] See how often he mentions the body in order to stop the mouths of them who blaspheme the Godhead. The same course is pursued by the thrice blessed Mark, whose narrative I will also quote. \"And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath, Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus. And Pilate marvelled if He were already dead; and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether He had been any while dead. And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph, and he brought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped Him in the linen, and laid Him in a sepulchre,\"[fn-47-P4777_1178202:63-nf] and so on. Observe with admiration, the harmony of terms, and how consistently and continuously the word body is introduced. The illustrious Luke, too, relates just in the same way how Joseph begged the body and after he had received it treated it with due rites.[fn-47-P4778_1178487:64-nf] By the divine John we are told yet more, \"Joseph of Arimathaea being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore and took the body of Jesus. And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about a hundred pound weight. Then took they the body of Jesus and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid. There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day, for the sepulchre was nigh at band.\"[fn-47-P4779_1179270:65-nf] Observe how often mention is made of the body; how the Evangelist shows that it was the body which was nailed to the cross, the body begged by Joseph of Pilate, the body taken down from the tree, the body wrapped in linen clothes with the myrrh and aloes, and then the name of the person given to it; and Jesus said to have been laid in a tomb. Thus the angel said, \"Come see the place where the Lord lay,\"[fn-47-P4780_1179699:66-nf] naming the part by the name of the whole; and we constantly do just the same. In this place, we say, such an one was buried; not the body of such an one. Every one in his senses knows that we are speaking of the body, and such a mode of speech is customary in divine Scripture. Aaron, we read, died and they buried him on Mount Hor.[fn-47-P4781_1180054:67-nf] Samuel died and they buried him at Ramah,[fn-47-P4782_1180113:68-nf] and there are many similar instances. The same use is followed by the divine Apostle when speaking of the death of the Lord. \"I delivered unto you first of all,\" he writes, \"that which I also received how that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures,\"[fn-47-P4783_1180489:69-nf] and so on.","title":"Dialogue III.-The Impassible.","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":23,"verse":46,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_21_dialogue_iii_the_impassible_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"662","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"\"That which can be mastered was mastered; that which can be crucified was crucified, but He that had power alike to dwell in it and to leave it said `Father into thy hands I commend my Spirit,'[fn-52-P5233_1251961:154-nf] not into the hands of them who were trying to hasten His death.

How did He die? `Father, into thy hands I commend my Spirit.'[fn-52-P5234_1253285:155-nf] The Spirit departed; the body remained; the body remained without breath. Did He not die then? He died for us. The Shepherd offered the sheep, the Priest offered the sacrifice, He gave Himself for us. `He that spared not His own Son but delivered Him up for us all.'[fn-52-P5235_1253575:156-nf] I do not reject the words, but I want the meaning of the words. The Lord says that the bread of God came down from Heaven,[fn-52-P5236_1253722:157-nf] and though I cannot express it more clearly on account of the mysteries, He says in explanation `It is my flesh.' Did the flesh of the Son come down from heaven? No. How then does He say, and that in explanation, the bread of God lives and came down from Heaven? He refers the properties of the power to the flesh, because the power which assumed the flesh came down from heaven. Change the terms then; He refers to the power what the flesh suffers. How did Christ suffer for us? He was spat upon, He was smitten on the cheek, they put a crown about His brow, His hands and feet were pierced. All these sufferings were of the body, but they are referred to Him that dwelt therein. Throw a stone at the Emperor's statue. What is the cry? `You have insulted the Emperor.' Tear the Emperor's robe. What is the cry? `You have rebelled against the Emperor.' Crucify Christ's body. What is the cry? `Christ died for us.' But what need of me and thee? Let us go to the Evangelists. How have you received from the Lord how the Lord died? They read `Father into thy hands I commend my Spirit.'[fn-52-P5237_1254827:158-nf] The Spirit on high, the body on the Cross for us.

Before this indeed, she considered that deceiving Devil, that wicked Demon to be more worth believing than the commandments of God, and at the mere sight of the tree, she trampled under foot the law which had been laid down by Him. But when the expulsion from Paradise came, consider how much better and wiser she grew. For when she bare a son, she says \"I have gotten a man through the Lord.\"[fn-10-P1007_672635:11-nf] She straightway flew to the master, who before this had despised the master, and she neither ascribes the matter to nature, nor puts the birth down to the laws of marriage, but she recognizes the Lord of Nature, and acknowledges thanks to Him for the birth of the little child. And she who before this deceived her husband, afterwards even trained the little child, and gave him a name which of itself was able to bring the gift of God to her remembrance: and again when she bare another, she says \"God hath raised up seed to me in place of Abel whom Cain slew.\"[fn-10-P1008_673216:12-nf] The woman remembers her calamity, and does not become impatient but she gives thanks to God, and calls the little child after his gift, furnishing it with constant material for instruction. Thus even in his very deprivation God conferred greater benefit. The woman suffered expulsion from Paradise, but by means of her ejection she was led to a knowledge of God, so that she found a greater thing than she lost. And if it were profitable, says one, to suffer expulsion from Paradise, for what cause did God give Paradise at the beginning? This turned out profitably to man, on account of our carelessness, since, if at least, they had taken heed to themselves, and had acknowledged their master, and had known how to be self-restrained, and to keep within bounds, they would have remained in honour. But when they treated the gifts which had been given them with insolence, then it became profitable, that they should be ejected. For what cause then did God give at first? In order that he might shew forth his own lovingkindness, and because He himself was prepared to bring us even to greater honour. But we were the cause of chastisement and punishment on all sides, ejecting ourselves through our indifference to goods which were given to us. Just as therefore an affectionate father, at first indeed, suffers his own son to dwell in his home, and to enjoy all his father's goods, but when he sees that he has become worthless of the honour, he leads him away from his table, and puts him far from his own sight, and often casts him forth from his paternal home, in order that he, suffering expulsion, and becoming better by this slight and this dishonour, may again shew himself worthy of restoration, and may succeed to his father's inheritance: So has God done. He gave Paradise to man. He cast him out when he appeared unworthy, in order that by his dwelling outside, and through his dishonour, he might become better, and more self-restrained, and might appear worthy again of restoration. Since after those things he did become better, he brings him back again and says \"To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.\"[fn-10-P1009_675359:13-nf] Dost thou see that not the gift of Paradise but even the ejection from Paradise was a token of the greatest tender care?

But, whilst they read, let them not wonder that they, whose are the, books, understand not by reason of the darkness of enmity. For that they would not Understand was foretold beforehand by the same Prophets; which it behoved should be fulfilled in like manner as the rest, and that by the secret and just judgment of Coda due punishment should be rendered to their deserts. He indeed, Whom they crucified, and unto Whom they gave gall and vinegar, although when hanging upon the Tree, by reason of those whom He had been about to lead forth from darkness into light, He said unto the Father, \"Forgive them, for they know not what they do;\"[fn-33-P3371_1550460:30-nf] yet by reason of those whom through more hidden causes He had been about to desert, by the Prophet so long before foretold, \"They gave Me gall for My meat, and in My thirst they gave Me vinegar to drink; let their table become a snare before them, and a recompense, and a stumbling-block: let their eyes be darkened that they see not, and ever bow Thou down their back.\"[fn-33-P3372_1550852:31-nf] Thus, having with them the clearest testimonies of our cause, they walk round about with eyes darkened, that by their means those testimonies may be proved, wherein they themselves are disapproved.

But as we have already, in a way proportionate to the brevity of our discourse, spoken of the objects of the promise, and of its own stability; let us now look at this one point, as far as we are able, what it is that He was pleased to promise when He said, \"I will that they also whom Thou hast given me be with me where I am.\" As far as pertains to the creaturehood wherein He was made of the seed of David according to the flesh,[fn-35-P3572_1982634:6-nf] not even He Himself was yet where He would afterwards be: but He could say in this way, \"where I am,\" to let us understand that He was soon to ascend into heaven, so that He spake of Himself as being already there, where He was presently to be. He could do so also in the same way as He had said on a former occasion, when speaking to Nicodemus, \"No man ascendeth into heaven, save He that came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven.\"[fn-35-P3573_1983100:7-nf] For there also He did not say, Will be, but \"is,\" because of the oneness of person, wherein God is at once man, and man God. He promised, therefore, that we should be in heaven; for thither the servant-form, which He received of the Virgin, has been elevated, and set at the right hand of the Father. Because of the same blessed hope the apostle also says: \"But God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ; by whose grace we are saved; and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.\"[fn-35-P3574_1983744:8-nf] And so accordingly we may understand the Lord to have said, \"That where I am, there they may be also.\" He, indeed, said of Himself that He was there already; but of us He merely declared that He wished us to be there with Him, without any indication that we were there already But what the Lord said that He wished to be done, the apostle spake of as already accomplished. For he said not, He will yet raise us up, and make us sit in heavenly places; but, \"hath raised us up, and made us sit in heavenly places:\" for it is not without good grounds, but in believing assurance, that he reckons as already done what he is certain will yet be done. But if it is in respect of the form of God, wherein He is equal to the Father, that we would be inclined to understand His words, \"I will that they also be with me, where I am,\" let our mind get quit of every thought of material images: whateverthe soul has had presented to it, that is endowed with length, or breadth, or thickness, tinted by the light with any sort of bodily hue, or diffused through local space of any kind, whether finite or infinite, let it, as far as possible, turn away from all such notions the glance of its contemplation on the inward bent of its thoughts. And let us not be making inquiries as to where the Son, the Father's co-equal, is, since no one has yet found out where He is not. But if any one would inquire, let him inquire rather how he may be with Him; not everywhere as He is, but wherever He may be. For when He said to the man that was expiating his crimes on the tree, and making confession unto salvation, \"Today shall thou be with me in paradise,\"[fn-35-P3575_1985400:9-nf] in respect to His human nature His own soul was on that very day to be in hell,[fn-35-P3576_1985500:10-nf] His flesh in the sepulchre; but as respected His Godhead He was certainly also in paradise. And therefore the soul of the thief, absolved from his by-gone crimes, and already in the blessed enjoyment of His grace, although it could not be everywhere as He was, yet could on that very day be also with Him in paradise, from which He, who is always everywhere, had not withdrawn. On this account, doubtless, it was not enough for Him to say, \"I will that they also be where I am;\" but He added, \"with me.\" For to be with Him is the chief good. For even the miserable can be where He is, since wheresoever any are, there is He also; but the blessed only are with Him, because it is only of Him that they can be blessed. Was it not truly said to God, \"If I ascend into heaven, Thou art there; and if I go down into hell, Thou art present?\"[fn-35-P3577_1986354:11-nf] or is not Christ after all that Wisdom of God which \"penetrateth everywhere because of its purity\"?[fn-35-P3578_1986474:12-nf] But the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not.[fn-35-P3579_1986567:13-nf] And similarly, to take a kind of illustration from what is visible, although greatly unlike, as the blind man, even though he be where the light is, is yet not himself with the light, but is really absent from that which is present; so the unbeliever and profane, or even the believer and pious, because not yet competent to gaze on the light of wisdom, although he cannot be anywhere that Christ is not there likewise, yet is not himself with Christ, I mean in actual sight.

The doctrines of the Gospel were well known to holy and blessed David in his capacity of Prophet, and although it was under the Law that he lived his bodily life, he yet filled, as far as in him lay, the requirements of the Apostolic behest and justified the witness borne to him by God in the words: I have found a man after My own heart, David, the son of Jesse[fn-24-P2495_1584315:1-nf] .

They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my garments, and for my vesture they did cast lots.\"[fn-24-P2457_1062159:156-nf] ","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":23,"verse":44,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"83","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"41. First, then, let us consider what the hour really is at which He can have been crucified; and then we shall see how it happens that Mark has reported Him to have been crucified at the third hour. Now it was about the sixth hour when Pilate, who was sitting, as has been stated, at the time upon the judgment-seat, delivered Him up to be crucified. The expression is not that it was the sixth hour fully, but only that it was about the sixth hour; that is to say, the fifth hour was entirely gone, and so much of the sixth hour had also been entered upon.

And some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.\"[fn-25-P2536_1099985:210-nf] Mark's agreement with this is almost complete, so far as regards the words, and not only almost, but altogether complete, so far as the sense is concerned. Matthew next makes this statement: \"And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave Him to drink.\"[fn-25-P2537_1100331:211-nf] Mark presents it in a similar form: \"And one ran, and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave Him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take Him down.\"[fn-25-P2538_1100560:212-nf] Matthew, however, has represented these words about Elias to have been spoken, not by the person who offered the sponge with the vinegar, but by the rest.

Luke, again, has introduced this notice of the vinegar previous to his report of the robber's insolence. He gives it thus: \"And the soldiers also mocked Him, coming to Him, and offering Him vinegar, and saying, If thou be the King of the Jews, save thyself.\"[fn-25-P2540_1101262:214-nf] It has been Luke's purpose to embrace in one statement what was done and what was said by the soldiers.

But John has stated a fact which is noticed by none of the other three, namely, that He said \"It is finished,\" after He had received the vinegar. This cry we take to have been uttered previous to the loud voice referred to. For these are John's words: \"When Jesus, therefore, had received the vinegar, He said, It is finished; and He bowed His head, and gave up the ghost.\"[fn-25-P2550_1104115:221-nf] In the interval elapsing between this cry, \"It is finished,\" and what is referred to in the subsequent sentence, \"and He bowed His head and gave up the ghost,\" the voice was uttered which John himself has passed over without record, but which the other three have noticed. For the precise succession appears to be this, namely, that He said first \"It is finished,\" when what had been prophesied regarding Him was fulfilled in Him, and that thereafter-as if He had been waiting for this, like one, indeed, who died when He willed it to be so-He commended His spirit [to His Father], and resigned it.[fn-25-P2551_1104736:222-nf] But, whatever the order may be in which a person may consider it likely that these words were spoken, he ought above all things to guard against entertaining the notion that any one of the evangelists is in antagonism with another, when one leaves unmentioned something which another has repeated, or particularizes something which another has passed by in silence.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":23,"verse":45,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"104","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"56.

For, with the intention of attaching miracle to miracle, he has told us first how \"the sun was darkened,\" and then has deemed it right to subjoin the said sentence in immediate succession, namely, \"And the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.\" Thus it would appear that he has introduced at an earlier point this incident, which really took place when the Lord expired, so as to give us there a summary description of the circumstances relating to the drinking of the vinegar, and the loud voice, and the death itself, which are understood to have taken place previous to the rending of the veil, and after the darkness had come in. For Matthew has inserted this sentence, \"And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent,\" in immediate succession to the statement, \"And Jesus, crying again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost;\" and has thus given us clearly to understand that the time when the veil was rent was after Jesus had given up His spirit. If, however, he had not added the words, \"And behold,\" but had said simply, \"And the veil of the temple was rent,\" it would have been uncertain whether Mark and he had narrated the incident in the form of a recapitulation, while Luke had kept the exact order, or whether Luke had given the summary account of what these others had introduced in the correct historical succession.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":23,"verse":47,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"106","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"57. Matthew proceeds thus: \"And the earth did quake, and the rocks rent; and the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, and came out of the graves after the resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.\"[fn-25-P2561_1107605:226-nf] There is no reason to fear that these facts, which have been related only by Matthew, may appear to be inconsistent with the narratives presented by any one of the rest. The same evangelist then continues as follows: \"Now when the centurion, and they that were with him watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.\"[fn-25-P2562_1108032:227-nf] Mark offers this version: \"And when the centurion which stood over against Him saw that He so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this was the Son of God.\"[fn-25-P2563_1108225:228-nf] Luke's report runs thus: \"Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.\"[fn-25-P2564_1108376:229-nf] Here Matthew says that it was when they saw the earthquake that the centurion and those who were with him were thus astonished, whereas Luke represents the man's amazement to have been drawn forth by the fact that Jesus uttered such a cry, and then gave up the ghost; thus making it clear how He had it in His own power to determine the time for His dying. But this involves no discrepancy. For as the said Matthew not only tells us how the centurion \"saw the earthquake,\" but also appends the words, \"and those things that were done,\" he has indicated that there was room enough for Luke to represent the Lord's death as itself the thing which called forth the centurion's wonder. For that event is also one of the things which were done in so marvellous a manner then. At the same time, even although Matthew had not added any such statement, it would still have been perfectly legitimate to suppose, that as many astonishing things did take place at that time, and as the centurion and those who were with him may well have looked upon them all with amazement, the historians were at liberty to select for narration any particular incident which they were severally disposed to instance as the subject of the man's wonder. And it would not be fair to impeach them with inconsistency, simply because one of them may have specified one occurrence as the immediate cause of the centurion's amazement, while another introduces a different incident. For all these events together had really been matters for the man's astonishment. Again, the mere fact that one evangelist tells us that the centurion said, \"Truly this was the Son of God,\" while another informs us that the words were, \"Truly this man was the Son of God,\" will create no difficulty to any one who has retained some recollection of the numerous statements and discussions bearing upon similar cases, which have already been given above. For these different versions of the words both convey precisely the same sense and although one writer introduces the wore \"man\" while another does not, that implies no kind of contradiction. A greater appearance of discrepancy may be supposed to be created by the circumstance, that the words which Luke reports the centurion to have uttered are not \"This was the Son of God,\" but \"This was a righteous man.\" But we ought to suppose either that both things were actually said by the centurion, and that two of the evangelists have recorded the one expression, and the third the other; or else perhaps that it was Luke's intention to bring out the exact idea which the centurion had in view when he said that Jesus was the Son of God. For it may be the case that the centurion did not really understand Him to be the Only-begotten, equal with the Father; but that he called Him the Son of God simply because he believed Him to be a righteous man, as many righteous men have been named sons of God. Moreover, when Luke says, \"Now when the centurion saw what was done,\" he has really used terms which cover all the marvellous things which occurred on that occasion, commemorating a single deed of wonder, so to speak, of which all those miraculous incidents were, as we may say, members and parts. But, once more, as regards the circumstance that Matthew has also referred to those who were with the centurion, while the others have left these parties unnoticed, to whom will this not explain itself on the well-understood principle that there is no contradiction necessarily involved in the mere fact that one writer records what another passes by without mention? And, finally, as to Matthew's having told us that \"they feared greatly,\" while Luke has said nothing about the man being afraid, but has informed us that \"he glorified God,\" who can fail to understand that he glorified [God] just by the fear which he exhibited?","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":23,"verse":48,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":23,"source_paragraph":"108","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"58.

For in what way can the truth be affected by the fact that some of these women are named in both lists, while others are referred to only in the one? Luke has likewise connected his narrations as follows: \"And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned. And all His acquaintance and the women that followed Him from Galilee stood afar off beholding these things.\"[fn-25-P2570_1113565:232-nf] Here we perceive that he is quite in harmony with the former two as far as regards the presence of the women, although he does not mention any of them by name. On the subject of the multitude of people who were also present, and who, as they beheld the things which were done, smote their breasts and returned, he is in like manner at one with Matthew, although that evangelist has introduced into the context this distinct statement: \"Now the centurion and they that were with him.\" Thus it simply appears that Luke is the only one who has spoken expressly of His \"acquaintance\" who stood afar off. For John has also noticed the presence of the women before the Lord gave up the ghost. His narrative runs thus: \"Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His mother, and His mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus therefore saw His mother, and the disciple standing by whom He loved, He saith unto His mother, Woman, behold thy son! Then saith He to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.\"[fn-25-P2571_1114669:233-nf] Now, as regards this statement, had not Matthew and Mark at the same time mentioned Mary Magdalene most explicitly by name, it might have been possible for us to say that there was one company of women afar off, and another near the cross. For none of these writers has mentioned the Lord's mother here but John himself. The question, therefore, which rises now is this, How can we understand the same Mary Magdalene both to have stood afar off along with other women, as the accounts of Matthew and Mark bear, and to have been by the cross, as John tells us, unless it be the case that these women were at such a distance as made it quite legitimate to say at once that they were near, because they were at hand there in the sight of Him, and also afar off in comparison with the crowd of people who were standing round about in closer vicinity along with the centurion and the soldiers? It is open for us, then, to suppose that those women who were present at the scene along with the Lord's mother, after He commended her to the disciple, began then to retire with the view of extricating themselves from the dense mass of people, and of looking on at what remained to be done from a greater distance. And in this way the rest of the evangelists, who have introduced their notices of these women only after the Lord's death, have properly reported them to be standing by that time afar off.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":23,"verse":50,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"110","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"59.

And Pilate marvelled if He were already dead: and, calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether He had been any while[fn-25-P2576_1117017:235-nf] dead. And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.\"[fn-25-P2577_1117228:236-nf] Luke's report runs in these terms: \"And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a councillor; and he was a good man, and a just (the same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them): he was of Arimathea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God. This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.\"[fn-25-P2578_1117587:237-nf] John, on the other hand, first narrates the breaking of the legs of those who had been crucified with the Lord, and the piercing of the Lord's side with the lance (which whole passage has been recorded by him alone), and then subjoins a statement which is of the same tenor with what is given by the other evangelists. It proceeds in these terms: \"And after this, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.\"[fn-25-P2579_1118194:238-nf] There is nothing here to give any one of them the appearance of being in antagonism with another. But some one may perhaps ask whether John is not inconsistent with himself, when he at once unites with the rest in telling us how Joseph begged the body of Jesus, and comes forward as the only one who states here that Joseph had been a disciple of Jesus secretly for fear of the Jews. For the question may reasonably be raised as to how it happened that the man who had been a disciple secretly for fear had the courage to beg His body-a thing which not one of those who were His open followers was bold enough to do. We must understand, however, that this man did so in the confidence which his dignified position gave him, the possession of which rendered it possible for him to make his way on familiar terms into Pilate's presence. And we must suppose, further, that in the performance of that last service relating to the interment, he cared less for the Jews, however he tried in ordinary circumstances, when hearing the Lord, to avoid exposing himself to their enmity.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":23,"verse":53,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":25,"source_paragraph":"112","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"60. Matthew proceeds thus: \"And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.\"[fn-25-P2583_1119666:239-nf] Mark's version is as follows: \"And he bought fine linen,[fn-25-P2584_1119751:240-nf] and took Him down, and wrapped Him in the linen, and laid Him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.\"[fn-25-P2585_1120106:241-nf] Luke reports it in those terms: \"And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.\"[fn-25-P2586_1120292:242-nf] So far as these three narratives are concerned, no allegation of a want of harmony can possibly be raised. John, however, tells us that the burial of the Lord was attended to not only by Joseph, but also by Nicodemus. For he begins with Nicodemus in due connection with what precedes, and goes on with his narrative as follows: \"And there came also Nicodemus (which at the first came to Jesus by night), and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.\"[fn-25-P2587_1120793:243-nf] Then, introducing Joseph again at this point, he continues in these terms: \"Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid. There laid they Jesus, therefore, because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.\"[fn-25-P2588_1121246:244-nf] But there is really as little ground for supposing any discrepancy here as there was in the former case, if we take a correct view of the statement. For those evangelists who have left Nicodemus unnoticed have not affirmed that the Lord was buried by Joseph alone, although he is the only one introduced into their records. Neither does the fact, that these three are all at one in informing us how the Lord was wrapped in the linen cloth by Joseph, preclude us from entertaining the idea that other linen stuffs may have been brought by Nicodemus, and added to what was given by Joseph, so that John may be perfectly correct in his narrative, especially as what he tells us is that the Lord was wrapped not in a linen cloth, but in linen clothes.[fn-25-P2589_1122018:245-nf] At the same time, when we take into account the handkerchief which was used for the head, and the bandages with which the whole body was swathed, and consider that all these were made of linen, we can see how, even although there was really but a single linen cloth [of the kind referred to by the first three evangelists] there, it could still have been stated with the most perfect truth that \"they wound Him in linen clothes.\" For the phrase, linen clothes, is one applied generally to all textures made of flax.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":23,"verse":54,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"120","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"67. Let us now proceed, therefore, to look into the rest of this passage, and see how in other respects these statements are quite consistent with what is given by Matthew. For Luke tells us, with the utmost plainness, that two angels were seen by those women who came to the sepulchre. One of these angels we have understood to be referred to by each of the first two evangelists; that is to say, one of them is noticed by Matthew, namely, the one who was sitting outside upon the stone, and a second by Mark, namely, the one who was sitting within the sepulchre on the right side. But Luke's version of the scene is to the following effect: \"And that day was the preparation, and the Sabbath drew on. And the women which had come with Him from Galilee beheld the sepulchre, and how His body was laid. And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the Sabbath-day, according to the commandment.[fn-26-P2624_1140802:271-nf] Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared.[fn-26-P2625_1141090:272-nf] And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments; and as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen: remember how He spake unto you when He was yet in Galilee, saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. And they remembered His words. And they returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.\"[fn-26-P2626_1141822:273-nf] The question, therefore, is this, how can these angels have been seen sitting each one separately,-namely, one outside upon the stone, according to Matthew, and another within upon the right side, according to Mark,-if Luke's report of the same bears that the two stood beside those women, although the words ascribed to them are similar? Well, it is still possible for us to suppose that one angel was seen by the women in the position assigned by Matthew, and in the circumstances indicated by Mark, as we have already explained. In this way, we may understand the said women to have entered into the sepulchre, that is to say, into a certain space which had been fenced off within a kind of enclosure, in such a manner that an entrance might be said to be made when they came in front of the rocky place in which the sepulchre was constructed; and there we may take them to have beheld the angel sitting upon the stone which had been rolled away from the tomb, as Matthew tells us, or in other words, the angel sitting on the right side, as Mark expresses it.[fn-26-P2627_1142995:274-nf] And then we may further surmise that the said women, after they had gone within, and when they were looking at the place where the body of the Lord lay, saw other two angels standing, as Luke informs us, by whom they were addressed in similar terms, with a view to animate their minds and edify their faith.[fn-26-P2628_1143510:275-nf] ","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":23,"verse":43,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_24_book_ii_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"138","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"96.

Just as in the case of the thief on the cross, who confessed but was not baptized, the Lord did not give him the kingdom of heaven, but paradise;[fn-46-P4672_1803540:16-nf] the words remaining accordingly in full force, `Except a man be born again of water and of the Holy Ghost, he shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.'[fn-46-P4673_1803716:17-nf] This is especially true, inasmuch as the Lord acknowledges that in His Father's house are many mansions,[fn-46-P4674_1803839:18-nf] by which are indicated the many different merits of those who dwell in them; so that in these abodes the unbaptized is brought to forgiveness, and the baptized to the reward which by grace has been prepared for him.\" You observe how the man keeps paradise and the mansions of the Father's house distinct from the kingdom of heaven, so that even unbaptized persons may have an abundant provision in places of eternal happiness. Nor does he see, when he says all this, that he is so unwilling to distinguish the future abode of a baptized infant from the kingdom of heaven as to have no fear in keeping distinct therefrom the very house of God the Father, or the several parts thereof. For the Lord Jesus did not say: In all the created universe, or in any portion of that universe, but, \"In my Father's house, are many mansions.\" But in what way shall an unbaptized person live in the house of God the Father, when he cannot possibly have God for his Father, except he be born again? He should not be so ungrateful to God, who has vouchsafed to deliver him from the sect of the Donatists or Rogatists, as to aim at dividing the house of God the Father, and to put one portion of it outside the kingdom of heaven, where the unbaptized may be able to dwell. And on what terms does he himself presume that he is to enter into the kingdom of heaven, when from that kingdom he excludes the house of the King Himself, in what part soever He pleases? From the case, however, of the thief who, when crucified at the Lord's side, put his hope in the Lord who was crucified with him, and from the case of Dinocrates, the brother of St. Perpetua, he argues that even to the unbaptized may be given the remission of sins and an abode with the blessed; as if any one unbelief in whom would be a sin, had shown him that the thief and Dinocrates had not been baptized.

In Tamar, then, the daughter-in-law of Judah, we see the people of the kingdom of Judah, whose kings, answering to Tamar's husbands, were taken from this tribe. Tamar means bitterness; and the meaning is suitable, for this people gave the cup of gall to the Lord.[fn-22-P2255_1361517:153-nf] The two sons of Judah represent two classes of kings who governed ill-those who did harm and those who did no good. One of these sons was evil or cruel before the Lord; the other spilled the seed on the ground that Tamar might not become a mother. There are only those two kinds of useless people in the world-the injurious and those who will not give the good they have but lose it or spill it on the ground. And as injury is worse than not doing good, the evil-doer is called the elder and the other the younger. Er, the name of the elder, means a preparer of skins, which were the coats given to our first parents when they were punished with expulsion from paradise.[fn-22-P2256_1362212:154-nf] Onan, the name of the younger, means, their grief; that is, the grief of those to whom he does no good, wasting the good he has on the earth. The loss of life implied in the name of the elder is a greater evil than the want of help implied in the name of the younger. Both being killed by God typifies the removal of the kingdom from men of this character. The meaning of the third son of Judah not being joined to the woman, is that for a time the kings of Judah were not of that tribe. So this third son did not become the husband of Tamar; as Tamar represents the tribe of Judah, which continued to exist, although the people received no king from it. Hence the name of this son, Selom, means, his dismission. None of those types apply to the holy and righteous men who, like David, though they lived in those times, belong properly to the New Testament, which they served by their enlightened predictions. Again, in the time when Judah ceased to have a king of its own tribe, the elder Herod does not count as one of the kings typified by the husbands of Tamar; for he was a foreigner, and his union with the people was never consecrated with the holy oil. His was the power of a stranger, given him by the Romans and by Caesar. And it was the same with his sons, the tetrarchs, one of whom, called Herod, like his father, agreed with Pilate at the time of the Lord's passion.[fn-22-P2257_1363614:155-nf] So plainly were these foreigners considered as distinct from the sacred monarchy of Judah, that the Jews themselves, when raging against Christ, exclaimed openly, \"We have no king but Caesar.\"[fn-22-P2258_1363830:156-nf] Nor was Caesar properly their king, except in the sense that all the world was subject to Rome.

You say it is because he who continually made war upon the Church has taken refuge within it. Yet surely we ought in the highest degree to glorify God, for permitting him to be placed in such a great strait as to experience both the power and the lovingkindness of the Church:-her power in that he has suffered this great-vicissitude in consequence of the attacks which he made upon her: her lovingkindness in that she whom he attacked now casts her shield in front of him and has received him under her wings, and placed him in all security not resenting any of her former injuries, but most lovingly opening her bosom to him. For this is more glorious than any kind of trophy, this is a brilliant victory, this puts both Gentiles and Jews to shame, this displays the bright aspect of the Church: in that having received her enemy as a captive, she spares him, and when all have despised him in his desolation, she alone like an affectionate mother has concealed him under her cloak,[fn-12-P1228_938569:4-nf] opposing both the wrath of the king, and the rage of the people, and their overwhelming hatred. This is an ornament for the altar. A strange kind of ornament, you say, when the accused sinner, the extortioner, the robber is permitted to lay hold of the altar. Nay! say not so: for even the harlot took hold of the feet of Jesus, she who was stained with the most accursed and unclean sin: yet her deed was no reproach to Jesus, but rather redounded to His admiration and praise: for the impure woman did no injury to Him who was pure, but rather was the vile harlot rendered pure by the touch of Him who was the pure and spotless one. Grudge not then, O man. We are the servants of the crucified one who said \"Forgive them for they know not what they do.\"[fn-12-P1229_939425:5-nf] But, you say, he cut off the right of refuge here by his ordinances and divers kinds of laws. Yes! yet now he has learned by experience what it was he did, and he himself by his own deeds has been the first to break the law, and has become a spectacle to the whole world, and silent though he is, he utters from thence a warning voice to all, saying \"do not such things as I have done, that ye suffer not such things as I suffer.\" He appears as a teacher by means of his calamity, and the altar emits great lustre, inspiring now the greatest awe from the fact that it holds the lion in bondage; for any figure of royalty might be very much set off if the king were not only to be seen seated on his throne arrayed in purple and wearing his crown, but if also prostrate at the feet of the king barbarians with their hands bound behind their backs were bending low their heads.

But we must not speak in a mere cursory way of the partition and dividing by lot of His garments. For although all the four evangelists make mention thereof, yet the others do so more briefly than John: and their notice of it is obscure, while his is in the plainest manner possible. For Matthew says, \"And after they crucified Him, they parted His garments, casting lots.\"[fn-37-P3749_2064267:1-nf] Mark: \"And they crucified Him, and parted His garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.\"[fn-37-P3750_2064396:2-nf] Luke: \"And they parted His raiment, and cast lots.\"[fn-37-P3751_2064464:3-nf] But John has told us also how many parts they made of His garments, namely, four, that they might take one part apiece. From which it, is apparent that there were four soldiers, who obeyed the governor's orders in crucifying Him. For he plainly says: \"Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Him, took His garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and likewise the coat,\" where there is understood, they took: so that the meaning is, they took His garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and they took also His coat. And he so spake, that we might see that there was no lot cast on His other garments; but His coat, whichthey took along with the others, they did not similarly divide. For in regard to it he proceeds to explain, \"Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.\" And then telling us why they cast lots on it, he says, \"They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be.\" Hence it is clear that in the case of the other garments they had equal parts, so that there was no need to cast lots: but that as regards this one, they could not have had a part each without rending it, and thereby possessing themselves only of useless fragments of it; to prevent which, they preferred letting it come to one of them by lot. The account given by this evangelist is also in harmony with the testimony of prophecy, which he likewise immediately subjoins, saying, \"That the scripture might be fulfilled which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots.\" For He says not, they cast lots, but \"they parted:\" nor does He say, casting lots they parted; but while making no mention whatever of the lot in regard to the rest of the garments, He afterwards said, \"and for my vesture they did cast lots,\" in reference solely to the coat that remained. On which I shall speak as He Himself enables me, after I have first refuted the calumny, which may possibly arise, as if the evangelists disagreed with one another, by showing that the words of none of the others are inconsistent with the narrative of John.","title":"Tractate CXVIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":23,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_31_the_pearl_seven_hymns_on_the_faith","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"113","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"7.

He does not wish, but he foresees, it is a prophecy of one who is telling things to come, not a vow of malediction; for the prophets knew by the Spirit to whom evil was appointed to happen, and to whom good; and by prophecy they spake as if they wished for what they did foresee.

He was before violent, and then thou hatedst him.

Then there is the Paraclete or Comforter, also, which He promises to pray for to the Father, and to send from heaven after He had ascended to the Father. He is called \"another Comforter,\" indeed;[fn-107-P10797_3029721:345-nf] but in what way He is another we have already shown,[fn-107-P10798_3029795:346-nf] \"He shall receive of mine,\" says Christ,[fn-107-P10799_3029863:347-nf] just as Christ Himself received of the Father's. Thus the connection of the Father in the Son, and of the Son in the Paraclete, produces three coherent Persons, who are yet distinct One from Another. These Three are, one[fn-108-P10800_3030105:348-nf] essence, not one Person,[fn-108-P10801_3030189:349-nf] as it is said, \"I and my Father are One,\"[fn-108-P10802_3030244:350-nf] in respect of unity of substance not singularity of number.

Now that all the restraint of His humiliation is taken away, He might, if possible, have shown Himself as the Father to so faithful a woman (as Mary Magdalene) when she approached to touch Him, out of love, not from curiosity, nor with Thomas' incredulity. But not so; Jesus saith unto her, \"Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren\" (and even in this He proves Himself to be the Son; for if He had been the Father, He would have called them His children, (instead of His brethren), \"and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.\"[fn-108-P10808_3031793:356-nf] Now, does this mean, I ascend as the Father to the Father, and as God to God?

I will not here largely use the support of the other Gospels, which confirm our belief by the Lord's nativity: it is sufficient to remark that He who had to be born of a virgin is announced in express terms by the angel himself as the Son of God: \"The Spirit of God shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also the Holy Thing that shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\"[fn-108-P10814_3033851:359-nf] On this passage even they will wish to raise a cavil; but truth will prevail. Of course, they say, the Son of God is God, and the power of the highest is the Most High. And they do not hesitate to insinuate[fn-108-P10815_3034077:360-nf] what, if it had been true, would have been written. Whom was he[fn-108-P10816_3034156:361-nf] so afraid of as not plainly to declare, \"God shall come upon thee, and the Highest shall overshadow thee? \"Now, by saying \"the Spirit of God\" (although the Spirit of God is God, ) and by not directly naming God, he wished that portion[fn-108-P10817_3034435:362-nf] of the whole Godhead to be understood, which was about to retire into the designation of \"the Son.\" The Spirit of God in this passage must be the same as the Word. For just as, when John says, \"The Word was made flesh,\"[fn-108-P10818_3034811:363-nf] we understand the Spirit also in the mention of the Word: so here, too, we acknowledge the Word likewise in the name of the Spirit. For both the Spirit is the substance of the Word, and the Word is the operation of the Spirit, and the Two are One (and the same).[fn-108-P10819_3035093:364-nf] Now John must mean One when he speaks of Him as \"having been made flesh,\" and the angel Another when he announces Him as \"about to be born,\" if the Spirit is not the Word, and the Word the Spirit. For just as the Word of God is not actually He whose Word He is, so also the Spirit (although He is called God) is not actually He whose Spirit He is said to be. Nothing which belongs to something else is actually the very same thing as that to which it belongs. Clearly, when anything proceeds from a personal subject,[fn-108-P10820_3035989:365-nf] and so belongs to him, since it comes from him, it may possibly be such in quality exactly as the personal subject himself is from whom it proceeds, and to whom it belongs. And thus the Spirit is God, and the Word is God, because proceeding from God, but yet is not actually the very same as He from whom He proceeds. Now that which is God of God, although He is an actually existing thing,[fn-108-P10821_3036396:366-nf] yet He cannot be God Himself[fn-108-P10822_3036449:367-nf] (exclusively), but so far God as He is of the same substance as God Himself, and as being an actually existing thing, and as a portion of the Whole. Much more will \"the power of the Highest\" not be the Highest Himself, because It is not an actually existing thing, as being Spirit-in the same way as the wisdom (of God) and the providence (of God) is not God: these attributes are not substances, but the accidents of the particular substance. Power is incidental to the Spirit, but cannot itself be the Spirit. These things, therefore, whatsoever they are-(I mean) the Spirit of God, and the Word and the Power-having been conferred on the Virgin, that which is born of her is the Son of God. This He Himself, in those other Gospels also, testifies Himself to have been from His very boyhood: \"Wist ye not,\" says He, \"that I must be about my Father's business? \"[fn-108-P10823_3037397:368-nf] Satan likewise knew Him to be this in his temptations: \"Since Thou art the Son of God.\"[fn-108-P10824_3037505:369-nf] This, accordingly, the devils also acknowledge Him to be: \"we know Thee, who Thou art, the Holy Son of God.\"[fn-108-P10825_3037637:370-nf] His \"Father\" He Himself adores.[fn-108-P10826_3037704:371-nf] When acknowledged by Peter as the \"Christ (the Son) of God,\"[fn-108-P10827_3037815:372-nf] He does not deny the relation.

For it is written that when Korah and his companions made a schism against Moses,\nthe earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up, and they went down alive into Sheol.[fn-46-P4671_1574238:35-nf] Therefore that was the mouth of Sheol that was\nopened in the wilderness.

So the sun is a luminary\nset in the heaven, yet for every place to which its rays extend, its authority suffices, whether on\nsea or on land.

Now, we should be the last to grudge to any human being that God should have compassion on him, and bring him out of perdition to salvation. At the same time, we should acknowledge in such a case the clemency shown in this act of compassion, and not the merit of the person whose life is undeniably blameworthy. Thus, in the case of the Jewish fathers, Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, who are mentioned by Christ in this verse, supposing it to be genuine, although they led wicked lives, as we may learn from their descendant Moses, or whoever was the author of the history called Genesis, which describes their conduct as having been most shocking and detestable we are ready to allow that they may, after all, be in the kingdom of heaven, in the place which they neither believed in, nor hoped for, as is plain enough from their books. But then it must be kept in mind that, as you yourselves confess, if they did attain to what is spoken of in this verse, it was something very different from the nether dungeons of woe to which their own deserts consigned them, and that their deliverance was the work of our Lord Christ, and the result of His mystic passion. Who would grudge to the thief on the cross that deliverance was granted to him by the same Lord, and that Christ said that on that very day he should be with Him in the paradise of His Father?[fn-25-P2540_1535644:2-nf] Who is so hard-hearted as to disapprove of this act of benevolence? Still, it does not follow that, because Jesus pardoned a thief, we must approve of the habits and practices of thieves; any more than of the publicans and harlots, whose faults Jesus pardoned, declaring that they would go into the kingdom of heaven before those who behaved proudly.[fn-25-P2541_1536014:3-nf] For, when He acquitted the woman accused by the Jews as sinful, and as having been caught in adultery, He told her to sin no more.[fn-25-P2542_1536163:4-nf] If, then, He has done something of the same kind in the case of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, all the praise is His; for such actions towards souls are becoming in Him who maketh His sun to rise upon the evil and upon the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.[fn-25-P2543_1536459:5-nf] One thing perplexes me in your doctrine: why you limit your statements to the fathers of the Jews, and are not of opinion that the Gentile patriarchs had also a share in this grace of our Redeemer; especially as the Christian Church consists of their children more than of the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. You will say that the Gentiles worshipped idols, and the Jews the Almighty God, and that therefore Jesus had regard only to the Jews. It would seem from this that the worship of the Almighty God is the sure way to hell, and that the Son must come to the aid of the worshipper of the Father. That is as you please.

But haply both to thy friend the life thou wishest him is not for his good, and to thine enemy the death thou rejoicest at hath been for his good. It is uncertain whether this present life be profitable to any man or unprofitable: but the life which is with God without doubt is profitable.

At first they shed it while they raged; now they drank it while they believed. \"In this we know that we are in Him, if in Him we be made perfect.\" Touching the very perfection of love of enemies, the Lord admonishing, saith, \"Be yetherefore perfect, as your Heavenly Father is perfect.[fn-40-P4015_2209827:50-nf] He,\" therefore, \"that saith he abideth in Him, ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked.\"[fn-40-P4016_2209943:51-nf] How, brethren what cloth he advise us? \"He that saith he abideth in Him,\" i.e., in Christ, \"ought himself also so to walk even as He walked.\" Haply the advice is this, that we should walk on the sea?

The Lord, after His resurrection, what question put He to Peter, but, \"Lovest thou me?\"[fn-42-P4293_2331483:11-nf] And it was not enough to ask it once; a second time also He put none other question, a third time also none other. Although when it came to the third time, Peter, as one who knew not what was the drift of this, was grieved because it seemed as if the Lord did not believe him; nevertheless both a first time and a second, and a third He put this question. Thrice fear denied, thrice love confessed. Behold Peter loveth the Lord. What is he to do for the Lord? For think not that he in the Psalm did not feel himself at a loss what to do: \"What shall I render unto the Lord for all the benefits He hath done unto me?\"[fn-42-P4294_2332122:12-nf] He that said this in the Psalm, marked what great things had been done for him by God; and sought what he should render to God, and could find nothing. For whatever thou wouldest render, from Him didst thou receiveit to render. And what did he find to offer in return? That which, as we said, my brethren, he had received from Him, that only found he to offer in return. \"I will receive the cup of salvation, and will call upon the name of the Lord.\" For who had given him the cup of salvation, but He to whom he wished to offer in return?Now to receive the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord, is to be filled with charity; andso filled, that not only thou shall not hate thy brother, but shall be prepared to die for thy brother. This is perfect charity, that thou be prepared to die for thy brother. This the Lord exhibited in Himself, who died for all, praying for them by whom He was crucified, and saying, \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.\"[fn-42-P4295_2333130:13-nf] But if He alone hath done this, He was not a Master, if He had no disciples. Disciples who came after Him have done this.[fn-42-P4296_2333273:14-nf] Men were stoning Stephen, and he knelt down and said, \"Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.\"[fn-42-P4297_2333396:15-nf] He loved them that were killing him; since for them also he was dying.

What, then, do they venture to say, when their mouth is closed[fn-31-P3169_1846030:1-nf] by the force of truth, with which they will not agree? \"Cyprian,\" say they, \"whose great merits and vast learning we all know, decreed in a Council,[fn-31-P3170_1846196:2-nf] with many of his fellow-bishops contributing their several opinions, that all heretics and schismatics, that is, all who are severed from the communion of the one Church, are without baptism; and therefore, whosoever has joined the communion of the Church after being baptized by them must be baptized in the Church.\" The authority of Cyprian does not alarm me, because I am reassured by his humility. We know, indeed, the great merit of the bishop and martyr Cyprian; but is it in any way greater than that of the apostle and martyr Peter, of whom the said Cyprian speaks as follows in his epistle to Quintus? \"For neither did Peter, whom the Lord chose first, and on whom He built His Church,[fn-31-P3171_1847108:3-nf] when Paul afterwards disputed with him about circumcision, claim or assume anything insolently and arrogantly to himself, so as to say that he held the primacy, and should rather be obeyed of those who were late and newly come. Nor did he despise Paul because he had before been a persecutor of the Church, but he admitted the counsel of truth, and readily assented to the legitimate grounds which Paul maintained; giving us thereby a pattern of concord and patience, that we should not pertinaciously love our own opinions, but should rather account as our own any true and rightful suggestions of our brethren and colleagues for the common health and weal.\"[fn-31-P3172_1847787:4-nf] Here is a passage in which Cyprian records what we also learn in holy Scripture, that the Apostle Peter, in whom the primacy of the apostles shines with such exceeding grace, was corrected by the later Apostle Paul, when he adopted a custom in the matter of circumcision at variance with the demands of truth. If it was therefore possible for Peter in some point to walk not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, so as to compel the Gentiles to judaize, as Paul writes in that epistle in which he calls God to witness that he does not lie; for he says, \"Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not;\"[fn-31-P3173_1848441:5-nf] and, after this sacred and awful calling of God to witness, he told the whole tale, saying in the course of it, \"But when I saw that they walked not uprightly, according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?\"[fn-31-P3174_1848834:6-nf] -if Peter, I say, could compel the Gentiles to live after the manner of the Jews, contrary to the rule of truth which the Church afterwards held, why might not Cyprian, in opposition to the rule of faith which the whole Church afterwards held, compel heretics and schismatics to be baptized afresh? I suppose that there is no slight to Cyprian in comparing him with Peter in respect to his crown of martyrdom; rather I ought to be afraid lest I am showing disrespect towards Peter. For who can be ignorant that the primacy of his apostleship is to be preferred to any episcopate whatever? But, granting the difference in the dignity of their sees, yet they have the same glory in their martyrdom. And whether it may be the case that the hearts of those who confess and die for the true faith in the unity of charity take precedence of each other in different points, the Lord Himself will know, by the hidden and wondrous dispensation of whose grace the thief hanging on the cross once for all confesses Him, and is sent on the selfsame day to paradise,[fn-31-P3175_1849904:7-nf] while Peter, the follower of our Lord, denies Him thrice, and has his crown postponed:[fn-31-P3176_1850013:8-nf] for us it were rash to form a judgment from the evidence. But if any one were now found compelling a man to becircumcised after the Jewish fashion, as a necessary preliminary for baptism, this would meet with much more general repudiation by mankind, than if a man should be compelled to be baptized again. Wherefore, if Peter, on doing this, is corrected by his later colleague Paul, and is yet preserved by the bond of peace and unity till he is promoted to martyrdom, how much more readily and constantly should we prefer, either to the authority of a single bishop, or to the Council of a single province, the rule that has been established by the statutes of the universal Church? For this same Cyprian, in urging his view of the question, was still anxious to remain in the unity of peace even with those who differed from him on this point, as is shown by his own opening address at the beginning of the very Council which is quoted by the Donatists.

Shew mercy then, as men of merciful hearts; because in loving enemies also, ye love brethren. Think not that John hasgiven no precept concerning love of our enemy, because he has not ceased to speak of brotherly love. Ye love brethren. \"How,\" sayest thou, \"do we love brethren?\" I ask wherefore thou lovest anenemy. Wherefore dost thou love him? That he may be whole in this life? what if it be not expedient for him? That he may be rich? what if by his very riches he shall be blinded? That he may marry a wife? what if he shall have a bitter life of it? That he may have children? what if they shall be bad? Uncertain therefore are these things which thou seemest to wish for thine enemy, in that thou lovest him; they are uncertain. Wish for him that he may have with thee eternal life; wish for him that he may be thy brother: when thou lovest him, thou lovest a brother. For thou lovest in him not what he is, but what thou wishest that he may be. I once said to you, my beloved, if I mistake not: There is a log of timber lying in sight; a good workman has seen the log, not yet planed, just as it was hewn from the forest, he has taken a liking to it, he would make something out of it. For indeed he did not love it to this end that it should always remain thus. In his art he has seen what it shall be, not in his liking what it is; and his liking is for the thing he will make of it, not for the thing it is. So God loved us sinners. We say that God loved sinners: for He saith, \"They that are whole need not the Physician, but they that are sick.\"[fn-45-P4531_2445471:34-nf] Did He love us sinners to the end we should still remain sinners? As timber from the wood our Carpenter saw us, and had in His thoughts the building He would make thereof, not the unwrought timber that it was. So too thou seest thine enemy striving against thee, raging, biting with words, exasperating with contumelies, harassing with hatred: thou hast regard to this in him, that he is a man. Thou seest all these things that are against thee, that they were done by man; and thou seest in him that he was made by God. Now that he was made man, was God's doing: but that be hates thee, is his doing; that he has ill-will at thee, is his doing. And what sayest thou in thy mind? Lord, be merciful to him, forgive him his sins, strike terror into him, changehim. Thou lovest not in him what he is, but what thou wishest him to be. Consequently, when thou lovest an enemy, thou lovest a brother. Wherefore, perfect love is the loving an enemy: which perfect love is in brotherly love. And let no man say that John the apostle has admonished us somewhat less, and the Lord Christ somewhat more. John has admonished us to love the brethren; Christ has admonished us to love even enemies. Mark to what end Christ hath bidden thee to love thine enemies. That they may remain always enemies? If He bade it for this end, that they should remain enemies, thou hatest,[fn-45-P4532_2446850:35-nf] not lovest. Mark how He Himself loved, i.e. because He would not that they should be still the persecutors they were, He said, \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.\"[fn-45-P4533_2447044:36-nf] Whom He willed to be forgiven, them He willed to be changed: whom He willed to be changed, of enemies He deigned to make brethren, and did in truth make them so. He was killed, was buried, rose again, ascended into heaven: sent the Holy Ghost to His disciples: they began with boldness to preach His name, they did miracles in the name of Him that was crucified and slain: those slayers of the Lord saw them; and they who in rage had shed His blood, by believing drank it.","title":"Homily VIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":23,"verse":43,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_55_book_iv_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"75","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"30. That the place of baptism is sometimes supplied by martyrdom is supported by an argument by no means trivial, which the blessed Cyprian adduces[fn-36-P3607_2021632:127-nf] from the thief, to whom, though he was not baptized, it was yet said, \"To-day shall thou be with me in Paradise.\"[fn-36-P3608_2021775:128-nf] On considering which, again and again, I find that not only martyrdom for the sake of Christ may supply what was wanting of baptism, but also faith and conversion of heart, if recourse may not be had to the celebration of the mystery of baptism for want of time.[fn-36-P3609_2022061:129-nf] For neither was that thief crucified for the name of Christ, but as the reward of his own deeds; nor did he suffer because he believed, but he believed while suffering. It was shown, therefore, in the case of that thief, how great is the power, even without the visible sacrament of baptism, of what the apostle says, \"With the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.\"[fn-36-P3610_2022584:130-nf] But the want is supplied invisibly only when the administration of baptism is prevented, not by contempt for religion, but by the necessity of the moment. For much more in the case of Cornelius and his friends, than in the case of that robber, might it seem superfluous that they should also be baptized with water, seeing that in them the gift of the Holy Spirit, which, according to the testimony of holy Scripture, was received by other men only after baptism, had made itself manifest by every unmistakable sign apppropriate to those times when they spoke with tongues. Yet they were baptized, and for this action we have the authority of an apostle as the warrant. So far ought all of us to be from being induced by any imperfection in the inner man, if it so happen that before baptism a person has advanced, through the workings of a pious heart, to spiritual understanding, to despise a sacrament which is applied to the body by the hands of the minister, but which is God's own means for working spiritually a man's dedication to Himself. Nor do I conceive that the function of baptizing was assigned to John, so that it should be called John's baptism, for any other reason except that the Lord Himself, who had appointed it, in not disdaining to receive the baptism of His servant,[fn-36-P3611_2023897:131-nf] might consecrate the path of humility, and show most plainly by such an action how high a value was to be placed on His own baptism, with which He Himself was afterwards to baptize. For He saw, like an excellent physician of eternal salvation, that overweening pride would be found in some, who, having made such progress in the understanding of the truth and in uprightness of character that they would not hesitate to place themselves, both in life and knowledge, above many that were baptized, would think it was unnecessary for them to be baptized, since they felt that they had attained a frame of mind to which many that were baptized were still only endeavoring to raise themselves.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":23,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_50_oration_xxxviii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"26","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"XVIII.

But where the kingdom of God is, there most certainly eternal life is enjoyed, and where the kingdom of the devil is, there without doubt is death and the grave. And the man who is in this condition, cannot praise the Lord, according to the saying of the prophet which tells us: \"The dead cannot praise Thee, O Lord; neither all they that go down into the grave (doubtless of sin). But we,\" says he, \"who live(not forsooth to sin nor I to this world but to God) will bless the Lord, from this time forth for evermore: for in death no man remembereth God: but in the grave (of sin) who will confess to the Lord?\"[fn-35-P3555_1326588:27-nf] i.e., no one will. For no man even though he were to call himself a Christian a thousand times over, or a monk, confesses God when he is sinning: no man who allows those things which the Lord hates, remembereth God, nor calls himself with any truth the servant of Him, whose commands he scorns with obstinate rashness: in which death the blessed Apostle declares that the widow is involved, who gives herself to pleasure, saying \"a widow who giveth herself to pleasure is dead while she liveth.\"[fn-35-P3556_1327115:28-nf] There are then many who while still living in this body are dead, and lying in the grave cannot praise God; and on the contrary there are many who though they are dead in the body yet bless God in the spirit, and praise Him, according to this: \"O ye spirits and souls of the righteous, bless ye the Lord:\"[fn-35-P3557_1327439:29-nf] and \"every spirit shall praise the Lord.\"[fn-35-P3558_1327506:30-nf] And in the Apocalypse the souls of them that are slain are not only said to praise God but to address Him also.[fn-35-P3559_1327634:31-nf] In the gospel too the Lord says with still greater clearness to the Sadducees: \"Have ye not read that which was spoken by God, when He said to you: I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. He is not the God of the dead but of the living: for all do live unto Him.\"[fn-35-P3560_1327951:32-nf] Of whom also the Apostle says: \"wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for He hath prepared for them a city.\"[fn-35-P3561_1328103:33-nf] For that they are not idle after the separation from this body, and are not incapable of feeling, the parable in the gospel shows, which tells us of the beggar Lazarus and Dives clothed in purple, one of whom obtained a position of bliss, i.e., Abraham's bosom, the other is consumed with the dreadful heat of eternal fire.[fn-35-P3562_1328445:34-nf] But if you care too to understand the words spoken to the thief \"To-day thou shalt be with Me in Paradise,\"[fn-35-P3563_1328582:35-nf] what do they clearly show but that not only does their former intelligence continue with the souls, but also that in their changed condition they partake of some state which corresponds to their actions and deserts? For the Lord would certainly never have promised him this, if He had known that his soul after being separated from the flesh would either have been deprived of perception or have been resolved into nothing. For it was not his flesh but his soul which was to enter Paradise with Christ. At least we must avoid, and shunwith the utmost horror, that wicked punctuation of the heretics, who, as they do not believe that Christ could be found in Paradise on the same day on which He descended into hell, thus punctuate \"Verily, I say unto you to-day,\" and making a stop apply \"thou shall be with. Me in Paradise, in such a way that they imagine that this promise was not fulfilled at once after he departed from this life, but that it will be fulfilled after the resurrection,[fn-35-P3564_1329596:36-nf] as they do not understand what before the time of His resurrection He declared to the Jews, who fancied that He was hampered by human difficulties and weakness of the flesh as they were: \"No man hath ascended into heaven, but He who came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven:\"[fn-35-P3565_1330070:37-nf] by which He clearly shows that the souls of the departed are not only not deprived of their reason, but that they are not even without such feelings as hope and sorrow, joy and fear, and that they already are beginning to taste beforehand something of what is reserved for them at the last judgment, and that they are not as some unbelievers hold resolved into nothing after their departure from this life:[fn-35-P3566_1330499:38-nf] but that they live a more real life, and are still more earnest in waiting on the praises of God. And indeed to put aside for a little Scripture proofs, and to discuss, as far as our ability permits us, a little about the nature of the soul itself, is it not beyond the bounds of I will not say the folly, but the madness of all stupidity, even to have the slightest suspicion that the nobler part of man, in which as the blessed Apostle shows, the image and likeness of God consists,[fn-35-P3567_1331546:39-nf] will, when the burden of the body with which it is oppressed in this world is laid aside, become insensible, when, as it contains in itself all the power of reason, it makes the dumb and senseless material flesh sensible, by participation with it: especially when it follows, and the order of reason itself demands that when the mind has put off the grossness of the flesh with which it is now weighed down, it will restore its intellectual powers better than ever, and receive them in a purer and finer condition than it lost them. But so far did the blessed Apostle recognize that what we say is true, that he actually wished to depart from this flesh; that by separation from it, he might be able to be joined more earnestly to the Lord; saying: \"I desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, which is far better, for while we are in the body we are absent from the Lord:\" and therefore \"we are bold and have our desire always to be absent from the body, and present with the Lord. Wherefore also we strive, whether absent or present, to be pleasing to Him;\"[fn-35-P3568_1332647:40-nf] and he declares indeed that the continuance of the soul which is in the flesh is distance from the Lord, and absence from Christ, and trusts with entire faith that its separation and departure from this flesh involves presence with Christ. And again still more clearly the same Apostle speaks of this state of the souls as one that is very full of life: \"But ye are come to Mount Sion, and the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, and the church of the first born, who are written in heaven, and the spirits of just men made perfect.\"[fn-35-P3569_1333265:41-nf] Of which spirits he speaks in another passage, \"Furthermore we have had instructors of our flesh, and we reverenced them: shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live?\"[fn-35-P3570_1333480:42-nf] ","title":"I.

For that He did not say this with reference to the acknowledging of the Stauros (cross) above, as some among them venture to expound, but with respect to the suffering which He should Himself undergo, and that His disciples should endure, He implies when He says, \"For whosoever will save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose, shall find it. And that His disciples must suffer for His sake, He [implied when He] said to the Jews, \"Behold, I send you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify.\"[fn-77-P7766_2120149:344-nf] And to the disciples He was wont to say, \"And ye shall stand before governors and kings for My sake; and they shall scourge some of you, and slay you, and persecute you from city to city.\"[fn-77-P7767_2120362:345-nf] He knew, therefore, both those who should suffer persecution, and He knew those who should have to be scourged and slain because of Him; and He did not speak of any other cross, but of the suffering which He should Himself undergo first, and His disciples afterwards. For this purpose did He give them this exhortation: \"Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to send both soul and body into hell; \"[fn-77-P7768_2120849:346-nf] [thus exhorting them] to hold fast those professions of faith which they had made in reference to Him. For He promised to confess before His Father those who should confess His name before men; but declared that He would deny those who should deny Him, and would be ashamed of those who should be ashamed to confess Him. And although these things are so, some of these men have proceeded to such a degree of temerity, that they even pour contempt upon the martyrs, and vituperate those who are slain on account of the confession of the Lord, and who suffer all things predicted by the Lord, and who in this respect strive to follow the footprints of the Lord's passion, having become martyrs of the suffering One; these we do also enrol with the martyrs themselves. For, when inquisition shall be made for their blood,[fn-77-P7769_2121688:347-nf] and they shall attain to glory, then all shall be confounded by Christ, who have cast a slur upon their martyrdom. And from this fact, that He exclaimed upon the cross, \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do,\"[fn-77-P7770_2121932:348-nf] the long-suffering, patience, compassion, and goodness of Christ are exhibited, since He both suffered, and did Himself exculpate those who had maltreated Him. For the Word of God, who said to us, \"Love your enemies, and pray for those that hate you,\"[fn-77-P7771_2122207:349-nf] Himself did this very thing upon the cross; loving the human race to such a degree, that He even prayed for those putting Him to death. If, however, any one, going upon the supposition that there are two [Christs], forms a judgment in regard to them, that [Christ] shall be found much the better one, and more patient, and the truly good one, who, in the midst of His own wounds and stripes, and the other [cruelties] inflicted upon Him, was beneficent, and unmindful of the wrongs perpetrated upon Him, than he who flew away, and sustained neither injury nor insult.","title":"Book III.","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":23,"verse":48,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_143_the_teaching_of_addaeus_the_apostle_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"ANF-08","text":"Flee, then, from things made and created, as I said to you, which are only called gods in name, whilst they are not gods in their nature; and draw near to this Being, who in His nature is God from everlasting and from eternity, and is not something made, like your idols, nor is He a creature and a work of art, like those images in which ye glory.

For by the Lord so put to death are all we cured, by His Blood redeemed, by the Bread of His Body delivered from famine. This Presence then did Christ exhibit to the Jews.

For in order that He might die for us because the Word could not die, \"The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.\"[fn-43-P4363_1851816:17-nf] He hung upon the Cross, but in the flesh. There was the meanness,[fn-43-P4364_1851899:18-nf] which the Jews despised; there the dearness,[fn-43-P4365_1851958:19-nf] by which the Jews were delivered. For for them was it said, \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.\"[fn-43-P4366_1852088:20-nf] And that voice was not in vain. He died, was buried, rose again, having passed forty days with His disciples, He ascended into heaven, He sent the Holy Ghost on them, who waited for the promise. They were filled with the Holy Ghost, whom they had received, and began to speak with the tongues of all nations. Then the Jews who were present, amazed that unlearned and ignorant men, whom they had known as brought up among them with one tongue, should in the Name of Christ speak in all tongues, were in astonishment, and learnt from Peter's words whence this gift came. He gave it, who hung upon the tree. He gave it, who was derided as He hung upon the tree, that from His seat in heaven He might give the Holy Spirit. They of whom He had said, \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do,\" heard, believed. They believed, were baptized, and their conversion was effected. What conversion? In faith they drank the Blood of Christ, which in fury they had shed.","title":"Sermon XXX. [LXXX.

However, it will be acknowledged cordially by all, that from the date of the resurrection of our Lord, those who up to that time have been humbling their souls with fastings, ought at once to begin their festal joy and gladness. But in what you have written to me you have made out very clearly, and with an intelligent understanding of the Holy Scriptures, that no very exact account seems to be offered in them of the hour at which He rose. For the evangelists have given different descriptions of the parties who came to the sepulchre one after another,[fn-15-P1582_445884:141-nf] and all have declared that they found the Lord risen already. It was \"in the end of the Sabbath,\" as Matthew has said;[fn-15-P1583_446042:142-nf] it was \"early, when it was yet dark,\" as John writes;[fn-15-P1584_446120:143-nf] it was \"very early in the morning,\" as Luke puts it; and it was \"very early in the morning, at the rising of the sun,\" as Mark tells us. Thus no one has shown us clearly the exact time when He rose. It is admitted, however, that those who came to the sepulchre in the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week,[fn-15-P1585_446481:144-nf] found Him no longer lying in it. And let us not suppose that the evangelists disagree or contradict each other. But even although there may seem to be some small difficulty as to the subject of our inquiry, if they all agree that the light of the world, our Lord, rose on that one night, while they differ with respect to the hour, we may well seek with wise and faithful mind to harmonize their statements. The narrative by Matthew then, runs thus: \"In the end of the Sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week,[fn-15-P1586_447058:145-nf] came Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, to see the sepulchre. And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone, and sat upon it. And his countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: and for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men. And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. He is not here; for He is risen, as He said.\"[fn-15-P1587_447611:146-nf] Now this phrase \"in the end\" will be thought by some to signify, according to the common use[fn-15-P1588_447730:147-nf] of the word, the evening: of the Sabbath; while others, with a better perception of the fact, will say that it does not indicate that, but a late hour in the night,[fn-15-P1589_447914:148-nf] as the phrase \"in the end\"[fn-15-P1590_447965:149-nf] denotes slowness and length of time. Also because he speaks of night, and not of evening, he has added the words, \"as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week.\" And the parties here did not come yet, as the others say, \"bearing spices,\" but \"to see the sepulchre; \"and they discovered the occurrence of the earthquake, and the angel sitting upon the stone, and heard from him the declaration, \"He is not here, He is risen.\" And to the same effect is the testimony of John. \"The first day of the week,\" says he, \"came Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.\"[fn-15-P1591_448627:150-nf] Only, according to this \"when it was yet dark,\" she had come in advance.[fn-15-P1592_448719:151-nf] And Luke says: \"They rested the Sabbath-day, according to the commandment. Now, upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared; and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.\"[fn-15-P1593_449025:152-nf] This phrase \"very early in the morning\"[fn-15-P1594_449100:153-nf] probably indicates the early dawn[fn-15-P1595_449157:154-nf] of the first day of the week; and thus, when the Sabbath itself was wholly past, and also the whole night succeeding it, and when another day had begun, they came, bringing spices and myrrh, and then it became apparent that He had already risen long before. And Mark follows this, and says: \"They had bought sweet spices, in order that they might come and anoint Him. And very early (in the morning), the first day of the week, they come unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.\"[fn-15-P1596_449698:155-nf] For this evangelist also has used the term \"very early,\" which is just the same as the \"very early in the morning\" employed by the former; and he has added, \"at the rising of the sun.\" Thus they set out, and took their way first when it was \"very early in the morning,\" or (as Mark says) when it was \"very early; \"but on the road, and by their stay at the sepulchre, they spent the time till it was sunrise. And then the young man clad in white said to them, \"He is risen, He is not here.\" As the case stands thus, we make the following statement and explanation to those who seek an exact account of the specific hour, or half-hour, or quarter of an hour, at which it is proper to begin their rejoicing over our Lord's rising from the dead. Those who are too hasty, and give up even before midnight,[fn-15-P1597_450522:156-nf] we reprehend as remiss and intemperate, and as almost breaking off from their course in their precipitation,[fn-15-P1598_450685:157-nf] for it is a wise man's word, \"That is not little in life which is within a little.\" And those who hold out and continue for a very long time, and persevere even on to the fourth watch, which is also the time at which our Saviour manifested Himself walking upon the sea to those who were then on the deep, we receive as noble and laborious disciples. On those, again, who pause and refresh themselves in the course as they are moved or as they are able, let us not press very hard:[fn-15-P1599_451219:158-nf] for all do not carry out the six days of fasting[fn-16-P1600_451444:159-nf] either equally or alike; but some pass even all the days as a fast, remaining without food through the whole; while others take but two, and others three, and others four, and others not even one. And to those who have laboured painfully through these protracted fasts. and have thereafter become exhausted and well-nigh undone, pardon ought to be extended if they are somewhat precipitate in taking food. But if there are any who not only decline such protracted fasting, but refuse at the first to fast at all, and rather indulge themselves luxuriously during the first four days, and then when they reach the last two days-viz., the preparation and the Sabbath-fast with due rigour during these, and these alone, and think that they do something grand and brilliant if they hold out till the morning, I cannot think that they have gone through the time on equal terms with those who have been practising the same during several days before. This is the counsel which, in accordance with my apprehension of the question, I have offered you in writing on these matters.[fn-16-P1601_452602:160-nf] ","title":"Part I.-Containing Various Sections of the Works.","author":"Dionysius"},{"chapter":23,"verse":29,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_73_xxi_the_first_conference_of_abbot_theonas_","source_chapter":31,"source_paragraph":"129","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Theonas: Your inquiry once more raises before us a question of no small extent.

Then mighty deeds were done by His disciples, but He wrought by them as He wrought by Himself: since, indeed, He had said to them, \"Without me ye can do nothing.\"[fn-14-P1448_911201:11-nf] When that lame man who sat at the gate rose up at Peter's voice, and walked on his feet, so that men marvelled, Peter spoke to them to this effect, that it was not by his own power that he did this, but in the virtue of Him whom they slew.[fn-14-P1449_911458:12-nf] Many pricked in the heart said, \"What shall we do?\" For they saw themselves bound by an immense crime of impiety, since they slew Him whom they ought to have revered and worshipped; and this crime they thought inexpiable. A great wickedness indeed it was, the thought of which might make them despair; yet it did not behove them to despair, for whom the Lord, as He hung on the cross, deigned to pray. For He had said, \"Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.[fn-14-P1450_911953:13-nf] He saw some who were His own among many who were aliens; for these He sought pardon, from whom at the time He was still receiving injury. He regarded not that He was being put to death by them, but only that He was dying for them. It was a great thing that was forgiven them, it was a great thing that was done by them and for them, so that no man should despair of the forgiveness of his sin when they who slew Christ obtained pardon. Christ died for us, but surely He was not put to death by us? But those men indeed saw Christ dying by their own villany; and yet they believed on Christ pardoning their villanies. Until they drank the blood they had shed, they despaired of their own salvation. Therefore said He this: \"Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come;\" because they were to seek Him after the resurrection, being pricked in their heart with remorse. Nor did He say \"where I will be,\" but \"where I am.\" For Christ was always in that place whither He was about to return; for He came in such manner that He did not depart from that place. Hence He says in another place, \"No man has ascended into heaven, but He who came down from heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.\"[fn-14-P1451_913189:14-nf] He said not, who was in heaven. He spoke on the earth, and declared that He was at the same time in heaven. He came in such wise that He departed not thence; and He so returned as not to abandon us. What do ye marvel at? This is God's doing. For man, as regards his body, is in a place, and departs from a place; and when he comes to another place, he will not be in that place whence he came: but God fills all things, and is all everywhere; He is not held in places according to space. Nevertheless the Lord Christ was, as regards His visible flesh, on the earth: as regards His invisible majesty, He was in heaven and on earth; and therefore He says, \"Where I am, thither ye cannot come.\" Nor did He say, \"Ye shall not be able.\" but \"ye are not able to come;\" for at that time they were such as were not able. And that ye may know that this was not said to cause despair, He said something of the same kind also to His disciples: \"Whither I go ye cannot come.\"[fn-14-P1452_914173:15-nf] Yet while praying in their behalf, He said, \"Father, I will that where I am they also may be with me.\"[fn-14-P1453_914296:16-nf] And, finally, this He expounded to Peter, and says to him, \"Whither I go thou canst not follow me now, but thou shalt follow me hereafter.\"[fn-14-P1454_914456:17-nf] ","title":"Tractate XXXI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":23,"verse":34,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_162_letter_clxiv_to_leo_augustus_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"What therefore the unholy parricide has perpetrated by seizing on the holy Church and cruelly murdering its very ruler, cannot be expiated by man's forgiveness, unless He Who alone can rightly punish such things, and alone can of His unspeakable mercy remit them, be propitiated.

Is He not the same of whom we confess that He rose again on the third day, ascended into heaven, there sits at the right hand of the Father, and thence shall come to judge the quick and the dead? Is not this our faith of which the apostle says, \"With the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation?\"[fn-15-P1580_995595:2-nf] When, therefore, we confess these things, do we contradict the Lord? We say that He shall come a judge of the quick and the dead, whilst He says Himself, \"I judge not any man.\" This question maybe solved in two ways: Either that we may understand this expression, \"I judge not any man,\" to mean, I judge not any man now; in accordance with what He says in another place, \"I am not come to judge the world, But to save the world;\" not denying His judgment here, but deferring it. Or, otherwise, surely that when He said, \"Ye judge after the flesh,\" He subjoined, \"I judge not any man,\" in such manner that thou shouldst understand \"after the flesh\" to complete the sense. Therefore let no scruple of doubt remain in our heart against the faith which we hold and declare concerning Christ as judge. Christ is come, but first to save, then to judge: to adjudge to punishment those who would not be saved; to bring them to life who, by believing, did not reject salvation. Accordingly, the first dispensation of our Lord Jesus Christ is medicinal, not judicial; for if He had come to judge first, He would have found none on whom He might bestow the rewards of righteousness. Because, therefore, He saw that all were sinners, and that none was exempt from the death of sin, His mercy had first to be craved, and afterwards His judgmentmust be executed; for of Him the psalm had sung, \"Mercy and judgment will I sin to Thee, O Lord.\"[fn-15-P1581_997039:3-nf] Now, He says not judgment and mercy,\" for if judgment had been first, there would be no mercy; but it is mercy first, then judgment. What is the mercy first? The Creator of man deigned to become man; was made what He had made, that the creature He had made might not perish. What can be added to this mercy? And yet He has added thereto. It was not enough for Him to be made man, He added to this that He was rejected of men; it was not enough to be rejected, He was dishonored; it was not enough to be dishonored, He was put to death; but even this was not enough, it was by the death of the cross. For when the apostle was commending to us His obedience even unto death, it was not enough for him to say, \"He became obedient unto death;\" for it was not unto death of any kind whatever: but he added, \"even the death of the cross.\"[fn-15-P1582_997886:4-nf] Among all kinds of death, there was nothing worse than that death. In short, that wherein one is racked by the most intense pains is called cruciatus, which takes its name from crux, a cross. For the crucified, hanging on the tree, nailed to the wood, were killed by a slow lingering death. To be crucified was not merely to be put to death; for the victim lived long on the cross, not because longer life was chosen, but because death itself was stretched out that the pain might not be too quickly ended. He willed to die for us, yet it is not enough to say this; He deigned to be crucified, became obedient even to the death of the cross. He who was about to take away all death, chose the lowest and worst kind of death: He slew death by the worst of deaths. To the Jews who understood not, it was indeed the worst of deaths, but it was chosen by the Lord. For He was to have that very cross as His sign; that very cross, a trophy, as it were, over the vanquished devil, He was to put on the brow of believers, so that the apostle said, \"God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.\"[fn-15-P1583_999080:5-nf] Nothing was then more intolerable in the flesh, nothing is now more glorious on the brow. What does He reserve for His faithful one, when He has put such honor on the instrument of His own torture? Now is the cross no longer used among the Romans in the punishment of criminals, for where the cross of the Lord came to be honored, it was thought that even a guilty man would be honored if he should be crucified. Hence, He who came for this cause judged no man: He suffered also the wicked. He suffered unjust judgment, that He might execute righteous judgment. But it was of His mercy that He endured unjust judgment. In short, He became so low as to come to the cross; yea, laid aside His power, but published His mercy. Wherein did He lay aside His power? In that He would not come down from the cross, though He had the power to rise again from the sepulchre. Wherein did He publish His mercy? In that, when hanging on the cross, He said, \"Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.\"[fn-15-P1584_1000096:6-nf] Whether, then, it be that He said, \"I judge not any man,\" because He had come not to judge the world, out to save the world; or, that, as I have mentioned, when He had said, \"Ye judge after the flesh,\" He added, \"I judge not any man,\" for us to understand that Christ judgeth not after the flesh, like as He was judged by men.","title":"Tractate XXXVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":23,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_41_tractate_xxxvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"10. He had spoken of judgment; He means to speak of testimony. \"In your law,\" saith He, \"it is written that the testimony of two men is true. I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.\" He expounded the law to them also, if they were not unthankful. For it is a great question, my brethren, and to me it certainly appears to have been ordained in a mystery, where God said, \"In the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall stand.\"[fn-15-P1594_1012898:10-nf] Is truth sought by two witnesses? Clearly it is; so is the custom of mankind: but yet it may be that even two witnesses lie. The chaste Susanna was pressed by two false witnesses: were they not therefore false because they were two? Do we speak of two or of three? A whole people lied against Christ.[fn-15-P1595_1013236:11-nf] If, then, a people, consisting of a great multitude of men, was found a false witness, how is it to be understood that \"in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall stand,\" unless it be that in this manner the Trinity is mysteriously set forth to us, in which is perpetual stability of truth? Dost thou wish to have a good cause? Have two or three witnesses,-the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. In short, when Susanna, the chaste woman and faithful wife, was pressed by two false witnesses, the Trinity supported her in her conscience and in secret: that Trinity raised up from secrecy one witness, Daniel, and convicted the two?

Let us sift each of the three questions I have suggested, and choose that which conforms to the standard of truth. For if we say that the Word of God laid down His soul, and took it again, we should have to fear the entrance of a wicked thought, and have it said to us: Then there was a time when that soul was separated from the Word, and a time, after His assumption of that soul, when He was without a soul. I see, indeed, that the Word was once without a human soul, but only so, when \"in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\" But from the time that the Word was made flesh, to dwell amongst us,[fn-20-P2042_1264640:27-nf] and manhood was assumed by the Word, that is, our whole nature, soul and flesh, what more could His passion and death do than separate the body from the soul? It separated not the soul from the Word. For if the Lord died, yea, because He died (for He did so for us on the cross), doubtless His flesh breathed out that which was its life: for a short time the soul forsook the flesh, although destined by its own return to raise the flesh again to life. But I cannot say that the soul was separated from the Word. He said to the soul of the thief, \"To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.\"[fn-20-P2043_1265252:28-nf] He forsook not the believing soul of the robber, and did He abandon His own? Surely not; but when the Lord took that of the other into His keeping, He certainly retained His own in indissoluble union. If, on the other hand, we say that the soul laid down and reassumed itself, we fall into the greatest absurdity; for what was not separated from the Word, was inseparable from itself.","title":"Tractate XLVII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":23,"verse":43,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_76_letter_v_for_333_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"3.

But what follows? \"For the poor ye have always with you, but me ye will not have always.\" We can certainly understand, \"thepoor ye have always;\" what He has thus said is true. When were the poor wanting in the Church? \"But me ye will not have always;\" what does He mean by this? How are we to understand, \"Me ye will not have always\"? Don't be alarmed: it was addressed to Judas. Why, then, did He not say, thou wilt have, but, ye will have? Because Judas is not here a unit. One wicked man represents the whole body of the wicked; in the same way as Peter, the whole body of the good, yea, the body of the Church, but in respect to the good. For if in Peter's case there were no sacramental symbol of the Church, the Lord would not have said to him, \"I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: whatsoever thou shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven.\"[fn-22-P2208_1358070:17-nf] If this was said only to Peter, it gives no ground of action to the Church. But if such is the case also in the Church, that what is bound on earth is bound in heaven, and what is loosed on earth is loosed in heaven,-for when the Church excommunicates, the excommunicated person is bound in heaven; when one is reconciled by the Church, the person so reconciled is loosed in heaven:-if such, then, is the case in the Church, Peter, in receiving the keys, represented the holy Church.

It is truly a subject of joy, that we can see the signs of victory against death, even our own incorruptibility, through the body of the Lord.

There, Moses smote down with the sword those who had set up the calf;[fn-38-P3818_1073338:534-nf] and here, the Lord Jesus said, \"I came to send a sword upon the earth, and to set a man at variance with his neighbour,\"[fn-38-P3819_1073477:535-nf] and so on.

For if the cruel and proud foe could have known the counsel of God's mercy, he would have aimed at soothing the Jews' minds into gentleness rather than at firing them with unrighteous hatred, lest be should lose the thraldom of all his captives in assailing the liberty of One Who owed him nought. Thus he was foiled by his malice: he inflicted a punishment on the Son of God, which was turned to the healing of all the sons of men. He shed righteous Blood, which became the ransom and the drink for the world's atonement. The Lord undertook that which He chose according to the purpose of His own will. He permitted madmen to lay their wicked hands upon Him: hands which, in ministering to their own doom, were of service to the Redeemer's work. And yet so great was His loving compassion for even His murderers, that He prayed to the Father on the cross, and begged not for His own vengeance but for their forgiveness, saying, \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do[fn-36-P3698_932620:5-nf] .\" And such was the power of that prayer, that the hearts of many of those who had said, \"His blood be on us and on our sons[fn-36-P3699_932767:6-nf] ,\" were turned to penitence by the Apostle Peter's preaching, and on one day there were baptized about 3,000 Jews: and they all were \"of one heart and of one soul[fn-37-P3700_932953:7-nf] ,\" being ready now to die for Him, Whose crucifixion they had demanded.","title":"Sermon LXII.

Moreover, it is not those who judge better that wish to be separated, but they wish to stay with them, and to profit them by the exposition of better things; and therefore the unbelievers, not wishing to hearken to them, make war against them, banishing, persecuting, hating them. But those who suffer these things, pitying those who are ensnared by ignorance, by the teaching of wisdom pray for those who contrive evil against them, having learned that ignorance is the cause of their sin.
