{"verses":["A psalm for David.  The Lord said to my Lord:  Sit thou at my\nright hand:  Until I make thy enemies thy footstool.","The Lord will send forth the sceptre of thy power out of Sion:\nrule thou in the midst of thy enemies.","With thee is the principality in the day of thy strength:  in the\nbrightness of the saints:  from the womb before the day star I begot\nthee.","The Lord hath sworn, and he will not repent:  Thou art a priest\nfor ever according to the order of Melchisedech.","The Lord at thy right hand hath broken kings in the day of his\nwrath.","He shall judge among nations, he shall fill ruins:  he shall\ncrush the heads in the land of many.","He shall drink of the torrent in the way:  therefore shall he\nlift up the head."]}
