Against such parties it is said, \"If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ;\"[fn-3-P314_69052:66-nf] and, by the prophet, \"They who please men are put to shame, because God hath despised them;\" and again, \"God hath broken the bones of those who please men;\"[fn-3-P315_69226:67-nf] and again the apostle, \"Let us not be desirous of vainglory;\"[fn-3-P316_69306:68-nf] and still another time, \"But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.\"[fn-3-P317_69458:69-nf] Hence our Lord has not said merely, \"that they may see your good works,\" but has added, \"and glorify your Father who is in heaven:\" so that the mere fact that a man by means of good works pleases men, does not there set it up as an end that he should please men; but let him subordinate this to the praise of God, and for this reason please men, that God may be glorified in him. For this is expedient for them who offer praise, that they should honour, not man, but God; as our Lord showed in the case of the man who was carried, where, on the paralytic being healed, the multitude, marvelling at His powers, as it is written in the Gospel, \"feared and glorified God, which had given such power unto men.\"[fn-3-P318_70183:70-nf] And His imitator, the Apostle Paul, says, \"But they had heard only, that he which persecuted us intimes past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed; and they glorified[fn-3-P319_70379:71-nf] God in me.\"","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":53,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"340","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"27. You must also be careful to avoid the snare of a passion for vainglory. \"How,\" Jesus says, \"can ye believe which receive glory one from another?\"[fn-8-P835_168504:549-nf] What an evil that must be the victim of which cannot believe! Let us rather say: \"Thou art my glorying,\"[fn-8-P836_168633:550-nf] and \"He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord,\"[fn-8-P837_168704:551-nf] and \"If I yet pleased men I should not be the servant of Christ,\"[fn-8-P838_168791:552-nf] and \"Far be it from me to glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world hath been crucified unto me and I unto the world;\"[fn-8-P839_168960:553-nf] and once more: \"In God we boast all the day long; my soul shall make her boast in the Lord.\"[fn-8-P840_169084:554-nf] When you do alms, let God alone see you. When you fast, be of a cheerful countenance.[fn-8-P841_169206:555-nf] Let your dress be neither too neat nor too slovenly; neither let it be so remarkable as to draw the attention of passers-by, and to make men point their fingers at you. Is a brother dead? Has the body of a sister to be carried to its burial? Take care lest in too often performing such offices you die yourself. Do not wish to seem very devout nor more humble than need be, lest you seek glory by shunning it. For many, who screen from all men's sight their poverty, charity, and fasting, desire to excite admiration by their very disdain of it, and strangely seek for praise while they profess to keep out of its way. From the other disturbing influences which make men rejoice, despond, hope, and fear I find many free; but this is a defect which few are without, and he is best whose character, like a fair skin, is disfigured by the fewest blemishes. I do not think it necessary to warn you against boasting of your riches, or against priding yourself on your birth, or against setting yourself up as superior to others. I know your humility; I know that you can say with sincerity: \"Lord, my heart is not haughty nor mine eyes lofty;\"[fn-8-P842_170383:556-nf] I know that in your breast as in that of your mother the pride through which the devil fell has no place. It would be time wasted to write to you about it; for there is no greater folly than to teach a pupil what he knows already. But now that you have despised the boastfulness of the world, do not let the fact inspire you with new boastfulness. Harbor not the secret thought that having ceased to court attention in garments of gold you may begin to do so in mean attire. And when you come into a room full of brothers and sisters, do not sit in too low a place or plead that you are unworthy of a footstool. Do not deliberately lower your voice as though worn out with fasting; nor, leaning on the shoulder of another, mimic the tottering gait of one who is faint. Some women, it is true, disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast.[fn-8-P843_171260:557-nf] As soon as they catch sight of any one they groan, they look down; they cover up their faces, all but one eye, which they keep free to see with. Their dress is sombre, their girdles are of sackcloth, their hands and feet are dirty; only their stomachs-which cannot be seen-are hot with food. Of these the psalm is sung daily: \"The Lord will scatter the bones of them that please themselves.\"[fn-8-P844_171673:558-nf] Others change their garb and assume the mien of men, being ashamed of being what they were born to be-women. They cut off their hair and are not ashamed to look like eunuchs. Some clothe themselves in goat's hair, and, putting on hoods, think to become children again by making themselves look like so many owls.[fn-8-P845_172038:559-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":53,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_03_introduction","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"97","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"When we examine the interpretation of Scripture by which Hilary reaches the desired conclusions we find it, in many instances, strange indeed. The letter of the Gospels tells us of bodily needs and of suffering; Christ, though more than man, is proved to be Man by His obvious submission to the conditions of human life. But according to Hilary all human suffering is due to the union of an imperfect soul with an imperfect body. The soul of Christ, though truly human, was perfect; His body was that of a Person Divine as well as human. Thus both elements were perfect of their kind, and therefore as free from infirmity[fn-4-P435_329903:261-nf] as from sin, for affliction is the lot of man not because he is man, but because he is a sinner. In contrast with the squalor of sinful humanity, glory surrounded Christ from the Annunciation onward throughout His course on earth[fn-4-P436_330157:262-nf] . Miracle is the attestation of His Godhead, and He who was thus superior to the powers of nature could not be subject to the sufferings which nature inflicts. But, being omnipotent, He could subject Himself to humiliations which no power less than His own could lay upon Him, and this self-subjection is the supreme evidence of His might as well of His goodwill towards men. God, and only God, could occupy at once the cradle and the throne on high[fn-4-P437_330685:263-nf] . Thus in emphasizing the humiliation Hilary is extolling the majesty of Christ, and refuting the errors of Arianism. That school had made the most of Christ's sufferings, holding them as proof of His inferiority to the Father. In Hilary's eyes His power to condescend and His final victory are equally conclusive evidences of His co-equal Divinity. But if He stoops to our estate, and is at the same time God exercising His full prerogatives, here again there must be a 'dispensation.' He was truly subject to the limitations of our nature; that is a fact of revelation. But He was subject by a succession of detached acts of self-restraint, culminating in the act, voluntary like the others, of His death[fn-4-P438_331425:264-nf] . of His acceptance of the ordinary infirmities of humanity we have already spoken. Hilary gives the same explanation of the Passion as he does of the thirst or weariness of Christ. That He could suffer, and that to the utmost, is proved by the fact that He did suffer; yet was He, or could He be, conscious of suffering? For the fulfilment of the Divine purpose, for our assurance of the reality of His work, the acts had to be done; but it was sufficient that they should be done by a dispensation, in other words, that the events should be real and yet the feelings be absent of which, had the events happened to US, we should have been conscious. To understand this we must recur to Hilary's theory of the relation of the soul to the body. The former is the organ of sense, the latter alifeless thing. But the soul may fall below, or rise above, its normal state. Mortification of the body may set in, or drugs be administered which shall render the soul incapable of feeling the keenest pain[fn-4-P439_332445:265-nf] . On the other hand it is capable of a spiritual elevation which shall make it unconscious of bodily needs or sufferings, as when Moses and Elijah fasted, or the three Jewish youths walked amid the flames[fn-4-P440_332670:266-nf] . On this high level Christ always dwelt. Others might rise for a moment above themselves; He, not although, but because He was true and perfect Man, never fell below it. He placed Himself in circumstances where shame and wounds and death were inflicted upon Him; He had lived a life of humiliation, not only real, in that it involved a certain separation from God, but also apparent. But as in this latter respect we may no more overlook His glory than we may suppose Him ignorant, as by Et dispensation He professed to be[fn-4-P441_333321:267-nf] , so in regard to the Passion we must not imagine that He was inferior to His saints in being conscious, as they were not, of suffering[fn-4-P442_333477:268-nf] . So far, indeed, is He from the sense of suffering that Hilary even says that the Passion was a delight to Him[fn-4-P443_334413:269-nf] , and this not merely in its prospective results, but in the consciousness of power which He enjoyed in passing through it. Nor could this be surprising to one who looked with Hilary's eyes upon the humanity of Christ. He enforces his view sometimes with rhetoric, as when he repudiates the notion that the Bread of Life could hunger, and He who gives the living water, thirst[fn-4-P444_334822:270-nf] , that the hand which restored the servant's ear could itself feel pain[fn-4-P445_334914:271-nf] , that He Who said, 'Now is the Son of Man glorified,' when Judas left the chamber, could at that moment be feeling sorrow[fn-4-P446_335052:272-nf] , and He before Whom the soldiers fell be capable of fear[fn-4-P447_335125:273-nf] , or shrink from the pain of a death which was itself an exertion of His own free will and power[fn-4-P448_335237:274-nf] . Or else he dwells upon the general character of Christ's manhood. He recognises no change in the mode of being after the Resurrection; the passing through closed doors, the sudden disappearance at Emmaus are typical of the normal properties of His body, which could heal the sick by a touch, and could walk upon the waves[fn-4-P449_335576:275-nf] . It is a body upon the sensibility of which the forces of nature can make no impression whatever; they can no more pain Him than the stroke of a weapon can affect air or water[fn-4-P450_335965:276-nf] ; or, as Hilary puts it elsewhere, fear and death, which have so painful a meaning to us, were no more to Him than a shower falling Upon a surface which it cannot penetrate[fn-4-P451_336155:277-nf] . It is not the passages of the Gospel which tell of Christ's glory, but those which speak of weakness or suffering that need to be explained; and Hilary on occasion is not afraid to explain them away. For instance, we read that when our Lord had fasted forty days and forty nights 'He was afterward an hungred.' Hilary denies that there is a connection of cause and effect. Christ's perfect body was unaffected by abstinence; but after the fast by an exertion of His will He experienced hunger[fn-4-P452_336676:278-nf] . So also the Agony in the Garden is ingeniously misinterpreted. He took with Him the three Apostles, and then began to be sorrowful. He was not sorrowful till He had taken them, they, not He, were the cause. When He said, 'My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death,' the last words must not be regarded as meaning that His was a mortal sorrow, but as giving a note of time. The sorrow of which He spoke was not for Himself but for His Apostles, whose flight He foresaw, and He was asserting that this sorrow would last till He died. And when He prayed that the cup might pass away from Him, this was no entreaty that He might be spared. It was His purpose to drink it. The prayer was for His disciples that the cup might pass on from Him to them; that they might suffer for Him as martyrs full of hope, without pain or fear[fn-4-P453_337537:279-nf] . One passage, St. Luke xxii. 43, 44, which conflicts with his view is rejected by Hilary on textual grounds, and not without some reason[fn-4-P454_337874:280-nf] . He had looked for it, and found it absent, in a large number of manuscripts, both Greek and Latin. But perhaps the strangest argument which he employs is that when the Gospel tells Us that Christ thirsted and hungered and wept, it does not proceed to say that He ate and drank and felt grief[fn-4-P455_338322:281-nf] . Hunger and thirst, eating and drinking, were two sets of dispensations, unconnected by the relation of cause and effect; the tears were another dispensation, not the expression of personal grief. If, as a habit, He accepts the needs and functions of our body, this does not render His own body more real, for by the act of its creation it was made truly human; His purpose, as has been said, is to enable us to recognise its reality, which would otherwise be difficult[fn-4-P456_338807:282-nf] . If He wept, He had the same object; this use of one of the evidences of bodily emotion would help us to believe[fn-4-P457_338958:283-nf] . And so it is throughout Christ's life on earth. He suffered but He did not feel. No one but a heretic, says Hilary, would suppose that He was pained by the nails which fixed Him to the Cross[fn-4-P458_339321:284-nf] .","title":"Introduction","author":false},{"chapter":53,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_03_introduction","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"97","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"When we examine the interpretation of Scripture by which Hilary reaches the desired conclusions we find it, in many instances, strange indeed.

It is a body upon the sensibility of which the forces of nature can make no impression whatever; they can no more pain Him than the stroke of a weapon can affect air or water[fn-4-P450_335965:276-nf] ; or, as Hilary puts it elsewhere, fear and death, which have so painful a meaning to us, were no more to Him than a shower falling Upon a surface which it cannot penetrate[fn-4-P451_336155:277-nf] . It is not the passages of the Gospel which tell of Christ's glory, but those which speak of weakness or suffering that need to be explained; and Hilary on occasion is not afraid to explain them away. For instance, we read that when our Lord had fasted forty days and forty nights 'He was afterward an hungred.' Hilary denies that there is a connection of cause and effect. Christ's perfect body was unaffected by abstinence; but after the fast by an exertion of His will He experienced hunger[fn-4-P452_336676:278-nf] . So also the Agony in the Garden is ingeniously misinterpreted. He took with Him the three Apostles, and then began to be sorrowful. He was not sorrowful till He had taken them, they, not He, were the cause. When He said, 'My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death,' the last words must not be regarded as meaning that His was a mortal sorrow, but as giving a note of time. The sorrow of which He spoke was not for Himself but for His Apostles, whose flight He foresaw, and He was asserting that this sorrow would last till He died. And when He prayed that the cup might pass away from Him, this was no entreaty that He might be spared. It was His purpose to drink it. The prayer was for His disciples that the cup might pass on from Him to them; that they might suffer for Him as martyrs full of hope, without pain or fear[fn-4-P453_337537:279-nf] . One passage, St. Luke xxii. 43, 44, which conflicts with his view is rejected by Hilary on textual grounds, and not without some reason[fn-4-P454_337874:280-nf] . He had looked for it, and found it absent, in a large number of manuscripts, both Greek and Latin. But perhaps the strangest argument which he employs is that when the Gospel tells Us that Christ thirsted and hungered and wept, it does not proceed to say that He ate and drank and felt grief[fn-4-P455_338322:281-nf] . Hunger and thirst, eating and drinking, were two sets of dispensations, unconnected by the relation of cause and effect; the tears were another dispensation, not the expression of personal grief. If, as a habit, He accepts the needs and functions of our body, this does not render His own body more real, for by the act of its creation it was made truly human; His purpose, as has been said, is to enable us to recognise its reality, which would otherwise be difficult[fn-4-P456_338807:282-nf] . If He wept, He had the same object; this use of one of the evidences of bodily emotion would help us to believe[fn-4-P457_338958:283-nf] . And so it is throughout Christ's life on earth. He suffered but He did not feel. No one but a heretic, says Hilary, would suppose that He was pained by the nails which fixed Him to the Cross[fn-4-P458_339321:284-nf] .","title":"Introduction","author":false},{"chapter":53,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_03_introduction","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"97","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"When we examine the interpretation of Scripture by which Hilary reaches the desired conclusions we find it, in many instances, strange indeed. The letter of the Gospels tells us of bodily needs and of suffering; Christ, though more than man, is proved to be Man by His obvious submission to the conditions of human life. But according to Hilary all human suffering is due to the union of an imperfect soul with an imperfect body. The soul of Christ, though truly human, was perfect; His body was that of a Person Divine as well as human. Thus both elements were perfect of their kind, and therefore as free from infirmity[fn-4-P435_329903:261-nf] as from sin, for affliction is the lot of man not because he is man, but because he is a sinner. In contrast with the squalor of sinful humanity, glory surrounded Christ from the Annunciation onward throughout His course on earth[fn-4-P436_330157:262-nf] . Miracle is the attestation of His Godhead, and He who was thus superior to the powers of nature could not be subject to the sufferings which nature inflicts. But, being omnipotent, He could subject Himself to humiliations which no power less than His own could lay upon Him, and this self-subjection is the supreme evidence of His might as well of His goodwill towards men. God, and only God, could occupy at once the cradle and the throne on high[fn-4-P437_330685:263-nf] . Thus in emphasizing the humiliation Hilary is extolling the majesty of Christ, and refuting the errors of Arianism. That school had made the most of Christ's sufferings, holding them as proof of His inferiority to the Father. In Hilary's eyes His power to condescend and His final victory are equally conclusive evidences of His co-equal Divinity. But if He stoops to our estate, and is at the same time God exercising His full prerogatives, here again there must be a 'dispensation.' He was truly subject to the limitations of our nature; that is a fact of revelation. But He was subject by a succession of detached acts of self-restraint, culminating in the act, voluntary like the others, of His death[fn-4-P438_331425:264-nf] . of His acceptance of the ordinary infirmities of humanity we have already spoken. Hilary gives the same explanation of the Passion as he does of the thirst or weariness of Christ. That He could suffer, and that to the utmost, is proved by the fact that He did suffer; yet was He, or could He be, conscious of suffering? For the fulfilment of the Divine purpose, for our assurance of the reality of His work, the acts had to be done; but it was sufficient that they should be done by a dispensation, in other words, that the events should be real and yet the feelings be absent of which, had the events happened to US, we should have been conscious. To understand this we must recur to Hilary's theory of the relation of the soul to the body. The former is the organ of sense, the latter alifeless thing. But the soul may fall below, or rise above, its normal state. Mortification of the body may set in, or drugs be administered which shall render the soul incapable of feeling the keenest pain[fn-4-P439_332445:265-nf] . On the other hand it is capable of a spiritual elevation which shall make it unconscious of bodily needs or sufferings, as when Moses and Elijah fasted, or the three Jewish youths walked amid the flames[fn-4-P440_332670:266-nf] . On this high level Christ always dwelt. Others might rise for a moment above themselves; He, not although, but because He was true and perfect Man, never fell below it. He placed Himself in circumstances where shame and wounds and death were inflicted upon Him; He had lived a life of humiliation, not only real, in that it involved a certain separation from God, but also apparent. But as in this latter respect we may no more overlook His glory than we may suppose Him ignorant, as by Et dispensation He professed to be[fn-4-P441_333321:267-nf] , so in regard to the Passion we must not imagine that He was inferior to His saints in being conscious, as they were not, of suffering[fn-4-P442_333477:268-nf] . So far, indeed, is He from the sense of suffering that Hilary even says that the Passion was a delight to Him[fn-4-P443_334413:269-nf] , and this not merely in its prospective results, but in the consciousness of power which He enjoyed in passing through it. Nor could this be surprising to one who looked with Hilary's eyes upon the humanity of Christ. He enforces his view sometimes with rhetoric, as when he repudiates the notion that the Bread of Life could hunger, and He who gives the living water, thirst[fn-4-P444_334822:270-nf] , that the hand which restored the servant's ear could itself feel pain[fn-4-P445_334914:271-nf] , that He Who said, 'Now is the Son of Man glorified,' when Judas left the chamber, could at that moment be feeling sorrow[fn-4-P446_335052:272-nf] , and He before Whom the soldiers fell be capable of fear[fn-4-P447_335125:273-nf] , or shrink from the pain of a death which was itself an exertion of His own free will and power[fn-4-P448_335237:274-nf] . Or else he dwells upon the general character of Christ's manhood. He recognises no change in the mode of being after the Resurrection; the passing through closed doors, the sudden disappearance at Emmaus are typical of the normal properties of His body, which could heal the sick by a touch, and could walk upon the waves[fn-4-P449_335576:275-nf] .

He had no occasion to discuss the doctrine, and his teaching is that which was traditional in his day, without any such anticipations of future thought as we found in his treatment of sin. Since the humanity of Christ is universal, His death was on behalf of all mankind, 'to buy the salvation of the whole human race by the offering of this holy and perfect Victim[fn-5-P562_388328:376-nf] .' His last cry upon the cross was the expression of His sorrow that some would not profit by His sacrifice; that He was not, as He had desired, bearing the sins of all[fn-5-P563_388530:377-nf] . He wasable to take them upon Him because He had both natures. His manhood could do what His Godhead could not; it could atone for the sins of men.

Thus the human sufferings of Christ, unjustly inflicted, involve His enemy in condemnation and forfeit his right to hold mankind enslaved. Therefore we are set free[fn-5-P567_389471:381-nf] , and the sinless Passion and death are the triumph of the flesh over spiritual wickedness and the vengeance of God upon it[fn-5-P568_389619:382-nf] . Man is set free, because he is justified in Christ, Who is Man. But the fact that Christ could do the works necessary to this end is proof that He is God. These works included the endurance of such suffering-in the sense, of course, which Hilary attaches to the word-as no one who was not more than man could bear. Hence he emphasises the Passion, because in so doing he magnifies the Divine nature of Him Who sustained it[fn-5-P569_390064:383-nf] . He sets forth the sufferings in the light of deeds, of displays of power[fn-5-P570_390169:384-nf] , the greatest wonder being that the Son of God should have made Himself passible. Yet though it was from union with the Godhead that His humanity possessed the purity, the willingness, the power to win this victory, and thought, in Hilary's words, it was immortal God Who died Upon the Cross, still it was a victory won not by God but by the flesh[fn-5-P571_390541:385-nf] . But the Passion must not be regarded simply as an attack, ending in his own overthrow, made by Satan upon Christ. It is also a free satisfaction offered to God by Christ as Man, in order that His sufferings might release us from the punishment we had deserved, being accepted instead of ours[fn-5-P572_390863:386-nf] . This latter was a thought peculiarly characteristic of the West, and especially of St. Cyprian's teaching; but Hilary has had his share in giving prominence to the propitiatory aspect of Christ's self-sacrifice[fn-5-P573_391149:387-nf] . Yet it must be confessed that the death of Christ is somewhat in the background; that Hilary is less interested in its positive value than in its negative aspect, as the cessation from earthly life and the transition to glory. Upon this, and upon the evidential importance of the Passion as a transcendent exertion of power, whereby the Son of God held Himself down and constrained Himself to suffer and die, Hilary chiefly dwells. The death has not, in his eyes, the interest of the Resurrection. The reason is that it does not belong to the course of the Incarnation as fore-ordained by God, but is only a modification of it, rendered necessary by the sinful self-will of man. Had there been no Fall, the visible, palpable flesh would still have been laid aside, though not by death upon the Cross, when Christ's work in the world was done; and there would have been some event corresponding to the Ascension, if not to the Resurrection. 'line body, laid aside on earth, would have been resumed in glory; and human flesh, unfallen and therefore not corrupt, yet free and therefore corruptible, would have entered into perfectly harmonious union with His Divinity, and so have been rendered safe from all possibility of evil. The purpose of raising man to the society of God was anterior to the beginnings of sin; and it is this broader conception that renders the Passion itself intelligible, while relegating it to a secondary place. But Hilary, though as a rule he mentions the subject not for its own sakebut in the course of argument, has as firm a faith in the efficacy of Christ's death and of His continued intercession in His humanity for mankind[fn-5-P574_392855:388-nf] as he has in His triumphant Resurrection.","title":"Introduction","author":false},{"chapter":53,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_03_introduction","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"111","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"We may now turn to the Atonement, by which Christ has overcome sin.

Hilary's language concerning it is, as a rule, simply Scriptural[fn-5-P561_387913:375-nf] . He had no occasion to discuss the doctrine, and his teaching is that which was traditional in his day, without any such anticipations of future thought as we found in his treatment of sin. Since the humanity of Christ is universal, His death was on behalf of all mankind, 'to buy the salvation of the whole human race by the offering of this holy and perfect Victim[fn-5-P562_388328:376-nf] .' His last cry upon the cross was the expression of His sorrow that some would not profit by His sacrifice; that He was not, as He had desired, bearing the sins of all[fn-5-P563_388530:377-nf] . He wasable to take them upon Him because He had both natures. His manhood could do what His Godhead could not; it could atone for the sins of men. Man had been overcome by Satan; Satan, in his turn, has been overcome by Man. In the long conflict, enduring through Christ's life, of which the first pitched battle was the Temptation, the last the Crucifixion, the victory has been won by the Mediator in the flesh[fn-5-P564_388977:378-nf] . The devil was in the wrong throughout. He was deceived, or rather deceived himself, not recognising what it was for which Christ hungered[fn-5-P565_389134:379-nf] . The same delusion as to Christ's character led him afterwards to exact the penalty of sin from One Who had not deserved it[fn-5-P566_389278:380-nf] . Thus the human sufferings of Christ, unjustly inflicted, involve His enemy in condemnation and forfeit his right to hold mankind enslaved. Therefore we are set free[fn-5-P567_389471:381-nf] , and the sinless Passion and death are the triumph of the flesh over spiritual wickedness and the vengeance of God upon it[fn-5-P568_389619:382-nf] . Man is set free, because he is justified in Christ, Who is Man. But the fact that Christ could do the works necessary to this end is proof that He is God. These works included the endurance of such suffering-in the sense, of course, which Hilary attaches to the word-as no one who was not more than man could bear. Hence he emphasises the Passion, because in so doing he magnifies the Divine nature of Him Who sustained it[fn-5-P569_390064:383-nf] . He sets forth the sufferings in the light of deeds, of displays of power[fn-5-P570_390169:384-nf] , the greatest wonder being that the Son of God should have made Himself passible. Yet though it was from union with the Godhead that His humanity possessed the purity, the willingness, the power to win this victory, and thought, in Hilary's words, it was immortal God Who died Upon the Cross, still it was a victory won not by God but by the flesh[fn-5-P571_390541:385-nf] . But the Passion must not be regarded simply as an attack, ending in his own overthrow, made by Satan upon Christ. It is also a free satisfaction offered to God by Christ as Man, in order that His sufferings might release us from the punishment we had deserved, being accepted instead of ours[fn-5-P572_390863:386-nf] .

You write in your letter that, before Paulinianus was made a presbyter, the pope Epiphanius never took you to task in connection with Origen's errors. To begin with, this is doubtful, and I have to consider which of the two men I should believe. He says that he did object, you deny it; he brings forward witnesses, you will not listen to them when they are produced; he even relates that[fn-70-P7040_2289682:30-nf] another besides yourself was arraigned by him: you refuse to admit this in the case of either; be sends a letter to you by one of his clergy, and demands an answer: you are silent, dare not open your lips, and, challenged in Palestine, speak at Alexandria. Which of you is to be believed is not for me to say. I suppose that you yourself would not, in the face of so distinguished a man, venture to claim truth for yourself, and impute falsehood to him. But it is possible that each speaks from his own point of view. I will call a witness against you, and that witness is yourself. For if there were no dispute about doctrines, if you had not roused the anger of an old man, if he had given you no reply, what need was there for you, who do not excel in gifts of speech, to discuss in a single sermon in the church the whole circle of doctrine-the Trinity, the assumption of our Lord's body, the cross, hell, the nature of angels, the condition of souls, the Saviour's resurrection and our own, and this as taking place on this earth (topics perhaps omitted in your manuscript) in the presence of the masses, in the presence, too, of a man of such distinction? and to speakwith such perfect assurance and to gallop through it all without stopping to draw breath? What shall we say of the ancient writers of the Church, who were scarce able to explain single difficulties in many volumes? What of the vessel of election, the Gospel trumpet, the roaring of our lion, the thunderer of the Gentiles, the river of Christian eloquence, who, when confronted by the[fn-70-P7041_2291343:31-nf] mystery concealed from ages and generations, and by[fn-70-P7042_2291412:32-nf] the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God, rather marvels at it than discusses it? What of Isaiah, who pointed beforehand to the Virgin? That single thing was too much for him, and he says,[fn-70-P7043_2291637:33-nf] \"Who shall declare his generation?\" In our age a poor mannikin has been found, who, with one turn of the tongue, and a brilliancy exceeding that of the sun, discourses on all ecclesiastical questions. If no one asked you for the display, and everything was quiet, you were foolish to enter voluntarily upon so hazardous a discussion. If, on the other hand, the object of your speaking was the satisfaction you owed to the faith, it follows that the cause of strife was not the ordination of a[fn-70-P7044_2292148:34-nf] priest, who, it is certain, was ordained long after.

For as customary accuracy of speech distinguishes between names of this kind, and applies the name of \"generation\" in the case of things generated from the essence itself, and understands that of \"creation\" of those things which are external to the nature of their maker, and as on this account the Divine doctrines, in handing down the knowledge of God, have delivered to us the names of \"Father\" and \"Son,\" not those of \"Creator\" and \"work,\" that there might arise no error tending to blasphemy (as might happen if an appellation of the latter kind repelled the Son to the position of an alien and a stranger), and that the impious doctrines which sever the Only-begotten from essential affinity with the Father might find no entrance-seeing all this, I say, he who declares that the appellation of \"product of making\" is one befitting the Son, will safely say by consequence that the name of \"Son\" is properly applicable to that which is the product of making; so that, if the Son is a \"product of making,\" the heaven is called \"Son,\" and the individual things that have been made are, according to our author, properly named by the appellation of \"Son.\" For if He has this name, not because He shares in nature with Him that begat Him, but is called Son for this reason, that He is created, the same argument will permit that a lamb, a dog, a frog, and all things that exist by the will of their maker, should be named by the title of \"Son.\" If, on the other hand, each of these is not a Son and is not called God, by reason of its being external to the nature of the Son, it follows, surely, that He Who is truly Son is Son, and is confessed to be God by reason of His being of the very nature of Him that begat Him. But Eunomius abhors the idea of generation, and excludes it from the Divine doctrine, slandering the term by his fleshly speculations. Well, our discourse, in what precedes, showed sufficiently on this point that, as the Psalmist says, \"they are afraid where no fear is[fn-15-P1519_866538:50-nf] .\" For if it was shown in the case of men that not all generation exists by way of passion, but that that which is material is by passion, while that which is spiritual is pure and incorruptible, (for that which is begotten of the Spirit is spirit and not flesh, and in spirit we see no condition that is subject to passion,) since our author thought it necessary to estimate the Divine power by means of examples among ourselves, let him persuade himself to conceive from the other mode of generation the passionless character of the Divine generation. Moreover, by mixing up together these three names, of which two are equivalent, he thinks that his readers, by reason of the community of sense in the two phrases, will jump to the conclusion that the third is equivalent also. For since the appellation of \"product of making,\" and \"product of creation,\" indicate that the thing made is external to the nature of the maker, he couples with these the phrase, \"product of generation,\" that this too may be interpreted along with those above mentioned. But argument of this sort is termed fraud and falsehood and imposition, not a thoughtful and skilful demonstration. For that only is called demonstration which shows what is unknown from what is acknowledged; but to reason fraudulently and fallaciously, to conceal your own reproach, and to confound by superficial deceits the understanding of men, as the Apostle says, \"of corrupt minds[fn-15-P1520_868001:51-nf] ,\" this no sane man would call a skilful demonstration.","title":"Book IV","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":53,"verse":5,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_112_treatise_ii_on_the_dress_of_virgins_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"ANF-05","text":"5.

Paul instructs and teaches us, saying, \"He that is unmarried careth for the things of the Lord, how he may please God: but he who has contracted marriage careth for the things which are of this world, how he may please his wife.

Why with dressed hair, as if she either had or sought for a husband?

They then who are angry with us on the ground that we are bringing in a strange or interpolated God, viz.:-the Holy Ghost, and who fight so very hard for the letter, should know that they are afraid where no fear is;[fn-46-P4615_1456341:4-nf] and I would have them clearly understand that their love for the letter is but a cloak for their impiety, as shall be shewn later on, when we refute their objections to the utmost of our power. But we have so much confidence in the Deity of the Spirit Whom we adore,[fn-46-P4616_1456624:5-nf] that we will begin our teaching concerning His Godhead by fitting to Him the Names which belong to the Trinity, even though some persons may think us too bold. The Father was the True Light which lighteneth every man coming into the world. The Son was the True Light which lighteneth every man coming into the world. The Other Comforter was the True Light which lighteneth every man coming into the world.[fn-46-P4617_1457375:6-nf] Was and Was and Was, but Was One Thing. Light thrice repeated; but One Light and One God. This was what David represented to himself long before when he said. In Thy Light shall we see Light.[fn-46-P4618_1457581:7-nf] And now we have both seen and proclaim concisely and simply the doctrine[fn-46-P4619_1457671:8-nf] of God the Trinity, comprehending out of Light (the Father), Light (the Son), in Light (the Holy Ghost). He that rejects it, let him reject it;[fn-46-P4620_1457838:9-nf] and he that doeth iniquity, let him do iniquity; we proclaim that which we have understood. We will get us up into a high mountain,[fn-46-P4621_1457987:10-nf] and will shout, if we be not heard, below; we will exalt the Spirit; we will not be afraid; or if we are afraid, it shall be of keeping silence, not of proclaiming.","title":"Oration XXXII.","author":"Gregory Nazianzen"},{"chapter":53,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_40_to_the_bishops_of_egypt","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"37","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"But it is written[fn-40-P4040_1692870:95-nf] , say they, `The Lord created me in the beginning of His ways for His works.' O untaught and insensate that ye are! He is called also in the Scriptures, `servant[fn-40-P4041_1693070:96-nf] ,' and `son of a handmaid,' and `lamb,' and `sheep,' and it is said that He suffered toil, and thirst, and was beaten, and has suffered pain. But there is plainly a reasonable ground and cause[fn-40-P4042_1693286:97-nf] , why such representations as these are given of Him in the Scriptures; and it is because He became man and the Son of man, and took upon Him the form of a servant, which is the human flesh: for `the Word,' says John, `was made flesh[fn-40-P4043_1693538:98-nf] .' And since He became man, no one ought to be offended at such expressions; for it is proper to man to be created, and born, and formed, to suffer toil and pain, to die and to rise again from the dead. And as, being Word and Wisdom of the Father, He has all the attributes of the Father, His eternity, and His unchangeableness, and the being like Him in all respects and in all things[fn-40-P4044_1693941:99-nf] , and is neither before nor after, but co-existent with the Father, and is the very form[fn-40-P4045_1694058:100-nf] of the Godhead, and is the Creator, and is not created: (for since He is in essence like[fn-40-P4046_1694178:101-nf] the Father, He cannot be a creature, but must be the Creator, as Himself hath said, `My Father worketh hitherto, and I work[fn-40-P4047_1694328:102-nf] :') so being made man, and bearing our flesh, He is necessarily said to be created and made, and that is proper to all flesh; however, these men, like Jewish vintners, who mix their wine with water[fn-40-P4048_1694545:103-nf] , debase the Word, and subject His Godhead to their notions of created things. Wherefore the Fathers were with reason and justice indignant, and anathematized this most impious heresy; which these persons are now cautious of and keep back, as being easy to be disproved and unsound in every part of it. These that I have set down are but a few of the arguments which go to condemn their doctrines; but if any one desires to enter more at large into the proof against them, he will find that this heresy is not far removed from heathenism, and that it is the lowest and the very dregs of all the other heresies. These last are in error either concerning the body or the incarnation of the Lord, falsifying the truth, some in one way and some in another, or else they deny that the Lord has sojourned here at all, as the Jews erroneously suppose. But this one alone more madly than the rest has dared to assail the very Godhead, and to assert that the Word is not at all, and that the Father was not always a father; so that one might reasonably say that that Psalm was written against them; `The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God[fn-40-P4049_1695745:104-nf] .

So then, my Brethren, have charity. I have explained it to be this garment, this \"wedding garment.\" Faith is praised, it is plain, it is praised: but what kind of faith this is, the Apostle distinguishes. For certain who boasted of faith, and had not a good conversation, the Apostle James rebukes and says, \"Thou believest there is one God, thou doest well; the devils also believe and tremble.\"[fn-48-P4868_2088614:34-nf] Call to mind with me whereupon Peter was praised, whereupon called blessed. Was it because he said, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God\"?[fn-48-P4869_2088782:35-nf] He who pronounced Him blessed, regarded not the sound of the words, but the affection of the heart. For would ye know that Peter's blessedness lay not in these words? The devils also said the same. \"We know Thee who Thou art, the Son of God.\"[fn-48-P4870_2089045:36-nf] Peter confessed Him to be \"the Son of God;\" the devils confessed Him to be \"the Son of God.\" \"Distinguish, my lord, distinguish between the two.\" I do make a plain distinction. Peter spake in love, the devils from fear. And again Peter says, \"I am with Thee, even unto death.\"[fn-48-P4871_2089355:37-nf] The devils say, \"What have we to do with Thee?\" So then thou who art come to the feast, glory not of faith only. Distinguish well the nature of this faith; and then in thee is recognised \"the wedding garment.\" Let the Apostle make the distinction, let him teach us; \"neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith.\"[fn-48-P4872_2089715:38-nf] Tell us, what faith? do not even the devils believe and tremble? I will tell thee, he says, and listen, I will now draw the distinction,\" But faith which worketh by love.\" What faith, then, and of what kind? \"That which worketh by love.\" \"Though I haveall knowledge,\" he says, \"and all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.\" Have faith with love; for love without faith ye cannot have. This I warn, this I exhort, this in the name of the Lord I teach you, Beloved, that ye have faith with love; for ye may possibly have faith without love. I do not exhort you to have faith, but love. For ye cannot have love without faith; the love I mean of God and your neighbour; whence can it come without faith? How doth he love God, who doth not believe on God? How doth the fool love God, \"who saith in his heart, there is no God\"?[fn-48-P4873_2090593:39-nf] Possible it is that ye may believe that Christ hath come and not love Christ.

Behold, in thy mind, I see some two things, thy memory and thy thought, which is, as it were, the seeing faculty and the vision of thy soul. Thou seest something, and perceivest it by the eyes, and thou committest it to the care of the memory. There, within, is that which thou hast committed to thy memory, laid up in secret as in a storehouse, as in a treasury, as in a kind of secret chamber and inner cabinet. Thou thinkest of something else, thy attention is elsewhere; what thou didst see is in thy memory, but not seen by thee, because thy thought is bent on another thing. I prove this at once. I speak to you who know; I mention by name Carthage; all who know it have instantly seen Carthage within the mind. Are there as many Carthages as there are minds of you? You have all seen it by means of this name, by means of these syllables known to you, rushing forth from my mouth: your ears were. touched; the sense of the soul was touched through the body, and the mind bent back from another object to this word, and saw Carthage. Was Carthage made there and then? It was there already, but latent in the memory. Why was latent there? Because thy mind was engaged on another matter; but when thy thought turned back to that which was in the memory, thence it was shaped, and became a kind of vision of the mind. Before, there was not a vision, but there was memory; the vision was made by the turning back of thought to memory. Thy memory, then, showed Carthage to thy thought; and that which was in it before thou didst direct thy mind to the memory, it exhibited to the attention of thy thought when turned upon it. Behold, a showing is effected by the memory, and a vision is produced in thought; and no words passed between, no sign was given from the body: thou didst neither nod, nor write, nor utter a sound; and yet thought saw what the memory showed. But both that which showed, and that to which it showed, are of the same substance. But yet, that thy memory might have Carthage in it, the image was drawn in through the eyes, for thou didst see what thou didst store up in thy memory. So hast thou seen the tree which thou rememberest; so the mountain, the river; so the face of a friend, of an enemy, of father, mother, brother, sister, son, neighbor; so of letters written in a book, of the book itself; so of this church: all these thou didst see, and didst commit to thy memory after they were seen; and didst, as it were, lay up there what thou mightst by thinking see at will, even when they should be absent from these eyes of the body. Thou sawest Carthage when thou wast at Carthage; thy soul received the image by the eyes; this image was laid up in thy memory; and thou, the person who wast present at Carthage, didst keep something within thee which thou mightst be able to see with thyself, even when thou shouldst not be there. All these things thou didst receive from without. What the Father shows to the Son, He does not receive from without: all comes to pass within, because there would be no creature at all without, unless the Father had made it by the Son. Every creature was made by God; before it was made it was not in being. It was not therefore seen, after being made and retained in memory, that the Father might show it to the Son, as the memory might show to thought; but, on the contrary, the Father showed it to be made, the Son saw it to be made; and the Father made it by showing, because He made it by the Son seeing. And therefore we ought not to be surprised that it is said, \"But what He seeth the Father doing,\" not showing. For by this it is intimated that, with the Father, to do and to show is the same thing; that hence we may understand that He doeth all things by the Son seeing. Neither is that showing, nor that seeing, temporal. Forasmuch as all times are made by the Son, they could not certainly be shown to Him at any point of time to be made. But the Father's showing begets the Son's seeing, just in the same manner as the Father begets the Son. For the showing produces the seeing, not the seeing the showing. And if we were able to look into this matter more purely and perfectly, perhaps we should find that the Father is not one thing, His showing another; nor the Son one thing, His seeing another. But if we have hardly apprehended this,-if we have hardly been able to explain how the memory exhibits to the thought what it has received from without,-how much less can we take in or explain how God the Father shows to the Son, what He has not from elsewhere, or that which is not other than Himself! We are only little ones: I tell you what God is not, do not show you what God is. What shall we do, then, that we may apprehend what He is? Can ye do this by or through me? I say this to the little ones, both to you and to myself; there is by whom we can: we have just now sung, just now heard, \"Cast thy care upon the Lord, and He will nourish thee.\"[fn-11-P1186_740566:16-nf] The reason why thou art not able, O man, is because thou art a little one; being a little one, thou must be nourished; being nourished, thou wilt become full-grown; and what as a little one thou couldst not, thou shalt see when full-grown; but that thou mayest be nourished, \"cast thy care upon the Lord, and He will nourish thee.\"","title":"Tractate XXIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":53,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_77_homily_lxxi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"But wherefore \"like unto this?\" Because this makes the way for that, and by it is again established; \"For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light;'[fn-68-P6888_2108694:5-nf] and again, \"The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.\" And what in conssequence of this? \"They are corrupt, and become abminable in their ways.\"[fn-68-P6889_2108867:6-nf] And again, \"The love of money is the root of all evils; which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith; \"[fn-68-P6890_2109006:7-nf] and, \"He that loveth me, will keep my commandment.\"[fn-68-P6891_2109077:8-nf] ","title":"Homily LXXI.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":53,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_60_discourse_iii","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"73","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"50.
