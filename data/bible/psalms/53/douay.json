[1 Kings 23.19]","Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me in thy strength.","O God, hear my prayer:  give ear to the words of my mouth.","For strangers have risen up against me; and the mighty have\nsought after my soul:  and they have not set God before their eyes.","For behold God is my helper:  and the Lord is the protector of my\nsoul.","Turn back the evils upon my enemies; and cut them off in thy\ntruth.","I will freely sacrifice to thee, and will give praise, O God, to\nthy name:  because it is good:","For thou hast delivered me out of all trouble:  and my eye hath\nlooked down upon my enemies."]}
