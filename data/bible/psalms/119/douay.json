{"verses":["In my trouble I cried to the Lord:  and he heard me.","O Lord, deliver my soul from wicked lips, and a deceitful\ntongue.","What shall be given to thee, or what shall be added to thee, to\na deceitful tongue?","The sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals that lay waste.","Woe is me, that my sojourning is prolonged!  I have dwelt with\nthe inhabitants of Cedar:","My soul hath been long a sojourner.","With them that hated peace I was peaceable:  when I spoke to them\nthey fought against me without cause."]}
