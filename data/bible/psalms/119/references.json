How comes it, I ask, that godless men live to old age in the enjoyment of this world's riches? How comes it that untutored youth and innocent childhood are cut down while still in the bud? Why is it that children three years old or two, and even unweaned infants, are possessed with devils, covered with leprosy, and eaten up with jaundice, while godless men and profane, adulterers and murderers, have health and strength to blaspheme God? Are we not told that the unrighteousness of the father does not fall upon the son,[fn-12-P1200_256337:799-nf] and that \"the soul that sinneth it shall die?\"[fn-12-P1201_256408:800-nf] Or if the old doctrine holds good that the sins of the fathers must be visited upon the children,[fn-12-P1202_256529:801-nf] an old man's countless sins cannot fairly be avenged upon a harmless infant. And I have said: \"Verily, I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency. For all the day long have I been plagued.\"[fn-12-P1203_256761:802-nf] Yet when I have thought of these things, like the prophet I have learned to say: \"When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me; until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.\"[fn-12-P1204_257008:803-nf] Truly the judgments of the Lord are a great deep.[fn-12-P1205_257097:804-nf] \"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!\"[fn-12-P1206_257254:805-nf] God is good, and all that He does must be good also. Does He decree that I must lose my husband?

If I become deaf I shall escape from sinful words, and my thoughts shall be of God alone.

I speak plainly. To use the language of Scripture, I do not spare to pluck out my own eye if it cause me to offend, nor to cut off my hand and my foot if they cause me to do so.[fn-18-P1802_437773:1250-nf] And you must be treated in the same way whether you are my eyes, or my hands, or my feet. For what Catholic, what Christian who adorns his faith with good works, can hear with calmness Origen's teaching and counsel, or believe in his extraordinary preaching? \"The Son,\" he tells us, \"cannot see the Father, and the Holy Spirit cannot see the Son.\" These words occur in his book \"On First Principles;\" thus we read, and thus Origen has spoken. \"For as it is unsuitable to say that the Son can see the Father, it is consequently unsuitable to suppose that the Spirit can see the Son.\"[fn-18-P1803_438397:1251-nf] Can any one, moreover, brook Origen's assertion that men's souls were once angels in heaven, and that having sinned in the upper world, they have been cast down into this, and have been confined in bodies as in barrows or tombs, to pay the penalty for their former sins; and that the bodies of believers are not temples of Christ,[fn-18-P1804_438768:1252-nf] but prisons of the condemned? Again, he tampers with the true meaning of the narrative by a false use of allegory, multiplying words without limit; and undermines the faith of the simple by the most varied arguments. Now he maintains that souls, in Greek the \"cool things,\" from a word meaning to be cool,[fn-18-P1805_439113:1253-nf] are so called because in coming down from the heavenly places to the lower world they have lost their former heat;[fn-18-P1806_439318:1254-nf] and now, that our bodies are called by the Greeks chains, from a word meaning chain,[fn-18-P1807_439436:1255-nf] or else (on the analogy of our own Latin word) \"things fallen,\"[fn-18-P1808_439541:1256-nf] because our souls have fallen from heaven; and that the other word for body which the abundance of the Greek idiom supplies[fn-18-P1809_439715:1257-nf] is by many taken to mean a funeral monument,[fn-18-P1810_439775:1258-nf] because the soul is shut up within it in the same way as the corpses of the dead are shut up in tombs and barrows. If this doctrine is true what becomes of our faith? Where is the preaching of the resurrection? Where is the teaching of the apostles, which lasts on to this day in the churches of Christ? Where is the blessing to Adam, and to his seed, and to Noah and his sons? \"Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.\"[fn-18-P1811_440222:1259-nf] According to Origen, these words must be a curse and not a blessing; for he turns angels into human souls, compelling them to leave the place of highest rank and to come down lower, as though God were unable through the action of His blessing to grant souls to the human race, had the angels not sinned, and as though for every birth on earth there must be a fall in heaven. We are to give up, then, the teaching of apostles and prophets, of the law, and of our Lord and Saviour Himself, in spite of His language loud as thunder in the gospel. Origen, on the other hand, commands and urges-not to say binds-his disciples not to pray to ascend into heaven, lest sinning once more worse than they had sinned on earth they should be hurled down into the world again. Such foolish and insane notions he generally confirms by distorting the sense of the Scriptures and making them mean what they do not mean at all. He quotes this passage from the Psalms: \"Before thou didst humble me by reason of my wickedness, I went wrong;\"[fn-18-P1812_441278:1260-nf] and this, \"Return unto thy rest, O my soul;\"[fn-18-P1813_441398:1261-nf] this also, \"Bring my soul out of prison;\"[fn-18-P1814_441462:1262-nf] and this, \"I will make confession unto the Lord in the land of the living,\"[fn-18-P1815_441562:1263-nf] although there can be no doubt that the meaning of the divine Scripture is different from the interpretation by which he unfairly wrests it to the support of his own heresy. This way of acting is common to the Manichaeans, the Gnostics, the Ebionites, the Marcionites, and the votaries of the other eighty heresies,[fn-18-P1816_441946:1264-nf] all of whom draw their proofs from the pure well of the Scriptures, not, however, interpreting it in the sense in which it is written, but trying to make the simple language of the Church's writers accord with their own wishes.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":119,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"610","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"10.

The apostles James, Peter, John, and Jude, have published seven epistles at once spiritual and to the point, short and long, short that is in words but lengthy in substance so that there are few indeed who do not find themselves in the dark when they read them.

In my younger days I was carried away with a great passion for learning, yet I was not like some presumptuous enough to teach myself. At Antioch I frequently listened to Apollinaris of Laodicea, and attended his lectures; yet, although he instructed me in the holy scriptures, I never embraced his disputable doctrine as to their meaning. At length my head became sprinkled with gray hairs so that I looked more like a master than a disciple. Yet I went on to Alexandria and heard Didymus.[fn-35-P3529_937729:2556-nf] And I have much to thank him for: for what I did not know I learned from him, and what I knew already I did not forget. So excellent was his teaching. Men fancied that I had now made an end of learning. Yet once more I came to Jerusalem and to Bethlehem. What trouble and expense it cost me to get Baraninas[fn-35-P3530_938061:2557-nf] to teach me under cover of night. For by his fear of the Jews he presented to me in his own person a second edition of Nicodemus.[fn-35-P3531_938354:2558-nf] Of all of these I have frequently made mention in my works. The doctrines of Apollinaris and of Didymus are mutually contradictory. The squadrons of the two leaders must drag me in different directions, for I acknowledge both as my masters. If it is expedient to hate any men and to loath any race, I have a strange dislike to those of the circumcision. For up to the present day they persecute our Lord Jesus Christ in the synagogues of Satan.[fn-35-P3532_938821:2559-nf] Yet can anyone find fault with me for having had a Jew as a teacher? Does a certain person dare to bring forward against me the letter I wrote to Didymus calling him my master? It is a great crime, it would seem, for me a disciple to give to one both old and learned the name of master. And yet when I ask leave to look at the letter which has been held over so long to discredit me at last, there is nothing in it but courteous language and a few words of greeting. Such charges are both foolish and frivolous. It would be more to the point to exhibit a passage in which I have defended heresy or praised some wicked doctrine of Origen. In the portion of Isaiah which describes the crying of the two seraphim[fn-35-P3533_939556:2560-nf] he explains these to be the Son and the Holy Ghost; but have not I altered this hateful explanation into a reference to the two testaments?[fn-35-P3534_939717:2561-nf] I have the book in my hand as it was published twenty years ago. In numbers of my works and especially in my commentaries I have, as occasion has offered, mangled this heathen school. And if my opponents allege that I have done more than anyone else to form a collection of Origen's books, I answer that I only wish I could have the works of all theological writers that by diligent study of them, I might make up for the slowness of my own wits. I have made a collection of his books, I admit; but because I know everything that he has written I do not follow his errors. I speak as a Christian to Christians: believe one who has tried him. His doctrines are poisonous, they are unknown to the Holy Scriptures, nay more, they do them violence. I have read Origen, I repeat, I have read him; and if it is a crime to read him, I admit my guilt: indeed, these Alexandrian writings have emptied my purse. If you will believe me, I have never been an Origenist: if you will not believe me, I have now ceased to be one. But if even this fails to convince you, you will compel me in self-defence to write against your favourite, so that, if you will not believe me when I disclaim him, you will have to believe me when I attack him. But I find readier credence when I go wrong than when I shew amendment. And this is not surprising, for my would-be friends suppose me a fellow-disciple with them in the arcana of their system. I am loath, they fancy, to profess esoteric doctrines before persons who according to them are brute-like and made of clay. For it is an axiom with them that pearls ought not to be lightly cast before swine, nor that which is holy given to the dogs.[fn-35-P3535_941417:2562-nf] They agree with David when he says: \"Thy word have I hid in mine heart that I might not sin against thee;\"[fn-35-P3536_941547:2563-nf] and when in another place he describes the righteous man as one \"who speaketh truth with his neighbour,\"[fn-35-P3537_941675:2564-nf] that is with those who \"are of the household of faith.\"[fn-35-P3538_941774:2565-nf] From these passages they conclude that those of us who as yet are uninitiated ought to be told falsehoods, lest, being still unweaned babes, we should be choked by too solid food. Now that perjury and lying enter into their mysteries and form a bond between them appears most clearly from the sixth book of Origen's Miscellanies,[fn-35-P3539_942126:2566-nf] in which he harmonizes the Christian doctrine[fn-35-P3540_942241:2567-nf] with the conceptions of Plato.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":119,"verse":62,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1153","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"You tell me farther that Vigilantius execrates vigils.

I think, therefore, that I ought to warn you, in all kindness and affection, to hold fast the faith of the saintly Innocent, the spiritual son of Anastasius and his successor in the apostolic see; and not to receive any foreign doctrine, however wise and discerning you may take yourself to be. Men of this type whisper in corners and pretend to inquire into the justice of God. Why, they ask, was a particular soul born in a particular province? What is the reason that some are born of Christian parents, others among wild beasts and savage tribes who have no knowledge of God?

Not many years bad passed since Christians were accustom d to encourage themselves to martyrdom, in default of well-known heroes of their own faith , by the example of Daniel and his companions, or of the Seven Maccabees and their Mother.

His confidence in their work, which is not exceeded by that of St. Augustine, encourages him to draw lessons from the differences between the Hebrew and theSeptuagint titles of the Pslams. For instance, Psalm cxlii. has been furnished in the Septuagint with a title which attributes it to David when pursued by Absalom. The contents of the Psalm are appropriate neither to the circumstances nor to the date. But this does not justify us in ignoring the title. We must regard the fact that a wrong connection is given to the Pslam as a warning to ourselves not to attempt to discover its historical position, but confine ourselves to its spiritual sense. And this is not all. Another Psalm, the third, is assigned in the Hebrew to the same king in the same distress.

The same title of beatissimus is given to Daniel and to St. Paul when both are cited in Comm. in Matt. xxv. 3; indeed, he and others of his day seem to have felt that the Saints of the Old Covenant were as near to themselves as those of the New. Not many years bad passed since Christians were accustom d to encourage themselves to martyrdom, in default of well-known heroes of their own faith , by the example of Daniel and his companions, or of the Seven Maccabees and their Mother. But Scripture is not only harmonious throughout, as Origen had taught; it is also never otiose. It never repeats itself, and a significance must be sought not only in the smallest differences of language, but also in the order in which apparent synonyms occur[fn-3-P319_267593:151-nf] ; in fact, every detail, and every sense in which every detail may be interpreted, is a matter for profitable enquiry[fn-3-P320_267870:152-nf] . Hence, the text of Scripture not only bears, but demands, the most strict and literal interpretation. Hilary's explanation of the words, 'My soul is sorrowful even unto death,' in Tract. in Ps. cxli. efmqefmrefmsefmtefmuefmvefmwefmxefmy~ . His confidence in their work, which is not exceeded by that of St. Augustine, encourages him to draw lessons from the differences between the Hebrew and theSeptuagint titles of the Pslams. For instance, Psalm cxlii. has been furnished in the Septuagint with a title which attributes it to David when pursued by Absalom. The contents of the Psalm are appropriate neither to the circumstances nor to the date. But this does not justify us in ignoring the title. We must regard the fact that a wrong connection is given to the Pslam as a warning to ourselves not to attempt to discover its historical position, but confine ourselves to its spiritual sense. And this is not all. Another Psalm, the third, is assigned in the Hebrew to the same king in the same distress. But, though this attribution is certainly correct, here also we must follow the leading of the Septuagint, which was fell to give a wrong title to one Psalm lest we should attach importance to the correct title of another.

The Lord Himself, speaking by the Psalmist, says: \"As for my saints which are upon earth, He hath caused all my purposes to be admired in them.\"[fn-6-P620_419585:184-nf] Not their merits, but \"my purposes.\" For what is theirs except that which is afterwards mentioned,-\"their weaknesses are multiplied,\"[fn-6-P621_419738:185-nf] -above the weakness that they had? Moreover, the law also entered, that the offence might abound. But why does the Psalmist immediately add: \"They hastened after?\"[fn-6-P622_419921:186-nf] When their sorrows and infirmities multiplied (that is, when their offence abounded), they then sought the Physician more eagerly, in order that, where sin abounded, grace might much more abound. He then says: \"I will not gather their assemblies together [with their offerings] of blood;\" for by their many sacrifices of blood, when they gathered their assemblies into the tabernacle at first, and then into the temple, they were rather convicted as sinners than cleansed. I shall no longer, He says, gather their assemblies of blood-offerings together; because there is one blood-shedding given for many, whereby they may be truly cleansed. Then it follows: \"Neither will I make mention of their names with my lips,\" as if they were the names of renewed ones. For these were their names at first: children of the flesh, children of the world, children ofwrath, children of the devil, unclean, sinners, impious; but afterwards, children of God,-a new name to the new man, a new song to the singer of what is new, by means of the New Testament. Men must not be ungracious with God's grace, mean with great things; [but be ever rising] from the less to the greater. The cry of the whole Church is, \"I have gone astray like a lost sheep.\"[fn-6-P623_421176:187-nf] From all the members of Christ the voice is heard: \"All we, as sheep, have gone astray; and He hath Himself been delivered up for our sins.\"[fn-6-P624_421339:188-nf] The whole of this passage of prophecy is that famous one in Isaiah which was expounded by Philip to the eunuch of Queen Candace, and he believed in Jesus.[fn-6-P625_421515:189-nf] See how often he commends this very subject, and, as it were, inculcates it again and again on proud and contentious men: \"He was a man under misfortune, and one who well knows to bear infirmities; wherefore also He turned away His face, He was dishonoured, and was not much esteemed. He it is that bears our weaknesses, and for us is involved in pains: and we accounted Him to be in pains, and in misfortune, and in punishment. But it was He who was wounded for our sins, was weakened for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and by His bruise we are healed. All we, as sheep, have gone astray; and the Lord delivered Him up for our sins. And although He was evilly entreated, yet He opened not His mouth: as a sheep was He led to the slaughter, and as a lamb is dumb before the shearer, so He opened not His mouth. In His humiliation His judgment was taken away: His generation who shall declare? For His life shall be taken away from the earth, and for the iniquities of my people was He led to death. Therefore I will give the wicked for His burial, and the rich for His death; because He did no iniquity, nor deceit with His mouth. The Lord is pleased to purge Him from misfortune. If you could yourselves have given your soul on account of your sins, ye should see a seed of a long life. And the Lord is pleased to rescue His soul from pains, to show Him light, and to form it through His understanding; to justify the Just One, who serves many well; and He shall Himself bear their sins. Therefore He shall inherit many, and He shall divide the spoils of the mighty; and He was numbered amongst the transgressors; and Himself bare the sins of many, and He was delivered for their iniquities.\"[fn-6-P626_423264:190-nf] Consider also that passage of this same prophet which Christ actually declared to be fulfilled in Himself, when He recited it in the synagogue, in discharging the function of the reader:[fn-6-P627_423475:191-nf] \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed me: to preach glad tidings to the poor hath He sent me, that so I may refresh all who are broken-hearted,-to preach deliverance to the captives, and to the blind sight.\"[fn-6-P628_423733:192-nf] Let us then all acknowledge Him; nor should there be one exception among persons like ourselves, who wish to cleave to His body, to enter through Him into the sheepfold, and to attain to that life and eternal salvation which He has promised to His own.-Let us, I repeat, all of us acknowledge Him who did no sin, who bare our sins in His own body on the tree, that we might live with righteousness separate from sins; by whose scars we are healed, when we were weak[fn-6-P629_424219:193-nf] -like wandering sheep.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":119,"verse":85,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"38","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"If any one laughs when he sees our subtilty, to use the Psalmist's[fn-11-P1138_261803:7-nf] words, about syllables, let him know that he reaps laughter's fruitless fruit; and let us, neither giving in to men's reproaches, nor yet vanquished by their disparagement, continue our investigation.

But why get an unfair victory for our argument by fighting over these undignified questions, when it is within our power to prove that the excellence of the glory is beyond dispute by adducing more lofty considerations? If, indeed, we retreat what we have been taught by Scripture, every one of the Pneumatomachi will peradventure raise a loud and vehement outcry, stop their ears, pick up stones or anything else that comes to hand for a weapon, and charge against us. But our own security must not be regarded by us before the truth. We have learnt from the Apostle, \"the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patient waiting for Christ\"[fn-17-P1713_437265:451-nf] for our tribulations. Who is the Lord that directs into the love of God and into the patient waiting for Christ for tribulations? Let those men answer us who are for making a slave of the Holy Spirit. For if the argument had been about God the Father, it would certainly have said, `the Lord direct you into His own love,' or if about the Son, it would have added `into His own patience.' Let them then seek what other Person there is who is worthy to be honoured with the title of Lord. And parallel with this is that other passage, \"and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do towards you; to the end He may establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints.\"[fn-17-P1714_438094:452-nf] Now what Lord does he entreat to stablish the hearts of the faithful at Thessalonica, unblamable in holiness before God even our Father, at the coming of our Lord? Let those answer who place the Holy Ghost among the ministering spirits that are sent forth on service. They cannot. Wherefore let them hear yet another testimony which distinctly calls the Spirit Lord. \"The Lord,\" it is said, \"is that Spirit;\" and again \"even as from the Lord the Spirit.\"[fn-17-P1715_442465:453-nf] But to leave no ground for objection, I will quote the actual words of the Apostle;-\"For even unto this day remaineth the same veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament, which yell is done away in Christ. ... Nevertheless, when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. Now the Lord is that Spirit.\"[fn-17-P1716_443419:454-nf] Why does he speak thus? Because he who abides in the bare sense of the letter, and in it busies himself with the observances of the Law, has, as it were, got his own heart enveloped in the Jewish acceptance of the letter, like a veil; and this be-falls him because of his ignorance that the bodily observance of the Law is done away by the presence of Christ, in that for the future the types are transferred to the reality. Lamps are made needless by the advent of the sun; and, on the appearance of the truth, the occupation of the Law is gone, and prophecy is hushed into silence. He, on the contrary, who has been empowered to look down into the depth of the meaning of the Law, and, after passing through the obscurity of the letter, as through a veil, to arrive within things unspeakable, is like Moses taking off the veil when he spoke with God. He, too, turns from the letter to the Spirit. So with the veil on the face of Moses corresponds the obscurity of the teaching of the Law, and spiritual contemplation with the turning to the Lord. He, then, who in the reading of the Law takes away the letter and turns to the Lord,-and the Lord is now called the Spirit,-becomes moreover like Moses, who had his face glorified by the manifestation of God. For just as objects which lie near brilliant colours are themselves tinted by the brightness which is shed around, so is be who fixes his gaze firmly on the Spirit by the Spirit's glory somehow transfigured into greater splendour, having his heart lighted up, as it were, by some light streaming from the truth of the Spirit.[fn-17-P1717_445032:455-nf] And, this is \"being changed from[fn-17-P1718_445310:456-nf] the glory of the Spirit \"into\" His own \"glory,\" not in niggard degree, nor dimly and indistinctly, but as we might expect any one to be who is enlightened by[fn-17-P1719_445500:457-nf] the Spirit. Do you not, O man, fear the Apostle when he says\"Ye are the temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwelleth in you\"?[fn-17-P1720_445654:458-nf] Could he ever have! brooked to honour with the title of \"temple\" the quarters of a slave? How can he who calls Scripture \"God-inspired,\"[fn-17-P1721_446018:459-nf] because it was written through the inspiration of the Spirit, use the language of one who insults and belittles Him?","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":119,"verse":155,"source_code":"npnf1_01_npnf1_01_13_book_v_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"NPNF1-01","text":"23.

Since by divine grace assisting the human will, man may possibly exist in this life without sin, why does he not? To this question I might very easily and truthfully answer: Because men are unwilling. But if I am asked why they are unwilling, we are drawn into a lengthy statement. And yet, without prejudice to a more careful examination, I may briefly say this much: Men are unwilling to do what is right, either because what is right is unknown to them, or because it is unpleasant to them. For we desire a thing more ardently in proportion to the certainty of our knowledge of its goodness, and the warmth of our delight in it. Ignorance, therefore, and infirmity are faults which impede the will from moving either for doing a good work, or for refraining from an evil one. But that what was hidden may come to light, and what was unpleasant may be made agreeable, is of the grace of God which helps the wills of men; and that they are not helped by it, has its cause likewise in themselves, not in God, whether they be predestinated to condemnation, on account of the iniquity of their pride, or whether they are to be judged and disciplined contrary to their very pride, if they are children of mercy. Accordingly Jeremiah, after saying, \"I know, O Lord, that the way of man is not in himself, and that it belongeth not to any man to walk and direct his steps,\"[fn-9-P922_522545:119-nf] immediately adds, \"Correct me, O Lord, but with judgment, and not in Thine anger;\"[fn-9-P923_522647:120-nf] as much as to say, I know that it is for my correction that I am too little assisted by Thee, for my footsteps to be perfectly directed: but yet do not in this so deal with me as Thou dost in Thine anger, when Thou dost determine to condemn the wicked; but as Thou dost in Thy judgment whereby Thou dost teach Thy children not to be proud.

Our reply is briefly this,-the words knew and till in the language of Holy Scripture are capable of a double meaning. As to the former, he himself gave us a dissertation to show that it must be referred to sexual intercourse, and no one doubts that it is often used of the knowledge of the understanding, as, for instance, \"the boy Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem, and his parents knew it not.\" Now we have to prove that just as in the one case he has followed the usage of Scripture, so with regard to the word till he is utterly refuted by the authority of the same Scripture, which often denotes by its use a fixed time (he himself told us so), frequently time without limitation, as when God by the mouth of the prophet says to certain persons,[fn-60-P6021_1785451:15-nf] \"Even to old age I am he.\" Will He cease to be God when they have grown old? And the Saviour in the Gospel tells the Apostles,[fn-60-P6022_1785596:16-nf] \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" Will the Lord then after the end of the world has come forsake His disciples, and at the very time when seated on twelve thrones they are to judge the twelve tribes of Israel will they be bereft of the company of their Lord? Again Paul the Apostle writing to the Corinthians[fn-60-P6023_1785956:17-nf] says, \"Christ the first-fruits, afterward they that are Christ's, at his coming. Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father, when he shall have put down all rule, and all authority and power. For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.\" Granted that the passage relates to our Lord's human nature, we do not deny that the words are spoken of Him who endured the cross and is commanded to sit afterwards on the right hand. What does he mean then by saying, \"for he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet\"? Is the Lord to reign only until His enemies begin to be under His feet, and once they are under His feet will He cease to reign? Of course His reign will then commence in its fulness when His enemies begin to be under His feet. David also in the fourth Song of Ascents[fn-60-P6024_1786836:18-nf] speaks thus, \"Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look unto the Lord our God, until he have mercy upon us.\" Will the prophet, then, look unto the Lord until he obtain mercy, and when mercy is obtained will he turn his eyes down to the ground? although elsewhere he says,[fn-60-P6025_1787338:19-nf] \"Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.\" I could accumulate countless instances of this usage, and cover the verbosity of our assailant with a cloud of proofs; I shall, however, add only a few, and leave the reader to discover like ones for himself.","title":"The Perpetual Virginity of Blessed Mary","author":false},{"chapter":119,"verse":37,"source_code":"npnf1_01_npnf1_01_15_book_vii_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"59","folder":"NPNF1-01","text":"20.

Accordingly, as the law is not made void, but is established through faith, since faith procures grace whereby the law is fulfilled; so free will is not made void through grace, but is established, since grace cures the will whereby righteousness is freely loved.

I pass to the Song of Songs, and whereas our opponent thinks it makes altogether for marriage, I shall show that it contains the mysteries of virginity. Let us hear what the bride says before that the bridegroom comes to earth, suffers, descends to the lower world, and rises again.[fn-63-P6358_1955785:195-nf] \"We will make for thee likenesses of gold with ornaments of silver while the king sits at his table.\" Before the Lord rose again, and the Gospel shone, the bride had not gold, but likenesses of gold. As for the silver, however, which she professes to have at the marriage, she not only had silver ornaments, but she had them in variety-in widows, in the continent, and in the married. Then the bridegroom makes answer to the bride, and teaches her that the shadow of the old law has passed away, and the truth of the Gospel has come.[fn-63-P6359_1956395:196-nf] \"Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away, for lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.\" This relates to the Old Testament. Once more he speaks of the Gospel and of virginity: \"The flowers appear on the earth, the time of the pruning of vines has come.\" Does he not seem to you to say the very same thing that the Apostle says:[fn-63-P6360_1956774:197-nf] \"The time is shortened that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none\"? And more plainly does he herald chastity:[fn-63-P6361_1956938:198-nf] \"The voice,\" he says, \"of the turtle is heard in our land.\" The turtle, the chastest of birds, always dwelling in lofty places, is a type of the Saviour. Let us read the works of naturalists and we shall find that it is the nature of the turtle-dove, if it lose its mate, not to take another; and we shall understand that second marriage is repudiated even by dumb birds. And immediately the turtle says to its fellow:[fn-63-P6362_1957378:199-nf] \"The fig tree hath put forth its green figs,\" that is, the commandments of the old law have fallen, and the blossoming vines of the Gospel give forth their fragrance Whence the Apostle also says,[fn-63-P6363_1957592:200-nf] \"We are a sweet savour of Christ.\"[fn-63-P6364_1957649:201-nf] \"Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. O my dove, thou art in the clefts of the rock, in the covert of the steep place. Let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.\"[fn-63-P6365_1957917:202-nf] Whilst thou coveredst thy countenance like Moses and the veil of the law remained, I neither saw thy face, nor did I condescend to hear thy voice. I said,[fn-63-P6366_1958127:203-nf] \"Yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear.\" But now with unveiled face behold my glory, and shelter thyself in the cleft and steep places of the solid rock. On hearing this the bride disclosed the mysteries of chastity:[fn-63-P6367_1958372:204-nf] \"My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth his flock among the lilies,\" that is among the pure virgin bands. Would you know what sort of a throne our true Solomon, the Prince of Peace, has, and what his attendants are like?[fn-63-P6368_1958620:205-nf] \"Behold,\" he says, \"it is the litter of Solomon: threescore mighty men are about it, of the mighty men of Israel. They all handle the sword, and are expert in war: every man hath his sword upon his thigh.\" They who are about Solomon have their sword upon their thigh, like Ehud, the left-handed judge, who slew the fattest of foes, a man devoted to the flesh, and cut short all his pleasures.[fn-63-P6369_1959048:206-nf] \"I will get me,\" he says, \"to the mountain of myrrh;\" to those, that is, who have mortified their bodies; \"and to the hill of frankincense,\" to the crowds of pure virgins; \"and I will say to my bride, thou art all fair, my love, and there is no spot in thee.\" Whence too the Apostle:[fn-63-P6370_1959352:207-nf] \"That he might present the church to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing.\"[fn-63-P6371_1959483:208-nf] \"Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, with me from Lebanon.

Come then, fairest bride, concerning whom it is elsewhere said[fn-63-P6373_1959866:210-nf] \"Who is she that cometh up, all in white?\" and pass on by way of this world, from the beginning of faith, and from Sanir, which is by interpretation, God of light, as we read in the psalm:[fn-63-P6374_1960077:211-nf] \"Thy word is a lantern unto my feet, and light unto my path;\" and \"from Hermon,\" that is, consecration: and \"flee from the lions' dens, and the mountains of the leopards who cannot change their spots.\" Flee, he says, from the lions' dens, flee from the pride of devils, that when thou hast been consecrated to me, I may be able to say unto thee:[fn-63-P6375_1960445:212-nf] \"Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my bride, thou hast ravished mine heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.\" What he says is something like this-I do not reject marriage: you have a second eye, the left, which I have given to you on account of the weakness of those who cannot see the right. But I am pleased with the right eye of virginity, and if it be blinded the whole body is in darkness. And that we might not think he had in view carnal love and bodily marriage, he at once excludes this meaning by saying[fn-63-P6376_1961003:213-nf] \"Thou hast ravished my heart, my bride, my sister.\" The name sister excludes all suspicion of unhallowed love. \"How fair are thy breasts with wine,\" those breasts concerning which he had said above, My beloved is mine, and I am his: \"betwixt my breasts shall he lie,\" that is in the princely portion of the heart where the Word of God has its lodging. What wine is that which gives beauty to the breasts of the bride, and fills them with the milk of chastity?

Eat, O friends: yea, drink and be drunken, my brethren.\" Hence the Apostles also were said to be filled with new wine; with new, he says, not with old wine; because[fn-63-P6378_1961775:215-nf] new wine is put into fresh wine-skins, and they[fn-63-P6379_1961847:216-nf] did not walk in oldness of the letter, but in newness of the Spirit. This is wine wherewith when youths and maidens are intoxicated, they at once thirst for virginity; they are filled with the spirit of chastity, and the prophecy of Zechariah comes to pass, at least if we follow the Hebrew literally, for he prophesied concerning virgins:[fn-63-P6380_1962207:217-nf] \"And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof. For what is his goodness, and what is his beauty, but the corn of the elect, and wine that giveth birth to virgins?\" They are virgins of whom it is written in the forty-fifth psalm:[fn-63-P6381_1962646:218-nf] \"The virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee. With gladness and rejoicing shall they be led: they shall enter into the King's palace.\" 31. Then follows:[fn-63-P6382_1962857:219-nf] \"A garden shut up is my sister, my bride: a garden shut up, a fountain sealed.\" That which is shut up and sealed reminds us of the mother of our Lord who was a mother and a Virgin. Hence it was that no one before or after our Saviour was laid in his new tomb, hewn in the solid rock. And yet she that was ever a Virgin is the mother of many virgins. For next we read: \"Thy shoots are an orchard of pomegranates with precious fruits.\" By pomegranates and fruits is signified the blending of all virtues in virginity.[fn-63-P6383_1963409:220-nf] \"My beloved is white and ruddy\"; white in virginity, ruddy in martyrdom. And because He is white and ruddy, therefore it is immediately added[fn-63-P6384_1963571:221-nf] \"His mouth is most sweet, yea, he is altogether lovely.\" The virgin bridegroom having been praised by the virgin bride, in turn praises the virgin bride, and says to her:[fn-63-P6385_1963762:222-nf] \"How beautiful are thy feet in sandals,[fn-63-P6386_1963823:223-nf] O daughter of Aminadab,\" which is, being interpreted, a people that offereth itself willingly. For virginity is voluntary, and therefore the steps of the Church in the beauty of chastity are praised. This is not the time for me like a commentator to explain all the mysteries of virginity from the Song of Songs I have no doubt that the fastidious reader will turn up his nose at what has already been said.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":119,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_09_book_ii_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"45","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"8.

And I asked the angel: Who are these? And he said to me: These are they who are sent away to the souls of the sinners in the hour of necessity; for they have not believed that there is judgment and retribution. And I looked up into the heaven, and saw angels, whose faces shone like the sun, girded with golden girdles, having in their hands prizes, on which the name of the Lord was inscribed, full of all meekness and compassion. And I asked the angel: Who are these? And he answered and said to me: These are they who are sent forth in the day of the resurrection to bring the souls of the righteous,[fn-85-P8506_2745377:9-nf] who intrepidly walk according to God.[fn-85-P8507_2745441:10-nf] And I said to the angel: I wish to see the souls of the righteous and of the sinners, how they go out of the world.

And he said to me: Yes; for thus every unjust man disappears. And I looked, and saw a cloud of fire wrapped over all the world; and I said: What is this, my lord? And he said to me: This is the unrighteousness mingled with the destruction of the sinners. And I wept, and said to the angel: I wished to see the departures of the righteous and of the sinners, in what manner they go out of the world. And the angel says to me: Paul, look down, and see what thou hast asked. And I looked, and saw one of the sons of men falling near death.

And the good angels who had received the soul of the righteous man, saluted it, as being well known to them. And it went with them; and the Spirit came forth to meet them, saying: Come, soul, enter into the place of the resurrection, which God hath prepared for His righteous ones. And the angel said to me: Look down to the earth, and behold the soul of the impious, how it goes forth from its tabernacle, which has provoked God to anger, saying, Let us eat and drink;[fn-85-P8510_2747338:13-nf] for who is it that has gone down to Hades, and come up and announced that there is judgment and retribution? And take heed, and see all his works which he has done standing before him. And the evil angels came and the good. The good therefore found no place of rest in it, but the evil took possession of it, saying: O wretched soul, pay heed to thy flesh; take note of that whence thou art coming forth, for thou must return into thy flesh in the day of the resurrection, that thou mayst receive the recompense of thy sins. And when it had gone forth from its tabernacle, the angel who had lived along with it ran up to it, saying to it: O wretched soul, whither goest thou? I am he who each day wrote down thy sins. Thou hast destroyed the time of repentance; be exceedingly ashamed. And when it came, all the angels saw it, and cried out with one voice, saying: Woe to thee, wretched soul! what excuse hast thou come to give to God? And the angel of that soul said: Weep for it, all of you, along with me. And the angel came up, and worshipped the Lord, saying: Lord, behold the soul which has dwelt in wickedness in its time, and in its temporary life; do to it according to Thy decision.

And a voice came to it. saying: Thou wast altogether merciless, and for this reason thou hast been delivered up to such an angel. Confess thy sins which thou hast done in the world. And that soul said: I have not sinned, O righteous Judge. And the Lord said to that soul: Verily thou seemest as if thou wert in the world, and weft hiding thy deeds from men. Knowest thou not that whensoever any one dies, his deeds run before him, whether they are good or evil? And when it heard this, it was silent. And I heard the Judge saying: Let the angel come, having in his hands the record of thy sins. And the Judge says to the angel: I say to thee the angel, Disclose all. Say what he has done five years before his death. By myself I swear to thee, that in the first period of his life there was forgetfulness of all his former sins. And the angel answered and said: Lord, command the souls to stand beside their angels; and that same hour they stood beside them. And the lord of that soul said: Take note of these souls, and whether thou hast in any way sinned against them. And it answered and said: Lord, a year has not been completed since I killed the one and lived with the other. And not only this, but I also wronged it. And the Lord said to it: Knowest thou not that he who wrongs any one in the world is kept, as soon as he dies, in the place until he whom he has wronged come, and both shall be judged before me, and each receive according to his works?

Seventhly, he thinks that the waters which are said in Scripture to be above the heavens are holy and supernal essences, while those which are above the earth and beneath the earth are, on the contrary, demoniacal essences.

Be perfect.'[fn-25-P2530_1016266:71-nf] Again, to the Colossians he writes: 'Warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ.'[fn-25-P2531_1016432:72-nf] And so to the Philippians: `Do all things without murmurings and disputings, that ye may be blameless, and harmless, as the immaculate sons of God.'[fn-25-P2532_1016598:73-nf] In like manner to the Ephesians he writes: `Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ; according as He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before Him.'[fn-25-P2533_1016924:74-nf] Then again to the Colossians he says in another passage: `And you, that were sometime alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath He reconciled in the body of His flesh through death; present yourselves holy and unblameable and unreprovable in His sight.'[fn-25-P2534_1017221:75-nf] In the same strain, he says to the Ephesians: `That He might present to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish.'[fn-25-P2535_1017438:76-nf] So in his first Epistle to the Corinthians he says `Be ye sober, and righteous, and sin not.'[fn-25-P2536_1017553:77-nf] So again in the Epistle of St. Peter it is written `Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end, for the grace that is offered to you: . . . as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance: but as He who hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because it is written,[fn-25-P2537_1017946:78-nf] Be ye holy; for I am holy.'[fn-25-P2538_1017992:79-nf] Whence blessed David likewise says: `O Lord, who shall sojourn in Thy tabernacle, or who shall rest on Thy holy mountain? He that walketh without blame, and worketh righteousness.'[fn-25-P2539_1018195:80-nf] And in another passage: `I shall be blameless with Him.'[fn-25-P2540_1018271:81-nf] And yet again: `Blessed are the blameless in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord.'[fn-25-P2541_1018379:82-nf] To the same effect it is written in Solomon: `The Lord loveth holy hearts, and all they that are blameless are acceptable unto Him.'\"[fn-25-P2542_1018531:83-nf] Now some of these passages exhort men who are running their course that they run perfectly; others refer to the end thereof, that men may reach forward to it as they run. He, however, is not unreasonably said to walk blamelessly, not who has already reached the end of his journey, but who is pressing on towards the end in a blameless manner, free from damnable sins, and at the same time not neglecting to cleanse by almsgiving such sins as are venial. For the way in which we walk, that is, the road by which we reach perfection, is cleansed by clean prayer. That, however, is a clean prayer in which we say in truth, \"Forgive us, as we ourselves forgive.\"[fn-25-P2543_1019210:84-nf] So that, as there is nothing censured when blame is not imputed, we may hold on our course to perfection without censure, in a word, blamelessly; and in this perfect state, when we arrive at it at last, we shall find that there is absolutely nothing which requires cleansing by forgiveness.","title":"Concerning Man's Perfection in Righteousness","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":119,"verse":80,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_18_concerning_man_s_perfection_in_righteousness","source_chapter":23,"source_paragraph":"97","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"He next quotes passages to show that God's commandments are not grievous.

I see you are much more disturbed than is your wont; so I will not ply you with arguments. But let me briefly ask what you think of the well-known passage of the Apostle when he wrote to the Philippians:[fn-73-P7334_2426032:34-nf] \"Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect: but I press on, if so be that I may apprehend that for which also I was apprehended by Christ Jesus. Brethren, I count not myself to have yet apprehended: but one thing I do; forgetting the things which are behind, and stretching forward to the things which are before, I press on towards the goal unto the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Let us, therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in anything ye are otherwise minded, even this shall God reveal unto you,\" and so on; no doubt you know the rest, which, in my desire to be brief, I omit. He says that he had not yet apprehended, and was by no means perfect; but, like an archer, aimed his arrows at the mark set up (more expressively called[fn-73-P7335_2426848:35-nf] skopoj in Greek), lest the shaft, turning to one side or the other, might show the unskilfulness of the archer. He further declares that he always forgot the past, and ever stretched forward to the things in front, thus teaching that no heed should be paid to the past, but the future earnestly desired; so that what to-day he thought perfect, while he was stretching forward to better things and things in front, to-morrow proves to have been imperfect. And thus at every step, never standing still, but always running, he shows that to be imperfect which we men thought perfect, and teaches that our only perfection and true righteousness is that which is measured by the excellence of God. \"I press on towards the goal,\" he says, \"unto the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.\" Oh, blessed Apostle Paul, pardon me, a poor creature who confess my faults, if I venture to ask a question. You say that you had not yet obtained, nor yet apprehended, nor were yet perfect, and that you always forgot the things behind, and stretched forward to the things in front, if by any means you might have part in the resurrection of the dead, and win the prize of your high calling. How, then, is it that you immediately add, \"As many therefore as are perfect are thus minded\"? (or, let us be thus minded, for the copies vary). And what mind is it that we have, or are to have? that we are perfect? that we have apprehended that which we have not apprehended, received what we have not received, are perfect who are not yet perfect? What mind then have we, or rather what mind ought we to have who are not perfect? To confess that we are imperfect, and have not yet apprehended, nor yet obtained, this is true wisdom in man: know thyself to be imperfect; and, if I may so speak, the perfection of all who are righteous, so long as they are in the flesh, is imperfect. Hence we read in Proverbs:[fn-73-P7336_2428781:36-nf] \"To understand true righteousness.\" For if there were not also a false righteousness, the righteousness of God would never be called true. The Apostle continues: \"and if ye are otherwise minded, God will also reveal that to you.\" This sounds strange to my ears. He who but just now said, \"Not that I have already obtained, or am already perfect \"; the chosen vessel, who was so confident of Christ's dwelling in him that he dared to say \"Do ye seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me? \"and yet plainly confessed that he was not perfect; he now gives to the multitude what he denied to himself in particular, he unites himself with the rest and says, \"As many of us as are perfect, let us be thus minded.\" But why he said this, he explains presently. Let us, he means, who wish to be perfect according to the poor measure of human frailty, think this, that we have not yet obtained, nor yet apprehended, nor are yet perfect, and inasmuch as we are not yet perfect, and, perhaps, think otherwise than true and perfect perfection requires, if we are minded otherwise than is dictated by the full knowledge of God, God will also reveal this to us, so that we may pray with David and say,[fn-73-P7337_2429993:37-nf] \"Open Thou mine eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of Thy law.\"","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":119,"verse":133,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_20_on_the_proceedings_of_pelagius_","source_chapter":34,"source_paragraph":"141","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"I shall make my next remark with greater satisfaction. In a former section I expressed a fear[fn-29-P2979_1155489:82-nf] that, when Pelagius said that \"a man was able by the help of God's grace to live without sin,\" he perhaps meant by the term \"grace\" the capability possessed by nature as created by God with a free will, as it is understood in that book which I received as his and to which I replied;[fn-29-P2980_1155795:83-nf] and that by these means he was deceiving the judges, who were ignorant of the circumstances. Now, however, since he anathematizes those persons who hold that \"God's grace and assistance is not given for single actions, but is imparted in the freedom of the will, or in the law and in doctrine,\" it is quite evident that he really means the grace which is preached in the Church of Christ, and is conferred by the ministration of the Holy Ghost for the purpose of helping us in our single actions, whence it is that we pray for needful and suitable grace that we enter not into any temptation. Nor, again, have I any longer a fear that, when he said, \"No man can be without sin unless he has acquired a knowledge of the law,\" and added this explanation of his words, that \"he posited in the knowledge of the law, help towards the avoidance of sin,\"[fn-29-P2981_1156789:84-nf] he at all meant the said knowledge to be considered as tantamount to the grace of God; for, observe, he anathematizes such as hold this opinion. See, too, how he refuses to hold our natural free will, or the law and doctrine, as equivalent to that grace of God which helps us through our single actions What else then is left to him but to understand that grace which the apostle tells us is given by \"the supply of the Spirit?\"[fn-29-P2982_1157239:85-nf] and concerning which the Lord said: \"Take no thought how or what ye shall speak; for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.

For inasmuch ashe rightly anathematized the persons who holdthat God's grace or assistance is not given for single actions, but lies in the gift of free will, or in the law and doctrine, it follows, of course, that God's grace or assistance is given us for single actions,-free will, or the law and the doctrine, being left out of consideration; and thus through all the single actions of our life, when we act rightly, we are ruled and directed by God; nor is our prayer a useless one, wherein we say: \"Order my steps according to Thy word, and let not any iniquity have dominion. over me.\"[fn-29-P2985_1158514:88-nf] ","title":"On the Proceedings of Pelagius,","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":119,"verse":91,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_16_book_v","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"22","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"For as regards the general character of the appellation, the name of \"creature\" is one, as predicated of all things that have come into bring from nothing, while the divisions into sections of the things which we contemplate as included in the term \"creature\", are separated one from the other by the variation of their properties: so that if He is created, and man is created. He was \"emptied,\" to use Eunomius' phrase, to become Himself, and changed His place, not from the transcendent to the lowly, but from what is similar in kind to what (save in regard of the special character of body and the incorporeal) is similar in dignity. To whom now will the just vote of those who have to try our cause be given, or who will seem to them to be under the weight of these charges? he who says that the created was saved by the uncreated God, or he who refers the cause of our salvation to the creature? Surely the judgment of pious men is not doubt-rid. For any one who knows clearly the difference which there is between the created and the uncreated, (terms of which the divergence is marked by dominion and slavery. since the uncreated God, as the prophet says, \"ruleth with His power for ever[fn-16-P1634_943981:43-nf] ,\" while all things in the creation are servants to Him, according to the voice of the same prophet, which says \"all things serve Thee[fn-16-P1635_944141:44-nf] ,\") he, I say, who carefully considers these matters, surely cannot fail to recognize the person who makes the Only-begotten change from servitude to servitude. For if, according to Paul, the whole creation \"is in bondage[fn-16-P1636_944382:45-nf] ,\" and if, according to Eunomius, the essential nature of the Only-begotten is created, our adversaries maintain, surely, by their doctrines, not that the master was mingled with the servant, but that a servant came to be among servants. As for our saying that the Lord was in the form of a servant before His presence in the flesh, that is just like charging us with saying that the stars are black and the sun misty, and the sky low, and water dry, and so on:-a man who does not maintain a charge on the ground of what he has heard, but makes up what seems good to him at his own sweet will, need not be sparing in making against us such charges as these. It is just the same thing for us to be called to account for the one set of charges as for the other, so far as concerns the fact that they have no basis for them in anything that we have said. How could one who says distinctly that the true Son was in the glory of the Father, insult the eternal glory of the Only-begotten by conceiving it to have been \"in the form of a servant\"?

But even the infants, not personally in their own life, but according to the common origin of the human race, have all broken God's covenant in that one in whom all have sinned.[fn-28-P2895_1617653:66-nf] Now there are many things called God's covenants besides those two great ones, the old and the new, which any one who pleases may read and know. For the first covenant, which was made with the first man, is just this: \"In the day ye eat thereof, ye shall surely die.\"[fn-28-P2896_1617942:67-nf] Whence it is written in the book called Ecclesiasticus, \"All flesh waxeth old as doth a garment. For the covenant from the beginning is, Thou shall die the death.\"[fn-28-P2897_1618123:68-nf] Now, as the law was more plainly given afterward, and the apostle says, \"Where no law is, there is no prevarication,\"[fn-28-P2898_1618262:69-nf] on what supposition is what is said in the psalm true, \"I accounted all the sinners of the earth prevaricators,\"[fn-28-P2899_1618393:70-nf] except that all who are held liable for any sin are accused of dealing deceitfully (prevaricating) with some law? If on this account, then, even the infants are, according to the true belief, born in sin, not actual but original, so that we confess they have need of grace for the remission of sins, certainly it must be acknowledged that in the same sense in which they are sinners they are also prevaricators of that law which was given in Paradise, according to the truth of both scriptures, \"I accounted all the sinners of the earth prevaricators,\" and \"Where no law is, there is no prevarication.\" And thus, because circumcision was the sign of regeneration, and the infant, on account of the original sin by which God's covenant was first broken, was not undeservedly to lose his generation unless delivered by regeneration, these divine words are to be understood as if it had been said, Whoever is not born again, that soul shall perish from his people, because he hath broken my covenant, since he also has sinned in Adam with all others. For had He said, Because he hath broken this my covenant, He would have compelled us to understand by it only this of circumcision; but since He has not expressly said what covenant the infant has broken, we are free to understand Him as speaking of that covenant of which the breach can be ascribed to an infant. Yet if any one contends that it is said of nothing else than circumcision, that in it the infant has broken the covenant of God because, he is not circumcised, he must seek some method of explanation by which it may be understood without absurdity (such as this) that he has broken the covenant, because it has been broken in him although not by him. Yet in this case also it is to be observed that the soul of the infant, being guilty of no sin of neglect against itself, would perish unjustly, unless original sin rendered it obnoxious to punishment.","title":"Book XVI","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":119,"verse":91,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_17_book_vi","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But we must return once more to our vehement writer of speeches, and take up again that severe invective of his against ourselves.

For it is thus that God teaches those who have been called according to His purpose, giving them simultaneously both to know what they ought to do, and to do what they know.

Although there are many who appear to do what the law commands, through fear of punishment, not through love of righteousness; and such righteousness as this the apostle calls \"his own which is after the law,\"-a thing as it were commanded, not given. When, indeed, it has been given, it is not called our own righteousness, but God's; because it becomes our own only so that we have it from God.

But if it be part of our religion to attribute to Him none of these things, then it is a sacred duty to use of Him names privative of the things abhorrent to His Nature, and to say all that we have so often enumerated already, viz. that He is imperishable, and unending, and ungenerate, and the other terms of that class, where the sense inherent in each only informs us of the privation of that which is obvious to our perception, but does not interpret the actual nature of that which is thus removed from those abhorrent conditions. What the Deity is not, the signification of these names does point out; but what that further thing, which is not these things, is essentially, remains undivulged. Moreover, even the rest of these names, the sense of which does indicate some position or some state, do not afford that indication of the Divine nature itself, but only of the results of our reverent speculations about it. For when we have concluded generally that no single thing existing, whether an object of sense or of thought, is formed spontaneously or fortuitously, but that everything discoverable in the world is linked to the Being Who transcends all existences, and possesses there the source of its continuance, and we then perceive the beauty and the majesty of the wonderful sights in creation, we thus get from these and such-like marks a new range of thoughts about the Deity, and interpret each one of the thoughts thus arising within us by a special name, following the advice of Wisdom, who says that \"by the greatness and beauty of the creatures proportionately the Maker of them is seen[fn-24-P2403_1645199:137-nf] .\" We address therefore as Creator Him Who has made all mortal things, and as Almighty Him Who has compassed so vast a creation, Whose might has been able to realize His wish. When too we perceive the good that is in our own life, we give in accordance with this the name of Good to Him Who is our life's first cause. Then also having learnt from the Divine writings the incorruptibility of the judgment to come, we therefore call Him Judge and Just, and to sum up in one word, we transfer the thoughts that arise within us about the Divine Being into the mould of a corresponding name; so that there is no appellation given to the Divine Being apart from some distinct intuition about Him. Even the word God (Qeoj) we understand to have come into usage from the activity of His seeing; for our faith tells us that the Deity is everywhere, and sees (qeasqai) all things, and penetrates all things, and then we stamp this thought with this name (Qeoj), guided to it by the Holy Voice. For he who says, \"O God, attend unto me[fn-24-P2404_1646246:138-nf] ,\" and, \"Look, O God[fn-24-P2405_1646285:139-nf] ,\" and, \"God knoweth the secrets of the heart plainly[fn-24-P2406_1646361:140-nf] ,\" reveals the latent meaning of this word, viz. that Qeoj is so called from qeasqai. For there is no difference between saying \"Attend unto,\" \"Look,\" and \"See.\" Since, then, the seer must look towards some sight, God is rightly called the Seer of that which is to be seen. We are taught, then, by this word one sectional operation of the Divine Being, though we do not grasp in thought by means of it His substance itself, believing nevertheless that the Divine glory suffers no loss because of our being at a loss for a naturally appropriate name.

Be it said then that some sins are great, some small, because it is true; and let us not listen to the Stoics who maintain all to be equal: but to say that some sins are unjust, some just, what else is it than to say that there be some unjust, some just iniquities?

Indeed, the truth about the image could never have been maintained if the beauty reflected in that image had been in the slightest degree opposed[fn-27-P2751_1876176:68-nf] to the Archetypal Beauty. Passion was introduced afterwards, subsequent to man's first organization; and it was in this way. Being the image and the likeness, as has been said, of the Power which rules all things, man kept also in the matter of a Free-Will this likeness to Him whose Will is over all. He was enslaved to no outward necessity whatever; his feeling towards that which pleased him depended only on his own private judgment; he was free to choose whatever he liked; and so he was a free agent, though circumvented with cunning, when he drew upon himself that disaster which now overwhelms humanity. He became himself the discoverer of evil, but he did not therein discover what God had made; for God did not make death.

All who have the faculty of sight may enjoy equally the sunlight; and any one can if he likes put this enjoyment from him by shutting his eyes: in that case it is not that the sun retires and produces that darkness, but the man himself puts a barrier between his eye and the sunshine; the faculty of vision cannot indeed, even in the closing of the eyes, remain inactive[fn-27-P2752_1877419:69-nf] , and so this operative sight necessarily becomes an operative darkness[fn-27-P2753_1877504:70-nf] rising up in the man from his own free act in ceasing to see. Again, a man in building a house for himself may omit to make in it any way of entrance for the light; he will necessarily be in darkness, though he cuts himself off from the light voluntarily. So the first man on the earth, or rather he who generated evil in man, had for choice the Good and the Beautiful lying all around him in the very nature of things; yet he wilfully cut out a new way for himself against this nature, and in the act of turning away from virtue, which was his own free act, he created the usage of evil. For, be it observed, there is no such thing in the world as evil irrespective of a will, and discoverable in a substance apart from that. Every creature of God is good, and nothing of His \"to be rejected\"; all that God made was \"very good[fn-27-P2754_1878356:71-nf] .\" But the habit of sinning entered as we have described, and with fatal quickness, into the life of man; and from that small beginning spread into this infinitude of evil. Then that godly beauty of the soul which was an imitation of the Archetypal Beauty, like fine steel blackened[fn-27-P2755_1878669:72-nf] with the vicious rust, preserved no longer the glory of its familiar essence, but was disfigured with the ugliness of sin. This thing so great and precious[fn-27-P2756_1878843:73-nf] , as the Scripture calls him, this being man, has fallen from his proud birthright. As those who have slipped and fallen heavily into mud, and have all their features so besmeared with it, that their nearest friends do not recognize them, so this creature has fallen into the mire of sin and lost the blessing of being an image of the imperishable Deity; he has clothed himself instead with a perishable and foul resemblance to something else; and this Reason counsels him to put away again by washing it off in the cleansing water of this calling[fn-27-P2757_1879651:74-nf] . The earthly envelopment once removed, the soul's beauty will again appear. Now the putting off of a strange accretion is equivalent to the return to that which is familiar and natural; yet such a return cannot be but by again becoming that which in the beginning we were created. In fact this likeness to the divine is not our work at all; it is not the achievement of any faculty of man; it is the great gift of God bestowed upon our nature at the very moment of our birth; human efforts can only go so far as to clear away the filth of sin, and so cause the buried beauty of the soul to shine forth again. This truth is, I think, taught in the Gospel, when our Lord says, to those who can hear what Wisdom speaks beneath a mystery, that \"the Kingdom of God is within you[fn-27-P2758_1880490:75-nf] .\" That word[fn-27-P2759_1880526:76-nf] points out the fact that the Divine good is not something apart from our nature, and is not removed far away from those who have the will to seek it; it is in fact within each of us, ignored indeed, and unnoticed while it is stifled beneath the cares and pleasures of life, but found again whenever we can turn our power of conscious thinking towards it. If further confirmation of what we say is required, I think it will be found in what is suggested by our Lord in the searching for the Lost Drachma[fn-27-P2760_1881122:77-nf] . The thought, there, is that the widowed soul reaps no benefit from the other virtues (called drachmas in the Parable) being all of them found safe, if that one other is not amongst them. The Parable therefore suggests that a candle should first be lit, signifying doubtless our reason which throws light on hidden principles; then that in one's own house, that is, within oneself, we should search for that lost coin; and by that coin the Parable doubtless hints at the image of our King, not yet hopelessly lost, but hidden beneath the dirt; and by this last we must understand the impurities of the flesh, which, being swept and purged away by carefulness of life, leave clear to the view the object of our search. Then it is meant that the soul herself who finds this rejoices over it, and with her the neighbours, whom she calls in to share with her in this delight. Verily, all those powers which are the housemates of the soul, and which the Parable names her neighbours for this occasion[fn-27-P2761_1882139:78-nf] , when so be that the image of the mighty King is revealed in all its brightness at last (that image which the Fashioner of each individual heart of us has stamped upon this our Drachma[fn-27-P2762_1882335:79-nf] ), will then be converted to that divine delight and festivity, and will gaze upon the ineffable beauty of the recovered one. \"Rejoice with me,\" she says, \"because I have found the Drachma which I had lost.\" The neighbours, that is, the soul's familiar powers, both the reasoning and the appetitive, the affections of grief and of anger, and all the rest that are discerned in her, at that joyful feast which celebrates the finding of the heavenly Drachma are well called her friends also; and it is meet that they should all rejoice in the Lord when they all look towards the Beautiful and the Good, and do everything for the glory of God, no longer instruments of sin[fn-27-P2763_1883036:80-nf] . If, then, such is the lesson of this Finding of the lost, viz. that we should restore the divine image from the foulness which the flesh wraps round it to its primitive state, let us become that which the First Man was at the moment when he first breathed. And what was that? Destitute he was then of his covering of dead skins, but he could gaze without shrinking upon God's countenance. He did not yet judge of what was lovely by taste or sight; he found in the Lord alone all that was sweet; and he used the helpmeet given him only for this delight, as Scripture signifies when it said that \"he knew her not[fn-27-P2764_1883667:81-nf] \" till he was driven forth from the garden, and till she, for the sin which she was decoyed into committing, was sentenced to the pangs of childbirth. We, then, who in our first ancestor were thus ejected, are allowed to return to our earliest state of blessedness by the very same stages by which we lost Paradise. What are they? Pleasure, craftily offered, began the Fall, and there followed after pleasure shame, and fear, even to remain longer in the sight of their Creator, so that they hid themselves in leaves and shade; and after that they covered themselves with the skins of dead animals; and then were sent forth into this pestilential and exacting land where, as the compensation for having to die, marriage was instituted[fn-27-P2765_1884419:82-nf] . Now if we are destined \"to depart hence, and be with Christ[fn-27-P2766_1884500:83-nf] ,\" we must begin at the end of the route of departure (which ties nearest to ourselves); just as those who have travelled far from their friends at home, when they turn to reach again the place from which they started, first leave that district which they reached at the end of their outward journey. Marriage, then, is the last stage of our separation from the life that was led in Paradise; marriage therefore, as our discourse has been suggesting, is the first thing to be left; it is the first station as it were for our departure to Christ. Next, we must retire from all anxious toil upon the land, such as man was bound to after his sin. Next we must divest ourselves of those coverings of our nakedness, the coats of skins, namely the wisdom of the flesh; we must renounce all shameful things done in secret[fn-27-P2767_1885336:84-nf] , and be covered no longer with the fig-leaves of this bitter world; then, when we have torn off the coatings of this life's perishable leaves, we must stand again in the sight of our Creator; and repelling all the illusion of taste and sight, take for our guide God's commandment only, instead of the venom-spitting serpent. That commandment was, to touch nothing but what was Good, and to leave what was evil untasted; because impatience to remain any longer in ignorance of evil would be but the beginning of the long train of actual evil. For this reason it was forbidden to our first parents to grasp the knowledge of the opposite to the good, as well as that of the good itself; they were to keep themselves from \"the knowledge of good and evil[fn-27-P2768_1886106:85-nf] ,\" and to enjoy the Good in its purity, unmixed with one particle of evil: and to enjoy that, is in my judgment nothing else than to be ever with God, and to feel ceaselessly and continually this delight, unalloyed by aught that could tear us away from it. One might even be bold to say that this might be found the way by which a man could be again caught up into Paradise out of this world which lieth in the Evil, into that Paradise where Paul was when he saw the unspeakable sights which it is not lawful for a man to talk of[fn-27-P2769_1886654:86-nf] .","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":119,"verse":73,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_31_on_virginity","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"This reasoning and intelligent creature, man, at once the work and the likeness of the Divine and Imperishable Mind (for so in the Creation it is written of him that \"God made man in His image[fn-27-P2750_1875856:67-nf] \"), this creature, I say, did not in the course of his first production have united to the very essence of his nature the liability to passion and to death.

So the first man on the earth, or rather he who generated evil in man, had for choice the Good and the Beautiful lying all around him in the very nature of things; yet he wilfully cut out a new way for himself against this nature, and in the act of turning away from virtue, which was his own free act, he created the usage of evil. For, be it observed, there is no such thing in the world as evil irrespective of a will, and discoverable in a substance apart from that. Every creature of God is good, and nothing of His \"to be rejected\"; all that God made was \"very good[fn-27-P2754_1878356:71-nf] .\" But the habit of sinning entered as we have described, and with fatal quickness, into the life of man; and from that small beginning spread into this infinitude of evil. Then that godly beauty of the soul which was an imitation of the Archetypal Beauty, like fine steel blackened[fn-27-P2755_1878669:72-nf] with the vicious rust, preserved no longer the glory of its familiar essence, but was disfigured with the ugliness of sin. This thing so great and precious[fn-27-P2756_1878843:73-nf] , as the Scripture calls him, this being man, has fallen from his proud birthright. As those who have slipped and fallen heavily into mud, and have all their features so besmeared with it, that their nearest friends do not recognize them, so this creature has fallen into the mire of sin and lost the blessing of being an image of the imperishable Deity; he has clothed himself instead with a perishable and foul resemblance to something else; and this Reason counsels him to put away again by washing it off in the cleansing water of this calling[fn-27-P2757_1879651:74-nf] . The earthly envelopment once removed, the soul's beauty will again appear. Now the putting off of a strange accretion is equivalent to the return to that which is familiar and natural; yet such a return cannot be but by again becoming that which in the beginning we were created. In fact this likeness to the divine is not our work at all; it is not the achievement of any faculty of man; it is the great gift of God bestowed upon our nature at the very moment of our birth; human efforts can only go so far as to clear away the filth of sin, and so cause the buried beauty of the soul to shine forth again. This truth is, I think, taught in the Gospel, when our Lord says, to those who can hear what Wisdom speaks beneath a mystery, that \"the Kingdom of God is within you[fn-27-P2758_1880490:75-nf] .\" That word[fn-27-P2759_1880526:76-nf] points out the fact that the Divine good is not something apart from our nature, and is not removed far away from those who have the will to seek it; it is in fact within each of us, ignored indeed, and unnoticed while it is stifled beneath the cares and pleasures of life, but found again whenever we can turn our power of conscious thinking towards it. If further confirmation of what we say is required, I think it will be found in what is suggested by our Lord in the searching for the Lost Drachma[fn-27-P2760_1881122:77-nf] . The thought, there, is that the widowed soul reaps no benefit from the other virtues (called drachmas in the Parable) being all of them found safe, if that one other is not amongst them. The Parable therefore suggests that a candle should first be lit, signifying doubtless our reason which throws light on hidden principles; then that in one's own house, that is, within oneself, we should search for that lost coin; and by that coin the Parable doubtless hints at the image of our King, not yet hopelessly lost, but hidden beneath the dirt; and by this last we must understand the impurities of the flesh, which, being swept and purged away by carefulness of life, leave clear to the view the object of our search. Then it is meant that the soul herself who finds this rejoices over it, and with her the neighbours, whom she calls in to share with her in this delight. Verily, all those powers which are the housemates of the soul, and which the Parable names her neighbours for this occasion[fn-27-P2761_1882139:78-nf] , when so be that the image of the mighty King is revealed in all its brightness at last (that image which the Fashioner of each individual heart of us has stamped upon this our Drachma[fn-27-P2762_1882335:79-nf] ), will then be converted to that divine delight and festivity, and will gaze upon the ineffable beauty of the recovered one. \"Rejoice with me,\" she says, \"because I have found the Drachma which I had lost.\" The neighbours, that is, the soul's familiar powers, both the reasoning and the appetitive, the affections of grief and of anger, and all the rest that are discerned in her, at that joyful feast which celebrates the finding of the heavenly Drachma are well called her friends also; and it is meet that they should all rejoice in the Lord when they all look towards the Beautiful and the Good, and do everything for the glory of God, no longer instruments of sin[fn-27-P2763_1883036:80-nf] . If, then, such is the lesson of this Finding of the lost, viz. that we should restore the divine image from the foulness which the flesh wraps round it to its primitive state, let us become that which the First Man was at the moment when he first breathed. And what was that? Destitute he was then of his covering of dead skins, but he could gaze without shrinking upon God's countenance. He did not yet judge of what was lovely by taste or sight; he found in the Lord alone all that was sweet; and he used the helpmeet given him only for this delight, as Scripture signifies when it said that \"he knew her not[fn-27-P2764_1883667:81-nf] \" till he was driven forth from the garden, and till she, for the sin which she was decoyed into committing, was sentenced to the pangs of childbirth. We, then, who in our first ancestor were thus ejected, are allowed to return to our earliest state of blessedness by the very same stages by which we lost Paradise. What are they? Pleasure, craftily offered, began the Fall, and there followed after pleasure shame, and fear, even to remain longer in the sight of their Creator, so that they hid themselves in leaves and shade; and after that they covered themselves with the skins of dead animals; and then were sent forth into this pestilential and exacting land where, as the compensation for having to die, marriage was instituted[fn-27-P2765_1884419:82-nf] . Now if we are destined \"to depart hence, and be with Christ[fn-27-P2766_1884500:83-nf] ,\" we must begin at the end of the route of departure (which ties nearest to ourselves); just as those who have travelled far from their friends at home, when they turn to reach again the place from which they started, first leave that district which they reached at the end of their outward journey. Marriage, then, is the last stage of our separation from the life that was led in Paradise; marriage therefore, as our discourse has been suggesting, is the first thing to be left; it is the first station as it were for our departure to Christ. Next, we must retire from all anxious toil upon the land, such as man was bound to after his sin. Next we must divest ourselves of those coverings of our nakedness, the coats of skins, namely the wisdom of the flesh; we must renounce all shameful things done in secret[fn-27-P2767_1885336:84-nf] , and be covered no longer with the fig-leaves of this bitter world; then, when we have torn off the coatings of this life's perishable leaves, we must stand again in the sight of our Creator; and repelling all the illusion of taste and sight, take for our guide God's commandment only, instead of the venom-spitting serpent. That commandment was, to touch nothing but what was Good, and to leave what was evil untasted; because impatience to remain any longer in ignorance of evil would be but the beginning of the long train of actual evil. For this reason it was forbidden to our first parents to grasp the knowledge of the opposite to the good, as well as that of the good itself; they were to keep themselves from \"the knowledge of good and evil[fn-27-P2768_1886106:85-nf] ,\" and to enjoy the Good in its purity, unmixed with one particle of evil: and to enjoy that, is in my judgment nothing else than to be ever with God, and to feel ceaselessly and continually this delight, unalloyed by aught that could tear us away from it. One might even be bold to say that this might be found the way by which a man could be again caught up into Paradise out of this world which lieth in the Evil, into that Paradise where Paul was when he saw the unspeakable sights which it is not lawful for a man to talk of[fn-27-P2769_1886654:86-nf] .","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":119,"verse":127,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_31_on_virginity","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"64","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Let that which was then said by our Lord be the general maxim for every life; especially let it be the maxim for those who are coming nearer God through the gateway of virginity, that they should never in watching for a perfection in one direction present an unguarded side in another and contrary one; but should in all directions realize the good, so that they may guarantee in all things their holy life against failure.

One stone, indeed, is no more the whole edifice of the Tower, than one commandment kept will raise the soul's perfection to the required height.

What else is this than to say nothing, and yet to contradict? Unless perchance, they have given some reason to you for the view that they have taken, which reason you have preferred to say nothing about in your letters. But what that reason can be I do not know. Whether, possibly, since we have shown that God has so acted on the hearts of men, and has induced the wills of those whom He pleased to this point, that Saul or David should be established as king,-do they not think that these instances are appropriate to this subject, because to reign in this world temporally is not the same thing as to reign eternally with God? And so do they suppose that God inclines the wills of those whom He pleases to the attainment of earthly kingdoms, but does not incline them to the attainment of a heavenly kingdom? But I think that it was in reference to the kingdom of heaven, and not to an earthly kingdom, that it was said, \"Incline my heart unto Thy testimonies;[fn-69-P6918_2645564:138-nf] or, \"The steps of a man are ordered by the Lord, and He will will His way;\"[fn-69-P6919_2645661:139-nf] )or, \"The will is prepared by the Lord;\"[fn-69-P6920_2645725:140-nf] or, \"Let our Lord be with us as with our fathers; let Him not forsake us, nor turn Himself away from us; let Him incline our hearts unto Him, that we may walk in all His ways;\"[fn-69-P6921_2645933:141-nf] or, \"I will give them a heart to know me, and earn that hear;\"[fn-69-P6922_2646020:142-nf] or, \"I will give them another heart, and a new spirit will I give them.\"[fn-69-P6923_2646115:143-nf] Let them also hear this, \"I will give my Spirit within you, and I will cause you to walk in my righteousness; and ye shall observe my judgments, and do them.\"[fn-69-P6924_2646295:144-nf] Let them heal \"Man's goings are directed by the Lord, and how can a man understand His ways?\"[fn-69-P6925_2646413:145-nf] Let them hear, \"Every man seemeth right to himself, but the Lord directeth the hearts.\"[fn-69-P6926_2646522:146-nf] Let them hear, \"As many as were ordained to eternal life believed \"[fn-69-P6927_2646612:147-nf] Let them hear these passages, and whatever others of the kind I have not mentioned in which God is declared to prepare and to convert men's wills, even for the kingdom of heaven and for eternal life.

But when some rather carelessly abused this indulgence and prolonged their time for sleep too long, as they were not obliged by the requirements of any service to leave their cells or rise from their beds till the third hour; and when, as well as losing their labour, they were drowsy from excess of sleep in the daytime, when they ought to have been applying themselves to some duties, (especially on those days when an unusually oppressive weariness was caused by their keeping watch from the evening till the approach of morning), a complaint was brought to the Elders by some of the brethren who were ardent in spirit and in no slight measure disturbed by this carelessness, and it was determined by them after long discussion and anxious consideration that up till sunrise, when they could without harm be ready to read or to undertake manual labour, time for rest should be given to their wearied bodies, and after this they should all be summoned to the observance of this service and should rise from their beds, and by reciting three Psalms andprayers (after the order anciently fixed for the observance of Tierce and Sext, to signify the confession of the Trinity)[fn-21-P2147_927758:20-nf] should at the same time by an uniform arrangement put an end to their sleep and make a beginning to their work.

First, he calls him a crow and says that he is black all over; then he calls him a jackdaw who decks himself in other birds' showy feathers; and then he rends him with his foul abuse, and declares that there is nothing manly in a man whom God has singled out to be the glory of the churches of Christ who has[fn-89-P8964_2324731:53-nf] spoken of the testimonies of the Lord even in the sight of persecuting kings and has not been alarmed. The saintly Ambrose wrote his book on the Holy Spirit not in words only but with his own blood; for he offered his life-blood to his persecutors, and shed it within himself, although God preserved his life for future labours. Suppose that he did follow some of the Greek writers belonging to our Catholic body, and borrowed something from their writings, it should hardly have been the first thought in your mind, (still less the object of such zealous efforts as to make you set to work to translate the work of Didymus on the Holy Spirit,) to blaze abroad what you call his plagiarisms, which were very possibly the result of a literary necessity when he had to reply at once to some ravings of the heretics. Is this the fairness of a Christian? Is it thus that we are to observe the injunction of the Apostle,[fn-89-P8965_2325666:54-nf] \"Do nothing through faction or through vain glory\"? But I might turn the tables on you and ask,[fn-89-P8966_2325780:55-nf] Thou that sayest that a man should not steal, dost thou steal? I might quote a fact I have already mentioned, namely, that, a little before you wrote your commentary on Micah, you had been accused of plagiarizing from Origen. And you did not deny it, but said: \"What they bring against me in violent abuse I accept as the highest praise; for I wish to imitate the man whom we and all who are wise admire.\" Your plagiarisms redound to your highest praise; those of others make them crows and jackdaws in your estimation. If yon act rightly in imitating Origen whom you call second only to the Apostles, why do you sharply attack another for following Didymus, whom nevertheless you point to by name as a Prophet and an apostolic man? For myself I must not complain, since you abuse us all alike. First you do not spare Ambrose, great and highly esteemed as he was; then the man of whom you write that he was second only to the Apostles, and that all the wise admire him, and whom you have praised up to the skies a thousand times over, not as you say in two, but in innumerable places, this man who was before an Apostle, you now turn round and make a heretic.

I do not know whence you received this rod. I know that Christ once gave the keys to Peter: but what spirit it is who now dispenses these censors' rods, it is for you to say. However, if you condemn all those I have mentioned with the same mouth with which you once praised them, I who in comparison of them am but like a flea, must not complain, I repeat, if now you tear me to pieces, though once you praised me, and in your Chronicle[fn-89-P8968_2327805:57-nf] equalled me to Florentius and Bonosus for the nobleness, as you said, of my life.","title":"Book II.","author":"Rufinus"},{"chapter":119,"verse":105,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_38_letter_of_an_inquirer_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"§10.

For he that forsakes the Church, how is he in Christ who is not in the members of Christ? How is he in Christ who is not in the body of Christ? Those therefore take scandal, or, occasion of failing, who forsake Christ or the Church. Whence do we understand that the Psalm in saying, \"By day shall the sun not burn thee, nor the moon by night,\" saith it of this, that the burning means scandal, or occasion of stumbling? In the first place mark the similitude itself. Just as the person whom something is burning saith, I cannot bear it, I cannot away with it, and draws back; so those persons who cannot bear some things in the Church, and withdraw themselves either from the name of Christ or from the Church, are taking scandal. For see how those took scandal as from the sun, those carnal ones to whom Christ preached of His flesh, saying, \"He that eateth not the flesh of the Son of Man and drinketh His blood, shall have no life in him.\"[fn-40-P4031_2216272:63-nf] Some seventy persons[fn-40-P4032_2216314:64-nf] said, \"Thisis an hard saying,\" and went back from Him, and there remained the twelve. All those the sun burnt, and they went back, not being able to bear the force of the Word. There remained therefore the twelve. And lest haply men should imagine that they confer a benefit upon Christ by believing on Christ, and not that the benefit is conferred by Him upon them; when the twelve were left, the Lord said to them, \"Will ye also go?\" That ye may know that I am necessary to you, not ye to me. But those whom the sun had not burnt, answered by the voice of Peter: \"Lord, Thou hast the word[fn-40-P4033_2217969:65-nf] of eternal life; whither shall we go?\" But who are they that the Church as the moon burneth by night? They that have made schisms. Hear the very word used in the apostle: \"Who is offended, and I burn not?\"[fn-40-P4034_2218188:66-nf] In what sense then is it, that there is no scandal or occasion of stumbling in him that loveth his brother? Because he that loveth his brother, beareth all things for unity's sake; because it is in the unity of charity that brotherly love exists. Some one, I know not who, offendeth thee: whether it be a bad man, or as thou supposest a bad man, or as thou pretendest a bad man: and dost thou desert so many good men? What sort of brotherly love is that which hath appeared in these[fn-40-P4035_2218691:67-nf] persons? While they accuse the Africans, they have deserted the whole world! What, were there no saints in the whole world? Or was it possible they should be condemned by you unheard? But oh! if ye loved your brethren, there would be none occasion of stumbling in you. Hear thou the Psalm, what it saith: \"Great peace have they that love Thy law, and there is to them none occasion of stumbling.\"[fn-40-P4036_2219104:68-nf] Great peace it saith there is for them that love the law of God, and that is why there is to them none occasion of stumbling. Those then who take scandal, or, occasion of stumbling, destroy peace. And of whom saith he that they take not and make not occasion of stumbling? They that love God's law. Consequently they are in charity. But some man will say, \"He said it of them that love God's law, not of the brethren.\" Hear thou what the Lord saith: \"A new commandment give I unto you that ye love one another.\"[fn-40-P4037_2219636:69-nf] What is the Law but commandment? Moreover, how is it they do not take occasion of stumbling, but because they forbear one another? As Paul saith, \"Forbearing one another in love, studying to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.\"[fn-40-P4038_2219900:70-nf] And to show that this is the law of Christ, hear the same apostle commending this very law. \"Bear ye one another's burdens,\" saith he, \"and so shall ye fulfill the law of Christ.\"[fn-40-P4039_2220100:71-nf] ","title":"Homily I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":119,"verse":62,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_53_book_ii_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"139","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Especially is a moderate softness in the bed suitable for manhood; for sleep ought not to be for the total enervation of the body, but for its relaxation.

For I would that some one would tell me how they \"crept into the garden enclosed and the fountain sealed,\" of whom Cyprian bears witness that they renounced the world in word and not in deed, and that yet they were within the Church. For if they both are themselves there, and are themselves the bride of Christ, can she then be as she is described \"without spot or wrinkle,\"[fn-38-P3821_2102069:102-nf] and is the fair dove defiled with such a portion of her members? Are these the thorns among which she is a lily, as it is said in the same Song?[fn-38-P3822_2102233:103-nf] So far therefore, as the lily extends, so far does \"the garden enclosed and the fountain sealed,\" namely, through all those just persons who are Jews inwardly in the circumcision of the heart[fn-38-P3823_2102444:104-nf] (for\" the king's daughter is all glorious within\"[fn-38-P3824_2102514:105-nf] ), in whom is the fixed number of the saints predestined before the foundation of the world. But that multitude of thorns, whether in secret or in open separation, is pressing on it from without, above number. \"If I would declare them,\" it is said, \"and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.\"[fn-38-P3825_2102840:106-nf] The number, therefore, of the just persons, \"who are the called according to His purpose,\"[fn-38-P3826_2102949:107-nf] of whom it is said, \"The Lord knoweth them that are His,\"[fn-38-P3827_2103029:108-nf] is itself \"the garden enclosed, the fountain sealed, a well of living water, the orchard of pomegranates with pleasant fruits.\" Of this number some live according to the Spirit, and enter on the excellent way of charity; and when they \"restore a man that is overtaken in a fault in the spirit of meekness, they consider themselves, lest they also be tempted.\"[fn-38-P3828_2103411:109-nf] And when it happens that they also are themselves overtaken, the affection of charity is but a little checked, and not extinguished; and again rising up and being kindled afresh, it is restored to its former course. For they know how to say, \"My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto Thy word.\"[fn-38-P3829_2103749:110-nf] But when \"in anything they be otherwise minded, God shallreveal even this unto them,\"[fn-38-P3830_2103856:111-nf] if they abide in the burning flame of charity, and do not break the bond of peace. But some who are yet carnal, and full of fleshly appetites, are instant in working out their progress; and that they may become fit for heavenly food,they are nourished with the milk of the holy mysteries, they avoid in the fear of God whatever is manifestly corrupt even in the opinion of the world, and they strive most watchfully that they may be less and less delighted with worldly and temporal matters. They observe most constantly the rule of faith which has been sought out with diligence; and if in aught they stray from it, they submit to speedy correction under Catholic authority, although, in Cyprian's words, they be tossed about, by reason of their fleshly appetite, with the various conflicts of phantasies. There are some also who as yet live wickedly, or even lie in heresies or the superstitions of the Gentiles, and yet even then \"the Lord knoweth them that are His.\" For, in that unspeakable foreknowledge of God, many who seem to be without are in reality within, and many who seem to be within yet really are without. Of all those, therefore, who, if I may so say, are inwardly and secretly within, is that \"enclosed garden\" composed, \"the fountain sealed, a well of living water, the orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits.\" The divinely imparted gifts of these are partly peculiar to themselves, as in this world the charity that never faileth, and in the world to come eternal life; partly they are common with evil and perverse men, as all the other things in which consist the holy mysteries.","title":"Book V.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":119,"verse":85,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_141_homily_x_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"4. And by what do we know that we love the sons of God? By this, \"that we love God, and do His commandments.\" We sigh here, by reason of the hardness of doing the commandments of God. Hear what follows. O man, at what toilest thou in loving? In loving avarice. With toil is that loved which thou lovest: there is no toil in loving God. Avarice will enjoin thee labors, perils, sore hardships and tribulations; and thou wilt do its bidding. To what end? That thou mayest have that with which thou shalt fill thy chest, and lose thy peace of mind. Thou didst feel thyself haply more secure before thou hadst it, than since thou didst begin to have. See what avarice has enjoined thee. Thou hast filled thine house, and art in dread of robbers; hast gotten gold, lost thy sleep. See what avarice has enjoined thee. Do, and thou didst. What does God enjoin thee! Love me. Thou lovest gold, thou wilt seek gold, and perchance not find it: whoso seeks me, I am with him. Thou wilt love honor, and perchance not attain unto it: who ever loved me, and did not attain? God saith to thee, thou wouldest make thee a patron, or a powerful friend: thou seekest a way to his favor by means of another inferior. Love me, saith God to thee: favor with me is not had by making interest with some other: thy love itself makes me present to thee. What sweeter than this love, brethren? It is not without reason that ye heard just now in the Psalm, \"The unrighteous told me of delights,[fn-46-P4638_2501417:14-nf] but not as is Thy law, O Lord.\"[fn-46-P4639_2501508:15-nf] What is the Law of God?

That \"new commandment,\" which is called new because it maketh new: \"A new commandment give I unto you, that ye love one another.\"[fn-46-P4640_2501737:16-nf] Hear because this is the law of God. The apostle saith, \"Bear ye one another's burdens, and so shall ye fulfill the law of Christ.\"[fn-46-P4641_2501889:17-nf] This, even this, is the consummation of all our works; Love.

Ye have heard in the Psalm, \"I have seen the end of all perfection.[fn-46-P4643_2502125:18-nf] He hath said, I have seen the end of all perfection: what had he seen? Think we, had he ascended to the peak of some very high and pointed mountain, and looked out thence and seen the compass of the earth, and the circles of the round world, and therefore said, \"I have seen the end of all perfection\"? If this be a thing to be praised, let us ask of the Lord eyes of the flesh so sharp-sighted, that we shall but require some exceeding high mountain on earth, that from its summit we may see the end of all perfection. Go not far: lo, I say to thee, it is here; ascend the mountain, and see the end. Christ is the Mountain; come to Christ: thou seest thence the end of all perfection. What is this end? Ask Paul: \"But the end of the, commandment is charity, from a pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned:\"[fn-46-P4644_2502983:19-nf] and in another place, \"Charity is the fullness,\" or fulfillment, \"of the law.\" What so finished and terminated as \"fullness\"? For, brethren, the apostle here uses end in a way of praise. Think not of consumption, but of consummation. For it is in one sense that one says, I have finished my bread, in another, I have finished my coat. I have finished the bread, by eating it: the coat, by making it. In both places the word is \"end,\" \"finish:\" but the bread is finished by its being consumed, the coat is finished by being made: the bread, so as to be no more; the coat, so as to be complete. Therefore in this sense take ye also this word, end, when the Psalm is read and ye hear it said, \"On the end, a Psalm of David.\"[fn-46-P4645_2503723:20-nf] Ye are for ever hearing this in the Psalms, and ye should know what ye hear. What meaneth, \"Onthe end\"?-\"For Christ is the end of the law unto every one that believeth.\"[fn-46-P4646_2503924:21-nf] And what meaneth, \"Christ is the end\"? Because Christ is God, and \"the end of the commandment is charity,\" and \"Charity is God:\" because Father and Son and Holy Ghost are One. There is He the End to thee; elsewhere He is the Way. Do not stick fast in the way, and so never come to the end. Whatever else thou come to, pass beyond it, until thou come to the end. What is the end? It is good for me to \"hold me fast in God.\"[fn-46-P4647_2504367:22-nf] Hast thou laid fast hold on God? thou hast finished the way: thou shall abide in thine own country. Mark well! Some man seeks money: let not it be the end to thee: pass on, as a traveller in a strange land. But if thou love it, thou art entangled by avarice; avarice will be shackles to thy feet: thou canst make no more progress. Pass therefore this also: seek the end. Thou seekest health of the body: still do not stop there. For what is it, this health of the body, which death makes an end of, which sickness debilitates, a feeble, mortal, fleeting thing? Seek that, indeed, lest haply ill-health hinder thy good works: but for that very reason, the end is not there, for it is sought in order to something else. Whatever is sought in order to something else, the end is not there: whatever is loved for its own sake, and freely, the end is there. Thou seekest honors; perchance seekest them in order to do something, that thou mayest accomplish something, and so please God: love not the honor itself, lest thou stop there. Seekest thou praise? If thou seek God's, thou doest well; if thou seek thine own, thou doest ill; thou stoppest short in the way. But behold, thou art loved, art praised: think it not joy when in thyself thou art praised; be thou praised in the Lord, that thou mayest sing, \"In the Lord shall my soul be praised.\"[fn-46-P4648_2505733:23-nf] Thou deliverest some good discourse, and thy discourse is praised. Let it not be praised as thine, the end is not there. If thou set the end there, there is an end of thee: but an end, not that thou be perfected, but that thou be consumed. Then let not thy discourse be praised as coming from thee, as being thine. But how praised? As the Psalm saith, \"In God will I praise the discourse, in God will I praise the word.\"[fn-46-P4649_2506173:24-nf] Hereby shall that which there follows come to pass in thee: \"In God have I hoped, I will not fear what man can do unto me.\"[fn-46-P4650_2506341:25-nf] For when all things that are thine are praised in God, no fear lest thy praise be lost, since God faileth not.

For when the prophet says, \"Open Thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law,\"[fn-110-P11022_2967394:76-nf] or, \"the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes,\"[fn-110-P11023_2967479:77-nf] or, \"Lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death,\"[fn-110-P11024_2967554:78-nf] no one is so foolish as to suppose that the eyes of the body behold the wonders of the divine law, or that the law of the Lord gives light to the bodily eyes, or that the sleep of death falls on the eyes of the body. When our Saviour says, \"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear,\"[fn-110-P11025_2967855:79-nf] any one will understand that the ears spoken of are of a diviner kind. When it is said that the word of the Lord was \"in the hand\" of Jeremiah or of some other prophet; or when the expression is used, \"the law by the hand of Moses,\" or, \"I sought the Lord with my hands, and was not deceived,[fn-110-P11026_2968168:80-nf] -no one is so foolish as not to see that the word \"hands\" is taken figuratively, as when John says, \"Our hands have handled the Word of life.\"[fn-110-P11027_2968353:81-nf] And if you wish further to learn from the sacred writings that there is a diviner sense than the senses of the body, you have only to hear what Solomon says, \"Thou shalt find a divine sense.\"[fn-110-P11028_2968563:82-nf] ","title":"Book VII.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":119,"verse":73,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_34_de_decretis_or_defence_of_the_nicene_definition","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"28","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"9.

And God Himself declares this to Jeremiah, as I said before; `Before I formed thee in the womb, I knew thee[fn-32-P3263_1285190:51-nf] ;' and so He says of all, `All those things hath My hand made[fn-32-P3264_1285268:52-nf] ;' and again by Isaiah, `Thus saith the Lord, thy redeemer, and He that formed thee from the womb, I am the Lord that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by Myself[fn-32-P3265_1285506:53-nf] .'

The divine lessons, which we have just heard as they were being read, warn us to gather in a stock of virtues, to fortify a Christian heart, against the offences which were predicted to come, and this from the mercy of the Lord. \"For what is man,\" saith Scripture, \"saving that Thou art mindful of him? \"[fn-43-P4381_1859076:1-nf] \"Woe unto the world because of offences,\"[fn-43-P4382_1859134:2-nf] saith the Lord; the Truth says so; He alarmeth and warneth us, He would not have us to be off our guard; for surely He would not make us desperate. Against this \"woe,\" against this evil, that is, which is to be feared, and dreaded, and guarded against, Scripture counsels, and exhorts, and instructs us in that place, where it is said, \"Great praise have they who love Thy law, and nothing is an offence to them.\"[fn-43-P4383_1859567:3-nf] He hath shown us an enemy to be guarded against, but He hath not omitted to show us also a wall of defence.

Therefore to avoid offences, whither wilt thou go beyond the world, unless thou fly to Him who made the world? And how shall we be able to fly to Him who made the world, unless we give ear to His law which is preached everywhere? And to give ear to it is but a small matter, unless we love it. For divine Scripture in making thee secure against offences doth not say, \"Great peace have they who\" hear \"Thy law.

And how did that little seed of generation draw together the many atoms that were to constitute Epicurus, and change some of them into skin and flesh for a covering, and make bone of others for erectness and strength, and form sinews of others for compact contexture? And how did it frame and adapt the many other members and parts-heart and bowels, and organs of sense, some within and some without-by which the body is made a thing of life? For of all these things there is not one either idle or useless: not even the meanest of them-the hair, or the nails, or such like-is so; but all have their service to do, and all their contribution to make, some of them to the soundness of bodily constitution, and others of them to beauty of appearance.

For whence is that which is said, \"seven times in a day will I praise thee\"?[fn-50-P5046_2146970:3-nf] Does a man sin who does not praise the Lord so often? What then is \"seven times will I praise,\" but \"I will never cease from praise\"? For he who says \"seven times,\" signifies all time. Whence inthis world there are continual revolutions of seven days. What then is \"seven times in a day will I praise Thee,\" but what is said in another place, \"His praise shall always be in my mouth\"?[fn-50-P5047_2147373:4-nf] With reference to this perfection, John writes to seven Churches. The Apocalypse is a book of St. John the Evangelist; and he writes\"to seven Churches.\"[fn-50-P5048_2147543:5-nf] Be ye hungered;[fn-50-P5049_2147573:6-nf] own ye these baskets.

Nor must we ask why the Word of God is not such as our word, considering God is not such as we, as has been before said; nor again is it right to seek how the word is from God, or how He is God's radiance, or how God besets, and what is the manner of His besetting[fn-60-P6088_2423473:236-nf] . For a man must be beside himself to venture on such points; since a thing ineffable and proper to God's nature, and known to Him alone and to the Son, this he demands to be explained in words. It is all one as if they sought where God is, and how God is, and of what nature the Father is. But as to ask such questions is irreligious, and argues an ignorance of God, so it is not holy to venture such questions concerning the generation of the Son of God, nor to measure God and His Wisdom by our own nature and infirmity. Nor is a person at liberty on that account to swerve in his thoughts from the truth, nor, if any one is perplexed in such inquiries, ought he to disbelieve what is written. For it is better in perplexity to be silent and believe, than to disbelieve on account of the perplexity: for he who is perplexed may in some way obtain mercy[fn-60-P6089_2424899:237-nf] , because, though he has questioned, he has yet kept quiet; but when a man is led by his perplexity into forming for himself doctrines which beseem not, and utters what is unworthy of God, such daring recurs a sentence without mercy. For in such perplexities divine Scripture is able to afford him some relief, so as to take rightly what is written, and to dwell upon our word as an illustration; that as it is proper to us and is from us, and not a work external to us, so also God's Word is proper to Him and from Him, and is not a work; and yet is not like the word of man, or else we must suppose God to be man. For observe, many and various are men's words which pass away day by day; because those that come before others continue not, but vanish. Now this happens because their authors are men, and have seasons which pass away, and ideas which are successive; and what strikes them first and second, that they utter; so that they have many words, and yet after them all nothing at all remaining; for the speaker ceases, and his word forthwith is spent. But God's Word is one and the same, and, as it is written, `The Word of God endureth for ever[fn-60-P6090_2426129:238-nf] ,' not changed, not before or after other, but existing the same always.

For where at all have they found in divine Scripture, or from whom have they heard, that there is another Word and another Wisdom besides this Son, that they should frame to themselves such a doctrine? True, indeed, it is written, `Are not My words like fire, and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces[fn-61-P6108_2435555:253-nf] ?' and in the Proverbs, `I will make known My words unto you[fn-61-P6109_2435639:254-nf] ;' but these are precepts and commands, which God has spoken to the saints through His proper and only true Word, concerning which the Psalmist said, `I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I may keep Thy words[fn-61-P6110_2435882:255-nf] .' Such words accordingly the Saviour signifies to be distinct from Himself, when He says in His own person, `The words which I have spoken unto you[fn-61-P6111_2436053:256-nf] .' For certainly such words are not offsprings or sons, nor are there so many words that frame the world, nor so many images of the One God, nor so many who have become men for us, nor as if from many such there were one who has become flesh, as John says; but as being the only Word of God was He preached by John, `The Word was made flesh,' and `all things were made by Him[fn-61-P6112_2436449:257-nf] .' Wherefore of Him alone, our Lord Jesus Christ, and of His oneness with the Father, are written and set forth the testimonies, both of the Father signifying that the Son is One, and of the saints, aware of this and saying that the Word is One, and that He is Only-Begotten. And His works also are set forth; for all things, visible and invisible, have been brought to be through Him, and `without Him was made not one thing[fn-61-P6113_2436905:258-nf] .' But concerning another or any one else they have not a thought, nor frame to themselves words or wisdoms, of which neither name nor deed are signified by Scripture, but are named by these only.

For they too, when they behold the works of God, deny Him the only and true God, and frame to themselves another, whom they can shew neither by work, nor in any testimony drawn from the divine oracles.","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":119,"verse":73,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"87","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"57. For had He been a creature, He had not said, `He begets me,' for the creatures are from without, and are works of the Maker; but the Offspring is not from without nor a work, but from the Father, and proper to His Essence. Wherefore they are creatures; this God's Word and Only-begotten Son. For instance, Moses did not say of the creation, `In the beginning He begat,' nor `In the beginning was,' but `In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth[fn-62-P6254_2496239:372-nf] .' Nor did David say in the Psalm, `Thy hands have \"begotten me,\"' but `made me and fashioned me[fn-62-P6255_2496354:373-nf] ,' everywhere applying the word `made' to the creatures. But to the Son contrariwise; for he has not said `I made,' but `I begat[fn-62-P6256_2496504:374-nf] ,' and `He begets me,' and `My heart uttered a good Word[fn-62-P6257_2496579:375-nf] .' And in the instance of the creation, `In the beginning He made;' but in the instance of the Son, `In the beginning was the Word[fn-62-P6258_2496729:376-nf] .' And there is this difference, that the creatures are made upon the beginning, and have a beginning of existence connected with an interval; wherefore also what is said of them, `In the beginning He made,' is as much as saying of them, `From the beginning He made:'-as the Lord, knowing that which He had made, taught, when He silenced the Pharisees, with the words, `He which made them from the beginning, made them male and female[fn-62-P6259_2497182:377-nf] ;' for from some beginning, when they were not yet, were originate things brought into being and created. This too the Holy Spirit has signified in the Psalms, saying, `Thou, Lord, at the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth[fn-62-P6260_2497439:378-nf] ;' and again, `O think upon Thy congregation which Thou hast purchased from the beginning[fn-62-P6261_2497549:379-nf] ;' now it is plain that what takes place at the beginning, has a beginning of creation, and that from some beginning God purchased His congregation. And that `In the beginning He made,' from his saying `made,' means `began to make,' Moses himself shews by saying, after the completion of all things, `And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because that in it He had rested from all His work which God began to make[fn-62-P6262_2497997:380-nf] .' Therefore the creatures began to be made; but the Word of God, not having beginning of being, certainly did not begin to be, nor begin to come to be, but was ever. And the works have their beginning in their making, and their beginning precedes their coming to be; but the Word, not being of things which come to be, rather comes to be Himself the Framer of those which have a beginning. And the being of things originate is measured by their becoming[fn-62-P6263_2498471:381-nf] , and from some beginning does God begin to make them through the Word, that it may be known that they were not before their origination; but the Word has His being, in no other beginning[fn-62-P6264_2498686:382-nf] than the Father, whom[fn-62-P6265_2498739:383-nf] they allow to be without beginning, so that He too exists without beginning? the Father, being His Offspring, not His creature.

But if He is also called `First-born of the creation[fn-62-P6296_2510263:409-nf] ,' still this is not as if He were levelled to the creatures, and only first of them in point of time (for how should that be, since He is `Only-begotten?'), but it is because of the Word's condescension[fn-62-P6297_2510714:410-nf] to the creatures, according to which He has become the `Brother' of `many.' For the term `Only-begotten' is used where there are no brethren, but `First-born[fn-62-P6298_2511565:411-nf] ' because of brethren. Accordingly it is nowhere written in the Scriptures, `the first-born of God,' nor `the creature of God;' but `Only-begotten' and `Son' and `Word' and `Wisdom,' refer to Him as proper to the Father[fn-62-P6299_2511812:412-nf] . Thus, `We have seen His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father[fn-63-P6300_2512365:413-nf] ;' and `God sent His Only-begotten Son[fn-63-P6301_2512423:414-nf] ;' and `O Lord, Thy Word endureth for ever[fn-63-P6302_2512487:415-nf] ;' and `In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God;' and `Christ the Power of God and the Wisdom of God[fn-63-P6303_2512625:416-nf] ;' and `This is My beloved Son;' and `Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God[fn-63-P6304_2512731:417-nf] .' But `first-born' implied the descent to the creation[fn-63-P6305_2512824:418-nf] ; for of it has He been called first-born; and `He created' implies His grace towards the works, for for them is He created. If then He is Only-begotten, as indeed He is, `First-born' needs some explanation; but if He be really First-born, then He is not Only-begotten[fn-63-P6306_2513246:419-nf] . For the same cannot be both Only-begotten and First-born, except in different relations;-that is, Only-begotten, because of His generation from the Father, as has been said; and First-born, because of His condescension to the creation and His making the many His brethren. Certainly, those two terms being inconsistent with each other, one should say that the attribute of being Only-begotten has justly the preference in the instance of the Word, in that there is no other Word, or other Wisdom, but He alone is very Son of the Father. Moreover[fn-63-P6307_2513947:420-nf] , as was before[fn-63-P6308_2514371:421-nf] said, not in connection with any reason, but absolutely[fn-63-P6309_2514441:422-nf] it is said of Him, `The Only-begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father[fn-63-P6310_2514651:423-nf] ;' but the word `First-born' has again the creation as a reason in connection with it, which Paul proceeds to say, `for in Him all things were created[fn-63-P6311_2514821:424-nf] .'

For if He in whom `all things came to be,' Himself became flesh, but Christ is not in the Father, as Word `by whom all things came to be,' then Christ has not become flesh, but perhaps Christ was named Word.

This is One Son, who is Word, Wisdom, Power; for God is not compounded of these, but is generative[fn-71-P7114_2828604:21-nf] of them. For as He frames the creatures by the Word, so according to the nature of His own Essence has He the Word as an Offspring, through whom He frames and creates and dispenses all things.

If then, because the `womb' is human, therefore it is foreign to God, plainly `heart' too has a human meaning[fn-72-P7247_2877215:123-nf] , for that which has heart has womb also. Since then both are human, we must deny both, or seek to explain both.

What shall we say then, brethren? How spake the Father to the Son, seeing that the Son says, \"As the Father taught me, I speak these things\"? Did He speak to Him? When the Father taught the Son, did He use words, as you do when you teach your son? How could He use words to the Word! What words, many in number, could be used to the one Word? Did the Word of the Father approach His ears to the Father's mouth? Such things are carnal: banish them from your hearts. For this I say, if only you have understood my words, I certainly have spoken and my words have sounded, and by their sound have reached your ears, and through your sense of hearing have carried their meaning to your mind, if so be you have understood. Suppose that some person of Latin[fn-17-P1701_1080737:8-nf] speech has heard, but has only heard without understanding, what I have said. As regards the noise issuing from my mouth, he who has understood not has been a sharer therein just like yourselves. He has heard that sound; the same syllables have smote on his ears, but they have produced no effect on his mind. Why? Because he understood not. But if you have understood, whence comes your understanding? My words have sounded in the ear: have I kindled any light in the heart? Without doubt, if what I have said is true, and this truth you have not only heard, but also understood, two things have there been wrought (distinguish between them), hearing and intelligence. Hearing has been wrought by me, but by whom has understanding? I have spoken to the ear, that you might hear; who has spoken to your heart for understanding? Doubtless some one has also said something to your heart, that not only the noise of words might strike your ear, but something also of the truth might descend into your heart. Some one has spoken also to your heart, but you do not see him. If, brethren, you have understood, your heart also has been spoken to. Intelligence is the gift of God. And who, if you have understood, has spoken so in your heart, but He to whom the Psalm says, \"Give me understanding, that I may learn Thy commandments?\"[fn-17-P1702_1082215:9-nf] For example, the bishop has spoken. What has he said, some one asks. You repeat what he has spoken, and add, He has said the truth. Then another, who has not understood, says, What has he said, or what is it you are praising? Both have heard me; I have spoken to both; but to one of them God has spoken. If we may compare small things with great (for what are we to Him?), something, I know not what, of an incorporeal and spiritual kind God works in us, which is neither sound to strike the ear, nor color to be discerned by the eyes, nor smell to enter the nostrils, nor taste to be judged of by the mouth, nor anything hard or soft to be sensible to the touch; yet something there is which it is easy to feel,-impossible to explain. If then God, as I was saying, speaks in our hearts without sound, how speaks He to His Son? Thus then, brethren, think thus as much as you can, if, as I have said, we may in some measure compare small things with great: think thus. In an incorporeal way the Father spoke to the Son, because in an incorporeal way the Father begot the Son. Nor did He so teach Him as if He had begotten Him untaught; but to have taught Him is the same as to have begotten Him full of knowledge; and this, \"The Father hath taught me,\" is the same as, The Father hath begotten me already knowing. For if, as few understand, the nature of the Truth is simple, to be is to the Son the same as to know. From Him therefore He has knowledge, from whom He has being.[fn-17-P1703_1083709:10-nf] Not that from Him He had first being, and afterwards knowledge; but as in begetting He gave Him to be, so in begetting He gave Him to know; for, as was said, to the simple nature of the Truth, being is not one thing and knowing another, but one and the same.","title":"Tractate XL.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":119,"verse":164,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_81_sermon_lxiv_cxiv_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"1.

He then the Lord our God, who abiding with the Father made us, and having been made for us, re-made us, He the Lord our God Jesus Christ Himself says to us what we have heard just now in the Gospel. \"If,\" He saith, \"thy brother shall sin against thee, rebuke him, and if he shall repent, forgive him; and if he shall sin against time seven times in a day, and shall come and say, I repent, forgive him.\"[fn-56-P5659_2394387:1-nf] He would not have \"seven times in a day\" otherwise understood than \"as often as may be,\" lest haply he sin eight times, and thou be unwilling to forgive.

Herod was none the better for fulfilling his oath, when, of course only to save himself from perjury, he became the prophet's murderer.[fn-49-P4908_1529098:17-nf] Swearing is absolutely forbidden,[fn-49-P4909_1529152:18-nf] and it is only reasonable that the oath which tends to evil should be condemned. The swearer must therefore change his mind, and not persist in confirming his impiety. Consider the absurdity of the thing a little further. Suppose a man to swear that he will put his brother's eyes out: is it well for him to carry his oath into action? Or to commit murder? or to break any other commandment? \"I have sworn, and I will perform it,\"[fn-49-P4910_1529602:19-nf] not to sin, but to \"keep thy righteous judgments.\" It is no less our duty to undo and destroy sin, than it is to confirm the commandment by immutable counsels.","title":"Letter CXCIX","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":119,"verse":165,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_98_tractate_xciii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"1. In the words preceding this chapter of the Gospel, the Lord strengthened His disciples to endure the hatred of their enemies, and prepared them also by His own example to become the more courageous in imitating Him: adding the promise, that the Holy Spirit should. come to bear witness of Him, and also that they themselves could become His witnesses, through the effectual working of His Spirit in their hearts. For such is His meaning when He saith, \"He shall bear witness of me, and ye also shall bear witness.\" That is to say, because He shall bear witness, ye also shall bear witness: He in your hearts, you in your voices; He by inspiration, you by utterance: that the words might be fulfilled, \"Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth.\"[fn-31-P3111_1746482:1-nf] For it would have been to little purpose to have exhorted them by His example, had He not also filled them with His Spirit. Just as we see that the Apostle Peter, after having heard His words, when He said, \"The servant is not greater than his lord: if they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you;\"[fn-31-P3112_1746806:2-nf] and seen that already fulfilled in Him, wherein, had example been sufficient, he ought to have imitated the patient endurance of his Lord, yet succumbed and fell into denial, as utterly unable to bear what He saw his Master enduring. But when he really received the gift of the Holy Spirit, he preached Him whom he had denied; and whom he had been afraid to confess, he had no fear now in openly proclaiming. Already, indeed, had he been sufficiently taught by example to know what was proper to be done; but not yet was he inspired with the power to do what he knew: he had got instruction to stand, but not the strength to keep him from falling. But after this was supplied by the Holy Spirit, he preached Christ even to the death, whom, in his fear of death, he had previously denied. And so the Lord in this succeeding chapter, on which we have now to address you, saith, \"These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.\" As it is sung in the psalm, \"Great peace have they who love Thy law, and nothing shall offend them.\"[fn-31-P3113_1747871:3-nf] Properly enough, therefore, with the promise of the Holy Spirit, by whose operation in their hearts they should be made His witnesses, He added, \"These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.\" For when the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit given unto us,[fn-31-P3114_1748193:4-nf] they have great peace who love God's law, so that nothing may offend them.","title":"Tractate XCIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":119,"verse":165,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_220_sermon_xcv_a_homily_on_the_beatitudes_st_matt_v_1_9_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"28","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"\"Blessed are the peace-makers, for they shall be called the sons of God[fn-42-P4255_1090969:32-nf] .\" This blessedness, beloved, belongs not to any and every kind of agreement and harmony, but to that of which the Apostle speaks: \"have peace towards God[fn-42-P4256_1091144:33-nf] ;\" and of which the Prophet David speaks: \"Much peace have they that love Thy law, and they have no cause of offences[fn-42-P4257_1091332:34-nf] .\" This peace even the closest ties of friendship and the exactest likeness of mind do not really gain, if they do not agree with God's will.

The Christian ought not to grudge another's reputation, nor rejoice over any man's faults;[fn-29-P2937_964754:42-nf] he ought in Christ's love to grieve and be afflicted at his brother's faults, and rejoice over his brother's good deeds.[fn-29-P2938_964896:43-nf] He ought not to be indifferent or silent before sinners.[fn-29-P2939_964974:44-nf] He who shows another to be wrong ought to do so with all tenderness,[fn-29-P2940_965062:45-nf] in the fear of God, and with the object of converting the sinner.[fn-29-P2941_965146:46-nf] He who is proved wrong or rebuked ought to take it willingly, recognizing his own gain in being set right. When any one is being accused, it is not right for another, before him or any one else, to contradict the accuser; but if at any time the charge seems groundless to any one, he ought privately to enter into discussion with the accuser, and either produce, or acquire, conviction.

No one ought to cherish a grudge against the sinner who repents, but heartily to forgive him.[fn-29-P2942_965744:47-nf] He who says that he has repented of a sin ought not only to be pricked with compunction for his sin, but also to bring forth fruits worthy of repentance.[fn-29-P2943_965917:48-nf] He who has been corrected in first faults, and received pardon, if he sins again prepares for himself a judgment of wrath worse than the former.[fn-29-P2944_966079:49-nf] He, who after the first and second admonition[fn-29-P2945_966146:50-nf] abides in his fault, ought to be brought before the person in authority,[fn-29-P2946_966238:51-nf] if haply after being rebuked by more he may be ashamed.[fn-29-P2947_966420:52-nf] If even thus he fail to be set right he is to be cut off from the rest as one that maketh to offend, and regarded as a heathen and a publican,[fn-29-P2948_966584:53-nf] for the security of them that are obedient, according to the saving, When the impious fall the righteous tremble.[fn-29-P2949_966720:54-nf] He should be grieved over as a limb cut from the body.

Now the proper way to direct our investigation seems to me to be as follows. We say that every good thing, which by God's providence befalls us, is an operation, of the Grace which worketh in us all things, as the apostle says, \"But all these worketh that one and the self same Spirit dividing to every man severally as he will.\"[fn-31-P3112_1012024:7-nf] If we ask, if the supply of good things which thus comes to the saints has its origin in the Holy Ghost alone, we are on the other hand guided by Scripture to the belief that of the supply of the good things which are wrought in us through the Holy Ghost, the Originator and Cause is the Only-begotten God;[fn-31-P3113_1012350:8-nf] for we are taught by Holy Scripture that \"All things were made by Him,\"[fn-31-P3114_1012794:9-nf] and \"by Him consist.\"[fn-31-P3115_1012831:10-nf] When we are exalted to this conception, again, led by God-inspired guidance, we are taught that by that power all things are brought from non-being into being, but yet not by that power to the exclusion of origination.[fn-31-P3116_1013067:11-nf] On the other hand there is a certain power subsisting without generation and without origination,[fn-31-P3117_1013181:12-nf] which is the cause of the cause of all things. For the Son, by whom are all things, and with whom the Holy Ghost is inseparably conceived of, is of the Father.[fn-31-P3118_1013385:13-nf] For it is not possible for any one to conceive of the Son if he be not previously enlightened by the Spirit. Since, then, the Holy Ghost, from Whom all the supply of good things for creation has its source, is attached to the Son, and with Him is inseparably apprehended, and has Its[fn-31-P3119_1013865:14-nf] being attached to the Father, as cause, from Whom also It proceeds; It has this note of Its peculiar hypostatic nature, that It is known after the Son[fn-31-P3120_1014044:15-nf] and together with the Son, and that It has Its subsistence of the Father. The Son, Who declares the Spirit proceeding from the Father through Himself and with Himself, shining forth alone and by only-begetting from the unbegotten light, so far as the peculiar notes are concerned, has nothing in common either with the Father or with the Holy Ghost. He alone is known by the stated signs. But God, Who is over all, alone haS, as one special mark of His own hypostasis, His being Father, and His deriving His hypostasis[fn-31-P3121_1015000:16-nf] from no cause; and through this mark He is peculiarly known. Wherefore in the communion of the substance we maintain that there is no mutual approach or intercommunion of those notes of indication perceived in the Trinity, whereby is set forth the proper peculiarity of the Persons delivered in the faith, each of these being distinctively apprehended by His own notes. Hence, in accordance with the stated signs of indication, discovery is made of the separation of the hypostases; while so far as relates to the infinite, the incomprehensible, the uncreate, the uncircumscribed, and similar attributes, there is no variableness in the life-giving nature; in that, I mean, of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but in Them is seen a certain communion indissoluble and continuous. And by the same considerations, whereby a reflective student could perceive the greatness of any one of the (Persons) believed in in the Holy Trinity, he will proceed without variation. Beholding the glory in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, his mind all the while recognises no void interval wherein it may travel between Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, for there is nothing inserted between Them; nor beyond the divine nature is there anything so subsisting as to be able to divide that nature from itself by the interposition of any foreign matter. Neither is there any vacuum of interval, void of subsistence, which can make a break in the mutual harmony of the divine essence, and solve the continuity by the interjection of emptiness. He who perceives the Father, and perceives Him by Himself, has at the same time mental perception of the Son; and he who receives the Son does not divide Him from the Spirit, but, in consecution so far as order is concerned, in conjunction so far as nature is concerned, expresses the faith commingled in himself in the three together. He who makes mention of the Spirit alone, embraces also in this confession Him of whom He is the Spirit. And since the Spirit is Christ's and of God,[fn-31-P3122_1017013:17-nf] as says Paul, then just as he who lays hold on one end of the chain pulls the other to him, so he who \"draws the Spirit,\"[fn-31-P3123_1017169:18-nf] as says the prophet, by His means draws to him at the same time both the Son and the Father. And if any one verily receives the Son, he will hold Him on both sides, the Son drawing towards him on the one His own Father, and on the other His own Spirit. For He who eternally exists in the Father can never be cut off from the Father, nor can He who worketh all things by the Spirit ever be disjoined from His own Spirit. Likewise moreover he who receives the Father virtually receives at the same time both the Son and the Spirit; for it is in no wise possible to entertain the idea of severance or division, in such a way as that the Son should be thought of apart from the Father, or the Spirit be disjoined from the Son. But the communion and the distinction apprehended in Them are, in a certain sense, ineffable and inconceivable, the continuity of nature being never rent asunder by the distinction of the hypostases, nor the notes of proper distinction confounded in the community of essence. Marvel not then at my speaking of the name thing as being both conjoined and parted, and thinking as it were darkly in a riddle, of a certain[fn-31-P3124_1018478:19-nf] new and strange conjoined separation and separated conjunction. Indeed, even in objects perceptible to the senses, any one who approaches the subject in a candid and uncontentious spirit, may find similar conditions of things.","title":"Letter XXXVIII","author":"St. Basil"}]
