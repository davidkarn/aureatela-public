Wherefore let us hold this above all, that whatsoever is said of that most eminent and divine loftiness in respect to itself, is said in respect to substance, but that which is said in relation to anything, is not said in respect to substance, but relatively; and that the effect of the same substance in Father and Son and Holy Spirit is, that whatsoever is said of each in respect to themselves, is to be taken of them, not in the plural in sum, but in the singular. For as the Father is God, and the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God, which no one doubts to be said in respect to substance, yet we do not say that the very Supreme Trinity itself is three Gods, but one God. So the Father is great, the Son great, and the Holy Spirit great; yet not three greats, but one great. For it is not written of the Father alone, as they perversely suppose, but of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, \"Thou art great: Thou art God alone.\"[fn-10-P1046_421368:10-nf] And the Father is good, the Son good, and the Holy Spirit good; yet not three goods, but one good, of whom it is said, \"None is good, save one, that is, God.\" For the Lord Jesus, lest He should be understood as man only by him who said, \"Good Master,\" as addressing a man, does not therefore say, There is none good, save the Father alone; but, \"None is good, save one, that is, God.\"[fn-10-P1047_421774:11-nf] For the Father by Himself is declared by the name of Father; but by the name of God, both Himself and the Son and the Holy Spirit., because the Trinity is one God. But position, and condition, and places, and times, are not said to be in God properly, but metaphorically and through similitudes. For He is both said to dwell between the cherubims,[fn-10-P1048_422148:12-nf] which is spoken in respect to position; and to be covered with the deep as with a garment,[fn-10-P1049_422258:13-nf] which is said in respect to condition; and \"Thy years shall have no end,\"[fn-10-P1050_422349:14-nf] which is said in respect of time; and, \"If I ascend up into heaven, Thou art there,\"[fn-10-P1051_422452:15-nf] which is said in respect to place. And as respects action (or making), perhaps it may be said most truly of God alone, for God alone makes and Himself is not made. Nor is He liable to passions as far as belongs to that substance whereby He is God. So the Father is omnipotent, the Son omnipotent, and the Holy Spirit is omnipotent; yet not three omnipotents, but one omnipotent:[fn-10-P1052_422851:16-nf] \"For of Him are all things, and through Him are all things, and in Him are all things; to whom be glory.\"[fn-10-P1053_423168:17-nf] Whatever, therefore, is spoken of God in respect to Himself, is both spoken singly of each person, that is, of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit; and together of the Trinity itself, not plurally but in the singular. For inasmuch as to God it is not one thing to be, and another thing to be great, but to Him it is the same thing to be, as it is to be great; therefore, as we do not say three essences, so we do not say three greatnesses, but one essence and one greatness. I say essence, which in Greek is called ousia, and which we call more usually substance.","title":"Book V.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":86,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_101_tractate_xcvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"4. Wherefore, beloved, you need not expect to hear from us what the Lord then refrained from telling His disciples, because they were still unable to bear them: but rather seek to grow in the love that is shed abroad in your hearts by the Holy Spirit who is given unto you;[fn-31-P3196_1787923:4-nf] that, fervent in spirit, and loving spiritual things, you may be able, not by any sign apparent to your bodily eyes, or any sound striking on your bodily ears, but by the inward eyesight and hearing, to become acquainted with that spiritual light and that spiritual word which carnal men are unable to bear. For that cannot be loved which is altogether unknown. But when what is known, in however small a measure, is also loved, by the self-same love one is led on to a better and fuller knowledge. If, then, you grow in the love which the Holy Spirit spreads abroad in your hearts, \"He will teach you all truth;\" or, as other codices have it, \"He will guide you in all truth:\"[fn-31-P3197_1788615:5-nf] as it is said, \"Lead me in Thy way, O Lord, and I will walk in Thy truth.\"[fn-31-P3198_1788767:6-nf] So shall the result be, that not from outward teachers will you learn those things which the Lord at that time declined to utter, but be all taught of God;[fn-31-P3199_1788942:7-nf] so that the very things which you have learned and believed by means of lessons and sermons supplied from without regarding the nature of God, as incorporeal, and unconfined by limits, and yet not rolled out as a mass of matter through infinite space, but everywhere whole and perfect and infinite, without the gleaming of colors, without the tracing of bodily outlines, without any markings of letters or succession of syllables,-your minds themselves may have the power to perceive. Well, now, I have just said something which is perhaps of that same character, and yet you have received it; and you have not only been able to bear it, but have also listened to it with pleasure. But were that inward Teacher, who, while still speaking in an external way to the disciples, said, \"I have still many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now,\" wishing to speak inwardly to us of what I have said of the incorporeal nature of God in the same way as He speaks to the angels, who always behold the face of the Father[fn-32-P3200_1789983:8-nf] we should still be unable to bear them. Accordingly, when He says, \"He will teach you all truth,\" or \"will guide yon into all truth,\" I do not think the fulfillment is possible in any one's mind in this present life(for who is there, while living in this corruptible and soul-oppressing body,[fn-32-P3201_1790296:9-nf] that can know all truth, when even the apostle says, \"We know in part \"?), but because it is effected by the Holy Spirit, of whom we have now received the earnest,[fn-32-P3202_1790478:10-nf] that we shall attain also to the actual fullness of knowledge: whereof iris said by the same apostle, \"But then face to face;\" and, \"Now I know in part, but then shall I know even as also I am known;\"[fn-32-P3203_1790698:11-nf] not as a thing which he knows fully in this life, but which, as a thing that would still be future on to the attainment of that perfection, the Lord promised us through the love of the Spirit, when He said, \"He will teach you all truth,\"' or \"will guide you unto all truth.\"","title":"Tractate XCVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":86,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_16_on_nature_and_grace_against_pelagius","source_chapter":38,"source_paragraph":"160","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"So will He bestow on us whatever pleases Him, that if there be anything displeasing to Him in us, it will also be displeasing to us. \"He will,\" as the Scripture has said, \"turn aside our paths from His own way,\"[fn-20-P2093_878503:95-nf] and will make that which is His own to be our way; because it is by Himself that the favour is bestowed on such as believe in Him and hope in Him that we will do it. For there is a way of righteousness of which they are ignorant \"who have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge,\"[fn-20-P2094_878814:96-nf] and who, wishing to frame a righteousness of their own, \"have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.\"[fn-20-P2095_878947:97-nf] \"For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth;\"[fn-20-P2096_879045:98-nf] and He has said, \"I am the way.\"[fn-20-P2097_879094:99-nf] Yet God's voice has alarmed those who have already begun to walk in this way, lest they should be lifted up, as if it were by their own energies that they were walking therein. For the same persons to whom the apostle, on account of this danger, says, \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do of His good pleasure,\"[fn-20-P2098_879500:100-nf] are likewise for the self-same reason admonished in the psalm: \"Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice in Him with trembling. Accept correction, lest at any time the Lord be angry, and ye perish from the righteous way, when His wrath shall be suddenly kindled upon you.\"[fn-20-P2099_879791:101-nf] He does not say, \"Lest at any time the Lord be angry and refuse to show you the righteous way,\" or, \"refuse to lead you into the way of righteousness;\" but even after you are walking therein, he was able so to terrify as to say, \"Lest ye perish from the righteous way.\" Now, whence could this arise if not from pride, which (as I have so often said, and must repeat again and again) has to be guarded against even in things which are rightly done, that is, in the very way of righteousness, lest a man, by regarding as his own that which is really God's, lose what is God's and be reduced merely to what is his own? Let us then carry out the concluding injunction of this same psalm, \"Blessed are all they that trust in Him,\"[fn-21-P2100_880541:102-nf] so that He may Himself indeed effect and Himself show His own way in us, to whom it is said, \"Show us Thy mercy, O Lord;\"[fn-21-P2101_880682:103-nf] and Himself bestow on us the pathway of safety that we may walk therein, to whom the prayer is offered, \"And grant us Thy salvation;\"[fn-21-P2102_880837:104-nf] and Himself lead us in the self-same way, to whom again it is said, \"Guide me, O Lord, in Thy way, and in Thy truth will I walk;\"[fn-21-P2103_880988:105-nf] Himself, too, conduct us to those promises whither His way leads, to whom it is said, \"Even there shall Thy hand lead me and Thy right hand shall hold me;\"[fn-21-P2104_881167:106-nf] Himself pasture therein those who sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, of whom it is said, \"He shall make them sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.\"[fn-21-P2105_881360:107-nf] Now we do not, when we make mention of these things, take away freedom of will, but we preach the grace of God. For to whom are those gracious gifts of use, but to the man who uses, but humbly uses, his own will, and makes no boast of the power and energy thereof, as if it alone were sufficient for perfecting him in righteousness?","title":"On Nature and Grace, Against Pelagius","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":86,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_01_npnf1_01_19_book_xi_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"40","folder":"NPNF1-01","text":"3.

These are the opinions that he puts forth respecting God, as though He mocked His creatures with names untrue to their meaning, bestowing on the weakest the most honourable appellations, and pouring contempt on the honourable by making them synonymous with the base. Now a virtuous man, if carried, even involuntarily, beyond the limits of truth, is overwhelmed with shame. Yet Eunomius thinks it no shame to God that He should seem to give a false colour to things by their appellations. Not such is the testimony of the Scriptures to the Divine nature. \"God is long-suffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth,\" says David[fn-23-P2304_1500419:83-nf] .

This is the end of their boasted dialectic cleverness, to display God Himself delighting in deceit, and not superior to the passion of jealousy. For surely it is no better than deceit not to name weak things, as they are in their true nature and worth, but to invest them with empty names, derived from superior things, not proportioning their value to their name; and it is no better than jealousy if, having it in His power to bestow the more honourable appellation on things to be named for some superiority, He grudged them the honour itself, as deeming the happiness of the weak a loss to Himself personally.

To none other than Him is it suitable, who is also \"the Father of mercies,\"[fn-76-P7669_2195768:492-nf] and (in the prophets) has been described as \"full of compassion, and gracious, and plenteous in mercy.\"[fn-76-P7670_2195892:493-nf] In Jonah you find the signal act of His mercy, which He showed to the praying Ninevites.[fn-76-P7671_2196035:494-nf] How inflexible was He at the tears of Hezekiah![fn-76-P7672_2196104:495-nf] How ready to forgive Ahab, the husband of Jezebel, the blood of Naboth, when he deprecated His anger.[fn-76-P7673_2196231:496-nf] How prompt in pardoning David on his confession of his sin[fn-76-P7674_2196318:497-nf] -preferring, indeed, the sinner's repentance to his death, of course because of His gracious attribute of mercy.[fn-76-P7675_2196454:498-nf] Now, if Marcion's god has exhibited or proclaimed any such thing as this, I will allow him to be \"the Father of mercies.\" Since, however, he ascribes to him this title only from the time he has been revealed, as if he were the father of mercies from the time only when he began to liberate the human race, then we on our side, too,[fn-76-P7676_2196811:499-nf] adopt the same precise date of his alleged revelation; but it is that we may deny him! It is then not competent to him to ascribe any quality to his god, whom indeed he only promulged by the fact of such an ascription; for only if it were previously evident that his god had an existence, could he be permitted to ascribe an attribute to him. The ascribed attribute is only an accident; but accidents[fn-76-P7677_2197234:500-nf] are preceded by the statement of the thing itself of which they are predicated, especially when another claims the attribute which is ascribed to him who has not been previously shown to exist. Our denial of his existence will be all the more peremptory, because of the fact that the attribute which is alleged in proof of it belongs to that God who has been already revealed. Therefore \"the New Testament\" will appertain to none other than Him who promised it-if not \"its letter, yet its spirit; \"[fn-76-P7678_2197775:501-nf] and herein will lie its newness. Indeed, He who had engraved its letter in stones is the same as He who had said of its spirit, \"I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh.\"[fn-76-P7679_2197972:502-nf] Even if \"the letter killeth, yet the Spirit giveth life; \"[fn-76-P7680_2198051:503-nf] and both belong to Him who says: \"I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal.\"[fn-76-P7681_2198156:504-nf] We have already made good the Creator's claim to this twofold character of judgment and goodness[fn-76-P7682_2198277:505-nf] -\"killing in the letter\" through the law, and \"quickening in the Spirit\" through the Gospel. Now these attributes, however different they be, cannot possibly make two gods; for they have already (in the prevenient dispensation of the Old Testament) been found to meet in One.[fn-76-P7683_2198601:506-nf] He alludes to Moses' veil, covered with which \"his face could not be stedfastly seen by the children of Israel.\"[fn-76-P7684_2198755:507-nf] Since he did this to maintain the superiority of the glory of the New Testament, which is permanent in its glory, over that of the Old, \"which was to be done away,\"[fn-76-P7685_2198946:508-nf] this fact gives support to my belief which exalts the Gospel above the law and you must look well to it that it does not even more than this. For only there is superiority possible where was previously the thing over which superiority can be affirmed. But then he says, \"But their minds were blinded\"[fn-76-P7686_2199272:509-nf] -of the world; certainly not the Creator's mind, but the minds of the people which are in the world.[fn-76-P7687_2199416:510-nf] Of Israel he says, Even unto this day the same veil is upon their heart; \"[fn-76-P7688_2199659:511-nf] showing that the veil which was on the face of Moses was a figure of the veil which is on the heart of the nation still; because even now Moses is not seen by them in heart, just as he was not then seen by them in eye. But what concern has Paul with the veil which still obscures Moses from their view, if the Christ of the Creator, whom Moses predicted, is not yet come? How are the hearts of the Jews represented as still covered and veiled, if the predictions of Moses relating to Christ, in whom it was their duty to believe through him, are as yet unfulfilled? What had the apostle of a strange Christ to complain of, if the Jews failed in understanding the mysterious announcements of their own God, unless the veil which was upon their hearts had reference to that blindness which concealed from their eyes the Christ of Moses? Then, again, the words which follow, But when it shall turn to the Lord, the evil shall be taken away,\"[fn-76-P7689_2200621:512-nf] properly refer to the Jew, over whose gaze Moses' veil is spread, to the effect that, when he is turned to the faith of Christ, he will understand how Moses spoke of Christ. But how shall the veil of the Creator be taken away by the Christ of another god, whose mysteries the Creator could not possibly have veiled-unknown mysteries, as they were of an unknown god? So he says that \"we now with open face\" (meaning the candour of the heart, which in the Jews had been covered with a veil), \"beholding Christ, are changed into the same image, from that glory\" (wherewith Moses was transfigured as by the glory of the Lord) \"to another glory.\"[fn-76-P7690_2201286:513-nf] By thus setting forth the glory which illumined the person of Moses from his interview with God, and the veil which concealed the same from the infirmity of the people, and by superinducing thereupon the revelation and the glory of the Spirit in the person of Christ-\"even as,\" to use his words, \"by the Spirit of the Lord\"[fn-76-P7691_2201633:514-nf] -he testifies that the whole Mosaic system[fn-76-P7692_2201897:515-nf] was a figure of Christ, of whom the Jews indeed were ignorant, but who is known to us Christians. We are quite aware that some passages are open to ambiguity, from the way in which they are read, or else from their punctuation, when there is room for these two causes of ambiguity. The latter method has been adopted by Marcion, by reading the passage which follows, \"in whom the God of this world,\"[fn-76-P7693_2202325:516-nf] as if it described the Creator as the God of this world, in order that he may, by these words, imply that there is another God for the other world. We, however, say that the passage ought to be punctuated with a comma after God, to this effect: \"In whom God hath blinded the eyes of the unbelievers of this world.\"[fn-76-P7694_2202661:517-nf] \"In whom\" means the Jewish unbelievers, from some of whom the gospel is still hidden under Moses' veil. Now it is these whom God had threatened for \"loving Him indeed with the lip, whilst their heart was far from Him,\"[fn-76-P7695_2203650:518-nf] in these angry words: \"Ye shall hear with your ears, and not understand; and see with your eyes, but not perceive; \"[fn-76-P7696_2203789:519-nf] and, \"If ye will not believe, ye shall not understand; \"[fn-76-P7697_2203881:520-nf] and again, \"I will take away the wisdom of their wise men, and bring to nought[fn-76-P7698_2203987:521-nf] the understanding of their prudent ones.\" But these words, of course, He did not pronounce against them for concealing the gospel of the unknown God. At any rate, if there is a God of this world,[fn-76-P7699_2204217:522-nf] He blinds the heart of the unbelievers of this world, because they have not of their own accord recognised His Christ, who ought to be understood from His Scriptures.[fn-77-P7700_2204457:523-nf] Content with my advantage, I can willingly refrain from noticing to any greater length[fn-77-P7701_2204617:524-nf] this point of ambiguous punctuation, so as not to give my adversary any advantage,[fn-77-P7702_2204753:525-nf] indeed, I might have wholly omitted the discussion. A simpler answer I shall find ready to hand in interpreting \"the god of this world\" of the devil, who once said, as the prophet describes him: \"I will be like the Most High; I will exalt my throne in the clouds.\"[fn-77-P7703_2205190:526-nf] The whole superstition, indeed, of this world has got into his hands,[fn-77-P7704_2205281:527-nf] so that he blinds effectually the hearts of unbelievers, and of none more than the apostate Marcion's. Now he did not observe how much this clause of the sentence made against him: \"For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to (give) the light of the knowledge (of His glory) in the face of (Jesus) Christ.\"[fn-77-P7705_2205660:528-nf] Now who was it that said; \"Let there be light? \"[fn-77-P7706_2205730:529-nf] And who was it that said to Christ concerning giving light to the world: \"I have set Thee as a light to the Gentiles\"[fn-77-P7707_2205866:530-nf] -to them, that is, \"who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death? \"[fn-77-P7708_2205989:531-nf] (None else, surely, than He), to whom the Spirit in the Psalm answers, in His foresight of the future, saying, \"The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, hath been displayed upon us.\"[fn-77-P7709_2206205:532-nf] Now the countenance (or person[fn-77-P7710_2206262:533-nf] ) of the Lord here is Christ. Wherefore the apostle said above: Christ, who is the image of God.\"[fn-77-P7711_2206409:534-nf] Since Christ, then, is the person of the Creator, who said, \"Let there be light,\" it follows that Christ and the apostles, and the gospel, and the veil, and Moses-nay, the whole of the dispensations-belong to the God who is the Creator of this world, according to the testimony of the clause (above adverted to), and certainly not to him who never said, \"Let there be light.\" I here pass over discussion about another epistle, which we hold to have been written to the Ephesians, but the heretics to the Laodiceans. In it he tells[fn-77-P7712_2206961:535-nf] them to remember, that at the time when they were Gentiles they were without Christ, aliens from (the commonwealth of) Israel, without intercourse, without the covenants and any hope of promise, nay, without God, even in his own world,[fn-77-P7713_2207209:536-nf] as the Creator thereof. Since therefore he said, that the Gentiles were without God, whilst their god was the devil, not the Creator, it is clear that he must be understood to be the lord of this world, whom the Gentiles received as their god-not the Creator, of whom they were in ignorance. But how does it happen, that \"the treasure which we have in these earthen vessels of ours\"[fn-77-P7714_2207612:537-nf] should not be regarded as belonging to the God who owns the vessels? Now since God's glory is, that so great a treasure is contained in earthen vessels, and since these earthen vessels are of the Creator's make, it follows that the glory is the Creator's; nay, since these vessels of His smack so much of the excellency of the power of God, that power itself must be His also! Indeed, all these things have been consigned to the said \"earthen vessels\" for the very purpose that His excellence might be manifested forth. Henceforth, then, the rival god will have no claim to the glory, and consequently none to the power. Rather, dishonour and weakness will accrue to him, because the earthen vessels with which he had nothing to do have received all the excellency! Well, then, if it be in these very earthen vessels that he tells us we have to endure so great sufferings,[fn-77-P7715_2208506:538-nf] in which we bear about with us the very dying of God,[fn-77-P7716_2208584:539-nf] (Marcion's) god is really ungrateful and unjust, if he does not mean to restore this same I substance of ours at the resurrection, wherein so much has been endured in loyalty to him, in which Christ's very death is borne about, wherein too the excellency of his power is treasured.[fn-77-P7717_2209030:540-nf] For he gives prominence to the statement, \"That the life also of Christ may be manifested in our body,\"[fn-77-P7718_2209156:541-nf] as a contrast to the preceding, that His death is borne about in our body. Now of what life of Christ does he here speak? Of that which we are now living? Then how is it, that in the words which follow he exhorts us not to the things which are seen and are temporal, but to those which are not seen and are eternal[fn-77-P7719_2209494:542-nf] -in other words, not to the present, but to the future? But if it be of the future life of Christ that he speaks, intimating that it is to be made manifest in our body,[fn-77-P7720_2209688:543-nf] then he has clearly predicted the resurrection of the flesh.[fn-77-P7721_2209771:544-nf] He says, too, that \"our outward man perishes,\"[fn-77-P7722_2209840:545-nf] not meaning by an eternal perdition after death, but by labours and sufferings, in reference to which he previously said, \"For which cause we will not faint.\"[fn-77-P7723_2210021:546-nf] Now, when he adds of \"the inward man\" also, that it \"is renewed day by day,\" he demonstrates both issues here-the wasting away of the body by the wear and tear[fn-77-P7724_2210203:547-nf] of its trials, and the renewal of the soul[fn-77-P7725_2210264:548-nf] by its contemplation of the promises.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":86,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"ANF-03","text":"If, owing to the fault of human error, the word God has become a common name (since in the world there are said and believed to be \"gods many\"[fn-76-P7665_2195216:488-nf] ), yet \"the blessed God,\" (who is \"the Father) of our Lord Jesus Christ,\"[fn-76-P7666_2195313:489-nf] will be understood to be no other God than the Creator, who both blessed all things (that He had made), as you find in Genesis,[fn-76-P7667_2195461:490-nf] and is Himself \"blessed by all things,\" as Daniel tells us.[fn-76-P7668_2195540:491-nf] Now, if the title of Father may be claimed for (Marcion's) sterile god, how much more for the Creator?

Since therefore he said, that the Gentiles were without God, whilst their god was the devil, not the Creator, it is clear that he must be understood to be the lord of this world, whom the Gentiles received as their god-not the Creator, of whom they were in ignorance. But how does it happen, that \"the treasure which we have in these earthen vessels of ours\"[fn-77-P7714_2207612:537-nf] should not be regarded as belonging to the God who owns the vessels? Now since God's glory is, that so great a treasure is contained in earthen vessels, and since these earthen vessels are of the Creator's make, it follows that the glory is the Creator's; nay, since these vessels of His smack so much of the excellency of the power of God, that power itself must be His also! Indeed, all these things have been consigned to the said \"earthen vessels\" for the very purpose that His excellence might be manifested forth. Henceforth, then, the rival god will have no claim to the glory, and consequently none to the power. Rather, dishonour and weakness will accrue to him, because the earthen vessels with which he had nothing to do have received all the excellency! Well, then, if it be in these very earthen vessels that he tells us we have to endure so great sufferings,[fn-77-P7715_2208506:538-nf] in which we bear about with us the very dying of God,[fn-77-P7716_2208584:539-nf] (Marcion's) god is really ungrateful and unjust, if he does not mean to restore this same I substance of ours at the resurrection, wherein so much has been endured in loyalty to him, in which Christ's very death is borne about, wherein too the excellency of his power is treasured.[fn-77-P7717_2209030:540-nf] For he gives prominence to the statement, \"That the life also of Christ may be manifested in our body,\"[fn-77-P7718_2209156:541-nf] as a contrast to the preceding, that His death is borne about in our body. Now of what life of Christ does he here speak? Of that which we are now living? Then how is it, that in the words which follow he exhorts us not to the things which are seen and are temporal, but to those which are not seen and are eternal[fn-77-P7719_2209494:542-nf] -in other words, not to the present, but to the future? But if it be of the future life of Christ that he speaks, intimating that it is to be made manifest in our body,[fn-77-P7720_2209688:543-nf] then he has clearly predicted the resurrection of the flesh.[fn-77-P7721_2209771:544-nf] He says, too, that \"our outward man perishes,\"[fn-77-P7722_2209840:545-nf] not meaning by an eternal perdition after death, but by labours and sufferings, in reference to which he previously said, \"For which cause we will not faint.\"[fn-77-P7723_2210021:546-nf] Now, when he adds of \"the inward man\" also, that it \"is renewed day by day,\" he demonstrates both issues here-the wasting away of the body by the wear and tear[fn-77-P7724_2210203:547-nf] of its trials, and the renewal of the soul[fn-77-P7725_2210264:548-nf] by its contemplation of the promises.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":86,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_27_book_v_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"149","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"110.

Since, again, some who are reckoned among the orthodox go beyond the pre-arranged plan for the exaltation of the just, and are ignorant of the methods by which they are disciplined beforehand for incorruption, they thus entertain heretical opinions. For the heretics, despising the handiwork of God, and not admitting the salvation of their flesh, while they also treat the promise of God contemptuously, and pass beyond God altogether in the sentiments they form, affirm that immediately upon their death they shall pass above the heavens and the Demiurge, and go to the Mother (Achamoth) or to that Father whom they have feigned. Those persons, therefore, who disallow a resurrection affecting the whole man (universam reprobant resurrectionem), and as far as in them lies remove it from the midst [of the Christian scheme], how can they be wondered at, if again they know nothing as to the plan of the resurrection? For they do not choose to understand, that if these things are as they say, the Lord Himself, in whom they profess to believe, did not rise again upon the third day; but immediately upon His expiring on the cross, undoubtedly departed on high, leaving His body to the earth. But the case was, that for three days He dwelt in the place where the dead were, as the prophet says concerning Him: \"And the Lord remembered His dead saints who slept formerly in the land of sepulture; and He descended to them, to rescue and save them.\"[fn-93-P9321_2729885:262-nf] And the Lord Himself says, \"As Jonas remained three days and three nights in the whale's belly, so shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth.\"[fn-93-P9322_2730074:263-nf] Then also the apostle says, \"But when He ascended, what is it but that He also descended into the lower parts of the earth? \"[fn-93-P9323_2730221:264-nf] This, too, David says when prophesying of Him, \"And thou hast delivered my soul from the nethermost hell; \"[fn-93-P9324_2730348:265-nf] and on His rising again the third day, He said to Mary, who was the first to see and to worship Him, \"Touch Me not, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to the disciples, and say unto them, I ascend unto My Father, and unto your Father.\"[fn-93-P9325_2730622:266-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":86,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_57_discourse_i","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"106","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"(5.) If moreover, baffled so far, they should still violently insist that the language is that of comparison, and that comparison in consequence implies oneness of kind, so that the Son is of the nature of Angels, they will in the first price incur the disgrace of rivalling and repeating what Valentinus held, and Carpocrates, and those other heretics, of whom the former said that the Angels were one in kind with the Christ, and Carpocrates that Angels are framers of the world[fn-57-P5704_2263214:344-nf] . Perchance it is under the instruction of these masters that they compare the Word of God with the Angels.57. Though surely amid such speculations, they will be moved by the sacred poet, saying, `Who is he among the gods that shall be like unto the Lord[fn-57-P5705_2263886:345-nf] ,' and, `Among the gods there is none like unto Thee, O Lord[fn-57-P5706_2263969:346-nf] .' However, they must be answered, with the chance of their profiting by it, that comparison confessedly does belong to subjects one in kind, not to those which differ. No one, for instance, would compare God with man, or again man with brutes, nor wood with stone, because their natures are unlike; but God is beyond comparison, and man is compared to man, and wood to wood, and stone to stone. Now in such cases we should not speak of `better,' but of `rather' and `more;' thus Joseph was comely rather than his brethren, and Rachel than Leah; star[fn-57-P5707_2264546:347-nf] is not better than star, but is the rather excellent in glory; whereas in bringing together things which differ in kind, then `better' is used to mark the difference, as has been said in the case of wisdom and jewels. Had then the Apostle said, `by so much has the Son precedence of the Angels,' or `by so much greater,' you would have had a plea, as if the Son were compared with the Angels; but, as it is, in saying that He is `better,' and differs as far as Son from servants, the Apostle shews that He is other than the Angels in nature. (6.) Moreover by saying that He it is who has `laid the foundation of all things[fn-57-P5708_2265192:348-nf] ,' he shews that He is other than all things originate. But if He be other and different in essence from their nature, what comparison of His essence can[fn-57-P5709_2265365:349-nf] there be, or what likeness to them? though, even if they have any such thoughts, Paul shall refute them, who speaks to the very point, `For unto which of the Angels said He at any time, Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee? And of the Angels He saith, Who maketh His Angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire[fn-57-P5710_2265719:350-nf] .'58. Observe here, the word `made' belongs to things originate, and he calls them things made; but to the Son he speaks not of making, nor of becoming, hut of eternity and kingship, and a Framer's office, exclaiming, `Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever;' and, `Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of Thine hands; they shall perish, but Thou remainest.' From which words even they, were they but willing, might perceive that the Framer is other than things framed, the former God, the latter things originate, made out of nothing. For what has been said, `They shall perish,' is said, not as if the creation were destined for destruction, but to express the nature of things originate by the issue to which they tend[fn-57-P5711_2266521:351-nf] . For things which admit of perishing, though through the grace[fn-57-P5712_2266606:352-nf] of their Maker they perish not, yet have come out of nothing, and themselves witness that they once were not. And on this account, since their nature is such, it is said of the Son, `Thou remainest,' to shew His eternity; for not having the capacity of perishing, as things originate have, but having eternal duration, it is foreign to Him to have it said, `He was not before His generation,' but proper to Him to be always, and to endure together with the Father. And though the Apostle had not thus written in his Epistle to the Hebrews, still his other Epistles, and the whole of Scripture, would certainly forbid their entertaining such notions concerning the Word. But since he has here expressly written it, and, as has been above shewn, the Son is Offspring of the Father's essence, and He is Framer, and other things are framed by Him, and He is the Radiance and Word and Image and Wisdom of the Father, and things originate stand and serve in their place below the Triad, therefore the Son is different in kind and different in essence from things originate, and on the contrary is proper to the Father's essence and one in nature with it[fn-57-P5713_2267782:353-nf] . And Hence it is that the Son too says not, `My Father is better than I[fn-57-P5714_2268053:354-nf] ,' lest we should conceive Him to be foreign to His Nature, but `greater,' not indeed in greatness, nor in time, but because of His generation from the Father Himself[fn-57-P5715_2268241:355-nf] , nay, in saying `greater' He again shows that He is proper to His essence.","title":"Discourse I","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":86,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"76","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"50. Your famous assertion then, that the Son is a creature, is not true, but is your fantasy only; nay Solomon convicts you of having many times slandered him. For he has not called Him creature, but God's Offspring and Wisdom, saying, `God in Wisdom established the earth,' and `Wisdom built her an house[fn-61-P6195_2473690:326-nf] .' And the very passage in question proves your irreligious spirit; for it is written, `The Lord created me a beginning of His ways for His works.' Therefore if He is before all things, yet says `He created me' (not `that I might make the works,' but) `for the works,' unless `He created' relates to something later than Himself, He will seem later than the works, finding them on His creation already in existence before Him, for the sake of which He is also brought into being. And if so, how is He before all things notwithstanding? and how were all things made through Him and consist in Him? for behold, you say that the works consisted before Him, for which He is created and sent. But it is not so; perish the thought! false is the supposition of the heretics. For the Word of God is not creature but Creator; and says in the manner of proverbs, `He created me' when He put on created flesh. And something besides may be understood from the passage itself; for, being Son and having God for His Father, for He is His proper Offspring, yet here He names the Father Lord; not that He was servant, but because He took the servant's form. For it became Him, on the one hand being the Word from the Father, to call God Father: for this is proper to son towards father; on the other, having come to finish the work, and taken a servant's form, to name the Father Lord. And this difference He Himself has taught by an apt distinction, saying in the Gospels, `I thank Thee, O Father,' and then, `Lord of heaven and earth[fn-61-P6196_2475250:327-nf] .' For He calls God His Father, but of the creatures He names Him Lord; as shewing clearly from these words, that, when He put on the creature[fn-61-P6197_2475414:328-nf] , then it was He called the Father Lord. For in the prayer of David the Holy. Spirit marks the same distinction, saying in the Psalms, `Give Thy strength unto Thy Child, and help the Son of Thine handmaid[fn-61-P6198_2475654:329-nf] .' For the natural and true child of God is one, and the sons of the handmaid, that is, of the nature of things originate, are other. Wherefore the One, as Son, has the Father's might; but the rest are in need of salvation.51. (But if, because He was called child, they idly talk, let them know that both Isaac was named Abraham's child, and the son of the Shunamite was called young child.) Reasonably then, we being servants, when He became as we, He too calls the Father Lord, as we do; and this He has so done from love to man, that we too, being servants by nature, and receiving the Spirit of the Son, might have confidence to call Him by grace Father, who is by nature our Lord. But as we, in calling the Lord Father, do not deny our servitude by nature (for we are His works, and it is `He that hath made us, and not we ourselves[fn-61-P6199_2476515:330-nf] '), so when the Son, on taking the servant's form, says, `The Lord created me a beginning of His ways,' let them not deny the eternity of His Godhead, and that `in the beginning was the Word,' and `all things were made by Him,' and `in Him all things were created[fn-62-P6200_2476796:331-nf] .'","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":86,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_38_tractate_xxxiii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"7.

For they say, since what the Father wills, the Son wills also, and is not contrary either in what He thinks or in what He judges, but is in all respects concordant[fn-65-P6592_2615167:82-nf] with Him, declaring doctrines which are the same, and a word consistent and united with the Father's teaching, therefore it is that He and the Father are One; and some of them have dared to write as well as say this[fn-65-P6593_2615950:83-nf] .

Why do they reject that of Nicaea, at which their Fathers signed the confession that the Son is of the Father's Essence and coessential with Him? Why do they run about? For now they are at war not only with the bishops who met at Nicaea, but with their own great bishops and their own friends. Whose heirs or successors then are they? How can they call men fathers, whose confession, well and apostolically drawn up, they will not accept? For if they think they can object to it, let them speak, or rather answer, that they may be convicted of falling foul of themselves, whether they believe the Son when He says, `I and my Father are one,' and `he that hath seen Me hath seen the Father[fn-78-P7883_3153113:38-nf] .' `Yes,' they must answer, `since it is written we believe it.' But if they are asked how they are one, and how he that hath seen the Son hath seen the Father, of course, we suppose they will say, `by reason of resemblance,' unless they have quite come to agree with those who hold the brother-opinion to theirs, and are called[fn-78-P7884_3153476:39-nf] Anomoeans. But if once more they are asked, `how is He like?' they brasen it out and say, `by perfect virtue and harmony, by having the same will with the Father, by not willing what the Father wills not.' But let them understand that one assimilated to God by virtue and will is liable also to the purpose of changing; but the Word is not thus, unless He is `like' in part, and as we are, because He is not like [God] in essence also. But these characteristics belong to us, who are originate, and of a created nature. For we too, albeit we cannot become like God in essence, yet by progress in virtue imitate God, the Lord granting us this grace, in the words, `Be ye merciful as your Father is merciful:' `be ye perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect[fn-78-P7885_3154600:40-nf] .' But that originate things are changeable, no one can deny, seeing that angels transgressed, Adam disobeyed, and all stand in need of the grace of the Word. But a mutable thing cannot be like God who is truly unchangeable, any more than what is created can be like its creator. This is why, with regard to us, the holy man said, `Lord, who shall be likened unto thee[fn-78-P7886_3155000:41-nf] ,' and `who among the gods is like unto thee, Lord[fn-78-P7887_3155077:42-nf] ;' meaning by gods those who, while created, had yet become partakers of the Word, as He Himself said, `If he called them gods to whom the word of God came[fn-78-P7888_3155253:43-nf] .' But things which partake cannot be identical with or similar to that whereof they partake. For example, He said of Himself, `I and the Father are one[fn-78-P7889_3155423:44-nf] ,' implying that things originate are not so. For we would ask those who allege the Ariminian Synod, whether a created essence can say, `what things I see my Father make, those I make also[fn-78-P7890_3155628:45-nf] .' For things originate are made and do not make; or else they made even themselves. Why, if, as they say, the Son is a Creature and the Father is His Maker, surely the Son would be His own maker, as He is able to make what the Father makes, as He said. But such a supposition is absurd and utterly untenable, for none can make himself.","title":"To the Bishops of Africa","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":86,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_50_tractate_xlv","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"16","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"14.
