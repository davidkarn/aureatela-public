{"verses":["For the sons of Core, a psalm of a canticle.  The foundations\nthereof are the holy mountains:","The Lord loveth the gates of Sion above all the tabernacles of\nJacob.","Glorious things are said of thee, O city of God.","I will be mindful of Rahab and of Babylon knowing me.  Behold the\nforeigners, and Tyre, and the people of the Ethiopians, these were\nthere.","Shall not Sion say:  This man and that man is born in her?  and the\nHighest himself hath founded her.","The Lord shall tell in his writings of peoples and of princes, of\nthem that have been in her.","The dwelling in thee is as it were of all rejoicing."]}
