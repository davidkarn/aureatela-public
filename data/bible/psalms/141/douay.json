{"verses":["Of understanding for David, A prayer when he was in the cave.  [1\nKings 24.]","I cried to the Lord with my voice:  with my voice I made\nsupplication to the Lord.","In his sight I pour out my prayer, and before him I declare my\ntrouble:","When my spirit failed me, then thou knewest my paths.  In this\nway wherein I walked, they have hidden a snare for me.","I looked on my right hand, and beheld, and there was no one that\nwould know me.  Flight hath failed me:  and there is no one that hath\nregard to my soul.","I cried to thee, O Lord:  I said:  Thou art my hope, my portion in\nthe land of the living.","Attend to my supplication:  for I am brought very low.  Deliver me\nfrom my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.","Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name:  the\njust wait for me, until thou reward me."]}
