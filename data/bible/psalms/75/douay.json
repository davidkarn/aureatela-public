{"verses":["Unto the end, in praises, a psalm for Asaph:  a canticle to the\nAssyrians.","In Judea God is known:  his name is great in Israel.","And his place is in peace:  and his abode in Sion:","There hath he broken the powers of bows, the shield, the sword,\nand the battle.","Thou enlightenest wonderfully from the everlasting hills.","All the foolish of heart were troubled.  They have slept their\nsleep; and all the men of riches have found nothing in their hands.","At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, they have all slumbered that\nmounted on horseback.","Thou art terrible, and who shall resist thee?  from that time thy\nwrath.","Thou hast caused judgment to be heard from heaven:  the earth\ntrembled and was still,","When God arose in judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.","For the thought of man shall give praise to thee:  and the\nremainders of the thought shall keep holiday to thee.","Vow ye, and pay to the Lord your God:  all you that are round\nabout him bring presents.  To him that is terrible,","Even to him who taketh away the spirit of princes:  to the\nterrible with the kings of the earth."]}
