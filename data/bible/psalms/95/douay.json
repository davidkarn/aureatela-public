{"verses":["A canticle for David himself, when the house was built after the\ncaptivity.  Sing ye to the Lord a new canticle:  sing to the Lord, all\nthe earth.","Sing ye to the Lord and bless his name:  shew forth his salvation\nfrom day to day.","Declare his glory among the Gentiles:  his wonders among all\npeople.","For the Lord is great, and exceedingly to be praised:  he is to be\nfeared above all gods.","For all the gods of the Gentiles are devils:  but the Lord made\nthe heavens.","Praise and beauty are before him:  holiness and majesty in his\nsanctuary.","Bring ye to the Lord, O ye kindreds of the Gentiles, bring ye to\nthe Lord glory and honour:","Bring to the Lord glory unto his name.  Bring up sacrifices, and\ncome into his courts:","Adore ye the Lord in his holy court.  Let all the earth be moved\nat his presence.","Say ye among the Gentiles, the Lord hath reigned.  For he hath\ncorrected the world, which shall not be moved:  he will judge the people\nwith justice.","Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad, let the sea\nbe moved, and the fulness thereof:","The fields and all things that are in them shall be joyful.  Then\nshall all the trees of the woods rejoice","before the face of the Lord, because he cometh:  because he\ncometh to judge the earth.  He shall judge the world with justice, and\nthe people with his truth."]}
