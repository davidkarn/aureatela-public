{"verses":["Unto the end, for Idithun, a psalm of Asaph.","I cried to the Lord with my voice; to God with my voice, and he\ngave ear to me.","In the days of my trouble I sought God, with my hands lifted up\nto him in the night, and I was not deceived.  My soul refused to be\ncomforted:","I remembered God, and was delighted, and was exercised, and my\nspirit swooned away.","My eyes prevented the watches:  I was troubled, and I spoke not.","I thought upon the days of old:  and I had in my mind the eternal\nyears.","And I meditated in the night with my own heart:  and I was\nexercised and I swept my spirit.","Will God then cast off for ever?  or will he never be more\nfavourable again?","Or will he cut off his mercy for ever, from generation to\ngeneration?","Or will God forget to shew mercy?  or will he in his anger shut\nup his mercies?","And I said, Now have I begun:  this is the change of the right\nhand of the most High.","I remembered the works of the Lord:  for I will be mindful of thy\nwonders from the beginning.","And I will meditate on all thy works:  and will be employed in\nthy inventions.","Thy way, O God, is in the holy place:  who is the great God like\nour God?","Thou art the God that dost wonders.  Thou hast made thy power\nknown among the nations:","With thy arm thou hast redeemed thy people the children of Jacob\nand of Joseph.","The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee:  and they were\nafraid, and the depths were troubled.","Great was the noise of the waters:  the clouds sent out a sound.\nFor thy arrows pass:","The voice of thy thunder in a wheel.  Thy lightnings enlightened\nthe world:  the earth shook and trembled.","Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in many waters:  and thy\nfootsteps shall not be known.","Thou hast conducted thy people like sheep, by the hand of Moses\nand Aaron."]}
