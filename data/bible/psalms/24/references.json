The law prohibits the gods of the nations from being named,[fn-8-P832_333603:162-nf] not of course that we are not to pronounce their names, the speaking of which common intercourse extorts from us: for this must very frequently be said, \"You find him in the temple of Â¦sculapius; \"and, \"I live in Isis Street; \"and, \"He has been made priest of Jupiter; \"and much else after this manner, since even on men names of this kind are bestowed.

So far, my brother, as the question proposed by you is concerned, you have our opinion in answer and encouragement. But he who inquires whether persecution ought to be shunned by us must now be prepared to consider the following question also: Whether, if we should not flee from it, we should at least buy ourselves off from it. Going further than you expected, therefore, I will also on this point give you my advice, distinctly affirming that persecution, from which it is evident we must not flee, must in like manner not even be bought off. The difference lies in the payment; but as flight is a buying off without money, so buying off is money-flight. Assuredly you have here too the counselling of fear. Because you fear, you buy yourself off; and so you flee. As regards your feet, you have stood; in respect of the money you have paid, you have run away. Why, in this very standing of yours there was a fleeing from persecution, in the release from persecution which you bought; but that you should ransom with money a man whom Christ has ransomed with His blood, how unworthy is it of God and His ways of acting, who spared not His own Son for you, that He might be made a curse for us, because cursed is he that hangeth on a tree,[fn-19-P1990_603475:47-nf] -Him who was led as a sheep to be a sacrifice, and just as a lamb before its shearer, so opened He not His mouth;[fn-19-P1991_603623:48-nf] but gave His back to the scourges, nay, His cheeks to the hands of the smiter, and turned not away His face from spitting, and, being numbered with the transgressors, was delivered up to death, nay, the death of the cross. All this took place that He might redeem us from our sins. The sun ceded to us the day of our redemption; hell re-transferred the right it had in us, and our covenant is in heaven; the everlasting gates were lifted up, that the King of Glory, the Lord of might, might enter in,[fn-19-P1992_604143:49-nf] after having redeemed man from earth, nay, from hell, that he might attain to heaven. What, now, are we to think of the man who strives against that glorious One, nay, slights and defiles His goods, obtained at so great a ransom-no less, in truth, than His most precious blood? It appears, then, that it is better to flee than to fall in value, if a man will not lay out for himself as much as he cost Christ. And the Lord indeed ransomed him from the angelic powers which rule the world-from the spirits of wickedness, from the darkness of this life, from eternal judgment, from everlasting death. But you bargain for him with an informer, or a soldier or some paltry thief of a ruler-under, as they say, the folds of the tunic-as if he were stolen goods whom Christ purchased in the face of the whole world, yes, and set at liberty. Will you value, then, this free man at any price, and possess him at any price, but the one, as we have said, it cost the Lord,-namely, His own blood? (And if not,) why then do you purchase Christ in the man in whom He dwells, as though He were some human property? No otherwise did Simon even try to do, when he offered the apostles money for the Spirit of Christ. Therefore this man also, who in buying himself has bought the Spirit of Christ, will hear that word, \"Your money perish with you, since you have thought that the grace of God is to be had at a price!\"[fn-19-P1993_605563:50-nf] Yet who will despise him for being (what he is), a denier? For what says that extorter? Give me money: assuredly that he may not deliver him up, since he tries to sell you nothing else than that which he is going to give you for money. When you put that into his hands, it is certainly your wish not to be delivered up. But not delivered up, had you to be held up to public ridicule? While, then, in being unwilling to be delivered up, you are not willing to be thus exposed; by this unwillingness of yours you have denied that you are what you have been unwilling to have it made public that you are. Nay, you say, While I am unwilling to be held up to the public as being what I am, I have acknowledged that I am what I am unwilling to be so held up as being, that is, a Christian. Can Christ, therefore, claim that you, as a witness for Him, have stedfastly shown Him forth? He who buys himself off does nothing in that way. Before one it might, I doubt not, be said, You have confessed Him; so also, on the account of your unwillingness to confess Him before many you have denied Him. A man's very safety will pronounce that he has fallen while getting out of persecution's way. He has fallen, therefore, whose desire has been to escape. The refusal of martyrdom is denial. A Christian is preserved by his wealth, and for this end has his treasures, that he may not suffer, while he will be rich toward God. But it is the case that Christ was rich in blood for him. Blessed therefore are the poor, because, He says, the kingdom of heaven is theirs who have the soul only treasured up.[fn-19-P1994_607173:51-nf] If we cannot serve God and mammon, can we be redeemed both by God and by mammon? For who will serve mammon more than the man whom mammon has ransomed? Finally, of what example do you avail yourself to warrant your averting by money the giving of you up? When did the apostles, dealing with the matter, in any time of persecution trouble, extricate themselves by money? And money they certainly had from the prices of lands which were laid down at their feet,[fn-19-P1995_607649:52-nf] there being, without a doubt, many of the rich among those who believed-men, and also women, who were wont, too, to minister to their comfort. When did Onesimus, or Aquila, or Stephen,[fn-19-P1996_607856:53-nf] give them aid of this kind when they were persecuted? Paul indeed, when Felix the governor hoped that he should receive money for him from the disciples,[fn-19-P1997_608052:54-nf] about which matter he also dealt with the apostle in private, certainly neither paid it himself, nor did the disciples for him. Those disciples, at any rate. who wept because he was equally persistent in his determination to go to Jerusalem, and neglectful of all means to secure himself from the persecutions which had been foretold as about to occur there, at last say, \"Let the will of the Lord be done.\" What was that will? No doubt that he should suffer for the name of the Lord, not that he should be bought off. For as Christ laid down His life for us, so, too, we should do for Him; and not only for the Lord Himself, nay, but likewise for our brethren on His account. This, too, is the teaching of John when he declares, not that we should pay for our brethren, but rather that we should die for them. It makes no difference whether the thing not to be done by you is to buy off a Christian, or to buy one. And so the will of God accords with this. Look at the condition-certainly of God's ordaining, in whose hand the king's heart is-of kingdoms and empires. For increasing the treasury there are daily provided so many appliances-registerings of property, taxes in kind benevolences, taxes in money; but never up to this time has ought of the kind been provided by bringing Christians under some purchase-money for the person and the sect, although enormous gains could be reaped from numbers too great for any to be ignorant of them. Bought with blood, paid for with blood, we owe no money for our head, because Christ is our Head. It is not fit that Christ should cost us money. How could martyrdoms, too, take place to the glory of the Lord, if by tribute we should pay for the liberty of our sect? And so he who stipulates to have it at a price, opposes the divine appointment. Since, therefore, Caesar has imposed nothing on us after this fashion of a tributary sect-in fact, such an imposition never can be made,-with Antichrist now close at hand, and gaping for the blood, not for the money of Christians-how can it be pointed out to me that there is the command, \"Render to Caesar the things which are Caesar's? \"[fn-19-P1998_610207:55-nf] A soldier, be he an informer or an enemy, extorts money from me by threats, exacting nothing on Caesar's behalf; nay, doing the very opposite, when for a bribe he lets me go-Christian as I am, and by the laws of man a criminal. Of another sort is the denarius which I owe to Caesar, a thing belonging to him, about which the question then was started, it being a tribute coin due indeed by those subject to tribute, not by children. Or how shall I render to God the things which are God's,-certainly, therefore, His own likeness and money inscribed with His name, that is, a Christian man? But what do I owe God, as I do Caesar the denarius, but the blood which His own Son shed for me? Now if I owe God, indeed, a human being and my own blood; but I am now in this juncture, that a demand is made upon me for the payment of that debt, I am undoubtedly guilty of cheating God if I do my best to withhold payment. I have well kept the commandment, if, rendering to Caesar the things which are Caesar's, I refuse to God the things which are God's!","title":"IX.

Nothing of the kind. But the elements own[fn-60-P6030_1814772:735-nf] their own Maker, just as they had been accustomed to obey His servants also. Examine well the Exodus, Marcion; look at the rod of Moses, as it waves His command to the Red Sea, ampler than all the lakes of JudÂµa. How the sea yawns from its very depths, then fixes itself in two solidified masses, and so, out of the interval between them,[fn-60-P6031_1815128:736-nf] makes a way for the people to pass dry-shod across; again does the same rod vibrate, the sea returns in its strength, and in the concourse of its waters the chivalry of Egypt is engulphed! To that consummation the very winds subserved! Read, too, how that the Jordan was as a sword, to hinder the emigrant nation in their passage across its stream; how that its waters from above stood still, and its current below wholly ceased to run at the bidding of Joshua,[fn-60-P6032_1815641:737-nf] when his priests began to pass over![fn-60-P6033_1815702:738-nf] What will you say to this? If it be your Christ that is meant above, he will not be more potent than the servants of the Creator. But I should have been content with the examples I have adduced without addition,[fn-60-P6034_1816768:739-nf] if a prediction of His present passage on the sea had not preceded Christ's coming. As psalm is, in fact, accomplished by this[fn-60-P6035_1816909:740-nf] crossing over the lake. \"The Lord,\" says the psalmist, \"is upon many waters.\"[fn-60-P6036_1817001:741-nf] When He disperses its waves, Habakkuk's words are fulfilled, where he says, \"Scattering the waters in His passage.\"[fn-60-P6037_1817137:742-nf] When at His rebuke the sea is calmed, Nahum is also verified: He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry,\"[fn-60-P6038_1817290:743-nf] including the winds indeed, whereby it was disquieted. With what evidence would you have my Christ vindicated? Shall it come from the examples, or from the prophecies, of the Creator? You suppose that He is predicted as a military and armed warrior,[fn-60-P6039_1817558:744-nf] instead of one who in a figurative and allegorical sense was to wage a spiritual warfare against spiritual enemies, in spiritual campaigns, and with spiritual weapons: come now, when in one man alone you discover a multitude of demons calling itself Legion,[fn-60-P6040_1817856:745-nf] of course comprised of spirits, you should learn that Christ also must be understood to be an exterminator of spiritual foes, who wields spiritual arms and fights in spiritual strife; and that it was none other than He,[fn-60-P6041_1818098:746-nf] who now had to contend with even a legion of demons. Therefore it is of such a war as this that the Psalm may evidently have spoken: \"The Lord is strong, The Lord is mighty in battle.\"[fn-60-P6042_1818312:747-nf] For with the last enemy death did He fight, and through the trophy of the cross He triumphed. Now of what God did the Legion testify that Jesus was the Son?[fn-60-P6043_1818489:748-nf] No doubt, of that God whose torments and abyss they knew and dreaded. It seems impossible for them to have remained up to this time in ignorance of what the power of the recent and unknown god was working in the world, because it is very unlikely that the Creator was ignorant thereof. For if He had been at any time ignorant that there was another god above Himself, He had by this time at all events discovered that there was one at work[fn-60-P6044_1818951:749-nf] below His heaven. Now, what their Lord had discovered had by this time become notorious to His entire family within the same world and the same circuit of heaven, in which the strange deity dwelt and acted.[fn-60-P6045_1819174:750-nf] As therefore both the Creator and His creatures[fn-60-P6046_1819244:751-nf] must have had knowledge of him, if he had been in existence, so, inasmuch as he had no existence, the demons really knew none other than the Christ of their own God. They do not ask of the strange god, what they recollected they must beg of the Creator-not to be plunged into the Creator's abyss. They at last had their request granted. On what ground? Because they had lied? Because they had proclaimed Him to be the Son of a ruthless God? And what sort of god will that be who helped the lying, and upheld his detractors? However, no need of this thought, for,[fn-60-P6047_1819851:752-nf] inasmuch as they had not lied, inasmuch as they had acknowledged that the God of the abyss was also their God, so did He actually Himself affirm that He was the same whom these demons acknowledged-Jesus, the Judge and Son of the avenging God. Now, behold an inkling[fn-60-P6048_1820160:753-nf] of the Creator's failings[fn-60-P6049_1820202:754-nf] and infirmities in Christ; for I on my side[fn-60-P6050_1820269:755-nf] mean to impute to Him ignorance. Allow me some indulgence in my effort against the heretic. Jesus is touched by the woman who had an issue of blood,[fn-60-P6051_1820430:756-nf] He knew not by whom. \"Who touched me? \"He asks, when His disciples alleged an excuse. He even persists in His assertion of ignorance: \"Somebody hath touched me,\" He says, and advances some proof: \"For I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.\" What says our heretic? Could Christ have known the person? And why did He speak as if He were ignorant? Why? Surely it was to challenge her faith, and to try her fear. Precisely as He had once questioned Adam, as if in ignorance: Adam, where art thou? \"[fn-60-P6052_1820952:757-nf] Thus you have both the Creator excused in the same way as Christ, and Christ acting similarly to[fn-60-P6053_1821088:758-nf] the Creator. But in this case He acted as an adversary of the law; and therefore, as the law forbids contact with a woman with an issue,[fn-60-P6054_1821257:759-nf] He desired not only that this woman should touch Him, but that He should heal her.[fn-60-P6055_1821360:760-nf] Here, then, is a God who is not merciful by nature, but in hostility! Yet, if we find that such was the merit of this woman's faith, that He said unto her, Thy faith hath saved thee.\"[fn-60-P6056_1821577:761-nf] what are you, that you should detect an hostility to the law in that act, which the Lord Himself shows us to have been done as a reward of faith? But will you have it that this faith of the woman consisted in the contempt which she had acquired for the law? Who can suppose, that a woman who had been. hitherto unconscious of any God, uninitiated as yet in any new law, should violently infringe that law by which she was up to this time bound? On what faith, indeed, was such an infringement hazarded? In what God believing? Whom despising? The Creator? Her touch at least was an act of faith. And if of faith in the Creator, how could she have violated His law,[fn-60-P6057_1822263:762-nf] when she was ignorant of any other God? Whatever her infringement of the law amounted to, it proceeded from and was proportionate to her faith in the Creator. But how can these two things be compatible? That she violated the law, and violated it in faith, which ought to have restrained her from such violation? I will tell you how her faith was this above all:[fn-60-P6058_1822662:763-nf] it made her believe that her God preferred mercy even to sacrifice; she was certain that her God was working in Christ; she touched Him, therefore, nor as a holy man simply, nor as a prophet, whom she knew to be capable of contamination by reason of his human nature, but as very God, whom she assumed to be beyond all possibility of pollution by any uncleanness.[fn-60-P6059_1823040:764-nf] She therefore, not without reason,[fn-60-P6060_1823093:765-nf] interpreted for herself the law, as meaning that such things as are susceptible of defilement become defiled, but not so God, whom she knew for certain to be in Christ. But she recollected this also, that what came under the prohibition of the law[fn-60-P6061_1823360:766-nf] was that ordinary and usual issue of blood which proceeds from natural functions every month, and in childbirth, not that which was the result of disordered health. Her case, however, was one of long abounding[fn-60-P6062_1823593:767-nf] ill health, for which she knew that the succour of God's mercy was needed, and not the natural relief of time. And thus she may: evidently be regarded as having discerned[fn-60-P6063_1823794:768-nf] the law, instead of breaking it. This will prove to be the faith which was to confer intelligence likewise. \"If ye will not believe,\" says (the prophet), \"ye shall not understand.\"[fn-60-P6064_1823995:769-nf] When Christ approved of the faith of this woman, which simply rested in the Creator, He declared by His answer to her,[fn-60-P6065_1824134:770-nf] that He was Himself the divine object of the faith of which He approved. Nor can I overlook the fact that His garment, by being touched, demonstrated also the truth of His body; for of course\"[fn-60-P6066_1824349:771-nf] it was a body, and not a phantom, which the garment clothed.[fn-60-P6067_1824425:772-nf] This indeed is not our point now; but the remark has a natural bearing on the question we are discussing. For if it were not a veritable body, but only a fantastic one, it could not for certain have received contamination, as being an unsubstantial thing.[fn-60-P6068_1824749:773-nf] He therefore, who, by reason of this vacuity of his substance, was incapable of contamination, how could he possibly have desired this touch?[fn-60-P6069_1824913:774-nf] As an adversary of the law, his conduct was deceitful, for he was not susceptible of a real pollution.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":24,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"62","folder":"ANF-03","text":"We have it on the true tradition[fn-79-P7952_2264515:757-nf] of the Church, that this epistle was sent to the Ephesians, not to the Laodiceans. Marcion, however, was very desirous of giving it the new rifle (of Laodicean),[fn-79-P7953_2264695:758-nf] as if he were extremely accurate in investigating such a point. But of what consequence are the titles, since in writing to a certain church the apostle did in fact write to all? It is certain that, whoever they were to whom he wrote,[fn-79-P7954_2264997:759-nf] he declared Him to be God in Christ with whom all things agree which are predicted. Now, to what god will most suitably belong all those things which relate to \"that good pleasure, which God hath purposed in the mystery of His will, that in the dispensation of the fulness of times He might recapitulate\" (if I may so say, according to the exact meaning of the Greek word[fn-79-P7955_2265389:760-nf] ) \"all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth,\"[fn-79-P7956_2265517:761-nf] but to Him whose are all things from their beginning, yea the beginning itself too; from whom issue the times and the dispensation of the fulness of times, according to which all things up to the very first are gathered up in Christ? What beginning, however, has the other god; that is to say, how can anything proceed from him, who has no work to show? And if there be no beginning, how can there be times? If no times, what fulness of times can there be? And if no fulness, what dispensation? Indeed, what has he ever done on earth, that any long dispensation of times to be fulfilled can be put to his account, for the accomplishment of all things in Christ, even of things in heaven? Nor can we possibly suppose that any things whatever have been at any time done in heaven by any other God than Him by whom, as all men allow, all things have been done on earth. Now, if it is impossible for all these things from the beginning to be reckoned to any other God than the Creator, who will believe that an alien god has recapitulated them in an alien Christ, instead of their own proper Author in His own Christ? If, again, they belong to the Creator, they must needs be separate from the other god; and if separate, then opposed to him. But then how can opposites be gathered together into him by whom they are in short destroyed? Again, what Christ do the following words announce, when the apostle says: \"That we should be to the praise of His glory, who first trusted in Christ? \"[fn-79-P7957_2267025:762-nf] Now who could have first trusted-i.e. previously trusted[fn-79-P7958_2267101:763-nf] -in God, before His advent, except the Jews to whom Christ was previously announced, from the beginning? He who was thus foretold, was also foretrusted. Hence the apostle refers the statement to himself, that is, to the Jews, in order that he may draw a distinction with respect to the Gentiles, (when he goes on to say: ) \"In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel (of your salvation); in whom ye believed, and were sealed with His Holy Spirit of promise.\"[fn-79-P7959_2267644:764-nf] Of what promise? That which was made through Joel: \"In the last days will I pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh,\"[fn-79-P7960_2267778:765-nf] that is, on all nations. Therefore the Spirit and the Gospel will be found in the Christ, who was foretrusted, because foretold. Again, \"the Father of glory\"[fn-79-P7961_2267956:766-nf] is He whose Christ, when ascending to heaven, is celebrated as \"the King of Glory\" in the Psalm: \"Who is this King of Glory? the Lord of Hosts, He is the King of Glory.\"[fn-79-P7962_2268146:767-nf] From Him also is besought \"the spirit of wisdom,\"[fn-79-P7963_2268217:768-nf] at whose disposal is enumerated that sevenfold distribution of the spirit of grace by Isaiah.[fn-79-P7964_2268330:769-nf] He likewise will grant \"the enlightenment of the eyes of the understanding,\"[fn-79-P7965_2268426:770-nf] who has also enriched our natural eyes with light; to whom, moreover, the blindness of the people is offensive: \"And who is blind, but my servants? ... yea, the servants of God have become blind.\"[fn-79-P7966_2268640:771-nf] In His gift, too, are \"the riches (of the glory) of His inheritance in the saints,\"[fn-79-P7967_2268754:772-nf] who promised such an inheritance in the call of the Gentiles: \"Ask of me, and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance.\"[fn-79-P7968_2268904:773-nf] It was He who \"wrought in Christ His mighty power, by raising Him from the dead, and setting Him at His own right hand, and putting all things under His feet\"[fn-79-P7969_2269081:774-nf] -even the same who said: \"Sit Thou on my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\"[fn-79-P7970_2269199:775-nf] For in another passage the Spirit says to the Father concerning the Son: \"Thou hast put all things under His feet.\"[fn-79-P7971_2269333:776-nf] Now, if from all these facts which are found in the Creator there is yet to be deduced[fn-79-P7972_2269440:777-nf] another god and another Christ, let us go in quest of the Creator. I suppose, forsooth,[fn-79-P7973_2269545:778-nf] we find Him, when he speaks of such as \"were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein they had walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, who worketh in the children of disobedience.\"[fn-79-P7974_2269792:779-nf] But Marcion must not here interpret the world as meaning the God of the world.[fn-79-P7975_2269893:780-nf] For a creature bears no resemblance to the Creator; the thing made, none to its Maker; the world, none to God. He, moreover, who is the Prince of the power of the ages must not be thought to be called the prince of the power of the air; for He who is chief over the higher powers derives no title from the lower powers, although these, too, may be ascribed to Him. Nor, again, can He possibly seem to be the instigator[fn-79-P7976_2270363:781-nf] of that unbelief which He Himself had rather to endure at the hand of the Jews and the Gentiles alike. We may therefore simply conclude that[fn-79-P7977_2270587:782-nf] these designations are unsuited to the Creator. There is another being to whom they are more applicable-and the apostle knew very well who that was. Who then is he? Undoubtedly he who has raised up \"children of disobedience\" against the Creator Himself ever since he took possession of that \"air\" of His; even as the prophet makes him say: \"I will set my throne above the stars; ... I will go up above the clouds; I will be like the Most High.\"[fn-79-P7978_2271057:783-nf] This must mean the devil, whom in another passage (since such will they there have the apostle's meaning to be) we shall recognize in the appellation the god of this world.[fn-79-P7979_2271297:784-nf] For he has filled the whole world with the lying pretence of his own divinity. To be sure,[fn-79-P7980_2271481:785-nf] if he had not existed, we might then possibly have applied these descriptions to the Creator. But the apostle, too, had lived in Judaism; and when he parenthetically observed of the sins (of that period of his life), \"in which also we all had our conversation in times past,\"[fn-79-P7981_2271798:786-nf] he must not be understood to indicate that the Creator was the lord of sinful men, and the prince of this air; but as meaning that in his Judaism he had been one of the children of disobedience, having the devil as his instigator-when he persecuted the church and the Christ of the Creator. Therefore he says: \"We also were the children of wrath,\" but \"by nature.\"[fn-79-P7982_2272182:787-nf] Let the heretic, however, not contend that, because the Creator called the Jews children, therefore the Creator is the lord of wrath.[fn-79-P7983_2272335:788-nf] For when (the apostle) says,\" We were by nature the children of wrath,\" inasmuch as the Jews were not the Creator's children by nature, but by the election of their fathers, he (must have) referred their being children of wrath to nature, and not to the Creator, adding this at lasts\" even as others,\"[fn-79-P7984_2272664:789-nf] who, of course, were not children of God. It is manifest that sins, and lusts of the flesh, and unbelief, and anger, are ascribed to the common nature of all mankind, the devil [however leading that nature astray,[fn-79-P7985_2272897:790-nf] which he has already infected with the implanted germ of sin. \"We,\" says he, \"are His workmanship, created in Christ.\"[fn-79-P7986_2273033:791-nf] It is one thing to make (as a workman), another thing to create. But he assigns both to One. Man is the workmanship of the Creator. He therefore who made man (at first), created him also in Christ. As touching the substance of nature, He \"made\" him; as touching the work of grace, He \"created\" him. Look also at what follows in connection with these words: \"Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which has the name of circumcision in the flesh made by the hand-that at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise,[fn-79-P7987_2273717:792-nf] having no hope, and without God in the world.\"[fn-79-P7988_2273817:793-nf] Now, without what God and without what Christ were these Gentiles? Surely, without Him to whom the commonwealth[fn-79-P7989_2273953:794-nf] of Israel belonged, and the covenants and the promise. \"But now in Christ,\" says he, \"ye who were sometimes far off are made nigh by His blood.\"[fn-79-P7990_2274153:795-nf] From whom were they far off before? From the privileges) whereof he speaks above, even tom the Christ of the Creator, from the commonwealth of Israel, from the covenants, from the hope of the promise, from God Himself. Since this is the case, the Gentiles are consequently now in Christ made nigh to these (blessings), from which they were once far off. But if we are in Christ brought so very nigh to the commonwealth of Israel, which comprises the religion of the divine Creator, and to the covenants and to the promise, yea to their very God Himself, it is quite ridiculous (to suppose that) the Christ of the other god has brought us to this proximity to the Creator from afar. The apostle had in mind that it had been predicted concerning the call of the Gentiles from their distant alienation in words like these: \"They who were far off from me have come to my righteousness.\"[fn-79-P7991_2275057:796-nf] For the Creator's righteousness no less than His peace was announced in Christ, as we have often shown already. Therefore he says: \"He is our peace, who hath made both one\"[fn-79-P7992_2275308:797-nf] -that is, the Jewish nation and the Gentile world. What is near, and what was far off now that \"the middle wall has been broken down\" of their \"enmity,\" (are made one) \"in His flesh.\"[fn-79-P7993_2275512:798-nf] But Marcion erased the pronoun His, that he might make the enmity refer to flesh, as if (the apostle spoke) of a carnal enmity, instead of the enmity which was a rival to Christ.[fn-79-P7994_2275711:799-nf] And thus you have (as I have said elsewhere) exhibited the stupidity of Pontus, rather than the adroitness of a Marrucinian,[fn-79-P7995_2275894:800-nf] for you here deny him flesh to whom in the verse above you allowed blood! Since, however, He has made the law obsolete[fn-79-P7996_2276098:801-nf] by His own precepts, even by Himself fulfilling the law (for superfluous is, \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" when He says, \"Thou shalt not look on a woman to lust after her; \"superfluous also is, \"Thou shalt do no murder,\" when He says, \"Thou shalt not speak evil of thy neighbour,\") it is impossible to make an adversary of the law out of one who so completely promotes it.[fn-79-P7997_2276496:802-nf] \"For to create[fn-79-P7998_2276531:803-nf] in Himself of twain,\" for He who had made is also the same who creates (just as we have found it stated above: \"For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus\"),[fn-79-P7999_2276788:804-nf] \"one new man, making peace\" (really new, and really man-no phantom-but new, and newly born of a virgin by the Spirit of God), \"that He might reconcile both unto God\"[fn-80-P8000_2276974:805-nf] (even the God whom both races had offended-both Jew and Gentile), \"in one body,\" says he, \"having in it slain the enmity by the cross.\"[fn-80-P8001_2277133:806-nf] Thus we find from this passage also, that there was in Christ a fleshly body, such as was able to endure the cross. \"When, therefore, He came and preached peace to them that were near and to them which were afar off,\" we both obtained \"access to the Father,\" being \"now no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God\" (even of Him from whom, as we have shown above, we were aliens, and placed far off), \"built upon the foundation of the apostles\"[fn-80-P8002_2277652:807-nf] -(the apostle added), \"and the prophets; \"these words, however, the heretic erased, forgetting that the Lord had set in His Church not only apostles, but prophets also. He feared, no doubt, that our building was to stand in Christ upon the foundation of the ancient prophets,[fn-80-P8003_2277951:808-nf] since the apostle himself never fails to build us up everywhere with (the words of) the prophets. For whence did he learn to call Christ \"the chief corner-stone,\"[fn-80-P8004_2278282:809-nf] but from the figure given him in the Psalm: \"The stone which the builders rejected is become the head (stone) of the corner? \"[fn-80-P8005_2278429:810-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":24,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"155","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In Isaiah: \"In the last times the mountain of the Lord shall be revealed, and the house of God upon the tops of the mountains; and it shall be exalted above the hills, and all nations shall come upon it, and many shall walk and say, Come, and let us go up into the mountain of the Lord, and into the house of the God of Jacob; and He will tell us His way, and we will walk in it.

And consequently not only they, but all those too who agree with them, are to be rejected, and are rendered infamous. We hold that the same should also be the case with robbers, or with those who assault the elderly. The laws of the world, indeed, put such persons to death; but we, with whom mercy has the first place, receive them under the mark of infamy to repentance. That infamy also with which they are stained, we are not able to remove; but our desire is to heal their souls by public penitence, and by satisfaction made to the Church: for public sins are not to be purged by secret correction. Those, again, who are suspected in the matter of the right faith, should by no means be admitted to prefer charges against priests, and against those of whose faith there is no doubt; and such persons should be held of doubtful authority in matters of human testimony. Their voice, consequently, should bereckoned invalid whose faith is doubted; and no credit should be given to those who are ignorant of the right faith. Accordingly, in judgment, inquiry should be made as to the conversation and faith of the person who accuses, and of him who is accused; since those who are not of correct conversation and faith, and whose life is open to impeachment, are not allowed to accuse their eiders, neither can such permission be given to those whose faith and life and liberty are unknown. Nor should vile persons be admitted to accuse them. But a clear examination is to be made as to what kind of persons the accusers are (rimandoesunt enucleatim personaeaccusatorum); for they are not to be admitted readily without writing, and are never to be admitted as accusers on mere writing. For no one may either accuse or be accused by mere writing, but with the living voice; and every one must lay his accusation in the presence of him whom he seeks to accuse. And no credit should be given to any accuser in the absence of him whom he seeks to accuse. In like manner, witnesses must not prefer their evidence by writing only; but they must give their testimony truthfully in their own persons, and in matters which they have seen and do know. And they are not to give evidence in any other cases or matters but in those which are known to have happened in their presence. Accusers, moreover, of one blood, are not to bear witness against those who are not related to the family, nor is that to be the case with domestics (familiares) or those proceeding from the house; but if it is their wish, and they agree among themselves, the parents only should give evidence in such cases, and not others. Neither accusers nor witnesses should be admitted who are open to any suspicion; for the feeling of relationship, or friendship, or lordship, is wont to impede the truth. Carnal love, and fear, and avarice, commonly blunt the perceptions of men, and pervert their opinions; so that they look on gain as godliness, and on money as the reward of prudence. Let no one, then, speak deceitfully to his neighbour.[fn-90-P9008_2926670:10-nf] The mouth of the malevolent is a deep pit. The innocent man, while he believes easily, falls readily; but though he falls, he rises; and the shuffler, with all his arts, goes headlong to ruin, whence he can never rise or escape. Therefore let every one weigh well his words, and let him not say to another what he would not say to himself. Whence the sacred Scripture says well: \"Do not that to another which thou wouldest not have done to thyself.\"[fn-90-P9009_2927138:11-nf] For we need time to do anything perfectly (maturius); and let us not be precipitate in our counsels or our works, neither let us violate order. But if any one has fallen in anything, let us not consign him to ruin; but let us reprove him with brotherly affection, as the blessed apostle says: \"If a man be overtaken in any fault, ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, test thou also be tempted. Bear ye one another's burden, and so will ye fulfil the law of Christ.\"[fn-90-P9010_2927683:12-nf] Furthermore, the sainted David had deadly crimes to repent of, and yet he was continued in honour. The blessed Peter also shed the bitterest tears when he repented of having denied the Lord; but still he abode an apostle. And the Lord by the prophet makes this promise to the sinning: \"In the day that the sinner is converted, and repenteth, I will not mention any more against him all his transgressions.\"[fn-90-P9011_2928110:13-nf] ","title":"The Second Epistle","author":"The Decretals"},{"chapter":24,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_121_the_second_epistle","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"31","folder":"ANF-08","text":"For those are in error who think that the priests of the Lord, after a lapse, although they may have exhibited true repentance, are not capable of ministering to the Lord, and engaging their honourable offices, though they may lead a good life thereafter, and keep their priesthood correctly. And those who hold this opinion are not only in error, but also seem to dispute and act in opposition to the power of the keys committed to the Church, whereof it is said: \"Whatsoever ye shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.\"[fn-90-P9016_2928722:14-nf] And in short, this opinion either is not the Lord's, or it is true. But be that as it may, we believe without hesitation, that both the priests of the Lord and other believers may return to their honours after a proper satisfaction for their error, as the Lord Himself testifies by His prophet: \"Shall he who falls not also rise again? and shall he who turns away not return? \"[fn-90-P9017_2929122:15-nf] And in another passage the Lord says: \"I desire not the death of the sinner, but that he may turn, and live.\"[fn-90-P9018_2929251:16-nf] And the prophet David, on his repentance, said: \"Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation, and uphold me with Thy free Spirit.\"[fn-90-P9019_2929416:17-nf] And he indeed, after his repentance, taught others also, and offered sacrifice to God, giving thereby an example to the teachers of the holy Church, that if they have fallen, and thereafter have exhibited a right repentance to God, they may do both things in like manner. For he taught when he said: \"I will teach transgressors Thy ways, and sinners shall be converted unto Thee.\"[fn-90-P9020_2929814:18-nf] And he offered sacrifice for himself, while he said: \"The sacrifice for God is a broken spirit.\"[fn-90-P9021_2929928:19-nf] For the prophet, seeing his own transgressions purged by repentance, had no doubt as to healing those of others by preaching, and by making offering to God. Thus the shedding of tears moves the mind's feeling (passionem). And when the satisfaction is made good, the mind is turned aside from anger. For how does that man think that mercy will be shown to himself, who does not forgive his neighbour? If offences abound, then, let mercy also abound; for with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him is plenteous redemption.[fn-90-P9022_2930467:20-nf] In the Lord's hand there is abundance of all things, because He is the Lord of powers (virtutum) and the King of glory.[fn-90-P9023_2930605:21-nf] For the apostle says: \"All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; being justified freely by His grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, `I say, 'at this time His righteousness, that He might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.\"[fn-90-P9024_2931088:22-nf] And David says: \"Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.\"[fn-90-P9025_2931204:23-nf] Man, therefore, is cleansed of his sin, and rises again by the grace of God though he has fallen, and abides in his first position, according to the above-cited authorities. Let him see to it that he sin no more, that the sentence of the Gospel may abide in him: \"Go, and sin no more.\"[fn-90-P9026_2931509:24-nf] Whence the apostle says: \"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof: neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace. What then? shall we sin because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid. Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin; but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness. I speak after the manner of men.\"[fn-90-P9027_2932427:25-nf] For greater is the sin of him who judgeth, than of him who is judged. \"Thinkest thou,\" says the apostle, \"O man, that judgest them that do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God? or despisest thou the riches of His goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering? Dost thou not know that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? But, after thy hardness and impenitent heart, thou treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; who will render to every man according to his deeds: to them who, by patient continuance in well-doing, seek for glory, and honour, and immortality, eternal life; but unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek: but glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good.\"[fn-90-P9028_2933421:26-nf] My brethren, shun not only the holding, but even the hearing, of the judgment that bans mercy; for better is mercy than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices.[fn-90-P9029_2933604:27-nf] We have replied to your interrogations shortly, because your letter found us burdened overmuch, and preoccupied with other judgments.

For He did not all at once inundate light with the splendour of the sun, nor all at once temper darkness with the moon's assuaging ray.[fn-85-P8523_2400071:273-nf] The heaven He did not all at once bedeck[fn-85-P8524_2400158:274-nf] with constellations and stars, nor did He at once fill the seas with their teeming monsters.[fn-85-P8525_2400272:275-nf] The earth itself He did not endow with its varied fruitfulness all at once; but at first He bestowed upon it being, and then He filled it, that it might not be made in vain.[fn-85-P8526_2400462:276-nf] For thus says Isaiah: \"He created it not in vain; He formed it to be inhabited.\"[fn-85-P8527_2400567:277-nf] Therefore after it was made, and while awaiting its perfect state,[fn-85-P8528_2400655:278-nf] it was \"without form, and void: \"\"void\" indeed, from the very fact that it was without form (as being not yet perfect to the sight, and at the same time unfurnished as yet with its other qualities);[fn-85-P8529_2400884:279-nf] and \"without form,\" because it was still covered with waters, as if with the rampart of its fecundating moisture,[fn-85-P8530_2401034:280-nf] by which is produced our flesh, in a form allied with its own. For to this purport does David say:[fn-85-P8531_2401159:281-nf] \"The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and all that dwell therein: He hath rounded it upon the seas, and on the streams hath He established it.\"[fn-85-P8532_2401366:282-nf] It was when the waters were withdrawn into their hollow abysses that the dry land became conspicuous,[fn-85-P8533_2401488:283-nf] which was hitherto covered with its watery envelope. Then it forthwith becomes \"visible,\"[fn-85-P8534_2401597:284-nf] God saying, \"Let the water be gathered together into one mass,[fn-85-P8535_2401790:285-nf] and let the dry land appear.\"[fn-85-P8536_2401849:286-nf] \"Appear,\" says He, not \"be made.\" It had been already made, only in its invisible condition it was then waiting[fn-85-P8537_2401979:287-nf] to appear. \"Dry,\" because it was about to become such by its severance from the moisture, but yet \"land.\" \"And God called the dry land Earth,\"[fn-85-P8538_2402167:288-nf] not Matter. And so, when it afterwards attains its perfection, it ceases to be accounted void, when God declares, \"Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed after its kind, and cording to its likeness, and the fruit-tree yielding fruit, whose seed is in itself, after its kind.\"[fn-85-P8539_2402479:289-nf] Again: \"Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth, after their kind.\"[fn-85-P8540_2402638:290-nf] Thus the divine Scripture accomplished its full order. For to that, which it had at first described as \"without form (invisible) and void,\" it gave both visibility and completion. Now no other Matter was \"without form (invisible) and void.\" Henceforth, then, Matter will have to be visible and complete. So that I must[fn-85-P8541_2402974:291-nf] see Matter, since it has become visible. I must likewise recognize it as a completed thing, so as to be able to gather from it the herb bearing seed, and the tree yielding fruit, and that living creatures, made out of it, may minister to my need. Matter, however, is nowhere,[fn-85-P8542_2403263:292-nf] but the Earth is here, confessed to my view. I see it, I enjoy it, ever since it ceased to be \"without form (invisible), and void.\" Concerning it most certainly did Isaiah speak when he said, \"Thus saith the Lord that created the heavens, He was the God that formed the earth, and made it.\"[fn-85-P8543_2403620:293-nf] The same earth for certain did He form, which He also made. Now how did He form[fn-85-P8544_2403721:294-nf] it? Of course by saying, \"Let the dry land appear.\"[fn-85-P8545_2403876:295-nf] Why does He command it to appear, if it were not previously invisible? His purpose was also, that He might thus prevent His having made it in vain, by rendering it visible, and so fit for use. And thus, throughout, proofs arise to us that this earth which we inhabit is the very same which was both created and formed[fn-85-P8546_2404212:296-nf] by God, and that none other was \"Without form, and void,\" than that which had been created and formed. It therefore follows that the sentence, \"Now the earth was without form, and void,\" applies to that same earth which God mentioned separately along with the heaven.[fn-85-P8547_2404532:297-nf] ","title":"Against Hermogenes.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":24,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_31_on_virginity","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"38","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But we need no lodger show in this narrow way the drawback of this life, as if the number of its ills was limited to adulteries, dissensions, and plots. I think we should take the higher and truer view, and say at once that none of that evil in life, which is visible in all its business and in all its pursuits, can have any hold over a man, if he will not put himself in the fetters of this course. The truth of what we say will be clear thus. A man who, seeing through the illusion with the eye of his spirit purged, lifts himself above the struggling world, and, to use the words of the Apostle, slights it all as but dung, in a way exiling himself altogether from human life by his abstinence from marriage,-that man has no fellowship whatever with the sins of mankind, such as avarice, envy, anger, hatred, and everything of the kind. He has an exemption from all this, and is in every way free and at peace; there is nothing in him to provoke his neighbours' envy, because he clutches none of those objects round which envy in this life gathers. He has raised his own life above the world, and prizing virtue as his only precious possession he will pass his days in painless peace and quiet. For virtue is a possession which, though all according to their capacity should share it, yet will be always in abundance for those who thirst after it; unlike the occupation of the lands on this earth, which men divide into sections, and the more they add to the one the more they take from the other, so that the one person's gain is his fellow's loss; whence arise the fights for the lion's share, from men's hatred of being cheated. But the larger owner of this possession is never envied; he who snatches the lion's share does no damage to him who claims equal participation; as each is capable each has this noble longing satisfied, while the wealth of virtues in those who are already occupiers[fn-26-P2676_1829327:17-nf] is not exhausted. The man, then, who, with his eyes only on such a life, makes virtue, which has no limit that man can devise, his only treasure, will surely never brook to bend his soul to any of those low courses which multitudes tread. He will not admire earthly riches, or human power, or any of those things which folly seeks. If, indeed, his mind is still pitched so low, he is outside our band of novices, and our words do not apply to him. But if his thoughts are above, walking as it were with God, he will be lifted out of the maze of all these errors; for the predisposing cause of them all, marriage, has not touched him. Now the wish to be before others is the deadly sin of pride, and one would not be far wrong in saying that this is the seed-root of all the thorns of sin; but it is from reasons connected with marriage that this pride mostly begins. To show what I mean, we generally find the grasping man throwing the blame on his nearest kin; the man mad after notoriety and ambition generally makes his family responsible for this sin: \"he must not be thought inferior to his forefathers; he must be deemed a great man by the generation to come by leaving his children historic records of himself\": so also the other maladies of the soul, envy, spite, hatred and such-like, are connected with this cause; they are to be found amongst those who are eager about the things of this life. He who has fled from it gazes as from some high watch-tower on the prospect of humanity, and pities these slaves of vanity for their blindness in setting such a value on bodily well-being. He sees some distinguished person giving himself airs because of his public honours, and wealth, and power, and only laughs at the folly of being so puffed up. He gives to the years of human life the longest number, according to the Psalmist's computation, and then compares this atom-interval with the endless ages, and pities the vain glory of those who excite themselves for such low and petty and perishable things. What, indeed, amongst the things here is there enviable in that which so many strive for,-honour? What is gained by those who win it? The mortal remains mortal whether he is honoured or not. What good does the possessor of many acres gain in the end? Except that the foolish man thinks his own that which never belongs to him, ignorant seemingly in his greed that \"the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof[fn-26-P2677_1831903:18-nf] ,\" for \"God is king of all the earth[fn-26-P2678_1831972:19-nf] .\" It is the passion of having which gives men a false title of lordship over that which can never belong to them. \"The earth,\" says the wise Preacher, \"abideth for ever[fn-26-P2679_1832174:20-nf] ,\" ministering to every generation, first one, then another, that is born upon it; but men, though they are so little even their own masters, that they are brought into life without knowing it by their Maker's will, and before they wish are withdrawn from it, nevertheless in their excessive vanity think that they are her lords; that they, now born, now dying, rule that which remains continually. One who reflecting on this holds cheaply all that mankind prizes, whose only love is the divine life, because \"all flesh is grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass[fn-26-P2680_1832771:21-nf] ,\" can never care for this grass which \"to-day is and to-morrow is not\"; studying the divine ways, he knows not only that human life has no fixity, but that the entire universe will not keep on its quiet course for ever; he neglects his existence here as an alien and a passing thing; for the Saviour said, \"Heaven and earth shall pass away[fn-26-P2681_1833131:22-nf] ,\" the whole of necessity awaits its refashioning. As long as he is \"in this tabernacle[fn-26-P2682_1833243:23-nf] .\" exhibiting mortality, weighed down with this existence, he laments the lengthening of his sojourn in it; as the Psalmist-poet says in his heavenly songs. Truly, they live in darkness who sojourn in these living tabernacles; wherefore that preacher, groaning at the continuance of this sojourn, says, \"Woe is me that my sojourn is prolonged[fn-26-P2683_1833604:24-nf] ,\" and he attributes the cause of his dejection to \"darkness\"; for we know that darkness is called in the Hebrew language \"kedar.\" It is indeed a darkness as of the night which envelops mankind, and prevents them seeing this deceit and knowing that all which is most prized by the living, and moreover all which is the reverse, exists only in the conception of the unreflecting, and is in itself nothing; there is no such reality anywhere as obscurity of birth, or illustrious birth, or glory, or splendour, or ancient renown, or present elevation, or power over others, or subjection. Wealth and comfort, poverty and distress, and all the other inequalities of life, seem to the ignorant, applying the test of pleasure, vastly different from each other. But to the higher understanding they are all alike; one is not of greater value than the other; because life runs on to the finish with the same speed through all these opposites, and in the lots of either class there remains the same power of choice to live well or ill, \"through armour on the right hand and on the left, through evil report and good report[fn-26-P2684_1834749:25-nf] .\" Therefore the clearseeing mind which measures reality will journey on its path without turning, accomplishing its appointed time from its birth to its exit; it is neither softened by the pleasures nor beaten down by the hardships; but, as is the way with travellers, it keeps advancing always, and takes but little notice of the views presented. It is the travellers way to press on to their journey's end, no matter whether they are passing through meadows and cultivated farms, or through wilder and more rugged spots; a smiling landscape does not detain them; nor a gloomy one check their speed. So, too, that lofty mind will press straight on to its self-imposed end, not turning aside to see anything on the way. It passes through life, but its gaze is fixed on heaven; it is the good steersman directing the bark to some landmark there. But the grosser mind looks down; it bends its energies to bodily pleasures as surely as the sheep stoop to their pasture; it lives for gorging and still lower pleasures[fn-26-P2685_1835784:26-nf] ; it is alienated from the life of God[fn-26-P2686_1836001:27-nf] , and a stranger to the promise of the Covenants; it recognizes no good but the gratification of the body. It is a mind such as this that \"walks in darkness[fn-26-P2687_1836188:28-nf] ,\" and invents all the evil in this life of ours; avarice, passions unchecked, unbounded luxury, lust of power, vain-glory, the whole mob of moral diseases that invade men's homes. In these vices, one somehow holds closely to another; where one has entered all the rest seem to follow, dragging each other in a natural order, just as in a chain, when you have jerked the first link, the others cannot rest, and even the link at the other end feels the motion of the first, which passes thence by virtue of their contiguity through the intervening links; so firmly are men's vices linked together by their very nature; when one of them has gained the mastery of a soul, the rest of the train follow. If you want a graphic picture of this accursed chain, suppose a man who because of some special pleasure it gives him is a victim to his thirst for fame; then a desire to increase his fortune follows close upon this thirst for fame; he becomes grasping; but only because the first vice leads him on to this. Then this grasping after money and superiority engenders either anger with his kith and kin, or pride towards his inferiors, or envy of those above him; then hypocrisy comes in after this envy; a soured temper after that; a misanthropical spirit after that; and behind them all a state of condemnation which ends in the dark fires of hell. You see the chain; how all follows from one cherished passion. Seeing, then, that this inseparable train of moral diseases has entered once for all into the world, one single way of escape is pointed out to us in the exhortations of the inspired writings; and that is to separate ourselves from the life which involves this sequence of sufferings. If we haunt Sodom, we cannot escape the rain of fire; nor if one who has fled out of her looks back upon her desolation, can he fail to become a pillar of salt rooted to the spot. We cannot be rid of the Egyptian bondage, unless we leave Egypt, that is, this life that lies under water[fn-26-P2688_1838191:29-nf] , and pass, not that Red Sea, but this black and gloomy Sea of life. But suppose we remain in this evil bondage, and, to use the Master's words, \"the truth shall not have made us free,\" how can one who seeks a lie and wanders in the maze of this world ever come to the truth? How can one who has surrendered his existence to be chained by nature run away from this captivity? An illustration will make our meaning clearer. A winter torrent[fn-26-P2689_1838684:30-nf] , which, impetuous in itself, becomes swollen and carries down beneath its stream trees and boulders and anything that comes in its way, is death and danger to those alone who live along its course; for those who have got well out of its way it rages in vain. Just so, only the man who lives in the turmoil of life has to feel its force; only he has to receive those sufferings which nature's stream, descending in a flood of troubles, must, to be true to its kind, bring to those who journey on its banks. But if a man leaves this torrent, and these \"proud waters[fn-26-P2690_1839268:31-nf] ,\" he will escape from being \"a prey to the teeth\" of this life, as the Psalm goes on to say, and, as \"a bird from the snare,\" on virtue's wings. This simile, then, of the torrent holds; human life is a tossing and tumultuous stream sweeping down to find its natural level; none of the objects sought for in it last till the seekers are satisfied; all that is carried to them by this stream comes near, just touches them, and passes on; so that the present moment in this impetuous flow eludes enjoyment, for the after-current snatches it from their view. It would be our interest therefore to keep far away from such a stream, lest, engaged on temporal things, we should neglect eternity. How can a man keep for ever anything here, be his love for it never so passionate? Which of life's most cherished objects endures always? What flower of prime? What gift of strength and beauty? What wealth, or fame, or power? They all have their transient bloom, and then melt away into their opposites. Who can continue in life's prime? Whose strength lasts for ever? Has not Nature made the bloom of beauty even more shortlived than the shows of spring? For they blossom in their season, and after withering for a while again revive; after another shedding they are again in leaf, and retain their beauty of to-day to a late prime. But Nature exhibits the human bloom only in the spring of early life; then she kills it; it is vanished in the frosts of age. All other delights also deceive the bodily eye for a time, and then pass behind the veil of oblivion. Nature's inevitable changes are many; they agonize him whose love is passionate. One way of escape is open: it is, to be attached to none of these things, and to get as far away as possible from the society of this emotional and sensual world; or rather, for a man to go outside the feelings which his own body gives rise to. Then, as he does not live for the flesh, he will not be subject to the troubles of the flesh. But this amounts to living for the spirit only, and imitating all we can the employment of the world of spirits. There they neither marry, nor are given in marriage. Their work and their excellence is to contemplate the Father of all purity, and to beautify the lines of their own character from the Source of all beauty, so far as imitation of It is possible.","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":24,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_31_on_virginity","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"38","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But we need no lodger show in this narrow way the drawback of this life, as if the number of its ills was limited to adulteries, dissensions, and plots.

To show what I mean, we generally find the grasping man throwing the blame on his nearest kin; the man mad after notoriety and ambition generally makes his family responsible for this sin: \"he must not be thought inferior to his forefathers; he must be deemed a great man by the generation to come by leaving his children historic records of himself\": so also the other maladies of the soul, envy, spite, hatred and such-like, are connected with this cause; they are to be found amongst those who are eager about the things of this life. He who has fled from it gazes as from some high watch-tower on the prospect of humanity, and pities these slaves of vanity for their blindness in setting such a value on bodily well-being. He sees some distinguished person giving himself airs because of his public honours, and wealth, and power, and only laughs at the folly of being so puffed up. He gives to the years of human life the longest number, according to the Psalmist's computation, and then compares this atom-interval with the endless ages, and pities the vain glory of those who excite themselves for such low and petty and perishable things. What, indeed, amongst the things here is there enviable in that which so many strive for,-honour? What is gained by those who win it? The mortal remains mortal whether he is honoured or not. What good does the possessor of many acres gain in the end? Except that the foolish man thinks his own that which never belongs to him, ignorant seemingly in his greed that \"the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof[fn-26-P2677_1831903:18-nf] ,\" for \"God is king of all the earth[fn-26-P2678_1831972:19-nf] .\" It is the passion of having which gives men a false title of lordship over that which can never belong to them. \"The earth,\" says the wise Preacher, \"abideth for ever[fn-26-P2679_1832174:20-nf] ,\" ministering to every generation, first one, then another, that is born upon it; but men, though they are so little even their own masters, that they are brought into life without knowing it by their Maker's will, and before they wish are withdrawn from it, nevertheless in their excessive vanity think that they are her lords; that they, now born, now dying, rule that which remains continually. One who reflecting on this holds cheaply all that mankind prizes, whose only love is the divine life, because \"all flesh is grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass[fn-26-P2680_1832771:21-nf] ,\" can never care for this grass which \"to-day is and to-morrow is not\"; studying the divine ways, he knows not only that human life has no fixity, but that the entire universe will not keep on its quiet course for ever; he neglects his existence here as an alien and a passing thing; for the Saviour said, \"Heaven and earth shall pass away[fn-26-P2681_1833131:22-nf] ,\" the whole of necessity awaits its refashioning. As long as he is \"in this tabernacle[fn-26-P2682_1833243:23-nf] .\" exhibiting mortality, weighed down with this existence, he laments the lengthening of his sojourn in it; as the Psalmist-poet says in his heavenly songs. Truly, they live in darkness who sojourn in these living tabernacles; wherefore that preacher, groaning at the continuance of this sojourn, says, \"Woe is me that my sojourn is prolonged[fn-26-P2683_1833604:24-nf] ,\" and he attributes the cause of his dejection to \"darkness\"; for we know that darkness is called in the Hebrew language \"kedar.\" It is indeed a darkness as of the night which envelops mankind, and prevents them seeing this deceit and knowing that all which is most prized by the living, and moreover all which is the reverse, exists only in the conception of the unreflecting, and is in itself nothing; there is no such reality anywhere as obscurity of birth, or illustrious birth, or glory, or splendour, or ancient renown, or present elevation, or power over others, or subjection. Wealth and comfort, poverty and distress, and all the other inequalities of life, seem to the ignorant, applying the test of pleasure, vastly different from each other. But to the higher understanding they are all alike; one is not of greater value than the other; because life runs on to the finish with the same speed through all these opposites, and in the lots of either class there remains the same power of choice to live well or ill, \"through armour on the right hand and on the left, through evil report and good report[fn-26-P2684_1834749:25-nf] .\" Therefore the clearseeing mind which measures reality will journey on its path without turning, accomplishing its appointed time from its birth to its exit; it is neither softened by the pleasures nor beaten down by the hardships; but, as is the way with travellers, it keeps advancing always, and takes but little notice of the views presented. It is the travellers way to press on to their journey's end, no matter whether they are passing through meadows and cultivated farms, or through wilder and more rugged spots; a smiling landscape does not detain them; nor a gloomy one check their speed. So, too, that lofty mind will press straight on to its self-imposed end, not turning aside to see anything on the way. It passes through life, but its gaze is fixed on heaven; it is the good steersman directing the bark to some landmark there. But the grosser mind looks down; it bends its energies to bodily pleasures as surely as the sheep stoop to their pasture; it lives for gorging and still lower pleasures[fn-26-P2685_1835784:26-nf] ; it is alienated from the life of God[fn-26-P2686_1836001:27-nf] , and a stranger to the promise of the Covenants; it recognizes no good but the gratification of the body. It is a mind such as this that \"walks in darkness[fn-26-P2687_1836188:28-nf] ,\" and invents all the evil in this life of ours; avarice, passions unchecked, unbounded luxury, lust of power, vain-glory, the whole mob of moral diseases that invade men's homes. In these vices, one somehow holds closely to another; where one has entered all the rest seem to follow, dragging each other in a natural order, just as in a chain, when you have jerked the first link, the others cannot rest, and even the link at the other end feels the motion of the first, which passes thence by virtue of their contiguity through the intervening links; so firmly are men's vices linked together by their very nature; when one of them has gained the mastery of a soul, the rest of the train follow. If you want a graphic picture of this accursed chain, suppose a man who because of some special pleasure it gives him is a victim to his thirst for fame; then a desire to increase his fortune follows close upon this thirst for fame; he becomes grasping; but only because the first vice leads him on to this. Then this grasping after money and superiority engenders either anger with his kith and kin, or pride towards his inferiors, or envy of those above him; then hypocrisy comes in after this envy; a soured temper after that; a misanthropical spirit after that; and behind them all a state of condemnation which ends in the dark fires of hell. You see the chain; how all follows from one cherished passion. Seeing, then, that this inseparable train of moral diseases has entered once for all into the world, one single way of escape is pointed out to us in the exhortations of the inspired writings; and that is to separate ourselves from the life which involves this sequence of sufferings. If we haunt Sodom, we cannot escape the rain of fire; nor if one who has fled out of her looks back upon her desolation, can he fail to become a pillar of salt rooted to the spot. We cannot be rid of the Egyptian bondage, unless we leave Egypt, that is, this life that lies under water[fn-26-P2688_1838191:29-nf] , and pass, not that Red Sea, but this black and gloomy Sea of life. But suppose we remain in this evil bondage, and, to use the Master's words, \"the truth shall not have made us free,\" how can one who seeks a lie and wanders in the maze of this world ever come to the truth? How can one who has surrendered his existence to be chained by nature run away from this captivity? An illustration will make our meaning clearer. A winter torrent[fn-26-P2689_1838684:30-nf] , which, impetuous in itself, becomes swollen and carries down beneath its stream trees and boulders and anything that comes in its way, is death and danger to those alone who live along its course; for those who have got well out of its way it rages in vain. Just so, only the man who lives in the turmoil of life has to feel its force; only he has to receive those sufferings which nature's stream, descending in a flood of troubles, must, to be true to its kind, bring to those who journey on its banks. But if a man leaves this torrent, and these \"proud waters[fn-26-P2690_1839268:31-nf] ,\" he will escape from being \"a prey to the teeth\" of this life, as the Psalm goes on to say, and, as \"a bird from the snare,\" on virtue's wings. This simile, then, of the torrent holds; human life is a tossing and tumultuous stream sweeping down to find its natural level; none of the objects sought for in it last till the seekers are satisfied; all that is carried to them by this stream comes near, just touches them, and passes on; so that the present moment in this impetuous flow eludes enjoyment, for the after-current snatches it from their view. It would be our interest therefore to keep far away from such a stream, lest, engaged on temporal things, we should neglect eternity. How can a man keep for ever anything here, be his love for it never so passionate? Which of life's most cherished objects endures always? What flower of prime? What gift of strength and beauty? What wealth, or fame, or power? They all have their transient bloom, and then melt away into their opposites. Who can continue in life's prime? Whose strength lasts for ever? Has not Nature made the bloom of beauty even more shortlived than the shows of spring? For they blossom in their season, and after withering for a while again revive; after another shedding they are again in leaf, and retain their beauty of to-day to a late prime. But Nature exhibits the human bloom only in the spring of early life; then she kills it; it is vanished in the frosts of age. All other delights also deceive the bodily eye for a time, and then pass behind the veil of oblivion. Nature's inevitable changes are many; they agonize him whose love is passionate. One way of escape is open: it is, to be attached to none of these things, and to get as far away as possible from the society of this emotional and sensual world; or rather, for a man to go outside the feelings which his own body gives rise to. Then, as he does not live for the flesh, he will not be subject to the troubles of the flesh. But this amounts to living for the spirit only, and imitating all we can the employment of the world of spirits. There they neither marry, nor are given in marriage. Their work and their excellence is to contemplate the Father of all purity, and to beautify the lines of their own character from the Source of all beauty, so far as imitation of It is possible.","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":24,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_31_on_virginity","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"38","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But we need no lodger show in this narrow way the drawback of this life, as if the number of its ills was limited to adulteries, dissensions, and plots. I think we should take the higher and truer view, and say at once that none of that evil in life, which is visible in all its business and in all its pursuits, can have any hold over a man, if he will not put himself in the fetters of this course. The truth of what we say will be clear thus. A man who, seeing through the illusion with the eye of his spirit purged, lifts himself above the struggling world, and, to use the words of the Apostle, slights it all as but dung, in a way exiling himself altogether from human life by his abstinence from marriage,-that man has no fellowship whatever with the sins of mankind, such as avarice, envy, anger, hatred, and everything of the kind. He has an exemption from all this, and is in every way free and at peace; there is nothing in him to provoke his neighbours' envy, because he clutches none of those objects round which envy in this life gathers. He has raised his own life above the world, and prizing virtue as his only precious possession he will pass his days in painless peace and quiet. For virtue is a possession which, though all according to their capacity should share it, yet will be always in abundance for those who thirst after it; unlike the occupation of the lands on this earth, which men divide into sections, and the more they add to the one the more they take from the other, so that the one person's gain is his fellow's loss; whence arise the fights for the lion's share, from men's hatred of being cheated. But the larger owner of this possession is never envied; he who snatches the lion's share does no damage to him who claims equal participation; as each is capable each has this noble longing satisfied, while the wealth of virtues in those who are already occupiers[fn-26-P2676_1829327:17-nf] is not exhausted. The man, then, who, with his eyes only on such a life, makes virtue, which has no limit that man can devise, his only treasure, will surely never brook to bend his soul to any of those low courses which multitudes tread. He will not admire earthly riches, or human power, or any of those things which folly seeks. If, indeed, his mind is still pitched so low, he is outside our band of novices, and our words do not apply to him. But if his thoughts are above, walking as it were with God, he will be lifted out of the maze of all these errors; for the predisposing cause of them all, marriage, has not touched him.

The master of a private dwelling will not allow any untidiness or unseemliness to be seen in the house, such as a couch upset, or the table littered with rubbish, or vessels of price thrown away into dirty corners, while those which serve ignobler uses are thrust forward for entering guests to see. He has everything arranged neatly and in the proper place, where it stands to most advantage; and then he can welcome his guests, without any misgivings that he need be ashamed of opening the interior of his house to receive them. The same duty, I take it, is incumbent on that master of our \"tabernacle,\" the mind; it has to arrange everything within us, and to put each particular faculty of the soul, which the Creator has fashioned to be our implement or our vessel, to fitting and noble uses. We will now mention in detail the way in which any one might manage his life, with its present advantages, to his improvement, hoping that no one will accuse us of trifling[fn-28-P2818_1909802:117-nf] , or over-minuteness. We advise, then, that love's passion be placed in the soul's purest shrine, as a thing chosen to be the first fruits of all our gifts, and devoted[fn-28-P2819_1910017:118-nf] entirely to God; and when once this has been done, to keep it untouched and unsullied by any secular defilement. Then indignation, and anger, and hatred must be as watch-dogs to be roused only against attacking sins; they must follow their natural impulse only against the thief and the enemy who is creeping in to plunder the divine treasure-chamber, and who comes only for that, that he may steal, and mangle, and destroy. Courage and confidence are to be weapons in our hands to baffle any sudden surprise and attack of the wicked who advance. Hope and patience are to be the staffs to lean upon, whenever we are weary with the trials of the world. As for sorrow, we must have a stock of it ready to apply, if need should happen to arise for it, in the hour of repentance for our sins; believing at the same time that it is never useful, except to minister to that. Righteousness will be our rule of straightforwardness, guarding us from stumbling either in word or deed, and guiding us in the disposal of the faculties of our soul, as well as in the due consideration for every one we meet. The love of gain, which is a large, incalculably large, element in every soul, when once applied to the desire for God, will bless the man who has it; for he will be violent[fn-28-P2820_1911376:119-nf] where it is right to be violent. Wisdom and prudence will be our advisers as to our best interests; they will order our lives so as never to suffer from any thoughtless folly. But suppose a man does not apply the aforesaid faculties of the soul to their proper use, but reverses their intended purpose; suppose he wastes his love upon the basest objects, and stores up his hatred only for his own kinsmen; suppose he welcomes iniquity, plays the man only against his parents, is bold only in absurdities, fixes his hopes on emptiness, chases prudence and wisdom from his company, takes gluttony and folly for his mistresses, and uses all his other opportunities in the same fashion, he would indeed be a strange and unnatural character to a degree beyond any one's power to express. If we could imagine any one putting his armour on all the wrong way, reversing the helmet so as to cover his face while the plume nodded backward, putting his feet into the cuirass, and fitting the greaves on to his breast, changing to the right side all that ought to go on the left and vice versa, and how such a hoplite would be likely to fare in battle, then we should have an idea of the fate in life which is sure to await him whose confused judgment makes him reverse the proper uses of his soul's faculties. We must therefore provide this balance in all feeling; the true sobriety of mind is naturally able to supply it; and if one had to find an exact definition of this sobriety, one might declare absolutely, that it amounts to our ordered control, by dint of wisdom and prudence, over every emotion of the soul. Moreover, such a condition in the soul will be no longer in need of any laborious method to attain to the high and heavenly realities; it will accomplish with the greatest ease that which erewhile seemed so unattainable; it will grasp the object of its search as a natural consequence of rejecting the opposite attractions. A man who comes out of darkness is necessarily in the light; a man who is not dead is necessarily alive. Indeed, if a man is not to have received his soul to no purpose[fn-28-P2821_1913528:120-nf] , he will certainly be upon the path of truth; the prudence and the science employed to guard against error will be itself a sure guidance along the right road. Slaves who have been freed and cease to serve their former masters, the very moment they become their own masters, direct all their thoughts towards themselves so, I take it, the soul which has been freed from ministering to the body becomes at once cognizant of its own inherent energy. But this liberty consists, as we learn from the Apostle[fn-28-P2822_1914149:121-nf] , in not again being held in the yoke of slavery, and in not being bound again, like a runaway or a criminal, with the fetters of marriage. But I must return here to what I said at first; that the perfection of this liberty does not consist only in that one point of abstaining from marriage. Let no one suppose that the prize of virginity is so insignificant and so easily won as that; as if one little observance of the flesh could settle so vital a matter. But we have seen that every man who doeth a sin is the servant of sin[fn-28-P2823_1914697:122-nf] ; so that a declension towards vice in any act, or in any practice whatever, makes a slave, and still more, a branded slave, of the man, covering him through sin's lashes with bruises and seared spots. Therefore it behoves the man who grasps at the transcendent aim of all virginity to be true to himself in h every respect, and to manifest his purity equally in every relation of his life. If any of the inspired words are required to aid our pleading, the Truth[fn-28-P2824_1915186:123-nf] Itself will be sufficient to corroborate the truth when It inculcates this very kind of teaching in the veiled meaning of a Gospel Parable: the good and eatable fish are separated by the fishers' skill from the bad and poisonous fish, so that the enjoyment of the good should not be spoilt by any of the bad getting into the \"vessels\" with them. The work of true sobriety is the same; from all pursuits and habits to choose that which is pure and improving, rejecting in every case that which does not seem likely to be useful, and letting it go back into the universal and secular life, called \"the sea[fn-28-P2825_1915813:124-nf] ,\" in the imagery of the Parable. The Psalmist[fn-28-P2826_1915902:125-nf] also, when expounding the doctrine of a full confession[fn-28-P2827_1915978:126-nf] , calls this restless suffering tumultuous life, \"waters coming in even unto the soul,\" \"depths of waters,\" and a \"hurricane\"; in which sea indeed every rebellious thought sinks, as the Egyptian did, with a stone's weight into the deeps[fn-28-P2828_1916261:127-nf] . But all in us that is dear to God, and has a piercing insight into the truth (called \"Israel\" in the narrative), passes, but that alone, over that sea as if it were dry land, and is never reached by the bitterness and the brine of life's billows. Thus, typically, under the leadership of the Law (for Moses was a type of the Law that was coming) Israel passes unwetted over that sea, while the Egyptian who crosses in her track is overwhelmed. Each fares according to the disposition which he carries with him; one walks lightly enough, the other is dragged into the deep water. For virtue is a light and buoyant thing, and all who live in her way \"fly like clouds[fn-28-P2829_1916948:128-nf] ,\" as Isaiah says, \"and as doves with their young ones\"; but sin is a heavy affair, \"sitting,\" as another of the prophets says, \"upon a talent of lead[fn-28-P2830_1917155:129-nf] .\" If, however, this reading of the history appears to any forced and inapplicable, and the miracle at the Red Sea does not present itself to him as written for our profit, let him listen to the Apostle: \"Now all these things happened unto them for types, and they are written for our admonition[fn-28-P2831_1917684:130-nf] .\"","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":24,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_33_oration_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"78","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"74.

Doubtless, when the souls have departed from their bodies, and begun to be put upon trial in the several stories of the heavens, with reference to the engagement (under which they have come to Jesus), and to be questioned about those hidden mysteries of the heretics, they must then confess before the real powers and the real men,-the Teleti,[fn-110-P11049_3129035:60-nf] to wit, and the Abascanti,[fn-110-P11050_3129080:61-nf] and the Acineti[fn-110-P11051_3129122:62-nf] of Valentinus! For, say they, even the Demiurge himself did not uniformly approve of the men of our world, whom he counted as a drop of a bucket,[fn-110-P11052_3129289:63-nf] and the dust of the threshing-floor, and spittle and locusts, and put on a level even with brute beasts. Clearly, it is so written. Yet not therefore must we understand that there is, besides us, another kind of man, which-for it is evidently thus (in the case proposed)-has been able to assume without invalidating a comparison between the two kinds, both the characteristics of the race and a unique property. For even if the life was tainted, so that condemned to contempt it might be likened to objects held in contempt, the nature was not forthwith taken away, so that there might be supposed to be another under its name. Rather is the nature preserved, though the life blushes; nor does Christ know other men than those with reference to whom He says, \"Whom do men say that I am? \"[fn-110-P11053_3130096:64-nf] And, \"As ye would that men should do to you, do ye likewise so to, them.\"[fn-110-P11054_3130190:65-nf] Consider whether He may not have I preserved a race such that He is looking for a testimony to Himself from them, as well as l consisting of those on whom He enjoins the interchange of righteous dealing. But if I should urgently demand that those heavenly men be described to me, Aratus will sketch more easily Perseus and Cepheus, and Erigone, and Ariadne, among the constellations. But who prevented the Lord from clearly prescribing that confession by men likewise has to be made where He plainly announced that His own would be; so that the statement might have run thus: \"Whosoever shall confess in me before men in heaven, I also will confess in him before my Father who is in heaven? \"He ought to have saved me from this mistake about confession on earth, which He would not have wished me to take part in, if He had commanded one in heaven; for I knew no other men but the inhabitants of the earth, man himself even not having up to that time been observed in heaven. Besides, what is the credibility of the things (alleged), that, being after death raised to heavenly places, I should be put to the test there, whither I would not be translated without being already tested, that I should there be tried in reference to a command where I could not come, but to find admittance? Heaven lies open to the Christian before the way to it does; because there is no way to heaven, but to him to whom heaven lies open; and he who reaches it will enter. What powers, keeping guard at the gate, do I hear you affirm to exist in accordance with Roman superstition, with a certain Carnus, Forculus, and Limentinus? What powers do you set in order at the railings? If you have ever read in David, \"Lift up your gates, ye princes, and let the everlasting gates be lifted up; and the King of glory shall enter in; \"[fn-110-P11055_3132036:66-nf] if you have also heard from Amos, \"Who buildeth up to the heavens his way of ascent, and is such as to pour forth his abundance (of waters) over the earth; \"[fn-110-P11056_3132212:67-nf] know that both that way of ascent was thereafter levelled with the ground, by the footsteps of the Lord, and an entrance thereafter opened up by the might of Christ, and that no delay or inquest will meet Christians on the threshold, since they have there to be not discriminated from one another, but owned, and not put to the question, but received in. For though you think heaven still shut, remember that the Lord left here to Peter and through him to the Church, the keys of it, which every one who has been here put to the question, and also made confession, will carry with him. But the devil stoutly affirms that we must confess there, to persuade us that we must deny here. I shall send before me fine documents, to be sure,[fn-110-P11057_3132963:68-nf] I shall carry with me excellent keys, the fear of them who kill the body only, but do nought against the soul: I shall be graced by the neglect of this command: I shall stand with credit in heavenly places, who could not stand in earthly: I shall hold out against the greater powers, who yielded to the lesser: I shall deserve to be at length let in, though now shut out. It readily occurs to one to remark further, \"If it is in heaven that men must confess, it is here too that they must deny.\" For where the one is, there both are. For contraries always go together. There will need to be carried on in heaven persecution even, which is the occasion of confession or denial. Why, then, do you refrain, O most presumptuous heretic, from transporting to the world above the whole series of means proper to the intimidation of Christians, and especially to put there the very hatred for the name, where Christ rules at the right hand of the Father? Will you plant there both synagogues of the Jews-fountains of persecution-before which the apostles endured the scourge, and heathen assemblages with their own circus, forsooth, where they readily join in the cry, Death to the third race?[fn-110-P11058_3134179:69-nf] But ye are bound to produce in the same place both our brothers, fathers, children, mothers-in-law, daughters-in-law and those of our household, through whose agency the betrayal has been appointed; likewise kings, governors, and armed authorities, before whom the matter at issue must be contested. Assuredly there will be in heaven a prison also, destitute of the sun's rays or full of light unthankfully, and fetters of the zones perhaps, and, for a rack-horse, the axis itself which whirls the heavens round. Then, if a Christian is to be stoned, hail-storms will be near; if burned, thunderbolts are at hand; if butchered, the armed Orion will exercise his function; if put an end to by beasts, the north will send forth the bears, the Zodiac the bulls and the lions. He who will endure these assaults to the end, the same shall be saved. Will there be then, in heaven, both an end, and suffering, a killing, and the first confession? And where will be the flesh requisite for all this? Where the body which alone has to be killed by men? Unerring reason has commanded us to set forth these things in even a playful manner; nor will any one thrust out the bar consisting in this objection (we have offered), so as not to be compelled to transfer the whole array of means proper to persecution, all the powerful instrumentality which has been provided for dealing with this matter, to the place where he has put the court before which confession should be made. Since confession is elicited by persecution, and persecution ended in confession, there cannot but be at the same time, in attendance upon these, the instrumentality which determines both the entrance and the exit, that is, the beginning and the end. But both hatred for the name will be here, persecution breaks out here, betrayal brings men forth here, examination uses force here, torture rages here, and confession or denial completes this whole course of procedure on the earth. Therefore, if the other things are here, confession also is not elsewhere; if confession is elsewhere, the other things also are not here. Certainly the other things are not elsewhere; therefore neither is confession in heaven. Or, if they will have it that the manner in which the heavenly examination and confession take place is different, it will certainly be also incumbent on them to devise a mode of procedure of their own of a very different kind, and opposed to that method which is indicated in the Scriptures. And we may be able to say, Let them consider (whether what they imagine to exist does so), if so be that this course of procedure, proper to examination and confession on earth-a course which has persecution as the source in which it originates, and which pleads dissension in the state-is preserved to its own faith, if so be that we must believe just as is also written, and understand just as is spoken. Here I endure the entire course (in question), the Lord Himself not appointing a different quarter of the world for my doing so. For what does He add after finishing with confession and denial? \"Think not that I am come to send peace on earth, but a sword,\"-undoubtedly on the earth. \"For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law. And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.\"[fn-110-P11059_3137697:70-nf] For so is it brought to pass, that the brother delivers up the brother to death, and the father the son: and the children rise up against the parents, and cause them to die. And he who endureth to the end let that man be saved.[fn-110-P11060_3137943:71-nf] So that this whole course of procedure characteristic of the Lord's sword, which has been sent not to heaven, but to earth, makes confession also to be there, which by enduring to the end is to issue in the suffering of death.","title":"Scorpiace.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":24,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_46_the_first_apology_of_justin","source_chapter":53,"source_paragraph":"176","folder":"ANF-01","text":"And that the Spirit of prophecy might signify to us that He who suffers these things has an ineffable origin, and rules His enemies, He spake thus: \"His generation who shall declare? because His life is cut off from the earth: for their transgressions He comes to death.

For every demon, when exorcised in the name of this very Son of God-who is the First-born of every creature, who became man by the Virgin, who suffered, and was crucified under Pontius Pilate by your nation, who died, who rose from the dead, and ascended into heaven-is overcome and subdued. But though you exorcise any demon in the name of any of those who were amongst you-either kings, or righteous men, or prophets, or patriarchs-it will not be subject to you.

How, then, could He talk with any one, or be seen by any one, or appear on the smallest portion of the earth, when the people at Sinai were not able to look even on the glory of Him who was sent from Him; and Moses himself could not enter into the tabernacle which he had erected, when it was filled with the glory of God; and the priest could not endure to stand before the temple when Solomon conveyed the ark into the house in Jerusalem which he had built for it?

For there are, in sooth, \"on the fruitful earth thrice ten thousand\" demons, not immortal, nor indeed mortal; for they are not endowed with sensation, so as to render them capable of death, but only things of wood and stone, that hold despotic sway over men insulting and violating life through the force of custom. \"The earth is the Lord's,\" it is said, \"and the fulness thereof.\"[fn-32-P3205_943378:137-nf] Then why darest thou, while luxuriating in the bounties of the Lord, to ignore the Sovereign Ruler? \"Leave my earth,\" the Lord will say to thee. \"Touch not the water which I bestow. Partake not of the fruits of the earth produced by my husbandry\" Give to God recompense for your sustenance; acknowledge thy Master. Thou art God's creature. What belongs to Him, how can it with justice be alienated? For that which is alienated, being deprived of the properties that belonged to it, is also deprived of truth. For, after the fashion of Niobe, or, to express myself more mystically, like the Hebrew woman called by the ancients Lot's wife, are ye not turned into a state of insensibility? This woman we have heard, was turned into stone for her love of Sodore. And those who are godless, addicted to impiety, hard-hearted and foolish are Sodomites. Believe that these utterances are addressed to you from God. For think not that stones, and stocks, and birds, and serpents are sacred things, and men are not; but, on the contrary, regard men as truly sacred,[fn-32-P3206_944473:138-nf] and take beasts and stones for what they are. For there are miserable wretches of human kind, who consider that God utters His voice by the raven and the jackdaw, but says nothing by man; and honour the raven as a messenger of God. But the man of God, who croaks not, nor chatters, but speaks rationally and instructs lovingly, alas, they persecute; and while he is inviting them to cultivate righteousness, they try inhumanly to slay him, neither welcoming the grace which, comes from above, nor fearing the penalty. For they believe not God, nor understand His power, whose love to man is ineffable; and His hatred of evil is inconceivable. His anger augments punishment against sin; His love bestows blessings on repentance. It is the height of wretchedness to be deprived of the help which comes from God. Hence this blindness of eyes and dulness of hearing are more grievous than other inflictions of the evil one; for the one deprives them of heavenly vision, the other robs them of divine instruction. But ye, thus maimed as respects the truth, blind in mind, deaf in understanding, are not grieved, are not pained, have had no desire to see heaven and the Maker of heaven, nor, by fixing your choice on salvation, have sought to hear the Creator of the universe, and to learn of Him; for no hindrance stands in the way of him who is bent on the knowledge of God. Neither childlessness, nor poverty, nor obscurity, nor want, can hinder him who eagerly strives after the knowledge of God; nor does any one who has conquered[fn-32-P3207_946125:139-nf] by brass or iron the true wisdom for himself choose to exchange it, for it is vastly preferred to everything else. Christ is able to save in every place. For he that is fired with ardour and admiration for righteousness, being the lover of One who needs nothing, needs himself but little, having treasured up his bliss in nothing but himself and God, where is neither moth,[fn-32-P3208_946659:140-nf] robber, nor pirate, but the eternal Giver of good. With justice, then, have you been compared to those serpents who shut their ears against the charmers. For \"their mind,\" says the Scripture, \"is like the serpent, like the deaf adder, which stoppeth her ear, and will not hear the voice of the charmers.\"[fn-32-P3209_946988:141-nf] But allow yourselves to feel the influence of the charming strains of sanctity, and receive that mild word of ours, and reject the deadly poison, that it may be granted to you to divest yourselves as much as possible of destruction, as they[fn-32-P3210_947371:142-nf] have been divested of old age. Hear me, and do not stop your ears; do not block up the avenues of hearing, but lay to heart what is said. Excellent is the medicine of immortality! Stop at length your grovelling reptile motions.[fn-32-P3211_947654:143-nf] \"For the enemies of the Lord,\" says Scripture, \"shall lick the dust.\"[fn-32-P3212_947866:144-nf] Raise your eyes from earth to the skies, look up to heaven, admire the sight, cease watching with outstretched head the heel of the righteous, and hindering the way of truth. Be wise and harmless. Perchance the Lord will endow you with the wing of simplicity (for He has resolved to give wings to those that are earth-born), that you may leave your holes and dwell in heaven. Only let us with our whole heart repent, that we may be able with our whole heart to contain God. \"Trust in Him, all ye assembled people; pour out all your hearts before Him.\"[fn-32-P3213_948438:145-nf] He says to those that have newly abandoned wickedness, \"He pities them, and fills them with righteousness.\" Believe Him who is man and God; believe, O man. Believe, O man, the living God, who suffered and is adored. Believe, ye slaves,[fn-32-P3214_948694:146-nf] Him who died; believe, all ye of human kind, Him who alone is God of all men. Believe, and receive salvation as your reward. Seek God, and your soul shall live. He who seeks God is busying himself about his own salvation. Hast thou found God?-then thou hast life. Let us then seek, in order that we may live. The reward of seeking is life with God. \"Let all who seek Thee be glad and rejoice in Thee; and let them say continually, God be magnified.\"[fn-32-P3215_949221:147-nf] A noble hymn of God is an immortal man, established in righteousness, in whom the oracles of truth are engraved. For where but in a soul that is wise can you write truth? where love? where reverence? where meekness? Those who have had these divine characters impressed on them, ought, I think, to regard wisdom as a fair port whence to embark, to whatever lot in life they turn; and likewise to deem it the calm haven of salvation: wisdom, by which those who have betaken themselves to the Father, have proved good fathers to their children; and good parents to their sons, those who have known the Son; and good husbands to their wives, those who remember the Bridegroom; and good masters to their servants,[fn-32-P3216_949950:148-nf] those who have been redeemed from utter slavery. Oh, happier far the beasts than men involved in error! who live in ignorance as you, but do not counterfeit the truth. There are no tribes of flatterers among them. Fishes have no superstition: the birds worship not a single image; only they look with admiration on heaven, since, deprived as they are of reason, they are unable to know God. So are you not ashamed for living through so many periods of life in impiety, making yourselves more irrational than irrational creatures? You were boys, then striplings, then youths, then men, but never as yet were you good. If you have respect for old age, be wise, now that you have reached life's sunset; and albeit at the close of life, acquire the knowledge of God, that the end of life may to you prove the beginning of salvation. You have become old in superstition; as young, enter on the practice of piety. God regards you as innocent children. Let, then, the Athenian follow the laws of Solon, and the Argive those of Phoroneus, and the Spartan those of Lycurgus: but if thou enrol thyself as one of God's people, heaven is thy country, God thy lawgiver. And what are the laws? \"Thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt not seduce boys; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness; thou shalt love the Lord thy God.\"[fn-32-P3217_951387:149-nf] And the complements of these are those laws. of reason and words of sanctity which are inscribed on men's hearts: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; to him who strikes thee on the cheek, present also the other; \"[fn-32-P3218_951643:150-nf] \"thou shalt not lust, for by lust alone thou hast committed adultery.\"[fn-32-P3219_951734:151-nf] How much better, therefore, is it for men from the beginning not to wish to desire things forbidden, than to obtain their desires! But ye are not able to endure the austerity of salvation; but as we delight in sweet' things, and prize them higher for the agreeableness of the pleasure they yield, while, on the other hand, those bitter things which are distasteful to the palate are curative and healing, and the harshness of medicines strengthens people of weak stomach, thus custom pleases and, tickles; but custom pushes into the abyss, while truth conducts to heaven. Harsh it is at first, but a good nurse of youth; and it is at once the decorous place where the household maids and matrons dwell together, and the sage council-chamber. Nor is it difficult to approach, or impossible to attain, but is very near us in our very homes; as Moses, endowed with all wisdom, says, while referring to it, it has its abode in three departments of our constitution-in the hands, the mouth, and the heart: a meet emblem this of truth, which is embraced by these three things in all-will, action, speech. And be not afraid lest the multitude of pleasing objects which rise before you withdraw you from wisdom. You yourself will spontaneously surmount the frivolousness of custom, as boys when they have become men throw aside their toys. For with a celerity unsurpassable, and a benevolence to which we have ready access, the divine power, casting its radiance on the earth, hath filled the universe with the seed of salvation. For it was not without divine care that so great a work was accomplished in so brief a space by the Lord, who, though despised as to appearance, was in reality adored, the expiator of sin, the Saviour, the clement, the Divine Word, He that is truly most manifest Deity, He that is made equal to the Lord of the universe; because He was His Son, and the Word was in God, not disbelieved in by all when He was first preached, nor altogether unknown when, assuming the character of man, and fashioning Himself in flesh, He enacted the drama of human salvation: for He was a true champion and a fellow-champion with the creature. And being communicated most speedily to men, having dawned from His Father's counsel quicker than the sun, with the most perfect ease He made God shine on us. Whence He was and what He was, He showed by what He taught and exhibited, manifesting Himself as the Herald of the Covenant, the Reconciler, our Saviour, the Word, the Fount of life, the Giver of peace, diffused over the whole face of the earth; by whom, so to speak, the universe has already become an ocean of blessings.[fn-32-P3220_954384:152-nf] ","title":"Exhortation to the Heathen","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":24,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_50_exhortation_to_the_heathen","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"380","folder":"ANF-02","text":"For what, think you, O men, is the Hermes of Typho, and that of Andocides, and that of Amyetus?

And if Strife and Battle be not gods, no more are ArÃªs and Enyo. Still further, if the lightnings, and thunderbolts, and rains are not gods, how can fire and water be gods? how can shooting stars and comets, which are produced by atmospheric changes? He who calls Fortune a god, let him also so call Action.

For to \"ascend,\" and to \"sit,\" and to \"come,\" unless you understand the words in accordance with the dignity of the divine nature, appear to point to something of human weakness. For having consummated what was to be done on earth, and having recalled souls from the captivity of hell, He is spoken of as ascending up to heaven, as the Prophet had foretold, \"Ascending up on high He led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men,\"[fn-98-P9814_2757299:121-nf] those gifts, namely, which Peter, in the Acts of the Apostles, spoke of concerning the Holy Ghost, \"Being therefore by the right hand of God exalted, He hath shed forth this gift which ye do see and hear.\"[fn-98-P9815_2757528:122-nf] He gave the gift of the Holy Ghost to men, because the captives, whom the devil had before carried into hell through sin, Christ by His resurrection from death recalled to heaven.

This is in accordance with what the Lord said to the man who had been healed: \"Behold, thou art made whole; sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.\"[fn-87-P8795_2500544:584-nf] For he who is good, and righteous, and pure, and spotless, will endure nothing evil, nor unjust, nor detestable in His wedding chamber. This is the Father of our Lord, by whose providence all things consist, and all are administered by His command; and He confers His free gifts upon those who should [receive them]; but the most righteous Retributor metes out [punishment] according to their deserts, most deservedly, to the ungrateful and to those that are insensible of His kindness; and therefore does He say, \"He sent His armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.\"[fn-87-P8796_2501156:585-nf] He says here, \"His armies,\" because all men are the property of God. For \"the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and all that dwell therein.\"[fn-87-P8797_2501342:586-nf] Wherefore also the Apostle Paul says in the Epistle to the Romans, \"For there is no power but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God; and they that resist shall receive unto themselves condemnation. For rulers are not for a terror to a good work, but to an evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same; for he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, the avenger for wrath upon him that doeth evil. Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake. For this cause pay ye tribute also; for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.\"[fn-87-P8798_2502210:587-nf] Both the Lord, then, and the apostles announce as the one only God the Father, Him who gave the law, who sent the prophets, who made all things; and therefore does, He say, \"He sent His armies,\" because every man, inasmuch as he is a man, is His workmanship, although he may be ignorant of his God. For He gives existence to all; He, \"who maketh His sun to rise upon the evil and the good, and sendeth rain upon the just and unjust.\"[fn-87-P8799_2502667:588-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":24,"verse":19,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_62_book_vii_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"109","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Celsus adds: \"Will they not besides make this reflection? If the prophets of the God of the Jews foretold that he who should come into the world would be the Son of this same God, how could he command them through Moses to gather wealth, to extend their dominion, to fill the earth, to put their enemies of every age to the sword, and to destroy them utterly, which indeed he himself did-as Moses says-threatening them, moreover, that if they did not obey his commands, he would treat them as his avowed enemies; whilst, on the other hand, his Son, the man of Nazareth, promulgated laws quite opposed to these, declaring that no one can come to the Father who loves power, or riches, or glory; that men ought not to be more careful in providing food than the ravens; that they were to be less concerned about their raiment than the lilies; that to him who has given them one blow, they should offer to receive another? Whether is it Moses or Jesus who teaches falsely? Did the Father, when he sent Jesus, forget the commands which he had given to Moses? Or did he change his mind, condemn his own laws, and send forth a messenger with counter instructions? \"Celsus, with all his boasts of universal knowledge, has here fallen into the most vulgar of errors, in supposing that in the law and the prophets there is not a meaning deeper than that afforded by a literal rendering of the words. He does not see how manifestly incredible it is that worldly riches should be promised to those who lead upright lives, when it is a matter of common observation that the best of men have lived in extreme poverty. Indeed, the prophets themselves, who for the purity of their lives received the Divine Spirit, \"wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented: they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.\"[fn-109-P10921_2934466:23-nf] For, as the Psalmist, says, \"many are the afflictions of the righteous.\"[fn-109-P10922_2934561:24-nf] If Celsus had read the writings of Moses, he would, I daresay, have supposed that when it is said to him who kept the law, \"Thou shalt lend unto many nations, and thou thyself shalt not borrow,\"[fn-109-P10923_2934775:25-nf] the promise is made to the just man, that his temporal riches should be so abundant, that he would be able to lend not only to the Jews, not only to two or three nations, but \"to many nations.\" What, then, must have been the wealth which the just man received according to the law for his righteousness, if he could lend to many nations? And must we not suppose also, in accordance with this interpretation, that the just man would never borrow anything? For it is written, \"and thou shalt thyself borrow nothing.\" Did then that nation remain for so long a period attached to the religion which was taught by Moses, whilst, according to the supposition of Celsus, they saw themselves so grievously deceived by that lawgiver? For nowhere is it said of any one that he was so rich as to lend to many nations. It is not to be believed that they would have fought so zealously in defence of a law whose promises had proved glaringly false, if they understood them in the sense which Celsus gives to them. And if any one should say that the sins which are recorded to have been committed by the people are a proof that they despised the law, doubtless from the feeling that they had been deceived by it, we may reply that we have only to read the history of the times in order to find it shown that the whole people, after having done that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, returned afterwards to their duty, and to the religion prescribed by the law.","title":"Book VII.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":24,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_63_book_viii_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"80","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Having completed seven books, I now propose to begin the eighth.

But those, on the other hand, who have made some advance, and much more those who are perfectly trained in the art, accomplish easily and successfully the objects of their labours, and have great pleasure in the work, and would choose rather thus, in the discharge of the pursuits to which they are accustomed, to finish and carry perfectly out what their efforts aim at, than to be made masters of all those things which are reckoned advantageous among men. Yea, Democritus himself, as it is reported, averred that he would prefer the discovery of one true cause to being put in possession of the kingdom of Persia. And that was the declaration of a man who had only a vain and groundless conception of the causes of things,[fn-14-P1466_419095:79-nf] inasmuch as he started with an unfounded principle, and an erroneous hypothesis, and did not discern the real root and the common law of necessity in the constitution of natural things, and held as the greatest wisdom the apprehension of things that come about simply in an unintelligent and random way, and set up chance[fn-14-P1467_419554:80-nf] as the mistress and queen of things universal, and even things divine, and endeavoured to demonstrate that all things happen by the determination of the same, although at the same time he kept it outside the sphere of the life of men, and convicted those of senselessness who worshipped it. At any rate, at the very beginning of his Precepts[fn-14-P1468_419909:81-nf] he speaks thus: \"Men have made an image[fn-14-P1469_419966:82-nf] of chance, as a cover[fn-14-P1470_420004:83-nf] for their own lack of knowledge. For intellect and chance are in their very nature antagonistic to each other.[fn-14-P1471_420131:84-nf] And men have maintained that this greatest adversary to intelligence is its sovereign. Yea, rather, they completely subvert and do away, with the one, while they establish the other in its place. For they do not celebrate intelligence as the fortunate,[fn-14-P1472_420570:85-nf] but they laud chance[fn-14-P1473_420606:86-nf] as the most intelligent.\"[fn-14-P1474_420654:87-nf] Moreover, those who attend to things conducing to the good of life, take special pleasure in what serves the interests of those of the same race with themselves, and seek the recompense of praise and glory in return for labours undertaken in behalf of the general good; while some exert themselves as purveyors of ways and means,[fn-14-P1475_421006:88-nf] others as magistrates, others as physicians, others as statesmen; and even philosophers pride themselves greatly in their efforts after the education of men. Will, then, Epicurus or Democritus be bold enough to assert that in the exertion of philosophizing they only cause distress to themselves? Nay, rather they will reckon this a pleasure of mind second to none. For even though they maintain the opinion that the good is pleasure, they will be ashamed to deny that philosophizing is the greater pleasure to them.[fn-14-P1476_421539:89-nf] But as to the gods, of whom the poets among them sing that they are the \"bestowers of good gifts,\"[fn-14-P1477_421739:90-nf] these philosophers scoffingly celebrate them in strains like these: \"The gods are neither the bestowers nor the sharers in any good thing.\" And in what manner, forsooth, can they demonstrate that there are gods at all, when they neither perceive their presence, nor discern them as the doers of aught, wherein, indeed, they resemble those who, in their admiration and wonder at the sun and the moon and the stars, have held these to have been named gods,[fn-14-P1478_422255:91-nf] from their running[fn-14-P1479_422287:92-nf] such courses: when, further, they do not attribute to them any function or power of operation,[fn-14-P1480_422404:93-nf] so as to bold them gods[fn-14-P1481_422470:94-nf] from their constituting,[fn-14-P1482_422514:95-nf] that is, from their making objects,[fn-14-P1483_422573:96-nf] for thereby in all truth the one maker and operator of all things must be God: and when, in fine, they do not set forth any administration, or judgment, or beneficence of theirs in relation to men, so that we might be bound either by fear or by reverence to worship them? Has Epicurus then been able, forsooth, to see beyond this world, and to overpass the precincts of heaven? or has he gone forth by some secret gates known to himself alone, and thus obtained sight of the gods in the void?[fn-14-P1484_423081:97-nf] and, deeming them blessed in their full felicity, and then becoming himself a passionate aspirant after such pleasure, and an ardent scholar in that life which they pursue in the void, does he now call upon all to participate in this felicity, and urge them thus to make themselves like the gods, preparing[fn-14-P1485_423480:98-nf] as their true symposium of blessedness neither heaven nor Olympus, as the poets feign, but the sheer void, and setting before them the ambrosia of atoms,[fn-14-P1486_423651:99-nf] and pledging them in[fn-14-P1487_423729:100-nf] nectar made of the same? However, in matters which have no relation to us, he introduces into his books a myriad oaths and solemn asseverations, swearing constantly both negatively and affirmatively by Jove, and making those whom he meets, and with whom he discusses his doctrines, swear also by the gods, not certainly that he fears them himself, or has any dread of perjury, but that he pronounces all this to be vain, and false, and idle, and unintelligible, and uses it simply as a kind of accompaniment to his words, just as he might also clear his throat, or spit, or twist his face, or move his hand. So completely senseless and empty a pretence was this whole matter of the naming of the gods, in his estimation. But this is also a very patent fact, that, being in fear of the Athenians after (the warning of) the death of Socrates, and being desirous of preventing his being taken for what he really was-an atheist-the subtle charlatan invented for them certain empty shadows of unsubstantial gods. But never surely did he look up to heaven with eyes of true intelligence, so as to hear the clear voice from above, which another attentive spectator did hear, and of which he testified when he said, \"The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth His handiwork.\"[fn-14-P1488_425051:101-nf] And never surely did he look down upon the world's surface with due reflection l for then would he have learned that \"the earth is full of the goodness of the Lord\"[fn-14-P1489_425235:102-nf] and that \"the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; \"[fn-14-P1490_425319:103-nf] and that, as we also read, \"After this the Lord looked upon the earth, and filled it with His blessings.

Then, wishing to form us, thereupon He made a certain one, and named Him Word and Wisdom and Son, that He might form us by means of Him.'

In like manner, he says, that there is another Word in God besides the Son, and that the Son again, as partaking of it, is named Word and Son according to grace. And this too is an idea proper to their heresy, as shewn in other works of theirs, that there are many powers; one of which is God's own by nature and eternal; but that Christ, on the other hand, is not the true power of God; but, as others, one of the so-called powers, one of which, namely, the locust and the caterpillar[fn-52-P5294_2076005:20-nf] , is called in Scripture, not merely the power, but the `great power.'

And if, as David says in the 71st Psalm, `His Name remaineth before the sun, and before the moon, from one generation to another[fn-55-P5567_2203895:229-nf] ,' how did He receive what He had always, even before He now received it? or how is He exalted, being before His exaltation the Most High? or how did He receive the right of being worshipped, who before He now received it, was ever worshipped? It is not a dark saying but a divine mystery[fn-55-P5568_2204225:230-nf] . `In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God;' but for our sakes afterwards the `Word was made flesh[fn-55-P5569_2204940:231-nf] .' And the term in question, `highly exalted,' does not signify that the essence of the Word was exalted, for He was ever and is `equal to God[fn-55-P5570_2205113:232-nf] ,' but the exaltation is of the manhood. Accordingly this is not said before the Word became flesh; that it might be plain that `humbled' and `exalted' are spoken of His human nature; for where there is humble estate, there too may be exaltation; and if because of His taking flesh `humbled' is written, it is clear that `highly exalted' is also said because of it. For of this was man's nature in want, because of the humble estate of the flesh and of death. Since then the Word, being the Image of the Father and immortal, took the form of the servant, and as man underwent for us death in His flesh, that thereby He might offer Himself for us through death to the Father; therefore also, as man, He is said because of us and for us to be highly exalted, that as by His death we all died in Christ, so again in the Christ Himself we might be highly exalted, being raised from the dead, and ascending into heaven, `whither the forerunner Jesus is for us entered, not into the figures of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us[fn-55-P5571_2206198:233-nf] .' But if now for us the Christ is entered into heaven itself, though He was even before and always Lord and Framer of the heavens, for us therefore is that present exaltation written. And as He Himself, who sanctifies all, says also that He sanctifies Himself to the Father for our sakes, not that the Word may become holy, but that He Himself may in Himself sanctify all of us, in like manner we must take the present phrase, `He highly exalted Him,' not that He Himself should be exalted, for He is the highest, but that He may become righteousness for us[fn-55-P5572_2206790:234-nf] , and we may be exalted in Him, and that we may enter the gates of heaven, which He has also opened for us, the forerunners saying, `Lift up your gates, O ye rulers, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of Glory shall come in[fn-55-P5573_2207573:235-nf] .' For here also not on Him were shut the gates, as being Lord and Maker of all, but because of us is this too written, to whom the door of paradise was shut. And therefore in a human relation, because of the flesh which He bore, it is said of Him, `Lift up your gates,' and `shall come in,' as if a man were entering; but in a divine relation on the other hand it is said of Him, since `the Word was God,' that He is the `Lord' and the `King of Glory.' Such our exaltation the Spirit foreannounced in the eighty-ninth Psalm, saying, `And in Thy righteousness shall they be exalted, for Thou art the glory of their strength[fn-55-P5574_2208217:236-nf] .'

Such error then being Judaic, and Judaic after the mind of Judas the traitor, let them openly confess themselves scholars of Caiaphas and Herod, instead of cloking Judaism with the name of Christianity, and let them deny outright, as we have said before, the Saviour's appearance in the flesh, for this doctrine is akin to their heresy; or if they fear openly to Judaize and be circumcised[fn-67-P6740_2672633:209-nf] , from servility towards Constantius and for their sake whom they have beguiled, then let them not say what the Jews say; for if they disown the name, let them in fairness renounce the, doctrine. For we are Christians, O Arians, Christians we; our privilege is it well to know the Gospels concerning the Saviour, and neither, with Jews to stone Him, if we hear of His Godhead and Eternity, nor with you to stumbleat such lowly sayings as He may speak for our sakes as man. If then you would become Christians[fn-67-P6741_2673160:210-nf] , put off Arius's madness, and cleanse[fn-67-P6742_2673228:211-nf] with the words of religion those ears of yours which blaspheming has defiled; knowing that, by ceasing to be Arians, you will cease also from the malevolence of the present Jews. Then at once will truth shine on you out of darkness, and ye will no longer reproach us with holding two Eternals[fn-67-P6743_2673567:212-nf] , but ye will yourselves acknowledge that the Lord is God's true Son by nature, and not as merely eternal[fn-67-P6744_2674882:213-nf] , but revealed as co-existing in the Father's eternity. For there are things called eternal of which He is Framer; for in the twenty-third Psalm it is written, `Lift up your gates, O ye rulers, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting gates[fn-67-P6745_2676025:214-nf] ;' and it is plain that through Him these things were made; but if even of things everlasting He is the Framer, who of us shall be able henceforth to dispute that He is anterior to those things eternal, and in consequence is proved to be Lord not so much from His eternity, as in that lie is God's Son; for being the Son, He is inseparable from the Father, and never was there when He was not, but He was always; and being the Father's Image and Radiance, He has the Father's eternity. Now what has been briefly said above may suffice to shew their misunderstanding of the passages they then alleged; and that of what they now allege from the Gospels they certainly give an unsound interpretation[fn-67-P6746_2676742:215-nf] , we may easily see, if we now consider the scope[fn-67-P6747_2676813:216-nf] of that faith which we Christians hold, and using it as a rule, apply ourselves, as the Apostle teaches, to the reading of inspired Scripture. For Christ's enemies, being ignorant of this scope, have wandered from the way of truth, and have stumbled[fn-67-P6748_2677092:217-nf] on a stone of stumbling, thinking otherwise than they should think.","title":"Discourse III","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":24,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_77_letter_vi_for_334_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"11. Who then will lead us to such a company of angels as this?

But not for the impure is this feast, nor is the ascent thereto for sinners; but it is for the virtuous and diligent; and for those who live according to the aim of the saints; for, `Who shall ascend to the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in His holy place, but he that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not devoted his soul to vanity, nor sworn deceitfully to his neighbour. For he,' as the Psalmist adds, when he goes up, `shall receive a blessing from the Lord[fn-91-P9110_3321829:48-nf] .'

Thus Judas, when he thought he kept the Passover, because he plotted deceit against the Saviour, was estranged from the city which is above, and from the apostolic company.
