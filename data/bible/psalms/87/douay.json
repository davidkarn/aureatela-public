{"verses":["A canticle of a psalm for the sons of Core:  unto the end, for\nMaheleth, to answer understanding of Eman the Ezrahite.","O Lord, the God of my salvation:  I have cried in the day, and in\nthe night before thee.","Let my prayer come in before thee:  incline thy ear to my\npetition.","For my soul is filled with evils:  and my life hath drawn nigh to\nhell.","I am counted among them that go down to the pit:  I am become as a\nman without help,","Free among the dead.  Like the slain sleeping in the sepulchres,\nwhom thou rememberest no more:  and they are cut off from thy hand.","They have laid me in the lower pit:  in the dark places, and in\nthe shadow of death.","Thy wrath is strong over me:  and all thy waves thou hast brought\nin upon me.","Thou hast put away my acquaintance far from me:  they have set me\nan abomination to themselves.  I was delivered up, and came not forth:","My eyes languished through poverty.  All the day I cried to thee,\nO Lord:  I stretched out my hands to thee.","Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead?  or shall physicians raise to\nlife, and give praise to thee?","Shall any one in the sepulchre declare thy mercy:  and thy truth\nin destruction?","Shall thy wonders be known in the dark; and thy justice in the\nland of forgetfulness?","But I, O Lord, have cried to thee:  and in the morning my prayer\nshall prevent thee.","Lord, why castest thou off my prayer:  why turnest thou away thy\nface from me?","I am poor, and in labours from my youth:  and being exalted have\nbeen humbled and troubled.","Thy wrath hath come upon me:  and thy terrors have troubled me.","They have come round about me like water all the day:  they have\ncompassed me about together.","Friend and neighbour thou hast put far from me:  and my\nacquaintance, because of misery."]}
