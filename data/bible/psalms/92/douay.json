{"verses":["The Lord hath reigned, he is clothed with beauty:  the Lord is\nclothed with strength, and hath girded himself.  For he hath established\nthe world which shall not be moved.","My throne is prepared from of old:  thou art from everlasting.","The floods have lifted up, O Lord:  the floods have lifted up\ntheir voice.  The floods have lifted up their waves,","With the noise of many waters.  Wonderful are the surges of the\nsea:  wonderful is the Lord on high.","Thy testimonies are become exceedingly credible:  holiness\nbecometh thy house, O Lord, unto length of days."]}
