I have all but passed over the most important point of all. While you were still quite small, bishop Anastasius of holy and blessed memory ruled the Roman church.[fn-52-P5230_1441309:3744-nf] In his days a terrible storm of heresy[fn-52-P5231_1441398:3745-nf] came from the East and strove first to corrupt and then to undermine that simple faith which an apostle has praised.[fn-52-P5232_1441548:3746-nf] However the bishop, rich in poverty and as careful of his flock as an apostle, at once smote the noxious thing on the head, and stayed the hydra's hissing. Now I have reason to fear-in fact a report has reached me to this effect-that the poisonous germs of this heresy still live and sprout in the minds of some to this day. I think, therefore, that I ought to warn you, in all kindness and affection, to hold fast the faith of the saintly Innocent, the spiritual son of Anastasius and his successor in the apostolic see; and not to receive any foreign doctrine, however wise and discerning you may take yourself to be. Men of this type whisper in corners and pretend to inquire into the justice of God. Why, they ask, was a particular soul born in a particular province? What is the reason that some are born of Christian parents, others among wild beasts and savage tribes who have no knowledge of God? Wherever they can strike the simple with their scorpion-sting and form an ulcer fitted to their purpose, there they diffuse their venom. \"Is it for nothing, think you,\"-thus they argue-\"that a little child scarcely able to recognize its mother by a laugh or a look of joy,[fn-52-P5233_1442746:3747-nf] which has done nothing either good or evil, is seized by a devil or overwhelmed with jaundice or doomed to bear afflictions which godless men escape, while God's servants have to bear them?\" Now if God's judgments, they say, are \"true and righteous altogether,\"[fn-52-P5234_1443036:3748-nf] and if \"there is no unrighteousness in Him,\"[fn-52-P5235_1443102:3749-nf] we are compelled by reason to believe that our souls have pre-existed in heaven, that they are condemned to and, if I may so say, buried in human bodies because of some ancient sins, and that we are punished in this valley of weeping[fn-52-P5236_1443359:3750-nf] for old misdeeds. This according to them is the prophet's reason for saying: \"Before I was afflicted I went astray,\"[fn-52-P5237_1443505:3751-nf] and again, \"Bring my soul out of prison.\"[fn-52-P5238_1443570:3752-nf] They explain in the same way the question of the disciples in the gospel: \"Who did sin, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?\"[fn-52-P5239_1443732:3753-nf] and other similar passages.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":92,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"142","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"48. \"BE it so,\" it is rejoined, \"but glory is by no means so absolutely due to the Spirit as to require His exaltation by us in doxologies.\" Whence then could we get demonstrationsof the dignity of theour Spirit, \"passing all understanding,\"[fn-16-P1660_423399:407-nf] if His communion with the Father and the Son were not reckoned by our opponents as good for testimony of His rank? It is, at all events, possible for us to arrive to a certain extent at intelligent apprehension of the sublimity of His nature and of His unapproachable power, by looking at the meaning of His title, and at the magnitude of His operations, and by His good gifts bestowed on us or rather on all creation. He is called Spirit, as \"God is a Spirit,\"[fn-16-P1661_423883:408-nf] and \"the breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the Lord.\"[fn-16-P1662_423965:409-nf] He is called holy,[fn-16-P1663_424004:410-nf] as the Father is holy, and the Son is holy, for to the creature holiness was brought in from without, but to the Spirit holiness is the fulfilment of nature, and it is for this reason that He is described not as being sanctified, but as sanctifying. He is called good,[fn-16-P1664_424293:411-nf] as the Father is good, and He who was begotten of the Good is good, and to the Spirit His goodness is essence. He is called upright,[fn-16-P1665_424672:412-nf] as \"the Lord is upright,\"[fn-16-P1666_424719:413-nf] in that He is Himself truth,[fn-16-P1667_424771:414-nf] and is Himself Righteousness,[fn-16-P1668_424820:415-nf] having no divergence nor leaning to one side or to the other, on account of the immutability of His substance. He is called Paraclete, like the Only begotten, as He Himself says,\" I will ask the Father, and He will give you another comforter.\"[fn-16-P1669_425085:416-nf] Thus names are borne by the Spirit in common with the Father and the Son, and He gets these titles from His natural and close relationship. From what other source could they be derived? Again He is called royal,[fn-16-P1670_425348:417-nf] Spirit of truth,[fn-16-P1671_425390:418-nf] and Spirit of wisdom.[fn-16-P1672_425464:419-nf] \"The Spirit of God,\" it is said \"hath made me,\"[fn-16-P1673_425586:420-nf] and God filled Bezaleel with \"the divine Spirit of wisdom and understanding and knowledge.\"[fn-16-P1674_425703:421-nf] Such names as these are super-eminent and mighty, but they do not transcend His glory.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":92,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_15_book_iii_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"66","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"32.

If any one, however, asserts that if this was the real state of the case, Mark might have mentioned the third hour explicitly at the point at which it really was the third hour, namely, when the voices of the Jews were lifted up demanding that the Lord should be crucified; and, further, that he might have told us plainly there that those vociferators did really crucify Him at that time,-such a reasoner is simply imposing laws upon the historians of truth in his own overweening pride. For he might as well maintain that if he were himself to be a narrator of these occurrences, they ought all to be recorded just in the same way and the same order by all other writers as they have been recorded by himself. Let him therefore be content to reckon his own notion inferior to that of Mark the evangelist, who has judged it right to insert the statement just at the point at which it was suggested to him by divine inspiration. For the recollections of those historians have been ruled by the hand of Him who rules the waters, as it is written, according to His own good pleasure. For the human memory moves[fn-24-P2492_1083331:180-nf] through a variety of thoughts, and it is not in any man's power to regulate either the subject which comes into his mind or the time of its suggestion. Seeing, then, that thoseholy and truthful men, in this matter of the order of their narrations, committed the casualties of their recollections (if such a phrase may be used) to the direction of the hidden power of God, to whom nothing is casual, it does not become any mere man, in his low estate, removed far from the vision of God, and sojourning distantly from Him, to say, \"This ought to have been introduced here;\" for he is utterly ignorant of the reason which led God to will its being inserted in the place it occupies. The word of an apostle is to this effect: \"But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost.\"[fn-24-P2493_1084140:181-nf] And again he says: \"To the one indeed we are the savour of life unto life; to the other, the savour of death unto death;\" and adds immediately, \"And who is sufficient for these things?\"[fn-24-P2494_1084347:182-nf] -that is to say, who is sufficient to comprehend how righteously that is done? The Lord Himself expresses the same when He says, \"I am come that they which see not might see, and that they which see might be made blind.\"[fn-24-P2495_1084590:183-nf] For it is in the depth of the riches of the knowledge and wisdom of God that it comes to pass that of the same lump one vessel is made unto honour, and another unto dishonour.[fn-24-P2496_1084786:184-nf] And to flesh and blood it is said, \"O man, who art thou that repliest against God?\"[fn-24-P2497_1084890:185-nf] Who, then, knows the mind of the Lord in the matter now under consideration? or who hath been His counsellor,[fn-24-P2498_1085020:186-nf] where He has in such wise ruled the hearts of these evangelists in their recollections, and has raised them to so commanding a position of authority in the sublime edifice of His Church, that those very things which are capable of presenting the appearance of contradictions in them become the means by which many are made blind, deservedly given over to the lusts of their own heart, and to a reprobate mind;[fn-24-P2499_1085450:187-nf] and by which also many are exercised in the thorough cultivation of a pious understanding, in accordance with the hidden righteousness of the Almighty?

These are the opinions that he puts forth respecting God, as though He mocked His creatures with names untrue to their meaning, bestowing on the weakest the most honourable appellations, and pouring contempt on the honourable by making them synonymous with the base. Now a virtuous man, if carried, even involuntarily, beyond the limits of truth, is overwhelmed with shame. Yet Eunomius thinks it no shame to God that He should seem to give a false colour to things by their appellations. Not such is the testimony of the Scriptures to the Divine nature. \"God is long-suffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth,\" says David[fn-23-P2304_1500419:83-nf] . But how can He be a God of truth Who gives false names to things, and Who perverts the truth in the meanings of their names? Again, He is called by him a righteous Lord[fn-23-P2305_1500611:84-nf] . Is it, then, a righteous thing to dignify things without honour by honourable names, and, while giving the bare name, to grudge the honour that it denotes? Such is the testimony of these Theologians to their new-fangled God. This is the end of their boasted dialectic cleverness, to display God Himself delighting in deceit, and not superior to the passion of jealousy. For surely it is no better than deceit not to name weak things, as they are in their true nature and worth, but to invest them with empty names, derived from superior things, not proportioning their value to their name; and it is no better than jealousy if, having it in His power to bestow the more honourable appellation on things to be named for some superiority, He grudged them the honour itself, as deeming the happiness of the weak a loss to Himself personally. But I should recommend all who are wise, even if the God of these Gnostics[fn-23-P2306_1501546:85-nf] is by stress of logic shown to be of such a character, not to think thus of the true God, the Only-begotten, but to look at the truth of facts, giving each of them their due, and thence to deduce His name. \"Come, ye blessed,\" saith our Lord; and again, \"Depart, ye cursed[fn-23-P2307_1502026:86-nf] ,\" not honouring him who deserves cursing with the name of \"blessed,\" nor, on the other hand, dismissing him who has treasured up for himself the blessing, along with the wicked.","title":"Answer to Eunomius' Second Book","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":92,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_123_the_epistle_of_pope_urban_first","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"32","folder":"ANF-08","text":"And in exhorting you, we also admonish all who have embraced the faith of Christ, and who have taken from Christ the name of Christian, that ye make your Christianity vain in no respect, but keep stedfastly the engagement which ye took upon yourselves in baptism, so that ye may be found not reprobate, but worthy in His presence. And if any one of you has entered the life which has all things common, and has taken the vow to hold no private property, let him see to it that he make not his promise vain, but let him keep with all faithfulness this engagement which he has made to the Lord, so that he may acquire for himself not damnation, but a reward; for it is better for a man not to take a vow at all than not to discharge to the best of his ability the vow that he has made. For they who have made a vow, or taken on them the faith, and have not kept their vow, or have carried out their life in things evil, are punished more severely than those who have carried out their life without a vow, or have died without faith, but not without doing good works. For to this end have we received a reasonable mind by the gift of nature, and the renewal also of the second birth, that, according to the apostle, we may discern (sapiamus) rather things above, and not things on the earth;[fn-90-P9079_2944996:11-nf] for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.[fn-90-P9080_2945068:12-nf] For to what, most dearly beloved, does the wisdom of this world urge us, but to seek things that are hurtful, and to love things that are to perish, and to neglect things that are healthful, and to esteem as of no value things that are lasting? It commends the love of money, of which it is said, The love of money is the root of all evil;[fn-90-P9081_2945429:13-nf] and which has this evil in especial, that while it obtrudes the transitory, it hides from view the eternal; and while it looks on things that are outside, it does not look in upon things that lurk within; and while it seeks after strange things, it is an evil that makes itself strange to him who does it.[fn-90-P9082_2945755:14-nf] Behold, to what does the wisdom of this world urge a man? To live in pleasures.

Behold, what is the counsel which the wisdom of this world gives?

Thus was He ever learning even as God to converse with men upon earth, being no other than the Word which was to be made flesh.

Surely even these things could not have been believed even of the Son of God, unless they had been given us in the Scriptures; possibly also they could not have been believed of the Father, even if they had been given in the Scriptures, since these men bring Him down into Mary's womb, and set Him before Pilate's judgment-seat, and bury Him in the sepulchre of Joseph. Hence, therefore, their error becomes manifest; for, being ignorant that the entire order of the divine administration has from the very first had its course through the agency of the Son, they believe that the Father Himself was actually seen, and held converse with men. and worked, and was athirst, and suffered hunger (in spite of the prophet who says: \"The everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, shall never thirst at all, nor be hungry; \"[fn-106-P10637_2988074:212-nf] much more, shall neither die at any time, nor be buried!), and therefore that it was uniformly one God, even the Father, who at all times did Himself the things which were really done by Him through the agency of the Son.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":92,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_39_the_great_catechism","source_chapter":49,"source_paragraph":"152","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But, as far as what has been already said, the instruction of this Catechism does not seem to me to be yet complete.

Aye, I am well assured that his intercession is of more avail now than was his instruction in former days, since he is closer to God, now that he has shaken off his bodily fetters, and freed his mind from the clay which obscured it, and holds intercourse naked with the nakedness of the prime and purest Mind; being promoted, if it be not rash to say so, to the rank and confidence of an angel. This, with your power of speech and spirit, you will set forth and discuss better than I can sketch it. But in order that, through ignorance of his excellences, your language may not fall very far short of his deserts, I will, from my own knowledge of the departed, briefly draw an outline, and preliminary plan of an eulogy to be handed to you, the illustrious artist of such subjects, for the details of the beauty of his virtue to be filled in and transmitted to the ears and minds of all.","title":"Oration XVIII.","author":"Gregory Nazianzen"},{"chapter":92,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_13_homily_v_the_germination_of_the_earth_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"10. \"Let the earth bring forth.\" This short command was in a moment a vast nature, an elaborate system. Swifter thanthought it produced the countless qualities of plants. It is this command which, still at this day, is imposed on the earth, and in the course of each year displays all the strength of its power to produce herbs, seeds and trees. Like tops, which after the first impulse, continue their evolutions, turning upon themselves when once fixed in their centre; thus nature, receiving the impulse of this first command, follows without interruption the course of ages, until the consummation of all things.[fn-22-P2282_711330:29-nf] Let us all hasten to attain to it, full of fruit and of good works; and thus, planted in the house of the Lord we shall flourish in the court of our God,[fn-22-P2283_712373:30-nf] in our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and power for ever and ever.

These things, since they are asserted upon the warrant of the Prophetical Scriptures, may possibly silence the Jews, infidel and incredulous though they be. But the Pagans are wont to ridicule us when they hear us speak of a Virgin-birth. We must, therefore, say a few words in reply to their cavils. Every birth, I suppose, depends upon three conditions. There must be a woman of mature age, she must have intercourse with a man, her womb must not be barren. Of these three conditions, in the birth of which we are speaking, one was wanting, the man. And this, forasmuch as He of Whose birth we speak was not an earthly but a heavenly man, was supplied by the Heavenly Spirit, the virginity of the mother being preserved inviolate. And yet why should it be thought marvellous for a virgin to conceive, when it is well known that the Eastern bird, which they call the Phoenix, is in such wise born, or born again, without the intervention of a mate, that it remains continually one, and continually by being born or born again succeeds itself?[fn-97-P9701_2718338:28-nf] That bees know no wedlock, and no bringing forth of young, is notorious. There are also other things which are found to be subject to some such law of birth. Shall it be thought incredible, then, that was done by divine power, for the renewal and restoration of the whole world, of which instances are observed in the nativity of animals? And yet it is strange that the Gentiles should think this impossible, who believe their own Minerva to have been born from the brain of Jupiter. What is more difficult to believe, or what more contrary to nature? Here, there is a woman, the order of nature is kept, there is conception, and in due time birth; there, there is no female, but a man alone, and-birth! Why does he who believes the one marvel at the other? Again, they say that Father Bacchus was born from Jupiter's thigh. Here is another portent, yet it is believed. Venus also, whom they call Aphrodite, was born, they believe, of the foam of the sea, as her compounded name shews. They affirm that Castor and Pollux were born of an egg, the Myrmidons of ants. There are a thousand other things which, though contrary to nature, find credit with them, such as the stones thrown by Deucalion and Pyrrha, and the crop of men sprung from thence. And when they believe such myths and so many of them, does one thing seem impossible to them, that a woman of mature age, not defiled by man but impregnated by the Holy Ghost, should conceive a divine progeny? who, forsooth, if they are hard of belief, ought in no wise to have given credence to those prodigies, being, as they are, so many and so degrading; but if they do believe them, they ought much more readily to receive these beliefs of ours, so honourable and so holy, than theirs so discreditable and so vile.","title":"A Commentary on the Apostles' Creed.","author":"Rufinus"}]
