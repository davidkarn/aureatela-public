{"verses":["Sing ye to the Lord a new canticle:  let his praise be in the\nchurch of the saints.","Let Israel rejoice in him that made him:  and let the children of\nSion be joyful in their king.","Let them praise his name in choir:  let them sing to him with the\ntimbrel and the psaltery.","For the Lord is well pleased with his people:  and he will exalt\nthe meek unto salvation.","The saints shall rejoice in glory:  they shall be joyful in their\nbeds.","The high praises of God shall be in their mouth:  and two-edged\nswords in their hands:","To execute vengeance upon the nations, chastisements among the\npeople:","To bind their kings with fetters, and their nobles with manacles\nof iron.","To execute upon them the judgment that is written:  this glory is\nto all his saints.  Alleluia."]}
