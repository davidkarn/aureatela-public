{"verses":["Unto the end, a psalm for David.  Judge me, O Lord, for I have\nwalked in my innocence:  and I have put my trust in the Lord, and shall\nnot be weakened.","Prove me, O Lord, and try me; burn my reins and my heart.","For thy mercy is before my eyes; and I am well pleased with thy\ntruth.","I have not sat with the council of vanity:  neither will I go in\nwith the doers of unjust things.","I have hated the assembly of the malignant; and with the wicked I\nwill not sit.","I will wash my hands among the innocent; and will compass thy\naltar, O Lord:","That I may hear the voice of thy praise:  and tell of all thy\nwondrous works.","I have loved, O Lord, the beauty of thy house; and the place\nwhere thy glory dwelleth.","Take not away my soul, O God, with the wicked:  nor my life with\nbloody men:","In whose hands are iniquities:  their right hand is filled with\ngifts.","But as for me, I have walked in my innocence:  redeem me, and\nhave mercy on me.","My foot hath stood in the direct way:  in the churches I will\nbless thee, O Lord."]}
