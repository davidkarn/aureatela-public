{"verses":["A gradual canticle.  Often have they fought against me from my\nyouth, let Israel now say.","Often have they fought against me from my youth:  but they could\nnot prevail over me.","The wicked have wrought upon my back:  they have lengthened their\niniquity.","The Lord who is just will cut the necks of sinners:","Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Sion.","Let them be as grass upon the tops of houses:  which withereth\nbefore it be plucked up:","Who with the mower filleth not his hand:  nor he that gathereth\nsheaves his bosom.","And they that passed by have not said:  The blessing of the Lord\nbe upon you:  we have blessed you in the name of the Lord."]}
