{"verses":["Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the\nungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the chair of\npestilence:","But his will is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he shall\nmeditate day and night.","And he shall be like a tree which is planted near the running\nwaters, which shall bring forth its fruit, in due season.  And his leaf\nshall not fall off:  and all whatsoever he shall do shall prosper.","Not so the wicked, not so:  but like the dust, which the wind\ndriveth from the face of the earth.","Therefore the wicked shall not rise again in judgment:  nor sinners\nin the council of the just.","For the Lord knoweth the way of the just:  and the way of the\nwicked shall perish."]}
