But John adds: \"As many as received Him.\" What did He afford to them? Great benevolence! Great mercy! He was born the only Son of God, and was unwilling to remain alone. Many men, when they have not sons, in advanced age adopt a son, and thus obtain by an exercise of will what nature has denied to them: this men do. But if any one have an only son, he rejoices the more in him; because he alone will possess everything, and he will not have any one to divide with him the inheritance, so that he should be poorer. Not so God: that same only Son whom He had begotten, and by whom He created all things, He sent into this world that He might not be alone, but might have adopted brethren. For we were not born of God in the manner in which the Only-begotten was born of Him, but were adopted by His grace. For He, the Only-begotten, came to loose the sins in which we were entangled, and whose burden hindered our adoption: those whom He wished to make brethren to Himself, He Himself loosed, and made joint-heirs. For so saith the apostle, \"But if a son, then an heir through God.\" And again, \"Heirs of God, and join-heirs with Christ.\" He did not fear to have joint-heirs, because His heritage does not become narrow if many are possessors. Those very persons, He being possessor, become His inheritance, and He in turn becomes their inheritance. Hear in what manner they become His inheritance: \"The Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten Thee. Ask of me, and I will give Thee the nations for Thine inheritance.\"[fn-2-P281_57310:13-nf] Hear in what manner He becomes their inheritance. He says in the Psalms: \"The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup.\"[fn-2-P282_57464:14-nf] Let us possess Him, and let Him possess us: let Him possess us as Lord; let us possess Him as salvation, let us possess Him as light. What then did He give to them who received Him? \"To them He gave power to become sons of God, even to them that believe on His name;\" that they may ring to the wood and cross the sea.","title":"Tractate II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"965","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"3. In my younger days I was carried away with a great passion for learning, yet I was not like some presumptuous enough to teach myself.

On the one hand, he lays frequent stress on knowledge concerning God and concerning the nature of sin as the first conditions of salvation; on the other, he insists, less often yet with equal emphasis, upon its being God's spontaneous gift to men, to be appropriated only by faith. We have already seen that one of Hilary's positions is that man must take the first step towards God; that if we will make the beginning He will give the increase[fn-5-P576_393500:389-nf] . This increase is the knowledge of God imparted to willing minds[fn-5-P577_393743:390-nf] , which lifts them up to piety. He states strongly the superiority of knowledge to faith;-\" There is a certain greater effectiveness in knowledge than in faith. Thus the writer here did not believe; he knew[fn-5-P578_393976:391-nf] . For faith has the reward of obedience, but it has not the assurance of ascertained truth. The Apostle has indicated the breadth of the interval between the two by putting the latter in the lower place in his list of the gifts of graces. 'To the first wisdom, to the next knowledge, to the third faith ' is his message[fn-5-P579_394388:392-nf] ; for he who believes may be ignorant even while he believes, but he who has come to know is saved by his possession of knowledge from the very possibility of unbelief[fn-5-P580_394578:393-nf] .\" This high estimation of sound knowledge was due, no doubt, to the intellectual character of the Arian conflict, in which each party retorted upon the other the charge of ignorance and folly; and it must have been confirmed by the observation that some who were conspicuous for the misinterpretation of Scripture were notorious also for moral obliquity. There was, however, that deeper reason which influenced all Hilary's thought; the conviction that if there is to be any harmony, any understanding between God and the soul of man, it must be a perfect harmony and understanding. And knowledge is pre-eminently the sphere in which this is possible, for the revelation of God is clear and precise, and unmistakeable in its import[fn-5-P581_395347:394-nf] . But there was another, a directly practical reason for this insistence. Apprehension of Divine truths is the unfailing test of a Christian mind; conduct changes and faith varies in intensity, but the facts of religion remain the same, and the believer can be judged by his attitude towards them. Hence we cannot be surprised that Hilary maintains the insufficiency of 'simplicity of faith,' and ranks its advocates with heathen philosophers who regard purity of life as a substitute for religion. God, he says, has provided copious knowledge, with which we cannot dispense[fn-5-P582_395955:395-nf] . But this knowledge is to embrace not only the truth concerning God, but also concerning the realities of human life. It is to be a knowledge of the fact that sins have been committed and an opening of the eyes to their enormity[fn-5-P583_396223:396-nf] , This will be followed by confession to God, by the promise to Him that we will henceforth regard Sill as He regards it, and by the profession of a firm purpose to abandon it. Here again the starting-point is human knowledge. When the right attitude towards sin, intellectually and therefore morally, has been assumed, when there is the purpose of amendment and an earnest and successful struggle against sensual and worldly temptations, then we shall become 'worthy of the favour of God[fn-5-P584_396821:397-nf] .' In this light confession is habitually regarded[fn-5-P585_396919:398-nf] ; it is a voluntary moral act, a self-enlightenment to the realities of sin, necessarily followed by repugnance and the effort to escape, and antecedent to Divine pardon and aid. But in contrast to this,Hilary's normal judgment, there are passages where human action is put altogether in the background. Forgiveness is the spontaneous bounty of God, overflowing from the riches of His loving-kindness, and faith the condition of its bestowal and the means by which it is appropriated[fn-5-P586_397740:399-nf] . Even the Psalmist, himself perfect in all good works, prayed for mercy; he put his whole trust in God, and so must we[fn-5-P587_397895:400-nf] . And faith precedes knowledge also, which is unattainable except by the believer[fn-5-P588_398005:401-nf] . Salvation does not come first, and then faith, but through faith is the hope of salvation; the blind man believed before he saw[fn-5-P589_398155:402-nf] . Here again, as in the case of sin, we have two groups of statements without attempt at reconciliation; but that which lays stress upon human initiative is far more numerous than the other, and must be regarded as expressing Hilary's underlying thought in his exhortations to Christian conduct, to his doctrine of which we may now turn.","title":"Introduction","author":false},{"chapter":15,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_10_book_iv_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"6. Therefore on this double death of ours our Saviour bestowed His own single death; and to cause both our resurrections, He appointed beforehand and set forth in mystery and type His own one resurrection. For He was not a sinner or ungodly, that, as though dead in spirit, He should need to be renewed in the inner man, and to be recalled as it were to the life of righteousness by repentance; but being clothed in mortal flesh, and in that alone dying, in that alone rising again, in that alone did He answer to both for us; since in it was wrought a mystery as regards the inner man, and a type as regards the outer. For it was in a mystery as regards our inner man, so as to signify the death of our soul, that those words were uttered, not only in the Psalm, but also on the cross: \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\"[fn-8-P841_325461:25-nf] To which words the apostle agrees, saying, \"Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin;\" since by the crucifixion of the tuner man are understood the pains of repentance, and a certain wholesome agony of self-control, by which death the death of ungodliness is destroyed, and in which death God has left us. And so the body of sin is destroyed through such a cross, that now we should not yield our members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin.[fn-8-P842_326043:26-nf] Because, if even the inner man certainly is renewed day by day,[fn-8-P843_326128:27-nf] yet undoubtedly it is old before it is renewed. For that is done inwardly of which the same apostle speaks: \"Put off the old man, and put on the new;\" which he goes on to explain by saying, \"Wherefore, putting away lying, speak every man truth.\"[fn-8-P844_326394:28-nf] But where is lying put away, unless inwardly, that he who speaketh the truth from his heart may inhabit the holy hill of God?[fn-8-P845_326541:29-nf] But the resurrection of the body of the Lord is shown to belong to the mystery of our own inner resurrection, where, after He had risen, He says to the woman, \"Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father;\"[fn-8-P846_326775:30-nf] with which mystery the apostle's words agree, where he says, \"If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God; set your thoughts[fn-8-P847_326988:31-nf] on things above.\"[fn-8-P848_327019:32-nf] For not to touch Christ, unless when He had ascended to the Father, means not to have thoughts[fn-8-P849_327135:33-nf] of Christ after a fleshly manner. Again, the death of the flesh of our Lord contains a type of the death of our outer man, since it is by such suffering most of all that He exhorts His servants that they should not fear those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul.[fn-8-P850_327429:34-nf] Wherefore the apostle says, \"That I may fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh.\"[fn-8-P851_327559:35-nf] And the resurrection of the body of the Lord is found to contain a type of the resurrection of our outward man, because He says to His disciples, \"Handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.\"[fn-8-P852_327802:36-nf] And one of the disciples also, handling His scars, exclaimed, \"My Lord and my God!\"[fn-8-P853_327907:37-nf] And whereas the entire integrity of that flesh was apparent, this was shown in that which He had said when exhorting His disciples: \"There shall not a hair of your head perish.\"[fn-8-P854_328104:38-nf] For how comes it that first is said, \"Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father;\"[fn-8-P855_328216:39-nf] and how comes it that before He ascends to the Father, He actually is touched by the disciples: unless because in the former the mystery of the inner man was intimated, in the latter a type was given of the outer man? Or can any one possibly be so without understanding, and so turned away from the truth, as to dare to saythat He was touched by men before He ascended, but by women when He had ascended? It was on account of this type, which went before in the Lord, of our future resurrection in the body, that the apostle says, \"Christ the first-fruits; afterward they that are Christ's.\"[fn-8-P856_328826:40-nf] For it was the resurrection of the body to which this place refers, on account of which he also says, \"Who has changed our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body.\"[fn-8-P857_329035:41-nf] The one death therefore of our Saviour brought salvation to our double death, and His one resurrection wrought for us two resurrections; since His body in both cases, that is, both in His death and in His resurrection, wasministered to us by a kind of healing suitableness, both as a mystery of the inner man, and as a type of the outer.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_105_sermon_lxxxviii_cxxxviii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"6.

He saved others, Himself He cannot save.\"[fn-65-P6593_2778395:15-nf] And smiting Him on the head with a reed, they said, \"Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, who smote Thee?\"[fn-65-P6594_2778514:16-nf] Because \"He had neither beauty nor comeliness.\" As such did ye Jews see Him.

But how could she love Him so, if He appeared to her as He did to those blind men persecuting Him, and knowing not what they do? As what then did she love Him?

Be perfect.'[fn-25-P2530_1016266:71-nf] Again, to the Colossians he writes: 'Warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ.'[fn-25-P2531_1016432:72-nf] And so to the Philippians: `Do all things without murmurings and disputings, that ye may be blameless, and harmless, as the immaculate sons of God.'[fn-25-P2532_1016598:73-nf] In like manner to the Ephesians he writes: `Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ; according as He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before Him.'[fn-25-P2533_1016924:74-nf] Then again to the Colossians he says in another passage: `And you, that were sometime alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath He reconciled in the body of His flesh through death; present yourselves holy and unblameable and unreprovable in His sight.'[fn-25-P2534_1017221:75-nf] In the same strain, he says to the Ephesians: `That He might present to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish.'[fn-25-P2535_1017438:76-nf] So in his first Epistle to the Corinthians he says `Be ye sober, and righteous, and sin not.'[fn-25-P2536_1017553:77-nf] So again in the Epistle of St. Peter it is written `Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end, for the grace that is offered to you: . . . as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance: but as He who hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because it is written,[fn-25-P2537_1017946:78-nf] Be ye holy; for I am holy.'[fn-25-P2538_1017992:79-nf] Whence blessed David likewise says: `O Lord, who shall sojourn in Thy tabernacle, or who shall rest on Thy holy mountain? He that walketh without blame, and worketh righteousness.'[fn-25-P2539_1018195:80-nf] And in another passage: `I shall be blameless with Him.'[fn-25-P2540_1018271:81-nf] And yet again: `Blessed are the blameless in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord.'[fn-25-P2541_1018379:82-nf] To the same effect it is written in Solomon: `The Lord loveth holy hearts, and all they that are blameless are acceptable unto Him.'\"[fn-25-P2542_1018531:83-nf] Now some of these passages exhort men who are running their course that they run perfectly; others refer to the end thereof, that men may reach forward to it as they run. He, however, is not unreasonably said to walk blamelessly, not who has already reached the end of his journey, but who is pressing on towards the end in a blameless manner, free from damnable sins, and at the same time not neglecting to cleanse by almsgiving such sins as are venial. For the way in which we walk, that is, the road by which we reach perfection, is cleansed by clean prayer. That, however, is a clean prayer in which we say in truth, \"Forgive us, as we ourselves forgive.\"[fn-25-P2543_1019210:84-nf] So that, as there is nothing censured when blame is not imputed, we may hold on our course to perfection without censure, in a word, blamelessly; and in this perfect state, when we arrive at it at last, we shall find that there is absolutely nothing which requires cleansing by forgiveness.","title":"Concerning Man's Perfection in Righteousness","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_17_book_x","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"12.

Thus then what is written, \"The mouth that lieth, slayeth the soul;\"[fn-43-P4333_2085250:49-nf] of what mouth it speaketh, is the question. For in general when the Scripture speaks of the mouth, it signifies the very seat of our conception[fn-43-P4334_2085412:50-nf] in the heart, where is approved and decreed whatever also by the voice, when we speak the truth, is uttered: so that he lieth with the heart who approveth a lie; yet that man may possibly not lie with the heart, who uttereth other than is in his mind, in such sort that he knows it to be for the sake of avoiding a greater evil that he admitteth an evil, disapproving withal both the one and the other. And they who assert this, say that thus also is to be understood that which is written, \"He that speaketh the truth in his heart:[fn-43-P4335_2085965:51-nf] because always in the heart truth must be spoken; but not always in the mouth of the body, if any cause of avoiding a greater evil require that other than is in the mind be uttered with the voice. And that there is indeed a mouth of the heart, may be understood even from this, that where there is speech, there a mouth is with no absurdity understood: nor would it be right to say, \"Who speaketh in his heart,\" unless it were right to understand that there is also a mouth in the heart. Though in that very place where it is written, \"The mouth that lieth, slayeth the soul,\" if the context of the lesson be considered, it may peradventure be taken for no other than the mouth of the heart. For there is an obscure response there, where it is hidden from men, to whom the mouth of the heart, unless the mouth of the body sound therewith, is not audible. But that mouth, the Scripture in that place saith, doth reach to the hearing of the Spirit of the Lord, Who hath filled the whole earth; at the same time mentioning lips and voice and tongue in that place; yet all these the sense permitteth not to be taken, but concerning the heart, because it saith of the Lord, that what is spoken is not hidden from Him: now that which is spoken with that sound which reacheth to our ears, is not hidden from men either. Thus, namely, is it written: \"The Spirit of wisdom is loving, and will not acquit an evil-speaker of his lips: for of his reins God is witness, and of his heart a true searcher, and of his tongue a hearer. For the Spirit of the Lord hath filled the whole earth, and that which containeth all things hath knowledge of the voice. Therefore he that speaketh unrighteous things cannot be hid: but neither shall the judgment when it punisheth pass by him. For in the thoughts of the ungodly shall there be interrogation; and the hearing of his words shall come from the Lord, to the punishment of his iniquities.[fn-43-P4336_2087902:52-nf] For the ear of jealousy heareth all things, and the tumult of murmurings will not be hid. Therefore keep yourselves from murmuring, which profiteth nothing, and from backbiting refrain your tongue: because an obscure response will not go into the void.[fn-43-P4337_2088195:53-nf] But the mouth that lieth, slayeth the soul.\"[fn-43-P4338_2088347:54-nf] It seems then to threaten them who think that to be obscure and secret, which they agitate and turn over in their heart. And this, it would show, is so clear to the ears of God, that it even calls it \"tumult.\"32. Manifestly also in the Gospel we find the mouth of the heart: so that in one place the Lord is found to have mentioned the mouth both of the body and of the heart, where he saith, \"Are ye also yet without understanding? Do ye not yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth, goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart, and they defile the man. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: these are the things which defile a man.\"[fn-43-P4339_2089182:55-nf] Here if thou understand but one mouth, that of the body, how wilt thou understand, \"Those things which proceed out of the mouth, come forth from the heart;\" since spitting also and vomiting proceed out of the mouth? Unless peradventure a man is but then defiled when he eateth aught unclean, but is defiled when he vomits it up. But if this be most absurd, it remains that we understand the mouth of the heart to have been expounded by the Lord, when He saith, \"The things which proceed out of the mouth, come forth from the heart.\" For being that theft: also can be, and often is, perpetrated with silence of the bodily voice and mouth; one must be out of his mind so to understand it as then to account a person to be contaminated by the sin of theft, when he confesses or makes it known, but when he commits it and holds his peace, then to think him undefiled. But, in truth, if we refer what is said to the mouth of the heart, no sin whatever can be committed tacitly: for it is not committed unless it proceed from that mouth which is within.","title":"On Lying.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_36_against_lying_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"21","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"14.

We are not like some, who, despising all humility, are eager to buy the episcopate with gold; nor do we wish, with the minds of rebels, to suppress the Pontiff chosen by God;[fn-92-P9204_2475162:77-nf] nor do we, by favouring heretics, show that we are heretics ourselves. As for money, we neither have it nor desire to have it.[fn-92-P9205_2475385:78-nf] \"Having food and clothing, we are therewith content;\" and meanwhile we constantly chant the words describing the man who shall ascend to the hill of the Lord:[fn-92-P9206_2475564:79-nf] \"He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent; be who doeth these things shall not be moved eternally.\" We may add that he who does the opposite to these will fall eternally.","title":"Jerome's Apology for Himself Against the Books of Rufinus.","author":"Rufinus"},{"chapter":15,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_55_book_iv_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"47","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"13. By this patience of Christian love he not only endured the difference of opinion manifested in all kindliness by his good colleagues on an obscure point, as he also himself received toleration, till, in process of time, when it so pleased God, what had always been a most wholesome custom was further confirmed by a declaration of the truth in a plenary Council, but he even put up with those who were manifestly bad, as was very well known to himself, who did not entertain a different view in consequence of the obscurity of the question, but acted contrary to their preaching in the evil practices of an abandoned life, as the apostle says of them \"Thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?\"[fn-34-P3488_1978207:47-nf] For Cyprian says in his letter of such bishops of his own time, his own colleagues, and remaining in communion with him, \"While they had brethren starving in the Church, they tried to amass large sums of money, they took possession of estates by fraudulent proceedings, they multiplied their gains by accumulated usuries.\"[fn-34-P3489_1978547:48-nf] For here there is no obscure question.

And yet with the bowels of fatherly and motherly love he endured them, lest that, by rooting out the tares before their time, the wheat should also have been rooted up,[fn-34-P3493_1979483:52-nf] imitating assuredly the Apostle Paul, who, with the same love towards the Church, endured those who were ill-disposed and envious towards him.[fn-34-P3494_1979647:53-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":15,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_60_book_iii_","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"86","folder":"ANF-01","text":"2. For Peter said, \"Ye men of Israel, hear my words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved by God among you by powers, and wonders, and signs, which God did by Him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know: Him, being delivered by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, by the hands of wicked men ye have slain, affixing [to the cross]: whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death; because it was not possible that he should be holden of them.
