{"verses":["The inscription of a title to David himself.  Preserve me, O Lord,\nfor I have put my trust in thee.","I have said to the Lord, thou art my God, for thou hast no need\nof my goods.","To the saints, who are in his land, he hath made wonderful all my\ndesires in them.","Their infirmities were multiplied:  afterwards they made haste.  I\nwill not gather together their meetings for bloodofferings:  nor will I\nbe mindful of their names by my lips.","The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup:  it is\nthou that wilt restore my inheritance to me.","The lines are fallen unto me in goodly places:  for my inheritance\nis goodly to me.","I will bless the Lord, who hath given me understanding:  moreover,\nmy reins also have corrected me even till night.","I set the Lord always in my sight:  for he is at my right hand,\nthat I be not moved.","Therefore my heart hath been glad, and my tongue hath rejoiced:\nmoreover, my flesh also shall rest in hope.","Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; nor wilt thou give\nthy holy one to see corruption.","Thou hast made known to me the ways of life, thou shalt fill me\nwith joy with thy countenance:  at thy right hand are delights even to\nthe end."]}
