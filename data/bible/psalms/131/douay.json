{"verses":["A gradual canticle.  O Lord, remember David, and all his\nmeekness.","How he swore to the Lord, he vowed a vow to the God of Jacob:","If I shall enter into the tabernacle of my house:  if I shall go\nup into the bed wherein I lie:","If I shall give sleep to my eyes, or slumber to my eyelids,","Or rest to my temples:  until I find out a place for the Lord, a\ntabernacle for the God of Jacob.","Behold we have heard of it in Ephrata:  we have found it in the\nfields of the wood.","We will go into his tabernacle:  we will adore in the place where\nhis feet stood.","Arise, O Lord, into thy resting place:  thou and the ark, which\nthou hast sanctified.","Let thy priests be clothed with justice:  and let thy saints\nrejoice.","For thy servant David's sake, turn not away the face of thy\nanointed.","The Lord hath sworn truth to David, and he will not make it\nvoid:  of the fruit of thy womb I will set upon thy throne.","If thy children will keep my covenant, and these my testimonies\nwhich I shall teach them:  Their children also for evermore shall sit\nupon thy throne.","For the Lord hath chosen Sion:  he hath chosen it for his\ndwelling.","This is my rest for ever and ever:  here will I dwell, for I\nhave chosen it.","Blessing I will bless her widow:  I will satisfy her poor with\nbread.","I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints shall\nrejoice with exceeding great joy.","There will I bring forth a horn to David:  I have prepared a\nlamp for my anointed.","His enemies I will clothe with confusion:  but upon him shall my\nsanctification flourish."]}
