{"verses":["Praise ye the Lord from the heavens:  praise ye him in the high\nplaces.","Praise ye him, all his angels, praise ye him, all his hosts.","Praise ye him, O sun and moon:  praise him, all ye stars and\nlight.","Praise him, ye heavens of heavens:  and let all the waters that\nare above the heavens","Praise the name of the Lord.  For he spoke, and they were made:\nhe commanded, and they were created.","He hath established them for ever, and for ages of ages:  he hath\nmade a decree, and it shall not pass away.","Praise the Lord from the earth, ye dragons, and all ye deeps:","Fire, hail, snow, ice, stormy winds, which fulfil his word:","Mountains and all hills, fruitful trees and all cedars:","Beasts and all cattle:  serpents and feathered fowls:","Kings of the earth and all people:  princes and all judges of\nthe earth:","Young men and maidens:  let the old with the younger, praise the\nname of the Lord:","For his name alone is exalted.","The praise of him is above heaven and earth:  and he hath\nexalted the horn of his people.  A hymn to all his saints to the\nchildren of Israel, a people approaching to him.  Alleluia."]}
