{"verses":["A psalm for Asaph.  God hath stood in the congregation of gods:\nand being in the midst of them he judgeth gods.","How long will you judge unjustly:  and accept the persons of the\nwicked?","Judge for the needy and fatherless:  do justice to the humble and\nthe poor.","Rescue the poor; and deliver the needy out of the hand of the\nsinner.","They have not known nor understood:  they walk on in darkness:  all\nthe foundations of the earth shall be moved.","I have said:  You are gods and all of you the sons of the most\nHigh.","But you like men shall die:  and shall fall like one of the\nprinces.","Arise, O God, judge thou the earth:  for thou shalt inherit among\nall the nations."]}
