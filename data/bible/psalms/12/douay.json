{"verses":["Unto the end, a psalm for David.  How long, O Lord, wilt thou\nforget me unto the end?  how long dost thou turn away thy face from me?","How long shall I take counsels in my soul, sorrow in my heart all\nthe day?","How long shall my enemy be exalted over Me?","Consider, and hear me, O Lord, my God.  Enlighten my eyes, that I\nnever sleep in death:","Lest at any time my enemy say:  I have prevailed against him.  They\nthat trouble me, will rejoice when I am moved:","But I have trusted in thy mercy.  My heart shall rejoice in thy\nsalvation:  I will sing to the Lord, who giveth me good things:  yea, I\nwill sing to the name of the Lord, the most high."]}
