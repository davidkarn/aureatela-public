{"verses":["A psalm for Asaph.  How good is God to Israel, to them that are of\na right heart!","But my feet were almost moved; my steps had well nigh slipped.","Because I had a zeal on occasion of the wicked, seeing the\nprosperity of sinners.","For there is no regard to their death, nor is there strength in\ntheir stripes.","They are not in the labour of men:  neither shall they be scourged\nlike other men.","Therefore pride hath held them fast:  they are covered with their\niniquity and their wickedness.","Their iniquity hath come forth, as it were from fatness:  they\nhave passed into the affection of the heart.","They have thought and spoken wickedness:  they have spoken\niniquity on high.","They have set their mouth against heaven:  and their tongue hath\npassed through the earth.","Therefore will my people return here and full days shall be\nfound in them.","And they said:  How doth God know?  and is there knowledge in the\nmost High?","Behold these are sinners; and yet, abounding in the world they\nhave obtained riches.","And I said:  Then have I in vain justified my heart, and washed\nmy hands among the innocent.","And I have been scourged all the day; and my chastisement hath\nbeen in the mornings.","If I said:  I will speak thus; behold I should condemn the\ngeneration of thy children.","I studied that I might know this thing, it is a labour in my\nsight:","Until I go into the sanctuary of God, and understand concerning\ntheir last ends.","But indeed for deceits thou hast put it to them:  when they were\nlifted up thou hast cast them down.","How are they brought to desolation?  they have suddenly ceased to\nbe:  they have perished by reason of their iniquity.","As the dream of them that awake, O Lord; so in thy city thou\nshalt bring their image to nothing.","For my heart hath been inflamed, and my reins have been changed:","And I am brought to nothing, and I knew not.","I am become as a beast before thee:  and I am always with thee.","Thou hast held me by my right hand; and by thy will thou hast\nconducted me, and with thy glory thou hast received me.","For what have I in heaven?  and besides thee what do I desire\nupon earth?","For thee my flesh and my heart hath fainted away:  thou art the\nGod of my heart, and the God that is my portion for ever.","For behold they that go far from thee shall perish:  thou hast\ndestroyed all them that are disloyal to thee.","But it is good for me to adhere to my God, to put my hope in the\nLord God:  That I may declare all thy praises, in the gates of the\ndaughter of Sion."]}
