For this contemplation is held forth to us as the end of all actions, and the everlasting fullness of joy. For \"we are the sons of God; and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is.\"[fn-2-P275_96558:73-nf] For that which He said to His servant Moses, \"I am that I am; thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel, I Am hath sent me to you;\"[fn-2-P276_96714:74-nf] this it is which we shall contemplate when we shall live in eternity. For so it is said, \"And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.\"[fn-2-P277_96933:75-nf] This shall be when the Lord shall have come, and \"shall have brought to light the hidden things of darkness;\"[fn-2-P278_97062:76-nf] when the darkness of this present mortality and corruption shall have passed away. Then will be our morning, which is spoken of in the Psalm, \"In the morning will I direct my prayer unto Thee, and will contemplate Thee.\"[fn-2-P279_97302:77-nf] Of this contemplation I understand it to be said, \"When He shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father;\" that is, when He shall have brought the just, over whom now, living by faith, the Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus, reigns, to the contemplation of God, even the Father. If herein I am foolish, let him who knows better correct me; to me at least the case seems as I have said.[fn-2-P280_97733:78-nf] For we shall not seek anything else, when we shall have come to the contemplation of Him. But that contemplation is not yet, so long as our joy is in hope. For \"hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it,\"[fn-2-P281_98566:79-nf] viz. \"as long as the King sitteth at His table.\"[fn-2-P282_98639:80-nf] Then will take place that which is written, \"In Thy presence is fullness of joy.\"[fn-2-P283_98739:81-nf] Nothing more than that joy will be required; because there will be nothing more than can be required. For the Father will be manifested to us, and that will suffice for us. And this much Philip had well understood, so that he said to the Lord, \"Show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.\" But he had not yet understood that he himself was able to say this very same thing in this way also: Lord, show Thyself to us, and it sufficeth us. For, that he might understand this, the Lord replied to him, \"Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father.\" But because He intended him, before he could see this, to live by faith, He went on to say, \"Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?\"[fn-2-P284_99533:82-nf] For \"while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: for we walk by faith, not by sight.\"[fn-2-P285_99661:83-nf] For contemplation is the recompense of faith, for which recompense our hearts are purified by faith; as it is written, \"Purifying their hearts by faith.\"[fn-2-P286_99836:84-nf] And that our hearts are to be purified for this contemplation, is proved above all by this text, \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\"[fn-2-P287_100007:85-nf] And that this is life eternal, God says in the Psalm, \"With long life will I satisfy him, and show him my salvation,\"[fn-2-P288_100142:86-nf] Whether, therefore, we hear, Show us the Son; or whether we hear, Show us the Father; it is even all one, since neither can be manifested without the other. For they are one, as He also Himself says, \"My Father and I are one.\"[fn-2-P289_100387:87-nf] Finally, on account of this very indivisibility, it suffices that sometimes the Father alone, or the Son alone, should be named, as hereafter to fill us with the joy of His countenance.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":91,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"312","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"3.

My reverend son Heraclius the deacon has reported to me that in your eagerness to see me you came as far as Cissa, and that, though a Pannonian and consequently a land animal, you did not quail before the surges of the Adriatic and the dangers of the Aegean and Ionian seas. He tells me that you would have actually accomplished your purpose, had not our brethren with affectionate care held you back. I thank you all the same and regard it as a kindness shewn. For in the case of friends one must accept the will for the deed. Enemies often give us the latter, but only sincere attachment can bring us the former. And now that I am writing to you I beseech you do not regard the bodily affliction which has befallen you as due to sin. When the Apostles speculated concerning the man that was born blind from the womb and asked our Lord and Saviour: \"Who did sin, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?\" they were told \"Neither hath this man sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.\"[fn-28-P2812_738229:1996-nf] Do we not see numbers of heathens, Jews, heretics and men of various opinions rolling in the mire of lust, bathed in blood, surpassing wolves in ferocity and kites in rapacity, and for all this the plague does not come nigh their dwellings?[fn-28-P2813_738503:1997-nf] They are not smitten as other men, and accordingly they wax insolent against God and lift up their faces even to heaven. We know on the other hand that holy men are afflicted with sicknesses, miseries, and want, and perhaps they are tempted to say \"Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.\" Yet immediately they go on to reprove themselves, \"If I say, I will speak thus; behold I should offend against the generation of thy children.\"[fn-28-P2814_738995:1998-nf] If you suppose that your blindness is caused by sin, and that a disease which physicians are often able to cure is an evidence of God's anger, you will think Isaac a sinner because he was so wholly sightless that he was deceived into blessing one whom he did not mean to bless.[fn-28-P2815_739314:1999-nf] You will charge Jacob with sin, whose vision became so dim that he could not see Ephraim and Manasseh,[fn-28-P2816_739438:2000-nf] although with the inner eye and the prophetic spirit he could foresee the distant future and the Christ that was to come of his royal line.[fn-28-P2817_739604:2001-nf] Were any of the kings holier than Josiah? Yet he was slain by the sword of the Egyptians.[fn-28-P2818_739718:2002-nf] Were there ever loftier saints than Peter and Paul? Yet their blood stained the blade of Nero. And to say no more of men, did not the Son of God endure the shame of the cross? And yet you fancy those blessed who enjoy in this world happiness and pleasure? God's hottest anger against sinners is when he shews no anger. Wherefore in Ezekiel he says to Jerusalem: \"My jealousy will depart from thee and i will be quiet and will be no more angry.\"[fn-28-P2819_740188:2003-nf] For \"whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth.\"[fn-28-P2820_740379:2004-nf] The father does not instruct his son unless he loves him.

We have sufficiently spoken of the Father and of the Son, so far as was possible for us to see through this glass and in this enigma. We must now treat of the Holy Spirit, so far as by God's gift it is permitted to see Him. And the Holy Spirit, according to the Holy Scriptures, is neither of the Father alone, nor of the Son alone, but of both; and so intimates to us a mutual love, wherewith the Father and the Son reciprocally love one another. But the language of the Word of God, in order to exercise us, has caused those things to be sought into with the greater zeal, which do not lie on the surface, but are to be scrutinized in hidden depths, and to be drawn out from thence. The Scriptures, accordingly, have not said, The Holy Spirit is Love. If they had said so, they would have done away with no small part of this inquiry. But they have said, \"God is love;\"[fn-20-P2024_1028401:61-nf] so that it is uncertain and remains to be inquired whether God the Father is love, or God the Son, or God the Holy Ghost, or the Trinity itself which is God. For we are not going to say that God is called Love because love itself is a substance worthy of the name of God, but because it is a gift of God, as it is said to God, \"Thou art my patience.\"[fn-20-P2025_1028772:62-nf] For this is not said because our patience is God's substance, but in that He Himself gives it to us; as it is elsewhere read, \"Since from Him is my patience.\"[fn-20-P2026_1028949:63-nf] For the usage of words itself in Scripture sufficiently refutes this interpretation; for \"Thou art my patience\" is of the same kind as \"Thou, Lord, art my hope,\"[fn-20-P2027_1029129:64-nf] and \"The Lord my God is my mercy,\"[fn-20-P2028_1029181:65-nf] and many like texts. And it is not said, O Lord my love, or, Thou art my love, or, God my love; but it is said thus, \"God is love,\" as it is said, \"God is a Spirit.\"[fn-20-P2029_1029365:66-nf] And he who does not discern this, must ask understanding from the Lord, not an explanation from us; for we cannot say anything more clearly.","title":"Book XV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":91,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_31_the_epistle_of_ignatius_to_the_philippians","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"38","folder":"ANF-01","text":"Darest thou, then, who didst fall \"as lightning\"[fn-29-P2924_475187:46-nf] from the very highest glory, to say to the Lord, \"Cast thyself down from hence[fn-29-P2925_475283:47-nf] [to Him] to whom the things that are not are reckoned as if they were,[fn-29-P2926_475372:48-nf] and to provoke to a display of vainglory Him that was free from all ostentation? And didst thou pretend to read in Scripture concerning Him: \"For He hath given His angels charge concerning Thee, and in their hands they shall bear Thee up, lest thou shouldest dash Thy foot against a stone? \"[fn-29-P2927_475688:49-nf] At the same time thou didst pretend to be ignorant of the rest, furtively concealing what [the Scripture] predicted concerning thee and thy servants: \"Thou shalt tread upon the adder and the basilisk; the lion and the dragon shall thou trample under foot.\"[fn-29-P2928_475964:50-nf] ","title":"The Epistle of Ignatius to the Philippians","author":"Ignatius"},{"chapter":91,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"98","folder":"ANF-03","text":"He likewise adds, that they should say to such as would not receive them: \"Notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.\"[fn-62-P6271_1865887:963-nf] If He does not enjoin this by way of a commination, the injunction is a most useless one. For what mattered it to them that the kingdom was at hand, unless its approach was accompanied with judgment?-even for the salvation of such as received the announcement thereof. How, if there can be a threat without its accomplishment, can you have in a threatening god, one that executes also, and in both, one that is a judicial being?[fn-62-P6272_1866335:964-nf] So, again, He commands that the dust be shaken off against them, as a testimony,-the very particles of their ground which might cleave[fn-62-P6273_1866500:965-nf] to the sandal, not to mention[fn-62-P6274_1866548:966-nf] any other sort of communication with them.[fn-62-P6275_1866605:967-nf] But if their churlishness[fn-62-P6276_1866650:968-nf] and inhospitality were to receive no vengeance from Him, for what purpose does He premise a testimony, which surely forbodes some threats? Furthermore, when the Creator also, in the book of Deuteronomy, forbids the reception of the Ammonites and the Moabites into the church,[fn-62-P6277_1866946:969-nf] because, when His people came from Egypt, they fraudulently withheld provisions from them with inhumanity and inhospitality,[fn-62-P6278_1867238:970-nf] it will be manifest that the prohibition of intercourse descended to Christ from Him. The form of it which He uses-\"He that despiseth you, despiseth me\"[fn-62-P6279_1867414:971-nf] -the Creator had also addressed to Moses: \"Not against thee have they murmured, but against me.\"[fn-62-P6280_1867530:972-nf] Moses, indeed, was as much an apostle as the apostles were prophets. The authority of both offices will have to be equally divided, as it proceeds from one and the same Lord, (the God) of apostles and prophets. Who is He that shall bestow \"the power of treading on serpents and scorpions? \"[fn-62-P6281_1867842:973-nf] Shall it be He who is the Lord of all living creatures or he who is not god over a single lizard? Happily the Creator has promised by Isaiah to give this power even to little children, of putting their hand in the cockatrice den and on the hole of the young asps without at all receiving hurt.[fn-62-P6282_1868155:974-nf] And, indeed, we are aware (without doing violence to the literal sense of the passage, since even these noxious animals have actually been unable to do hurt where there has been faith) that under the figure of scorpions and serpents are portended evil spirits, whose very prince is described[fn-62-P6283_1868468:975-nf] by the name of serpent, dragon, and every other most conspicuous beast in the power of the Creator.[fn-62-P6284_1868586:976-nf] This power the Creator conferred first of all upon His Christ, even as the ninetieth Psalm says to Him: \"Upon the asp and the basilisk shall Thou tread; the lion and the dragon shall Thou trample under foot.\"[fn-62-P6285_1868819:977-nf] So also Isaiah: \"In that day the Lord God shall draw His sacred, great, and strong sword\" (even His Christ) \"against that dragon, that great and tortuous serpent; and He shall slay him in that day.\"[fn-62-P6286_1869038:978-nf] But when the same prophet says, \"The way shall be called a clean and holy way; over it the unclean thing shall not pass, nor shall be there any unclean way; but the dispersed shall pass over it, and they shall not err therein; no lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon; it shall not be found there,\"[fn-62-P6287_1869391:979-nf] he points out the way of faith, by which we shall reach to God; and then to this way of faith he promises this utter crippling[fn-62-P6288_1869547:980-nf] and subjugation of all noxious animals. Lastly, you may discover the suitable times of the promise, if you read what precedes the passage: \"Be strong, ye weak hands and ye feeble knees: then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall hear; then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall be articulate.\"[fn-62-P6289_1869925:981-nf] When, therefore, He proclaimed the benefits of His cures, then also did He put the scorpions and the serpents under the feet of His saints-even He who had first received this power from the Father, in order to bestow it upon others and then manifested it forth conformably to the order of prophecy.[fn-62-P6290_1870256:982-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":91,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"38","folder":"ANF-03","text":"In various ways has the devil rivalled and resisted the truth. Sometimes his aim has been to destroy the truth by defending it. He maintains that there is one only Lord, the Almighty Creator of the world, in order that out of this doctrine of the unity he may fabricate a heresy. He says that the Father Himself came down into the Virgin, was Himself born of her, Himself suffered, indeed was Himself Jesus Christ. Here the old serpent has fallen out with himself, since, when he tempted Christ after John's baptism, he approached Him as \"the Son of God; \"surely intimating that God had a Son, even on the testimony of the very Scriptures, out of which he was at the moment forging his temptation: \"If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.\"[fn-103-P10383_2908627:3-nf] Again: \"If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence;[fn-103-P10384_2908708:4-nf] for it is written, He shall give His angels charge concerning thee\"-referring no doubt, to the Father-\"and in their hands they shall bear thee up, that thou hurt not thy foot against a stone.\"[fn-103-P10385_2908912:5-nf] Or perhaps, after all, he was only reproaching the Gospels with a lie, saying in fact: \"Away with Matthew; away with Luke! Why heed their words? In spite of them, I declare that it was God Himself that I approached; it was the Almighty Himself that I tempted face to face; and it was for no other purpose than to tempt Him that I approached Him. If, on the contrary, it had been only the Son of God, most likely I should never have condescended to deal with Him.\" However, he is himself a liar from the beginning,[fn-103-P10386_2909442:6-nf] and whatever man he instigates in his own way; as, for instance, Praxeas. For he was the first to import into Rome from Asia this kind of heretical pravity, a man in other respects of restless disposition, and above all inflated with the pride of confessorship simply and solely because he had to bear for a short time the annoyance of a prison; on which occasion, even \"if he had given his body to be burned, it would have profiled him nothing,\" not having the love of God,[fn-103-P10387_2909935:7-nf] whose very gifts he has resisted and destroyed. For after the Bishop of Rome[fn-103-P10388_2910031:8-nf] had acknowledged the prophetic gifts of Montanus, Prisca, and Maximilla, and, in consequence of the acknowledgment, had bestowed his peace[fn-103-P10389_2910208:9-nf] on the churches of Asia and Phrygia, he, by importunately urging false accusations against the prophets themselves and their churches, and insisting on the authority of the bishop's predecessors in the see, compelled him to recall the pacific letter which he had issued, as well as to desist from his purpose of acknowledging the said gifts. By this Praxeas did a twofold service for the devil at Rome: he drove away prophecy, and he brought in heresy; he put to flight the Paraclete, and he crucified the Father.

Let me then speak of it, since it is necessary, and let me put an end to my hesitation. In truth the most difficult of sciences is to know one's self. Not only our eye, from which nothing outside us escapes, cannot see itself; but our mind, so piercing to discover the sins of others, is slow to recognise its own faults.[fn-25-P2530_852196:34-nf] Thus my speech, after eagerly investigating what is external to myself, is slow and hesitating in exploring my own nature.

Where is the Jew who resisted the truth and pretended that God was speaking to Himself? It is He who spoke, it is said, and it is He who made. \"Let there be light and there was light.\" But then their words contain a manifest absurdity. Where is the smith, the carpenter, the shoemaker, who, without help and alone before the instruments of his trade, would say to himself; let us make the sword, let us put together the plough, let us make the boot? Does he not perform the work of his craft in silence? Strange folly, to say that any one has seated himself to command himself, to watch over himself, to constrain himself, to hurry himself, with the tones of a master! But the unhappy creatures are not afraid to calumniate the Lord Himself. What will they not say with a tongue so well practised in lying? Here, however, words stop their mouth; \"And God said let us make man.\" Tell me; is there then only one Person? It isnot written \"Let man be made,\" but, \"Let us make man.\" The preaching of theology remains enveloped in shadow before the appearance of him who was to be instructed, but, now, the creation of man is expected, that faith unveils herself and the dogma of truth appears in all its light. \"Let us make \"O enemy of Christ, man.Oy ofhear God speaking to His Co-operator, to Him by Whom also He made the worlds, Who upholds all things by the word of His power.[fn-25-P2534_854563:38-nf] But He does not leave the voice of true religion without answer. Thus the Jews, race hostile to truth, when they find themselves pressed, act like beasts enraged against man, who roar at the bars of their cage and show the cruelty and the ferocity of their nature, without being able to assuage their fury. God, they say, addresses Himself to several persons; it is to the angels before Him that He says, \"Let us make man.\" Jewish fiction! a fable whose frivolity shows whence it has come. To reject one person, they admit many. To reject the Son, they raise servants to the dignity of counsellors; they make of our fellow slaves the agents in our creation. The perfect man attains the dignity of an angel; but what creature can be like the Creator? Listen to the continuation. \"In our image.\" What have you to reply? Is there one image of God and the angels? Father and Son have by absolute necessity the same form, but the form is here understood as becomes the divine, not in bodily shape, but in the proper qualities of Godhead. Hear also, you who belong to the new concision[fn-25-P2535_855666:39-nf] and who, under the appearance of Christianity, strengthen the error of the Jews.[fn-25-P2536_855766:40-nf] To Whom does He say, \"in our image,\" to whom if it is not to Him who is \"the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person,\"[fn-25-P2537_855922:41-nf] \"the image of the invisible God\"?[fn-25-P2538_855972:42-nf] It is then to His living image, to Him Who has said \"I and my Father are one,\"[fn-25-P2539_856068:43-nf] \"He that hath seen me hath seen the Father,\"[fn-25-P2540_856130:44-nf] that God says \"Let us make man in our image.\" Where is the unlikeness[fn-25-P2541_856218:45-nf] in these Beings who have only one image? \"So God created man,\"[fn-25-P2542_856370:46-nf] It is not \"They made.\" Here Scripture avoids the plurality of the Persons. After having enlightened the Jew, it dissipates the error of the Gentiles in putting itself under the shelter of unity, to make you understand that the Son is with the Father, and guarding you from the danger of polytheism.
