{"verses":["Unto the end, in hymns, for David.","Hear, O God, my supplication:  be attentive to my prayer.","To thee have I cried from the ends of the earth:  when my heart\nwas in anguish, thou hast exalted me on a rock.  Thou hast conducted me;","For thou hast been my hope; a tower of strength against the face\nof the enemy.","In thy tabernacle I shall dwell for ever:  I shall be protected\nunder the covert of thy wings.","For thou, my God, hast heard my prayer:  thou hast given an\ninheritance to them that fear thy name.","Thou wilt add days to the days of the king:  his years even to\ngeneration and generation.","He abideth for ever in the sight of God:  his mercy and truth who\nshall search?","So will I sing a psalm to thy name for ever and ever:  that I may\npay my vows from day to day."]}
