{"verses":["Praise the Lord, ye children:  praise ye the name of the Lord.","Blessed be the name of the Lord, from henceforth now and for\never.","From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same, the\nname of the Lord is worthy of praise.","The Lord is high above all nations; and his glory above the\nheavens.","Who is as the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high:","and looketh\ndown on the low things in heaven and in earth?","Raising up the needy from the earth, and lifting up the poor out\nof the dunghill:","That he may place him with princes, with the princes of his\npeople.","Who maketh a barren woman to dwell in a house, the joyful mother\nof children."]}
