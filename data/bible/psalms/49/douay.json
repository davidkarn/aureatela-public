{"verses":["A psalm for Asaph.  The God of gods, the Lord hath spoken:  and he\nhath called the earth.  From the rising of the sun, to the going down\nthereof:","Out of Sion the loveliness of his beauty.","God shall come manifestly:  our God shall come, and shall not keep\nsilence.  A fire shall burn before him:  and a mighty tempest shall be\nround about him.","He shall call heaven from above, and the earth, to judge his\npeople.","Gather ye together his saints to him:  who set his covenant before\nsacrifices.","And the heavens shall declare his justice:  for God is judge.","Hear, O my people, and I will speak:  O Israel, and I will testify\nto thee:  I am God, thy God.","I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices:  and thy burnt\nofferings are always in my sight.","I will not take calves out of thy house:  nor he goats out of thy\nflocks.","For all the beasts of the woods are mine:  the cattle on the\nhills, and the oxen.","I know all the fowls of the air:  and with me is the beauty of\nthe field.","If I should be hungry, I would not tell thee:  for the world is\nmine, and the fulness thereof.","Shall I eat the flesh of bullocks?  or shall I drink the blood of\ngoats?","Offer to God the sacrifice of praise:  and pay thy vows to the\nmost High.","And call upon me in the day of trouble:  I will deliver thee, and\nthou shalt glorify me.","But to the sinner God hath said:  Why dost thou declare my\njustices, and take my covenant in thy mouth?","Seeing thou hast hated discipline:  and hast cast my words behind\nthee.","If thou didst see a thief thou didst run with him:  and with\nadulterers thou hast been a partaker.","Thy mouth hath abounded with evil, and thy tongue framed\ndeceits.","Sitting thou didst speak against thy brother, and didst lay a\nscandal against thy mother's son:","These things hast thou done, and I was silent.  Thou thoughtest\nunjustly that I should be like to thee:  but I will reprove thee, and\nset before thy face.","Understand these things, you that forget God; lest he snatch you\naway, and there be none to deliver you.","The sacrifice of praise shall glorify me:  and there is the way\nby which I will shew him the salvation of God."]}
