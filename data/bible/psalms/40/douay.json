{"verses":["Unto the end, a psalm for David himself.","Blessed is he that understandeth concerning the needy and the\npoor:  the Lord will deliver him in the evil day.","The Lord preserve him and give him life, and make him blessed\nupon the earth:  and deliver him not up to the will of his enemies.","The Lord help him on his bed of sorrow:  thou hast turned all his\ncouch in his sickness.","I said:  O Lord, be thou merciful to me:  heal my soul, for I have\nsinned against thee.","My enemies have spoken evils against me:  when shall he die and\nhis name perish?","And if he came in to see me, he spoke vain things:  his heart\ngathered together iniquity to itself.  He went out and spoke to the same\npurpose.","All my enemies whispered together against me:  they devised evils\nto me.","They determined against me an unjust word:  shall he that sleepeth\nrise again no more?","For even the man of my peace, in whom I trusted, who ate my\nbread, hath greatly supplanted me.","But thou, O Lord, have mercy on me, and raise my up again:  and I\nwill requite them.","By this I know, that thou hast had a good will for me:  because\nmy enemy shall not rejoice over me.","But thou hast upheld me by reason of my innocence:  and hast\nestablished me in thy sight for ever.","Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel from eternity to eternity.\nSo be it.  So be it."]}
