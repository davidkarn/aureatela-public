Now the hedgehog is a small animal, very shy, and covered over with thorny bristles. When Jesus was crowned with thorns and bore our sins and suffered for us, it was to make the roses of virginity and the lilies of chastity grow for us out of the brambles and briers which have formed the lot of women since the day when it was said to Eve, \"in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee.\"[fn-51-P5152_1421048:3676-nf] We are told that the bridegroom feeds among the lilies,[fn-51-P5153_1421127:3677-nf] that is, among those who have not defiled their garments, for they have remained virgins[fn-51-P5154_1421239:3678-nf] and have hearkened to the precept of the Preacher: \"let thy garments be always white.\"[fn-51-P5155_1421348:3679-nf] As the author and prince of virginity He says boldly of Himself: \"I am the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valleys.\"[fn-51-P5156_1421492:3680-nf] \"The rocks\" then \"are a refuge for the tonics\" who when they are persecuted in one city flee into another[fn-51-P5157_1421620:3681-nf] and have no fear that the prophetic words \"refuge failed me\"[fn-51-P5158_1421703:3682-nf] will he fulfilled in their case. \"The high hills are a refuge for the wildgoats,\"[fn-51-P5159_1421808:3683-nf] and their food are the serpents which a little child draws out of their holes.

Notwithstanding, he was not approved, both because he asked for no further food of righteousness, as if he were already filled, and because he arrogantly preferred himself to the publican, who was hungering and thirsting after righteousness. What, then, is to be said of those who, whilst acknowledging that they have no righteousness, or no fulness thereof, yet imagine that it is to be had from themselves alone, not to be besought from their Creator, in whom is its store and its fountain?

Yet what we read in the Proverbs of impious men saying, \"Let us unrighteously hide in the earth the righteous man; yea, let us swallow him up alive as hell, and let us take away his memory from the earth: let us seize his precious possession,\"[fn-32-P3229_1772210:137-nf] is not so obscure that it may not be understood, without laborious exposition, of Christ and His possession the Church. Indeed, the gospel parable about the wicked husbandmen shows that our Lord Jesus Himself said something like it: \"This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.\"[fn-32-P3230_1772544:138-nf] In like manner also that passage in this same book, on which we have already touched[fn-32-P3231_1772652:139-nf] when we were speaking of the barren woman who hath born seven, must soon after it was tittered have come to be understood of only Christ and the Church by those who knew that Christ was the Wisdom of God. \"Wisdom hath builded her an house, and hath set up seven pillars; she hath sacrificed her victims, she hath mingled her wine in the bowl; she hath also furnished her table. She hath sent her servants summoning to the bowl with excellent proclamation, saying, Who is simple, let him turn aside to me. And to the void of sense she hath said, Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled for you.\"[fn-32-P3232_1773287:140-nf] Here certainly we perceive that the Wisdom of God, that is, the Word co-eternal with the Father, hath builded Him an house, even a human body in the virgin womb, and hath subjoined the Church to it as members to a head, hath slain the martyrs as victims, hath furnished a table with wine and bread, where appears also the priesthood after the order of Melchizedek, and hath called the simple and the void of sense, because, as saith the apostle, \"He hath chosen the weak things of this world that He might confound the things which are mighty.\"[fn-32-P3233_1773888:141-nf] Yet to these weak ones she saith what follows, \"Forsake simplicity, that ye may live; and seek prudence, that ye may have life.\"[fn-32-P3234_1774039:142-nf] But to be made partakers of this table is itself to begin to have life. For when he says in another book, which is called Ecclesiastes, \"There is no good for a man, except that he should eat and drink,\"[fn-32-P3235_1774262:143-nf] what can he be morecredibly understood to say, than what belongs to the participation of this table which the Mediator of the New Testament Himself, the Priest after the order of Melchizedek, furnishes with His own body and blood? For that sacrifice has succeeded all the sacrifices of the Old Testament, which were slain as a shadow of that which was to come; wherefore also we recognize the voice in the 40th Psalm as that of the same Mediator speaking through prophesy,\" Sacrifice and offering Thou didst not desire; but a body hast Thou perfected for me.\"[fn-32-P3236_1774872:144-nf] Because, instead of all these sacrifices and oblations, His body is offered, and is served up to the partakers of it. For that this Ecclesiastes, in this sentence about eating and drinking, which he often repeats, and very much commends, does not savor the dainties of carnal pleasures, is made plain enough when he says, \"It is better to go into the house of mourning than to go into the house of feasting.\"[fn-32-P3237_1775299:145-nf] And a little after He says, \"The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, and the heart of the simple in the house of feasting.\"[fn-32-P3238_1775458:146-nf] But I think that more worthy of quotation from this book which relates to both cities, the one of the devil, the other of Christ, and to their kings, the devil and Christ: \"Woe to thee, O land,\" he says, \"when thy king is a youth, and thy princes eat in the morning! Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in season, in fortitude, and not in confusion!\"[fn-32-P3239_1775878:147-nf] He has called the devil a youth, because of the folly and pride, and rashness and unruliness, and other vices which are wont to abound at that age; but Christ is the Son of nobles, that is, of the holy patriarchs, of those belonging to the free city, of whom He was begotten in the flesh. The princes of that and other cities are eaters in the morning, that is, before the suitable hour, because they do not expect the seasonable felicity, which is the true, in tile world to come, desiring to be speedily made happy with the renown of this world; but the princes of the city of Christ patiently wait for the time of a blessedness that is not fallacious. This is expressed by the words, \"in fortitude, and not in confusion,\" because hope does not deceive them; of which the apostle says, \"But hope maketh not ashamed.\"[fn-32-P3240_1776724:148-nf] A psalm also saith, \"For they that hope in Thee shall not be put to shame.\"[fn-32-P3241_1776818:149-nf] But now the Song of Songs is a certain spiritual pleasure of holy minds, in the marriage of that King and Queen-city, that is, Christ and the Church.

That, however, is a parable in word, not one embodied in outward action; and just as in the passage before us the Lord indicated by an outward action the kind of character the Church would have in the end of the world, so in the same way, by that other fishing, He indicated its present character. In doing the one at the commencement of His preaching and this latter after His resurrection, He showed thereby in the former case that the capture of fishes signified the good and bad presently existing in the Church; but in the latter, the good only, whom it will contain everlastingly, when the resurrection of the dead shall have been completed in the end of this world. Furthermore, on that previous occasion Jesus stood not, as here, on the shore, when He gave orders for the taking of the fish, but \"entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land; and He sat down therein, and taught the crowds. And when He had left speaking, He said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.\" There also they put the fishes that were caught into the ship, and did not, as here, draw the net to the shore. By these signs, and any others that may be found, on the former occasion the Church was prefigured as it exists in this world, and on the other, as it shall be in the end of the world: the one accordingly took place before, and the other subsequently to the resurrection of the Lord; because there we were signified by Christ as called, and here as raised from the dead. On that occasion the nets are not let down on the right side, that the good alone might not be signified, nor on the left, test the application should be limited to the bad; but without any reference to either side, He says, \"Let down your nets for a draught,\" that we may understand the good and bad as mingled together: while on this He says, \"Cast the net on the right side of the ship,\" to signify those who stood on the right hand, the good alone. There the net was broken on account of the schisms that were meant to be signified; but here, as then there will be no more schisms in that supreme peace of the saints, the evangelist was entitled to say, \"And for all they were so great,\" that is, so large, \"yet was not the net broken;\" as if with reference to the previous time when it was broken, and a commendation of the good that was here in comparison with the evil that preceded. There the multitude of fishes caught was so great, that the two vessels were filled and began to sink,[fn-38-P3852_2119203:10-nf] that is, were weighed down to the point of sinking; for they did not actually sink, but were in extreme jeopardy. For whence exist in the Church the great evils under which we groan, save from the impossibility of withstanding the enormous multitude that, almost to the entire subversion of discipline, gain an entrance, with their morals so utterly at variance with the pathway of the saints? Here, however, they cast the net on the right side, \"and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.\" What is meant by the words, \"Now they were not able to draw it,\" but this, that those who belong to the resurrection of life, that is to say, to the right hand, and depart this life within the nets of the Christian name, will be made manifest only on the shore, in other words, when they shall rise from the dead at the end of the world? Accordingly, they were not able to draw the nets so as to discharge into the vessel the fishes they had caught, as was done with all of those wherewith the net was broken, and the boats laden to sinking. But the Church possesses those right-hand ones after the close of this life in the sleep of peace, lying hid as it were in the deep, till the net reach the shore whither it is being drawn, as it were two hundred cubits. And as on that first occasion it was done by two vessels, with reference to the circumcision and the uncircumcision; so in this place, by the two hundred cubits, I am of opinion that there is symbolized, with reference to the elect of both classes, the circumcision and the uncircumcision, as it were two separate hundreds; because the number that passes to the right hand is represented summarily by hundreds. And last of all, in that former fishing the number of fishes is not expressed, as if the words were there acted on that were uttered by the prophet, \"I have declared and spoken; they are multiplied beyond number:\"[fn-38-P3853_2121124:11-nf] while here there are none beyond calculation, but the definite number of a hundred and fifty and three; and of the reason of this number we must now, with the Lord's help, give some account.","title":"Tractate CXXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":40,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_56_book_v_","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"91","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"38. And in that the Church is thus described in the Song of Songs, \"A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed, a well of living water; thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits;\"[fn-38-P3820_2101304:101-nf] I dare not understand this save of the holy and just,-not of the covetous, and defrauders, and robbers, and usurers, and drunkards, and the envious, of whom we yet both learn most fully from Cyprian's letters, as I have often shown, and teach ourselves, that they had baptism in common with the just, in common with whom they certainly had not Christian charity. For I would that some one would tell me how they \"crept into the garden enclosed and the fountain sealed,\" of whom Cyprian bears witness that they renounced the world in word and not in deed, and that yet they were within the Church. For if they both are themselves there, and are themselves the bride of Christ, can she then be as she is described \"without spot or wrinkle,\"[fn-38-P3821_2102069:102-nf] and is the fair dove defiled with such a portion of her members? Are these the thorns among which she is a lily, as it is said in the same Song?[fn-38-P3822_2102233:103-nf] So far therefore, as the lily extends, so far does \"the garden enclosed and the fountain sealed,\" namely, through all those just persons who are Jews inwardly in the circumcision of the heart[fn-38-P3823_2102444:104-nf] (for\" the king's daughter is all glorious within\"[fn-38-P3824_2102514:105-nf] ), in whom is the fixed number of the saints predestined before the foundation of the world. But that multitude of thorns, whether in secret or in open separation, is pressing on it from without, above number. \"If I would declare them,\" it is said, \"and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.\"[fn-38-P3825_2102840:106-nf] The number, therefore, of the just persons, \"who are the called according to His purpose,\"[fn-38-P3826_2102949:107-nf] of whom it is said, \"The Lord knoweth them that are His,\"[fn-38-P3827_2103029:108-nf] is itself \"the garden enclosed, the fountain sealed, a well of living water, the orchard of pomegranates with pleasant fruits.\" Of this number some live according to the Spirit, and enter on the excellent way of charity; and when they \"restore a man that is overtaken in a fault in the spirit of meekness, they consider themselves, lest they also be tempted.\"[fn-38-P3828_2103411:109-nf] And when it happens that they also are themselves overtaken, the affection of charity is but a little checked, and not extinguished; and again rising up and being kindled afresh, it is restored to its former course. For they know how to say, \"My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto Thy word.\"[fn-38-P3829_2103749:110-nf] But when \"in anything they be otherwise minded, God shallreveal even this unto them,\"[fn-38-P3830_2103856:111-nf] if they abide in the burning flame of charity, and do not break the bond of peace. But some who are yet carnal, and full of fleshly appetites, are instant in working out their progress; and that they may become fit for heavenly food,they are nourished with the milk of the holy mysteries, they avoid in the fear of God whatever is manifestly corrupt even in the opinion of the world, and they strive most watchfully that they may be less and less delighted with worldly and temporal matters. They observe most constantly the rule of faith which has been sought out with diligence; and if in aught they stray from it, they submit to speedy correction under Catholic authority, although, in Cyprian's words, they be tossed about, by reason of their fleshly appetite, with the various conflicts of phantasies. There are some also who as yet live wickedly, or even lie in heresies or the superstitions of the Gentiles, and yet even then \"the Lord knoweth them that are His.\" For, in that unspeakable foreknowledge of God, many who seem to be without are in reality within, and many who seem to be within yet really are without. Of all those, therefore, who, if I may so say, are inwardly and secretly within, is that \"enclosed garden\" composed, \"the fountain sealed, a well of living water, the orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits.\" The divinely imparted gifts of these are partly peculiar to themselves, as in this world the charity that never faileth, and in the world to come eternal life; partly they are common with evil and perverse men, as all the other things in which consist the holy mysteries.","title":"Book V.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":40,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_52_oration_xl_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"49","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"XLIV.

If thy heart is written upon in some other way than as my teaching demands, come and have the writing changed; I am no unskilled caligrapher of these truths.

Moreover, the prophets indicate in the fullest manner that God stood in no need of their slavish obedience, but that it was upon their own account that He enjoined certain observances in the law. And again, that God needed not their oblation, but [merely demanded it], on account of man himself who offers it, the Lord taught distinctly, as I have pointed out. For when He perceived them neglecting righteousness, and abstaining from the love of God, and imagining that God was to be propitiated by sacrifices and the other typical observances, Samuel did even thus speak to them: \"God does not desire whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices, but He will have His voice to be hearkened to. Behold, a ready obedience is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.\"[fn-82-P8292_2307787:210-nf] David also says: \"Sacrifice and oblation Thou didst not desire, but mine ears hast Thou perfected;[fn-82-P8293_2307908:211-nf] burnt-offerings also for sin Thou hast not required.\"[fn-82-P8294_2308398:212-nf] He thus teaches them that God desires obedience, which renders them secure, rather than sacrifices and holocausts, which avail them nothing towards righteousness; and [by this declaration] he prophesies the new covenant at the same time. Still clearer, too, does he speak of these things in the fiftieth Psalm: \"For if Thou hadst desired sacrifice, then would I have given it: Thou wilt not delight in burnt-offerings. The sacrifice of God is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart the Lord will not despise.\"[fn-82-P8295_2308932:213-nf] Because, therefore, God stands in need of nothing, He declares in the preceding Psalm: \"I will take no calves out of thine house, nor he-goats out of thy fold. For Mine are all the beasts of the earth, the herds and the oxen on the mountains: I know all the fowls of heaven, and the various tribes[fn-82-P8296_2309249:214-nf] of the field are Mine.

Shall I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? \"[fn-82-P8297_2309458:215-nf] Then, lest it might be supposed that He refused these things in His anger, He continues, giving him (man) counsel: \"Offer unto God the sacrifice of praise, and pay thy vows to the Most High; and call upon Me in the day of thy trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me; \"[fn-82-P8298_2309765:216-nf] rejecting, indeed, those things by which sinners imagined they could propitiate God, and showing that He does Himself stand in need of nothing; but He exhorts and advises them to those. things by which man is justified and draws nigh to God. This same declaration does Esaias make: \"To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto Me? saith the Lord. I am full.\"[fn-82-P8299_2310160:217-nf] And when He had repudiated holocausts, and sacrifices, and oblations, as likewise the new moons, and the sabbaths, and the festivals, and all the rest of the services accompanying these, He continues, exhorting them to what pertained to salvation: \"Wash you, make you clean, take away wickedness from your hearts from before mine eyes: cease from your evil ways, learn to do well, seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow; and come, let us reason together, saith the Lord.\"","title":"Book IV.","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":40,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_62_book_iii_","source_chapter":49,"source_paragraph":"168","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"59. Do not therefore any longer say, \"The conscience of one that gives in holiness is what we look for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient,\" lest you be asked, When a stain on the conscience of the giver is concealed, who cleanses the conscience of the recipient? And when you shall have answered, Either God or an angel (since there is no other answer which you possibly can make), then should follow a consequence whereby you would be confounded: Those then are justified with greater holiness who are baptized by undetected evil men, so as to be cleansed by God or by an angel, than those who are baptized by men who are genuinely and manifestly good, who cannot be compared with God or with the angels. But prevail upon yourselves to say what is said by Truth and by the Catholic Church, that not only when the minister of baptism is evil, but also when he is holy and good, hope is still not to be placed in man, but in Him that justifieth the ungodly, in whom if any man believe, his faith is counted for righteousness.[fn-57-P5795_2802999:105-nf] For when we say, Christ baptizes, we do not mean by a visible ministry, as Petilianus believes, or would have men think that he believes, to be our meaning, but by a hidden grace, by a hidden power in the Holy Spirit as it is said of Him by John the Baptist, \"The same is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-57-P5796_2803331:106-nf] Nor has He, as Petilianus says, now ceased to baptize; but He still does it, not by any ministry of the body, but by the invisible working of His majesty. For in that we say, He Himself baptizes, we do not mean, He Himself holds and dips in the water the bodies of the believers; but He Himself invisibly cleanses, and that He does to the whole Church without exception. Nor, indeed, may we refuse to believe the words of the Apostle Paul who says concerning Him, \"Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the Church, and gave Himself for it, that He might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word.\"[fn-57-P5797_2803983:107-nf] Here you see that Christ sanctifies; here you see that Christ also Himself washes, Himself purifies with the self-same washing of water by the word, wherein the ministers are seen to do their work in the body. Let no one, therefore, claim unto himself what is of God. The hope of men is only sure when it is fixed on Him who cannot deceive, since \"Cursed be every one that trusteth in man,\"[fn-57-P5798_2804397:108-nf] and \"Blessed is that man that maketh the Lord His trust.\"[fn-57-P5799_2804476:109-nf] For the faithful steward shall receive as his reward eternal life; but the unfaithful steward, when he dispenses his lord's provisions to his fellow-servants, must in no wise be conceived to make the provisions useless by his own unfaithfulness. For the Lord says, \"Whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works.\"[fn-58-P5800_2804848:110-nf] And this is therefore the injunction that is given us against evil stewards, that the good things of God should be received at their hands, but that we should beware of their own evil life, by reason of its unlikeness to what they thus dispense.","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":40,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_44_defence_of_his_flight","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"72","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"The flight of the saints therefore was neither blameable nor unprofitable.
