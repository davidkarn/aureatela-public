{"verses":["To thee have I lifted up my eyes, who dwellest in heaven.","Behold as the eyes of servants are on the hands of their\nmasters, As the eyes of the handmaid are on the hands of her mistress:\nso are our eyes unto the Lord our God, until he have mercy on us.","Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us:  for we are greatly\nfilled with contempt.","For our soul is greatly filled:  we are a reproach to the rich,\nand contempt to the proud."]}
