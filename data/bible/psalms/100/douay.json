{"verses":["A psalm for David himself.  Mercy and judgment I will sing to\nthee, O Lord:  I will sing,","And I will understand in the unspotted way, when thou shalt come\nto me.  I walked in the innocence of my heart, in the midst of my house.","I will not set before my eyes any unjust thing:  I hated the\nworkers of iniquities.","The perverse heart did not cleave to me:  and the malignant, that\nturned aside from me, I would not know.","The man that in private detracted his neighbour, him did I\npersecute.  With him that had a proud eye, and an unsatiable heart, I\nwould not eat.","My eyes were upon the faithful of the earth, to sit with me:  the\nman that walked in the perfect way, he served me.","He that worketh pride shall not dwell in the midst of my house:\nhe that speaketh unjust things did not prosper before my eyes.","In the morning I put to death all the wicked of the land:  that I\nmight cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of the Lord."]}
