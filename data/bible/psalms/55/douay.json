{"verses":["Unto the end, for a people that is removed at a distance form the\nsanctuary:  for David, for an inscription of a title (or pillar) when\nthe Philistines held him in Geth.","Have mercy on me, O God, for man hath trodden me under foot; all\nthe day long he hath afflicted me fighting against me.","My enemies have trodden on me all the day long; for they are many\nthat make war against me.","From the height of the day I shall fear:  but I will trust in\nthee.","In God I will praise my words, in God I have put my trust:  I will\nnot fear what flesh can do against me.","All the day long they detested my words:  all their thoughts were\nagainst me unto evil.","They will dwell and hide themselves:  they will watch my heel.  As\nthey have waited for my soul,","For nothing shalt thou save them:  in thy anger thou shalt break\nthe people in pieces.  O God,","I have declared to thee my life:  thou hast set me tears in thy\nsight, As also in thy promise.","Then shall my enemies be turned back.  In what day soever I shall\ncall upon thee, behold I know thou art my God.","In God will I praise the word, in the Lord will I praise his\nspeech.  In God have I hoped, I will not fear what man can do to me.","In me, O God, are vows to thee, which I will pay, praises to\nthee:","Because thou hast delivered my soul from death, my feet from\nfalling:  that I may please in the sight of God, in the light of the\nliving."]}
