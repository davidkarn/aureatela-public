{"verses":["Unto the end, a psalm for David himself.","With expectation I have waited for the Lord, and he was attentive\nto me.","And he heard my prayers, and brought me out of the pit of misery\nand the mire of dregs.  And he set my feet upon a rock, and directed my\nsteps.","And he put a new canticle into my mouth, a song to our God.  Many\nshall see, and shall fear:  and they shall hope in the Lord.","Blessed is the man whose trust is in the name of the Lord; and\nwho hath not had regard to vanities, and lying follies.","Thou hast multiplied thy wonderful works, O Lord my God:  and in\nthy thoughts there is no one like to thee.  I have declared and I have\nspoken they are multiplied above number.","Sacrifice and oblation thou didst not desire; but thou hast\npierced ears for me.  Burnt offering and sin offering thou didst not\nrequire:","Then said I, Behold I come.  In the head of the book it is written\nof me","That I should do thy will:  O my God, I have desired it, and thy\nlaw in the midst of my heart.","I have declared thy justice in a great church, lo, I will not\nrestrain my lips:  O Lord, thou knowest it.","I have not hid thy justice within my heart:  I have declared thy\ntruth and thy salvation.  I have not concealed thy mercy and thy truth\nfrom a great council.","Withhold not thou, O Lord, thy tender mercies from me:  thy mercy\nand thy truth have always upheld me.","For evils without number have surrounded me; my iniquities have\novertaken me, and I was not able to see.  They are multiplied above the\nhairs of my head:  and my heart hath forsaken me.","Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me.  look down, O Lord, to help\nme.","Let them be confounded and ashamed together, that seek after my\nsoul to take it away.  Let them be turned backward and be ashamed that\ndesire evils to me.","Let them immediately bear their confusion, that say to me:  'T is\nwell, t' is well.","Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee:  and let such\nas love thy salvation say always:  The Lord be magnified.","But I am a beggar and poor:  the Lord is careful for me.  Thou art\nmy helper and my protector:  O my God, be not slack."]}
