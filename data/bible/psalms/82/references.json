Similar evidence has been collected also concerning the Holy Spirit, of which those who have discussed the subject before ourselves have most fully availed themselves, that He too is God, and not a creature. But if not a creature, then not only God (for men likewise are called gods[fn-2-P238_83452:44-nf] ), but also very God; and therefore absolutely equal with the Father and the Son, and in the unity of the Trinity consubstantial and co-eternal. But that the Holy Spirit is not a creature is made quite plain by that passage above all others, where we are commanded not to serve the creature, but the Creator;[fn-2-P239_83782:45-nf] not in the sense in which we are commanded to \"serve\" one another by love,[fn-2-P240_83874:46-nf] which is in Greek douleuein, but in that in which God alone is served, which is in Greek latreuein. From whence they are called idolaters who tender that service to images which is due to God. For it is this service concerning which it is said, \"Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.\"[fn-2-P241_84207:47-nf] For this is found also more distinctly in the Greek Scriptures, which have latreuseij. Now if we are forbidden to serve the creature with such a service, seeing that it is written, \"Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve\" (and hence, too, the apostle repudiates those who worship and serve the creature more than the Creator), then assuredly the Holy Spirit is not a creature, to whom such a service is paid by all the saints; as says the apostle, \"For we are the circumcision, which serve the Spirit of God,\"[fn-2-P242_84764:48-nf] which is in the Greek latreuontej. For even most Latin copies also have it thus, \"We who serve the Spirit of God;\" but all Greek ones, or almost all, have it so. Although in some Latin copies we find, not \"We worship the Spirit of God,\" but, \"We worship God in the Spirit.\" But let those who err in this case, and refuse to give up to the more weighty authority, tell us whether they find this text also varied in the mss.: \"Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which ye have of God?\" Yet what can be more senseless or more profane, than that any one should dare to say that the members of Christ are the temple of one who, in their opinion, is a creature inferior to Christ? For the apostle says in another place, \"Your bodies are members of Christ.\" But if the members of Christ are also the temple of the Holy Spirit, then the Holy Spirit is not a creature; because we must needs owe to Him, of whom our body is the temple, that service wherewith God only is to be served, which in Greek is called latreia. And accordingly the apostle says, \"Therefore glorify God in your body.\"[fn-2-P243_85922:49-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":82,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_06_tractate_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"4. But those who received peace to proclaim it to the people have made Wisdom herself an object of contemplation, so far as human hearts could lay hold on that which \"eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither has ascended into the heart of man.\"[fn-2-P216_10522:5-nf] If it has not ascended into the heart of man, how has it ascended into the heart of John? Was not John a man? Or perhaps neither into John's heart did it ascend, but John's heart ascended into it? For that which ascends into the heart of man is from beneath, to man; but that to which the heart of man ascends is above, from man. Even so brethren, can it be said that, if it ascended into the heart of John (if in any way it can be said), it ascended into his heart in so far as he was not man. What means \"was not man\"? In so far as he had begun to be an angel. For all saints are angels, since they are messengers of God.

From this usage it has also come to pass that God Himself is called, pious,[fn-15-P1597_903578:6-nf] in which sense the Greeks never use eu0sebei=n, though eu0se/beiais applied to works of charity by their common people also. In some passages of Scripture, therefore, they have sought to preserve the distinction by using not eise/beia, the more general word, but qeose/beia, which literally denotes. the worship of God. We, on the other hand, cannot express either of these ideas by one word. This worship, then, which in Greek is called latrei/a, and in Latin \"servitus\" [service], but the service due to God only; this worship, which in Greek is called qrhskei/a, and in Latin \"religio,\" but the religion by which we are bound to God only; this worship, which they call qeose/beia, but which we cannot express in one word, but call it the worship of God,-this, we say, belongs only to that God who is the true God, and who makes His worshippers gods.[fn-15-P1598_904481:7-nf] And therefore, whoever these immortal and blessed inhabitants of heaven be, if they do not love us, and wish us to be blessed, then we ought not to worship them; and if they do love us and desire our happiness, they cannot wish us to be made happy by any other means than they themselves have enjoyed,-for how could they wish our blessedness to flow from one source, theirs from another?","title":"Book X","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":82,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_109_sermon_xcii_cxlii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"4.

This is a foolish objection; and my answer to it is, that its author fails to consider that quite as strong an objection might be urged against the (superior) god of Marcion: he too is called god, but is not on that account proved to be divine, as neither are angels nor men, the Creator's handwork. If an identity of names affords a presumption in support of equality of condition, how often do worthless menials strut insolently in the names of kings-your Alexanders, Cµsars, and Pompeys![fn-39-P3912_1290230:84-nf] This fact, however, does not detract from the real attributes of the royal persons, Nay more, the very idols of the Gentiles are called gods. Yet not one of them is divine because he is called a god. It is not, therefore, for the name of god, for its sound or its written form, that I am claiming the supremacy in the Creator, but for the essence[fn-39-P3913_1290664:85-nf] to which the name belongs; and when I find that essence alone is unbegotten and unmade-alone eternal, and the maker of all things-it is not to its name, but its state, not to its designation, but its condition, that I ascribe and appropriate the attribute of the supremacy. And so, because the essence to which I ascribe it has come[fn-39-P3914_1291015:86-nf] to be called god, you suppose that I ascribe it to the name, because I must needs use a name to express the essence, of which indeed that Being consists who is called God, and who is accounted the great Supreme because of His essence, not from His name. In short, Marcion himself, when he imputes this character to his god, imputes it to the nature,[fn-39-P3915_1291387:87-nf] not to the word. That supremacy, then, which we ascribe to God in consideration of His essence, and not because of His name, ought, as we maintain, to be equal[fn-39-P3916_1291560:88-nf] in both the beings who consist of that substance for which the name of God is given; because, in as far as they are called gods (i.e. supreme beings, on the strength, of course, of their unbegotten and eternal, and therefore great and supreme essence), in so far the attribute of being the great Supreme cannot be regarded as less or worse in one than in another great Supreme. If the happiness, and sublimity, and perfection[fn-39-P3917_1292000:89-nf] of the Supreme Being shall hold good of Marcion's god, it will equally so of ours; and if not of ours, it will equally not hold of Marcion's. Therefore two supreme beings will be neither equal nor unequal: not equal, because the principle which we have just expounded, that the Surpeme Being admits of no comparison with Himself, forbids it; not unequal, because another principle meets us respecting the Supreme Being, that He is capable of no diminution. So, Marcion, you are caught[fn-39-P3918_1292500:90-nf] in the midst of your own Pontic tide. The waves of truth overwhelm you on every side. You can neither set up equal gods nor unequal ones.

Alas for the idle and irrational tenets! Now for the first time we have heard this piece of vain babbling,-that the Lord, by Whom are all things, does not in a strict sense exist. And we have not yet got to the end of this appalling statement; but something yet more startling remains behind, that he not only affirms that He does not exist, or does not strictly speaking exist, but also that the Nature in which He is conceived to reside is various and composite. For he says \"not being, or not being simple.\" But that to which simplicity does not belong is manifestly various and composite. How then can the same Person be at once non-existent and composite in essence? For one of two alternatives they must choose: if they predicate of Him non-existence they cannot speak of Him as composite, or if they affirm Him to be composite they cannot rob Him of existence. But that their blasphemy may assume many and varied shapes, it jumps at every godless notion when it wishes to contrast Him with the existent, affirming that, strictly speaking, He does not exist, and in His relation to the uncompounded Nature denying Him the attribute of simplicity:-\"not existing, not existing simply, not existing in the strict sense.\" Who among those who have transgressed the word and forsworn the Faith was ever so lavish in utterances denying the Lord? He has stood up in rivalry with the divine proclamation of John. For as often as the latter has attested \"was\" of the Word, so often does he apply to Him Who is an opposing \"was not.\" And he contends against the holy lips of our father Basil, bringing against him the charge that he \"neglects these distinctions,\" when he says that He Who is in the Father, and in the beginning, and in the bosom of the Father, exists, holding the view that the addition of \"in the beginning,\" and \"in the bosom of the Father,\" bars the real existence of Him Who is. Vain learning! What things the teachers of deceit teach! what strange doctrines they introduce to their hearers! they instruct them that that which is in something else does not exist! So, Eunomius, since your heart and brain are within you, neither of them, according to your distinction, exists. For if the Only-begotten God does not, strictly speaking, exist, for this reason, that He is in the bosom of the Father, then everything that is in something else is thereby excluded from existence. But certainly your heart exists in you, and not independently; therefore, according to your view, you must either say that it does not exist at all, or that it does not exist in the strict sense. However, the ignorance and profanity of his language are so gross and so glaring, as to be obvious even before our argument, at all events to all persons of sense: but that his folly as well as his impiety may be more manifest, we will add thus much to what has gone before. If one may only say that that in the strict sense exists, of which the word of Scripture attests the existence detached from all relation to anything else, why do they, like those who carry water, perish with thirst when they have it in their power to drink? Even this man, though he had at hand the antidote to his blasphemy against the Son, closed his eyes and ran past it as though fearing to be saved, and charges Basil with unfairness for having suppressed the qualifying words, and for only quoting the \"was\" by itself, in reference to the Only-Begotten. And yet it was quite in his power to see what Basil saw and what every one who has eyes sees. And herein the sublime John seems to me to have been prophetically moved, that the mouths of those fighters against Christ might be stopped, who on the ground of these additions deny the existence, in the strict sense, of the Christ, saying simply and without qualification \"The Word was God,\" and was Life, and was Light[fn-19-P1983_1192446:29-nf] , not merely speaking of Him as being in the beginning, and with God, and in the bosom of the Father, so that by their relation the absolute existence of the Lord should be done away. But his assertion that He was God, by this absolute declaration detached from alI relation to anything else, cuts off every subterfuge from those who in their reasonings run into impiety; and, in addition to this, there is moreover something else which still more convincingly proves the malignity of our adversaries. For if they make out that to exist in something is an indication of not existing in the strict sense, then certainly they allow that not even the Father exists absolutely, as they have learnt in the Gospel, that just as the Son abides in the Father, so the Father abides in the Son, according to the words of the Lord[fn-19-P1984_1193300:30-nf] . For to say that the Father is in the Son is equivalent to saying that the Son is in the bosom of the Father. And in passing let us make this further inquiry. When the Son, as they say, \"was not,\" what did the bosom of the Father contain? For assuredly they must either grant that it was full, or suppose it to have been empty. If then the bosom was full, certainly the Son was that which filled the bosom. But if they imagine that there was some void in the bosom of the Father, they do nothing else than assert of Him perfection by way of augmentation, in the sense that He passed from the state of void and deficiency to the state of fulness and perfection. But \"they knew not nor understood,\" says David of those that \"walk on still in darkness[fn-19-P1985_1194072:31-nf] .\" For he who has been rendered hostile to the true Light cannot keep his soul in light. For this reason it was that they did not perceive lying ready to their hand in logical sequence that which would have corrected their impiety, smitten, as it were, with blindness, like the men of Sodom.","title":"Book X","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":82,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_27_introductory_notice_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"61","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"16.

And again He says: \"Behold, my servants shall be filled, but ye shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty.\"[fn-57-P5755_1750199:478-nf] As for these oppositions, we shall see whether they are not premonitors of Christ.[fn-57-P5756_1750303:479-nf] Meanwhile the promise of fulness to the hungry is a provision of God the Creator. \"Blessed are they that weep, for they shall laugh.\"[fn-57-P5757_1750473:480-nf] Turn again to the passage of Isaiah: \"Behold, my servants shall exult with joy, but ye shall be ashamed; behold, my servants shall be glad, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart.\"[fn-57-P5758_1750672:481-nf] And recognise these oppositions also in the dispensation of Christ. Surely gladness and joyous exultation is promised to those who are in an opposite condition-to the sorrowful, and sad, and anxious. Just as it is said in the 125th Psalm: \"They who sow in tears shall reap in joy.\"[fn-57-P5759_1750979:482-nf] Moreover, laughter is as much an accessory to the exulting and glad, as weeping is to the sorrowful and grieving. Therefore the Creator, in foretelling matters for laughter and tears, was the first who said that those who mourned should laugh. Accordingly, He who began (His course) with consolation for the poor, and the humble, and the hungry, and the weeping, was at once eager[fn-57-P5760_1751437:483-nf] to represent Himself as Him whom He had pointed out by the mouth of Isaiah: \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the poor.\"[fn-57-P5761_1751633:484-nf] \"Blessed are the needy, because theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\"[fn-57-P5762_1751719:485-nf] \"He hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted.\"[fn-57-P5763_1751788:486-nf] \"Blessed are they that hunger, for they shall be filled.\"[fn-57-P5764_1751866:487-nf] \"To comfort all that mourn.\"[fn-57-P5765_1751915:488-nf] \"Blessed are they that weep, for they shall laugh.\"[fn-57-P5766_1751987:489-nf] \"To give unto them that mourn in Sion, beauty (or glory) for ashes, and the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.\"[fn-57-P5767_1752164:490-nf] Now since Christ, as soon as He entered on His course,[fn-57-P5768_1752239:491-nf] fulfilled such a ministration as this, He is either, Himself, He who predicted His own coming to do all this; or else if he is not yet come who predicted this, the charge to Marcion's Christ must be a ridiculous one (although I should perhaps add a necessary[fn-57-P5769_1752522:492-nf] one), which bade him say, \"Blessed shall ye be, when men shall bate you, and shall reproach you, and shall cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.\"[fn-57-P5770_1752754:493-nf] In this declaration there is, no doubt, an exhortation to patience. Well, what did the Creator say otherwise by Isaiah? \"Fear ye not the reproach of men, nor be diminished by their contempt.\"[fn-57-P5771_1752966:494-nf] What reproach? what contempt? That which was to be incurred for the sake of the Son of man. What Son of man? He who (is come) according to the Creator's will. Whence shall we get our proof? From the very cutting off, which was predicted against Him; as when He says by Isaiah to the Jews, who were the instigators of hatred against Him: \"Because of you, my name is blasphemed amongst the Gentiles; \"[fn-57-P5772_1753400:495-nf] and in another passage: \"Lay the penalty on[fn-57-P5773_1753464:496-nf] Him who surrenders[fn-57-P5774_1753499:497-nf] His own life, who is held in contempt by the Gentiles, whether servants or magistrates.\"[fn-57-P5775_1753610:498-nf] Now, since hatred was predicted against that Son of man who has His mission from the Creator, whilst the Gospel testifies that the name of Christians, as derived from Christ, was to be hated for the Son of man's sake, because He is Christ, it determines the point that that was the Son of man in the matter of hatred who came according to the Creator's purpose, and against whom the hatred was predicted. And even if He had not yet come, the hatred of His name which exists at the present day could not in any case have possibly preceded Him who was to bear the name.[fn-57-P5776_1754316:499-nf] But He has both suffered the penalty[fn-57-P5777_1754378:500-nf] in out presence, and surrendered His life, laying it down for our sakes, and is held in contempt by the Gentiles. And He who was born (into the world) will be that very Son of man on whose account our name also is rejected.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":82,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_23_book_i_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"74","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"40.

God ever exists; is not Matter, too, ever existent? Both are without beginning; both are without end; both are the authors of the universe-both He who created it, and the Matter of which He made it. For it is impossible that Matter should not be regarded as the author[fn-82-P8232_2332443:52-nf] of all things, when the universe is composed of it. What answer will he give? Will he say that Matter is not then comparable with God as soon as[fn-82-P8233_2332602:53-nf] it has something belonging to God; since, by not having total (divinity), it cannot correspond to the whole extent of the comparison? But what more has he reserved for God, that he should not seem to have accorded to Matter the full amount of the Deity?[fn-82-P8234_2332872:54-nf] He says in reply, that even though this is the prerogative of Matter, both the authority and the substance of God must remain intact, by virtue of which He is regarded as the sole and prime Author, as well as the Lord of all things. Truth, however, maintains the unity of God in such a way as to insist that whatever belongs to God Himself belongs to Him alone. For so will it belong to Himself if it belong to Him alone; and therefore it will be impossible that another god should be admitted, when it is permitted to no other being to possess anything of God. Well, then, you say, we ourselves at that rate possess nothing of God. But indeed we do, and shall continue to do-only it is from Him that we receive it, and not from ourselves.

But what inconsistency is it for him[fn-82-P8239_2334323:59-nf] to allow that there is a conjoint possession of an attribute with God, and also to wish that what he does not refuse to Matter should be, after all, the exclusive privilege of God!","title":"Against Hermogenes.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":82,"verse":5,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_38_book_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"71","folder":"ANF-10","text":"\"And[fn-65-P6551_1121903:69-nf] the light shineth in darkness and the darkness hath not overtaken it.\" We are still enquiring about the light of men, since it is what was spoken of in the preceding verse, and also, I consider, about darkness, which is named as its adversary, the darkness also being, if the definition of it is correct, that of men. The light of men is a generic notion covering two special things; and with the darkness of men it is the same. He who has gained the light of men and shares its beams will do the work of light and know in the higher sense, being illuminated by the light of the higher knowledge. And we must recognize the analogous case of those on the other side, and of their evil actions, and of that which is thought to be bat is not really knowledge, since those who exercise it have the reason (Logos) not of light but of darkness. And because the sacred word knows the things which produce light, isaiah says:[fn-65-P6552_1122832:70-nf] \"Because Thy commandments are a light upon the earth,\" and David says in the Psalm,[fn-65-P6553_1122930:71-nf] \"The precept of the Lord is clear, enlightening the eyes.\" But since in addition to the commandments and the precepts there is a light of higher knowledge, we read in one of the twelve (prophets),[fn-65-P6554_1123140:72-nf] \"Sow to yourselves for righteousness, reap to yourselves for the fruit of life, make light for yourselves the light of knowledge.\" There is a further light of knowledge in addition to the commandments, and so we read, \"Make light for yourselves,\" not simply light, but what light?-the light of knowledge. For if any light that a man kindles for himself were a light of knowledge, then the added words, \"Make light for yourselves, the light of knowledge,\" would have no meaning. And again that darkness is brought upon men by their evil deeds, we learn from John himself, when he says in his epistle,[fn-65-P6555_1123759:73-nf] \"If we say that we have fellowship with Him and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the truth,\" and again, \"He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now,\" and again, \"He that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because darkness hath blinded his eyes.\" Walking in darkness signifies evil conduct, and to hate one's brother, is not that to fall away from that which is properly called knowledge? But he also who is ignorant of divine things walks in darkness, just because of that ignorance; as David says,[fn-65-P6556_1124394:74-nf] \"They knew not, they understood not, they walk in darkness.\" Consider, however, this passage,[fn-65-P6557_1124508:75-nf] \"God is light and in Him is no[fn-65-P6558_1124557:76-nf] darkness,\" and see if the reason for this saying is not that darkness is not one, being either two, because there are two kinds of it, or many, because it is taken distributively, individually with reference to the many evil actions and the many false doctrines; so that there are many darknesses, not one of which is in God. The saying of the Saviour could not be spoken of the Holy One, \"Ye are the light of the world; \"for the Holy One is light of the world (absolute, not particular), and there is not in Him any darkness.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":82,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"62","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Well then, you reply, if He was God who spoke, and He was also God who created, at this rate, one God spoke and another created; (and thus) two Gods are declared. If you are so venturesome and harsh, reflect a while; and that you may think the better and more deliberately, listen to the psalm in which Two are described as God: \"Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; the sceptre of Thy kingdom is a sceptre of righteousness. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity: therefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee or made Thee His Christ.\"[fn-105-P10556_2961814:140-nf] Now, since He here speaks to God, and affirms that God is anointed by God, He must have affirmed that Two are God, by reason of the sceptre's royal power. Accordingly, Isaiah also says to the Person of Christ: \"The Sabµans, men of stature, shall pass over to Thee; and they shall follow after Thee, bound in fetters; and they shall worship Thee, because God is in Thee: for Thou art our God, yet we knew it not; Thou art the God of Israel.\"[fn-105-P10557_2962277:141-nf] For here too, by saying, \"God is in Thee, and \"Thou art God,\" he sets forth Two who were God: (in the former expression in Thee, he means) in Christ, and (in the other he means) the Holy Ghost. That is a still grander statement which you will find expressly made in the Gospel: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\"[fn-105-P10558_2962669:142-nf] There was One \"who was,\" and there was another \"with whom\" He was. But I find in Scripture the name Lord also applied to them Both: \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on my right hand.\"[fn-105-P10559_2962876:143-nf] And Isaiah says this: \"Lord, who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? \"[fn-105-P10560_2963000:144-nf] Now he would most certainly have said Thine Arm, if he had not wished us to understand that the Father is Lord, and the Son also is Lord. A much more ancient testimony we have also in Genesis: \"Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.\"[fn-105-P10561_2963315:145-nf] Now, either deny that this is Scripture; or else (let me ask) what sort of man you are, that you do not think words ought to be taken and understood in the sense in which they are written, especially when they are not expressed in allegories and parables, but in determinate and simple declarations? If, indeed, you follow those who did not at the time endure the Lord when showing Himself to be the Son of God, because they would not believe Him to be the Lord, then (I ask you)call to mind along with them the passage where it is written, \"I have said, Ye are gods, and ye are children of the Most High; \"[fn-105-P10562_2963944:146-nf] and again, \"God standeth in the congregation of gods; \"[fn-105-P10563_2964022:147-nf] in order that, if the Scripture has not been afraid to designate as gods human beings, who have become sons of God by faith, you may be sure that the same Scripture has with greater propriety conferred the name of the Lord on the true and one-only Son of God. Very well! you say, I shall challenge you to preach from this day forth (and that, too, on the authority of these same Scriptures) two Gods and two Lords, consistently with your views. God forbid, (is my reply.) For we, who by the grace of God possess an insight into both the times and the occasions of the Sacred Writings, especially we who are followers of the Paraclete, not of human teachers, do indeed definitively declare that Two Beings are God, the Father and the Son, and, with the addition of the Holy Spirit, even Three, according to the principle of the divine economy, which introduces number, in order that the Father may not, as you perversely infer, be Himself believed to have been born and to have suffered, which it is not lawful to believe, forasmuch as it has not been so handed down. That there are, however, two Gods or two Lords, is a statement which at no time proceeds out of our mouth: not as if it were untrue that the Father is God, and the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God, and each is God; but because in earlier times Two were actually spoken of as God, and two as Lord, that when Christ should come He might be both acknowledged as God and designated as Lord, being the Son of Him who is both God and Lord. Now, if there were found in the Scriptures but one Personality of Him who is God and Lord, Christ would justly enough be inadmissible to the title of God and Lord: for (in the Scriptures) there was declared to be none other than One God and One Lord, and it must have followed that the Father should Himself seem to have come down (to earth), inasmuch as only One God and One Lord was ever read of (in the Scriptures), and His entire Economy would be involved in obscurity, which has been planned and arranged with so clear a foresight in His providential dispensation as matter for our faith. As soon, however, as Christ came, and was recognised by us as the very Being who had from the beginning[fn-105-P10564_2966241:148-nf] caused plurality[fn-105-P10565_2966272:149-nf] (in the Divine Economy), being the second from the Father, and with the Spirit the third, and Himself declaring and manifesting the Father more fully (than He had ever been before), the title of Him who is God and Lord was at once restored to the Unity (of the Divine Nature), even because the Gentiles would have to pass from the multitude of their idols to the One Only God, in order that a difference might be distinctly settled between the worshippers of One God and the votaries of polytheism. For it was only right that Christians should shine in the world as \"children of light,\" adoring and invoking Him who is the One God and Lord as \"the light of the world.\" Besides, if, from that perfect knowledge[fn-105-P10566_2966998:150-nf] which assures us that the title of God and Lord is suitable both to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, we were to invoke a plurality of gods and lords, we should quench our torches, and we should become less courageous to endure the martyr's sufferings, from which an easy escape would everywhere lie open to us, as soon as we swore by a plurality of gods and lords, as sundry heretics do, who hold more gods than One. I will therefore not speak of gods at all, nor of lords, but I shall follow the apostle; so that if the Father and the Son, are alike to be invoked, I shall call the Father \"God,\" and invoke Jesus Christ as \"Lord.\"[fn-105-P10567_2967668:151-nf] But when Christ alone (is mentioned), I shall be able to call Him \"God,\" as the same apostle says: \"Of whom is Christ, who is over all, God blessed for ever.\"[fn-105-P10568_2967845:152-nf] For I should give the name of\" sun\" even to a sunbeam, considered in itself; but if I were mentioning the sun from which the ray emanates, I certainly should at once withdraw the name of sun from the mere beam.

These three there are, and thou canst find nothing whereby human cupidity can be tempted, but either by the lust of the flesh, or the lust of the eyes, or the pride of life. By these three was the Lord tempted of the devil.[fn-41-P4128_2256054:61-nf] By the lust of the flesh He was tempted when it was said to Him, \"If thou be the Son of God, speak to these stones that they become bread,\" when He hungered after His fast. But in what way repelled He the tempter, and taught his soldier how to fight? Mark what He said to him: \"Not by bread alone doth man live, but by every word of God.\" He was tempted also by the lust of the eyes concerning a miracle, when he said to Him, \"Cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.\" He resisted the tempter, for to do the miracle, would only have been to seem either to have yielded, or to have done it from curiosity; for He wrought when He would, as God, howbeit as healing the weak. For if He had done it then, He might have been thought to wish only to do a miracle. But lest men should think this, mark what He answered; and when the like temptation shall happen to thee, say thou also the same: \"Get thee behind me, Satan; for it is written, Thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God:\" that is, if I do this I shall tempt God. He said what He would have thee to say. When the enemy suggests to thee, \"What sort of man, what sort of Christian, art thou? As yet hast thou done one miracle, or by thy prayers have the dead been raised, or hast thou healed the fevered? if thou wert truly of any moment, thou wouldest do some miracle:\" answer and say: \"It is written, Thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God:\" therefore I will not tempt God, as if I should belong to God if I do a miracle, and not belong if I do none: and what becomes then of His words, \"Rejoice, because your names are written in heaven\"? By \"pride of life\" how was the Lord tempted? When he carried Him up to an high place, and said to Him, \"All these will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.\" By the loftiness of an earthly kingdom he wished to tempt the King of all worlds: but the Lord who made heaven and earth trod the devil under foot. What great matter for the devil to be conquered by the Lord? Then what did He in the answer He made to the devil but teach thee the answer He would have thee to make? \"It is, written, Thou shall worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shall thou serve.\" Holding these things fast, ye shall not have the concupiscence of the world: by not having concupiscence of the world, neither shall the lust of the flesh, nor the lust of the eyes, nor the pride of life, subjugate you: and ye shall make place for Charity when she cometh, that ye may love God. Because if love of the world be there, love of God will not be there. Hold fast rather the love of God, that as God is for ever and ever, so ye also may remain for ever and ever: because such is each one as is his love. Lovest thou earth, thou shall be earth.

If the latter, there is some addition He requires yet to make. But for Him to make any addition to His knowledge is absurd, since He is God. For none can be superior to the Word, or the teacher of the only Teacher. Will they not then own, though reluctant, that the perfect Word born of the perfect Father was begotten in perfection, according to oeconomic fore-ordination?

Well, I assert, simultaneously with His baptism by John, He becomes perfect? Manifestly. He did not then learn anything more from him? Certainly not. But He is perfected by the washing-of baptism-alone, and is sanctified by the descent of the Spirit? Such is the case. The same also takes place in our case, whose exemplar Christ became. Being baptized, we are illuminated; illuminated, we become sons; being made sons, we are made perfect; being made perfect, we are made immortal. \"I,\" says He, \"have said that ye are gods, and all sons of the Highest.\"[fn-33-P3378_1012409:50-nf] This work is variously called grace,[fn-33-P3379_1012466:51-nf] and illumination, and perfection, and washing: washing, by which we cleanse away our sins; grace, by which the penalties accruing to transgressions are remitted; and illumination, by which that holy light of salvation is beheld, that is, by which we see God clearly. Now we call that perfect which wants nothing. For what is yet wanting to him who knows God? For it were truly monstrous that that which is not complete should be called a gift (or act) of God's grace. Being perfect, He consequently bestows perfect gifts. As at His command all things were made, so on His bare wishing to bestow grace, ensues the perfecting of His grace.

For if, since all heavenly things, earthly things, and things under the earth, are subjected to Christ, even the angels themselves, with all other creatures, as many as are subjected to Christ, are called gods,[fn-103-P10310_3233423:159-nf] rightly also Christ is God. And if any angel at all subjected to Christ can be called God, and this, if it be said, is also professed without blasphemy, certainly much more can this be fitting for Christ, Himself the Son of God, for Him to be pronounced God. For if an angel who is subjected to Christ is exalted as God, much more, and more consistently, shall Christ, to whom all angels are subjected, be said to be God. For it is not suitable to nature, that what is conceded to the lesser should be denied to the greater. Thus, if an angel be inferior to Christ, and yet an angel is called god, rather by consequence is Christ said to be God, who is discovered to be both greater and better, not than one, but than all angels. And if \"God standeth in the assembly of the gods, and in the midst God distinguisheth between the gods,\"[fn-103-P10311_3234319:160-nf] and Christ stood at various times in the synagogue, then Christ stood in the synagogue as God,-judging, to wit, between the gods, to whom He says, \"How long do ye accept the persons of men? \"That is to say, consequently, charging the men of the synagogue with not practising just judgments. Further, if they who are reproved and blamed seem even for any reason to attain this name without blasphemy, that they should be called gods, assuredly much more shall He be esteemed God, who not only is said to have stood as God in the synagogue of the gods, but moreover is revealed by the same authority 9f the reading as distinguishing and judging between gods. But even if they who \"fall like one of the princes\" are still called gods, much rather shall He be said to be God, who not only does not fall like one of the princes, but even overcomes both the author and prince of wickedness himself.

It includes the idea of His Goodness, His Justice, His Omnipotence: that He admits of no variableness nor alteration, but is always the same; incapable of changing to worse or changing to better, because the first is not His nature, the second He does not admit of; for what can be higher than the Highest, what can be better than the Best? In fact, He is thus associated with all perfection, and, as to every form of alteration, is unalterable; He did not on occasions display this attribute, but was always so, both before the Dispensation that made Him man, and during it, and after it; and in all His activities in our behalf He never lowered any part of that changeless and unvarying character to that which was out of keeping with it. What is essentially imperishable and changeless is always such; it does not follow the variation of a lower order of things, when it comes by dispensation to be there; just as the sun, for example, when he plunges his beam into the gloom, does not dim the brightness of that beam; but instead, the dark is changed by the beam into light; thus also the True Light, shining in our gloom, was not itself overshadowed with that shade, but enlightened it by means of itself. Well, seeing that our humanity was in darkness, as it is written, 'They know not, neither will they understand, they walk on in darkness[fn-43-P4390_2869368:8-nf] ,\" the Illuminator of this darkened world darted the beam of His Divinity through the whole compound of our nature, through soul, I say, and body too, and so appropriated humanity entire by means of His own light, and took it up and made it just that thing which He is Himself. And as this Divinity was not made perishable, though it inhabited a perishable body, so neither did it alter in the direction of any change, though it healed the changeful in our soul: in medicine, too, the physician of the body, when he takes hold of his patient, so far from himself contracting the disease, thereby perfects the cure of the suffering part. Let no one, either, putting a wrong interpretation on the words of the Gospel, suppose that our human nature in Christ was transformed to something more divine by any gradations and advance: for the increasing in stature and in wisdom and in favour, is recorded in Holy Writ only to prove that Christ really was present in the human compound, and so to leave no room for their surmise, who propound that a phantom, or form in human outline, and not a real Divine Manifestation, was there. It is for this reason that Holy Writ records unabashed with regard to Him all the accidents of our nature, even eating, drinking, sleeping, weariness, nurture, increase in bodily stature, growing up-everything that marks humanity, except the tendency to sin. Sin, indeed, is a miscarriage, not a quality of human nature: just as disease and deformity are not congenital to it in the first instance, but are its unnatural accretions, so activity in the direction of sin is to be thought of as a mere mutilation of the goodness innate in us; it is not found to be itself a real thing, but we see it only in the absence of that goodness. Therefore He Who transformed the elements of our nature into His divine abilities, rendered it secure from mutilation and disease, because He admitted not in Himself the deformity which sin works in the will. \"He did no sin,\" it says, \"neither was guile found in his mouth[fn-43-P4391_2871420:9-nf] .\" And this in Him is not to be regarded in connection with any interval of time: for at once the man in Mary (where Wisdom built her house), though naturally part of our sensuous compound, along with the coming upon her of the Holy Ghost, and her overshadowing with the power of the Highest, became that which that overshadowing power in essence was: for, without controversy, it is the Less that is blest by the Greater. Seeing, then, that the power of the Godhead is an immense and immeasurable thing, while man is a weak atom, at the moment when the Holy Ghost came upon the Virgin, and the power of the Highest overshadowed her, the tabernacle formed by such an impulse was not clothed with anything of human corruption; but, just as it was first constituted, so it remained, even though it was man, Spirit nevertheless, and Grace, and Power; and the special attributes of our humanity derived lustre from this abundance of Divine Power[fn-43-P4392_2872382:10-nf] .","title":"Letter XVII.

For, behold, we take divine Scripture, and thence discourse with freedom of the religious Faith, and set it up as a light upon its candlestick, saying:-Very Son of the Father, natural and genuine, proper to His essence, Wisdom Only-begotten, and Very and Only Word of God is He; not a creature or work, but an offspring proper to the Father's essence. Wherefore He is very God, existing one[fn-53-P5326_2088819:45-nf] in essence with the very Father; while other beings, to whom He said, `I said ye are Gods[fn-53-P5327_2088993:46-nf] ,' had this grace from the Father, only by participation[fn-53-P5328_2089070:47-nf] of the Word, through the Spirit. For He is the expression of the Father's Person and Light from Light, and Power, and very Image of the Father's essence.

Or, first of all, let them read it themselves, and copy the tone of the writer; at least the mockery which they will encounter from others may instruct them how low they have fallen; and then let them proceed to explain themselves. For what can they say from it, but that `God was not always a Father, but became so afterwards; the Son was not always, for He was not before His generation; He is not from the Father, but He, as others, has come into subsistence out of nothing; He is not proper to the Father's essence, for He is a creature and work?' And `Christ is not very God, but He, as others, was made God by participation; the Son has not exact knowledge of the Father, nor does the Word see the Father perfectly; and neither exactly understands nor knows the Father. He is not the very and only Word of the Father, but is in name only called Word and Wisdom, and is called by grace Son and Power. He is not unalterable, as the Father is, but alterable in nature, as the creatures, and He comes short of apprehending the perfect knowledge of the Father.'

For as that people was held in by the five books of Moses in the Law, so that water too was enclosed by five porches. When was the water troubled? When the people of the Jews was troubled. And when was the people of the Jews troubled, but when the Lord Jesus Christ came? The Lord's Passion was the troubling of the water. For the Jews were troubled when the Lord suffered. See, what was just now read had relation to this troubling. \"The Jews wished to kill Him, not only because He did these things on the sabbaths, but because He called Himself the Son of God, making Himself equal with God.\"[fn-59-P5955_2522601:11-nf] For Christ called Himself the Son after one manner, in another was it said to men, \"I said, Ye are Gods, and ye are all children of the Most High.\"[fn-59-P5956_2522766:12-nf] For if He had made Himself the Son of God in such sort as any man whatever may be called the son of God (for by the grace of God men are called sons of God); the Jews would not have been enraged. But because they understand Him to call Himself the Son of God in another way, according to that, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God;\"[fn-59-P5957_2523162:13-nf] and according to what the Apostle saith, \"Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God;\"[fn-59-P5958_2523296:14-nf] they saw a than, and they were enraged, because He made Himself equal with God. But He well knew that He was equal, but wherein they saw not. For that which they saw they wished to crucify; by That which they saw not, they were judged. What did the Jews see? What the Apostles also saw, when Philip said, \"Show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.\"[fn-59-P5959_2523662:15-nf] But what did the Jews not see? What not even the Apostles saw, when the Lord answered, \"Have I been so long time with you, and yet have ye not known Me? He that seeth Me, seeth the Father also.\"[fn-59-P5960_2523875:16-nf] Because then the Jews were not able to see This in Him, they held Him for a proud and ungodly man, making Himself equal with God. Here was a troubling, the water was troubled, the Angel had come. For the Lord is called also the \"Angel of the Great Counsel,\"[fn-59-P5961_2524151:17-nf] in that He is the messenger of the Father's will. For Angel in Greek is in Latin \"messenger\". So you have the Lord saying that He announces to us the kingdom of Heaven. He then bad come, the \"Angel of the Great Counsel,\" but the Lord of all the Angels. \"Angel\" on this account, because He took Flesh; the \"Lord of Angels,\" in that by \"Him all things were made, and without Him was nothing made.\"[fn-59-P5962_2524570:18-nf] For if all things, Angels too.

Let us say to God on their behalf, \"Let them know that the Lord is Thy Name; and\" not \"that\" men, but \"Thou Only art the Most High over all the earth.\"[fn-62-P6230_2639192:38-nf] Let us turn to the Lord, etc.","title":"Sermon LXXIX.

For thus it is written, that, when the first man received a commandment from God to eat of every tree that was in the garden,[fn-50-P5099_1502190:9-nf] but not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the serpent having persuaded them by means of the woman, through the promise that they would become gods, made them look up;[fn-51-P5100_1502423:10-nf] and then, when they had thus looked up, God said,[fn-51-P5101_1502681:11-nf] `Behold, Adam is become as one of us.' When, then, the serpent said,[fn-51-P5102_1502769:12-nf] `Ye shall be as gods, 'he plainly speaks in the belief that gods exist; all the more as God also added His testimony, saying, `Behold, Adam is become as one of us.' The serpent, then, who said that there are many gods, did not speak falsely. Again, the scripture,[fn-51-P5103_1503051:13-nf] `Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the rulers of thy people, 'points out many gods whom it does not wish even-to be cursed. But it is also somewhere else written,[fn-51-P5104_1503241:14-nf] ` `Did another god dare to enter and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, as did I the Lord God? 'When He says, `Did another God dare? 'He speaks on the supposition that other gods exist. And elsewhere:[fn-51-P5105_1503478:15-nf] `Let the gods that have not made the heavens and the earth perish; 'as if those who had made them were not to perish. And in another place, when it says,[fn-51-P5106_1503649:16-nf] `Take heed to thyself lest thou go and serve other gods whom thy fathers knew not, 'it speaks as if other gods existed whom they were not to follow. And again:[fn-51-P5107_1503829:17-nf] `The names of other gods shall not ascend upon thy lips.' Here it mentions many gods whose names it does not wish to be uttered. And again it is written,[fn-51-P5108_1504009:18-nf] `Thy God is the Lord, He is God of gods.' And again:[fn-51-P5109_1504080:19-nf] `Who is like unto Thee, O Lord, among the Gods? 'And again:[fn-51-P5110_1504170:20-nf] `God is Lord of gods.' And again:[fn-51-P5111_1504219:21-nf] `God stood in the assembly of gods: He judgeth among the gods.' Wherefore I wonder how, when there are so many passages in writing which testify that there are many gods, you have asserted that we ought neither to say nor to think that there are many.[fn-51-P5112_1504491:22-nf] Finally, if you have anything to say against what has been spoken so distinctly, say it in the presence of all.\"","title":"Homily XVI","author":"Pseudo-Clementine"},{"chapter":82,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_26_letter_viii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"3. We in accordance with the true doctrine speak of the Son as neither like,[fn-26-P2661_896588:9-nf] nor unlike[fn-26-P2662_896638:10-nf] the Father. Each of these terms is equally impossible, for like and unlike are predicated in relation to quality, and the divine is free from quality. We, on the contrary, confess identity of nature and accepting the consubstantiality, and rejecting the composition of the Father, God in substance, Who begat the Son, God in substance. From this the consubstantiality[fn-26-P2663_897082:11-nf] is proved. For God in essence or substance is co-essential or con-substantial with God in essence or substance. But when even man is called \"god\" as in the words, \"I have said ye are gods,\"[fn-26-P2664_897294:12-nf] and \"daemon\" as in the words, \"The gods of the nations are daemons,\"[fn-26-P2665_897383:13-nf] in the former case the name is given by favour, in the latter untruly. God alone is substantially and essentially God. When I say \"alone\" I set forth the holy and uncreated essence and substance of God. For the word \"alone\" is used in the case of any individual and generally of human nature. In the case of an individual, as for instance of Paul, that he alone was caught into the third heaven and \"heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter,\"[fn-26-P2666_897874:14-nf] and of human nature, as when David says, \"as for man his days are as grass,\"[fn-26-P2667_897971:15-nf] not meaning any particular man, but human nature generally; for every man is short-lived and mortal. So we understand these words to be said of the nature, \"who alone hath immortality\"[fn-26-P2668_898174:16-nf] and \"to God only wise,\"[fn-26-P2669_898218:17-nf] and \"none is good save one, that is God,\"[fn-26-P2670_898279:18-nf] for here \"one\" means the same as alone. So also, \"which alone spreadest out the heavens,\"[fn-26-P2671_898390:19-nf] and again \"Thou shall worship the Lord thy God and Him only shalt thou serve.\"[fn-26-P2672_898486:20-nf] \"There is no God beside me.\"[fn-26-P2673_898690:21-nf] In Scripture \"one\" and \"only\" are not predicated of God to mark distinction from the Son and the Holy Ghost, but to except the unreal gods falsely so called.As for instance, \"The Lord alone did lead them and there was no strange god with them,\"[fn-26-P2674_898962:22-nf] and \"then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and didserve the Lord only.\"[fn-26-P2675_899086:23-nf] And so St. Paul, \"For as there be gods many and lords many, but to us there is but out god, the Father, of whom are all things; and one Lord Jesus Christ by Whom are all things.\"[fn-26-P2676_899285:24-nf] Here we enquire why when he had said \"one God\" he was not content, for we have said that \"one\" and \"only\" when applied to God, indicate nature. Why did he add the word Father and make mention of Christ? Paul, a chosen vessel, did not, I imagine, think it sufficient only to preach that the Son is God and the Holy Ghost God, which he had expressed by the phrase \"one God.\" without, by the further addition of \"the Father,\" expressing Him of Whom are all things; and, by mentioning the Lord, signifyings the Word by Whom are all things; and yet further, by adding the words Jesus Christ, announcing the incarnation, setting forth the passion and publishing the resurrection. For the word Jesus Christ suggests all these ideas to us. For this reason too before His passion our Lord deprecates the designation of \"Jesus Christ,\" and charges His disciples to \"tell no man that He was Jesus, the Christ.\"[fn-26-P2677_900209:25-nf] For His purpose was, after the completion of the oeconomy,[fn-26-P2678_900288:26-nf] after His resurrection froth the dead, and His assumption into heaven, to commit to them the preaching of Him as Jesus, the Christ. Such is the force of the words \"That they may know Thee the only true God and JesUs Christ whom thou hast sent,\"[fn-26-P2679_900611:27-nf] and again \"Ye believe in God, believe also in me.\"[fn-26-P2680_900681:28-nf] Everywhere the Holy Ghost secures our conception of Him to save us from falling in else direction while we advance in the other, heeding the theology but neglecting the oeconomy,[fn-26-P2681_900878:29-nf] and so by omission falling into impiety.","title":"Letter VIII","author":"St. Basil"}]
