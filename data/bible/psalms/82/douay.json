{"verses":["A canticle of a psalm for Asaph.","O God, who shall be like to thee?  hold not thy peace, neither be\nthou still, O God.","For lo, thy enemies have made a noise:  and they that hate thee\nhave lifted up the head.","They have taken a malicious counsel against thy people, and have\nconsulted against thy saints.","They have said:  Come and let us destroy them, so that they be not\na nation:  and let the name of Israel be remembered no more.","For they have contrived with one consent:  they have made a\ncovenant together against thee,","The tabernacle of the Edomites, and the Ishmahelites:  Moab, and\nthe Agarens,","Gebal, and Ammon and Amalec:  the Philistines, with the\ninhabitants of Tyre.","Yea, and the Assyrian also is joined with them:  they are come to\nthe aid of the sons of Lot.","Do to them as thou didst to Madian and to Sisara:  as to Jabin at\nthe brook of Cisson.","Who perished at Endor:  and became as dung for the earth.","Make their princes like Oreb, and Zeb, and Zebee, and Salmana.\nAll their princes,","Who have said:  Let us possess the sanctuary of God for an\ninheritance.","O my God, make them like a wheel; and as stubble before the\nwind.","As fire which burneth the wood:  and as a flame burning\nmountains:","So shalt thou pursue them with thy tempest:  and shalt trouble\nthem in thy wrath.","Fill their faces with shame; and they shall seek thy name, O\nLord.","Let them be ashamed and troubled for ever and ever:  and let them\nbe confounded and perish.","And let them know that the Lord is thy name:  thou alone art the\nmost High over all the earth."]}
