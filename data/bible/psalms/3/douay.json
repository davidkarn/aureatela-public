{"verses":["The psalm of David when he fled from the face of his son Absalom.","But thou, O Lord, art my protector, my glory, and the lifter up of\nmy head.","I have cried to the Lord with my voice:  and he hath heard me from\nhis holy hill.","I have slept and have taken my rest:  and I have risen up, because\nthe Lord hath protected me.","I will not fear thousands of the people surrounding me:  arise, O\nLord; save me, O my God.","For thou hast struck all them who are my adversaries without\ncause:  thou hast broken the teeth of sinners.","Salvation is of the Lord:  and thy blessing is upon thy people."]}
