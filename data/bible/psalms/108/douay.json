{"verses":["Unto the end, a psalm for David.","O God, be not thou silent in my praise:  for the mouth of the\nwicked and the mouth of the deceitful man is opened against me.","They have spoken against me with deceitful tongues; and they\nhave compassed me about with words of hatred; and have fought against\nme without cause.","Instead of making me a return of love, they detracted me:  but I\ngave myself to prayer.","And they repaid me evil for good:  and hatred for my love.","Set thou the sinner over him:  and may the devil stand at his\nright hand.","When he is judged, may he go out condemned; and may his prayer\nbe turned to sin.","May his days be few:  and his bishopric let another take.","May his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.","Let his children be carried about vagabonds, and beg; and let\nthem be cast out of their dwellings.","May the usurer search all his substance:  and let strangers\nplunder his labours.","May there be none to help him:  nor none to pity his fatherless\noffspring.","May his posterity be cut off; in one generation may his name be\nblotted out.","May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered in the sight of\nthe Lord:  and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.","May they be before the Lord continually, and let the memory of\nthem perish from the earth:","because he remembered not to shew mercy,","But persecuted the poor man and the beggar; and the broken in\nheart, to put him to death.","And he loved cursing, and it shall come unto him:  and he would\nnot have blessing, and it shall be far from him.  And he put on cursing,\nlike a garment:  and it went in like water into his entrails, and like\noil in his bones.","May it be unto him like a garment which covereth him; and like\na girdle with which he is girded continually.","This is the work of them who detract me before the Lord; and\nwho speak evils against my soul.","But thou, O Lord, do with me for thy name's sake:  because thy\nmercy is sweet.  Do thou deliver me,","For I am poor and needy, and my heart is troubled within me.","I am taken away like the shadow when it declineth:  and I am\nshaken off as locusts.","My knees are weakened through fasting:  and my flesh is changed\nfor oil.","And I am become a reproach to them:  they saw me and they shaked\ntheir heads.","Help me, O Lord my God; save me; according to thy mercy.","And let them know that this is thy hand:  and that thou, O Lord,\nhast done it.","They will curse and thou wilt bless:  let them that rise up\nagainst me be confounded:  but thy servant shall rejoice.","Let them that detract me be clothed with shame:  and let them be\ncovered with their confusion as with a double cloak.","I will give great thanks to the Lord with my mouth:  and in the\nmidst of many I will praise him.","Because he hath stood at the right hand of the poor, to save my\nsoul from persecutors."]}
