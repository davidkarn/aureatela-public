Yet the partisans of Eusebius have received them; endeavoring to blend falsehood with truth, and that which is impious with what is sacred. But they shall not prevail, for the truth must triumph; and `light has no fellowship with darkness, nor has Christ any concord with Belial.'[fn-2-P217_57819:16-nf] Who ever heard such blasphemies? or what man of any piety is there now hearing them that is not horror-struck, and stops his ears, lest the filth of these expressions should pollute his sense of hearing? Who that hears John saying, `In the beginning was the Word,'[fn-2-P218_58104:17-nf] does not condemn those that say, `There was a period when the Word was not'? or who, hearing in the Gospel of `the only-begotten Son,' and that `all things were made by him,' will not abhor those that pronounce the Son to be one of the things made? How can he be one of the things which were made by himself? Or how can he be the only-begotten, if he is reckoned among created things? And how could he have had his existence from nonentities, since the Father has said, `My heart has indited a good matter';[fn-2-P219_58643:18-nf] and `I begat thee out of my bosom before the dawn'?[fn-2-P220_58735:19-nf] Or how is he unlike the Father's essence, who is `his perfect image,'[fn-2-P221_58901:20-nf] and `the brightness of his glory'[fn-2-P222_58952:21-nf] and says: `He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father'? Again how if the Son is the Word and Wisdom of God, was there a period when he did not exist? for that is equivalent to their saying that God was once destitute both of Word and Wisdom. How can he be mutable and susceptible of change, who says of himself, `I am in the Father, and the Father in me';[fn-2-P223_59324:22-nf] and `I and the Father are one';[fn-2-P224_59375:23-nf] and again by the Prophet,[fn-2-P225_59418:24-nf] `Behold me because I am, and have not changed'? But if any one may also apply the expression to the Father himself, yet would it now be even more fifty said of the Word; because he was not changed by having become man, but as the Apostle says,[fn-2-P226_59680:25-nf] `Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, to-day, and forever' But what could persuade them to say that he was made on our account, when Paul has expressly declared[fn-2-P227_59857:26-nf] that `all things are for him, and by him'? One need not wonder indeed at their blasphemous assertion that the Son does not perfectly know the Father; for having once determined to fight against Christ, they reject even the words of the Lord himself, when he says,[fn-2-P228_60139:27-nf] `As the Father knows me, even so know I the Father' If therefore the Father but partially knows the Son, it is manifest that the Son also knows the Father but in part. But if it would be improper to affirm this, and it be admitted that the Father perfectly knows the Son, it is evident that as the Father knows his own Word, so also does the Word know his own Father, whose Word he is. And we, by stating these things, and unfolding the divine Scriptures, have often confuted them: but again as chameleons they were changed, striving to apply to themselves that which is written, `When the ungodly has reached the depths of iniquity, he becomes contemptuous.'[fn-2-P229_60817:28-nf] Many heresies have arisen before these, which exceeding all bounds in daring, have lapsed into complete infatuation: but these persons, by attempting in all their discourses to subvert the Divinity of The Word, as hating made a nearer approach to Antichrist, have comparatively lessened the odium of former ones. Wherefore they have been publicly repudiated by the Church, and anathematized. We are indeed grieved on account of the perdition of these persons, and especially so because, after having been previously instructed in the doctrines of the Church, they have now apostatized from them. Nevertheless we are not greatly surprised at this, for Hymenaeus and Philetus[fn-2-P230_61534:29-nf] fell in like manner; and before them Judas, who had been a follower of the Saviour, but afterwards deserted him became his betrayer. Nor were we without forewarning respecting these very persons: for the Lord himself said: `Take heed that no man deceive you: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ: and shall many deceive many';[fn-2-P231_61911:30-nf] and `the time is at hand; Go ye not therefore after them.'[fn-2-P232_61990:31-nf] And Paul, having learned these things from the Saviour, wrote, `That in the latter times some should apostatize from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits, and doctrines of devils,'[fn-2-P233_62196:32-nf] who pervert the truth. Seeing then that our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ has himself enjoined this, and has also by the apostle given us intimation respecting such men, we having ourselves heard their impiety have in consequence anathematized them, as we before said, and declared them to be alienated from the Catholic Church and faith. Moreover we have intimated this to your piety, beloved and most honored fellow-ministers, in order the ye might neither receive any of them, if they should presume to come to you, nor be induced to put confidence in Eusebius, or any other who may write to you about them. For it is incumbent on us who are Christians, to turn away from all those who speak or entertain a thought against Christ, as from those who are resisting God, and are destroyers of the souls of men: neither does it become us even `to saute such men,'[fn-2-P234_63088:33-nf] as the blessed John has prohibited, `lest we should at any time be made partakers of their sins.'

As we find both expressions in use among the faithful, we use both; in the belief that full glory is equally given to the Spirit by both. The mouths, how, ever, of revilers of the truth may best be stopped by the preposition which, while it has the same meaning as that of the Scriptures, is not so wieldy a weapon for our opponents,(indeed it is now an object of their attack) and is used instead of the conjunction and. For to say \"Paul and Silvanus and Timothy\"[fn-17-P1794_461640:512-nf] is precisely the same thing as to say Paul with Timothy and Silvanus; for the connexion of the names is, preserved by either mode of expression. The Lord says \"The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-17-P1795_461861:513-nf] If I say the Father and the Son with the Holy Ghost shall I make, any difference in the sense? Of the connexion of names by means of the conjunction and the instances are many. We read \"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost,\"[fn-17-P1796_462149:514-nf] and again \"I beseech you for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit.\"[fn-17-P1797_462333:515-nf] Now if we wish to use with instead of and, what difference shall we have made? I do not see; unless any one according to hard and fast grammatical rules might prefer the conjunction as copulative and making the union stronger, and reject the preposition as of inferior force. But if we had to defend ourselves on these points I do not suppose we should require a defence of many words. As it is, their argument is not about syllables nor yet about this or that sound of a word, but about things differing. most widely in power and in truth. It is for this reason that, while the use of the syllables is really a matter of no importance whatever, our opponents are making the endeavour to authorise some syllables, and bunt out others from the Church. For my own part, although the usefulness of the word is obvious as soon as it is heard, I will nevertheless set forth the arguments which led our fathers to adopt the reasonable coarse of employing the preposition \"with.\"[fn-17-P1798_463328:516-nf] It does indeed equally well with the preposition \"and,\" confute the mischief of Sabellius;[fn-17-P1799_463444:517-nf] and it sets forth quite as well as \"and\" the distinction of the hypostases, as in the words \"I and my Father will come,\"[fn-18-P1800_463589:518-nf] and \"I and my Father are one.\"[fn-18-P1801_463640:519-nf] In addition to this the proof it contains of the eternal fellowship and uninterrupted conjunction is excellent. For to say that the Son is with the Father is to exhibit at once the distinction of the hypostases, and the inseparability of the fellowship. The same thing is observable even in mere human matters, for the conjunction \"and\" intimates that there is a common element in an action, while the preposition \"with\" declares in some sense as well the communion in action. As, for instance;-Paul and Timothy sailed to MaCedonia, but both Tychicus and Onesimus were sent to the Colossians. Hence we learn that they did the same thing. But suppose we are told that they sailed with, and were sent with? Then we are informed in addition that they carried out the action in company with one another. Thus while the word \"with\" upsets the error of Sabellius as no other word can, it routs also sinners who err in the very opposite direction; those, I mean, who separate the Son from the Father and the Spirit from the Son, by intervals of time.[fn-18-P1802_464907:520-nf] ","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":44,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_19_an_answer_to_the_jews_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"104","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Moreover, this our interpretation will be supported while (we find that) elsewhere as well the Scriptures designate Christ a warrior, as we gather from the names of certain weapons, and words of that kind.

Accept correction, lest at any time the Lord be angry, and ye perish from the righteous way, when His wrath shall be suddenly kindled upon you.\"[fn-20-P2099_879791:101-nf] He does not say, \"Lest at any time the Lord be angry and refuse to show you the righteous way,\" or, \"refuse to lead you into the way of righteousness;\" but even after you are walking therein, he was able so to terrify as to say, \"Lest ye perish from the righteous way.\" Now, whence could this arise if not from pride, which (as I have so often said, and must repeat again and again) has to be guarded against even in things which are rightly done, that is, in the very way of righteousness, lest a man, by regarding as his own that which is really God's, lose what is God's and be reduced merely to what is his own? Let us then carry out the concluding injunction of this same psalm, \"Blessed are all they that trust in Him,\"[fn-21-P2100_880541:102-nf] so that He may Himself indeed effect and Himself show His own way in us, to whom it is said, \"Show us Thy mercy, O Lord;\"[fn-21-P2101_880682:103-nf] and Himself bestow on us the pathway of safety that we may walk therein, to whom the prayer is offered, \"And grant us Thy salvation;\"[fn-21-P2102_880837:104-nf] and Himself lead us in the self-same way, to whom again it is said, \"Guide me, O Lord, in Thy way, and in Thy truth will I walk;\"[fn-21-P2103_880988:105-nf] Himself, too, conduct us to those promises whither His way leads, to whom it is said, \"Even there shall Thy hand lead me and Thy right hand shall hold me;\"[fn-21-P2104_881167:106-nf] Himself pasture therein those who sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, of whom it is said, \"He shall make them sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.\"[fn-21-P2105_881360:107-nf] Now we do not, when we make mention of these things, take away freedom of will, but we preach the grace of God. For to whom are those gracious gifts of use, but to the man who uses, but humbly uses, his own will, and makes no boast of the power and energy thereof, as if it alone were sufficient for perfecting him in righteousness?","title":"On Nature and Grace, Against Pelagius","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":44,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_29_book_ii_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"39","folder":"ANF-03","text":"The goodness of God having, therefore, provided man for the pursuit of the knowledge of Himself, added this to its original notification,[fn-43-P4332_1403837:48-nf] that it first prepared a habitation for him, the vast fabric (of the world) to begin with, and then afterwards[fn-43-P4333_1403968:49-nf] the vaster one (of a higher world,[fn-43-P4334_1404035:50-nf] ) that he might on a great as well as on a smaller stage practise and advance in his probation, and so be promoted from the good which God had given him, that is, from his high position, to God's best; that is, to some higher abode.[fn-43-P4335_1404341:51-nf] In this good work God employs a most excellent minister, even His own Word. \"My heart\" He says, \"hath emitted my most excellent Word.\"[fn-43-P4336_1404500:52-nf] Let Marcion take hence his first lesson on the noble fruit of this truly most excellent tree.

The sapling, however, of his blasphemy shall be never strong: it shall wither with its planter, and thus shall be manifested the nature of the good tree. Look at the total result: how fruitful was the Word! God issued His fiat, and it was done: God also saw that it was good;[fn-43-P4337_1406198:53-nf] not as if He were ignorant of the good until He saw it; but because it was good, He therefore saw it, and honoured it, and set His seal upon it; and consummated[fn-43-P4338_1406372:54-nf] the goodness of His works by His vouchsafing to them that contemplation. Thus God blessed what He made good, in order that He might commend Himself to you as whole and perfect, good both in word and act.[fn-43-P4339_1406654:55-nf] As yet the Word knew no malediction, because He was a stranger to malefaction.[fn-43-P4340_1406825:56-nf] We shall see what reasons required this also of God. Meanwhile the world consisted of all things good, plainly foreshowing how much good was preparing for him for whom all this was provided. Who indeed was so worthy of dwelling amongst the works of God, as he who was His own image and likeness? That image was wrought out by a goodness even more operative than its wont,[fn-43-P4341_1407328:57-nf] with no imperious word, but with friendly hand preceded by an almost affable[fn-43-P4342_1407440:58-nf] utterance: \"Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.\"[fn-43-P4343_1407520:59-nf] Goodness spake the word; Goodness formed man of the dust of the ground into so great a substance of the flesh, built up out of one material with so many qualities; Goodness breathed into him a soul, not dead but living. Goodness gave him dominion[fn-43-P4344_1407784:60-nf] over all things, which he was to enjoy and rule over, and even give names to. In addition to this, Goodness annexed pleasures[fn-43-P4345_1407926:61-nf] to man so that, while master of the whole world,[fn-43-P4346_1407990:62-nf] he might tarry among higher delights, being translated into paradise, out of the world into the Church.[fn-43-P4347_1408123:63-nf] The self-same Goodness provided also a help meet for him, that there might be nothing in his lot that was not good. For, said He, that the man be alone is not good.[fn-43-P4348_1408560:64-nf] He knew full well what a blessing to him would be the sex of Mary,[fn-43-P4349_1408649:65-nf] and also of the Church. The law, however, which you find fault with,[fn-43-P4350_1408892:66-nf] and wrest into a subject of contention, was imposed on man by Goodness, aiming at his happiness, that he might cleave to God, and so not show himself an abject creature rather than a free one, nor reduce himself to the level of the other animals, his subjects, which were free from God, and exempt from all tedious subjection;[fn-43-P4351_1409232:67-nf] but might, as the sole human being, boast that he alone was worthy of receiving laws from God; and as a rational being, capable of intelligence and knowledge, be restrained within the bounds of rational liberty, subject to Him who had subjected all things unto him. To secure the observance of this law, Goodness likewise took counsel by help of this sanction: \"In the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shall surely die.\"[fn-43-P4352_1409681:68-nf] For it was a most benignant act of His thus to point out the issues of transgression, lest ignorance of the danger should encourage a neglect of obedience. Now, since[fn-43-P4353_1409866:69-nf] it was given as a reason previous to the imposition of the law, it also amounted to a motive for subsequently observing it, that a penalty was annexed to its transgression; a penalty, indeed, which He who proposed it was still unwilling that it should be incurred. Learn then the goodness of our God amidst these things and up to this point; learn it from His excellent works, from His kindly blessings, from His indulgent bounties, from His gracious providences, from His laws and warnings, so good and merciful.","title":"Book II.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":44,"verse":21,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_116_the_first_epistle","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"ANF-08","text":"Now patriarchs and primates, in investigating the case of an accused bishop, should not pronounce a final decision until, supported by the authority of the apostles, they find that the person either confesses himself guilty, or is proved so by witnesses trustworthy and regularly examined, who should not be fewer in number than were those disciples whom the Lord directed to be chosen for the help of the apostles-that is, seventy-two. Detractors also, who are to be rooted out by divine authority, and the advisers of enemies (auctores inimicorum), we do not admit in the indictment of bishops or in evidence against them; nor should any one of superior rank be indicted or condemned on the accusations of inferiors. Nor in a doubtful case should a decisive judgment be pronounced; nor should any trial be held valid unless it has been conducted according to order. No one, moreover, should be judged in his absence, because both divine and human laws forbid that. The accusers of those persons should also be free of all suspicion, because the Lord has chosen that His pillars should stand firm, and not be shaken by any one who will. For a sentence should not bind any of them if it is not given by their proper judge, because even the laws of the world ordain that that be done. For any accused bishop may, if it be necessary, choose twelve judges by whom his case may be justly judged. Nor should he be heard or excommunicated or judged until these be chosen by him; and on his being regularly summoned at first to a council of his own bishops, his case should be justly heard by them, and investigated on sound principles. The end of his case, however, should be remitted to the seat of the apostles, that it may be finally decided there. Nor should it be finished, as has been decreed of old by the apostles or their successors, until it is sustained by its authority. To it also all, and especially the oppressed, should appeal and have recourse as to a mother, that they may be nourished by her breasts, defended by her authority, and relieved of their oppressions, because \"a mother cannot,\" and should not, \"forget her son.\"[fn-88-P8888_2893294:1-nf] For the trials of bishops and graver ecclesiastical cases, as the apostles and their holy successors have decreed, are to be finally decided along with other bishops[fn-88-P8889_2893478:2-nf] by the seat of the apostles, and by no other; because, although they may be transferred to other bishops, it was yet to the blessed Apostle Peter these terms were addressed: \"Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\"[fn-88-P8890_2893824:3-nf] And the other privileges which have been granted to this holy seat alone are found embodied both in the constitutions of the apostles[fn-88-P8891_2893977:4-nf] and their successors, and in very many others in harmony with these. For the apostles have prefixed seventy[fn-88-P8892_2894273:5-nf] decrees, together with very many other bishops, and have appointed them to be kept. For to judge rashly of the secrets of another's heart is sin; and it is unjust to reprove him on suspicion whose works seem not other than good, since God alone is Judge of those things which are unknown to men. He, however, \"knoweth the secrets of the heart,\"[fn-88-P8893_2895012:6-nf] and not another. For unjust judgments are to be guarded against by all, especially however by the servants of God. \"And the servant of the Lord must not strive,\"[fn-88-P8894_2895191:7-nf] nor harm any one. For bishops are to he borne by laity and clergy, and masters by servants, in order that, under the exercise of endurance, things temporal may be maintained, and things eternal hoped for. For that increases the worth of virtue, which does not violate the purpose of religion. You should be earnestly intent that none of your brothers be grievously injured or undone.

I put on righteousness, and clothed myself with a robe and a diadem, my judgment. I was eye to the blind, and foot to the lame.

It has been ordained, indeed, in the ancient statutes, that bishops who have been ejected and spoiled of their property should recover their churches, and, in the first place, have all their property restored to them; and then, in the second place, that if any one may desire to accuse them justly, he should do so at the like risk; that the judges should be discreet, the bishops right-minded and harmonious in the Church, where they should be witnesses for ever one who seemed to be oppressed; and that they should not answer till all that belonged to them was restored to them, and to their churches by law without detriment. Nor is it strange, brethren, if they persecute you, when they persecuted even to death your Head, Christ our Lord.

Whence, too, he says Himself, \"Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake.\"[fn-89-P8912_2899720:4-nf] Sustained by these testimonies, we ought not greatly to fear the reproach of men, nor be overcome by their up-braidings, since the Lord gives us this command by Isaiah the prophet, saying, \"Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, my people, in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings; \"[fn-89-P8913_2900084:5-nf] considering what is written in the Psalm, \"Shall not God search this out? for He knoweth the secrets of the heart,[fn-89-P8914_2900214:6-nf] and the thoughts of such men, that they are vanity,\"[fn-89-P8915_2900284:7-nf] \"They spoke vanity every one with his neighbour: with deceitful lips in their heart, and with an evil heart they spoke.

For it is written, \"The way of a fool is right in his eyes; \"[fn-89-P8917_2900919:9-nf] and, \"There are ways which seem right unto a man, but the end thereof leads to death.\"[fn-89-P8918_2901025:10-nf] Now we who suffer these things ought to leave them to the judgment of God, who will render to every man according to his works;[fn-89-P8919_2901173:11-nf] who also has thundered through His servants, saying, \"Vengeance is mine, I will repay.\"[fn-89-P8920_2901281:12-nf] Assist ye, therefore, one another in good faith, and by deed and with a hearty will; nor let any one remove his hand from the help of a brother, since \"by this,\" saith the Lord, \"shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.\"[fn-89-P8921_2901557:13-nf] Whence, too, He speaks by the prophet, saying, \"Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!\"[fn-89-P8922_2901706:14-nf] In a spiritual dwelling, I interpret it, and in a concord which is in God, and in the unity of the faith which distinguishes this pleasant dwelling according to truth, which indeed was more beauteously illustrated in Aaron and the priests[fn-89-P8923_2901966:15-nf] clothed with honour, as ointment upon the head, nurturing the highest understanding and leading even to the end of wisdom. For in this dwelling the Lord has promised blessing and eternal life. Apprehending, therefore, the importance of this utterance of the prophet, we have spoken this present brotherly word for love's sake, and by no means seeking, or meaning to seek, our own things. For it is not good to repay detraction with detraction, or according to the common proverb to cast out a beam with a beam (excutere palum palo). Be it far from us. Such manners are not ours. May the Godhead indeed forbid it. By the just judgment of God, power is given sometimes to sinners to persecute His saints, in order that they who are aided and borne on by the Spirit of God may become more glorious through the discipline of sufferings. But to those very persons who persecute, and reproach, and injure them, there will doubtless be woe. Woe, woe to those who injure the servants of God; for injury done to them concerns Him whose service they discharge, and whose function they execute. But we pray that a door of enclosure be placed upon their mouths, as we desire that no one perish or be defiled by their lips, and that they think or publish with their mouth no hurtful word. Whence also the Lord speaks by the prophet, \"I said I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue.\"[fn-89-P8924_2903416:16-nf] May the Lord Almighty, and His only-begotten Son and our Saviour Jesus Christ, give you this incitement, that with all means in your power you aid all the brethren under whatsoever tribulations they labour, and esteem, as is meet, their sufferings your own.

Still, for the sake of my more intelligent hearers, I will here give an instance of his insensate malice. Basil, he says, lends God the primacy over all things by reference to the ages. What unintelligible nonsense is this! Man is made God's patron, and gives to God a primacy owing to the ages! What is this vain flourish of baseless expressions, seeing that our Master simply says that whatever in the Divine essence transcends the measurable distances of the ages in either direction is called by certain distinctive names, in the case of Him Who, as saith the Apostle, hath neither beginning of days nor end of life[fn-23-P2367_1574774:121-nf] , in order that the distinction of the conception might be marked by distinction in the names. And yet on this account Eunomius has the effrontery to write, that to call that which is anterior to all beginning ungenerate, and again that which is circumscribed by no limit, immortal and indestructible, is a bestowing or lending on our part, and other nonsense of the kind. Moreover, he says that we divide the ages into two parts, as if he had not read the words he quoted, or as if he were addressing those who had forgotten his own previous statements. For what says our Master? \"If we look at the time before the Creation, and if passing in thought through the ages we reflect on the infinitude of the Eternal Life, we signify the thought by the term ungenerate. And if we turn our thoughts to what follows, and consider the being of God as extending beyond all ages, we interpret the thought by the word endless or indestructible.\" Well, how does such an account sever the ages in twain, if by such possible words and names we signify that eternity of God which is equally observable from every point of view, in all things the same, unbroken in continuity? For seeing that human life, moving from stage to stage, advances in its progress from a beginning to an end, and our life here is divided between that which is past and that which is expected, so that the one is the subject of hope, the other of memory; on this account, as, in relation to ourselves, we apprehend a past and a future in this measurable extent, so also we apply the thought, though incorrectly, to the transcendent nature of God; not of course that God in His own existence leaves any interval behind, or passes on afresh to something that lies before, but because our intellect can only conceive things according to our nature, and measures the eternal by a past and a future, where neither the past precludes the march of thought to the illimitable and infinite, nor the future tells us of any pause or limit of His endless life. If, then, it is thus that we think and speak, why does he keep taunting us with dividing the ages? Unless, indeed, Eunomius would maintain that Holy Scripture does so too, signifying as it does by the same idea the infinity of the Divine existence; David, for example, making mention of the \"kingdom from everlasting,\" and Moses, speaking of the kingdom of God as \"extending beyond all ages,\" so that we are taught by both that every duration conceivable is environed by the Divine nature, bounded on all sides by the infinity of Him Who holds the universe in His embrace. For Moses, looking to the future, says that \"He reigneth from generation to generation for evermore.\" And great David, turning his thought backward to the past, says, \"God is our King before the ages[fn-23-P2368_1577577:122-nf] ,\" and again, \"God, Who was before the ages, shall hear us.\" But Eunomius, in his cleverness taking leave of such guides as these, says that we talk of the life that is without beginning as one, and of that which is without end as quite another, and again, of diversities of sundry ages, effecting by their own diversity a separation in our idea of God. But that our controversy may not grow to a tedious length, we will add, without criticism or comment, the outcome of Eunomius' labours on the subject, well fitted as they are by his industry displayed in the cause of error to render the truth yet more evident to the eyes of the discerning.","title":"Answer to Eunomius' Second Book","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":44,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_25_answer_to_eunomius_second_book","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"109","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Well, then, if God did not exist formerly, or if there be a time when He will not exist, He cannot be called either unending or without beginning; and so also neither inalterable, nor incorporeal, nor imperishable, if there is any suspicion of body, or destruction, or alteration with regard to Him. But if it be part of our religion to attribute to Him none of these things, then it is a sacred duty to use of Him names privative of the things abhorrent to His Nature, and to say all that we have so often enumerated already, viz. that He is imperishable, and unending, and ungenerate, and the other terms of that class, where the sense inherent in each only informs us of the privation of that which is obvious to our perception, but does not interpret the actual nature of that which is thus removed from those abhorrent conditions. What the Deity is not, the signification of these names does point out; but what that further thing, which is not these things, is essentially, remains undivulged. Moreover, even the rest of these names, the sense of which does indicate some position or some state, do not afford that indication of the Divine nature itself, but only of the results of our reverent speculations about it. For when we have concluded generally that no single thing existing, whether an object of sense or of thought, is formed spontaneously or fortuitously, but that everything discoverable in the world is linked to the Being Who transcends all existences, and possesses there the source of its continuance, and we then perceive the beauty and the majesty of the wonderful sights in creation, we thus get from these and such-like marks a new range of thoughts about the Deity, and interpret each one of the thoughts thus arising within us by a special name, following the advice of Wisdom, who says that \"by the greatness and beauty of the creatures proportionately the Maker of them is seen[fn-24-P2403_1645199:137-nf] .\" We address therefore as Creator Him Who has made all mortal things, and as Almighty Him Who has compassed so vast a creation, Whose might has been able to realize His wish. When too we perceive the good that is in our own life, we give in accordance with this the name of Good to Him Who is our life's first cause. Then also having learnt from the Divine writings the incorruptibility of the judgment to come, we therefore call Him Judge and Just, and to sum up in one word, we transfer the thoughts that arise within us about the Divine Being into the mould of a corresponding name; so that there is no appellation given to the Divine Being apart from some distinct intuition about Him. Even the word God (Qeoj) we understand to have come into usage from the activity of His seeing; for our faith tells us that the Deity is everywhere, and sees (qeasqai) all things, and penetrates all things, and then we stamp this thought with this name (Qeoj), guided to it by the Holy Voice. For he who says, \"O God, attend unto me[fn-24-P2404_1646246:138-nf] ,\" and, \"Look, O God[fn-24-P2405_1646285:139-nf] ,\" and, \"God knoweth the secrets of the heart plainly[fn-24-P2406_1646361:140-nf] ,\" reveals the latent meaning of this word, viz. that Qeoj is so called from qeasqai.

Was it by a power which he possessed of himself, or by strength given to him from above? It is impossible to suppose that so great a teacher as the apostle was ignorant of the law of God, which proclaims the following in Deuteronomy: \"Say not in thine heart, My own strength and energy of hand hath wrought for me this great power; but thou shall remember the Lord thy God, how it is He that giveth thee strength to acquire such power.\"[fn-60-P6022_2344937:92-nf] And what avails \"the good fight,\" unless followed by victory?

And if it is allowable for us to venture to say anything more on such a subject, the soul of God may perhaps be understood to mean the only-begotten Son of God. For as the soul, when implanted in the body, moves all things in it, and exerts its force over everything on which it operates; so also the only-begotten Son of God, who is His Word and Wisdom, stretches and extends to every power of God, being implanted in it; and perhaps to indicate this mystery is God either called Or described in Scripture as a body. We must, indeed, take into consideration whether it is not perhaps on this account that the soul of God may be understood to mean His only-begotten Son, because He Himself came into this world of affliction, and descended into this valley of tears, and into this place of our humiliation; as He says in the Psalm, \"Because Thou hast humiliated us in the place of affliction.\"[fn-66-P6681_1358210:157-nf] Finally, I am aware that certain critics, in explaining the words used in the Gospel by the Saviour, \"My soul is sorrowful, even unto death,\" have interpreted them of the apostles, whom He termed His soul, as being better than the rest of His body.

We do not, however, assert that it indicates any \"passion\" on His part, but that it is something which is asumed in order to discipline by stern means those sinners who have committed many and grievous sins. For that which is called God's \"wrath,\" and \"anger,\" is a means of discipline; and that such a view is agreeable to Scripture, is evident from what is said in the Psalms 6, \"O Lord, rebuke me not in Thine anger, neither chasten me in Thy hot displeasure; \"[fn-95-P9552_2476540:304-nf] and also in jeremiah. \"O Lord, correct me, but with judgment: not in Thine anger, lest Thou bring me to nothing.\"[fn-95-P9553_2476676:305-nf] Any one, moreover, who reads in the second book of Kings of the \"wrath\" of God, inducing David to number the people, and finds from the first book of Chronicles that it was the devil who suggested this measure, will, on comparing together the two statements, easily see for what purpose the \"wrath\" is mentioned, of which \"wrath,\" as the Apostle Paul declares, all men are children: \"We were by nature children of wrath, even as others.\"[fn-95-P9554_2477137:306-nf] Moreover, that \"wrath\" is no passion on the part of God, but that each one bringS it upon himself by his sins, will be clear from the further statement of Paul: \"Or despisest thou the riches of His goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? But after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God.\" How, then, can any one treasure up for himself \"wrath\" against a \"day of wrath,\" if \"wrath\" be understood in the sense of \"passion? \"or how can the \"passion of wrath\" be a help to discipline? Besides, the Scripture, which tells us not to be angry at all, and which says in the Psalms 37, \"Cease from anger, and forsake wrath,\"[fn-95-P9555_2477951:307-nf] and which commands us by the mouth of Paul to \"put off all these, anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication,\"[fn-95-P9556_2478099:308-nf] would not involve God in the same passion from which it would have us to be altogether free. It is manifest, further, that the language used regarding the wrath of God is to be understood figuratively from what is related of His \"sleep,\" from which, as if awaking Him, the prophet says: \"Awake, why sleepest Thou, Lord? \"[fn-95-P9557_2478445:309-nf] and again: \"Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.\"[fn-95-P9558_2478576:310-nf] If, then, \"sleep\" must mean something else, and not what the first acceptation of the word conveys, why should not \"wrath\" also be understood in a similar way? The \"threatenings,\" again, are intimations of the (punishments) which are to befall the wicked: for it is as if one were to call the words of a physician \"threats,\" when he tells his patients, \"I will have to use the knife, and apply cauteries, if you do not obey my prescriptions, and regulate your diet and mode of life in such a way as I direct you.\" It is no human passions, then, which we ascribe to God, nor impious opinions which we entertain of Him; nor do we err when we present the various narratives concerning Him, drawn from the Scriptures themselves, after careful comparison one with another.

They then afresh, as if forgetting the proofs which have been already urged against them, `pierce themselves through[fn-60-P6077_2420250:226-nf] ' with these bonds of irreligion, and thus argue. But the word of truth[fn-60-P6078_2420349:227-nf] confutes them as follows:-if they were disputing concerning any man, then let them exercise reason in this human way, both concerning His Word and His Son; but if of God who created man, no longer let them entertain human thoughts, but others which are above human nature. For such as he that besets, such of necessity is the offspring; and such as is the Word's Father, such must be also His Word. Now man, begotten in time, in time[fn-60-P6079_2421053:228-nf] also himself besets the child; and whereas from nothing he came to be, therefore his word[fn-60-P6080_2421163:229-nf] also is over and continues not. But God is not as man, as Scripture has said; but is existing[fn-60-P6081_2421601:230-nf] and is ever; therefore also His Word is existings and is everlastingly with the Father, as radiance of light. And man's word is composed of syllables, and neither lives nor operates anything, but is only significant of the speaker's intention, and does but go forth and go by, no more to appear, since it was not at all before it was spoken; wherefore the word of man neither lives nor operates anything, nor in short is man. And this happens to it, as I said before, because man who besets it, has his nature out of nothing. But God's Word is not merely pronounced, as one may say, nor a sound of accents, nor by His Son is meant His command[fn-60-P6082_2422272:231-nf] ; but as radiance of light, so is He perfect offspring from perfect[fn-60-P6083_2422358:232-nf] . Hence He is God also, as being God's Image; for `the Word was God[fn-60-P6084_2422466:233-nf] ' says Scripture. And man's words avail not for operation; hence man works not by means of words but of hands, for they have being, and man's word subsists not. But the `Word of God,' as the Apostle says, `is living and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in His sight; but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of Him with whom we have to do[fn-60-P6085_2423046:234-nf] ' He is then Framer of all, `and without Him was made not one thing[fn-60-P6086_2423147:235-nf] ,'nor can anything be made without Him.","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":44,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"94","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"64.

For God hath made Himself a debtor, not by owing ought, that is, not by borrowing; but by promising. We cannot therefore say to Him, \"Give back what Thou hast received.\" Since \"who hath first given to Him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?\"[fn-55-P5556_2355539:15-nf] We cannot say to Him, \"Give what Thou hast received;\" but we say without[fn-55-P5557_2355630:16-nf] scruple, \"Give what Thou hast promised.\"","title":"Sermon LX.

But the faithful and true servants of the Lord, knowing that the Lord loves the thankful, never cease to praise Him, ever giving thanks unto the Lord. And whether the time is one of ease or of affliction, they offer up praise to God with thanksgiving, not reckoning these things of time, but worshipping the Lord, the God of times[fn-89-P8954_3278251:33-nf] . Thus of old time, Job, who possessed fortitude above all men, thought of these things when in prosperity; and when in adversity, he patiently endured, and when he suffered, gave thanks. As also the humble David, in the very time of affliction sang praises and said, `I will bless the Lord at all times[fn-89-P8955_3278586:34-nf] .' And the blessed Paul, in all his Epistles, so to say, ceased not to thank God. In times of ease, he failed not, and in afflictions he gloried, knowing that `tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope, and that hope maketh not ashamed[fn-89-P8956_3278874:35-nf] .' Let us, being followers of such men, pass no season without thanksgiving, but especially now, when the time is one of tribulation, which the heretics excite against us, will we praise the Lord, uttering the words of the saints; `All these things have come upon us, yet have we not forgotten Thee[fn-89-P8957_3279190:36-nf] .' For as the Jews at that time, although suffering an assault from the tabernacles[fn-89-P8958_3279293:37-nf] of the Edomites, and oppressed by the enemies of Jerusalem, did not give themselves up, but all the more sang praises to God; so we, my beloved brethren, though hindered from speaking the word of the Lord, will the more proclaim it, and being afflicted, we will sing Psalms[fn-89-P8959_3279596:38-nf] , in that we are accounted worthy to be despised, and to labour anxiously for the truth. Yea, moreover, being grievously vexed, we will give thanks. For the blessed Apostle, who gave thanks at all times, urges us in the same manner to draw near to God saying, `Let your requests, with thanksgiving, be made known unto God[fn-89-P8960_3279940:39-nf] .' And being desirous that we should always continue in this resolution, he says, `At all times give thanks; pray without ceasing[fn-89-P8961_3280088:40-nf] .' For he knew that believers are strong while employed in thanksgiving, and that rejoicing they pass over the walls of the enemy, like those saints who said, `Through Thee will we pierce through our enemies, and by my God I will leap over a walls[fn-89-P8962_3280357:41-nf] .' At all times let us stand firm, but especially now, although many afflictions overtake us, and many heretics are furious against us. Let us then, my beloved brethren, celebrate with thanksgiving the holy feast which now draws near to us, `girding up the loins of our minds[fn-89-P8963_3280652:42-nf] ,' like our Saviour Jesus Christ, of Whom it is written, `Righteousness shall be the girdle of His loins, and faithfulness the girdle of His reins[fn-89-P8964_3280818:43-nf] .' Each one of us having in his hand the staff which came out of the root of Jesse, and our feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel[fn-89-P8965_3280971:44-nf] , let us keep the feast as Paul saith, `Not with the old leaven, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth[fn-89-P8966_3281118:45-nf] ;' reverently trusting that we are reconciled through Christ, and not departing from faith in Him, nor do we defile ourselves together with heretics, and strangers to the truth, whose conversation and whose will degrade them. But rejoicing in afflictions, we break through the furnace of iron and darkness, and pass, unharmed, over that terrible Red Sea. Thus also, when we look upon the confusion of heretics, we shall, with Moses, sing that great song of praise, and say, `We will sing unto the Lord, for He is to be gloriously praised[fn-89-P8967_3281674:46-nf] .' Thus, singing praises, and seeing that the sin which is in us has been cast into the sea, we pass over to the wilderness. And being first purified by the fast of forty days, by prayers, and fastings, and discipline, and good works, we shall be able to eat the holy Passover in Jerusalem.","title":"Letter III.

And let this be the customary boast of all of us at all times. In this David participated, saying in the Psalms, `For thy sake we die all the day; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughters[fn-91-P9132_3326585:3-nf] .' Now this is becoming in us, especially in the days of the feast, when a commemoration of the death of our Saviour is held. For he who is made like Him in His death, is also diligent in virtuous practices, having mortified his members which are upon the earth[fn-91-P9133_3326864:4-nf] , and crucifying the flesh with the affections and lusts, he lives in the Spirit, and is conformed to the Spirit[fn-91-P9134_3326993:5-nf] . He is always mindful of God, and forgets Him not, and never does the deeds of death. Now, in order that we may bear in our body the dying of Jesus, he immediately adds the way of such fellowship, saying, `we having the same spirit of faith, as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak[fn-91-P9135_3327347:6-nf] .'

Since this is so, let us make a joyful noise with the saints, and let no one of us fail of his duty in these things; counting as nothing the affliction or the trials which, especially at this time, have been enviously directed against us by the party of Eusebius. Even now they wish to injure us, and by their accusations to compass our death, because of that godliness, whose helper is the Lord.

Again, it is the Redeemer's own word, that affliction shall not befall every man in this world, but only those who have a holy fear of Him:-on this account, the more the enemies hem us in, the more let us be at liberty; although they revile us, let us come together; and the more they would turn us aside from godliness, let us the more boldly preach it saying, `All these things are come upon us, yet have we not forgotten Thee[fn-93-P9389_3401800:81-nf] ,' and we have not done evil with the Ario-maniacs, who say that Thou hast existence from those things that exist not.
