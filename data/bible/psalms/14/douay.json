{"verses":["A psalm for David.  Lord, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle?  or\nwho shall rest in thy holy hill?","He that walketh without blemish, and worketh justice:","He that speaketh truth in his heart, who hath not used deceit in\nhis tongue:  Nor hath done evil to his neighbour:  nor taken up a\nreproach against his neighbours.","In his sight the malignant is brought to nothing:  but he\nglorifieth them that fear the Lord.  He that sweareth to his neighbour,\nand deceiveth not;","He that hath not put out his money to usury, nortaken bribes\nagainst the innocent:  He that doth these things, shall not be moved for\never."]}
