{"verses":["The psalm of David before he was anointed.  The Lord is my light\nand my salvation, whom shall I fear?  The Lord is the protector of my\nlife:  of whom shall I be afraid?","Whilst the wicked draw near against me, to eat my flesh.  My\nenemies that trouble me, have themselves been weakened, and have\nfallen.","If armies in camp should stand together against me, my heart\nshall not fear.  If a battle should rise up against me, in this will I\nbe confident.","One thing I have asked of the Lord, this will I seek after; that\nI may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.  That I\nmay see the delight of the Lord, and may visit his temple.","For he hath hidden me in his tabernacle; in the day of evils, he\nhath protected me in the secret place of his tabernacle.","He hath exalted me upon a rock:  and now he hath lifted up my head\nabove my enemies.  I have gone round, and have offered up in his\ntabernacle a sacrifice of jubilation:  I will sing, and recite a psalm\nto the Lord.","Hear, O Lord, my voice, with which I have cried to thee:  have\nmercy on me and hear me.","My heart hath said to thee:  My face hath sought thee:  thy face, O\nLord, will I still seek.","Turn not away thy face from me; decline not in thy wrath from thy\nservant.  Be thou my helper, forsake me not; do not thou despise me, O\nGod my Saviour.","For my father and my mother have left me:  but the Lord hath\ntaken me up.","Set me, O Lord, a law in thy way, and guide me in the right\npath, because of my enemies.","Deliver me not over to the will of them that trouble me; for\nunjust witnesses have risen up against me; and iniquity hath lied to\nitself.","I believe to see the good things of the Lord in the land of the\nliving.","Expect the Lord, do manfully, and let thy heart take courage,\nand wait thou for the Lord."]}
