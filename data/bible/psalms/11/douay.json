{"verses":["Unto the end:  for the octave, a psalm for David.","Save me, O Lord, for there is now no saint:  truths are decayed\nfrom among the children of men.","They have spoken vain things, every one to his neighbour:  with\ndeceitful lips, and with a double heart have they spoken.","May the Lord destroy all deceitful lips, and the tongue that\nspeaketh proud things.","Who have said:  We will magnify our tongue:  our lips are our own:\nwho is Lord over us?","By reason of the misery of the needy, and the groans of the poor,\nnow will I arise, saith the Lord.  I will set him in safety:  I will deal\nconfidently in his regard.","The words of the Lord are pure words:  as silver tried by the\nfire, purged from the earth, refined seven times.","Thou, O Lord, wilt preserve us:  and keep us from this generation\nfor ever.","The wicked walk round about:  according to thy highness, thou hast\nmultiplied the children of men."]}
