Behold, he says, one like the Son of man coming with the clouds of heaven. He did not say, like the Son of God, but the Son of man, that he might show that He had[fn-12-P1291_558265:118-nf] to be clothed with flesh on the earth, that having assumed the form of a man and the condition of mortality, He might teach men righteousness; and when, having completed the commands of God, He had revealed the truth to the nations, He might also suffer death, that He might overcome and lay open[fn-12-P1292_558697:119-nf] the other world also, and thus at length rising again, He might proceed to His Father borne aloft on a cloud.[fn-12-P1293_558834:120-nf] For the prophet said in addition: And came even to the Ancient of days, and was presented to Him. He called the Most High God the Ancient of days, whose age and origin cannot be comprehended; for He alone was from generations, and He will be always to generations.[fn-12-P1294_559160:121-nf] But that Christ, after His passion and resurrection, was about to ascend to God the Father, David bore witness in these words in the cixth Psalm:[fn-12-P1295_559324:122-nf] \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\" Whom could this prophet, being himself a king, call his Lord, who sat at the right hand of God, but Christ the Son of God, who is King of kings and Lord of lords? And this is more plainly shown by Isaiah,[fn-12-P1296_559646:123-nf] when he says: \"Thus saith the Lord God to my Lord Christ, whose right hand I have holden; I will subdue nations before Him, and will break the strength of kings. I will open before Him gates, and the cities shall not be closed. I will go before Thee, and will make the mountains level; and I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and shatter the bars of iron; and I will give Thee the hidden and invisible treasures, that Thou mayest know that I am the Lord God, which call Thee by Thy name, the God of Israel.\" Lastly, on account of the goodness and faithfulness which He displayed towards God on earth, there was given to Him a kingdom, and glory, and dominion; and all people, tribes, and languages shall serve Him; and His dominion is everlasting, and that which shall never pass away, and His kingdom shall not be destroyed. And this is understood in two ways: that even now He has an everlasting dominion, when all nations and all languages adore His name, confess His majesty, follow His teaching, and imitate His goodness: He has power and glory, in that all tribes of the earth obey His precepts. And also, when He shall come again with majesty and glory to judge every soul, and to restore the righteous to life, then He shall truly have the government of the whole earth: then, every evil having been removed from the affairs of men, a golden age (as the poets call it), that is, a time of righteousness and peace, will arise. But we will speak of these things more fully in the last book, when we shall speak of His second advent; now let us treat of His first advent, as we began.","title":"Book IV.

This is the faithful house, this is the everlasting temple; and if any one hath not sacrificed in this, he will not have the reward of immortality. And since Christ was the builder of this great and eternal temple, He must also have an everlasting priesthood in it; and there can be no approach to the shrine of the temple, and to the sight of God, except through Him who built the temple. David in the cixth Psalm teaches the same, saying:[fn-13-P1329_572566:148-nf] \"Before the morning-star I begat Thee.

For as a fourth part of the separate component parts of this world, and in fact as the last, the earth is found; so that you begin with the heavens, you reckon the air the second, water the third, the earth the fourth. It may therefore seem to be suitably said, \"till thou hast paid the last fourth,\" in the sense of \"till thou hast expiated thy earthly sins:\" for this the sinner also heard, \"Earth thou art, and unto earth shall thou return.\"[fn-3-P364_93266:96-nf] Then, as to the expression \"till thou hast paid,\" I wonder if it does not mean that punishment which is called eternal.[fn-3-P365_93405:97-nf] For whence is that debt paid where there is now no opportunity given of repenting and of leading a more correct life?

Hence, as it is there understood of Him respecting whom it is said, \"He must reign, till He hath put His enemies under His feet\" that He will reign for ever, inasmuch as they will be for ever under His feet: so here it may be understood of him respecting whom itis said, \"Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing,\" that he will never come out; for he is always paying the uttermost farthing, so long as he is suffering the everlasting punishment of his earthly sins.

For he says, in the very passage that is before us for examination, exactly thus:-\"The blessed Peter speaks of Him Who was in the beginning and was God, and expounds to us that it was He Who became Lord and Christ.\" Eunomius, then, says that He Who was whatsoever He was became Lord and Christ, as the history of David tells us that he, being the son of Jesse, and a keeper of the flocks, was anointed to be king: not that the anointing then made him to be a man, but that he, being what he was by his own nature, was transformed from an ordinary man to a king. What follows? Is it thereby the more established that the essence of the Son was made, if, as Eunomius says, God made Him, when He was in the beginning and was God, both Lord and Christ? For Lordship is not a name of His being but of His being in authority, and the appellation of Christ indicates His kingdom, while the idea of His kingdom is one, and that of His Nature another. Suppose that Scripture does say that these things took place with regard to the Son of God. Let us then consider which is the more pious and the more rational view. Which can we allowably say is made partaker of superiority by way of advancement-God or man? Who has so childish a mind as to suppose that the Divinity passes on to perfection by way of addition? But as to the Human Nature, such a supposition is not unreasonable, seeing that the words of the Gospel clearly ascribe to our Lord iincrease in respect of His Humanity: for it says, \"Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and favour[fn-17-P1736_1004872:59-nf] .\" Which, then, is the more reasonable suggestion to derive from the Apostle's words?-that He Who was God in the beginning became Lord by way of advancement, or that the lowliness of the Human Nature was raised to the height of majesty as a result of its communion with the Divine? For the prophet David also, speaking in the person of the Lord, says, \"I am established as king by Him[fn-17-P1737_1005278:60-nf] ,\" with a meaning very close to \"I was made Christ:\" and again, in the person of the Father to the Lord, he says, \"Be Thou Lord in the midst of Thine enemies[fn-17-P1738_1005458:61-nf] ,\" with the same meaning as Peter, \"Be Thou made Lord of Thine enemies.\" As, then, the establishment of His kingdom does not signify the formation of His essence, but the advance to His dignity, and He Who bids Him \"be Lord\" does not command that which is non-existent to come into being at that particular time, but gives to Him Who is the rule over those who are disobedient,-so also the blessed Peter, when he says that one has been made Christ (that is, king of all) adds the word \"Him\" to distinguish the idea both from the essence and from the attributes contemplated in connection with it. For He made Him what has been declared when He already was that which He is. Now if it were allowable to assert of the transcendent Nature that it became anything by way of advancement, as a king from being an ordinary man, or lofty from being lowly, or Lord from being servant, it might be proper to apply Peter's words to the Only-begotten. But since the Divine Nature, whatever it is believed to be, always remains the same, being above all augmentation and incapable of diminution, we are absolutely compelled to refer his saying to the Humanity. For God the Word is now, and always remains, that which He was in the beginning, always King, always Lord, always God and Most High, not having become any of these things by way of advancement, but being in virtue of His Nature all that He is declared to be, while on the other hand He Who was, by being assumed, elevated from Man to the Divinity, being one thing and becoming another, is strictly and truly said to have become Christ and Lord. For He made Him to be Lord from being a servant, to be King from being a subject, to be Christ from being in subordination. He highly exalted that which was lowly, and gave to Him that had the Human Name that Name which is above every name[fn-17-P1739_1007307:62-nf] . And thus came to pass that unspeakable mixture and conjunction of human littleness commingled with Divine greatness, whereby even those names which are great and Divine are properly applied to the Humanity, while on the other hand the Godhead is spoken of by human names[fn-17-P1740_1007602:63-nf] . For it is the same Person who both has the Name which is above every name, and is worshipped by all creation in the human Name of Jesus. For he says, \"at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow, of things in heaven and things in earth, and things under the earth, and every tongue shall confess that Jesus is Lord, to the glory of God the Father[fn-17-P1741_1008250:64-nf] .\" But enough of these matters.

Now David was a man skilled in songs, who dearly loved musical harmony, not with a vulgar delight, but with a believing disposition, and by it served his God, who is the true God, by the mystical representation of a great thing. For the rational and well-ordered concord of diverse sounds in harmonious variety suggests the compact unity of the well-ordered city. Then almost all his prophecy is in psalms, of which a hundred and fifty are contained in what we call the Book of Psalms, of which some will have it those only were made by David which are inscribed with his name. But there are also some who think none of them were made by him except those which are marked \"Of David;\" but those which have in the title \"For David\" have been made by others who assumed his person. Which opinion is refuted by the voice of the Saviour Himself in the Gospel, when He says that David himself by the Spirit said Christ was his Lord; for the 110th Psalm begins thus, \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\"[fn-31-P3173_1747778:102-nf] And truly that very psalm, like many more, has in the title, not \"of David,\" but \"for David.\" But those seem to me to hold the more credible opinion, who ascribe to him the authorship of all these hundred and fifty psalms, and think that he prefixed to some of them the names even of other men, who prefigured something pertinent to the matter, but chose to have no man's name in the titles of the rest, just as God inspired him in the management of this variety, which, although dark, is not meaningless. Neither ought it to move one not to believe this that the names of some prophets who lived long after the times of king David are read in the inscriptions of certain psalms in that book, and that the things said there seem to be spoken as it were by them. Nor was the prophetic Spirit unable to reveal to king David, when he prophesied, even these names of future prophets, so that he might prophetically sing something which should suit their persons; just as it was revealed to a certain prophet that king Josiah should arise and reign after more than three hundred years, who predicted his future deeds also along with his name.[fn-31-P3174_1748960:103-nf] ","title":"Book XVII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":110,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_23_book_xvii","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"80","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Just as in that psalm also where Christ is most openly proclaimed as Priest, even as He is here as King, \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\"[fn-31-P3193_1757880:112-nf] That Christ sits on the right hand of God the Father is believed, not seen; that His enemies also are put under His feet doth not yet appear; it is being done, [therefore] it will appear at last: yea, this is now believed, afterward it shall be seen.

Therefore to these manifest things are to be referred, when rightly understood, those things in the same psalm that are set down a little more obscurely, and we have already made known in our popular sermons how these things are to be rightly understood. So also in that where Christ utters through prophecy the humiliation of His passion, saying, \"They pierced my hands and feet; they counted all my bones. Yea, they looked and stared at me.\"[fn-31-P3197_1759674:116-nf] By which words he certainly meant His body stretched out on the cross, with the hands and feet pierced and perforated by the striking through of the nails, and that He had in that way made Himself a spectacle to those who looked and stared.

For when Paul says, \"Now the Lord is the Spirit,\" he goes on to say, \"and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.\" If then \"the Lord is the Spirit,\" and \"Spirit\" means \"essence,\" what are we to understand by \"the essence of the essence\"? He speaks again of another Spirit of the Lord Who is the Spirit,-that is to say, according to your interpretation, of another essence. Therefore in your view the Apostle, when he writes expressly of \"the Lord the Spirit,\" and of \"the Spirit of the Lord,\" means nothing else than an essence of an essence. Well, let Eunomius make what he likes of that which is written; what we understand of the matter is as follows. The Scripture, \"given by inspiration of God,\" as the Apostle calls it, is the Scripture of the Holy Spirit, and its intention is the profit of men. For \"every scripture,\" he says, \"is given by inspiration of God and is profitable\"; and the profit is varied and multiform, as the Apostle says-\"for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness[fn-17-P1758_1014334:9-nf] .\" Such a boon as this, however, is not within any man's reach to lay hold of, but the Divine intention lies hid under the body of the Scripture, as it were under a veil, some legislative enactment or some historical narrative being cast over the truths that are contemplated by the mind. For this reason, then, the Apostle tells us that those who look upon the body of the Scripture have \"a veil upon their heart[fn-17-P1759_1014768:10-nf] ,\" and are not able to look upon the glory of the spiritual law, being hindered by the veil that has been cast over the face of the law-giver. Wherefore he says, \"the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life,\" showing that often the obvious interpretation, if it be not taken according to the proper sense, has an effect contrary to that life which is indicated by the Spirit, seeing that this lays down for all men the perfection of virtue in freedom from passion, while the history contained in the writings sometimes embraces the exposition even of facts incongruous, and is understood, so to say, to concur with the passions of our nature, whereto if any one applies himself according to the obvious sense, he will make the Scripture a doctrine of death. Accordingly, he says that over the perceptive powers of the souls of men who handle what is written in too corporeal a manner, the veil is cast; but for those who turn their contemplation to that which is the object of the intelligence, there is revealed, bared, as it were, of a mask, the glory that underlies the letter. And that which is discovered by this more exalted perception he says is the Lord, which is the Spirit. For he says, \"when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be takenaway: now the Lord is the Spirit[fn-17-P1760_1016077:11-nf] .\" And in so saying he makes a distinction of contrast between the lordship of the spirit and the bondage of the letter; for as that which gives life is opposed to that which kills, so he contrasts \"the Lord\" with bondage. And that we may not be under any confusion when we are instructed concerning the Holy Spirit (being led by the word \"Lord\" to the thought of the Only-begotten), for this reason he guards the word by repetition, both saying that \"the Lord is the Spirit,\" and making further mention of \"the Spirit of the Lord,\" that the supremacy of His Nature may be shown by the honour implied in lordship, while at the same time he may avoid confusing in his argument the individuality of His Person. For he who calls Him both \"Lord\" and \"Spirit of the Lord,\" teaches us to conceive of Him as a separate individual besides the Only-begotten; just as elsewhere he speaks of \"the Spirit of Christ[fn-17-P1761_1017017:12-nf] ,\" employing fairly and in its mystic sense this very term which is piously employed in the system of doctrine according to the Gospel tradition. Thus we, the \"most miserable of all men,\" being led onward by the Apostle in the mysteries, pass from the letter that killeth to the Spirit that giveth life, learning from Him Who was in Paradise initiated into the unspeakable mysteries, that all things the Divine Scripture says are utterances of the Holy Spirit. For \"well did the Holy Spirit prophesy[fn-17-P1762_1017536:13-nf] ,\"-this he says to the Jews in Rome, introducing the words of Isaiah; and to the Hebrews, alleging the authority of the Holy Spirit in the words, \"wherefore as saith the Holy Spirit[fn-17-P1763_1017744:14-nf] ,\" he adduces the words of the Psalm which are spoken at length in the person of God; and from the Lord Himself we learn the same thing,-that David declared the heavenly mysteries not \"in\" himself (that is, not speaking according to human nature). For how could any one, being but man, know the supercelestial converse of the Father with the Son? But being \"in the Spirit\" he said that the Lord spoke to the Lord those words which He has uttered. For if, He says, \"David in the Spirit calls him Lord, how is He then his son[fn-17-P1764_1018287:15-nf] ?\" Thus it is by the power of the Spirit that the holy men who are under Divine influence are inspired, and every Scripture is for this reason said to be \"given by inspiration of God,\" because it is the teaching of the Divine afflatus. If the bodily veil of the words were removed, that which remains is Lord and life and Spirit, according to the teaching of the great Paul, and according to the words of the Gospel also. For Paul declares that he who turns from the letter to the Spirit no longer apprehends the bondage that slays, but the Lord which is the life-giving Spirit; and the sublime Gospel says, \"the words that I speak are spirit and are life[fn-17-P1765_1018982:16-nf] ,\" as being divested of the bodily veil. The idea, however, that \"the Spirit\" is the essence of the Only-begotten, we shall leave to our dreamers: or rather, we shall make use, ex abundanti, of what they say, and arm the truth with the weapons of the adversary. For it is allowable that the Egyptian should be spoiled by the Israelites, and that we should make their wealth an ornament for ourselves. If the essence of the Son is called \"Spirit,\" and God also is Spirit, (for so the Gospel tells us[fn-17-P1766_1019506:17-nf] ), clearly the essence of the Father is called \"Spirit\" also. But if it is their peculiar argument that things which are introduced by different names are different also in nature, the conclusion surely is, that things which are named alike are not alien one from the other in nature either. Since then, according to their account, the essence of the Father and that of the Son are both called \"Spirit,\" hereby is clearly proved the absence of any difference in essence. For a little further on Eunomius says:-\"Of those essences which are divergent the appellations significant of essence are also surely divergent, but where there is one and the same name, that which is declared by the same appellation will surely be one also\":-so that at all points \"He that taketh the wise in their own craftiness[fn-17-P1767_1020329:18-nf] \" has turned the long labours of our author, and the infinite toil spent on what he has elaborated, to the establishment of the doctrine which we maintain. For if God is in the Gospel called \"Spirit,\" and the essence of the Only-begotten is maintained by Eunomius to be \"Spirit,\" as there is no apparent difference in the one name as compared with the other, neither, surely, will the things signified by the names be mutually different in nature.","title":"Book VII","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":110,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_18_book_vii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Then how will you make it fit with what follows?

For the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the one true King and the one true Priest, the former to rule us, and the latter to make expiation for us, has shown us how His own figure bore these two parts together, which were only separately commended [to notice] among the Fathers.[fn-10-P1051_413898:9-nf] This becomes apparent if (for example) we look to that inscription which was affixed to His cross\"King of the Jews:\" in connection also with which, and by a secret instinct, Pilate replied, \"What I have written, I have written.\"[fn-10-P1052_414212:10-nf] For it had been said aforetime in the Psalms, \"Destroy not the writing of the title.\"[fn-10-P1053_414320:11-nf] The same becomes evident, so far as the part of priest is concerned, if we have regard to what He has taught us concerning offering and receiving. For thus it is that He sent us beforehand a prophecy[fn-10-P1054_414538:12-nf] respecting Himself, which runs thus, \"Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedek.\"[fn-10-P1055_414722:13-nf] And in many other testimonies of the divine Scriptures, Christ appears both as King and as Priest. Hence, also, even David himself, whose son He is, not without good reason, more frequently declared to be than he is said to be Abraham's son, and whom Matthew and Luke have both alike held by,-the one viewing him as the person from whom, through Solomon, His lineage can be traced down, and the other taking him for the person to whom, through Nathan, His genealogy can be carried up,-did represent the part of a priest, although he was patently a king, when he ate the shew-bread. For it was not lawful for any one to eat that, save the priests only.[fn-10-P1056_415390:14-nf] To this it must be added that Luke is the only one who mentions how Mary was discovered by the angel, and how she was related to Elisabeth,[fn-10-P1057_415563:15-nf] who was the wife of Zacharias the priest. And of this Zacharias the same evangelist has recorded the fact, that the woman whom he had for wife was one of the daughters of Aaron, which is to say she belonged to the tribe of the priests.[fn-10-P1058_416044:16-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":110,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":43,"source_paragraph":"133","folder":"ANF-03","text":"\"Woe,\" says He, \"to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed!\"[fn-69-P6971_2028128:1611-nf] Now it is certain that in this woe must be understood the imprecation and threat of an angry and incensed Master, unless Judas was to escape with impunity after so vast a sin. If he were meant to escape with impunity, the \"woe\" was an idle word; if not, he was of course to be punished by Him against whom he had committed the sin of treachery. Now, if He knowingly permitted the man, whom He[fn-69-P6972_2028545:1612-nf] deliberately elected to be one of His companions, to plunge into so great a crime, you must no longer use an argument against the Creator in Adam's case, which may now recoil on your own God:[fn-69-P6973_2028752:1613-nf] either that he was ignorant, and had no foresight to hinder the future sinner;[fn-69-P6974_2028966:1614-nf] or that he was unable to hinder him, even if he was ignorant;[fn-69-P6975_2029057:1615-nf] or else that he was unwilling, even if he had the foreknowledge and the ability; and so deserved the stigma of maliciousness, in having permitted the man of his own choice to perish in his sin. I advise you therefore (willingly) to acknowledge the Creator in that god of yours, rather than against your will to be assimilating your excellent god to Him. For in the case of Peter,[fn-69-P6976_2029560:1616-nf] too, he gives you proof that he is a jealous God, when he destined the apostle, after his presumptuous protestations of zeal, to a flat denial of him, rather than prevent his fall.[fn-69-P6977_2029901:1617-nf] The Christ of the prophets was destined, moreover, to be betrayed with a kiss,[fn-69-P6978_2030014:1618-nf] for He was the Son indeed of Him who was \"honoured with the lips\" by the people.[fn-69-P6979_2030122:1619-nf] When led before the council, He is asked whether He is the Christ.[fn-69-P6980_2030213:1620-nf] Of what Christ could the Jews have inquired[fn-69-P6981_2030285:1621-nf] but their own? Why, therefore, did He not, even at that moment, declare to them the rival (Christ)? You reply, In order that He might be able to suffer. In other words, that this most excellent god might plunge men into crime, whom he was still keeping in ignorance. But even if he had told them, he would yet have to suffer. For he said, \"If I tell you, ye will not believe.\"[fn-69-P6982_2030795:1622-nf] And refusing to believe, they would have continued to insist on his death. And would he not even more probably still have had to suffer, if had announced himself as sent by the rival god, and as being, therefore, the enemy of the Creator? It was not, then, in order that He might suffer, that He at that critical moment refrained from proclaiming[fn-69-P6983_2031166:1623-nf] Himself the other Christ, but because they wanted to extort a confession from His mouth, which they did not mean to believe even if He had given it to them, whereas it was their bounden duty to have acknowledged Him in consequence of His works, which were fulfilling their Scriptures. It was thus plainly His course to keep Himself at that moment unrevealed,[fn-69-P6984_2031556:1624-nf] because a spontaneous recognition was due to Him. But yet for all this, He with a solemn gesture[fn-69-P6985_2031773:1625-nf] says, \"Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.\"[fn-69-P6986_2031927:1626-nf] For it was on the authority of the prophecy of Daniel that He intimated to them that He was \"the Son of man,\"[fn-69-P6987_2032061:1627-nf] and of David's Psalm, that He would \"sit at the right hand of God.\"[fn-69-P6988_2032152:1628-nf] Accordingly, after He had said this, and so suggested a comparison of the Scripture, a ray of light did seem to show them whom He would have them understand Him to be; for they say: \"Art thou then the Son of God? \"[fn-69-P6989_2032387:1629-nf] Of what God, but of Him whom alone they knew? Of what God but of Him whom they remembered in the Psalm as having said to His Son, \"Sit Thou on my right hand? \"Then He answered, \"Ye say that I am; \"[fn-69-P6990_2032610:1630-nf] as if He meant: It is ye who say this-not I.

The leaders of this view seem to me to have given very little heed to these things, and for that reason to have strayed absolutely, by explaining the passage otherwise than as the divine and prophetic Scripture demands. \"The Lord created me the beginning of His ways.\"[fn-48-P4821_1826930:5-nf] For, as ye know, there is more than one signification of the word \"created; \"and in this place \"created\" is the same as \"set over\" the works made by Himself-made, I say, by the Son Himself. But this \"created\" is not to be understood in the same manner as \"made.\" For to make and to create are different from one another. \"Is not He Himself thy Father, that hath possessed thee and created thee? \"[fn-48-P4822_1827346:6-nf] says Moses in the great song of Deuteronomy.

Just as my Christ is to be expected,[fn-75-P7561_2166421:390-nf] who was predicted from the beginning, so his Christ therefore has no existence, as not having been announced from the beginning. Ours is a better faith, which believes in a future Christ, than the heretic's, which has none at all to believe in. Touching the resurrection of the dead,[fn-75-P7562_2166833:391-nf] let us first inquire how some persons then denied it. No doubt in the same way in which it is even now denied, since the resurrection of the flesh has at all times men to deny it. But many wise men claim for the soul a divine nature, and are confident of its undying destiny, and even the multitude worship the dead[fn-75-P7563_2167171:392-nf] in the presumption which they boldly entertain that their souls survive. As for our bodies, however, it is manifest that they perish either at once by fire or the wild beasts,[fn-75-P7564_2167409:393-nf] or even when most carefully kept by length of time. When, therefore, the apostle refutes those who deny the resurrection of the flesh, he indeed defends, in opposition to them, the precise matter of their denial, that is, the resurrection of the body. You have the whole answer wrapped up in this.[fn-75-P7565_2167752:394-nf] All the rest is superfluous. Now in this very point, which is called the resurrection of the dead, it is requisite that the proper force of the words should be accurately maintained.[fn-75-P7566_2167953:395-nf] The word dead expresses simply what has lost the vital principle,[fn-75-P7567_2168035:396-nf] by means of which it used to live. Now the body is that which loses life, and as the result of losing it becomes dead. To the body, therefore, the term dead is only suitable. Moreover, as resurrection accrues to what is dead, and dead is a term applicable only to a body, therefore the body alone has a resurrection incidental to it. So again the word Resurrection, or (rising again), embraces only that which has fallen down. \"To rise,\" indeed, can be predicated of that which has never fallen down, but had already been always lying down. But \"to rise again\" is predicable only of that which has fallen down; because it is by rising again, in consequence of its having fallen down, that it is said to have re-risen.[fn-75-P7568_2168768:397-nf] For the syllable RE always implies iteration (or happening again). We say, therefore, that the body falls to the ground by death, as indeed facts themselves show, in accordance with the law of God. For to the body it was said, (\"Till thou return to the ground, for out of it wast thou taken; for) dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.\"[fn-75-P7569_2169270:398-nf] That, therefore, which came from the ground shall return to the ground. Now that falls down which returns to the ground; and that rises again which falls down. \"Since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection.\"[fn-75-P7570_2169592:399-nf] Here in the word man, who consists of bodily sub stance, as we have often shown already, is presented to me the body of Christ. But if we are all so made alive in Christ, as we die in Adam, it follows of necessity that we are made alive in Christ as a bodily substance, since we died in Adam as a bodily substance. The similarity, indeed, is not complete, unless our revival[fn-75-P7571_2169989:400-nf] in Christ concur in identity of substance with our mortality[fn-75-P7572_2170071:401-nf] in Adam. But at this point[fn-75-P7573_2170119:402-nf] (the apostle) has made a parenthetical statement[fn-75-P7574_2170182:403-nf] concerning Christ, which, bearing as it does on our present discussion, must not pass unnoticed. For the resurrection of the body will receive all the better proof, in proportion as I shall succeed in showing that Christ belongs to that God who is believed to have provided this resurrection of the flesh in His dispensation. When he says, \"For He must reign, till He hath put all enemies under His feet,\"[fn-75-P7575_2170616:404-nf] we can see at once[fn-75-P7576_2170661:405-nf] from this statement that he speaks of a God of vengeance, and therefore of Him who made the following promise to Christ: \"Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool. The rod of Thy strength shall the Lord send forth from Sion, and He shall rule along with Thee in the midst of Thine enemies.\"[fn-75-P7577_2170998:406-nf] It is necessary for me to lay claim to those Scriptures which the Jews endeavour to deprive us of, and to show that they sustain my view. Now they say that this Psalm[fn-75-P7578_2171199:407-nf] was a chant in honour of Hezekiah,[fn-75-P7579_2171249:408-nf] because \"he went up to the house of the Lord,\"[fn-75-P7580_2171326:409-nf] and God turned back and removed his enemies. Therefore, (as they further hold, ) those other words, \"Before the morning star did I beget thee from the womb,\"[fn-75-P7581_2171627:410-nf] are applicable to Hezekiah, and to the birth of Hezekiah. We on our side[fn-75-P7582_2173635:411-nf] have published Gospels (to the credibility of which we have to thank[fn-75-P7583_2173716:412-nf] them[fn-75-P7584_2173737:413-nf] for having given some confirmation, indeed, already in so great a subject[fn-75-P7585_2173854:414-nf] ); and these declare that the Lord was born at night, that so it might be \"before the morning star,\" as is evident both from the star especially, and from the testimony of the angel, who at night announced to the shepherds that Christ had at that moment been born,[fn-75-P7586_2174153:415-nf] and again from the place of the birth, for it is towards night that persons arrive at the (eastern)\" inn.\" Perhaps, too, there was a mystic purpose in Christ's being born at night, destined, as He was, to be the light of the truth amidst the dark shadows of ignorance. Nor, again, would God have said, \"I have begotten Thee,\" except to His true Son. For although He says of all the people (Israel), \"I have begotten[fn-75-P7587_2174600:416-nf] children,\"[fn-75-P7588_2174646:417-nf] yet He added not \"from the womb.\" Now, why should He have added so superfluously this phrase \"from the womb\" (as if there could be any doubt about any one's having been born from the womb), unless the Holy Ghost had wished the words to be with especial care[fn-75-P7589_2174922:418-nf] understood of Christ? \"I have begotten Thee from the womb,\" that is to say, from a womb only, without a man's seed, making it a condition of a fleshly body[fn-75-P7590_2175096:419-nf] that it should come out of a womb. What is here added (in the Psalm), \"Thou art a priest for ever,\"[fn-75-P7591_2175244:420-nf] relates to (Christ) Himself. Hezekiah was no priest; and even if he had been one, he would not have been a priest for ever. \"After the order,\" says He, \"of Melchizedek.\" Now what had Hezekiah to do with Melchizedek, the priest of the most high God, and him uncircumcised too, who blessed the circumcised Abraham, after receiving from him the offering of tithes? To Christ, however, \"the order of Melchizedek\" will be very suitable; for Christ is the proper and legitimate High Priest of God. He is the Pontiff of the priesthood of the uncircumcision, constituted such, even then, for the Gentiles, by whom He was to be more fully received, although at His last coming He will favour with His acceptance and blessing the circumcision also, even the race of Abraham, which by and by is to acknowledge Him. Well, then, there is also another Psalm, which begins with these words: \"Give Thy judgments, O God, to the King,\" that is, to Christ who was to come as King, \"and Thy righteousness unto the King's son,\"[fn-75-P7592_2176269:421-nf] that is, to Christ's people; for His sons are they who are born again in Him. But it will here be said that this Psalm has reference to Solomon. However, will not those portions of the Psalm which apply to Christ alone, be enough to teach us that all the rest, too, relates to Christ, and not to Solomon? \"He shall come down,\" says He, \"like rain upon a fleece,[fn-75-P7593_2176653:422-nf] and like dropping showers upon the earth,\"[fn-75-P7594_2176740:423-nf] describing His descent from heaven to the flesh as gentle and unobserved.[fn-75-P7595_2176835:424-nf] Solomon, however, if he had indeed any descent at all, came not down like a shower, because he descended not from heaven. But I will set before you more literal points.[fn-75-P7596_2177230:425-nf] \"He shall have dominion,\" says the Psalmist, \"from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.\"[fn-75-P7597_2177361:426-nf] To Christ alone was this given; whilst Solomon reigned over only the moderately-sized kingdom of Judah. \"Yea, all kings shall fall down before Him.\" Whom, indeed, shall they all thus worship, except Christ? \"All nations shall serve Him.\"[fn-75-P7598_2177618:427-nf] To whom shall all thus do homage, but Christ? \"His name shall endure for ever.\" Whose name has this eternity of fame, but Christ's? \"Longer than the sun shall His name remain,\" for longer than the sun shall be the Word of God, even Christ. \"And in Him shall all nations be blessed.\"[fn-75-P7599_2177921:428-nf] In Solomon was no nation blessed; in Christ every nation. And what if the Psalm proves Him to be even God? \"They shall call Him blessed.\"[fn-76-P7600_2178079:429-nf] (On what ground? ) Because blessed Is the Lord God of Israel, who only doeth wonderful things.\"[fn-76-P7601_2178195:430-nf] \"Blessed also is His glorious name, and with His glory shall all the earth be filled.\"[fn-76-P7602_2178302:431-nf] On the contrary, Solomon (as I make bold to affirm) lost even the glory which he had from God, seduced by his love of women even into idolatry. And thus, the statement which occurs in about the middle of this Psalm, \"His enemies shall lick the dust\"[fn-76-P7603_2178572:432-nf] (of course, as having been, (to use the apostle's phrase, ) \"put under His feet\"[fn-76-P7604_2178672:433-nf] ), will bear upon the very object which I had in view, when I both introduced the Psalm, and insisted on my opinion of its sense,-namely, that I might demonstrate both the glory of His kingdom and the subjection of His enemies in pursuance of the Creator's own plans, with the view of laying down[fn-76-P7605_2178995:434-nf] this conclusion, that none but He can be believed to be the Christ of the Creator.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":110,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Meanwhile the Marcionite will exhibit nothing of this kind; he is by this time afraid to say which side has the better right to a Christ who is not yet revealed. Just as my Christ is to be expected,[fn-75-P7561_2166421:390-nf] who was predicted from the beginning, so his Christ therefore has no existence, as not having been announced from the beginning. Ours is a better faith, which believes in a future Christ, than the heretic's, which has none at all to believe in. Touching the resurrection of the dead,[fn-75-P7562_2166833:391-nf] let us first inquire how some persons then denied it. No doubt in the same way in which it is even now denied, since the resurrection of the flesh has at all times men to deny it. But many wise men claim for the soul a divine nature, and are confident of its undying destiny, and even the multitude worship the dead[fn-75-P7563_2167171:392-nf] in the presumption which they boldly entertain that their souls survive. As for our bodies, however, it is manifest that they perish either at once by fire or the wild beasts,[fn-75-P7564_2167409:393-nf] or even when most carefully kept by length of time. When, therefore, the apostle refutes those who deny the resurrection of the flesh, he indeed defends, in opposition to them, the precise matter of their denial, that is, the resurrection of the body. You have the whole answer wrapped up in this.[fn-75-P7565_2167752:394-nf] All the rest is superfluous. Now in this very point, which is called the resurrection of the dead, it is requisite that the proper force of the words should be accurately maintained.[fn-75-P7566_2167953:395-nf] The word dead expresses simply what has lost the vital principle,[fn-75-P7567_2168035:396-nf] by means of which it used to live. Now the body is that which loses life, and as the result of losing it becomes dead. To the body, therefore, the term dead is only suitable. Moreover, as resurrection accrues to what is dead, and dead is a term applicable only to a body, therefore the body alone has a resurrection incidental to it. So again the word Resurrection, or (rising again), embraces only that which has fallen down. \"To rise,\" indeed, can be predicated of that which has never fallen down, but had already been always lying down. But \"to rise again\" is predicable only of that which has fallen down; because it is by rising again, in consequence of its having fallen down, that it is said to have re-risen.[fn-75-P7568_2168768:397-nf] For the syllable RE always implies iteration (or happening again). We say, therefore, that the body falls to the ground by death, as indeed facts themselves show, in accordance with the law of God. For to the body it was said, (\"Till thou return to the ground, for out of it wast thou taken; for) dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.\"[fn-75-P7569_2169270:398-nf] That, therefore, which came from the ground shall return to the ground. Now that falls down which returns to the ground; and that rises again which falls down. \"Since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection.\"[fn-75-P7570_2169592:399-nf] Here in the word man, who consists of bodily sub stance, as we have often shown already, is presented to me the body of Christ. But if we are all so made alive in Christ, as we die in Adam, it follows of necessity that we are made alive in Christ as a bodily substance, since we died in Adam as a bodily substance. The similarity, indeed, is not complete, unless our revival[fn-75-P7571_2169989:400-nf] in Christ concur in identity of substance with our mortality[fn-75-P7572_2170071:401-nf] in Adam. But at this point[fn-75-P7573_2170119:402-nf] (the apostle) has made a parenthetical statement[fn-75-P7574_2170182:403-nf] concerning Christ, which, bearing as it does on our present discussion, must not pass unnoticed.

For although He says of all the people (Israel), \"I have begotten[fn-75-P7587_2174600:416-nf] children,\"[fn-75-P7588_2174646:417-nf] yet He added not \"from the womb.\" Now, why should He have added so superfluously this phrase \"from the womb\" (as if there could be any doubt about any one's having been born from the womb), unless the Holy Ghost had wished the words to be with especial care[fn-75-P7589_2174922:418-nf] understood of Christ? \"I have begotten Thee from the womb,\" that is to say, from a womb only, without a man's seed, making it a condition of a fleshly body[fn-75-P7590_2175096:419-nf] that it should come out of a womb. What is here added (in the Psalm), \"Thou art a priest for ever,\"[fn-75-P7591_2175244:420-nf] relates to (Christ) Himself. Hezekiah was no priest; and even if he had been one, he would not have been a priest for ever. \"After the order,\" says He, \"of Melchizedek.\" Now what had Hezekiah to do with Melchizedek, the priest of the most high God, and him uncircumcised too, who blessed the circumcised Abraham, after receiving from him the offering of tithes? To Christ, however, \"the order of Melchizedek\" will be very suitable; for Christ is the proper and legitimate High Priest of God. He is the Pontiff of the priesthood of the uncircumcision, constituted such, even then, for the Gentiles, by whom He was to be more fully received, although at His last coming He will favour with His acceptance and blessing the circumcision also, even the race of Abraham, which by and by is to acknowledge Him. Well, then, there is also another Psalm, which begins with these words: \"Give Thy judgments, O God, to the King,\" that is, to Christ who was to come as King, \"and Thy righteousness unto the King's son,\"[fn-75-P7592_2176269:421-nf] that is, to Christ's people; for His sons are they who are born again in Him. But it will here be said that this Psalm has reference to Solomon. However, will not those portions of the Psalm which apply to Christ alone, be enough to teach us that all the rest, too, relates to Christ, and not to Solomon? \"He shall come down,\" says He, \"like rain upon a fleece,[fn-75-P7593_2176653:422-nf] and like dropping showers upon the earth,\"[fn-75-P7594_2176740:423-nf] describing His descent from heaven to the flesh as gentle and unobserved.[fn-75-P7595_2176835:424-nf] Solomon, however, if he had indeed any descent at all, came not down like a shower, because he descended not from heaven. But I will set before you more literal points.[fn-75-P7596_2177230:425-nf] \"He shall have dominion,\" says the Psalmist, \"from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.\"[fn-75-P7597_2177361:426-nf] To Christ alone was this given; whilst Solomon reigned over only the moderately-sized kingdom of Judah. \"Yea, all kings shall fall down before Him.\" Whom, indeed, shall they all thus worship, except Christ? \"All nations shall serve Him.\"[fn-75-P7598_2177618:427-nf] To whom shall all thus do homage, but Christ? \"His name shall endure for ever.\" Whose name has this eternity of fame, but Christ's? \"Longer than the sun shall His name remain,\" for longer than the sun shall be the Word of God, even Christ. \"And in Him shall all nations be blessed.\"[fn-75-P7599_2177921:428-nf] In Solomon was no nation blessed; in Christ every nation. And what if the Psalm proves Him to be even God? \"They shall call Him blessed.\"[fn-76-P7600_2178079:429-nf] (On what ground? ) Because blessed Is the Lord God of Israel, who only doeth wonderful things.\"[fn-76-P7601_2178195:430-nf] \"Blessed also is His glorious name, and with His glory shall all the earth be filled.\"[fn-76-P7602_2178302:431-nf] On the contrary, Solomon (as I make bold to affirm) lost even the glory which he had from God, seduced by his love of women even into idolatry. And thus, the statement which occurs in about the middle of this Psalm, \"His enemies shall lick the dust\"[fn-76-P7603_2178572:432-nf] (of course, as having been, (to use the apostle's phrase, ) \"put under His feet\"[fn-76-P7604_2178672:433-nf] ), will bear upon the very object which I had in view, when I both introduced the Psalm, and insisted on my opinion of its sense,-namely, that I might demonstrate both the glory of His kingdom and the subjection of His enemies in pursuance of the Creator's own plans, with the view of laying down[fn-76-P7605_2178995:434-nf] this conclusion, that none but He can be believed to be the Christ of the Creator.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":110,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"62","folder":"ANF-03","text":"We have it on the true tradition[fn-79-P7952_2264515:757-nf] of the Church, that this epistle was sent to the Ephesians, not to the Laodiceans. Marcion, however, was very desirous of giving it the new rifle (of Laodicean),[fn-79-P7953_2264695:758-nf] as if he were extremely accurate in investigating such a point. But of what consequence are the titles, since in writing to a certain church the apostle did in fact write to all? It is certain that, whoever they were to whom he wrote,[fn-79-P7954_2264997:759-nf] he declared Him to be God in Christ with whom all things agree which are predicted. Now, to what god will most suitably belong all those things which relate to \"that good pleasure, which God hath purposed in the mystery of His will, that in the dispensation of the fulness of times He might recapitulate\" (if I may so say, according to the exact meaning of the Greek word[fn-79-P7955_2265389:760-nf] ) \"all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth,\"[fn-79-P7956_2265517:761-nf] but to Him whose are all things from their beginning, yea the beginning itself too; from whom issue the times and the dispensation of the fulness of times, according to which all things up to the very first are gathered up in Christ? What beginning, however, has the other god; that is to say, how can anything proceed from him, who has no work to show? And if there be no beginning, how can there be times? If no times, what fulness of times can there be? And if no fulness, what dispensation? Indeed, what has he ever done on earth, that any long dispensation of times to be fulfilled can be put to his account, for the accomplishment of all things in Christ, even of things in heaven? Nor can we possibly suppose that any things whatever have been at any time done in heaven by any other God than Him by whom, as all men allow, all things have been done on earth. Now, if it is impossible for all these things from the beginning to be reckoned to any other God than the Creator, who will believe that an alien god has recapitulated them in an alien Christ, instead of their own proper Author in His own Christ? If, again, they belong to the Creator, they must needs be separate from the other god; and if separate, then opposed to him. But then how can opposites be gathered together into him by whom they are in short destroyed? Again, what Christ do the following words announce, when the apostle says: \"That we should be to the praise of His glory, who first trusted in Christ? \"[fn-79-P7957_2267025:762-nf] Now who could have first trusted-i.e. previously trusted[fn-79-P7958_2267101:763-nf] -in God, before His advent, except the Jews to whom Christ was previously announced, from the beginning? He who was thus foretold, was also foretrusted. Hence the apostle refers the statement to himself, that is, to the Jews, in order that he may draw a distinction with respect to the Gentiles, (when he goes on to say: ) \"In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel (of your salvation); in whom ye believed, and were sealed with His Holy Spirit of promise.\"[fn-79-P7959_2267644:764-nf] Of what promise? That which was made through Joel: \"In the last days will I pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh,\"[fn-79-P7960_2267778:765-nf] that is, on all nations. Therefore the Spirit and the Gospel will be found in the Christ, who was foretrusted, because foretold. Again, \"the Father of glory\"[fn-79-P7961_2267956:766-nf] is He whose Christ, when ascending to heaven, is celebrated as \"the King of Glory\" in the Psalm: \"Who is this King of Glory? the Lord of Hosts, He is the King of Glory.\"[fn-79-P7962_2268146:767-nf] From Him also is besought \"the spirit of wisdom,\"[fn-79-P7963_2268217:768-nf] at whose disposal is enumerated that sevenfold distribution of the spirit of grace by Isaiah.[fn-79-P7964_2268330:769-nf] He likewise will grant \"the enlightenment of the eyes of the understanding,\"[fn-79-P7965_2268426:770-nf] who has also enriched our natural eyes with light; to whom, moreover, the blindness of the people is offensive: \"And who is blind, but my servants? ... yea, the servants of God have become blind.\"[fn-79-P7966_2268640:771-nf] In His gift, too, are \"the riches (of the glory) of His inheritance in the saints,\"[fn-79-P7967_2268754:772-nf] who promised such an inheritance in the call of the Gentiles: \"Ask of me, and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance.\"[fn-79-P7968_2268904:773-nf] It was He who \"wrought in Christ His mighty power, by raising Him from the dead, and setting Him at His own right hand, and putting all things under His feet\"[fn-79-P7969_2269081:774-nf] -even the same who said: \"Sit Thou on my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\"[fn-79-P7970_2269199:775-nf] For in another passage the Spirit says to the Father concerning the Son: \"Thou hast put all things under His feet.\"[fn-79-P7971_2269333:776-nf] Now, if from all these facts which are found in the Creator there is yet to be deduced[fn-79-P7972_2269440:777-nf] another god and another Christ, let us go in quest of the Creator. I suppose, forsooth,[fn-79-P7973_2269545:778-nf] we find Him, when he speaks of such as \"were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein they had walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, who worketh in the children of disobedience.\"[fn-79-P7974_2269792:779-nf] But Marcion must not here interpret the world as meaning the God of the world.[fn-79-P7975_2269893:780-nf] For a creature bears no resemblance to the Creator; the thing made, none to its Maker; the world, none to God. He, moreover, who is the Prince of the power of the ages must not be thought to be called the prince of the power of the air; for He who is chief over the higher powers derives no title from the lower powers, although these, too, may be ascribed to Him. Nor, again, can He possibly seem to be the instigator[fn-79-P7976_2270363:781-nf] of that unbelief which He Himself had rather to endure at the hand of the Jews and the Gentiles alike. We may therefore simply conclude that[fn-79-P7977_2270587:782-nf] these designations are unsuited to the Creator. There is another being to whom they are more applicable-and the apostle knew very well who that was. Who then is he? Undoubtedly he who has raised up \"children of disobedience\" against the Creator Himself ever since he took possession of that \"air\" of His; even as the prophet makes him say: \"I will set my throne above the stars; ... I will go up above the clouds; I will be like the Most High.\"[fn-79-P7978_2271057:783-nf] This must mean the devil, whom in another passage (since such will they there have the apostle's meaning to be) we shall recognize in the appellation the god of this world.[fn-79-P7979_2271297:784-nf] For he has filled the whole world with the lying pretence of his own divinity. To be sure,[fn-79-P7980_2271481:785-nf] if he had not existed, we might then possibly have applied these descriptions to the Creator. But the apostle, too, had lived in Judaism; and when he parenthetically observed of the sins (of that period of his life), \"in which also we all had our conversation in times past,\"[fn-79-P7981_2271798:786-nf] he must not be understood to indicate that the Creator was the lord of sinful men, and the prince of this air; but as meaning that in his Judaism he had been one of the children of disobedience, having the devil as his instigator-when he persecuted the church and the Christ of the Creator. Therefore he says: \"We also were the children of wrath,\" but \"by nature.\"[fn-79-P7982_2272182:787-nf] Let the heretic, however, not contend that, because the Creator called the Jews children, therefore the Creator is the lord of wrath.[fn-79-P7983_2272335:788-nf] For when (the apostle) says,\" We were by nature the children of wrath,\" inasmuch as the Jews were not the Creator's children by nature, but by the election of their fathers, he (must have) referred their being children of wrath to nature, and not to the Creator, adding this at lasts\" even as others,\"[fn-79-P7984_2272664:789-nf] who, of course, were not children of God. It is manifest that sins, and lusts of the flesh, and unbelief, and anger, are ascribed to the common nature of all mankind, the devil [however leading that nature astray,[fn-79-P7985_2272897:790-nf] which he has already infected with the implanted germ of sin. \"We,\" says he, \"are His workmanship, created in Christ.\"[fn-79-P7986_2273033:791-nf] It is one thing to make (as a workman), another thing to create. But he assigns both to One. Man is the workmanship of the Creator. He therefore who made man (at first), created him also in Christ. As touching the substance of nature, He \"made\" him; as touching the work of grace, He \"created\" him. Look also at what follows in connection with these words: \"Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which has the name of circumcision in the flesh made by the hand-that at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise,[fn-79-P7987_2273717:792-nf] having no hope, and without God in the world.\"[fn-79-P7988_2273817:793-nf] Now, without what God and without what Christ were these Gentiles? Surely, without Him to whom the commonwealth[fn-79-P7989_2273953:794-nf] of Israel belonged, and the covenants and the promise. \"But now in Christ,\" says he, \"ye who were sometimes far off are made nigh by His blood.\"[fn-79-P7990_2274153:795-nf] From whom were they far off before? From the privileges) whereof he speaks above, even tom the Christ of the Creator, from the commonwealth of Israel, from the covenants, from the hope of the promise, from God Himself. Since this is the case, the Gentiles are consequently now in Christ made nigh to these (blessings), from which they were once far off. But if we are in Christ brought so very nigh to the commonwealth of Israel, which comprises the religion of the divine Creator, and to the covenants and to the promise, yea to their very God Himself, it is quite ridiculous (to suppose that) the Christ of the other god has brought us to this proximity to the Creator from afar. The apostle had in mind that it had been predicted concerning the call of the Gentiles from their distant alienation in words like these: \"They who were far off from me have come to my righteousness.\"[fn-79-P7991_2275057:796-nf] For the Creator's righteousness no less than His peace was announced in Christ, as we have often shown already. Therefore he says: \"He is our peace, who hath made both one\"[fn-79-P7992_2275308:797-nf] -that is, the Jewish nation and the Gentile world. What is near, and what was far off now that \"the middle wall has been broken down\" of their \"enmity,\" (are made one) \"in His flesh.\"[fn-79-P7993_2275512:798-nf] But Marcion erased the pronoun His, that he might make the enmity refer to flesh, as if (the apostle spoke) of a carnal enmity, instead of the enmity which was a rival to Christ.[fn-79-P7994_2275711:799-nf] And thus you have (as I have said elsewhere) exhibited the stupidity of Pontus, rather than the adroitness of a Marrucinian,[fn-79-P7995_2275894:800-nf] for you here deny him flesh to whom in the verse above you allowed blood! Since, however, He has made the law obsolete[fn-79-P7996_2276098:801-nf] by His own precepts, even by Himself fulfilling the law (for superfluous is, \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" when He says, \"Thou shalt not look on a woman to lust after her; \"superfluous also is, \"Thou shalt do no murder,\" when He says, \"Thou shalt not speak evil of thy neighbour,\") it is impossible to make an adversary of the law out of one who so completely promotes it.[fn-79-P7997_2276496:802-nf] \"For to create[fn-79-P7998_2276531:803-nf] in Himself of twain,\" for He who had made is also the same who creates (just as we have found it stated above: \"For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus\"),[fn-79-P7999_2276788:804-nf] \"one new man, making peace\" (really new, and really man-no phantom-but new, and newly born of a virgin by the Spirit of God), \"that He might reconcile both unto God\"[fn-80-P8000_2276974:805-nf] (even the God whom both races had offended-both Jew and Gentile), \"in one body,\" says he, \"having in it slain the enmity by the cross.\"[fn-80-P8001_2277133:806-nf] Thus we find from this passage also, that there was in Christ a fleshly body, such as was able to endure the cross. \"When, therefore, He came and preached peace to them that were near and to them which were afar off,\" we both obtained \"access to the Father,\" being \"now no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God\" (even of Him from whom, as we have shown above, we were aliens, and placed far off), \"built upon the foundation of the apostles\"[fn-80-P8002_2277652:807-nf] -(the apostle added), \"and the prophets; \"these words, however, the heretic erased, forgetting that the Lord had set in His Church not only apostles, but prophets also. He feared, no doubt, that our building was to stand in Christ upon the foundation of the ancient prophets,[fn-80-P8003_2277951:808-nf] since the apostle himself never fails to build us up everywhere with (the words of) the prophets. For whence did he learn to call Christ \"the chief corner-stone,\"[fn-80-P8004_2278282:809-nf] but from the figure given him in the Psalm: \"The stone which the builders rejected is become the head (stone) of the corner? \"[fn-80-P8005_2278429:810-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":110,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"72","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In the cixth Psalm: \"Before the morning star I begat thee.

For it will be impossible for him not to call that evil to which he imputes evil. Now we lay down this principle,[fn-82-P8298_2348782:100-nf] that what is eternal cannot possibly admit of diminution and subjection, so as to be considered inferior to another co-eternal Being. So that we now affirm that evil is not even compatible with it,[fn-82-P8299_2348998:101-nf] since it is incapable of subjection, from the fact that it cannot in any wise be subject to any, because it is eternal. But inasmuch as, on other grounds,[fn-83-P8300_2349176:102-nf] it is evident what is eternal as God is the highest good, whereby also He alone is good-as being eternal, and therefore good-as being God, how can evil be inherent in Matter, which (since it is eternal) must needs be believed to be the highest good? Else if that which is eternal prove to be also capable of evil, this (evil) will be able to be also believed of God to His prejudice;[fn-83-P8301_2349574:103-nf] so that it is without adequate reason that he has been so anxious[fn-83-P8302_2349665:104-nf] to remove evil from God; since evil must be compatible with l an eternal Being, even by being made compatible with Matter, as Hermogenes makes it. But, as the argument now stands,[fn-83-P8303_2349862:105-nf] since what is eternal can be deemed evil, the evil must prove to be invincible and insuperable, as being eternal; and in that case[fn-83-P8304_2350010:106-nf] it will be in vain that we labour \"to put away evil from the midst of us; \"[fn-83-P8305_2350098:107-nf] in that case, moreover, God vainly gives us such a command and precept; nay more, in vain has God appointed any judgment at all, when He means, indeed,[fn-83-P8306_2350271:108-nf] to inflict punishment with injustice. But if, on the other hand, there is to be an end of evil, when the chief thereof, the devil, shall \"go away into the fire which God hath prepared for him and his angels\"[fn-83-P8307_2350547:109-nf] -having been first \"cast into the bottomless pit; \"[fn-83-P8308_2350621:110-nf] when likewise \"the manifestation of the children of God\"[fn-83-P8309_2350697:111-nf] shall have \"delivered the creature\"[fn-83-P8310_2350755:112-nf] from evil, which had been \"made subject to vanity; \"[fn-83-P8311_2350830:113-nf] when the cattle restored in the innocence and integrity of their nature[fn-83-P8312_2350924:114-nf] shall be at peace[fn-83-P8313_2350974:115-nf] with the beasts of the field, when also little children shall play with serpents;[fn-83-P8314_2351076:116-nf] when the Father shall have put beneath the feet of His Son His enemies,[fn-83-P8315_2351167:117-nf] as being the workers of evil,-if in this way an end is compatible with evil, it must follow of necessary that a beginning is also compatible with it; and Matter will turn out to have a beginning, by virtue of its having also an end.

But these writings of the apostles, though dear, are yet profound, and are so written that one who is not content with a superficial acquaintance, but desires to know them thoroughly, must not only read and hear them, but must have an expositor. Let us, then, study these various modes of speech as they are exemplified in the writings of men who, by reading the Scriptures, have attained to the knowledge of divine and saving truth, and have ministered it to the Church. Cyprian of blessed memory writes in the subdued style in his treatise on the sacrament of the cup. In this book he resolves the question, whether the cup of the Lord ought to contain water only, or water mingled with wine. But we must quote a passage by way of illustration. After the customary introduction, he proceeds to the discussion of the point in question. \"Observe\" he says, \"that we are instructed, in presenting the cup, to maintain the custom handed down to us from the Lord, and to do nothing that our Lord has not first done for us: so that the cup which is offered in remembrance of Him should be mixed with wine. For, as Christ says, 'I am the true vine,'[fn-54-P5429_2881459:55-nf] it follows that the blood of Christ is wine, not water; and the cup cannot appear to contain His blood by which we are redeemed and quickened, if the wine be absent; for by the wine is the blood of Christ typified, that blood which is foreshadowed and proclaimed in all the types and declarations of Scripture. For we find that in the book of Genesis this very circumstance in regard to the sacrament is foreshadowed, and our Lord's sufferings typically set forth, in the case of Noah, when he drank wine, and was drunken, and was uncovered within his tent, and his nakedness was exposed by his second son, and was carefully hidden by his elder and his younger sons.[fn-54-P5430_2882143:56-nf] It is not necessary to mention the other circumstances in detail, as it is only necessary to observe this point, that Noah, foreshadowing the future reality, drank, not water, but wine, and thus showed forth our Lord's passion. In the same way we see the sacrament of the Lord's supper prefigured in the case of Melchizedek the priest, according to the testimony of the Holy Scriptures, where it says: ' And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God. And he blessed Abraham.'[fn-54-P5431_2882697:57-nf] Now, that Melchizedek was a type of Christ, the Holy Spirit declares in the Psalms, where the Father addressing the Son says, 'Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.'[fn-54-P5432_2882907:58-nf] \"[fn-54-P5433_2882925:59-nf] In this passage, and in all of the letter that follows, the subdued style is maintained, as the reader may easily satisfy himself.","title":"Book IV","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":110,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_37_book_i","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"49","folder":"ANF-10","text":"But what is the bearing of all this for us?

Moreover Moses, when he commanded, \"Ye shall not have any graven or molten [image] for your God,\"[fn-33-P3341_567929:173-nf] did so that he might reveal a type of Jesus. Moses then makes a brazen serpent, and places it upon a beam,[fn-33-P3342_568097:174-nf] and by proclamation assembles the people. When, therefore, they were come together, they besought Moses that he would offer sacrifice[fn-33-P3343_568356:175-nf] in their behalf, and pray for their recovery. And Moses spake unto them, saying, \"When any one of you is bitten, let him come to the serpent placed on the pole; and let him hope and believe, that even though dead, it is able to give him life, and immediately he shall be restored.\"[fn-33-P3344_568691:176-nf] And they did so.

That they might know that they could not be saved unless they put their trust in Him.[fn-33-P3336_566992:168-nf] And in another prophet He declares, \"All day long I have stretched forth My hands to an unbelieving people, and one that gainsays My righteous way.\"[fn-33-P3337_567182:169-nf] And again Moses makes a type of Jesus, [signifying] that it was necessary for Him to suffer, [and also] that He would be the author of life[fn-33-P3338_567342:170-nf] [to others], whom they believed to have destroyed on the cross[fn-33-P3339_567458:171-nf] when Israel was failing. For since transgression was committed by Eve through means of the serpent, [the Lord] brought it to pass that every [kind of] serpents bit them, and they died,[fn-33-P3340_567673:172-nf] that He might convince them, that on account of their transgression they were given over to the straits of death. Moreover Moses, when he commanded, \"Ye shall not have any graven or molten [image] for your God,\"[fn-33-P3341_567929:173-nf] did so that he might reveal a type of Jesus. Moses then makes a brazen serpent, and places it upon a beam,[fn-33-P3342_568097:174-nf] and by proclamation assembles the people. When, therefore, they were come together, they besought Moses that he would offer sacrifice[fn-33-P3343_568356:175-nf] in their behalf, and pray for their recovery. And Moses spake unto them, saying, \"When any one of you is bitten, let him come to the serpent placed on the pole; and let him hope and believe, that even though dead, it is able to give him life, and immediately he shall be restored.\"[fn-33-P3344_568691:176-nf] And they did so. Thou hast in this also [an indication of] the glory of Jesus; for in Him and to Him are all things.[fn-33-P3345_568828:177-nf] What, again, says Moses to Jesus (Joshua) the son of Nave, when he gave him[fn-33-P3346_568929:178-nf] this name, as being a prophet, with this view only, that all the people might hear that the Father would reveal all things concerning His Son Jesus to the son[fn-33-P3347_569169:179-nf] of Nave? This name then being given him when he sent him to spy out the land, he said, \"Take a book into thy hands, and write what the Lord declares, that the Son of God will in the last days cut off from the roots all the house of Amalek.\"[fn-33-P3348_569505:180-nf] Behold again: Jesus who was manifested, both by type and in the flesh,[fn-33-P3349_569597:181-nf] is not the Son of man, but the Son of God. Since, therefore, they were to say that Christ was the son[fn-33-P3350_569728:182-nf] of David, fearing and understanding the error of the wicked, he saith, \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit at My right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\"[fn-33-P3351_569965:183-nf] And again, thus saith Isaiah, \"The Lord said to Christ,[fn-33-P3352_570058:184-nf] my Lord, whose right hand I have holden,[fn-33-P3353_570145:185-nf] that the nations should yield obedience before Him; and I will break in pieces the strength of kings.\"[fn-33-P3354_570291:186-nf] Behold how David calleth Him Lord and the Son of God.","title":"The Epistle of Barnabas","author":"Barnabas"},{"chapter":110,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"111","folder":"ANF-03","text":"We must after all this turn our attention to those scriptures also which forbid our belief in such a resurrection as is held by your Animalists (for I will not call them Spiritualists),[fn-98-P9874_2728553:129-nf] that it is either to be assumed as taking place now, as soon as men come to the knowledge of the truth, or else that it is accomplished immediately after their departure from this life. Now, forasmuch as the seasons of our entire hope have been fixed in the Holy Scripture, and since we are not permitted to place the accomplishment thereof, as I apprehend, previous to Christ's coming, our prayers are directed towards[fn-98-P9875_2729158:130-nf] the end of this world, to the passing away thereof at the great day of the Lord-of His wrath and vengeance-the last day, which is hidden (from all), and known to none but the Father, although announced beforehand by signs and wonders, and the dissolution of the elements, and the conflicts of nations. I would turn out the words of the prophets, if the Lord Himself had said nothing (except that prophecies were the Lord's own word); but it is more to my purpose that He by His own mouth confirms their statement. Being questioned by His disciples when those things were to come to pass which He had just been uttering about the destruction of the temple, He discourses to them first of the order of Jewish events until the overthrow of Jerusalem, and then of such as concerned all nations up to the very end of the world. For after He had declared that \"Jerusalem was to be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles should be fulfilled,\"[fn-98-P9876_2730138:131-nf] -meaning, of course, those which were to be chosen of God, and gathered in with the remnant of Israel-He then goes on to proclaim, against this world and dispensation (even as Joel had done, and Daniel, and all the prophets with one consent[fn-98-P9877_2730400:132-nf] ), that \"there should be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars, distress of nations with perplexity, the sea and the waves roaring, men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth.\"[fn-98-P9878_2730691:133-nf] \"For,\" says He, \"the powers of heaven shall be shaken; and then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds, with power and great glory. And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh.\"[fn-98-P9879_2730978:134-nf] He spake of its \"drawing nigh,\" not of its being present already; and of \"those things beginning to come to pass,\" not of their having happened: because when they have come to pass, then our redemption shall be at hand, which is said to be approaching up to that time, raising and exciting our minds to what is then the proximate harvest of our hope. He immediately annexes a parable of this in \"the trees which are tenderly sprouting into a flower-stalk, and then developing the flower, which is the precursor of the fruit.\"[fn-98-P9880_2731524:135-nf] \"So likewise ye,\" (He adds), \"when ye shall see all these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of heaven is nigh at hand.\"[fn-98-P9881_2731696:136-nf] \"Watch ye, therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all those things, and to stand before the Son of man; \"[fn-98-P9882_2731870:137-nf] that is, no doubt, at the resurrection, after all these things have been previously transacted. Therefore, although there is a sprouting in the acknowledgment of all this mystery, yet it is only in the actual presence of the Lord that the flower is developed and the fruit borne.

The same remark (I wish also to be formally) made by me with respect to the third degree in the Godhead, because I believe the Spirit to proceed from no other source than from the Father through the Son.[fn-104-P10422_2921796:33-nf] Look to it then, that it be not you rather who are destroying the Monarchy, when you overthrow the arrangement and dispensation of it, which has been constituted in just as many names as it has pleased God to employ. But it remains so firm and stable in its own state, notwithstanding the introduction into it of the Trinity, that the Son actually has to restore it entire to the Father; even as the apostle says in his epistle, concerning the very end of all: \"When He shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; for He must reign till He hath put all enemies under His feet; \"[fn-104-P10423_2922426:34-nf] following of course the words of the Psalm: \"Sit Thou on my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\"[fn-104-P10424_2922565:35-nf] \"When, however, all things shall be subdued to Him, (with the exception of Him who did put all things under Him, ) then shall the Son also Himself be subject unto Him who put all things under Him, that God may be all in all.\"[fn-104-P10425_2922807:36-nf] We thus see that the Son is no obstacle to the Monarchy, although it is now administered by[fn-104-P10426_2922923:37-nf] the Son; because with the Son it is still in its own state, and with its own state will be restored to the Father by the Son. No one, therefore, will impair it, on account of admitting the Son (to it), since it is certain that it has been committed to Him by the Father, and by and by has to be again delivered up by Him to the Father. Now, from this one passage of the epistle of the inspired apostle, we have been already able to show that the Father and the Son are two separate Persons, not only by the mention of their separate names as Father and the Son, but also by the fact that He who delivered up the kingdom, and He to whom it is delivered up-and in like manner, He who subjected (all things), and He to whom they were subjected-must necessarily be two different Beings.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":110,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"58","folder":"ANF-03","text":"It will be your duty, however, to adduce your proofs out of the Scriptures as plainly as we do, when we prove that He made His Word a Son to Himself.

Now, you who say that the Father is the same as the Son, do really make the same Person both to have sent forth from Himself (and at the same time to have gone out from Himself as) that Being which is God.

On your side, however, you must make Him out to be a liar, and an impostor, and a tamperer with His word, if, when He was Himself a Son to Himself, He assigned the part of His Son to be played by another, when all the Scriptures attest the clear existence of, and distinction in (the Persons of) the Trinity, and indeed furnish us with our Rule of faith, that He who speaks; and He of whom He speaks, and to whom He speaks, cannot possibly seem to be One and the Same.

Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity: therefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee or made Thee His Christ.\"[fn-105-P10556_2961814:140-nf] Now, since He here speaks to God, and affirms that God is anointed by God, He must have affirmed that Two are God, by reason of the sceptre's royal power. Accordingly, Isaiah also says to the Person of Christ: \"The Sabµans, men of stature, shall pass over to Thee; and they shall follow after Thee, bound in fetters; and they shall worship Thee, because God is in Thee: for Thou art our God, yet we knew it not; Thou art the God of Israel.\"[fn-105-P10557_2962277:141-nf] For here too, by saying, \"God is in Thee, and \"Thou art God,\" he sets forth Two who were God: (in the former expression in Thee, he means) in Christ, and (in the other he means) the Holy Ghost. That is a still grander statement which you will find expressly made in the Gospel: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\"[fn-105-P10558_2962669:142-nf] There was One \"who was,\" and there was another \"with whom\" He was. But I find in Scripture the name Lord also applied to them Both: \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on my right hand.\"[fn-105-P10559_2962876:143-nf] And Isaiah says this: \"Lord, who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? \"[fn-105-P10560_2963000:144-nf] Now he would most certainly have said Thine Arm, if he had not wished us to understand that the Father is Lord, and the Son also is Lord. A much more ancient testimony we have also in Genesis: \"Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.\"[fn-105-P10561_2963315:145-nf] Now, either deny that this is Scripture; or else (let me ask) what sort of man you are, that you do not think words ought to be taken and understood in the sense in which they are written, especially when they are not expressed in allegories and parables, but in determinate and simple declarations? If, indeed, you follow those who did not at the time endure the Lord when showing Himself to be the Son of God, because they would not believe Him to be the Lord, then (I ask you)call to mind along with them the passage where it is written, \"I have said, Ye are gods, and ye are children of the Most High; \"[fn-105-P10562_2963944:146-nf] and again, \"God standeth in the congregation of gods; \"[fn-105-P10563_2964022:147-nf] in order that, if the Scripture has not been afraid to designate as gods human beings, who have become sons of God by faith, you may be sure that the same Scripture has with greater propriety conferred the name of the Lord on the true and one-only Son of God. Very well! you say, I shall challenge you to preach from this day forth (and that, too, on the authority of these same Scriptures) two Gods and two Lords, consistently with your views. God forbid, (is my reply.) For we, who by the grace of God possess an insight into both the times and the occasions of the Sacred Writings, especially we who are followers of the Paraclete, not of human teachers, do indeed definitively declare that Two Beings are God, the Father and the Son, and, with the addition of the Holy Spirit, even Three, according to the principle of the divine economy, which introduces number, in order that the Father may not, as you perversely infer, be Himself believed to have been born and to have suffered, which it is not lawful to believe, forasmuch as it has not been so handed down. That there are, however, two Gods or two Lords, is a statement which at no time proceeds out of our mouth: not as if it were untrue that the Father is God, and the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God, and each is God; but because in earlier times Two were actually spoken of as God, and two as Lord, that when Christ should come He might be both acknowledged as God and designated as Lord, being the Son of Him who is both God and Lord. Now, if there were found in the Scriptures but one Personality of Him who is God and Lord, Christ would justly enough be inadmissible to the title of God and Lord: for (in the Scriptures) there was declared to be none other than One God and One Lord, and it must have followed that the Father should Himself seem to have come down (to earth), inasmuch as only One God and One Lord was ever read of (in the Scriptures), and His entire Economy would be involved in obscurity, which has been planned and arranged with so clear a foresight in His providential dispensation as matter for our faith. As soon, however, as Christ came, and was recognised by us as the very Being who had from the beginning[fn-105-P10564_2966241:148-nf] caused plurality[fn-105-P10565_2966272:149-nf] (in the Divine Economy), being the second from the Father, and with the Spirit the third, and Himself declaring and manifesting the Father more fully (than He had ever been before), the title of Him who is God and Lord was at once restored to the Unity (of the Divine Nature), even because the Gentiles would have to pass from the multitude of their idols to the One Only God, in order that a difference might be distinctly settled between the worshippers of One God and the votaries of polytheism. For it was only right that Christians should shine in the world as \"children of light,\" adoring and invoking Him who is the One God and Lord as \"the light of the world.\" Besides, if, from that perfect knowledge[fn-105-P10566_2966998:150-nf] which assures us that the title of God and Lord is suitable both to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, we were to invoke a plurality of gods and lords, we should quench our torches, and we should become less courageous to endure the martyr's sufferings, from which an easy escape would everywhere lie open to us, as soon as we swore by a plurality of gods and lords, as sundry heretics do, who hold more gods than One. I will therefore not speak of gods at all, nor of lords, but I shall follow the apostle; so that if the Father and the Son, are alike to be invoked, I shall call the Father \"God,\" and invoke Jesus Christ as \"Lord.\"[fn-105-P10567_2967668:151-nf] But when Christ alone (is mentioned), I shall be able to call Him \"God,\" as the same apostle says: \"Of whom is Christ, who is over all, God blessed for ever.\"[fn-105-P10568_2967845:152-nf] For I should give the name of\" sun\" even to a sunbeam, considered in itself; but if I were mentioning the sun from which the ray emanates, I certainly should at once withdraw the name of sun from the mere beam. For although I make not two suns, still I shall reckon both the sun and its ray to be as much two things and two forms[fn-105-P10569_2968195:153-nf] of one undivided substance, as God and His Word, as the Father and the Son.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":110,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":32,"source_paragraph":"96","folder":"ANF-03","text":"However, if you persist in pushing your views further, I shall find means of answering you with greater stringency, and of meeting you with the exclamation of the Lord Himself, so as to challenge you with the question, What is your inquiry and reasoning about that?

Why, then, said the Son to the mother, \"Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come?\" Our Lord Jesus Christ was both God and man. According as He was God, He had not a mother; according as He was man, He had. She was the mother, then, of His flesh, of His humanity, of the weakness which for our sakes He took upon Him. But the miracle which He was about to do, He was about to do according to His divine nature, not according to His weakness; according to that wherein He was God not according to that wherein He was born weak. But the weakness of God is stronger than men.[fn-5-P581_270807:9-nf] His mother then demanded a miracle of Him; but He, about to perform divine works, so far did not recognize a human womb; saying in effect, \"That in me which works a miracle was not born of thee, thou gavest not birth to my divine nature; but because my weakness was born of thee, I will recognize thee at the time when that same weakness shall hang upon the cross.\" This, indeed, is the meaning of \"Mine hour is not yet come.\" For then it was that He recognized, who, in truth, always did know. He knew His mother in predestination, even before He was born of her; even before, as God, He created her of whom, as man, He was to be created, He knew her as His mother: but at a certain hour in a mystery He did not recognize her; and at a certain hour which had not yet come, again in a mystery, He does recognize her. For then did He recognize her, when that to which she gave birth was a-dying. That by which Mary was made did not die, but that which was made of Mary; not the eternity of the divine nature, but the weakness of the flesh, was dying. He made that answer therefore, making a distinction in the faith of believers, between the who; and the how, He came. For whiIe He was God and the Lord of heaven and earth, He came by a mother who was a woman. In that He was Lord of the world, Lord of heaven and earth, He was, of course, the Lord of Mary also; but in that wherein it is said, \"Made of a woman, made under the law,\" He was Mary's son. The same both the Lord of Mary and the son of Mary; the same both the Creator of Mary and created from Mary. Marvel not that He was both son and Lord. For just as He is called the son of Mary, so likewise is He called the son of David; and son of David because son of Mary. Hear the apostle openly declaring, \"Who was made of the seed of David according to the flesh.\"[fn-5-P582_272647:10-nf] Hear Him also declared the Lord of David; let David himself declare this: \"The Lord said to my Lord, Sit Thou on my right hand.\"[fn-5-P583_272795:11-nf] And this passage Jesus Himself brought forward to the Jews, and refuted them from it.[fn-5-P584_272897:12-nf] How then was He both David's son and David's Lord? David's son according to the flesh, David's Lord according to His divinity; so also Mary's son after the flesh, and Mary's Lord after His majesty. Now as she was not the mother of His divine nature, whilst it was by His divinity the miracle she asked for would be wrought, therefore He answered her, \"Woman, what have I to do with thee?\" But think not that I deny thee to be my mother: \"Mine hour is not yet come;\" for in that hour I will acknowledge thee, when the weakness of which thou art the mother comes to hang on the cross. Let us prove the truth of this. When the Lord suffered, the same evangelist tells us, who knew the mother of the Lord, and who has given us to know about her in this marriage feast,-the same, I say, tells us, \"There was there near the cross the mother of Jesus; and Jesus saith to His mother, Woman, behold thy son! and to the disciple, Behold thy mother!\"[fn-5-P585_273853:13-nf] He commends His mother to the care of the disciple; commends His mother, as about to die before her, and to rise again before her death.

And then, what is said by David, `In the splendours of Thy holiness have I begotten Thee from the womb, before the morning star.[fn-46-P4604_973908:233-nf] The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek, '[fn-46-P4605_974061:234-nf] -does this not declare to you[fn-46-P4606_974109:235-nf] that [He was] from of old,[fn-46-P4607_974156:236-nf] and that the God and Father of all things intended Him to be begotten by a human womb? And speaking in other words, which also have been already quoted, [he says]: `Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of rectitude is the sceptre of Thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hast hated iniquity: therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows.

For the expression `it was cut out without hands' signified that it is not a work of man, but [a work] of the will of the Father and God of all things, who brought Him forth. And when Isaiah says, `Who shall declare His generation? 'he meant that His descent could not be declared. Now no one who is a man of men has a descent that cannot be declared.

And when Isaiah calls Him the Angel of mighty counsel,[fn-47-P4732_1014672:287-nf] did he not foretell Him to be the Teacher of those truths which He did teach when He came [to earth]? For He alone taught openly those mighty counsels which the Father designed both for all those who have been and shall be well-pleasing to Him, and also for those who have rebelled against His will, whether men or angels, when He said: `They shall come from the east [and from the west[fn-47-P4733_1015097:288-nf] ], and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven: but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness.'[fn-47-P4734_1015276:289-nf] And, `Many shall say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not eaten, and drunk, and prophesied, and cast out demons in Thy name?

For if the prophets declared obscurely that Christ would suffer, and thereafter be Lord of all, yet that [declaration] could not be understood by any man until He Himself persuaded the apostles that such statements were expressly related in the Scriptures. For He exclaimed before His crucifixion: `The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the Scribes and Pharisees, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.'[fn-47-P4738_1016529:293-nf] And David predicted that He would be born from the womb before sun and moon,[fn-47-P4739_1016626:294-nf] according to the Father's will, and made Him known, being Christ, as God strong and to be worshipped.\"","title":"Dialogue of Justin","author":"Justin Martyr"},{"chapter":110,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_48_dialogue_of_justin","source_chapter":120,"source_paragraph":"574","folder":"ANF-01","text":"\"So that you ought rather to desist from the love of strife, and repent before the great day of judgment come, wherein all those of your tribes who have pierced this Christ shall mourn as I have shown has been declared by the Scriptures.

How, then, could He talk with any one, or be seen by any one, or appear on the smallest portion of the earth, when the people at Sinai were not able to look even on the glory of Him who was sent from Him; and Moses himself could not enter into the tabernacle which he had erected, when it was filled with the glory of God; and the priest could not endure to stand before the temple when Solomon conveyed the ark into the house in Jerusalem which he had built for it?

And art not thou afraid as thou hearest the voice of the Divine Word? Art not thou distressed?

Come, come, O my young people! For if you become not again as little children, and be born again, as saith the Scripture, you shall not receive the truly existent Father, nor shall you ever enter into the kingdom of heaven.

Well, as I take it, then, when he is enrolled and made a citizen, and receives one to stand to him in the relation of father, then will he be occupied with the Father's concerns, then shall he be deemed worthy to be made His heir, then will he share the kingdom of the Father with His own dear Son. For this is the first-born Church, composed of many good children; these are \"the first-born enrolled in heaven, who hold high festival with so many myriads of angels.\" We, too, are first-born sons, who are reared by God, who are the genuine friends of the First-born, who first of all other men attained to the knowledge of God, who first were wrenched away from our sins, first severed from the devil.

But we shall not be wrong if we affirm the same thing also concerning the substance of matter, that God produced it. For we have learned from the Scriptures that God holds the supremacy over all things. But whence or in what way He produced it, neither has Scripture anywhere declared; nor does it become us to conjecture, so as, in accordance with our own opinions, to form endless conjectures concerning God, but we should leave such knowledge in the hands of God Himself. In like manner, also, we must leave the cause why, while all things were made by God, certain of His creatures sinned and revolted from a state of submission to God, and others, indeed the great majority, persevered, and do still persevere, in [willing] subjection to Him who formed them, and also of what nature those are who sinned, and of what nature those who persevere,-[we must, I say, leave the cause of these things] to God and His Word, to whom alone He said, \"Sit at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\"[fn-71-P7164_1869116:241-nf] But as for us, we still dwell upon the earth, and have not yet sat down upon His throne.

But they seem to me to have a wrong understanding of this passage also; for it has a religious and very orthodox sense, which had they understood, they would not have blasphemed the Lord of glory. For on comparing what has been above stated with this passage, they will find a great difference between them[fn-33-P3305_1303934:87-nf] . For what man of right understanding does not perceive, that what are created and made are external to the maker; but the Son, as the foregoing argument has shewn, exists not externally, but from the Father who begat Him? for man too both builds a house and begets a son, and no one would reverse things, and say that the house or the ship were begotten by the builder[fn-33-P3306_1304664:88-nf] , but the son was created and made by him; nor again that the house was an image of the maker, but the son unlike him who begat him; but rather he will confess that the son is an image of the father, but the house a work of art, unless his mind be disordered, and he beside himself. Plainly, divine Scripture, which knows better than any the nature of everything, says through Moses, of the creatures, `In the beginning God created the heaven and the earths[fn-33-P3307_1305155:89-nf] ;' but of the Son it introduces not another, but the Father Himself saying, `I have begotten Thee from the womb before the morning star[fn-33-P3308_1305307:90-nf] ;' and again, `Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee[fn-33-P3309_1305385:91-nf] .' And the Lord says of Himself in the Proverbs, `Before all the hills He begets me[fn-33-P3310_1305485:92-nf] ;' and concerning things originated and created John speaks, `All things were made by Him[fn-33-P3311_1305596:93-nf] ;' but preaching of the Lord, he says, `The Only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He declared Him[fn-33-P3312_1305726:94-nf] .' If then son, therefore not creature; if creature, not son; for great is the difference between them, and son and creature cannot be the same, unless His essence be considered to be at once from God, and external to God.","title":"De Decretis or Defence of the Nicene Definition","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":110,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_34_de_decretis_or_defence_of_the_nicene_definition","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"58","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"\"Next, I may reasonably turn to those who divide and cut to pieces and destroy that most sacred doctrine of the Church of God, the Divine Monarchy[fn-34-P3428_1364856:183-nf] , making it as it were three powers and partitive subsistences[fn-34-P3429_1366350:184-nf] and god-heads three. I am told that some among you who are catechists and teachers of the Divine Word, take the lead in this tenet, who are diametrically opposed, so to speak, to Sabellius's opinions; for he blasphemously says that the Son is the Father, and the Father the Son, but they in some sort preach three Gods, as dividing the sacred Monad into three subsistences foreign to each other and utterly separate. For it must needs be that with the God of the Universe, the Divine Word is united, and the Holy Ghost must repose[fn-34-P3430_1367654:185-nf] and habitate in God; thus in one as in a summit, I mean the God of the Universe, must the Divine Triad[fn-34-P3431_1367778:186-nf] be gathered up and brought together. For it is the doctrine of the presumptuous Marcion, to sever and divide the Divine Monarchy into three origins,-a devil's teaching, not that of Christ's true disciples and lovers of the Saviour's lessons, For they know well that a Triad is preached by divine Scripture, but that neither Old Testament nor New preaches three Gods. Equally must one censure those who hold the: Son to be a work, and consider that the Lord has come into being, as one of things which really came to be; whereas the divine oracles witness to a generation suitable to Him and becoming, but not to any fashioning or making. A blasphemy then is it, not ordinary, but even the highest, to say that the Lord is in any sort a handiwork. For if He came to be Son, once He was not; but He was always, if (that is) He be in the Father, as He says Himself, and if the Christ be Word and Wisdom and Power (which, as ye know, divine Scripture says), and these attributes be powers of God. If then the Son came into being, once these attributes were not; consequently there was a time, when God was without them; which is most absurd. And why say more on these points to you, men full of the Spirit and well aware of the absurdities which come to view from saying that the Son is a work? Not attending, as I consider, to this circumstance, the authors of this opinion have entirely missed the truth, in explaining, contrary to the sense of divine and prophetic Scripture in the passage, the words, `The Lord created me a beginning of His ways unto His works[fn-34-P3432_1371004:187-nf] .' For the sense of `He created,' as ye know, is not one, for we must understand `He created' in this place, as `He set over the works made by Him,' that is, `made by the Son Himself.' And `He created' here must not be taken for `made,' for creating differs from making. `Is not He thy Father that hath bought thee? hath He not made thee and created thee[fn-34-P3433_1371382:188-nf] ?'says Moses in his great song in Deuteronomy. And one may Say to them, O reckless men, is He a work, who is `the First-born of every creature, who is born from the womb before the morning star[fn-34-P3434_1371599:189-nf] ,' who said, as Wisdom, `Before all the hills He begets me[fn-34-P3435_1371692:190-nf] ?' And in many passages of the divine oracles is the Son said to have been[fn-34-P3436_1371790:191-nf] generated, but nowhere to have[fn-34-P3437_1371841:192-nf] come into being; which manifestly convicts those of misconception about the Lord's generation, who presume to call His divine and ineffable generation a making[fn-34-P3438_1372019:193-nf] . Neither then may we divide into three Godheads the wonderful and divine Monad; nor disparage with the name of `work' the dignity and exceeding majesty of the Lord; but we must believe in God the Father Almighty, and in Christ Jesus His Son, and in the Holy Ghost, and hold that to the God of the universe the Word is united[fn-34-P3439_1372363:194-nf] .

And the words, \"her child was caught up unto God and to His throne,\" signify that he who is always born of her is a heavenly king, and not an earthly; even as David also declared of old when he said, \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\"[fn-36-P3623_1142130:145-nf] \"And the dragon,\" he says, \"saw and persecuted the woman which brought forth the man-child.

But if, as we have quoted and declared above, He is Lord and King everlasting, seeing that Abraham worships Him as Lord, and Moses says, `Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven[fn-58-P5887_2350797:70-nf] ;' and David in the Psalms, `The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on My right hand[fn-58-P5888_2350899:71-nf] ;' and, `Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of Thy Kingdom[fn-58-P5889_2351022:72-nf] ;' and, `Thy Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom[fn-58-P5890_2351086:73-nf] ;' it is plain that even before He became man, He was King and Lord everlasting, being Image and Word of the Father. And the Word being everlasting Lord and King, it is very plain again that Peter said not that the Essence of the Son was made, but spoke of His Lordship over us, which `became' when He became man, and, redeeming all by the Cross, became Lord of all and King. But if they continue the argument on the ground of its being written, `He made,' not willing that `He made' should be taken in the sense of `He manifested,' either from want of apprehension, or from their Christ-opposing purpose, let them attend to another sound exposition of Peter's words. For he who becomes Lord of others, comes into the possession of beings already in existence; but if the Lord is Framer of all and everlasting King, and when He became man, then gained possession of us, here too is a way in which Peter's language evidently does not signify that the Essence of the Word is a work, but the after-subjection of all things, and the Saviour's Lordship which came to be over all. And this coincides with what we said before[fn-58-P5891_2352224:74-nf] ; for as we then introduced the words, `Become my God and defence,' and `the Lord became a refuge for the oppressed[fn-58-P5892_2352376:75-nf] ,' and it stood to reason that these expressions do not shew that God is originate, but that His beneficence `becomes' towards each individual, the same sense has the expression of Peter also.","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":110,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"29","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"14. For the Son of God indeed, being Himself the Word, is Lord of all; but we once were subject from the first to the slavery of corruption and the curse of the Law, then by degrees fashioning for ourselves things that were not, we served, as says the blessed Apostle, `them which by nature are no Gods[fn-58-P5894_2352927:76-nf] ,' and, ignorant of the true God, we preferred things that were not to the truth; but afterwards, as the ancient people when oppressed in Egypt groaned, so, when we too had the Law `engrafted[fn-58-P5895_2353136:77-nf] ' in us, and according to the unutterable sighings[fn-58-P5896_2353205:78-nf] of the Spirit made our intercession, `O Lord our God, take possession of us[fn-58-P5897_2353301:79-nf] ,' then, as `He became for a house of refuge' and a `God and defence,' so also He became our Lord. Nor did He then begin to be, but we began to have Him for our Lord. For upon this, God being good and Father of the Lord, in pity, and desiring to be known by all, makes His own Son put on Him a human body and become man, and be called Jesus, that in this body offering Himself for all, He might deliver all from false worship and corruption, and might Himself become of all Lord and King. His becoming therefore in this way Lord and King, this it is that Peter means by, `He hath made Him Lord,' and `hath sent Christ;' as much as to say, that the Father in making Him man (for to be made belongs to man), did not simply make Him man, but has made Him in order to His being Lord of all men, and to His hallowing all through the Anointing. For though the Word existing in the form of God took a servant's form, yet the assumption of the flesh did not make a servant[fn-58-P5898_2354290:80-nf] of the Word, who was by nature Lord; but rather, not only was it that emancipation of all humanity which takes place by the Word, but that very Word who was by nature Lord, and was then made man, hath by means of a servant's form been made Lord of all and Christ, that is, in order to hallow all by the Spirit. And as God, when `becoming a God and defence,' and saying, `I will be a God to them,' does not then become God more than before, nor then begins to become God, but, what He ever is, that He then becomes to those who need Him, when it pleaseth Him, so Christ also being by nature Lord and King everlasting, does not become Lord more than He was at the time He is sent forth, nor then begins to be Lord and King, but what He is ever, that He then is made according to the flesh; and, having redeemed all, He becomes thereby again Lord of quick and dead. For Him henceforth do all things serve, and this is David's meaning in the Psalm, `The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on My right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool[fn-58-P5899_2355618:81-nf] .' For it was fitting that the redemption should take place through none other than Him who is the Lord by nature, lest, though created by the Son, we should name another Lord, and fall into the Arian and Greek folly, serving the creature beyond the all-creating God[fn-59-P5900_2355901:82-nf] .","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":110,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"31","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"16. Peter then, having learned this from the Saviour, in both points set the Jews right, saying, \"O Jews, the divine Scriptures announce that Christ cometh, and you consider Him a mere man as one of David's descendants, whereas what is written of Him shews Him to be not such as you say, but rather announces Him as Lord and God, and immortal, and dispenser of life. For Moses has said, `Ye shall see your Life hanging before your eyes[fn-59-P5905_2357428:85-nf] .' And David in the hundred and ninth Psalm, `The Lord said unto My Lord, Sit Thou on My right hand, till I make Thine enemies Thy footstool[fn-59-P5906_2357667:86-nf] ;' and in the fifteenth, `Thou shalt not leave my soul in hades, neither shalt Thou suffer Thy Holy One to see corruption[fn-59-P5907_2357805:87-nf] .' Now that these passages have not David for their scope he himself witnesses, avowing that He who was coming was His own Lord. Nay you yourselves know that He is dead, and His remains are with you. That the Christ then must be such as the Scriptures say, you will plainly confess yourselves. For those announcements come from God, and in them falsehood cannot be. If then ye can state that such a one has come before, and can prove him God from the signs and wonders which he did, ye have reason for maintaining the contest, but if ye are not able to prove His coming, but are expecting such an one still, recognise the true season from Daniel, for his words relate to the present time. But if this present season be that which was of old, afore-announced, and ye have seen what has taken place among us, be sure that this Jesus, whom ye crucified, this is the expected Christ. For David and all the Prophets died, and the sepulchres of all are with you, but that Resurrection which has now taken place, has shewn that the scope of these passages is Jesus. For the crucifixion is denoted by `Ye shall see your Life hanging,' and the wound in the side by the spear answers to `He was led as a sheep to the slaughter[fn-59-P5908_2359040:88-nf] ,' and the resurrection, nay more, the rising of the ancient dead from out their sepulchres (for these most of you have seen), this is, `Thou shall not leave My soul in hades,' and `He swallowed up death in strength[fn-59-P5909_2359274:89-nf] ,' and again, `God will wipe away.' For the signs which actually took place shew that He who was in a body was God, and also the Life and Lord of death. For it became the Christ, when giving life to others, Himself not to be detained by death; but this could not have happened, had He, as you suppose, been a mere man. But in truth He is the Son of God, for men are all subject to death. Let no one therefore doubt, but the whole house of Israel know assuredly that this Jesus, whom ye saw in shape a man, doing signs and such works, as no one ever yet had done, is Himself the Christ and Lord of all. For though made man, and called Jesus, as we said before, He received no loss by that human passion, but rather, in being made man, He is manifested as Lord of quick and dead. For since, as the Apostle said, `in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe[fn-59-P5910_2360230:90-nf] .' And so, since we men would not acknowledge God through His Word, nor serve the Word of God our natural Master, it pleased God to shew in man His own Lordship, and so to draw all men to Himself. But to do this by a mere man be-seemed not[fn-59-P5911_2360490:91-nf] ; lest, having man for our Lord, we should become worshippers of man[fn-59-P5912_2360915:92-nf] . Therefore the Word Himself became flesh, and the Father called His Name Jesus, and so `made' Him Lord and Christ, as much as to say, `He made Him to rule and to reign;' that while in the Name of Jesus, whom ye crucified, every knee bows, we may acknowledge as Lord and King both the Son and through Him the Father.\"","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":110,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_62_discourse_iv","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"32","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"24.

My Well-beloved hath a vineyard[fn-72-P7220_2869422:101-nf] ;' Who is this `Well-beloved' but the Only-begotten Son? as also in the hundred and ninth, `From the womb I begat Thee before the morning star[fn-72-P7221_2869582:102-nf] ,' concerning which I shall speak afterwards; and in the Proverbs, `Before the hills He begat me;' and in Daniel, `And the form of the Fourth is like the Son of God[fn-72-P7222_2869770:103-nf] ;' and many others. If then from the Old be ancientness, ancient must be the Son, who is clearly described in the Old Testament in many places. `Yes,' they say, `so it is, but it must be taken prophetically.' Therefore also the Word must be said to be spoken of prophetically; for this is not to be taken one way, that another. For if `Thou art My Son' refer to the future, so does `By the Word of the Lord were the heavens established;' for it is not said `were brought to be,' nor `He made.' But that `established' refers to the future, it states elsewhere: `The Lord reigned[fn-72-P7223_2870391:104-nf] ,' followed by `He so established the earth that it can never be moved.' And if the words in the forty-fourth Psalm `for My Well-beloved' refer to the future, so does what follows upon them, `My heart uttered a good Word.' And if `From the womb' relates to a man, therefore also `From the heart.' For if the womb is human, so is the heart corporeal. But if what is from the heart is eternal, then what is `From the womb' is eternal. And if the `Only-begotten' is `in the bosom,' therefore the `Well-beloved' is `in the bosom.' For `Only-begotten' and `Well-beloved' are the same, as in the words `This is My Well-beloved Son[fn-72-P7224_2871046:105-nf] .' For not as wishing to signify His love towards Him did He say `Well-beloved,' as if it might appear that He hated others, but He made plain thereby His being Only-begotten, that He might shew that He alone was from Him. And hence the Word, with a view of conveying to Abraham the idea of `Only-begotten,' says, `Offer thy son thy well-beloved[fn-72-P7225_2871455:106-nf] ;' but it is plain to any one that Isaac was the only son from Sara. The Word then is Son, not lately come to be, or named Son, but always Son. For if not Son, neither is He Word; and if not Word, neither is He Son. For that which is from the father is a son; and what is from the Father, but that Word that went forth from the heart, and was born from the womb? for the Father is not Word, nor the Word Father, but the one is Father, and the other Son; and one begets, and the other is begotten.","title":"Discourse IV","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":110,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_175_sermon_iii_on_his_birthday_iii_delivered_on_the_anniversary_of_his_elevation_to_the_pontificate_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"As often as God's mercy deigns to bring round the day of His gifts to us, there is, dearly-beloved, just and reasonable cause for rejoicing, if only our appointment to the office be referred to the praise of Him who gave it.

For her virginity fecundated by the Holy Spirit at one and the same time brought forth without trace of corruption both the offspring and the Maker of her race.

In Him,[fn-74-P7464_2273915:14-nf] therefore, God has opened an entrance to all the sons of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in order that they may be in the faith of profession towards Him,[fn-74-P7465_2274086:15-nf] and have life and salvation in His name. Turn, therefore, and enter into the joy of your father Abraham, because God hath fulfilled what He promised to him. Whence also the prophet says, The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedec.[fn-74-P7466_2274483:16-nf] For a priest He became upon the cross, when He offered the whole burnt-offering of His own body and blood as a sacrifice for all the world.","title":"Acts of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul","author":"Apocrypha of the New Testament"}]
