He will be mindful for\never of his covenant:","He will shew forth to his people the power of his works.","That he may give them the inheritance of the Gentiles:  the works\nof his hands are truth and judgment.","All his commandments are faithful:  confirmed for ever and ever,\nmade in truth and equity.","He hath sent redemption to his people:  he hath commanded his\ncovenant for ever.  Holy and terrible is his name:","The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.  A good\nunderstanding to all that do it:  his praise continueth for ever and\never."]}
