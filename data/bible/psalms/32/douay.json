{"verses":["A psalm for David.  Rejoice in the Lord, O ye just:  praise\nbecometh the upright.","Give praise to the Lord on the harp; sing to him with the\npsaltery, the instrument of ten strings.","Sing to him a new canticle, sing well unto him with a loud noise.","For the word of the Lord is right, and all his works are done\nwith faithfulness.","He loveth mercy and judgment; the earth is full of the mercy of\nthe Lord.","By the word of the Lord the heavens were established; and all the\npower of them by the spirit of his mouth:","Gathering together the waters of the sea, as in a vessel; laying\nup the depths in storehouses.","Let all the earth fear the Lord, and let all the inhabitants of\nthe world be in awe of him.","For he spoke and they were made:  he commanded and they were\ncreated.","The Lord bringeth to nought the counsels of nations; and he\nrejecteth the devices of people, and casteth away the counsels of\nprinces.","But the counsel of the Lord standeth for ever:  the thoughts of\nhis heart to all generations.","Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord:  the people whom he\nhath chosen for his inheritance.","The Lord hath looked from heaven:  he hath beheld all the sons of\nmen.","From his habitation which he hath prepared, he hath looked upon\nall that dwell on the earth.","He who hath made the hearts of every one of them:  who\nunderstandeth all their works.","The king is not saved by a great army:  nor shall the giant be\nsaved by his own great strength.","Vain is the horse for safety:  neither shall he be saved by the\nabundance of his strength.","Behold the eyes of the Lord are on them that fear him:  and on\nthem that hope in his mercy.","To deliver their souls from death; and feed them in famine.","Our soul waiteth for the Lord:  for he is our helper and\nprotector.","For in him our heart shall rejoice:  and in his holy name we have\ntrusted.","Let thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us, as we have hooped in thee."]}
