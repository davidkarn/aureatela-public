[{"chapter":113,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf1_09_npnf1_09_13_letter_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"2","folder":"NPNF1-09","text":"\"Oh! that my head were water, and mine eyes a fountain of tears!\"[fn-6-P605_328665:1-nf] it is seasonable for me to utter these words now, yea much more than for the prophet in his time. For although I am not about to mourn over many cities, or whole nations, yet shall I mourn over a soul which is of equal value with many such nations, yea even more precious. For if one man who does the will of God is better than ten thousand transgressors, then thou wast formerly better than ten thousand Jews. Wherefore no one would now blame me if I were to compose more lamentations than those which are contained in the prophet, and to utter complaints yet more vehement. For it is not the overthrow of a city which I mourn, nor the captivity of wicked then, but the desolation of a sacred soul, the destruction and effacement of a Christ-bearing temple.[fn-6-P606_329440:2-nf] For would not any one who knew in the days of its glory that well-ordered mind of thine which the devil has now set on fire, groan, imitating the lamentation of the prophet; when he hears that barbarian hands have defiled the holy of holies, and have set fire to all things and burned them up, the cherubim, the ark, the mercy seat, the tables of stone, the golden pot? For this calamity is bitterer, yea bitterer than that, in proportion as the pledges deposited in thy soul were far more precious than those. This temple is holier than that; for it glistened not with gold and silver, but with the grace of the Spirit, and in place of the ark and the cherubim, it had Christ, and His Father, and the Paraclete seated within. But now all is changed, and the temple is desolate, and bare of its former beauty and comeliness, unadorned with its divine and unspeakable adornments, destitute of all security and protection; it has neither door nor bolt, and is laid open to all manner of soul-destroying and shameful thoughts; and if the thought of arrogance or fornication, or avarice, or any more accursed than these, wish to enter in there is no one to hinder them; whereas formerly, even as the Heaven is inaccessible to all these, so also was the purity of thy soul. Now perhaps I shall seem to say what is incredible to some who now witness thy desolation and overthrow; for on this account I wail and mourn, and shall not cease doing so, until I see thee again established in thy former lustre. For although this seems to be impossible to men, yet to God all things are possible. For it is He \"who raiseth the poor from the earth, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set him with the princes, even with the princes of his people.\" It is He \"who makes the barren woman to dwell at home, a mother rejoicing over her children.\"[fn-6-P607_331533:3-nf] Do not then despair of the most perfect change. For if the devil had such great power as to cast thee down from that pinnacle and height of virtue into the extremity of evil doing, much more will God be able to draw thee up again to thy former confidence; and not only indeed to make you what you were before, but even much happier. Only be not downcast, nor fling away good hopes, nor fall into the condition of the ungodly. For it is not the multitude of sins which is wont to plunge men into despair, but impiety of soul. Therefore Solomon did not make the unqualified statement \"every one who has entered into the den of the wicked, despiseth;\" but only \"he who is ungodly.\"[fn-6-P608_332232:4-nf] For it is such persons only who are affected in this way when they have entered the den of the wicked. And this it is which does not suffer them to look up, and re-ascend to the position from which they fell. For this accursed thought pressing down like some yoke upon the neck of the soul, and so forcing it to stoop, hinders it from looking up to the Master. Now it is the part of a brave and excellent man to break this yoke in pieces, to shake off the tormentor fastened upon him; and to utter the words of the prophet, \"As the eyes of a maiden look unto the hands of her mistress, even so our eyes look unto the Lord our God until He have mercy upon us. Have pity upon us, O Lord, have pity upon us, for we have been utterly filled with contempt.\"[fn-6-P609_333010:5-nf] Truly divine are these precepts, and decrees of the highest form of spiritual wisdom. We have been filled, it is said, with contempt, and have undergone countless distresses; nevertheless we shall not desist from looking up to God, neither shall we cease praying to him until He has received our petition. For this is the mark of a noble soul, not to be cast down, nor be dismayed at the multitude of the calamities which oppress it, nor to withdraw, after praying many times without success, but to persevere, until He have mercy upon us, even as the blessed David saith.","title":"Letter I.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":113,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_110_tractate_cv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"1.

From usury and injustice shall He redeem their souls, and in His sight shall their name be honoured.\"[fn-57-P5741_1746542:464-nf] Again: \"The wicked shall be turned into hell, even all the nations that forget God; because the needy shall not alway be forgotten; the endurance of the poor shall not perish for ever.\"[fn-57-P5742_1746758:465-nf] Again: \"Who is like unto the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high, and yet looketh on the humble things that are in heaven and on earth!-who raiseth up the needy from off the ground, and out of the dunghill exalteth the poor; that He may set him with the princes of His people,\"[fn-57-P5743_1747058:466-nf] that is, in His own kingdom. And likewise earlier, in the book of Kings,[fn-57-P5744_1747154:467-nf] Hannah the mother of Samuel gives glory to God in these words: \"He raiseth the poor man from the ground, and the beggar, that He may set him amongst the princes of His people (that is, in His own kingdom), and on thrones of glory\" (even royal ones).[fn-57-P5745_1747472:468-nf] And by Isaiah how He inveighs against the oppressors of the needy \"What mean ye that ye set fire to my vineyard, and that the spoil of the poor is in your houses? Wherefore do ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the face of the needy? \"[fn-57-P5746_1747733:469-nf] And again: \"Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees; for in their decrees they decree wickedness, turning aside the needy from judgment, and taking away their rights from the poor of my people.\"[fn-57-P5747_1747959:470-nf] These righteous judgments He requires for the fatherless also, and the widows, as well as for consolation[fn-57-P5748_1748086:471-nf] to the very needy themselves. \"Do justice to the fatherless, and deal justly with the widow; and come, let us be reconciled,[fn-57-P5749_1748227:472-nf] saith the Lord.\"[fn-57-P5750_1748356:473-nf] To him, for whom in every stage of lowliness there is provided so much of the Creator's compassionate regard, shall be given that kingdom also which is promised by Christ, to whose merciful compassion belong, and for a great while have belonged,[fn-57-P5751_1748625:474-nf] those to whom the promise is made. For even if you suppose that the promises of the Creator were earthly, but that Christ's are heavenly, it is quite clear that heaven has been as yet the property of no other God whatever, than Him who owns the earth also; quite clear that the Creator has given even the lesser promises (of earthly blessing), in order that I may more readily believe Him concerning His greater promises (of heavenly blessings) also, than (Marcion's god), who has never given proof of his liberality by any preceding bestowal of minor blessings. \"Blessed are they that hunger, for they shall be filled.\"[fn-57-P5752_1749273:475-nf] I might connect this clause with the former one, because none but the poor and needy suffer hunger, if the Creator had not specially designed that the promise of a similar blessing should serve as a preparation for the gospel, that so men might know it to be His.[fn-57-P5753_1749557:476-nf] For thus does He say, by Isaiah, concerning those whom He was about to call from the ends of the earth-that is, the Gentiles: \"Behold, they shall come swiftly with speed: \"[fn-57-P5754_1749779:477-nf] swiftly, because hastening towards the fulness of the times; with speed, because unclogged by the weights of the ancient law. They shall neither hunger nor thirst. Therefore they shall be filled,-a promise which is made to none but those who hunger and thirst. And again He says: \"Behold, my servants shall be filled, but ye shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty.\"[fn-57-P5755_1750199:478-nf] As for these oppositions, we shall see whether they are not premonitors of Christ.[fn-57-P5756_1750303:479-nf] Meanwhile the promise of fulness to the hungry is a provision of God the Creator. \"Blessed are they that weep, for they shall laugh.\"[fn-57-P5757_1750473:480-nf] Turn again to the passage of Isaiah: \"Behold, my servants shall exult with joy, but ye shall be ashamed; behold, my servants shall be glad, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart.\"[fn-57-P5758_1750672:481-nf] And recognise these oppositions also in the dispensation of Christ. Surely gladness and joyous exultation is promised to those who are in an opposite condition-to the sorrowful, and sad, and anxious. Just as it is said in the 125th Psalm: \"They who sow in tears shall reap in joy.\"[fn-57-P5759_1750979:482-nf] Moreover, laughter is as much an accessory to the exulting and glad, as weeping is to the sorrowful and grieving. Therefore the Creator, in foretelling matters for laughter and tears, was the first who said that those who mourned should laugh. Accordingly, He who began (His course) with consolation for the poor, and the humble, and the hungry, and the weeping, was at once eager[fn-57-P5760_1751437:483-nf] to represent Himself as Him whom He had pointed out by the mouth of Isaiah: \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the poor.\"[fn-57-P5761_1751633:484-nf] \"Blessed are the needy, because theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\"[fn-57-P5762_1751719:485-nf] \"He hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted.\"[fn-57-P5763_1751788:486-nf] \"Blessed are they that hunger, for they shall be filled.\"[fn-57-P5764_1751866:487-nf] \"To comfort all that mourn.\"[fn-57-P5765_1751915:488-nf] \"Blessed are they that weep, for they shall laugh.\"[fn-57-P5766_1751987:489-nf] \"To give unto them that mourn in Sion, beauty (or glory) for ashes, and the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.\"[fn-57-P5767_1752164:490-nf] Now since Christ, as soon as He entered on His course,[fn-57-P5768_1752239:491-nf] fulfilled such a ministration as this, He is either, Himself, He who predicted His own coming to do all this; or else if he is not yet come who predicted this, the charge to Marcion's Christ must be a ridiculous one (although I should perhaps add a necessary[fn-57-P5769_1752522:492-nf] one), which bade him say, \"Blessed shall ye be, when men shall bate you, and shall reproach you, and shall cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.\"[fn-57-P5770_1752754:493-nf] In this declaration there is, no doubt, an exhortation to patience. Well, what did the Creator say otherwise by Isaiah? \"Fear ye not the reproach of men, nor be diminished by their contempt.\"[fn-57-P5771_1752966:494-nf] What reproach? what contempt? That which was to be incurred for the sake of the Son of man. What Son of man? He who (is come) according to the Creator's will. Whence shall we get our proof? From the very cutting off, which was predicted against Him; as when He says by Isaiah to the Jews, who were the instigators of hatred against Him: \"Because of you, my name is blasphemed amongst the Gentiles; \"[fn-57-P5772_1753400:495-nf] and in another passage: \"Lay the penalty on[fn-57-P5773_1753464:496-nf] Him who surrenders[fn-57-P5774_1753499:497-nf] His own life, who is held in contempt by the Gentiles, whether servants or magistrates.\"[fn-57-P5775_1753610:498-nf] Now, since hatred was predicted against that Son of man who has His mission from the Creator, whilst the Gospel testifies that the name of Christians, as derived from Christ, was to be hated for the Son of man's sake, because He is Christ, it determines the point that that was the Son of man in the matter of hatred who came according to the Creator's purpose, and against whom the hatred was predicted. And even if He had not yet come, the hatred of His name which exists at the present day could not in any case have possibly preceded Him who was to bear the name.[fn-57-P5776_1754316:499-nf] But He has both suffered the penalty[fn-57-P5777_1754378:500-nf] in out presence, and surrendered His life, laying it down for our sakes, and is held in contempt by the Gentiles. And He who was born (into the world) will be that very Son of man on whose account our name also is rejected.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":113,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":30,"source_paragraph":"106","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Justly, therefore, was the hypocrisy of the Pharisees displeasing to Him, loving God as they did with their lips, but not with their heart. \"Beware,\" He says to the disciples, \"of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy,\" not the proclamation of the Creator. The Son hates those who refused obedience[fn-64-P6458_1904078:1138-nf] to the Father; nor does He wish His disciples to show such a disposition towards Him-not (let it be observed) towards another god, against whom such hypocrisy indeed might have been admissible, as that which He wished to guard His disciples against. It is the example of the Pharisees which He forbids. It was in respect of Him against whom the Pharisees were sinning that (Christ) now forbade His disciples to offend. Since, then, He had censured their hypocrisy, which covered the secrets of the heart, and obscured with superficial offices the mysteries of unbelief, because (while holding the key of knowledge) it would neither enter in itself, nor permit others to enter in, He therefore adds, \"There is nothing covered that shall not be revealed; neither hid, which shall not be known,\"[fn-64-P6459_1904892:1139-nf] in order that no one should suppose that He was attempting the revelation and the recognition of an hitherto unknown and hidden god. When He remarks also on their murmurs and taunts, in saying of Him, \"This man casteth out devils only through Beelzebub,\" He means that all these imputations would come forth to the light of day, and be in the mouths of men in consequence of the promulgation of the Gospel. He then turns to His disciples with these words, \"I say unto you, my friends, Be not afraid of them which can only kill the body, and after that have no more power over you.\"[fn-64-P6460_1905496:1140-nf] They will, however, find Isaiah had already said, \"See how the just man is taken away, and no man layeth it to heart.\"[fn-64-P6461_1905637:1141-nf] \"But I will show you whom ye shall fear: fear Him who, after He hath killed, hath power to cast into hell\" (meaning, of course, the Creator); \"yea, I say unto you, fear Him.\"[fn-64-P6462_1905836:1142-nf] Now, it would here be enough for my purpose that He forbids offence being given to Him whom He orders to be feared; and that He orders Him to be respected[fn-64-P6463_1906013:1143-nf] whom He forbids to be offended; and that He who gives these commands belongs to that very God for whom He procures this fear, this absence of offence, and this respect. But this conclusion I can draw also from the following words: \"For I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before God.\"[fn-64-P6464_1906360:1144-nf] Now they who shall confess Christ will have to be slain[fn-64-P6465_1906438:1145-nf] before men, but they will have nothing more to suffer after they have been put to death by them. These therefore will be they whom He forewarns above not to be afraid of being only killed; and this forewarning He offers, in order that He might subjoin a clause on the necessity of confessing Him: \"Every one that denieth me before men shall be denied before God\"[fn-64-P6466_1906827:1146-nf] -by Him, of course, who would have confessed him, if he had only confessed God. Now, He who will confess the confessor is the very same God who will also deny the denier of Himself. Again, if it is the confessor who will have nothing to fear after his violent death,[fn-64-P6467_1907116:1147-nf] it is the denier to whom everything will become fearful after his natural death. Since, therefore, that which will have to be feared after death, even the punishment of hell, belongs to the Creator, the denier, too, belongs to the Creator. As with the denier, however, so with the confessor: if he should deny God, he will plainly have to suffer from God, although from men he had nothing more to suffer after they had put him to death. And so Christ is the Creator's, because He shows that all those who deny Him ought to fear the Creator's hell. After deterring His disciples from denial of Himself, He adds an admonition to fear blasphemy: \"Whosoever shall speak against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him.\"[fn-64-P6468_1907939:1148-nf] Now, if both the remission and the retention of sin savour of a judicial God, the Holy Ghost, who is not to be blasphemed, will belong to Him, who will not forgive the, blasphemy; just as He who, in the preceding passage, was not to be denied, belonged to, Him who would, after He had killed, also cast into hell. Now, since it is Christ who averts blasphemy from the Creator, I am at a loss to know in what manner His adversary.[fn-64-P6469_1908392:1149-nf] could have come. Else, if by these sayings He throws a black cloud of censure[fn-64-P6470_1908532:1150-nf] over the severity of Him who will not forgive blasphemy and will kill even to hell, it follows that the very spirit of that rival god may be blasphemed with impunity, and his Christ denied; and that there is no difference, in fact, between worshipping and despising him; but that, as there is no punishment for the contempt, so there is no reward for the worship, which men need expect. When \"brought before magistrates,\" and examined, He forbids them \"to take thought how they shall answer; \"\"for,\" says He, \"the Holy Ghost shall teach you in that very hour what ye ought to say.\"[fn-64-P6471_1909133:1151-nf] If such an injunction[fn-64-P6472_1909182:1152-nf] as this comes from the Creator, the precept will only be His by whom an example was previously given. The prophet Balaam, in Numbers, when sent forth by king Balak to curse lsrµl, with whom he was commencing war, was at the same moment[fn-64-P6473_1909439:1153-nf] filled with the Spirit. Instead of the curse which he was come to pronounce, he uttered the blessing which the Spirit at that very hour inspired him with; having previously declared to the king's messengers, and then to the king himself, that he could only speak forth that which God should put into his mouth.[fn-64-P6474_1909766:1154-nf] The novel doctrines of the new Christ are such as the Creator's servants initiated long before! But see how clear a difference there is between the example of Moses and of Christ.[fn-64-P6475_1909972:1155-nf] Moses voluntarily interferes with brothers[fn-64-P6476_1910048:1156-nf] who were quarrelling, and chides the offender: \"Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? \"He is, however, rejected by him: \"Who made thee a prince or a judge over us? \"[fn-64-P6477_1910251:1157-nf] Christ, on the contrary, when requested by a certain man to compose a strife between him and his brother about dividing an inheritance, refused His assistance, although in so honest a cause. Well, then, my Moses is better than your Christ, aiming as he did at the peace of brethren, and obviating their wrong. But of course the case must be different with Christ, for he is the Christ of the simply good and non-judicial god. \"Who,\" says he, \"made me a judge over you? \"[fn-64-P6478_1910747:1158-nf] No other word of excuse was he able to find, without using[fn-64-P6479_1910834:1159-nf] that with which the wicked, man and impious brother had rejected[fn-64-P6480_1910921:1160-nf] the defender of probity and piety! In short, he approved of the excuse, although a bad one, by his use of it; and of the act, although a bad one, by his refusal to make peace between brothers. Or rather, would He not show His resentment[fn-64-P6481_1911222:1161-nf] at the rejection of Moses with such a word? And therefore did He not wish in a similar case of contentious brothers, to confound them with the recollection of so harsh a word? Clearly so. For He had Himself been present in Moses, who heard such a rejection-even He, the Spirit of the Creator.[fn-64-P6482_1911549:1162-nf] I think that we have already, in another passage,[fn-64-P6483_1911778:1163-nf] sufficiently shown that the glory of riches is condemned by our God, \"who putteth down the mighty from their throne, and exalts the poor from the dunghill.\"[fn-64-P6484_1911990:1164-nf] From Him, therefore, will proceed the parable of the rich man, who flattered himself about the increase of his fields, and to Whom God said: \"Thou fool, this night shall they require thy soul of thee; then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided? \"[fn-64-P6485_1912314:1165-nf] It was just in the like manner that the king Hezekiah heard from Isaiah the sad doom of his kingdom, when he gloried, before the envoys of Babylon,[fn-64-P6486_1912488:1166-nf] in his treasures and the deposits of his precious things.[fn-64-P6487_1912568:1167-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":113,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":36,"source_paragraph":"118","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But Christ prohibits divorce, saying, \"Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband, also committeth adultery.\"[fn-66-P6658_1950353:1320-nf] In order to forbid divorce, He makes it unlawful to marry a woman that has been put away. Moses, however, permitted repudiation in Deuteronomy: \"When a man hath taken a wife, and hath lived with her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found unchastity in her; then let him write her a bill of divorcement and give it in her hand, and send her away out of his house.\"[fn-66-P6659_1950781:1321-nf] You see, therefore, that there is a difference between the law and the gospel- between Moses and Christ?[fn-66-P6660_1950910:1322-nf] To be sure there is![fn-66-P6661_1950964:1323-nf] But then you have rejected that other gospel which witnesses to the same verity and the same Christ.[fn-66-P6662_1951081:1324-nf] There, while prohibiting divorce, He has given us a solution of this special question respecting it: \"Moses,\" says He, \"because of the hardness of your hearts, suffered you to give a bill of divorcement; but from the beginning it was not so\"[fn-66-P6663_1951354:1325-nf] -for this reason, indeed, because He who had \"made them male and female\" had likewise said, \"They twain shall become one flesh; what therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.\"[fn-66-P6664_1951572:1326-nf] Now, by this answer of His (to the Pharisees), He both sanctioned the provision of Moses, who was His own (servant), and restored to its primitive purpose[fn-66-P6665_1951753:1327-nf] the institution of the Creator, whose Christ He was. Since, however, you are to be refuted out of the Scriptures which you have received, I will meet you on your own ground, as if your Christ were mine. When, therefore, He prohibited divorce, and yet at the same time represented[fn-66-P6666_1952051:1328-nf] the Father, even Him who united male and female, must He not have rather exculpated[fn-66-P6667_1952153:1329-nf] than abolished the enactment of Moses? But, observe, if this Christ be yours when he teaches contrary to Moses and the Creator, on the same principle must He be mine if I can show that His teaching is not contrary to them. I maintain, then, that there was a condition in the prohibition which He now made of divorce; the case supposed being, that a man put away his wife for the express purpose of[fn-66-P6668_1952574:1330-nf] marrying another. His words are: \"Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband, also committeth adultery,\"[fn-66-P6669_1952791:1331-nf] -\"put away,\" that is, for the reason wherefore a woman ought not to be dismissed, that another wife may be obtained. For he who marries a woman who is unlawfully put away is as much of an adulterer as the man who marries one who is un-divorced. Permanent is the marriage which is not rightly dissolved; to marry,[fn-66-P6670_1953127:1332-nf] therefore, whilst matrimony is undissolved, is to commit adultery. Since, therefore, His prohibition of divorce was a conditional one, He did not prohibit absolutely; and what He did not absolutely forbid, that He permitted on some occasions,[fn-66-P6671_1953445:1333-nf] when there is an absence of the cause why He gave His prohibition. In very deed[fn-66-P6672_1953541:1334-nf] His teaching is not contrary to Moses, whose precept He partially[fn-66-P6673_1953651:1335-nf] defends, I will not[fn-66-P6674_1953689:1336-nf] say confirms. If, however, you deny that divorce is in any way permitted by Christ, how is it that you on your side[fn-66-P6675_1953822:1337-nf] destroy marriage, not uniting man and woman, nor admitting to the sacrament of baptism and of the eucharist those who have been united in marriage anywhere else,[fn-66-P6676_1953997:1338-nf] unless they should agree together to repudiate the fruit of their marriage, and so the very Creator Himself? Well, then, what is a husband to do in your sect,[fn-66-P6677_1954213:1339-nf] if his wife commit adultery? Shall he keep her? But your own apostle, you know,[fn-66-P6678_1954311:1340-nf] does not permit \"the members of Christ to be joined to a harlot.\"[fn-66-P6679_1954396:1341-nf] Divorce, therefore, when justly deserved,[fn-66-P6680_1954462:1342-nf] has even in Christ a defender. So that Moses for the future must be considered as being confirmed by Him, since he prohibits divorce in the same sense as Christ does, if any unchastity should occur in the wife. For in the Gospel of Matthew he says, \"Whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery.\"[fn-66-P6681_1954845:1343-nf] He also is deemed equally guilty of adultery, who marries a woman put away by her husband. The Creator, however, except on account of adultery, does not put asunder what He Himself joined together, the same Moses in another passage enacting that he who had married after violence to a damsel, should thenceforth not have it in his power to put away his wife.[fn-66-P6682_1955226:1344-nf] Now, if a compulsory marriage contracted after violence shall be permanent, how much rather shall a voluntary one, the result of agreement! This has the sanction of the prophet: \"Thou shalt not forsake the wife of thy youth.\"[fn-66-P6683_1955481:1345-nf] Thus you have Christ following spontaneously the tracks of the Creator everywhere, both in permitting divorce and in for-bidding it. You find Him also protecting marriage, in whatever direction you try to escape. He prohibits divorce when He will have the marriage inviolable; He permits divorce when the marriage is spotted with unfaithfulness. You should blush when you refuse to unite those whom even your Christ has united; and repeat the blush when you disunite them without the good reason why your Christ would have them separated. I have[fn-66-P6684_1956049:1346-nf] now to show whence the Lord derived this decision[fn-66-P6685_1956115:1347-nf] of His, and to what end He directed it. It will thus become more fully evident that His object was not the abolition of the Mosaic ordinance[fn-66-P6686_1956277:1348-nf] by any suddenly devised proposal of divorce; because it was not suddenly proposed, but had its root in the previously mentioned John. For John reproved Herod, because he had illegally married the wife of his deceased brother, who had a daughter by her (a union which the law permitted only on the one occasion of the brother dying childless,[fn-66-P6687_1956648:1349-nf] when it even prescribed such a marriage, in order that by his own brother, and from his own wife,[fn-66-P6688_1956811:1350-nf] seed might be reckoned to the deceased husband),[fn-66-P6689_1956904:1351-nf] and was in consequence cast into prison, and finally, by the same Herod, was even put to death. The Lord having therefore made mention of John, and of course of the occurrence of his death, hurled His censure[fn-66-P6690_1957139:1352-nf] against Herod in the form of unlawful marriages and of adultery, pronouncing as an adulterer even the man who married a woman that had been put away from her husband. This he said in order the more severely to load Herod with guilt, who had taken his brother's wife, after she had been loosed from her husband not less by death than by divorce; who had been impelled thereto by his lust, not by the prescription of the (Levirate) law-for, as his brother had left a daughter, the marriage with the widow could not be lawful on that very account;[fn-66-P6691_1957709:1353-nf] and who, when the prophet asserted against him the law, had therefore put him to death. The remarks I have advanced on this case will be also of use to me in illustrating the subsequent parable of the rich man[fn-66-P6692_1958021:1354-nf] tormented in hell, and the poor man resting in Abraham's bosom.[fn-66-P6693_1958128:1355-nf] For this passage, so far as its letter goes, comes before us abruptly; but if we regard its sense and purport, it naturally[fn-66-P6694_1958278:1356-nf] fits in with the mention of John wickedly slain, and of Herod, who had been condemned by him for his impious marriage.[fn-66-P6695_1958413:1357-nf] It sets forth in bold outline[fn-66-P6696_1958486:1358-nf] the end of both of them, the \"torments\" of Herod and the \"comfort\" of John, that even now Herod might hear that warning: \"They have there Moses and the prophets, let them hear them.\"[fn-66-P6697_1958689:1359-nf] Marcion, however, violently turns the passage to another end, and decides that both the torment and the comfort are retributions of the Creator reserved in the next life[fn-66-P6698_1958882:1360-nf] for those who have obeyed the law and the prophets; whilst he defines the heavenly bosom and harbour to belong to Christ and his own god. Our answer to this is, that the Scripture itself which dazzles[fn-66-P6699_1959142:1361-nf] his sight expressly distinguishes between Abraham's bosom, where the poor man dwells, and the infernal place of torment. \"Hell\" (I take it) means one thing, and \"Abraham's bosom\" another. \"A great gulf.\" is said to separate those regions, and to hinder a passage from one to the other. Besides, the rich man could not have \"lifted up his eyes,\"[fn-67-P6700_1959569:1362-nf] and from a distance too, except to a superior height, and from the said distance all up through the vast immensity of height and depth. It must therefore be evident to every man of intelligence who has ever heard of the Elysian fields, that there is some determinate place called Abraham's bosom, and that it is designed for the reception of the souls of Abraham's children, even from among the Gentiles (since he is \"the father of many nations,\" which must be classed amongst his family), and of the same faith as that wherewithal he himself believed God, without the yoke of the law and the sign of circumcision. This region, therefore, I call Abraham's bosom. Although it is not in heaven, it is yet higher than hell,[fn-67-P6701_1960313:1363-nf] and is appointed to afford an interval of rest to the souls of the righteous, until the consummation of all things shall complete the resurrection of all men with the \"full recompense of their reward.\"[fn-67-P6702_1960565:1364-nf] This consummation will then be manifested in heavenly promises, which Marcion, however, claims for his own god, just as if the Creator had never announced them. Amos, however, tells us of \"those stories towards heaven\"[fn-67-P6703_1960835:1365-nf] which Christ \"builds\"-of course for His people. There also is that everlasting abode of which Isaiah asks, \"Who shall declare unto you the eternal place, but He (that is, of course, Christ) who walketh in righteousness, speaketh of the straight path, hateth injustice and iniquity? \"[fn-67-P6704_1961363:1366-nf] Now, although this everlasting abode is promised, and the ascending stories (or steps) to heaven are built by the Creator, who further promises that the seed of Abraham shall be even as the stars of heaven, by virtue certainly of the heavenly promise, why may it not be possible,[fn-67-P6705_1961749:1367-nf] without any injury to that promise, that by Abraham's bosom is meant some temporary receptacle of faithful souls, wherein is even now delineated an image of the future, and where is given some foresight of the glory[fn-67-P6706_1961990:1368-nf] of both judgments? If so, you have here, O heretics, during your present lifetime, a warning that Moses and the prophets declare one only God, the Creator, and His only Christ, and how that both awards of everlasting punishment and eternal salvation rest with Him, the one only God, who kills and who makes alive. Well, but the admonition, says Marcion, of our God from heaven has commanded us not to hear Moses and the prophets, but Christ; Hear Him is the command.[fn-67-P6707_1962564:1369-nf] This is true enough. For the apostles had by that time sufficiently heard Moses and the prophets, for they had followed Christ, being persuaded by Moses and the prophets. For even Peter would not have been able[fn-67-P6708_1962835:1370-nf] to say, \"Thou art the Christ,\"[fn-67-P6709_1962892:1371-nf] unless he had beforehand heard and believed Moses and the prophets, by whom alone Christ had been hitherto announced. Their faith, indeed, had deserved this confirmation by such a voice from heaven as should bid them hear Him, whom they had recognized as preaching peace, announcing glad tidings, promising an everlasting abode, building for them steps upwards into heaven.[fn-67-P6710_1963289:1372-nf] Down in hell, however, it was said concerning them: \"They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them!\"-event hose who did not believe them or at least did not sincerely[fn-67-P6711_1963525:1373-nf] believe that after death there were punishments for the arrogance of wealth and the glory of luxury, announced indeed by Moses and the prophets, but decreed by that God, who deposes princes from their thrones, and raiseth up the poor from dunghills.[fn-67-P6712_1963792:1374-nf] Since, therefore, it is quite consistent in the Creator to pronounce different sentences in the two directions of reward and punishment, we shall have to conclude that there is here no diversity of gods,[fn-67-P6713_1964055:1375-nf] but only a difference in the actual matters[fn-67-P6714_1964138:1376-nf] before us.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":113,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_31_on_virginity","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"56","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But seeing that Paradise is the home of living spirits, and will not admit those who are dead in sin, and that we on the other hand are fleshly, subject to death, and sold under sin[fn-27-P2773_1886870:87-nf] , how is it possible that one who is a subject of death's empire should ever dwell in this land where all is life? What method of release from this jurisdiction can be devised? Here too the Gospel teaching is abundantly sufficient. We hear our Lord saying to Nicodemus, \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit[fn-27-P2774_1887343:88-nf] .\" We know too that the flesh is subject to death because of sin, but the Spirit of God is both incorruptible, and life-giving, and deathless. As at our physical birth there comes into the world with us a potentiality of being again turned to dust, plainly the Spirit also imparts a life-giving potentiality to the children begotten by Himself. What lesson, then, results from these remarks? This: that we should wean ourselves from this life in the flesh, which has an inevitable follower, death; and that we should search for a manner of life which does not bring death in its train. Now the life of Virginity is such a life. We will add a few other things to show how true this is. Every one knows that the propagation of mortal frames is the work which the intercourse of the sexes has to do; whereas for those who are joined to the Spirit, life and immortality instead of children are produced by this latter intercourse; and the words of the Apostle beautifully suit their case, for the joyful mother of such children as these \"shall be saved in child-bearing[fn-27-P2775_1888430:89-nf] ;\" as the Psalmist in his divine songs thankfully cries, \"He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children[fn-27-P2776_1888588:90-nf] .\" Truly a joyful mother is the virgin mother who by the operation of the Spirit conceives the deathless children, and who is called by the Prophet barren because of her modesty only. This life, then, which is stronger than the power of death, is, to those who think, the preferable one. The physical bringing of children into the world-I speak without wishing to offend-is as much a starting-point of death as of life; because from the moment of birth the process of dying commences. But those who by virginity have desisted from this process have drawn within themselves the boundary line of death, and by their own deed have checked his advance; they have made themselves, in fact, a frontier between life and death, and a barrier too, which thwarts him. If, then, death cannot pass beyond virginity, but finds his power checked and shattered there, it is demonstrated that virginity is a stronger thing than death; and that body is rightly named undying which does not lend its service to a dying world, nor brook to become the instrument of a succession of dying creatures. In such a body the long unbroken career of decay and death, which has intervened between[fn-27-P2777_1889775:91-nf] the first man and the lives of virginity which have been led, is interrupted. It could not be indeed that death should cease working as long as the human race by marriage was working too; he walked the path of life with all preceding generations; he started with every new-born child and accompanied it to the end: but he found in virginity a barrier, to pass which was an impossible feat. Just as, in the age of Mary the mother of God, he who had reigned from Adam to her time found, when he came to her and dashed his forces against the fruit of her virginity as against a rock, that he was shattered to pieces upon her, so in every soul which passes through this life in the flesh under the protection of virginity, the strength of death is in a manner broken and annulled, for he does not find the places upon which he may fix his sting. If you do not throw into the fire wood, or straw, or grass, or something that it can consume, it has not the force to last by itself; so the power of death cannot go on working, if marriage does not supply it with material and prepare victims for this executioner. If you have any doubts left, consider the actual names of those afflictions which death brings upon mankind, and which were detailed in the first part of this discourse. Whence do they get their meaning? \"Widowhood,\" \"orphanhood,\" \"loss of children,\" could they be a subject for grief, if marriage did not precede? Nay, all the dearly-prized blisses, and transports, and comforts of marriage end in these agonies of grief, The hilt of a sword is smooth and handy, and polished and glittering outside; it seems to grow to the outline of the hand[fn-27-P2778_1891533:92-nf] ; but the other part is steel and the instrument of death, formidable to look at, more formidable still to come across. Such a thing is marriage. It offers for the grasp of the senses a smooth surface of delights, like a hilt of rare polish and beautiful workmanship; but when a man has taken it up and has got it into his hands, he finds the pain that has been wedded to it is in his hands as well; and it becomes to him the worker of mourning and of loss. It is marriage that has the heartrending spectacles to show of children left desolate in the tenderness of their years, a mere prey to the powerful, yet smiling often at their misfortune from ignorance of coming woes. What is the cause of widowhood but marriage? And retirement from this would bring with it an immunity from the whole burden of these sad taxes on our hearts. Can we expect it otherwise? When the verdict that was pronounced on the delinquents in the beginning is annulled, then too the mothers' \"sorrows[fn-27-P2779_1892575:93-nf] \" are no longer \"multiplied,\" nor does \"sorrow\" herald the births of men; then all calamity has been removed from life and \"tears wiped from off all faces[fn-27-P2780_1892748:94-nf] ;\" conception is no more an iniquity, nor child-bearing a sin; and births shall be no more \"of bloods,\" or \"of the will of man,\" or \"of the will of the flesh[fn-27-P2781_1892922:95-nf] \", but of God alone. This is always happening whenever any one in a lively heart conceives all the integrity of the Spirit, and brings forth wisdom and righteousness, and sanctification and redemption too. It is possible for any one to be the mother of such a son; as our Lord says, \"He that doeth my will is my brother, my sister, and my mother[fn-27-P2782_1893288:96-nf] .\" What room is there for death in such parturitions? Indeed in them death is swallowed up by life. In fact, the Life of Virginity seems to be an actual representation of the blessedness in the world to come, showing as it does in itself so many signs of the presence of those expected blessings which are reserved for us there. That the truth of this statement may be perceived, we will verify it thus. It is so, first, because a man who has thus died once for all to sin lives for the future to God; he brings forth no more fruit unto death; and having so far as in him lies made an end[fn-27-P2783_1893900:97-nf] of this life within him according to the flesh, he awaits thenceforth the expected blessing of the manifestation[fn-27-P2784_1894069:98-nf] of the great God, refraining from putting any distance between himself and this coming of God by an intervening posterity: secondly, because he enjoys even in this present life a certain exquisite glory of all the blessed results of our resurrection. For our Lord has announced that the life after our resurrection shall be as that of the angels. Now the peculiarity of the angelic nature is that they are strangers to marriage; therefore the blessing of this promise has been already received by him who has not only mingled his own glory with the halo of the Saints, but also by the stainlessness of his life has so imitated the purity of these incorporeal beings. If virginity then can win us favours such as these, what words are fit to express the admiration of so great a grace? What other gift of the soul can be found so great and precious as not to suffer by comparison with this perfection?","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":113,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_128_on_the_glory_of_martyrdom_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"ANF-05","text":"5.

But so far did the blessed Apostle recognize that what we say is true, that he actually wished to depart from this flesh; that by separation from it, he might be able to be joined more earnestly to the Lord; saying: \"I desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, which is far better, for while we are in the body we are absent from the Lord:\" and therefore \"we are bold and have our desire always to be absent from the body, and present with the Lord.

For we read that many were slain in mercy by Moses the servant of the Lord; for in that he prayed thus in intercession to the Lord for their wicked sacrilege, saying, \"O Lord, if Thou wilt forgive their sin-; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of the book which Thou hast written,\"[fn-53-P5319_2567399:242-nf] his unspeakable charity and mercy are plainly shown.

Consider, therefore, whether it may not be a sign of greater anger on the part of God, that, whilst so many laws have been enacted against you, you have not been ordered by any emperor to be put to death.

Hearken to the Lord speaking through His prophet: \"From the rising of the sun, even unto the going down of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering; for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith the Lord of hosts.\"[fn-53-P5320_2568198:243-nf] On this brother's sacrifice you show that you look with malignant eyes, over and above the respect which God pays to it; and if ye have ever heard that \"from the rising of the sun, unto the going down of the same, the Lord's name is to be praised,\"[fn-53-P5321_2568466:244-nf] which is that living sacrifice of which it is said, \"Offer unto God thanksgiving,\"[fn-53-P5322_2568570:245-nf] then will your countenance fall like that of yonder murderer.
